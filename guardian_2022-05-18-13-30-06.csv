5/18/2022,"As the election approaches, and with both parties committed to large tax cuts for high-income earners, the difficulty of financing even modest electoral commitments is becoming evident. As a result, we are seeing a resort to time-honoured expedients for saving money in ways that appear painless. Labor has promised to reduce spending on consultants and conduct an “audit” of government waste. The government has responded in kind with a plan to increase the annual efficiency dividend imposed on the public service, from 1.5% to 2%. The efficiency dividend was first imposed under the Hawke government in 1987. Officially, the idea was motivated by the then-nascent information technology revolution, which was expected to yield spectacular gains in productivity. Behind this rhetoric was a belief held by many in the government that there was plenty of slack in the public service, and that managers could find savings if they had to. Three and a half decades on, the cumulative impact of the efficiency dividends is a real reduction of between 40% and 50%. That should have produced a massive saving. But the reality is quite different. As with most office-based businesses, the actual costs of running the public service have risen over time, even after adjusting for inflation. The number of public service employees has risen, as has the average real wage they earn. What has gone wrong, and what are the lessons that should be learned about efficiency dividends? First, while we have seen amazing progress in technological terms (a smartwatch has more computing power than the fastest supercomputers of the 1980s), this hasn’t translated into massive productivity gains. This was already becoming evident to astute observers when the productivity dividend was introduced. In the same year, the Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Solow observed: “You see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” In fact, across the economy as a whole productivity growth has been slow. The microeconomic reform program of which the efficiency dividend was a part delivered some initial gains but these quickly petered out. Still, labour productivity growth has averaged about 1.5% annually, suggesting to some observers that an efficiency dividend at this rate is sustainable. The problem with this argument is that labour productivity growth is the source of increases in real wages and living standards. While wage growth has fallen somewhat short of productivity growth, the idea that real wages could be held indefinitely at 1987 levels is a nonsense. The only way to secure continuing efficiency dividends would be if productivity in the public service grew more rapidly than for the economy as a whole. How then, has the efficiency dividend been sustained? The answer is that the efficiency dividend amounts to an automatic cut in the provision of public services, with the choice of what to cut being left to individual departments and agencies. The savings are then used to announce new programs, many of which do little more than fill the gaps created by earlier cuts. It’s easy to see the political appeal of this process to governments of either party. The cuts associated with the efficiency dividend are too small to be noticed in any given year, and can’t easily be identified. By contrast, the new programs they finance give ministers plenty of opportunities to make themselves popular. As numerous reports and independent analyses have concluded, the cumulative effect of unplanned cuts is to hollow out the core capacities of governments, while loosening discipline on new programs. Two consequences of this process are particularly noticeable. First, even as the basic functions of government have been eroded, we’ve seen a steady increase in low-level pork-barrelling, exemplified by the sports rorts and station car parks scandal. Projects that should have been undertaken, if at all, by state and local governments have instead been opportunities for federal ministers to hand out novelty checks. Second, since policy analysis is an easy target for cuts with little initial impact, we’ve seen increasing resort to high-priced consultants to do work that should have been undertaken in-house. And this brings us back full circle, to Labor’s promise to cut spending on consultants. That’s a good idea but not a source of free money to be allocated to fund election promises. The only sustainable way to reduce spending on consultants is to increase the policy capacity of the public service. That in turn means scrapping efficiency dividends.

5/18/2022,"Anti-abortion Facebook pages with millions of followers are spreading disinformation about abortion to Spanish speakers with little to no intervention from the social media platform, according to a new report from Naral Pro-Choice America. The abortion rights group examined nine Facebook pages that reach more than 2.79 million people for the first-of-its-kind report, part of its efforts to show how disinformation is disseminated by opponents of abortion. Researchers found that several of the pages “repeatedly spread medically inaccurate information about abortion without any action from Facebook”, highlighting what experts have described as a crisis of Spanish-language misinformation that’s slipping through the cracks. The report comes as reproductive rights are in peril in the US with the supreme court expected to overturn the landmark Roe v Wade ruling, which guaranteed the right to abortion in the US. “It has never been more critical for people to have access to medically accurate information about abortion – no matter the language they speak. What’s clear here is that anti-choice extremists are capitalizing on social media companies’ failure to moderate Spanish-language disinformation,” Mini Timmaraju, the Naral Pro-Choice America president, said in a statement. Research from the group found that articles in Spanish focused on US abortion policy that received the most engagement on social media “overwhelmingly lean anti-choice” and come from outlets with religious affiliations. Many of the Spanish-language Facebook pages examined by Naral researchers spread disinformation about the safety of abortion, claiming that it leads to increased risk of breast cancer, anxiety, infertility, depression and suicide. Some posts have been viewed thousands of times without intervention from Facebook. The content spreads the same disinformation about abortion as English-language anti-abortion groups, which also push medically inaccurate information about abortion and demonizes abortion providers, the report says. Catholicism plays a key role in much of the Spanish-language content, which suggests that support for abortion care conflicts with religious identity. The Spanish-speaking anti-abortion movement relies on stereotypes, said Gabriela Rico, the lead researcher for the report, such as that Latinx people widely oppose abortion and are all Catholic. “This is not only a false, racist assumption, but a way for the anti-choice movement to erase the majority of Latinx people who support reproductive freedom – often because of, not in spite of, their faith,” Rico, a Naral research manger, said. A recent Navigator Research poll found that 65% of Hispanic Americans support Congress passing a law to guarantee the right to an abortion in the US. The spread of abortion disinformation is part of Facebook’s broader failure to moderate Spanish-language content, experts say. A study last year found that only 30% of misinformation in Spanish is flagged with warning labels, compared to 70% in English. Lawmakers have called on the company to do more to address what they deemed a “disinformation crisis”. In a response to lawmakers, Facebook focused on the resources the company has put into limiting misinformation, stating that it has “35,000 people working on these challenges”. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Naral’s findings. Multiple social media platforms have failed to stop disinformation about abortion in Spanish and English, but Facebook’s moderation decisions have been “particularly problematic”, the report said. The failure to remove abortion disinformation has “direct implications for the 72% of Latinx people in the United States who use its platform”, the report states. “Latinx communities are targeted with anti-choice disinformation constantly – I have seen this not only in my work on this report, but in my own family and community,” Rico said. “Spanish-speaking people deserve to receive accurate information about reproductive freedom, not to be lied to and used as pawns in a political game.”",News/Technology,"Facebook fails to stop Spanish language anti-abortion disinformation, study says",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/17/spanish-anti-abortion-facebook-pages-disinformation
5/18/2022,"School principals in New South Wales say they need urgent help to manage increasingly poor behaviour by parents on social media, with online pile-ons and slanging matches creating unnecessary stress and increased workloads. Almost 90% of NSW school leaders told the 2021 NSW Secondary Principals’ Council (SPC) survey that “social media hate campaigns” from parents were affecting their wellbeing and occupying their time. SPC president, Craig Petersen, said parents had forgotten how to deal with problems face to face or over the phone and it was creating an unsustainable position for principals who were being left bogged down and demoralised. “If I’ve got a gripe with the school, I’m not necessarily going to ring up the office and make an appointment see the principal, I’m just going to give the school or the teacher or the principal a blast on Facebook,” he said of parent behaviour. “Once it goes up on Facebook and people start piggybacking on to it, suddenly, we can’t actually manage that situation any more. “You can easily end up with a relatively minor matter that could have been easily resolved, taking not just hours, but in some cases days.” Principals reported parents sparking inappropriate discussions about everything from individual teachers and planned excursions to suspensions, expulsions and departmental decisions. When principals need to respond to student use of social media, it’s usually due to incidents between students, whereas with parents it’s often the school, teachers or the principal themselves who are under attack. Current complaints handling processes mean when a social media pile-on occurs on a specific post, each parent has to be contacted and have their issue dealt with separately, adding to the time taken to resolve an issue. While a similar number of principals reported issues with parental behaviour online in the 2019 survey, the council says anecdotally the problem has worsened during the pandemic. Ulladulla High School principal, Denise Lofts, has been leading schools for 13 years and said parent behaviour had worsened, noting vaccines had been a major flashpoint. “People [used to be] coming in and screaming in your front office. Now they don’t do that. They go and scream online,” she said. “I’m dealing with stuff that I’ve never really had to deal with, in terms of people’s inability to relate in a sensible and controlled manner.” Petersen called for dedicated social media staff for schools so teachers and principals could return to doing their jobs. “In most schools we will be using a member of the teaching staff to do our website and our social media management,” he said. “Appoint people who’ve got the expertise to manage the finance, manage the assets, manage the social media – all the things that are coming up in that survey that are taking us away from the work.” Lofts – also the council deputy president – said principals required access to support and advice in the moment when they’re “being targeted”. “It’s been the undoing of many a good principal.” Speaking after a roundtable with teachers last week, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, flagged he was looking at boosting admin staff for schools to reduce the workload on school staff. “There’s a lot of time that is taken away from our teaching staff into areas of administration that we should look at,” he said. “Every business out there has administrative staff, so the business can get on doing business. We need our teachers focusing on teaching, not being caught up.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The survey, the first since 2019, also found 80% of principals were facing increased stress and workload due to a lack of resources and almost a quarter of principals planned to retire within three years. Opposition leader Chris Minns described the survey as “sober reading” and called on the government to address principals’ concerns. “Excessive burnout and extreme stress should not be an accepted part of a teacher’s job and the government needs to acknowledge the severity of the issues and fix them,” he said.
