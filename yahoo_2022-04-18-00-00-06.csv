4/18/2022,"Shawnee State University in Ohio has reached a settlement with a professor whom it punished for refusing to use a transgender student’s preferred pronouns, according to a new report. The university will pay philosophy professor Nick Meriwether $400,000 in damages and attorney fees and will rescind a written warning it issued to Meriwether in June 2018 in response to a biological male student’s complaint that the professor refused to use female pronouns for the student, Fox News reported. The controversy began in January 18 when Meriwether responded to the student’s question during a political philosophy class by saying, “Yes, sir.” After class, the student told the professor that the student is transgender and asked to be referred to as a woman going forward, including with “feminine titles and pronouns,” according to the Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented Meriwether in court. The professor argued that obliging the student’s requests would violate his own convictions as a Christian. When the professor declined to use female pronouns, the student became belligerent and told Meriwether he would be fired, according to court documents cited by Fox News. The student then filed a complaint with Shawnee State, which opened an investigation into the incident. The university found that the professor “effectively created a hostile environment” for the student by not using the preferred pronouns. Meriwether offered to call the student by any name requested, however. The student did not accept the professor’s offer, according to the report. The university placed a written warning in the professor’s personnel file warning that “further corrective actions” could be taken if a similar incident occurred. Meriwether then sued the university, arguing that it violated his “right to free exercise of religion under the First Amendment.” The settlement comes after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit reversed a district court’s dismissal of the lawsuit in March 2021, allowing the professor’s lawsuit to move forward. ADF announced last week that it reached a settlement with the university. “Public universities should welcome intellectual and ideological diversity, where all students and professors can engage in meaningful discussions without compromising their core beliefs,” said ADF Senior Counsel Tyson Langhofer, director of the ADF Center for Academic Freedom. “Dr. Meriwether rightly defended his freedom to speak and stay silent, and not conform to the university’s demand for uniformity of thought. We commend the university for ultimately agreeing to do the right thing, in keeping with its reason for existence as a marketplace of ideas.” Court Awards Full Custody to James Younger’s Mother but Requires Permission for Puberty Blockers, Gender Surgeries Arkansas Governor Says Veto of Trans Youth Bill Aligns with Conservative Values Spain Expands Free Fertility Treatment to Lesbians, Single Women, Transgender People",U.S./National Review,"University to Pay $400,000 to Professor Punished for Refusing to Use Student’s Preferred Pronouns",https://news.yahoo.com/university-pay-400-000-professor-134249803.html
4/18/2022,"Kei Komuro, 30, the husband of former Japanese princess Mako Komuro, has failed the New York state bar exam for the second time.

Kei, who graduated from New York’s Fordham University law school in 2021, first attempted the bar that same year.

His second exam took place in February of this year, and his name did not appear on the pass list released on Thursday. He currently works at the Lowenstein Sandler law firm in Manhattan where the couple resides.

The couple moved to New York last year after marrying in Japan. Their marriage was highly scrutinized by the media due to Komuro’s commoner status. Due to the public criticism, Mako was said to have developed post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the imperial household agency.

Mako’s father, Fumihito, is the crown prince and first in line for the throne. Emperor Naruhito, the current monarch of Japan, has only one child: Princess Aiko. Japanese law dictates that only royal males can inherit the throne. Consequently, the emperor’s younger brother and Mako’s father became the official heir in 2020.

Former Japanese princess Mako was forced to renounce her titles and the $1.3 million payout typically given to female royals after she married her college sweetheart, now-husband. She recently secured a volunteer gig helping curators prepare an exhibition of Asian paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

The New York bar exam is offered four times a year, twice in February and twice in July, and takers are given an unlimited number of times to pass. It is unclear when or if Kei intends to take the test again.
