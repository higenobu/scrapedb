3/24/2022,"Hannah Clarke discovered a threatening note on her estranged husband’s phone that said her children “will miss you I’m sure” a month before he killed them in a suburban Brisbane street, an inquest has heard. The note, discovered by Hannah Clarke on 26 January 2020, said “you can’t fuck with someone’s life like this and expect them to just take it”, the inquest was told. “I have told the kids that you loved them. They will miss you I’m sure,” counsel assisting the coroner Jacoba Brasch QC told the inquest, reading from the note found on Rowan Baxter’s phone. “You destroyed my life and I cannot move on. I hope all this was worth it for you and your family.” The comments came during the fourth day of the inquest held into the deaths of Hannah Clarke and her children – Aaliyah, 6, Laianah, 4, and Trey, 3. The inquest also heard that Baxter had once dropped his estranged mother-in-law during an exercise at the gym, causing her face to split open. “He laughed at me and told me to ‘harden up’, that it happens all the time if you play football,” his mother-in-law, Sue Clarke, told the inquest. Clarke said after he dropped her, Baxter continued laughing at her until other members at the gym pointed out that it was inappropriate. She said her daughter’s estranged husband would belittle her at the gym and treated her “terribly”. “He lacked empathy with anybody,” she told the inquest. Hannah Clarke was taking her children to school when Baxter jumped inside the car holding a jerry can and knife. He doused her and the children in petrol and set them alight in the Brisbane suburb of Camp Hill in February 2020. In the years since, Clarke’s parents, Sue and Lloyd Clarke, have worked tirelessly to bring attention to domestic abuse and coercive control. Queensland is now considering making coercive control a criminal offence. Clarke told the inquest that her daughter “walked on eggshells” around Baxter and that if she did something Baxter classed as “misbehaving”, he would not let her look after her grandchildren. “If I spoke out I would get phone calls in tears,” she said, referring to her daughter. “‘Please Mum, apologise’. She’d be so distraught that I’d have to ring and apologise.” She told the inquest that Baxter would refer to women as “fat pigs” and would not let his wife wear shorts or the colour pink. Clarke said her daughter spoke to her about needing to write a will for the children as she feared Baxter would kill her. Aaliyah, Hannah’s eldest child, was also afraid of Baxter, the inquest heard. “She’d seen so much. She would stand up to her father,” Clarke told the inquest. “He would yell at [Hannah] and storm out of the house, and [Aaliyah] would slam the door and say and ‘don’t come back’. “She was outspoken … and she would be in trouble for coming into adult business.” Clarke told the inquest that Baxter kidnapped Laianah on Boxing Day 2019 and held her for three days, causing Aaliyah to become “angry” and scrunch her hands into “little fists”. She said that after the abduction, she would have to reassure Aaliyah every morning that she wasn’t going to see her father that day. “Even then, when she did have to go … she’d be on the footpath crying not wanting to get in the car.” Clarke described another occasion two weeks before he murdered the family where Baxter attempted to break her daughter’s wrist when he was dropping off Trey. She said when her daughter ran out of the house and told Baxter she would call the police, he responded by calling her “a mole”.

Clarke said her daughter believed Baxter was recording her conversations, listening to her phone calls and anything she said in her car. She said Baxter once snuck into her house while her daughter was living there with the children. “Hannah … felt, like a shiver, and he was standing there staring at her,” said Clarke. Clarke said she wanted people to remember her daughter as a “strong” woman who loved her children “and would do anything to save them”. “She wasn’t perfect, nobody’s perfect, but she was a beautiful soul, she really was.” In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

3/24/2022,"Up to 450 refugees from Australia’s regional processing centres will be resettled in New Zealand over the next three years, after the Coalition belatedly took up a long-standing agreement struck more than nine years ago. Up to 150 refugees a year will be able to go to New Zealand, under the deal announced by Australia’s home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, and the New Zealand immigration minister, Kris Faafoi, on Thursday. The arrangement is open only to refugees in Nauru or those who are “temporarily in Australia under regional processing arrangements”. It is not open to those who are “engaged in other third country resettlement pathways”, such as the arrangement Australia has with the US. Amnesty International said there were 112 refugees on Nauru, and another 1,168 in Australia for medical treatment, who the charity said would be eligible for resettlement under the deal. The resettlement arrangement was struck more than nine years ago, under then prime minister Julia Gillard in February 2013. Labor lost office at the federal election later that year, and the deal was not taken up by the Coalition until now. The Coalition repeatedly argued that accepting the deal might encourage a resumption of asylum-seekers attempting to travel by boat to Australia. In 2018 the then home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said taking up the offer “would be a pull factor at this point in time”. The same year the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the government was “very concerned that that could risk this thing opening up again”. On Thursday, Andrews said that “Australia’s strong border protection policies had not changed”, and the resettlement plan would not apply to people who attempted to come to Australia in future. “Australia remains firm – illegal maritime arrivals will not settle here permanently,” Andrews said in a statement on Thursday. “Anyone who attempts to breach our borders will be turned back or sent to Nauru.” Faafoi said his country was happy to take the refugees. “New Zealand is very pleased that Australia has taken up the offer to resettle up to 150 refugees annually for three years,” he said. “We are pleased to be able to provide resettlement outcomes for refugees who would otherwise have continued to face uncertain futures.” The Australian Greens’ immigration spokesman, Nick McKim, said the deal was “a blessed, belated relief”, but said it took far too long for the Australian government to accept New Zealand’s offer. “The last decade of offshore detention has been a dark and bloody chapter in our country’s story, and its bipartisan foundation remains a national shame,” McKim said in a statement.“We know that the people of New Zealand will open their arms to all those who are resettled there, and give them the welcome they should have had in Australia years ago.” Amnesty International Australia’s refugee adviser, Graham Thom, said the belated acceptance of the deal meant that “people have had years of their lives taken from them pointlessly”. “Sadly the 104 people still trapped [in Papua New Guinea] fall outside the scope of this deal and solutions will still need to be found for them,” Thom said. The prominent refugee advocate Craig Foster said the announcement was a “small step to recovering Australia’s humanity and there is much work ahead”. “I thank everyone raising their voice around Australia for a commitment to basic decency, our high profile ambassadors, Jacinda Ardern, and say well done to Scott Morrison on finally taking the right action,” Foster said. “It’s just the start, Scott, there are many more steps required to dismantle this beastly system.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had long been calling on the Australian government to take up the offer. The UNHCR regional representative for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific, Adrian Edwards, welcomed Thursday’s announcement, but said: “For the refugees and asylum seekers, the prolonged uncertainty of their situation has taken an enormous toll.” Edwards said the UNHCR was not a party to the arrangement, but because of the “compelling humanitarian circumstances” had indicated its in-principle readiness to facilitate the process of resettlement referrals to New Zealand.",News/Australia news,"Australia agrees 450 refugees can be resettled in New Zealand, nine years after deal first offered",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/australia-agrees-450-refugees-can-be-resettled-in-new-zealand-nine-years-after-deal-first-offered

3/24/2022,"A Manhattan prosecutor who investigated Donald Trump’s financial dealings wrote in a resignation letter that he believed Trump “is guilty of numerous felony violations” and blasted the new district attorney for not moving ahead with an indictment, the New York Times reported. Mark Pomerantz and Carey Dunne, two top prosecutors on the Manhattan district attorney’s criminal investigation of Trump, resigned abruptly last month, amid reports that the investigation into the former president’s finances was foundering. The newly elected district attorney, Alvin Bragg, was reportedly more skeptical than his predecessor that the evidence his office’s attorneys had gathered against Trump would be enough to convict him. In a February resignation letter obtained by the New York Times, Pomerantz wrote that the team of lawyers investigating Trump had “no doubt” he had “committed crimes” and that Bragg’s decision not to move ahead with prosecuting Trump “will doom any future prospects that Mr Trump will be prosecuted for the criminal conduct we have been investigating”. “His financial statements were false, and he has a long history of fabricating information relating to his personal finances and lying about his assets to banks, the national media, counterparties, and many others, including the American people,” Pomerantz reportedly wrote. The clock is ticking on the case against Trump, as the current term of the grand jury which has been hearing evidence expires in April. Ronald Fischetti, an attorney for Trump, told the Guardian that the resignation letter simply reflected the prosecuting team’s failure to make a convincing legal case against the former president, describing his client’s “innocence”. “Pomerantz had several occasions to meet with Alvin Bragg, the district attorney, and his senior staff to lay out exactly what he intended to present to the grand jury in order to get an indictment, and he failed,” Fischetti said. “He was unable to convince the DA and his senior staff that he had sufficient evidence to warrant an indictment.” “Mr Bragg should be commended for not doing this on the basis of politics, and just doing it on the basis of law, which he’s supposed to do,” Fischetti said. While the resignation letter conceded that the case against Trump could be challenging and that there were “risks” of bringing it to court, it argued that there was a strong public interest in prosecuting Trump “even if a conviction is not certain”. The former Manhattan district attorney Cy Vance, who had been deeply involved in the case, had “directed the team to present evidence to a grand jury and to seek an indictment of Mr Trump and other defendants as soon as reasonably possible”, Pomerantz reportedly wrote, but Bragg, who was sworn in this January, reviewed the case and did not agree. Pomerantz believed Bragg’s decision not to seek an indictment of Trump was “made in good faith” but also “misguided and completely contrary to the public interest”. Pomerantz did not respond to a request for comment. “The investigation continues,” Danielle Filson, a spokesperson for the district attorney, wrote in an email. “A team of experienced prosecutors is working every day to follow the facts and the law. There is nothing we can or should say at this juncture about an ongoing investigation.” A spokesperson for the Trump Organization called Pomerantz a “never-Trumper” in a statement to the New York Times.",News/US news,"Trump committed ‘numerous’ felonies, said resigning New York prosecutor – report",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/donald-trump-crime-accusation-prosecutor-mark-pomerantz
