3/4/2022,"Airbnb has suspended all operations in Russia and Belarus, and stopped users of the home rental site from both countries from making any bookings, in the company’s latest response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The home rental firm, which has almost 100,000 short-term rentals available across both countries according to market research firm AirDNA, has been vocal in its support of Ukraine. The co-founder and chief executive of Airbnb, Brian Chesky, who has added the Ukrainian flag to his Twitter profile, tweeted the suspension in a one-line post. Airbnb is suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus The company elaborated on Chesky’s tweet, adding that the ban would extend to Airbnb members of those countries also trying to make any bookings on the site. “This means that we will block calendars from accepting new bookings in both countries until further notice,” said a spokeswoman for the company. “We will also restrict users in Belarus and Russia from making new reservations as guests. We certainly hope that as we look to the future, a path to peace is forged.” Russia has more than 93,000 listings on Airbnb, and Belarus almost 4,000, according to AirDNA. On Thursday, Airbnb waived fees for hosts and those booking rentals in Ukraine. It made the decision to do so after members of the public began making bookings in Ukraine – with no intention of travelling – as a way of providing financial support to residents facing hardship during the invasion. Ukraine has more than 17,000 active short-term rental listings. On Monday, Airbnb pledged to offer free housing to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. The company has said that it has received “overwhelming support” to the initiative, with more than 260,000 visitors so far to a dedicated web page where it is possible to sign up to be a host or to donate. Earlier this week, the 40-year-old Chesky said that the company was assessing its options regarding its Russian operation. “We don’t have a large business in Russia,” he told CNN. “It is not one of our major markets. [But] we are absolutely revisiting our relationship [about whether] to do business in Russia.” Last year, Airbnb took bookings for 300m nights across 4 million hosts globally, worth a total of $46.8bn (£35.3bn). The company, which was founded in 2008, was floated in 2020, soaring to a market value of about $100bn. Airbnb joins a rapidly increasing and extensive list of companies that are severing ties or pausing operations in Russia, including Ikea, the global recruitment company Hays, Apple, Netflix and all the major Hollywood studios, the retailers H&M, Marks & Spencer, Burberry and Boohoo, and car manufacturers including Ford, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.",News/Technology,Airbnb suspends all operations in Russia and Belarus,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/04/airbnb-suspends-all-operations-in-russia-and-belarus
3/4/2022,"When Chelsea and Manchester City step out at a sold-out Plough Lane on Saturday, it will be, somewhat incomprehensibly, the first time English football’s two dominant teams of recent years have met in a cup final. Since 2014 they have played one another in seven semi-finals and two quarter-finals and the Chelsea full-back Jonna Andersson is relishing the Continental League Cup final. “Finally,” she said. “We always say that we’re going to get them in the semi-finals. We were quite surprised when we didn’t, and now it’s finally a final. Hopefully both teams are happy about it because it’s a good final for us to play but also for people watching.” Chelsea are six points above City in the league with a game in hand and have done the WSL double over them, but any suggestion that Saturday may not be a contest would be far from the mark. City staggered early in the season, hindered by injuries, losing seven of their first 14 games in all competitions. Since then, though, they have had one defeat in 12 games: 1-0 against Chelsea. Chelsea faltered too, picking up one win in five after their swashbuckling 3-0 defeat of Arsenal in the FA Cup final at the start of December, but are since unbeaten in six. Emma Hayes’s Chelsea are perhaps still favourites, although we are yet to see whether the off-field turmoil around the club seeps on to it. For Andersson, dealing with City’s potent wingers Lauren Hemp and Jess Park will be key. “They have so many good players and especially wingers that like going forward with a lot of pace and that are very good one versus one,” she said. “We just need to focus on our gameplan and what we can do, but of course we need to try to stop them as well because we know that’s one of their biggest threats.” It is in defence where Hayes has been most experimental this season and Andersson and the rest of the players who rotate along the backline have taken time to get used to the switches between a back four and back three. “You just need to be flexible and really, really understand the different kinds of formations because you have to be able to switch between them as well in games or in weeks,” the Sweden international said. “I want to be an attacking full-back. When I’ve been playing as a wing-back in 3-4-3 or 3-5-2 of course I need to be more involved in maybe the one versus one attacking plays so I have to try to improve these kinds of things. When I’ve been a full-back as a back four it’s maybe more coming from behind running overlaps and underlaps.” Andersson has had a solid season, bouncing back from a tough end to the previous campaign, when she was dropped to the bench for Chelsea’s Champions League semi-final second leg and final. “You have these moments during the season, during the games,” she said. “That was maybe a tougher period for me personally, but I still think it’s a team sport and you need to try to stick together. It was a tough time, but I think I’ve learned a lot from it as well and have come out stronger.” She has had to. It had been expected by many that Hayes would dip into the transfer market to improve her options at full-back and the manager admitted early in the season: “It’s not that we didn’t target players, we just didn’t get the ones that we wanted.” Andersson was unfazed by the chatter. “That’s something the media has said – Emma has never said it to me – but I also know that I need to be on top in training and games to be able to play and start for Chelsea. That probably just gives me more energy. It shows that I need to improve and get better every day.” It is that kind of fight that Hayes looks for in players and is something Chelsea need to power them to an unbeaten run to the end of the season if they are to retain their domestic treble. “I’m not going to say we’re used to [winning and the pressure] but that’s where we want to be; we want to win everything we can,” Andersson said. “If we drop some points there is still going to be a big chance to win the league. It’s not finished yet. You can’t tell who’s going to win or who’s going to be the second or third, it’s so even, and you need to take every game as a final.” ",Sport/Football,Jonna Andersson relishes Chelsea meeting with City in League Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/04/jonna-andersson-relishes-chelsea-meeting-with-city-in-league-cup-final
3/4/2022,"As the CIA and MI6 try to predict the next gambit of the unstable leader in the Kremlin, Britons flinch at reports of the possible use of nuclear weapons. But this is 1962; Khrushchev not Putin. ITV’s new adaptation of Len Deighton’s cold war novel The Ipcress File – which was a 60s-defining movie starring Michael Caine as the working-class spy Harry Palmer – was meant to be a period piece for 2022 viewers. But the Russian president’s invasion of Ukraine, and pointed reminders to the world about the size of his nuclear weapons, have given the Sunday night drama a new context. “I thought I was writing history, but it turned out to be current affairs,” says screenwriter John Hodge. “When you pitch a script, you’re always asked: ‘What’s relevant about this? Why should we make it now?’ And with The Ipcress File, there was a fear that this stuff was so long ago. Our line was actually always that, in the cold war, people were very much aware of the threat of nuclear annihilation but it hasn’t gone away because of the number of warheads and rogue players and so on. But it feels terrible to be proved right.” As Hodge’s Oscar-nominated script for Danny Boyle’s 1996 movie Trainspotting was on screen within three years of Irvine Welsh’s novel, and his adaptation of Alex Garland’s The Beach in 2000 appeared just four years after the hardback, Deighton’s 1962 novel is by far the oldest source material Hodge has ever brought to our screens – and the first that has already been a movie. His version of The Ipcress File, though, is very different from either the 1962 book or the 1965 Caine film about a kidnapped British nuclear scientist. The novel is a first-person narrative and the movie dominated by Palmer, but Hodge has “given voices to other characters. Six hours of TV demands huge amounts of story compared to a movie. You need more central characters.” The TV version spreads the action between the new Palmer, played by Joe Cole), British agent Jean (Lucy Boynton), her spymaster Dalby (Tom Hollander) and CIA agent Maddox (Ashley Thomas). The fact that an African American spy was plausible (though rare) at that time, when the English secret service was hideously white, also allows the series to achieve both historical realism and diversity: “It is a balance between being true to the era and writing something a modern audience can relate to.” Cole, after a clever bit of business with the thick black-framed spectacles that were Caine’s visual signature, takes the role in a new direction, helped by a new backstory featuring thrilling scenes in Berlin that Deighton never imagined. Hodge and director James Watkins (Black Mirror, McMafia) “felt we needed something to introduce Harry,” says Hodge. “I think in a movie you can just say here’s a spy and go along with him. But TV audiences need to know a bit more about the characters … so I wrote a sequence about how Harry got involved, rather unwillingly, in espionage.” In the 60s, the cockney boy confidently dining at the highest tables was seen as a symbol of England’s social evolution. But now, says Hodge, we see it differently. “This is set at a time when the next five British prime ministers [Wilson, Heath, Callaghan, Thatcher and Major] are going to be from state schools, and it feels, in that moment, that the Old Etonians are over. But obviously we now know that they weren’t.” Hodge has also done a lot of plot renovation. “I think Deighton lost interest in the plot halfway through the novel, and it’s a series of comic riffs after that.” He sees it as a story about the emergence of a modern culture in Britain, after the still literally and metaphorically rationed 1950s: flying to Rome or Paris seems impossibly glamorous, and exotic delicatessens offer unimaginable foodstuffs such as pomegranate. The show covers 1962 to 63, and older viewers and history students will delight in trying to anticipate how Hodge might bring in what he calls “high 60s moments” – the Cuban missile crisis, the Profumo sex scandal, the presidency of John F Kennedy: “One of the pleasures of writing recent historical fiction is that you can aim for these landmarks that some of the audience will be anticipating.” Deighton’s cheekily meritocratic spook has widely been seen as an anti-James Bond and, oddly, working on The Ipcress File was also post-007 for Hodge. He and Boyle (his director on Trainspotting, its sequel T2 and Shallow Grave) were employed on “Bond 25”, which subsequently became last year’s No Time to Die; they co-wrote a script before being sacked. “I think it was me they really wanted rid of, but Danny took the bullet, too,” says Hodge. Do non-disclosure agreements cover their departure? “No. Just decent British discretion!” At the time Hodge and Boyle learned they would not write another day, there were suggestions they had spooked the producers by pitching an incredibly subversive storyline. But the released movie contains a twist at least as dramatic, which seems to disprove the rumour they had gone too far. “My understanding was that that twist had been decided even before we came on board because Daniel Craig wanted it. I think, with us, it was that old cliche “creative differences”. It felt very dramatic at the time but it was just another bump in the road of the Bond franchise.” As Hodge says he is sparing with scene directions (“I don’t like to tell directors what to do”), I wonder about the spectacular action sequences in a Bond movie. Do you just write “the island rises into the air and explodes” and let them get on with it? “I kind of hoped that was the case, because in a big action movie, the action is worked out between the director and numerous departments. But for some reason, they want you to write the action. It’s the thing I hate doing most: ‘The car skids round the corner, bouncing off the kerb. Inside the car, Jack Wiley lights a cigarette’ etc. And you can only get it wrong: they either tell you it’s too expensive or say it’s too unambitious because a plane already flew through the Deptford Tunnel in Fast and Furious 7, or whatever.” Hodge still has his Bond script on a laptop. When he saw the movie, he found that “half a line” of his dialogue had survived. What is it? “Aaaargh, I can’t. It’s their film. I don’t want to seem like the guy who got paid and goes round telling stories about them.” He didn’t even tell his family what the half-line was. “Look, it’s the screenwriter’s life. If you’re lucky, you get a job, and sometimes that job doesn’t end well.” If this ITV show is successful, Hodge would like to adapt Deighton’s 1965 novel Billion Dollar Brain (also a film with Caine), which is about viral warfare, and which may also have reached an interesting moment for a remake. He does not, though, expect Trainspotting to become a trilogy. “I think that’s done. In that heady atmosphere of producing T2, we talked about coming back to it. But the second film was not as exciting as the first, and to me that was a reflection of the fact that life isn’t as exciting in your 40s and 50s as in your 20s. I was at peace with that. Any idea of getting the gang back together for more hijinks just feels misguided to me.” He and Boyle are “developing an idea for a feature film, which is quite an old-fashioned idea these days. And, like most writers in the UK at the moment, we’re trying to think of ideas we can pitch to a big streamer for a vast multiseason international show!” The Ipcress File starts on 6 March at 9pm on ITV.

3/4/2022,"Glasses are glamour’s last taboo. You can embrace silver-grey hair and be on the cover of Vogue, like Kristen McMenamy. Armpit hair with a party frock is cool, thanks to Julia Roberts and Miley Cyrus. At 84 and 76, Jane Fonda and Helen Mirren still reign on beauty billboards without having their crow’s feet airbrushed out.And yet, women are still expected to whip off their glasses when the cameras start flashing. Roberts, Fonda and Mirren all wear glasses off duty, but tend not to on camera. When Annie Leibovitz photographed Jill Biden for Vogue last year, the first lady wore glasses in a casual portrait used inside the magazine, but took them off for the cover. At the 2016 Oscars, the black spectacles Kate Winslet wore to present an award were nowhere to be seen on the red carpet. But this could be the year all that changes. The post-pandemic take-me-as-I-am look is lending the way we have always looked behind closed doors – hoodie, scrunchie, glasses rather than contacts – a newly acceptable vibe, at least on Zoom. Remember Meryl Streep in her lockdown robe and glasses, straining her cocktail shaker into her martini glass? A total mood. This year, Mirabel Madrigal in Encanto became the first bespectacled Disney princess.Meryl is 72; Mirabel is 15. Glasses are not just a getting-older thing, nor only a teen fad. At the mature end of the scale, the visibility of glasses has a lot to do with the visibility of older women. Midlife women have main character energy on screen these days, and since wearing glasses is often part of the narrative of getting older, spectacles come with that territory. From the first episode of Sex and the City sequel And Just Like That, the passing of time for Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte was marked by the fact that when they sat down to brunch, they took out their glasses to read the menu. In their real lives, too, women stay in the spotlight as they grow older and start wearing glasses. We’re used to Courteney Cox and Jennifer Aniston as de facto specs wearers – though neither wore them for last year’s Friends Reunion. The latest crop of supermodels – Kendall Jenner, Emily Ratajkowski, Hailey Bieber, both Gigi and Bella Hadid – are the first to be regularly seen in glasses. For a generation whose appearance is more ruthlessly curated and filtered than ever, this is not about a lack of effort. Authenticity is almost an Instagram filter in its own right. Adding specs to your selfies looks adorable, just like adding puppy ears or a flower crown. Millennials grew up with Harry Potter; generation Z with disposable contacts and laser eye surgery. Glasses are no longer seen as an unfortunate necessity, but a choice. On TikTok, last year’s cottagecore has been replaced by Dark Academia, which (your correspondent writes, adjusting her specs to squint at the screen) seems to be about reading Donna Tartt while wearing glasses and preppy clothes from Depop, and having lots of candles burning while you do your homework. Go figure.A lot of us, of all ages, have skin in this game. A survey last year by the College of Optometrists found that a third of British people believed their eyesight had deteriorated over the pandemic. The go-to parental warning of screens being bad for eyes is backed by recent research. The good news is that the harm may be reversible. The welcome twist is that glasses don’t have to feel like bad news any more.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Forget contacts – like going grey, wearing glasses can be empowering | Jess Cartner-Morley",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/04/forget-contacts-like-going-grey-wearing-glasses-can-be-empowering
3/4/2022,"At first glance, Gran Turismo 7 offers much the same experience as the original game did back in 1997: an idiosyncratically clean aesthetic, a focus on authentic handling and impossibly shiny cars that put any carwash to shame. There have been some tweaks under the hood, as you would expect, and one major alteration that will probably divide fans, but this 25-year-old motor is very much still running. One thing that hasn’t changed is Sony-owned developer Polyphony Digital’s synergistic mastery of PlayStation hardware. Gran Turismo has always been trotted out to demonstrate the true graphical potential of Sony’s consoles, and Gran Turismo 7 slips into its traditional role of technical showcase with ease on PlayStation 5. While it remains compatible with the PlayStation 4, on the newer machine this is a jaw-slackeningly beautiful game. Each vehicle is fettled in obsessive detail, down to the exact arrangement of reflective elements in an individual car’s headlights. The game also provides the best workout for the haptic trickery of the PS5’s DualSense controller yet. In a racing simulator, understanding the forces to which the car is subjected at any given moment is crucial, and GT7 turns this handheld collection of vibration motors and resistive triggers into a remarkably effective communication tool. The much anticipated car-collecting campaign mode returns after its absence in Gran Turismo Sport, and it’ll grab most of the headlines. But in a move that is likely to frustrate longstanding fans, it’s surprisingly different this time round. Instead of the other titles’ more freeform vehicle-purchasing exploration, your route through the early part of the game is tightly controlled and punctuated with educational mini-lectures on significant or enduring aspects of car culture. Series creator Kazunori Yamauchi evidently sees preservation of this culture as a solemn responsibility in a changing automotive landscape, something that’s clearly reflected in the charming yet slightly stuffy delivery of these history lessons. Less forgivably, earning money can be painfully slow, the occasional gift roulettes are comically miserly, and the most desirable cars are phenomenally expensive and often only fleetingly available as the in-game markets shift. The result is enormous longevity for those with the patience, but even then there’s the nagging sense that the entire economy is built to coerce players into spending real money to secure their favourites. Fortunately, the time you spend out on the track, whether alone or in the cleverly regulated multiplayer mode, is a pleasure. The handling model, the core of any racing sim, remains hugely engaging. The most profound additions to the driving experience are two features that are neither completely new nor particularly glamorous, but they are executed superlatively: the changing time of day and weather conditions, which are nothing less than a full-blown atmospheric simulation. Spotting your braking at the end of the Le Mans 24 Hour circuit’s infamous Mulsanne straight becomes an entirely different challenge as the sun gradually dips below the horizon, and even from a solely aesthetic perspective, it’s difficult not to feel utterly transported as you sweep towards Yokohama docks through the early morning mist, rays of the rising sun bouncing off the asphalt. Rather than the old binary of wet and dry races, certain circuits can evolve as the session progresses. If it’s damp but not actively raining, a visible drying line may appear as cars displace the standing water, but races just as often begin wet and get even wetter, offering up less grip as the asphalt becomes completely saturated. Arriving at an event with no idea of the conditions you will encounter, but being able to accurately read the road in front of you, extends the novelty of the already generous number of cars and circuits available. That said, neither of the two British circuits, Brands Hatch and Goodwood, support wet weather at all, which does beg the question: has Yamauchi ever visited the UK? It’s reassuring that despite ever-greater technical refinement, Gran Turismo’s unique, eccentric character remains intact. It’s present in the grab-bag mission mode, which handily demonstrates that a race between 17 brake horsepower Fiat 500s can be just as gripping as one between cars with 50 times that. It manifests most obviously in the utterly bemusing music rally mode, which has you hitting checkpoints to the strains of 80s pop relic Hooked on Classics. Keeping this distinctive spirit alive in the era of 4K and 60 frames a second, Gran Turismo 7 feels both fresh and comfortingly familiar.

3/4/2022,"The first day of the [Russian] invasion [of Ukraine] was my 15th wedding anniversary. We had planned a party with friends and had booked a table in a restaurant. But early morning, around 5am, my family – my wife and my 10-year-old son – were woken by Russian rockets flying over our house. The first thought was to grab everything we could and leave. But all the roads were blocked with traffic, and they were shelling us all the time. It was terrifying. So we went to a nearby underground car park and spent the whole day there. There were about 60 people there on the first day. It was cold, there was no heating and people were lying on the floor. Occasionally we dashed back to the apartment to get supplies – we live on the 14th floor and the elevator was still working – that first day we were eating things like cookies and crisps, anything you could grab in a second. We slept in the car park in our car. My son was in the back seat, my wife and I in the front, half sitting and half lying down. I am almost 2 metres (6ft 6in) tall so it wasn’t very comfortable. We tried to think about our anniversary – about the wonderful 15 years we had together, that we have a God-blessed 10-year-old son whom we love very much. But that first day – it was just about fear. Waking up in the car felt horrible, my back was aching like never before. In the morning the bombing was quiet – well, almost quiet. The meaning of the word “quiet” was changing – when you hear only two explosions, instead of 10. We went home and quickly ate porridge for breakfast. Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine. Write to your local MP This can be a way to lobby the British government to place further sanctions on the Russian government and its associates. You can get in touch with your local MP via email or post to their constituency address. Instructions on how to get in touch can be found on parliament.uk. Ukrainians are friendly people and we know almost all of our neighbours very well. So we started to organise getting food and water for those who couldn’t – filling up water bottles in the apartment, fetching food, making a space in the car park for women with children to feed and change them in privacy. We weighed up leaving, but the traffic was still very bad. And we were thinking maybe this madness would stop. That night we slept underground again. 26 February The third day some friends got sick from the cold in the car park and we decided to return to our apartment and try to live normally – take a shower, cook meals, give lessons to our son and get him playing online chess. We taped our windows. The elevator was no longer working. My son’s a very brave boy. He’s trying not to cry. He’s trying to help. But every time the siren sounds from outside the window, and we have to run downstairs to the shelter again, I can see he’s scared. But he doesn’t panic. That day I was standing with a neighbour outside in our yard. Suddenly we heard gunshots from automatic rifles close by. Later I read the news via Telegram that Russian troops were trying to infiltrate the city. It said they were liquidated. At the moment you hear gunfire, you’re not afraid – you don’t have time to be afraid, you just have to get your son to safety in the car park. The shock comes a little later, when you realise you could have been killed. Or worse, your wife and child could be killed and you survive. By Sunday, some of the small neighbourhood shops had opened again. This war has transformed our reality – an open shop or gas station felt like a return to normal life. But when you queue there’s a real possibility you may be killed. Inside the store, there were only a few supplies. But the shelves weren’t empty, thanks to previous customers, thinking about those still queueing. I shared the food between our family and other people in the car park. The numbers had now grown to about 150. I started to organise more supplies for everyone: food, water, toilet paper. That night in our apartment we phoned everyone to check they are safe. My wife and son slept in our bedroom, and I slept in my son’s room. His part of the building is closer to the siren. To make sure I hear it, I left the window open while I slept – well, you can’t really call it sleep. You just lie with your eyes closed. You sleep fully dressed next to a bag with documents and food. Everybody here is exhausted. On Monday some of the big stores in the city were open for a few hours. I took my car to fill up on supplies. I went alone and I stayed on speakerphone with my wife, and she continuously tracked my location from my phone. Every time I was stopped at a roadblock to get my documents checked, I asked our soldiers, “What do you need?” I brought them things like cigarettes and water. It’s my thanks to these people who defend us, defend Ukraine, standing 24/7 outside in the cold with no sleep. Ukraine is tiny compared with Russia and our army is much smaller. But the braveness of people here, and how they have shown they are ready to defend the country until the last breath, gives me hope. When I was driving back from getting gas on Tuesday, my wife phoned me. “We can see smoke coming from the Holocaust memorial complex,” she said. I was absolutely devastated. I am Jewish. My father is 83 and survived the Holocaust, which killed half my family. We went to the memorial very often because I wanted my son to know the history. My father has memories of running across a field to get away from bombs. Now, my son has to do the same, but it’s not Hitler, it’s Putin who is bombing us. I was completely shocked and depressed. It’s no secret that our president in Ukraine is a Jew. We all support our president, we are very proud of him. I know people in Russia. Half of them are not my friends any more. A couple of them tried to tell me it was us who started this war. I just blocked them; I don’t want to read the crap they are writing. Russian TV has washed their brains – as a friend told me, “it’s not TV, it’s radiation”. On Wednesday the Russians told us you better leave Kyiv. My wife and I were still thinking about whether to go. There were two things stopping us. First, her parents are in Chernihiv. We were desperately trying to get them out, out of that hell – so they could come with us. And second, I still wanted to help people here. I’m a very peaceful person. The only way I would fight is if they come to my home – I will defend my family. At this point, I was doing my best to help the people who defend us and those who need help. We realised if we decided to leave for western Europe, where we have family, we needed different clothes, not the skiing jackets and winter clothes we packed on the first day. As the elevator was still broken, I had to lug four suitcases up the stairs to the 14th floor, one by one. We finally made the decision to go. I was nervous, but after Putin’s conversation with Macron on Thursday, and hearing about his aim to control all of Ukraine, we now understood that he won’t stop until he ruins all this country. We were not prepared to live in Putin’s Russia. But mostly, the decision was about the safety of my son and wife. We didn’t want him to see the war any more, to wake up and be afraid of bombing and tanks. He was very sad about leaving without his grandparents. We didn’t want to leave them either, but we needed to take care of our son.",News/World news,"‘My son is brave, but he’s scared’: Kyiv father’s diary of first week of invasion",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/kyiv-diary-russia-ukraine-invasion-first-week
3/4/2022,"ABel Air mega mansion marketed as “America’s most expensive residence” sold in an bankruptcy auction on Thursday with a winning bid of $126m, a fraction of its reported original asking price of half a billion dollars. The 21-bedroom home – described as “twice as big as the White House” – has been derided as much as praised, making its sale a hotly anticipated event. The elite team of realtors behind the auction touted it as the ultimate dream estate but others called it a “giant white elephant” and “one of the ugliest homes I’ve ever seen”. The New York Post labeled it “the latest example of a hyped Los Angeles mega mansion that failed to perform”, and suggested its failure to meet the listing price meant that the city’s “cheeseball” taste in real estate might be starting to improve. With a final sale price of roughly $141m, which included the winning bid plus commissions and fees, the property did not even bring in half of its listing price of $295m. Developers and real estate agents had dubbed the property “The One”, and said a residence of its scale would never be built again in Los Angeles. The 100,000 sq foot hilltop mansion built over the last decade is surrounded on three sides by a large moat and has 360 degree views of Los Angeles, the mountains, and the Pacific Ocean. Its amenities include 42 full bathrooms and 7 half bathrooms, a nightclub, a private running track, a 40-seat movie screening room, a juice bar, a cigar lounge, a “philanthropy pavilion”, a 30-plus car garage with two car-display turntables, a 10,000-bottle wine cellar, and five pools and other “water features”, including a private pool to accompany the master bedroom. There is also a bowling alley, with four lanes. Despite its hefty price tag, the property comes with a host of issues. It has been mired in legal battles and bankruptcy proceedings, and its current auction, which is being overseen by a bankruptcy court, was postponed several times to try to attract more potential wealthy buyers. Of concern to those buyers, The One still does not have a certificate of occupancy, the final health and safety permit needed to certify that it’s ready for residents to actually move in, and it still needs some “finishing touches”, as one realtor put it, since its construction is not complete. The strikingly low price is most likely a result of the unfinished state of the property, and the amount of additional work that will be necessary “to get it into a condition where it can be occupied”, said Byron Moldo, a Los Angeles attorney specializing in bankruptcy law, and does not necessarily mean the era of the mega mansion is over. A court-appointed receiver had estimated the property needed at least $10m to fix problems such as cracked marble and water leakage, the Los Angeles Times reported. The prospect of dealing with a $141m fixer-upper “could have had a large impact in terms of perhaps limiting the number of interested buyers, and how much they’re prepared to pay”, Moldo said. While the identity of the buyer must be disclosed as part of the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, it might be a corporation or an LLC designed to shield the actual identity of the purchaser, he said. A bankruptcy court judge will review and approve the sale later this month. According to bankruptcy court records, the current debt on the property totals $191m, the Los Angeles Time reported. With a sale price tens of millions of dollars below that, some of the creditors who loaned money to build the mansion will probably get only partial repayment, and some may get nothing at all, Moldo said. The judge will also oversee disputes over who gets how much money from the property’s much-delayed sale. Niles Niami, the mansion developer who built The One, and described his aesthetic, simply, as “badass”, had floated increasingly desperate plans to avoid auctioning it off, the Los Angeles Times reported, including turning it into an events space for boxing matches and holographic appearances of dead celebrities such as Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston, and making a cryptocurrency called “The One Coin” backed by the value of the property. Niami did not immediately respond to attempts to contact him after the auction’s close. However divisive, the sale of The One is consistent with a pandemic-driven shift in the tastes of the super-rich, said Chad Roffers, the president of Concierge Auctions, which conducted the online sale. While the world’s wealthy have recently tended to favor smaller, well-placed apartments in major cities (the previous most expensive US home was a $238m for a New York City penthouse), the experience of “being in a lockdown” has seen demand for “really big” properties surge – a trend that harks back to the mega mansions of the early aughts. While in many promotional photographs The One resembles a giant, frigid airport terminal, real estate agents involved with the sale have said that, in person, the house is full of thoughtful touches and very livable. While the participants in the auction were anonymous to the public, Roffers, the president of the online auction house, said their clients typically fit a certain profile: “Their world is private jets that they own, or at least share,” he said. “Some people are into art, some people are into wine, some people are into cars, some people are into everything. We really identify a niche of people who are property collectors. They’re always on the lookout for a unique property.” Of his company’s roughly 8,000 verified private clients, he said, 267 are billionaires. For these types of clients, The One has an obvious appeal: “Just the sheer magnitude of it is attractive to the right person,” he said. The much-hyped online auction for The One played out against the backdrop of an escalating war in Ukraine, as Russian oligarchs faced new financial sanctions, and at least one saw his giant yacht seized by the French government. While the context of shelling in Ukraine and massive economic sanctions on Russia was “disturbing” and likely to be on everyone’s minds, Roffers said in advance of the auction that he did not think it would affect the bidding. There were thousands of documented billionaires across the world, he said, “and most of them are from somewhere other than that part of Europe”. But after months of debate and speculation, the auction for The One on Thursday evening played out in a sluggish fashion, with only four bidders in total. In the last half hour, when online auctions typically heat up, there was still almost no movement. Only in the final two minutes did the price move above $70m, as a dueling pair of anonymous bidders pushed the price slightly above $100m. The $141m final pricetag is not a record-breaking price for the sale of a residential property in the US, or even in California, where venture capitalist Marc Andreessen spent $177m last year on a Malibu estate, breaking a previous $165m California residential property record set by Jeff Bezos. It does break a record in a more technical category. The handful of bids on the property in the early days of the auction, which put its price at $70m, “already surpassed the highest US record for a property sold at auction”, Roffers said, which he said was $51m for a Beverly Hills mansion in 2021.",News/US news,Mega mansion flop: hyped LA home sells for less than half its $500m asking price,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/04/mega-mansion-los-angeles-real-estate
3/4/2022,"Brentford’s safety is in their own hands as they sit three points clear of the relegation zone. A win at Carrow Road and then at home to Burnley next week will do their hopes of staying up the power of good, and with Christian Eriksen, the ace up their sleeve, working his way back to full fitness, Thomas Frank must believe a second season in the Premier League is within reach, despite his team being winless since 2 January. For Dean Smith at Norwich, five points adrift of the last safe spot, the need for victory is even more pressing. He will see this game as winnable and, with Leeds away next week, there is a window of opportunity the Canaries need to take now.
