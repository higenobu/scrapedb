1/21/2022,"Onetime White House strategist Steve Bannon and former chief of staff Mark Meadows are in “deep doo-doo” now that the Supreme Court has ruled against former President Donald Trump’s claim of executive privilege to shield documents sought in the U.S. Capitol riot probe, warned law professor Neal Katyal. Bannon and Meadows have refused to testify before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress, claiming that they, too, were protected by the executive privilege shield Trump has claimed. Asked by MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell on Wednesday what they face now, Katyal quipped: “I think the technical legal term is deep doo-doo.” The court’s decision is a “real problem for them,” added Katyal, who was acting solicitor general in the Obama administration. “Remember that Steve Bannon has been indicted already for contempt for not giving these answers to Congress, so he’s facing criminal charges. Mark Meadows is on his way to the same thing. Both of their defenses to contempt is executive privilege, and the Supreme Court ... blew that out of the water,” Katyal added. “That means these two individuals really do have to talk to investigators in Congress” now. The decision also affects plans by others — including Trump’s former personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and lawyer John Eastman, who wrote the “coup memos” mapping a path to overturn the 2020 election — to cite executive privilege to dodge testimony before the House committee, Katyal noted. “It’s going to be very hard for ... the whole cast of characters to avoid having to testify,” Katyal said. “They can try other arguments, like the Fifth Amendment and so on,” but the court’s ruling is “a real nail in the coffin” for them. Even more significantly, it means the entire “Trump signature move” ― using executive privilege to hide documents and keep people from testifying in televised hearings in Congress, is “now decimated by the Supreme Court’s ruling,” he emphasized. Executive privilege has its place, he said. “What it’s not about is plotting a coup and overthrowing American democracy.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

1/21/2022,"By Maria Tsvetkova    MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian-backed separatists in east Ukraine would expect Russia's army to fight with them against Ukrainian government forces if Moscow follows through on a parliamentary proposal to recognise their independence, a pro-Kremlin lawmaker said on Thursday.    Alexander Borodai made the comment after 11 lawmakers proposed that parliament ask President Vladimir Putin to recognise https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/might-russia-recognise-independence-breakaway-east-ukraine-regions-2022-01-20 the independence of the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions.    Such a move would mark a major escalation by Russia after weeks of mounting tensions around Ukraine. A Russian military buildup and threatening rhetoric have stoked Western fears of a looming invasion, though Moscow denies any such plan.    Borodai, a former Donetsk political leader who is now a member of the Russian parliament, said the separatists would look to Russia to help them wrest control of parts of the territory they claim that are now held by Ukrainian forces.    ""In the event of (the republics) being recognised, a war will become a direct necessity,"" Borodai told Reuters.    ""Russia would have to take on some security responsibilities"" and defend the territories, he said, as it did after recognising the independence of two breakaway Georgian regions after a 2008 war between Russia and Georgia.    The separatists took control of a swathe of eastern Ukraine in 2014 in a conflict that continues to simmer and has killed 15,000 people, according to Kyiv. Ukraine has long accused Russia of having regular troops in the region, something Moscow denies.    Borodai, a lawmaker for the ruling, pro-Putin United Russia party, served as prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in east Ukraine at the height of the conflict in 2014. He now leads an organisation of war veterans.    Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday responded cautiously to the proposal on recognition, saying he could not comment until parliament had voted on it. The lawmakers behind it are from the Communist Party, which casts itself as an opposition force but actually often backs the Kremlin.    Two sources familiar with government discussions of the proposal told Reuters the idea of recognising the regions was being seriously considered.    But a source close to the separatist leadership said the likelihood of such a move was low because it could provoke punitive measures against Russia, potentially entailing serious economic damage.    Orysia Lutsevych, a Ukraine analyst at Chatham House think-tank in London, said recognition could create a legal pretext for a Russian invasion of Donbass to ""protect"" it from Ukraine.    She said it would be a ""clear step of escalation"" requiring a Western response in the form of sanctions against Russia or bolstering NATO forces on the alliance's eastern flank.    (Additional reporting by Anton Zverev and Mark Trevelyan, editing by Tom Balmforth, Mark Trevelyan, William Maclean) ",World/Reuters,Ukraine war necessary if Russia recognises breakaway regions - pro-Kremlin MP,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-war-necessary-russia-recognises-174949953.html
