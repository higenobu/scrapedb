5/2/2022,"The subject of nuclear weapons is being pushed into the foreground by Russian media and officials. Russia’s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, said that the risk of a global nuclear war is very real. This ominous warning came not from some deranged psychopath – like the ones who regularly demand Kyiv to be nuked on Russian state TV. These were the words of the top diplomat of the Russian Federation. In diplomatic parlance, Lavrov essentially admitted that their vaunted offensive in Donbas is stalling, the war is lost, and Russia has nothing to counter Western weapons pouring in Ukraine. Politically and militarily, Russia is backed into a corner. Since Putin can’t accept defeat, the Kremlin is indicating that nuclear weapons are on the table as its last resort in this war.

Even if Lavrov personally may not be eager to bring the end of days – being but a minister of the Russian state – his overlord is perfectly capable of and ready for the apocalypse. Lavrov merely broadcasts his master’s will. In any case, this was a perfectly serious statement. I’d say it’s on the same level as the infamous article “On the unity of Russian and Ukrainian peoples,” written by Putin last summer. In that text, the dictator made a plain commitment to destroying Ukraine as a political entity if it refuses to forego its sovereignty and get absorbed by Russia. Lavrov threatens the world with destruction, if it prevents Putin from annihilating Ukraine. Both him and Putin are dead serious. In my opinion, the international community should respond to these threats in a way that runs contrary to Putin’s expectations. After launching its mad, irrational, and barbaric invasion of Ukraine, Russia has revealed that it’s no longer a credible, rational actor in the international arena. World leaders realize that Russian nuclear threats are best taken seriously, because the failure to do so would be prohibitively expensive. After all, the continued existence of human civilization is at stake. One person is currently openly threatening to destroy our civilization if his ludicrous demands are not met. This is nuclear terrorism on a grand scale – it’s not just some major city like New York that’s at stake, it’s all of humanity. Read also:  Soviet identity is gone forever, but Putin doesn’t get it  Giving in to the terrorist’s demands is out of the question, it would only embolden him to make further demands, and inspire copycats. Sooner or later, the world will have to call his bluff at one red line or another, risking a global nuclear war. The only difference is that the longer we appease the terrorist, the more powerful he becomes, and the weaker and more demoralized the rest of the world will be. Appeasement is not an option. What’s left to do then? Any security service official can answer that: the only option available is to eliminate the terrorist, who is holding the whole planet hostage, trying to force us all to meet his political demands. Not unlike a hypothetical asteroid, hurtling to wards Earth, this is a global problem that demands a global solution.

The West has started to realize the scope of the threat, and the EU, G7, and NATO are all working together, hand-in-glove. They will be followed by China – another crucial center of the modern world. Not to mention that Russia is relegated to being China’s vassal now. Beijing is in a position to order Putin around. Being somewhat hostile to the United States, the CCP looked upon Putin very favorably. China’s President Xi Jinping gave Putin the green light to invade Ukraine only after the conclusion of the Beijing Olympics, and Russia obeyed. But despite favoring Russia over the United States, China isn’t looking forward to perishing in the fires of nuclear Armageddon for Putin’s obsession with Ukraine. I think Jinping told Putin: “Go ahead, capture Ukraine if you can, but no nukes – we definitely don’t need that.” China famously has the long-term perspective of becoming the primary economic, cultural, and scientific powerhouse of the planet. It has no ambition to transform into a radioactive wasteland – something Putin’s gamble is pushing them towards. That’s why, following Lavrov’s threat, China’s foreign ministry issued a rather harsh, by Chinese standards, statement: “No one wants WWIII. All sides must show restraint around the Ukrainian crisis and avoid escalating the conflict.” Beijing is signaling to Putin that Russia won’t receive financial, technological, or military aid from China. Not even sympathies. And without Chinese support, the proverbial Russian warship has but one course to follow. He brainwashed his populace into expecting a triumph, but as it turns out, it will be Ukraine parading its troops across Moscow. The problem is that Putin has no other way out. Nuclear war is all he thinks about now. That’s his only perceived salvation from a humiliating military defeat in Ukraine. Putin doesn’t know what to do next, so his finger is creeping towards the nuclear “button.” That’s why I’m certain that Chinese security service will soon join their Western counterparts in figuring out a way to neutralize the Russian dictator – if it hasn’t happened already. Everyone around the globe will be pooling their resources towards stopping Putin. After all, nuclear war must be averted.",World/The New Voice of Ukraine,"Putin is inching towards his nukes, threatening to annihilate the world if he fails to capture Ukraine, says foreign affairs expert",https://news.yahoo.com/putin-inching-towards-nukes-threatening-152000734.html
5/2/2022,"A rare video shows Russian soldiers under intense fire from Ukrainian forces in Mariupol. A Russian channel said it decided to share the video to demonstrate its troops' ""heroism."" Warning: The video contains graphic scenes of warfare that may be disturbing. A graphic video shows a Russian infantryman being shot by Ukrainian forces in the besieged port city of Mariupol. The video, posted on Telegram by the Russian channel Military Chronicle, shows close-quarter fighting involving a squad of about ten Russian troops running to take cover in the city's war-ravaged ruins while being targeted with rapid gunfire. One soldier can be seen being hit by a bullet and falling to the ground. Military Chronicle said the bullet hit an artery, and the wound was fatal. —Rob Lee (@RALee85) April 29, 2022 One of his fellow soldiers can be seen trying to drag his limp body away as shots continue to ring out. A Russian armored vehicle arrives at the scene at the end of the video, presumably to support the underfire soldiers. ""At first, we did not want to publish this video - it's hard to watch it,"" Military Chronicle wrote on Telegram alongside the video. ""But it was decided, nevertheless, that these shots are also important for the chronicle since the heroism of our guys who are fighting for a dead comrade is important."" No date for the firefight is given. While much footage recorded by drones destroying Russian armor has been published, this clip is one of the first to document frontline infantry battles. The channel claimed that the Russian soldier was shot by the Azov Regiment, a paramilitary force within the Ukrainian National Guard. The group has generated controversy for its ultra-nationalist ideology and has been previously accused by Russia of raping and torturing civilians in the Donbas region. However, the regiment has been hailed for its role in defending Mariupol from invading Russian forces. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made references to the group to justify its invasion of Ukraine as a so-called ""special military operation"" to ""de-Nazify Ukraine."" A Twitter user geo-located the video, and posted a comparison image of the undamaged streets before Russian attacks turned much of the site into rubble. —erich_auerbach (@zcjbrooker) April 29, 2022 For two months, Russian forces have been heavily and indiscriminately bombarding Mariupol with bombs and missiles. With a peacetime population of 440,000, the port city is of strategic value because of its proximity to Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. It has witnessed some of the most bitter fighting of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is estimated that 1,000 civilians, mainly women, and children, alongside 2,000 troops, are trapped underground in the sprawlingAzovstal steel plant, the Ukrainian's last stronghold in the city. Russian forces began carrying out renewed airstrikes on the plant earlier this week and attempted to storm it. President Putin had previously called on remaining Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and said Russia would guarantee them ""their lives and dignified treatment."" Major Serhiy Volyna, the commander of the remaining Ukrainian forces, previously told Insider's Mattathias Schwartz and Michael Fedynsky that the Ukrainian troops wouldn't lay down their arms. ""We're not even considering that possibility,"" Volyna said.

5/2/2022,"By Sheila Dang and Katie Paul (Reuters) -Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal sought to quell employee anger on Friday during a company-wide meeting where employees demanded answers to how managers planned to handle an anticipated mass exodus prompted by Elon Musk. The meeting comes after Musk, the Tesla chief executive who sealed a $44 billion deal to buy the social media company, repeatedly criticized Twitter's content moderation practices and a top executive responsible for setting speech and safety policies. At the internal town hall meeting, which was heard by Reuters, executives said the company would monitor staff attrition daily, but it was too soon to tell how the buyout deal with Musk would affect staff retention. Musk has pitched lenders on slashing board and executive salaries but exact cost cuts remain unclear, according to sources familiar with the matter. One source said Musk would not make decisions on job cuts until he assumes ownership of Twitter. ""I'm tired of hearing about shareholder value and fiduciary duty. What are your honest thoughts about the very high likelihood that many employees will not have jobs after the deal closes?"" one Twitter employee asked Agrawal, in a question read aloud during the meeting. Agrawal answered that Twitter has always cared about its employees and would continue to do so. ""I believe the future Twitter organization will continue to care about its impact on the world and its customers,"" he said. Executives said during the meeting that the employee attrition rate has not changed compared to the levels before the news of Musk's interest in buying the company. In recent days, Musk has tweeted criticism of Twitter's top lawyer, Vijaya Gadde, who is a Twitter veteran and widely-respected across Silicon Valley. Musk's attack triggered a barrage of online harassment targeting her. Employees also told executives they feared Musk's erratic behavior could destabilize Twitter's business, and hurt it financially as the company prepares to address the advertising world in a presentation next week in New York City. ""Do we have a strategy in the near-term on how to handle advertisers pulling investment,"" one employee asked. Sarah Personette, Twitter's chief customer officer, said the company was working to communicate frequently with advertisers and reassure them ""the way that we service our customers is not changing."" After the meeting, a Twitter employee told Reuters there was little trust in what executives had to say. ""The PR speak is not landing. They told us don't leak and do a job you are proud of, but there is no clear incentive for employees to do this,"" the employee told Reuters, noting that compensation for non-executive staffers is now capped because of the deal. Agrawal is estimated to receive $42 million if he were terminated within 12 months of a change in control at the social media company, according to research firm Equilar. During the meeting, Agrawal urged staff to expect change in the future under new leadership, and acknowledged that the company could have performed better over the years. ""Yes, we could have done things differently and better. I could have done things differently. I think about that a lot,"" he said. Twitter declined further comment.
