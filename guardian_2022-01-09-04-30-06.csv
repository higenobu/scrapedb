1/9/2022,"The much-anticipated African Cup of Nations football tournament opens today, hosted by Cameroon for the first time for 50 years.Yet behind the celebrations – slightly tempered by strict pandemic restrictions – are tensions from a security crisis spreading from anglophone regions, shaping daily life in Cameroon and potentially even the tournament.Authorities in the west African country have ramped up security, particularly in the capital, Yaoundé, and other host cities across five of Cameroon’s 10 regions – with the effect of securing the tournament and bringing the crisis into view.In Limbe, a peaceful coastal city where Mali, Tunisia, The Gambia and Mauritania will play group matches, an explosion near the city centre last Wednesday left six injured and destroyed property.Marinette Abah, 33, was returning home from evening prayers at the time.“We were home when we received a call that Marinette had been wounded in the explosion,” her brother Calvin Nang said. “We met her with blood all over her body.”A faction of the separatist Ambazonia movement claimed responsibility, and the wider movement, which has condemned the government in Yaoundé as a colonial administration, has pledged to disrupt the tournament.Tensions in the north-western and south-western anglophone regions boiled over in late 2016, when protests against marginalisation of the English language, by lawyers and teachers, were brutally put down by Cameroonian security forces.  It fuelled a rise in armed activities by separatist groups seeking independence for the English-speaking parts of Cameroon. The groups have been accused of several attacks and blasts, including against schools, escalating an education boycott that began in 2017, and depriving a generation of Cameroonian children of an education, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. Cameroonian security forces have been accused of human rights abuses against anglophones, especially in rural areas.Many anglophones in Cameroon accuse the government of marginalisation and of attempting to assimilate their education and legal systems into the dominant francophone system.A spokesperson for Samuel Eto’o, a hugely popular figure as one of Africa’s greatest ever footballers a former Afcon champion as well as Champions League and La Liga winner with Barcelona and now head of Cameroon’s football association, refused to be drawn on the security crisis, focusing instead on preparations for the tournament, including 30 new or renovated football stadiums and training pitches. n an interview last month Eto’o also condemned the attempt by European football authorities to again postpone the tournament.“If the Euros took place in the middle of the pandemic, with full stadiums in several cities in Europe and there was no problem, why wouldn’t Afcon be played in Cameroon?”Last month, the European Club Association wrote to its African counterpart, the Confederation of African Football informing them they did not intend to release African players for 2021 Afcon in Cameroon citing rising infections. For many in a football-loving nation, the tournament is a proud moment, where Cameroon start as underdogs behind favourites Algeria, Egypt and Senegal.For others in the English-speaking parts of Cameroon, the tournament is a sideshow to an ongoing crisis.Wilfred Taka, a student in Bamenda, one of the cities in the anglophone north-west, said abuses by security forces were a constant reality, as well as the activities of armed separatists.“So many people have left Bamenda and the north-west to safer towns. Many of the businesses have shut down. For the past five years, things have not been easy,” he said.“Hardly will the month go to an end before you will hear of killings and kidnappings.The tournament is a good thing for the country, but would it not have been better if they had focused on peace first? But they have not done that.”",Sport/Football,Cameroon’s pride at hosting African Cup of Nations tempered by separatist violence,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/08/cameroons-pride-at-hosting-african-cup-of-nations-tempered-by-separatist-violence
1/9/2022,"The pandemic has been a nightmare of subscriptions, verifications, registrations, activations and the resetting of long-forgotten passwords. But for me, the tipping point came late. After months of lockdown, I met some workmates in a beer garden. We checked in but the rules were that you couldn’t approach the bar. You had to order your drink from your table via an app.  Easy. Except that I was filling in the fields on a web form – email, phone number, address – just to get a $4 cranberry juice when I should have been enjoying the company of friends. Was my email address then available to marketers far and wide? Did I untick the right boxes? Who knows, but I’m sure it only added to the deluge of unwanted offers that greet me every morning when I open my inbox. So I’ve set up a throwaway email address, a place where all that stuff can be parked out of my sight. I use it for buying tickets, booking restaurants, making inquiries, ordering stuff online and for non-work Zoom meetings (like book chats). Think of it like junk mail for things that aren’t entirely junk. The emails won’t pollute your main inbox and there’s no pressure to spend time deleting them. I wish I’d done this 10 years ago. It would have been great for signing up to streaming services – Netflix, Spotify, SBS On Demand – but so much of my life is already signed up. Starting a throwaway email address is simple. Just create a new email account. Gmail is easy to set up and next-to-bottomless with its free 15 gigabytes of storage. If you want to go a little further off-grid, there are various “burner” email services in which you can set up accounts that self-erase after a few hours or days. I don’t have anything I need to hide that badly. So far, my throwaway account is happily catching tickets I need to print out later. It doesn’t have spam emails – yet. But when it does, at least it’s all in the one sinkhole that I never need to clean up.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Easy wins: start a throwaway email – ‘I wish I’d done this 10 years ago’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/09/easy-wins-start-a-throwaway-email-i-wish-id-done-this-10-years-ago
1/9/2022,"Queensland’s huge untapped Galilee coal basin was touted as a jobs and revenue bonanza by its supporters, with the potential to liberate hundreds of millions of tonnes of harmful greenhouse gases. The Galilee’s potential as a “carbon bomb” was wrapped up in a dozen or more coalmining projects and estimates of billions of dollars of investment.  So far, just one project has made it through the starting gate – Adani’s controversial Carmichael mine, which sent its first coal to port late last year. The mine was supposed to be the first of many. Yet there is little sign of more coal to come, with many projects shelved, lapsed or discontinued, and uncertain futures for those that remain. “There was genuine hope, and house and land prices skyrocketed,” says Sean Dillon, the mayor of Barcaldine regional council, which covers several small towns including Alpha, Barcaldine, Aramac and Jericho in the basin. Dillon says communities have become jaded by the promises of jobs and income. “Everything was on the cusp and then it just got mothballed. It’s left a few communities scratching their heads,” he says. Dillon’s own cattle station property north of Alpha sits over one of the proposed mines, known as Kevin’s Corner. That tenement, along with two others, was sold in 2011 by Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting for a reported $1.2bn to the Indian conglomerate GVK. Dillon says his understanding is that project is now “completely dormant”. The broader failure of many of the mines to materialise is down to “geography and workforce”. All the mines are greenfield sites – largely undeveloped land still covered in scrub or fields – with high costs to develop the infrastructure needed. He says most people in the region are not opposed to new coalmines, but there’s a desire for diversification of an economy that’s dominated by agriculture. A state government-backed plan for a renewable energy precinct in the region has “got people excited”, he says. “These non-traditional jobs … people are not against them, but they are just more familiar with resource extraction jobs. But they are keen to see some alternative options.” The one project that has got off the ground, Adani’s Carmichael mine, still retains approvals to mine up to 60m tonnes of coal a year for export to power stations. But the company has said the project is currently downscaled to a 10m-tonne-a-year operation. In the early 2010s, the Queensland government passed environmental approvals for six mines in the Galilee – including Carmichael – with more than 15,000 operational jobs claimed across the projects. By 2014, a government-backed assessment of the basin’s coal identified four mines that had gained initial approval, two more going through environmental approvals and a further seven considered at much earlier stages of development. Earlier reports from environment groups and others identified nine of those projects as “megamines” which, if they gained approvals and were at full production, would produce 330m tonnes of coal a year. When burned, all that coal would emit 857m tonnes of CO2 a year, according to a report from Climate Analytics. But slowly the projects – and the jobs claims – have fallen away. The Degulla mine had an estimated 35m tonnes of coal a year waiting to be dug. But in 2013 its Brazil-based owner Vale, one of the world’s biggest miners, put the project on the market. Vale announced last year it was getting out of coal altogether and told the Guardian this week it still has “exploration tenements in the [Galilee] region that are in [the] process of divestment”. The Chinese-owned Macmines Austasia abandoned its bid for a mining lease for its $6.7bn China Stone mine in 2019. A state environmental assessment for another mine, the South Galilee Coal project, lapsed in late 2019. The project’s part-owner had already gone into administration and there’s little sign of action from the mine’s American investor. Hancock Prospecting has interests in two mines and Clive Palmer’s Waratah Coal also has two mine projects identified. Market analysts S&P Global said in a bulletin in December there was “yet to be any commitment registered for these projects”. Palmer’s Galilee Coal project – once known as the China First mine – is linked to his company’s plans to build a power station in the Barcaldine region. Those plans, submitted to the Barcaldine regional council, were called in by the state government in December. Hancock Prospecting and Waratah Coal did not respond to a request for response. The Queensland Resources Council said no one was available to speak before deadline. Tim Buckley, an energy market analyst at the pro-renewables Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, says when the Galilee projects were proposed, they threatened to become “a climate bomb that was unparalleled”. “All but one didn’t even get out of the starting blocks and I think none will,” he says. Buckley says the entire economic rationale for coal has changed since the projects were announced. “A decade ago it was about catering for a growth in demand in energy across Asia,” he says. “But now it is about decarbonisation. It is accepted now that coal is on a slow but terminal decline. The world is completely different now.” A December report from the Office of the Chief Economist noted 37 coal projects in Australia at the feasibility stage, but many were delayed. There was a growing preference for expansions of brownfield sites – previously utilised land – over greenfield investments, the report said, with “an expanding list of lenders/investors who have withdrawn from financing new thermal coal projects”. Buckley says: “Everyone today that still loves coal sees it as cheaper to buy stranded assets that exist rather than go for greenfield projects.” The Queensland government is working on a development plan for the resources industry. A draft says that the global market for thermal coal “is likely to decline as countries choose their own path to reduced emissions” but there could still be pockets of growth. “Queensland’s high-quality thermal coal deposits mean that we are well placed to respond to these opportunities, while continuing to support the coal industry to decarbonise and remain competitive for longer,” the draft says. In a statement, the Queensland resources minister, Scott Stewart, said the “development of any specific project is a matter for the relevant company”. He said the government had “long held the position that we support resources projects which stack up financially, environmentally and socially”. Stewart said the plan would look at “taking advantage of the worldwide demand for new economy minerals which are critical as part of clean energy technology like batteries and renewables”.",News/Australia news,After Adani: whatever happened to Queensland’s Galilee basin coal boom?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/09/after-adani-whatever-happened-to-queenslands-galilee-basin-coal-boom
1/9/2022,"Recently, I was doing night shift in an emergency department and every single patient I treated tested positive for Covid. But that was not the reason they had presented to hospital. It was routine testing that picked up their infection. This is the reality of working in an Australian emergency department over the last month. This week it has become especially stressful as the volume of Covid-positive presentations has increased – at least two-to-fourfold. The staff on whom it places strain include cleaners, nurses, administration workers and doctors.  Covid-19 has added a new dimension to all emergency departments in Australia. The advent of the Omicron/Delta wave of late 2021-22 has put immense strain on these sections of the health workforce due to sheer patient load. Although inpatient hospitalisations and ICU Covid-19 numbers have only begun to rise (these are people with moderate to severe Covid, who mostly require constant oxygen therapy as a minimum), these numbers mask the hundreds of patients presenting to emergency departments across Australia who are positive on an RAT or a PCR test. Unfortunately, due to the insane virulence of Covid Omicron, a large proportion of Australians is becoming infected very quickly and even though a small proportion of those infected will require hospitalisation, that number of patients on top of a consistent 95-99% bed capacity of most health organisations puts the hospital at breaking point. I have witnessed these added presentations breaking the souls of many healthcare workers who cannot deal with the stress. The increase in patient loads these health services are experiencing has led to patients waiting a long time and health services requesting patients with mild Covid or seeking a Covid RAT or PCR not to attend an ED as they will be turned away. This breaks my heart. Most will be fine and survive (albeit the clinical studies surrounding long Covid do not make for comforting reading) but there are some unlucky few who will deteriorate, require ICU care and may die. We are now two years into the Covid-19 pandemic: from flattening the curve, to lockdowns, to a Covid-free summer, to vaccines plus boosters, to RAT shortages, and finally to living with Covid. We have all lived through these phases but the reality for the burned-out healthcare worker has not changed. We are still donning and doffing PPE constantly, we are testing, crying, covering extra shifts, considering quitting, restricted from taking annual leave, stepping outside our comfort zone, breaking bad news, speaking with families by phone rather than face to face, and hoping it all goes away – all the while knowing that Covid is now the new normal. It’s not just ICU bed numbers that demonstrate the extra burden Covid-19 adds to the healthcare system, despite what some politicians and commentators would like you to believe. It’s the sheer number of patients with confirmed or suspected Covid at the moment. This gives an additional layer of complexity that must be considered by every health worker on top of often already medically and socially complex patient presentations. Alongside this, it’s the constant concern by health workers that they will pick up the virus at work and pass it on to their child, elderly parents, pregnant partner, immunocompromised friend. We are now seeing significant numbers of colleagues isolating due to being sick and this is all escalating to a point where healthcare workers, particularly in Victoria, are exhausted from two years of these worries. It has become normal to speak to a colleague at work who has made plans to move from emergency departments to work that allows them to have time away from the constant pressure the health system is under. It is unfortunately also not uncommon to find distressed colleagues at work. The most important thing I want to convey is that it’s not Covid that’s broken our health system. It’s decades of a broken health system, run by overworked, exhausted and often underpaid people. The solution to most of these issues is structural governance reform at both state and federal levels. Our healthcare system is a precious resource and one of which many who work in it in Australia are proud. The Covid-19 crisis we are experiencing now puts this system at major risk and along with it the health of all Australians.

1/9/2022,"We’re standing on sand dunes at the end of a hot December day. The light’s fading fast and a thin crescent moon is rising in the clear sky. It’s still really hot; hot enough to dip in the ocean. But nobody does – not because it’s stinger season now, but because we’re here for something better. Here on Magnetic Island in Queensland, everyone’s a volunteer and everyone’s local except me. There are kids in school uniform, parents who’ve come from work, a retiree, a CSIRO scientist, a marine biologist called Paul, and an off-duty park ranger. We take turns peering into a blue plastic bucket. Now it’s my turn. Inside is a batch of freshly hatched green sea turtles. Their easy exit from an underground nest was blocked by vegetation, so these volunteers have dug them free.  Paul pulls one out and it wriggles between his hands, so tiny and lively. The next moment, it’s hurtling down the thick golden sand of the beach with its brothers and sisters, towards the gently lapping waves. People are releasing them one by one. The baby turtles move so fast they might take off and fly like whirring cicadas, instead of entering the sea. There are oohs and aahs and clapping and lots of smiles as each hatchling dives down and disappears. We wait a while, carefully watching the water’s edge, hoping they’re all safely on their way. Later, Paul tells me each of these green turtles has just a one-in-a-thousand chance of surviving to maturity. Now, we’re focused on just one of these – it’s washed back up, tried to swim again and failed, and has run out of puff. It goes back in the bucket, which I hold carefully on my lap as we drive to the hospital established and maintained by a larger group of volunteers, the Magnetic Island Network for Turtles. If this runt of the litter survives the night, it will get a revival injection and hopefully stand a chance. Nearby are adult turtles well into recovery. One is decades old and moves slowly; it came in with an impossibly mangled shell, maybe bitten by a shark. Another’s younger and friskier – it was rescued with “floating syndrome”, caused by a gas build-up after a turtle ingests marine debris such as plastic, which stops food being properly absorbed. This turtle splashes and bangs excitably against the walls of its circular tank, and pokes its nose inquisitively above the water in my direction after sizing me up. Another survivor now seems to be practising a healthier kind of floating. It completely ignores me, makes balletic arcs with its flippers, and is a lot more zen. I’d recently flown from Tasmania to Queensland, years after a memorable and moving encounter with a cheeky turtle while swimming in a coral canyon on the Great Barrier Reef. This time I headed to Magnetic Island, my visit starting with a day trip back to the reef. For a few hours, we sped away from the island, on a boat that had suspended operations when Queensland’s tourist industry was smashed by Covid border restrictions. This was its test voyage just ahead of the 2021-22 summer season. We were a random mix of locals from the island and nearby Townsville, interstate visitors like me taking advantage of the quiet before the storm of imminent border openings, and international travellers stuck in Australia since we closed to the world in March 2020. So there I landed – suddenly snorkelling with a 20-something exile from Salzburg in a remarkable open aquarium. It was wondrous, floating in these warmest of seas with those tropical fish in sparkling schools and seductive pairs, and that amazing blue-and-peach-coloured coral beneath us. But part of my heart couldn’t help sinking – where’s that turtle? The next day, I walked for hours in the baking heat with borrowed snorkelling gear and a stinger suit, through the national park on the island and its sleeping clusters of koalas, to beaches to which the road’s now closed. First stop was a bay ringed by hoop pines and renowned for turtles. The spectacular beach was empty. I sat in the shadow of granite boulders and ate my packed lunch, then set out swimming to the closer reef. As I moved towards a party boat nearby, now motoring back to sea, someone shrieked – “WE JUST SAW A GIANT TURTLE!” I guessed they did, but it swam away, and the engine noise meant I wouldn’t find it anytime soon. So I kept walking to other beaches. Eventually I landed at Radical Bay, where I now know in the 1980s there was a resort with a disco playing until dawn, which isn’t there any more. It is wild land earmarked for a luxury property development that now seems to have failed. Conservationists still hope to buy it back for those elusive koalas and, I hope, visitors like me who want to float away gently from our daily lives to find something very much better – like majestic sea turtles. I didn’t get to meet any turtles face-to-face in the seas near Radical Bay that day. But I hope to return sometime soon and try my luck again. Meanwhile, I’m left with a special new memory: the sweet surprise of encountering that squirming hatchling – rescued in a bucket – which might have lived until morning.",Lifestyle/Travel,‘We take turns peering into a plastic bucket.

1/9/2022,"Karekare is a wild, beautiful area of the Waitakeres, west of Auckland. It’s the place I dreamed about when I lived in London, the landscape I yearned to return to. It was the location of my most intense experiences as a child: fear, euphoria, exhilaration, joy. Our parents’ bach was built on a hillside with a view down the valley, surrounded by dense bush in all directions. There was always the risk that if we went too far off a track, even close to the house, we’d quickly get disorientated and lost. The bush was so thick you couldn’t get a clear view out of it, and the only way to escape was by standing still and shouting.  At the bottom of Lone Kauri Road was Karekare Beach (the beach in the movie The Piano), a glittering expanse of black sand and dunes ending in lines of rolling surf that roared ceaselessly, the sound echoing against the cliffs. On hot afternoons the air rippled with heatwaves that made mirages appear like puddles of mercury shimmering over the black sand. I was exhilarated by the hard light, the sky and the big surf. One year after a summer storm, when the sea was wild and whipped into massive swells by the offshore wind, and it happened to be dead low tide, the point when the surf is rolling over shallow water and, near the shore, the waves are breaking on hard sand, a wave picked up my father and dashed him down on his head, fracturing a vertebra in his neck. He was rescued by lifeguards and helicoptered to hospital, lucky not to have been paralysed and drowned. Karekare is a landscape always in wild motion: the boiling surf, the wind, the dancing glare off the dunes. The sand itself is a hazard in summer; its blackness absorbs heat, and if you get caught on a stretch of it without shoes you can suffer serious burns. One holiday our parents allowed me, my brother and a family friend to tramp alone into the Pararaha Gorge. We entered a wilderness of dense bush, sign-posted as a day-long hike “for experienced trampers only”, with no proper track, which ended in a remote coastal walk around surf-lashed rocks that could only be safely negotiated at low tide. My brother was ten, I was seven, the friend was five. Once we’d got a certain way in, the track disappeared, and we spent the next hours trying to find it, following false trails and sheep tracks that petered out halfway up cliffs. We realised we were lost, and that by now we couldn’t go back even if we wanted to, because the bluffs and waterfalls we’d climbed around were too hard, especially for a five-year-old, to scale. We had to deal with the dangerous, fast-flowing white-water river, steep cliffs and tangled bush for the whole day until we were found. It was only after a long period of trying to find a track and following trails that led us to dangerous places and dead ends that we understood we should just follow the river itself. I remember intense fear and despair, the hours of terrified crying as we tried to find our way, and the objectively correct understanding that we could die. We got stuck on steep bluffs, we struggled with the five-year-old trying to climb around waterfalls, we had to swim, climb and fight our way through the stark, unforgiving landscape. But I went on loving the wild, exhilaratingly beautiful place, and I’ve always returned to it, despite the terror of that day. Charlotte Grimshaw is an Auckland novelist.

1/9/2022,"Conservatives look like cranks today, not because of personal failings of this or that politician, but because they cannot deal with the crises of the modern world. It’s not that they don’t have answers – rightwing thinkers spit them out faster than a machine gun fires bullets. It’s just that their answers are irrelevant and, even in Tory terms, self-defeating. All viable responses to global warming, vaccination, the job losses artificial intelligence will bring and failing public health enhance the role of the state. It must provide jobs and benefits to society’s losers, protect their health and drastically reconfigure markets to sustain the planet. Small states that allow sovereign individuals and companies to decide for themselves now feel as antiquated as Margaret Thatcher’s handbag and pearls.  At best, Conservatives will the ends but not the means, as the Johnson government does with the climate crisis and protecting the NHS from the Covid pandemic. At worst, they retreat from modernity into denial and conspiratorial gibberish. I know of no better example of the inability of the right to face the world in front of its eyes than the collapse in public health, which will become ever more visible as 2022 progresses. Inflation and tax rises are pushing a great segment of the population into poverty or a place close to it. In ways that would astonish our forebears, poverty will produce obesity. Anyone in the government who has cared to study the crisis knows that the cheapest meals are no longer vegetables and rice, potatoes or bread, the traditional diet of the poor. Now, they are ultra-processed industrial foods, whose manufacturers use the cheapest and least nutritious ingredients and economies of scale to keep the price as low as possible and lashings of fat, sugar or salt to make their gunk palatable. Government knows it, but will do next to nothing about it. Tim Lang, the author of Feeding Britain, refers me to studies showing the UK had the worst diet in Europe, with half of all food bought processed to the nth degree. The result is hundreds of thousands suffering avoidable deaths or years of painful and cramped lives as they deal with the chronic illnesses fatness brings: cancer, heart disease, strokes, dementia and, indeed, Covid. The moral argument for preventing needless pain is overwhelming. Even the most hard-hearted Tories, meanwhile, should want to limit the escalating costs of healthcare if only to hold on to their money. The NHS spends £18bn a year treating obesity-related conditions, a figure that can only rise. Dreadful diets mean higher taxes. They cannot bring themselves to act, just as they cannot bring themselves to tell the UK’s Novak Djokovices that there is a price to pay for refusing to be vaccinated or level with the public on the revolutionary changes to national life a serious attempt to cope with climate change will bring. The best the Conservatives could manage was to commission Henry Dimbleby to produce a national food strategy. Last summer, it recommended the government intervene to produce a long-term shift in eating habits, that sugar and salt be regarded as modern versions of tobacco and taxed accordingly, and that the government protect food standards in trade agreements. The report was criticised for treating food poverty as a distinct condition. Our own Jay Rayner, the Robespierre of radical restaurant critics, roared there is no such thing as food poverty, there’s only poverty. The best way to deal with today’s fall in living standards is to listen to Marcus Rashford and restore the cuts to universal credit. Dimbleby is indeed a classic establishment figure: fathered by David, schooled by Eton. But that is what makes him interesting. He offered Tories the chance to modify rather than overthrow their beliefs. Throughout its history, the Conservative party has survived by making concessions to shifting times the better to ensure that it stayed in control of change. “Tory men, Whig measures”, as Disraeli put it. Now it cannot adapt or concede. Ministers have sat on the Dimbleby report for months. In cabinet, all the familiar arguments are heard against, in that tellingly upper-class phrase, the “nanny state” interfering with free markets and freedom of choice. Civil servants are muttering that better health labelling on food products is as far as their political masters will go. Readers may scoff at Conservatives babbling about nannies. But there is a long tradition of leftwingers worrying about the middle classes telling the working classes what to do. “The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots,” wrote George Orwell in 1936. “When you are underfed, harassed, bored and miserable, you don’t want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit ‘tasty’.” In other words, it’s not that worries are not justified. It’s just that they provide no solutions. History isn’t an exam. No teacher rewards the students who get the questions right. Maybe Conservative politicians can prosper by riding the reaction against the costs of the push towards net zero. Donald Trump has already shown them the way. But whatever electoral success they continue to enjoy, Conservatives can see the world Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan created collapsing. They fear a prim and constricted future when the state represses enterprise, tells you what to eat, how often you can fly, when to be vaccinated, how you must heat your home and what type of car you can drive, if any. But then, when the current wave of conservatism began in the 1980s, leftwing critics saw how it would lead to a corrupt and divided future. If Thatcher wins, said Neil Kinnock, in 1983, “I warn you not to be ordinary, I warn you not to be young, I warn you not to fall ill, I warn you not to get old”. His oratory and foresight did the Labour party no good because the left no longer seemed to have credible solutions. Now it is Conservatives who cannot respond to change. The 21st century baffles them. They don’t know what to do about it. This is why, for all their apparent self-confidence, so many speeches by Conservative politicians and articles by Conservative thinkers sound more than a little unhinged.

1/9/2022,"One of Victoria’s largest public hospitals, the Alfred, predicts as many as 15% of its staff may be unavailable because of Covid with the Omicron wave expected to last for up to another eight weeks. Staff at the hospital, which includes Australia’s largest intensive care unit, were told in an email on Friday from the chief executive, Andrew Way, to prepare for rising demand just as the available workforce was decreasing. The Alfred now has more than 50 patients in ICU, or about twice the next largest hospital in Victoria.  “This week, approximately 7% of our workforce was confirmed Covid-positive and many others are furloughed due to household exposures,” Way said in the email. “With the current wave expected to run for another 6-8 weeks, we expect 10-15% of our staff to be unavailable to work at its peak.” Way requested that all “patient-facing staff” postpone leave scheduled from now until late February. “Over the next 6 weeks we need as many of our patient-facing staff who can work to do so, supporting colleagues and patients through this wave,” he said. The email came as Victoria reported on Saturday a record 51,356 new Covid cases although health authorities said almost half (26,428) were rapid antigen tests (RAT). Many of those were taken earlier in the week. All states bar Western Australia are posting big increases in Covid cases. New South Wales hospitals are bracing for a tripling of Covid patients within weeks that will likely challenge their capacity. Within the Alfred, though, staff are already concerned that care is being compromised. “The quality of care being delivered is suboptimal – no fault of any staff – we are just told to ensure vitals stable, medicate and move on, leaving a lot of vulnerable patients neglected,” one staffer told Guardian Australia. “It’s also like a game of Russian roulette with potentially [Covid-] positive staff members and at-risk patients [mixing],” said the staffer, who was not authorised to speak publicly. “The self-surveillance staff Covid tests are almost 4 to 5 days behind.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A whole range of patients were exposed. “[It’s] essentially a death sentence if they catch it off us,” the person said. “There’s no RAT tests for us to exclude ourselves prior to starting shift or even coming to the hospital. We just find out when we are on the ward or have worked multiple shifts infecting patients and staff alike.” Recent graduate and first-year nurses were also performing work normally reserved for those with at least two years’ experience. “Beforehand graduate nurses were not even allowed to check medications with other graduate nurses,” the staffer said. “Now we are so short-staffed they are checking dangerous medications on their own.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app A separate email to some Alfred staff on Wednesday stated “all clinical areas in Alfred Health are reducing [nurse-patient] ratios”. “Please be mindful and support each other to do the best you can do,” the manager said. “We know that things will get missed and you might not be able to do or achieve everything you want to do. “What’s most important right now is to look after each other to do the best we can with what we have,” the manager said.

1/9/2022,"Crisis? What crisis? It was good to see the prime minister kicking back at the cricket on Friday. Sends the right message.  Life goes on. The Poms are being hammered. How good?! Another message was being sent by the nursing unit manager at Brisbane’s QEII Jubilee hospital. With 100 staff rendered unavailable by the outbreak, the manager’s advice to those remaining was to “Prioritise tasks…cry…whatever you need.” In Queensland, some 2,000 healthcare staff are unable to work. “This is like a crisis we’ve never seen before,” said Beth Mohle of the Queensland Nurses and Midwives Union. A view echoed by the Australian Medical Association’s Dr Maria Boulton: “We are in a crisis at the moment; the entire health care system is mobilising.” And that’s just Queensland. And that’s just now. New South Wales is running at more than 40,000 new cases a day. Those are official numbers, unlikely to capture the true extent of the spread – and even then they far surpass what seemed like alarmist warnings less than a month ago from the health minister, Brad Hazzard. Then, he spoke of 25,000 daily cases by the end of the January. When the prime minister emerged from Wednesday’s national cabinet declaring schools would “go back and stay back (from) day one of term one”, it took just two days for that plan to crumble. By Friday, Queensland’s Annastacia Palaszczuk was acknowledging low levels of immunisation among five- to 11-year-olds. “We will not be sending primary school students back during the first week of school if we are heading towards a peak,” she said, foreshadowing further discussions at national cabinet level. If teacher numbers are winnowed like nurses and truckies, it’s not clear how schools can stay open, let alone deliver normal classes. Last October, Scott Morrison’s lamentations over the departure of premier Gladys Berejiklian were eased by the thought of her successor. Dominic Perrottet’s instincts were always strongly towards the “let it rip” school on Covid, views that aligned with the PM. “A strong society needs a strong economy,” said Perrottet in his first speech as premier. He cited “opening up the economy” as a priority. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In mid-December, with Omicron already spreading and chief health officer Kerry Chant glowering behind him, Perrottet announced the dropping of mask and QR-code mandates outside “high-risk settings.” In hindsight, it seems nuts. Even at the time, epidemiology professor Adrian Esterman declared: “It simply makes no sense.” And then a weird thing happened. After the initial, expected rush back to bars and restaurants, Sydney folk went into swift retreat. “Diners are spooked,” reported an ANZ Research paper this week. Nationally, consumer spending “is now at its worst since (the) Delta lockdowns”. And the capital of the “let’s live with Covid” approach has been worst hit of all. “Sydney spending for the week to 5 Jan was at its weakest since Covid began”, says the ANZ paper. “Caution about Omicron transmission and disruptions of businesses due to staff shortages are central to the decline.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Workers who are sick or in forced isolation have disrupted supply chains so that supermarket shelves, especially for meat, fruit and vegetables, are increasingly bare. None of it is a surprise to economist Prof Jim Stanford. “The idea that letting it rip – you know, taking a deep breath and puffing up our chest and just facing Covid head-on – would somehow be good for the economy, was always nonsense,” he said in a widely shared tweet. “You can’t run a healthy economy without healthy people.” Faced with modelling showing NSW could find itself with barely a hospital bed to spare, in ICU or in general wards, by the end of January, at least a partial policy backflip was inevitable. Perrottet says new bans will be enforced on singing and dancing in pubs and clubs. People have been asked to “minimise mingling”. Non-urgent elective surgery will also be “paused”, to the frustration of many specialists. “This is not just cosmetic surgery or minimal surgeries,” says Prof Jeff Dunn of the Prostate Cancer Foundation. “These are potentially life-saving or diagnostic surgeries.” The modelling suggests the Omicron wave will begin to fall by mid-February. By the expected federal election in May, might the crisis be where Scott Morrison most wants to see it – in his beloved “rear-view mirror”? Troy Bilsborough from the strategic consultancy Provocate is not so sure. A former health media adviser in the Abbott and Turnbull governments, Bilsborough says Covid is no longer a “theoretical” threat. On official figures some 800,000 Australians have caught it. “Realistically, it is probably double that; it is probably up to 2 million,” says Bilsborough. By the time people vote, he says, “you’re looking at another few million people”. Long Covid will be a lived experience for some. People will question if the government did enough to protect them. He predicts difficult new issues in industrial relations as workers seek clarity over time off for chronic symptoms. His “gut feeling” is that the government might have been better placed “if they had kept a lid on the cases”. Too late now. But on the upside, we’re thrashing those Poms at the cricket.",Opinion/Opinion,"Too late now, but ‘let it rip’ might prove tricky for Scott Morrison come election time | Hugh Riminton",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/09/too-late-now-but-let-it-rip-might-prove-tricky-for-scott-morrison-come-election-time
1/9/2022,"It might be an imaginary character straight out of a Dr Seuss book: The goldfish who could drive. But it’s real. Incredibly, Israeli researchers created a robotic car and report that they taught six fish – named after characters from Pride and Prejudice – to navigate it on land. It’s all in the name of science, of course. The team had been dreaming up ways to test fish navigation for a while, according to Shachar Givon from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, first author of a study published in the journal Behavioural Brain Research.  “Recently, we even ventured out to the coral reef of Eilat in an ongoing attempt to study navigation on a larger, more natural scale,” she says. “So we are always trying to challenge ourselves – and our fish. The idea of having the fish navigate on land seemed exactly like the impossible sort of challenge we like to tackle. Lucky for us it was not so impossible after all.” The technical term for their challenge is “domain transfer methodology”, which means exploring whether a species can perform tasks outside its own environment. To pull it off, they drew inspiration from work that taught rodents and dogs to use an automated vehicle to reach a target and a previously designed contraption, “Fish on Wheels”. First, the team, led by Prof Ronen Segev, created a watery tank on wheels that moved in response to the movements and orientation of the fish. Then they set about teaching the goldfish (Carassius auratus) how to drive it – much like humans learn to ride a bike or drive a car. The fish first had to connect their own swimming movements to the movements of the vehicle so they could navigate it. Then they were given a destination: a pink target board in a foreign room that elicited a food reward when the vehicle touched it. A computerised camera system attached to this “fish operated vehicle” recorded and translated the fish’s swimming directions. After several days of training, the fish successfully navigated the vehicle to the target from different starting positions in the room – even if they faced obstacles like false targets or hitting a wall. Some did particularly well. “Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley are the two fish featured in the different videos and were total rock stars,” Givon says. Although previous studies have shown that fish can navigate within aquatic environments, the authors suggest this study shows the ability to navigate – which is essential for animal survival in many domains including for finding food, shelter and mates – is universal to all species and independent of the environment. “Since on the evolutionary scale our common ancestor is very, very far back,” Givon says, “finding that fish share navigational skills similar to our own really speaks volumes to the importance of these skills in the animal kingdom”. By manipulating different variables, the team also showed that the fish used a combination of cues to navigate, including the target’s colour and location. We clearly have a lot to learn from these unassuming little marine creatures. Although fish are the largest and most diverse group of vertebrates, Givon notes they receive relatively little attention from scientists – especially with regard to their cognitive skills. However, there are suggestions that fish have rich capacities beyond our own for vision, hearing, tasting and smelling. They even appear to use electric signals to communicate with each other and may have self-awareness. The new study has other ramifications for our perception of the maligned goldfish, Givon suggests. “Maybe, just maybe, we also managed to disprove the stigma around goldfish and three-second memory …”",News/Environment,Goldfish who can drive: why scientists taught fish to navigate a watery tank on wheels,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/09/goldfish-who-can-drive-why-scientists-taught-fish-to-navigate-a-watery-tank-on-wheels
1/9/2022,"Record numbers of Omicron-driven infections are turning into rapidly rising numbers of Covid patients in hospital. Staff absences, which have now reached 80,000 a day, are severely hampering the response. All on top of very high demand for non-Covid care during the most pressured four weeks in the NHS calendar. There is good news. The vaccines are working. The surge of seriously ill older people the NHS saw last January, and feared so much this time, has not yet materialised. London, the original UK epicentre of Omicron, looks like it is now stabilising.  But after a decade of the deepest financial squeeze in NHS history, the health and care frontline is going to be stretched perilously thin in places over the next three weeks, as evidenced by the 25 trusts who have needed to declare a critical incident in the last week. Trust leaders tell us that, due to the dedication, professionalism and flexibility of NHS staff and managers, the line should just about hold. As we have demonstrated over the last 18 months, thanks to our national structure, the NHS can deliver in ways many other national health systems can’t. We can booster-vaccinate a higher proportion of our vulnerable population more quickly and administer a higher number of new, life-saving, antiviral drugs than any other nation in Europe. As we saw on 18 January 2021, when the NHS coped with 40,000 Covid patients in hospital on the same day, trusts can rally around to help neighbours when they hit serious trouble. We can create “insurance policy” super-surge capacity across the country at incredible pace, with the first eight hubs now in place. We can create virtual wards, using new technology to monitor less seriously ill patients remotely, only bringing them into hospital when needed. These are the advantages of a single, taxpayer-funded, national system. A system with a proper national and regional infrastructure to support local trusts to work together to meet collective patient need, free from the requirement to maximise individual organisational profit. But we must be open and honest about the impact this degree of pressure is having on patients and staff. And we need to recognise the pressure extends well beyond hospitals. Ambulances, mental health and community services, GPs and social care face unprecedented challenges too. Despite that extraordinary effort from the NHS frontline, thousands of patients are having to wait longer than the NHS would want for urgent care. For 999 calls to be answered. For ambulances to hand over patients to hospitals. For patients to be seen promptly in accident and emergency departments and discharged back home or to the care sector. And, despite trusts working incredibly hard to avoid this, they are now having to delay planned care again, adding further to the growing care backlog. There is a clear, regrettable, impact on quality of care and, in the most pressured parts of the system, a worrying increase in patient safety risk. The impact on frontline staff is also significant given that we are asking them, once again, to make an extraordinary effort. While some may live with the pressure, after two years of being on a “war footing”, others are now burning out. Trust leaders are doing all they can to support their staff as effectively as possible, while managing the personal impact on their own lives. But there are some serious frustrations that still need to be addressed nationally, such as consistent and timely access to lateral flow and PCR tests when needed. Covid-19 is, hopefully, a once-in-a-generation challenge. But when any system comes under pressure, its weakest links are revealed. It is now very clear that the NHS and our social care system do not have sufficient capacity. That asking staff to work harder and harder to address that gap is simply not sustainable. That we need a long-term, fully funded, workforce plan to attract and retain the extra 1 million health and care staff the Health Foundation estimates will be needed by 2031. And that we need a national transformation programme that embeds modern technology, 21st century medicine, integrated care closer to home and much greater emphasis on prevention at the heart of our health and care system. These are the longer-term issues we will need to address once this immediate challenge has been met.

1/9/2022,"Nasa engineers yesterday completed the final unfolding of the huge primary mirror of the agency’s James Webb space telescope. The manoeuvre was the final step of the $10bn observatory’s two-week deployment phase that began with its launch on Christmas Day. The telescope, which has already travelled more than 600,000 miles across space, is the largest, most powerful space telescope ever built and had to be folded up tightly, so it would fit inside its Ariane 5 launch rocket.  Since then, engineers have been directing the slow unfolding, piece by piece, of the observatory as it heads on its voyage to a gravitationally stable point a million miles from the Earth. Its tennis-court size sun shield – which will keep its delicate instruments cold – have already been deployed as well its secondary mirror. Last week, Nasa began the final manoeuvres involved in deploying the Webb’s main mirror, which will collect light from the furthest depths of the universe and which is made up of 18 gold-coated segments: a central section plus two three-segment side panels. In a sequence of delicate moves, the first panel was successfully deployed on Friday, a process that took five-and-a-half hours. And this was followed up yesterday when engineers released the final, second segment of mirrors which slotted into the mirror’s central core, thus completing the telescope’s vast 6.5 metre diameter mirror. Last night engineers were completing the final latching manoeuvres that will hold this last segment in place. “I just feel this kind of glow in my chest right now just seeing that mirror deployed all together,” Nasa scientist Michelle Thaller said in a live webcast. In the Nasa control room, staff from the Webb mission team cheered and shared high-fives. Described as a “time machine” by scientists, the James Webb telescope will allow astronomers to study the beginning of the universe shortly after the big bang, 13.8 billion years ago, and to hunt for signs of life-supporting planets in our own galaxy. The James Webb, named after a former Nasa administrator, still has to travel 400,000 miles to its destination and will then need five more months for its instruments to be carefully calibrated. For astonomers, the James Webb offers the prospect of capturing images of the first galaxies to form after the big bang, understanding how stars are born and evolve, and investigating the potential for life to appear in planetary systems. All this will have to be done in a decade, its maximum likely lifetime. After 10 years, it is expected the telescope will run out of fuel and slowly drift off course.",News/Science,Nasa engineers complete the unfolding of the James Webb space telescope,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/08/nasa-engineers-complete-the-unfolding-of-the-james-webb-space-telescope
