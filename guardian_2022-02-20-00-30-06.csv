2/20/2022,"St Helens extended their unbeaten start to the Super League season with a comfortable victory against a Hull FC side who played almost an hour with 12 men after the dismissal of their captain, Luke Gale. The reigning champions were far too good for the home side in a game played in appalling conditions, though their cause was helped by the dismissal of Gale midway through the first half after a dangerous challenge on Jonny Lomax. Hull have had a man sent off in their opening two games and while they were good enough to grind out a win at Wakefield last week after Jake Connor was shown a red card, they were outclassed by Saints.  The visitors played the numerical advantage and the horrific conditions to perfection. By half-time, they had crafted an unassailable 20-0 lead courtesy of two tries from Josh Simm, another from Mark Percival and four goals from the boot of Tommy Makinson. Hull offered little in response even before Gale was sent off when he made contact with Lomax’s leg with his boot and they struggled even more when their captain and chief playmaker left the field. The outstanding Jack Welsby had a hand in all three of the visitors’ tries in the first half and the 20-year-old scored their fourth try shortly after the restart with a wonderful piece of individual play. Welsby caught the defence off-guard and kicked through before grounding just ahead of Jamie Shaul to give Makinson the simplest of conversions to make it 26-0. Josh Griffin capitalised on a rare Welsby error to touch down, but the game soon shifted back in the direction of Saints. They extended their lead further when Sione Mata’utia barged his way through a tiring defensive line before Lewis Dodd rounded off another impressive performance and result for Saints with a superb solo effort.",Sport/Sport,Jack Welsby helps St Helens outclass 12-man Hull in appalling conditions,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/19/hull-st-helens-super-league-rugby-league-match-report
2/20/2022,"Concerns are growing among Tory MPs about proposals that would scrap free prescriptions in England for some people aged between 60 and 65, as ministers search for ways to stem rising NHS costs. Charities have already sounded their alarm at a consultation by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) proposing to link free prescriptions to the retirement age, meaning the threshold would rise from 60 to 66 years old. It is estimated to save the Treasury more than £250m a year, but comes as MPs are already concerned about rising living costs.  Ministers have been considering the move for months, but no decision has yet been taken on the move that could affect more than 2 million people. The new system would see them paying £9.35 per-item cost for medicines prescribed by their GP, unless they qualified for free prescriptions in another way. Prescription changes are often made in April, meaning a decision could be imminent. The former Tory health minister Dan Poulter said that ministers should consider whether a time of rising living costs was the right moment to increase the age for free prescriptions. “Under the coalition government, we looked at raising the age at which people are entitled to a free prescription to link it with retirement age, but at that time, we were in the midst of a period of stagnating wages, so we decided that for the relatively modest savings it would generate, it was not the right time to implement the policy,” he said. “While I can still see the logic of linking the entitlement to a free prescription with the retirement age, it would be a brave government that decided to implement this policy at a time of rising household bills and increases in national insurance. In my view, it would be more prudent for the government to reconsider this matter at a later date.” In another sign of Tory unease, Stephen Metcalfe, the Conservative MP for South Basildon and East Thurrock, has also warned in parliament that he did not want to see the current rules around free prescriptions changed. While ministers insist that no decision has been taken so far, the government has argued that about 90% of community prescription items were already free of charge, while those on low incomes or certain medical conditions did not have to pay. The government has also said that the upper age limit for free prescriptions has not changed since 1995, meaning it had become completely disconnected from the pension age.",News/Society,Tory MPs raise fears over free prescription cuts in England for ages 60-65,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/19/tory-mps-raise-fears-over-free-prescription-cuts-in-england-for-ages-60-65
2/20/2022,"Kingslee James McLean Daley, better known as Akala, 38, is a rapper, author, activist and poet from Kentish Town, north London. In 2006 he won a Mobo for best hip-hop act; in 2009, founded the Hip-hop Shakespeare Company; and in 2015 won a Bafta for a BBC Two series about Romantic poetry. His publications include 2018’s bestselling Natives: Race and Class in the Ruins of Empire, graphic novel Visions, and YA novel The Dark Lady, about street life in Renaissance England, out now in paperback. His conversation about it with Mustafa the Poet can be seen on the Southbank Centre’s website until 6 March.  Lila Iké: The ExPerience Lila Iké is a Jamaican reggae artist – she’s like a Jamaican Lauryn Hill, in a way: plays guitar, sings, raps, extraordinarily talented, top quality songwriter. She has an album out called The ExPerience, which I’m listening to a lot. Stars Align is probably my favourite song of hers. It’s just a really gorgeous love song: it reflects that moment when you first meet someone and it feels like the stars have aligned to bring you together, you’ve got butterflies in your stomach and you can’t really look at the other person because you feel a bit self-conscious – that almost teenage love. The Harder They Fall (dir Jeymes Samuel) I went to the premiere of this film, starring Idris Elba and Regina King. It’s basically a black western – Jeymes Samuel blended the stories of different real-life black cowboys and created this fictional story around the central character of Rufus Buck. It’s really well written, funny and action-packed – just a great movie. I haven’t seen Idris do a mean character since Stringer Bell [in The Wire], apart from a brief appearance in American Gangster. So it was nice to see that side of his acting again. Billions (Sky) My current TV show of choice, which stars Damian Lewis and Paul Giamatti. It’s about a hedge-fund billionaire who’s in beef with a lawyer; they’re both in love with the same woman, so it’s partly a love triangle. And it’s also really a philosophical discussion of free-market capitalism versus the state, in the incarnation of these two characters. Lewis is just a fantastic actor. There’s a scene at the end of series one where the two leads have a face-to-face confrontation – their Pacino De Niro Heat moment. It’s a great scene, with unbelievably sharp dialogue. Verzuz music battles I haven’t been to a gig for quite some time, other than my own. But during lockdown it felt like everybody in my world was tuned into [US webcast series] Verzuz: cultural clashes between various icons within the music of the African diaspora. So for Jamaica they did Bounty Killer v Beenie Man, for neo soul they did Erykah Badu v Jill Scott. As a concept, it provided such cultural enrichment. The highlight for me was Jadakiss’s performance in the clash between Dipset and the Lox – it was beautiful to see him having a resurgence with a moment like that. The Status Game: On Social Position and How We Use It by Will Storr This is a really interesting book about the way we use and view status. It looks at social media and how it brings out our most argumentative, status-seeking side, but also at what Storr calls success games, which he says are the best kinds of status games – if you’re, say, Lionel Messi or Stevie Wonder, at least your form of status brings joy to others. He argues that even when we’re not conscious of it, we treat people differently based on our perception of who they are, their achievements, their background – that it’s human nature to play games of status. Tupac Shakur: Wake Me When I’m Free at the Canvas, LA Live, Los Angeles This is a really good, expansive exhibition, and shows you just how much Tupac achieved by the age of 25. It has all his lyrics written out, business ideas he was dealing with, and audio of Tupac speaking. It takes about an hour to get round it – it presents Tupac as the artist of stature he was. It’s hard to think of another hip-hop artist, dead or alive, for whom this scale of a show could be done.

2/20/2022,"Another week and the smell of another celebrity cooking show permeates the air. Gavin Rossdale, of 90s grunge-adjacent, arena-stuffing band Bush, is the latest star to turn to cookery, with Deadline reporting that he is to launch a cooking and entertainment show called E.A.T. In it, he will talk to celebrity guests, including Tom Jones, at his house in the Hollywood Hills, while designing, preparing and making them a three-course meal. He is part of a broader picture of celebrities widening their repertoires and his is not the first celebrity-to-chef shift of recent times. Those who follow such news will be familiar with Brooklyn Beckham’s move from photography to cookery, Cookin’ With Brooklyn, a social media series presumably conceived of as rhyme first, content later, in which Beckham describes making a sandwich, but confuses slices of bread with loaves. (Unless he really does put fish between two loaves of bread. Maybe that’s the twist.) Selena Gomez learns to cook on Selena + Chef, which is like a high-end version of that bit on Sunday Brunch where soap stars chuck flour in a bowl and pretend to enjoy baking. Sadly, Paris Hilton’s Netflix show, Cooking With Paris, has not been renewed for a second series, despite being a work of genuine high art.  In an era of fame for fame’s sake, it gets harder and harder to work out what most celebrities do. Famous people now insist on doing a bit of everything, even interviewing other famous people, a format beloved of pivot-to-podcast celebrities, though it rarely pays off; with a handful of exceptions, it’s far too cosy and polite. Travel shows used to be fronted by professional travellers or explorers. Now, any comedian who’s done 15 minutes on Live at the Apollo gets given a camper van and a GoPro. The problem with this celebrity vogue for cooking – and travel shows, podcasts and so on – is that I’d still rather watch actual chefs in the kitchen, using their years of training and expertise to explain how to do something. (Gomez gets a pass, because she’s more student than cook.) I know it’s old-fashioned, in these post-expert times, to value skill over personality, but cookery isn’t even a field that’s lacking in personalities. I have no idea if Rossdale can cook and perhaps the show will reveal that he’s the René Redzepi/David Frost hybrid we’ve all been waiting for. However, the idea that cooking is in dire need of special celebrity sparkle is as daft as making a sandwich with two loaves of bread. We are mid-awards season and award ceremonies are still being reformed, revised and polished up. Some have taken categories that were previously divided by gender and removed gender from consideration, which did not stop women winning the bulk of the awards at the Brits a couple of weeks ago, or from dominating the Berlin film festival, which gave its Golden Bear to Alcarràs, directed by Carla Simón. The Oscars, shunted to the end of March, remain the grande dame of the season, haughtily adjusting her bosom as the young ’uns play havoc at her feet. But it has famously struggled to find its identity in recent years and ratings have fallen away. It seems as tough to recruit a presenter as it is to find anyone who is up for replacing Laura Kuenssberg, but this year the ceremony has opted for three presenters: Wanda Sykes, Amy Schumer and Regina Hall. It will be the first time that three women have hosted and hopefully it will resemble the heady days of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler’s reign at the now less-appealing Golden Globes. In the spirit of reform, the Oscars have also added a sort of people’s choice moment, allowing Twitter users to vote for their favourite film of 2021, regardless of its nomination status, by tweeting #OscarsFanFavorite. This will then be “recognised” during the ceremony, though that sounds like it’s being held at a careful arm’s length – will it get a chocolate Oscar instead? I can’t imagine that there will be any problems at all, whatsoever, no way, with using a Twitter hashtag as a voting device. In 2019, Taylor Swift tweeted that she was “ecstatic” to announce that she would be headlining Glastonbury on its 50th birthday. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but it has been an eventful couple of years and while all fingers are crossed that the festival will go ahead this summer for the first time since 2019, rumours have emerged suggesting that Swift will not be rolling over her booking. In other words, she is not feeling ’22. Right now, Billie Eilish is confirmed as the headliner on Friday night and, it’s rumoured, Kendrick Lamar on Sunday night, leaving one main slot to fill. But the beauty of Glastonbury, above almost every other festival, is that it hardly matters who is playing at all. It’s so vast that you’re as likely to spend an unknowable amount of time trying to find your way out of the gong bath section as you are making sure you see an act that seemed essential when the tickets arrived. I would love to see Swift at Glastonbury. She is an exquisite performer with a decade of hits to her name. Hopefully, it will still happen, at some point, but I am sure this year’s crowd will, forgive me, shake it off.

2/20/2022,"Channing Tatum, wrapped in a silk kimono, sucks on a weed lollipop. The scene is a perfect distillation of the actor’s appeal: goofy, flirtatious, manly but never macho. Those qualities are expertly drawn out in this charming comedy-drama, in which Tatum stars and co-directs with Magic Mike writer Reid Carolin. Tatum’s Briggs, an ex-soldier, must drive his recently deceased army buddy’s angsty military dog, Lulu, from Washington to Arizona for her owner’s funeral. Both man and canine have PTSD, and the unlikely odd couple bare their teeth at one another, before their relationship softens. Their journey plays out like a classic romcom, complete with a fun riff on the “race to the airport” ending that has become a cliche of the genre.  What’s more surprising than watching Tatum share a bath with a Belgian malinois is the message nestled among the film’s sillier capers. In Portland, Briggs is subjected to smug liberals who make unfair assumptions about his “toxic masculinity” and complicity in “ecological warfare”. In San Francisco he is forced to confront his own prejudices when a drug addict – and former war veteran – breaks into his car. Tatum and Carolin cleverly use the road trip as a mechanism for a conversation about gentleness, connection and how to heal America’s political divides.

2/20/2022,"Lindsey Pearlman, an actor known for television series including General Hospital and Chicago Justice, was found dead in Hollywood several days after going missing, authorities and her husband said. She was 43. “Today around 8.30am, Hollywood area officers responded to a radio call for a death investigation at Franklin Avenue and North Sierra Bonita Avenue,” Los Angeles police said on Friday.  “The LA county coroner’s office has since confirmed the individual to be Lindsey Erin Pearlman. The cause of death will be determined by the coroner.” Her husband, Vance Smith, said on Instagram: “The police found Lindsey. She’s gone. I’m broken. I will share more later, but I wanted to thank you to everyone for their love and efforts and ask you to respect the privacy of her family at this time.” In a 16 February missing person advisory, LA police said Pearlman was reported missing after she “failed to return home and has not been seen or heard from since”. The department also said “friends and family fear for her safety”. Police said Pearlman was last seen at about noon on 13 February. Smith said that was incorrect, and she was last seen at about 9pm on 15 February. A graduate of the Second City Conservatory, Pearlman moved from Chicago to LA after landing a recurring role on Chicago Justice, made by NBC, and in order to pursue more on-camera work, according to her website. The “about” page on the website describes her personality in good-humored fashion and lists her many roles. “Lindsey loves 90s R&B. She is an activist for animals and humans,” the page says. “Her bat mitzvah bash is still the standard to which she holds all parties. Lindsey’s bladder is tiny, so remind her to pee before the movie starts please.” Pearlman was also an improviser and made numerous stage appearances in Chicago. For seven years, she performed in a touring show called Sex Signals, “which uses comedy to broach the difficult topic of sexual assault awareness at military bases and college campuses”.",News/US news,"Lindsey Pearlman, US TV actor, found dead after being reported missing",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/19/lindsey-pearlman-tv-actor-dies-hollywood
2/20/2022,"Japan has set itself on a diplomatic collision course with South Korea by applying for Unesco world heritage status for gold and silver mines on an island off its west coast which used forced labour from Korea. The row over the mines – on Sado island in the Sea of Japan – is expected to further sour relations between the countries just as the US is pressing them to present a united front against North Korea’s nuclear programme.  The mines are among dozens of industrial sites that played a key role in Japan’s modernisation but relied on slave labour. An estimated 780,000 Koreans worked in mines and factories during Japan’s 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula, many in appalling conditions and without proper pay or holidays. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, nominated the mines this month after pressure from conservatives in his party including former prime minister Shinzo Abe. This drew an angry response from South Korea, whose foreign ministry accused Japan of “ignoring the painful history of forced labour for Koreans”. Kishida said: “We are aware that South Korea has its own opinions. That’s why we feel we should have meaningful, rational dialogue.” In recent years, groups of former labourers and their families have attempted to win compensation from Japanese companies including powerful conglomerates such as Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. But South Korean court rulings finding for the plaintiffs have been dismissed by Japan, which maintains that compensation claims stemming from the war were settled “completely and finally” by a 1965 bilateral treaty. Companies that do not comply with the rulings risk having their assets in South Korea seized – a move observers say would harm the economies of both countries. The 400-year-old Sado mine complex, which closed in 1989, was once among the world’s biggest gold producers, but its success was partly built on the exploitation of more than 1,000 Korean labourers. In an editorial, the Korea Herald called the Unesco proposal “shameful”, adding: “Japan’s move to list the site … is a thinly veiled to attempt to whitewash the brutality that took place during its rule of Korea. For Koreans, the Sado mine is one of many sites illustrating the atrocities of Japanese colonialism amid the long-running view that Japan has yet to issue a sincere apology and offer proper compensation.”A Unesco advisory body will survey the complex and decide whether to include it in the list of heritage sites – a status that would encourage tourism and attract funds for protection and conservation. The World Heritage Committee, which includes Japan but not South Korea, will make a final decision next summer. Japan has faced charges of attempting to ignore dark episodes from its past before: more than 20 Meiji era (1868-1912) industrial sites were added to Unesco’s world cultural heritage list in 2015. Although some of these places, including a coalmine on Gunkanjima island, had used forced labour, Japan was admonished by Unesco for failing to honour a commitment to explain that their workforces had included thousands of exploited Koreans. Local government descriptions of the Sado mines do not mention their use of Korean labourers. Ties between South Korea and Japan are at their lowest level for years amid disputes over forced labour and “comfort women” – girls and women, mainly from the Korean peninsula, forced to work in Japanese military brothels before and during the war. The US has called on leaders in Seoul and Tokyo to resolve the row and focus on addressing threats posed by a more aggressive China and an unpredictable North Korea.",News/World news,Japan and South Korea in row over mines that used forced labour,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/japan-and-south-korea-in-row-over-mines-that-used-forced-labour
