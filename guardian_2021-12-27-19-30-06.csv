Maybe GodMaybe God was hungry. * The moon was OK.There were holes in it,We saw biscuits and things at the bottom. It was raining, the cardboard melted.Tomorrow can we build a boat? Wait! We brought you back a secret,but we’re going to tell it to the zebras first –the black one with stripes painted white,the white one with stripes painted black, who sleep on the landing,leaving just enough room to squeeze by. Published in 2001, The Age of Cardboard and String is the title poem of Charles Boyle’s final collection to date. After what he calls “an amicable separation” from the Muse, he has gone on to be the founder-editor of CB Editions, and continues writing in other genres. A mock voyage narrative adroitly divided into three, the sequence opens with a riddle. Put the various functions of the “machine” together, and what do you get? A cardboard box transformed by a child’s imagination? Or is “it” the “age” of the title, symbolised by the cardboard box with strings attached – in the more ominous sense of that phrase? There’s also the question of the narrator’s identity. While a child-spokesperson is the easy answer, the poem’s diction doesn’t represent a big stylistic departure for the poet. So, to state the rather obvious, this “child’s voice” has adult knowledge. We’re not expected to believe we’re hearing the fully reliable transcription of a real six-year-old’s words. I’ve hit on the idea of a six-year-old male narrator because of the reference to Anna in the second poem of the sequence. The urgent desire to “drive” faster than a seven-year-old girl suggests younger male sibling’s rivalry. Anna surely has her own vehicle, and (although I hardly dare say this) it’s probably one less liable to fall apart than the boy’s. This “machine” is a casual though versatile construction for “eating oranges”, “humming new tunes” and travelling to the moon. To the adult, though not the child, it is “whatever string you pull, the same machine”. There are venial, adult associations with the metaphor “pulling strings” and possibly a suggestion of “leg-pulling”. The functions of the machine, not at all clear-cut, convey a lively muddle of motives and desires. The emphasis seems to fall on creative imagination in the first poem. After the machine’s breakdown comes the failed mending and the sulky tears. The latter perhaps help the glue to hold next time, and soon the lunar rocket is launched. All the possibilities are united: “we set off for the moon, / scattering orange peel on the floor / and singing songs not yet written down – / hot, fierce songs // that almost burn our mouths with their newness”. The excitement is sharply drawn. If it had finished here, we’d conclude (with a glance towards William Carlos Williams) that this was a poem about writing poetry. Social interactions in the second poem emphasise competition, greed, and crafty excuse-making. More than ever, the children’s self-portrait seems a lightly disguised representation of adult behaviour. The portrayal of a deity driven by appetite (“Maybe God was hungry”) is particularly revealing. A light shrug of disappointment accompanies the report on the voyage in the third poem. The longed-for moon was only “OK”. There were holes in it, and at the bottom of the holes merely “biscuits and things” (a perfect expression of consumerist ennui). The moon itself might have been made of cardboard and string. Rain has subsequently “melted” the spaceship, but an eager new desire is born: “tomorrow, can we build a boat?” Since God entered the picture, it’s easy to imagine a reference to Noah’s Ark at this juncture. And perhaps the addition of the two zebras amplifies that thought. The awareness of the zebras’ presence, and especially the awareness of the distinction between them, seems to insulate the child’s consciousness. Their special secret may never be divulged to the adult listener. Generational menace may be implied by the size of the zebras “who sleep on the landing, / leaving just enough room to squeeze by” (room for children only, it seems). At the core of the sequence, too-ingenious humans seem to want too much – “gears, automatic transmission, wings, clouds / to fly through, flags, fuel injection, / solar panels, stabilisers, sometimes just / to be left alone”. Like the children’s voyage-game, the poem is more than playful. It illuminates how fatefully the best and worst of human possibilities are fused.

12/27/2021,"From a solar-powered crib that treats jaundiced babies to fibre made from water hyacinth that absorbs oil spills, innovators from nine African countries have been shortlisted for the Royal Academy of Engineering’s 2022 Africa prize. This year half of the shortlist of 16 are women, and for the first time it includes Togolese and Congolese inventors. The entrepreneurs will undergo eight months of business training and mentoring before a winner is chosen, who will receive £25,000, and three runners-up, who win £10,000 each. All the projects are sustainable solutions to issues such as access to healthcare, farming resilience, reducing waste, and energy efficiency. The Guardian spoke to three of the shortlisted candidates.  Soon after her son, Tonbra, was born in 2015, Virtue Oboro’s mother noticed the baby’s eyes and skin looked yellow and they rushed him to hospital in Yenagoa, in the southern state of Bayelsa. But three of the hospital’s five phototherapy units for jaundiced babies were faulty and the other two were in use. Tonbra was eventually found a place in a phototherapy unit but, when there was a power cut, he developed severe jaundice. “He had to have an emergency blood transfusion, which was traumatising. We had to buy blood from an external source, which made us nervous. It was really tough,” says Oboro, 32, a graphic artist and product designer. Her boy recovered, but the experience inspired Oboro and her husband to form Tiny Hearts Technology, the creators of Crib A’Glow, a solar-powered portable phototherapy crib that treats and monitors jaundiced newborns. So far, about 300,000 babies have been treated directly with the cribs in hospitals and homes in Nigeria and Ghana. Today, the Tiny Hearts team comprises engineers, designers and paediatricians, and also educates health workers and pregnant women about jaundice, which Oboro believes has saved many more babies. “I didn’t spot the symptoms myself,” she says. “Like many new mothers, I didn’t know about jaundice.” Newborns develop jaundice when their levels of bilirubin – a natural substance formed when red blood cells break down – are abnormally high. It can lead to death and also cause brain damage, cerebral palsy and hearing loss. Although it is common – affecting about 60% of newborns worldwide – devices to treat babies with blue-light therapy are expensive and unsuitable for poorly resourced hospitals with unreliable electricity. About 100,000 deaths from jaundice are recorded annually and many more babies suffer permanent injury. It took Oboro five attempts to perfect the design for Crib A’Glow, which runs on solar power, is foldable and costs about a tenth of phototherapy devices used in developed countries. The light rays focus on the baby’s body to ensure maximum efficiency, and using LED lights avoids skin burns, dehydration and rashes that can be common side-effects of such devices, she says. “Not only does the crib provide access to phototherapy, it provides phototherapy that is sustainable and lasts long enough for the baby to recover. This also reduces congestion in hospitals in Nigeria because babies recover more quickly,” says Oboro, adding that the cribs can be moved next to their mothers’ beds during treatment. “Because of Covid, other causes of infant mortality, such as jaundice, have not been given much attention. But Covid didn’t make the other problems go away. “The crib will reduce infant mortality and disabilities in Nigeria, and make the job of healthcare workers easier,” says Oboro, who is developing a solar-powered incubator and hopes to form partnerships with development agencies and donors to take her innovations across the continent. The crib is already used in 70 hospitals across Nigeria. “We import a high proportion of medical devices – but it is important to have homegrown solutions that are accessible and affordable for every community here. Healthcare providers can quickly provide feedback on homegrown devices,” she says. “The hardest part for us was acceptability. At first, it was difficult to convince people the crib would be effective,” Oboro says, “partly because I’m not from a medical background. But it’s as if a battle was fought and won – now my son and I feel like winners every day.” So destructive is the water hyacinth plant to lakes and rivers in Africa that fishermen call it “the curse”, says Divin Kouebatouka, a 32-year-old engineer who is the first Congolese innovator on the shortlist. “When I returned to my mother’s village on the banks of Lake Djoue after studying engineering abroad, I saw an invasive plant that had literally invaded the lake, blocked marine navigation and asphyxiated the fish,” he says. “It had halted fishing activity, which is the main economic resource of the village.” Kouebatouka, a Colorado State University graduate who says he is motivated by protecting the environment after being struck by the impact of the climate crisis on the Congo at a young age, began to think about possible benefits of the water hyacinth plant, which is native to the Amazon basin but now found across the world and whose rapid spread has been intensified by global heating. “We studied the properties of hyacinth and found it is rich in nitrate, which is good for compost; rich in protein, which is good for animal feed; and it has a high absorbency,” he says. “It could also solve another environmental problem: the leakage of oil – the main cause of marine pollution in the Congo. So we decided to create a ‘bridge’ between two environmental problems – each one should be a solution to the other.” His team at Green Tech Africa developed a way to turn the plant’s stems into highly absorbent fibre that can suck up oil from the ground or water, or plug an oil leak in a container. Today more than 10 companies buy the product, called Kukia, which can hold up to 17 times its weight in hydrocarbons, the compounds that form the basis of crude oil. In 2018 the idea was nominated for the African entrepreneurship award. The Republic of the Congo has large reserves of crude oil and natural gas. Oil spills are common in industrial processes and the automotive and shipping industries. Kukia is sold to petrochemical and pollution control companies and the public through fuel stations and wholesalers. The project has also provided employment for local people who collect the plant and produce the fibre, earning more than the average agricultural wage. There are almost 900 collectors, 80% of whom are women. “We collected more than 5,000 cubic metres of water hyacinth – equivalent to two football stadiums of water hyacinth – on the banks of the Congo River, which made it possible to restore the waterways, promote the resumption of fishing and restore economic activities for a population of more than 100,000 people,” says Kouebatouka. “Parts of the plant that aren’t useful for the fibre are used elsewhere – roots are composted and leaves turned into animal feed. Once the stem fibre has been used on an oil spill or leak, it can be repurposed as a fuel source by cement factories,” he says. For Green Tech Africa, the next step is to establish a biorefinery to produce energy and a range of products from the invasive plants. “We’ve turned a botanical problem into a solution for an environmental problem, creating employment and skills development along the way. Kukia is simple, scalable and effective, and can make an enormous difference in Congo and worldwide.” “I get emotional when I think about how many children missed out on vaccinations because of Covid,” says Norah Magero, a mechanical engineer. “The pandemic put huge pressure on hospitals and healthcare workers. In Africa, 23 million children [under the age of one] did not get vaccinated because of Covid.” In Kenya, the pandemic highlighted the lack of “cold-chain” infrastructure for storing vaccines, which 33-year-old Magero experienced. “Soon after I had my child in 2018, I moved from Nairobi to a rural area. I realised it was really hard to get her vaccinated. There were so many blackouts and ice-packs melted, so vaccines were no longer viable. “Digging deeper, I realised the problem was not just the lack of reliable power, but also that women who had gone once or twice to get the vaccines might not go back a third time. It might be expensive or difficult to travel and so they just gave up. I might have had the same thought myself – this is just too difficult. “I am an engineer and an energy manager and so I asked myself: why isn’t there an engineering solution to this problem. I am passionate about bringing up technology because it plays a huge role in closing the gaps. But it has to be affordable.” The organisation Magero founded, Drop Access, hopes to close the gap with VacciBox, a mobile solar-powered fridge that safely stores and delivers temperature-sensitive vaccines to communities and hospitals where there is a lack of cold-chain infrastructure. “Hospitals are in a race against time with vaccines and that is the case in most rural communities,” she says. “We need a solution to stop thousands of people missing out on life-saving vaccines.” The solar fridge has a data-monitoring facility and battery backup so it does not run out of power. Costing €800 (£680) to produce, the 40-litre box can be carried on motorbikes, bicycles and boats. “So far, we have piloted the fridge at two rural healthcare facilities. The first is at Merrueshi village health centre in Kajiado county in Kenya, located in a Maasai conservancy. The facility faces frequent power outages and used to use a soda fridge to store vaccines. It is the nearest health centre for a population of at least 400,000. “Every Wednesday, Maasai women would walk for miles to bring their children to be vaccinated. Currently, with VacciBox, the health centre can conduct field-based and door-to-door vaccinations, which has increased their monthly vaccination numbers by 150%.” The second trial is at the Usungu dispensary in Makueni county, 14 miles (22km) from the nearest electricity grid. The health worker used to transport vaccines twice a week from the nearest hospitals and return what was left at the end of the day or when ice-packs began to melt. With VacciBox, the dispensary can stock up to 1,000 vaccines a week without worrying about the vaccines spoiling. Magero says so far the team has carried out 2,100 vaccinations, mostly of children, and intends to expand into Covid vaccinations. “The AstraZeneca vaccine operates within that 2C to 8C [35.6F-46.4F] temperature range we cover,” she says. By 2024, she hopes to have produced 1,500 units and to have vaccinated 3 million children. The box can also be used to transport blood and tissue and can be monitored remotely before deciding to send out a technician if it stops working. An app helps keep track of the condition of the unit as well as the stock and distribution. “Throughout this process, I have been through a range of emotions – from frustration to scepticism to pride,” says Magero. “I had the feeling that I cannot just vaccinate my daughter – she needs classmates and friends. So this is for the mothers – and for all of Kenya.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,Engineering the future: meet the Africa prize shortlist innovators,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/27/engineering-the-future-meet-the-africa-prize-shortlist-innovators
12/27/2021,"Chronicling what was supposed to be the final chapter of Joseph Kabila’s presidency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this is a stark and gripping portrait of a country in the throes of a major political crisis. At the centre of these monumental events are Christian, Jean-Marie and Ben, three young Congolese men who are passionately fighting for democracy, yet in their differing ideologies also embody the fractures that exist inside the resistance movement against Kabila’s unconstitutional clutch on power. Jean-Marie, who like Ben was once jailed and tortured by the police, has faith in UDPS, the opposition party led by Étienne Tshisekedi, and trusts them to call for a fair and legal election once Kabila’s term comes to an end. In contrast, Christian considers the UDPS’ peaceful approach to be ineffective compared with direct protests, which sometimes end in deadly clashes with the armed forces. Much of the film captures the raw energy of these demonstrations: choking tear gas; shaky, frenzied cinematography; the threatening sound of bullets. The frantic breathing of the cameraman is audible as he too runs away from the police.  Rising above the chaos and ideological differences is a movingly collective belief in a democratic Congo; something eloquently expressed through the young men’s T-shirt slogans which speak of “One Congo” and “Congo Love”. Nevertheless, the film could have included more insights from a female perspective; women are mostly seen here as mourning or concerned relatives. Still, this remains a courageous and absorbing documentary, highlighting a new Congolese generation that dares to make their voices heard.

12/27/2021,"Even when it was official, it didn’t seem real. Even when it was repeated, the president standing there saying so, it didn’t ring true. Even after all those warnings, everyone clung to the hope that there might be some solution. Which there was – right before there wasn’t. At about 9pm on 4 August, Lionel Messi and his family landed in Catalonia on a private flight from Ibiza. He came to sign a new contract with Barcelona, all those worries washed away. The next thing they knew, a statement announced that he was leaving.  He had arrived at the club at 13. Now, at 34, having become their everything, he was leaving. No one saw it coming, even if maybe they should have done, and many still didn’t see it then. Messi hadn’t. “We were convinced we were continuing here, at home,” he would eventually say three days later, the delay another reason it felt as if this wasn’t actually happening. The statement was released on 5 August at 7.33pm and soon it was everywhere. “Leo Messi not staying at FC Barcelona,” the headline ran. Wait, what? “Despite FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi having reached an agreement and the clear intention of both parties to sign a new contract today, this cannot happen because of Spanish La Liga regulations on player registrations,” it said. Blame was placed elsewhere, for now. The statement was cold, formulaic and short; it also felt at the time as if it might have been a bluff, one last hand being played. And then there was silence. No grand eulogies, no tearful farewells. No players put messages out and Messi didn’t say anything. As if no one wanted to admit this was over, as if maybe it wasn’t. The next day the president, Joan Laporta, spoke. There was just no room within the league’s salary limits to sign Messi. Even without his salary, the situation was “unsustainable”, his departure insufficient to fix the finances. But even then, it didn’t seem entirely done – the first stage of grief is denial, perhaps – and it was natural to think there must be some way to fix this, something that could be done. Anything. It was only early August and there was still time, even if Laporta said there was little point “prolonging the agony”. What if league officials realised what they would lose and made an exception? What if Messi played for free? The suggestion would recur and however unfair that suggestion was, imagine the impact if he had. When those ideas were floated Laporta didn’t actually say “forget it”; he just said he wouldn’t give “false hope”. Which was ironic, really. When Messi finally spoke, he said he was “not prepared for” his departure and nor was anyone else. Yet in a way they had all been prepared. A year before Messi had announced he wanted to leave. The club’s interim president, Carlos Tusquets, had admitted that economically they should have sold him. And Laporta had been voted into office in response to a critical situation: they knew they really couldn’t afford Messi. Then there was a basic fact too easily overlooked: Messi did not even belong to Barcelona any more. On 1 July, his contract had expired. But there were the other messages. Laporta had campaigned on one basic promise: Messi would stay. Messi ate with Laporta after the elections and an agreement was reached but couldn’t be executed. When his contract expired, a headline in the Catalan daily Sport declared: “Relax! Mess stays at Barcelona.” And although the following morning Laporta admitted: “I would like to announce Messi’s staying but I can’t yet, we’re looking for the best solution,” that seemed ever closer. On 3 July, Laporta ate with the president of the league, Javier Tebas, and left believing a formula had been found. By the middle of July, Barcelona briefed that it was done. But still there was no announcement. When, at last there was one, it said it was off. Laporta would later admit that he held on to the idea that Messi might rescue them all at the last minute and until Messi appeared it was possible to believe in some way out. When he did, there were tears, a hint of recrimination and realisation. It is remarkable how soon people move on. Chants of “Messi” in the 10th minute didn’t even last into the second half of the opening game; his shirt was taken by Ansu Fati, surprisingly fuss-free; banners protested against his departure on the first day but not beyond; and although his shirt is everywhere still, he has not been a ghost, the permanent presence some feared. Yet there are periodic painful reminders, the loss lingers and what really happened is a recurring question to which Laporta is made to return. Was enough really done? Could Messi’s departure have been avoided? Was it just about the money? What role did Real Madrid and the super league project play in all this? What part was played by La Liga? Why did Laporta drag it out so long and then suddenly change his mind? Who changed it for him? Why didn’t he wait longer, exhaust every possible avenue? Oh, and did it even help? That one at least is easily answered: no. Barcelona are eighth in the league and out of the Champions League, in which Messi alone has scored more than double their goals. There was pity in seeing him in Paris, knowing that he didn’t even want to be there, wondering if it didn’t even need to come to this. When Messi was asked whether he could have played for free, he dangled the prospect that he might have done had they only asked. Laporta meanwhile has suggested that Messi could have pushed harder too, a sad split revealed. When Messi’s dad was asked what happened he shot back: “Ask the club.” “I thought it was all sorted,” Messi said. “It’s still hard to assimilate. There have been many defeats, but there’s always another chance. Not this time; this time it’s not coming back.” For all the warnings, hearing it from him hit home. This time it was real. It was 8 August and it was over.",Sport/Football,Jaw-dropping sport moments of 2021: Lionel Messi leaves Barcelona,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/27/jaw-dropping-sport-moments-of-2021-lionel-messi-leaves-barcelona
12/27/2021,"Ihave a fantasy and it goes like this: a political party is formed, running on an anti-social-media platform. It campaigns on a pledge to ban social media. (“SWITCH IT OFF” is its straightforward, and elegant, slogan.) The party wins a general election and at midnight, on what comes to be known as Social Media Freedom Day, the prime minister pushes a giant button that blocks all access to social media. Crowds cheer. On the anniversary of Social Media Freedom Day – which becomes a bank holiday, of course – children burn effigies of Mark Zuckerberg and dress up as the Twitter bird.  I write this as someone who owes her career and her partner to social media. I had no journalism qualifications, connections or experience when I began blogging in the mid-2010s, and through Twitter I was able to get a paid internship that gave me my start in journalism. My boyfriend and I connected through Instagram after years of liking each other’s posts. So much of my personal, and professional happiness has been made possible through social media. But as time has gone on I have become more and more certain that the solution to many of the most pressing issues of our time is simply to switch social media off. I have spent much of 2021 reporting on the pandemic – in particular how the spread of misinformation on social media has pushed people to reject lifesaving vaccinations. I have listened to family members weep as they remember loved ones who would be alive today were it not for social media conspiracy theories. The instinct to dismiss these deaths is a callous one. All of us make bad decisions, not least when you have the weight of the internet pressing upon your cerebral cortex. In October, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testified before Congress about her experiences working at the social media giant. There, she saw evidence that its products were making teenagers anxious, depressed and suicidal, and contributing to ethnic violence in countries such as Ethiopia. Facebook, Haugen concluded, was putting “astronomical profits before people”. And yet the response to these allegations was handwringing followed by a collective shrug. No one seems to be prepared to take the brave, but necessary, step, of unplugging the damn thing. On social media I see grifters pushing quack therapies on impressionable people. I see people radicalised into obsessive hatred of communities of people they’ve never even met. I see cases of a condition I like to call “poster’s brain” – in which habitual social media users feel compelled to post offensive, and often career-ending content – so severe I fear there is no cure. (Like the podcaster who announced to the world earlier this year that he refused to feed his hungry child for six hours until she learned how to open a tin of beans, to name one.) I see ministers debasing the offices of state. Democracies subverted and genocides fomented. And you know what the tech overlords are doing while we are fighting on the internet all day? They are getting extremely rich. They’re paddle-boarding in Hawaii. They’re banning their children from using social media while simultaneously planning a version of Instagram for kids, because our children can grow up anxious, depressed and miserable off the back of their algorithms, but not theirs. And of course, I am entirely complicit. I use social media and even though I try hard not to be cruel on it, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy watching someone I’ve formed a negative opinion about, despite having never met them in real life, get roasted by an internet horde. I’m in the bear pit, eating nuts, enjoying the show. Of course I could delete all my social media accounts. Cancel my season ticket to The Discourse; stop watching as a new villain of the day is crowned on Twitter. You think I don’t want to do that? I Google “lighthouse keeper jobs Orkney” twice a week. But I’m a journalist. The editors who commission me are on social media. I worry about disappearing. And besides, I’m addicted. I’ve checked Twitter eight times writing this piece.

12/27/2021,"Tim Clemons has driven nearly 3 million miles around the US in his 30 years as a truck driver. “This used to be a great job,” said Clemons. “I provide a valuable service to this country. It would be nice if we weren’t looked down upon like trash.”  While the industry says there is a national shortage of drivers and complains regulation is holding back hiring, Florida-based Clemons has another theory: working conditions have deteriorated since he started driving, he said. It’s more difficult to find parking, access to bathrooms. Dispatchers and brokers are pushing harder to deliver loads in a certain amount of time or else drivers face fines or deductions. Drivers earn less. All these factors may explain why annual turnover at big trucking employers averaged 94% between 1995 and 2017. And that’s before Covid upended the supply chain and increased demand for drivers, and the pressures they face. Most facilities Clemons drives to do not provide bathrooms for truck drivers, and many truck stops are backed up with wait times to refuel and use the bathroom. “If you haven’t found a place to park by 2 or 3pm in a truck stop, you’re looking for any place to park, yet we’re fined and towed for just trying to be safe,” Clemons said. “When you have a 300-mile run and six to seven hours to be there, you don’t have time to waste, so either you’re late or you’re on time and refused use of the facilities. As nasty as it may sound, most of us experienced drivers carry garbage bags and a five-gallon bucket, or a potty chair with plastic grocery bags.” According to the American Trucking Associations, the lobbying organization for large trucking employers, the US has a shortage of 80,000 truck drivers that is disrupting the nation’s supply chains, and the shortages are projected to worsen over the next few years. This claim has been repeated consistently over the years and has recently been cited by industry groups in favor of a bill in Congress to lower the commercial driver’s license age requirement from the age of 21 to 18. But truck drivers are quick to highlight the low pay, poor treatment, and poor working conditions they endure throughout the industry as prevailing issues for employers who claim to have trouble finding and retaining enough drivers. “The industry has recycled this narrative about every three months for over 20 years. There is no truck driver shortage,” said Desiree Wood, the president of Real Women in Trucking. “It is indeed a pay shortage and work conditions issue.” The Bureau of Labor Statistics published an article in March 2019 discussing the widespread and constant claims of labor shortages in the trucking industry, but found that if wages rise in the industry, any long-term labor shortages would be improved. “As a whole, the market for truck drivers appears to work as well as any other blue-collar labor market,” the report concluded. Darrell Kirkland, a truck driver based in Georgia for 31 years, explained the various ways in which truck drivers are taken advantage of by operators and shipping receivers, such as working several hours a day without pay due to waiting to pick up or drop off loads. He has waited up to 36 hours, with typical wait times of several hours. “Most drivers don’t get paid for the detention times,” said Kirkland. “A trucking company may allow their customers a two- to three-hour time period, before they start charging detention. So that waiting time the driver doesn’t get paid for and it uses up the driver’s available hours to drive for the day.” Truck drivers are often charged lumbar fees by receiving companies to unload freight, and won’t allow drivers to unload trucks themselves, adding more unpaid time to drivers’ schedules. “Most driver pay is pay per mile, but it varies from one company to another,” added Kirkland. “If the wheels aren’t turning, the driver isn’t earning. Nearly 2 million Americans work as truck drivers, a rate that has steadily increased over the years from around 1.57 million truck drivers in 2000. States issue more than 450,000 commercial driver’s licenses per year. While more Americans are working as truck drivers, wages have drastically declined since the passage of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, which deregulated the US trucking industry. When adjusted for inflation, median wages for truck drivers in 1980 were about $110,000 annually. In 2020, median annual wages for truck drivers were $47,130. Nearly 40% of US truck drivers were covered by union contracts in 1983, which dropped to 10.1% in 2020. Many trucking companies also misclassify drivers as independent contractors, shifting overhead costs on to workers and burdening them with massive amounts of debt for their vehicles, gas, and fees. Billy Randel, a truck driver based in the New York area for decades and chief organizer of Truckers Movement for Justice, explained most truck drivers work 60 to 70 hours per week without overtime pay, as many of the hours are unpaid wait times, from waiting to load and unload, to department of transportation inspections, or having to clean out trailers before picking up a new load. “We’re fed up and we’re tired of having no voice and we’re the power in the industry. Nothing moves without us,” said Randel. “There are too many drivers out here who are homeless and they stay on the road because they have no place to live. “There are too many drivers that actually qualify for federal food-stamp assistance. We want to end the sharecropping outright, and take back the power drivers once had when we were organized many decades ago.”",News/Business,‘This used to be a great job’: US truckers driven down by long hours and low pay,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/27/us-truck-drivers-economy-pay-conditions
12/27/2021,"Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack, has said the panel will open an inquiry into Donald Trump’s phone call seeking to stop Joe Biden’s certification from taking place on 6 January hours before the insurrection. The chairman said the select committee intended to scrutinize the phone call – revealed last month by the Guardian – should they prevail in their legal effort to obtain Trump White House records over the former president’s objections of executive privilege.  “That’s right,” Thompson said when asked by the Guardian whether the select committee would look into Trump’s phone call, and suggested House investigators had already started to consider ways to investigate Trump’s demand that Biden not be certified as president on 6 January. Thompson said the select committee could not ask the National Archives for records about specific calls, but noted “if we say we want all White House calls made on January 5 and 6, if he made it on a White House phone, then obviously we would look at it there.” The Guardian reported last month that Trump, according to multiple sources, called lieutenants based at the Willard hotel in Washington DC from the White House in the late hours of 5 January and sought ways to stop Biden’s certification from taking place on 6 January. Trump first told the lieutenants his vice-president, Mike Pence, was reluctant to go along with the plan to commandeer his ceremonial role at the joint session of Congress in a way that would allow Trump to retain the presidency for a second term, the sources said.But as Trump relayed to them the situation with Pence, the sources said, on at least one call, he pressed his lieutenants about how to stop Biden’s certification from taking place on 6 January in a scheme to get alternate slates of electors for Trump sent to Congress. The former president’s remarks came as part of wider discussions he had with the lieutenants at the Willard – a team led by Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Boris Epshteyn and Trump strategist Steve Bannon – about delaying the certification, the sources said. House investigators in recent months have pursued an initial in into Trump’s contacts with lieutenants at the Willard, issuing a flurry of subpoenas compelling documents and testimony to crucial witnesses, including Bannon and Eastman. But Thompson said that the select committee would now also investigate both the contents of Trump’s phone calls to the Willard and the White House’s potential involvement, in a move certain to intensify the pressure on the former president’s inner circle. “If we get the information that we requested,” Thompson said of the select committee’s demands for records from the Trump White House and Trump aides, “those calls potentially will be reflected to the Willard hotel and whomever.” A spokesperson for the select committee declined to comment about what else such a line of inquiry might involve. But a subpoena to Giuliani, the lead Trump lawyer at the Willard, is understood to be in the offing, according to a source familiar with the matter. The Guardian reported that the night before the Capitol attack, Trump called the lawyers and non-lawyers at the Willard separately, because Giuliani did not want to have non-lawyers participate on sensitive calls and jeopardize claims to attorney-client privilege. It was not clear whether Giulaini might invoke attorney-client privilege as a way to escape cooperating with the investigation in the event of a subpoena, but Congressman Jamie Raskin, a member of the select committee, noted the protection does not confer broad immunity. “The attorney-client privilege does not operate to shield participants in a crime from an investigation into a crime,” Raskin said. “If it did, then all you would have to do to rob a bank is bring a lawyer with you, and be asking for advice along the way.” The Guardian also reported Trump made several calls the day before the Capitol attack from both the White House residence, his preferred place to work, as well as the West Wing, but it was not certain from which location he phoned his top lieutenants at the Willard. The distinction is significant as phone calls placed from the White House residence, even from a landline desk phone, are not automatically memorialized in records sent to the National Archives after the end of an administration. That means even if the select committee succeeds in its litigation to pry free Trump’s call detail records from the National Archives, without testimony from people with knowledge of what was said, House investigators might only learn the target and time of the calls.",News/US news,Capitol panel to investigate Trump call to Willard hotel in hours before attack,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/27/capitol-attack-panel-investigate-trump-call-willard-hotel-before-assault
12/27/2021,"We couldn’t afford for television to let us down in 2021 and – SPOILER ALERT! – it didn’t. It unleashed a torrent of inspiration, dedication and invention, not to mention defecting royals and deadly children’s games. With Covid uncertainty ever present, the most heartbreaking lockdown drama was Jack Thorne’s care home tragedy Help (Channel 4), starring Jodie Comer and Stephen Graham. In pandemic documentaries, actor David Harewood stood out with the forceful Why Is Covid Killing People of Colour? (BBC One).  In a year that saw Channel 4 threatened with privatisation, and the BBC routinely castigated, there were outstanding documentaries, from BBC Two’s compulsive docuseries Blair and Brown: The New Labour Revolution to Channel 4’s harrowing India’s Rape Scandal. Another Observer choice, Uprising (BBC One) forensically outlined seismic shifts in 1980s race relations. Elsewhere, Four Hours at the Capitol (BBC Two) reconstructed the post-Trump defeat invasion of Washington, while Gods of Snooker (BBC Two) delivered the waistcoats, pathos and glory of bygone pot blacking. With so much choice – which channel? What stream? If I sign up for everything, can I still afford to eat? – universal viewing becomes ever rarer. Sporting spectacles got us communing (Euro 2020; the Tokyo Olympics; Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen’s drama-soaked Formula One showdown in Abu Dhabi; British tennis ace Emma Raducanu winning the US Open), while South Korean Netflix smash Squid Game, a fitfully dubbed lethal comment on 21st-century capitalism, was an unlikely global phenomenon. Still, for event TV nonpareil, it has to be ITV’s Oprah With Meghan and Harry. The “Megxit”-ing Sussexes sat on high-end Cali-chic garden furniture to discuss all (race, media, who made whom cry over bridesmaid tights). It was at once subpar TV journalism – Winfrey softballed and gaped like an office gossip on a work break – and undeniable TV history: a torpedoing of the British monarchy for the Zoom generation. Later, Prince Philip’s funeral was conducted without crowds in resonant Covid stillness. Comedy-wise, Aisling Bea’s This Way Up resurfaced on needle-sharp form, and also from Channel 4, there was a fresh newcomer, We Are Lady Parts (all hail female Muslim punk bands!). Amazon Prime, meanwhile, delivered the patchy, innovative Kevin Can F**k Himself. Included in my Top 10 picks, Sterlin Harjo and Taika Waititi’s Reservation Dogs (Disney+) showcased Oklahoman reservation life; Murray Bartlett and Jennifer Coolidge were every kind of glorious in Sky Atlantic’s whip-smart dramedy The White Lotus. And thanks to Sophie Willan’s ingenious, hilarious Alma’s Not Normal (BBC Two), Bolton is now, and for ever more, my cultural capital of the year. In drama, Line of Duty (BBC One) and Succession (Sky Atlantic) returned, weaving a tad, but still landing punches. Standout turns included Celine Buckens and Tracy Ifeachor in Showtrial (BBC One), while Gabrielle Creevy emerged from series two of BBC Three’s magnificent, poignant Wales-based In My Skin as an actor to watch. There were career-best performances from Sean Bean and Stephen Graham (Time), Kate Winslet (Mare of Easttown), Olivia Colman (Landscapers) and Lesley Manville, in I Am… Maria (Channel 4). Tahar Rahim was sinister in BBC One’s exceptional The Serpent, while Colin Farrell exuded paunchy menace in BBC Two’s undervalued The North Water. And, of course, there was our TV pinnacle of 2021, Channel 4’s 1980s Aids-drama It’s a Sin, Russell T Davies’s bruised, sparkling, tragicomic tour de force. What’s left to say, but: Olly Alexander, you are everything. Disappointment? That ending of Netflix’s Behind Her Eyes (no spoilers, but what a swizz!). There was a fond goodbye to Nicola Walker’s DI Cassie Stuart in ITV’s Unforgotten, and a wary hello to GB News, the “TV channel” (recollections may vary) that, last time I checked, appeared to have morphed into an anti-woke snuff movie starring a pint-sinking zombie called Nigel.

12/27/2021,"Voters have moved on from Brexit and are now more focused on electing MPs away from the “cheese and wine” Westminster bubble, the new MP for North Shropshire has said after her historic byelection victory. Helen Morgan said the Liberal Democrats’ win, which overturned a Conservative majority of nearly 23,000, was no fluke and that her party is capable of winning over more voters than people expect.  Speaking during her first few days in the new job, Morgan said her election builds on the party’s success in the Chesham and Amersham byelection in June, where they also took a former Tory safe seat in a shock result. “We’ve won two big byelections in just over six months. We’ve now proved the Chesham and Amersham result wasn’t a fluke,” she said. “Everyone said that was about HS2, but in North Shropshire it was about issues that affect everyone in the country. I think it proves we can make a difference across a much wider area than people thought we might be able to.” She said the Lib Dems, who campaigned strongly against Brexit, have proved their popularity is no longer confined to parts of the country which voted Remain – Shropshire voted to leave the EU by 56.9%. “The electorate has moved on and it seems to me that they recognise that voting for a Liberal Democrat who’s very rooted in community politics, who is focused on listening, is a massive contrast to this Westminster Conservative bubble where they go to cheese and wine parties after work,” Morgan said. Revelations in the Guardian that Boris Johnson and 17 staff had a gathering in the Downing Street garden during the first pandemic lockdown prompted fury. Now that the dust has settled from the election result, Morgan, a former financial controller and parish councillor who moved to North Shropshire seven years ago, said she has had chance to reflect on the mammoth journey the party embarked on to secure their win against the odds. A key factor was the amount of time and resource they poured into the campaign, and how quickly their activists got on the ground. “Owen Paterson resigned on the Thursday, and we were delivering leaflets on Saturday morning, even though we hadn’t selected a candidate at that point,” she said. “We got 20,000 leaflets out over that first weekend and I think that enabled us to say to the people here: ‘We are the challengers and we really want to take this seriously.’” Although they knew early on that things were moving in their favour, Morgan said she was never quite sure they had done enough to win. “I’m not sure at the beginning we would have expected to turn around a 22,000 Conservative majority but we thought we could get really close,” she said. “I never allowed myself to imagine myself as the next MP, I just kept plugging away at the campaign. When it all came together on the last day, it’s quite overwhelming. Obviously, I was thrilled, but there’s a great sense of responsibility that comes with it.” Much post-election analysis had focused on the impact of the Downing Street Christmas parties scandal, as well as the degree of tactical voting among Labour and Green supporters. While Morgan admits these were key factors, she says it was the Lib Dem offer, and their relentless campaigning, that won the seat. “I think it would be a bit unfair to the voters to say it was all about anger over the parties,” she said. “And there’s a lot of talk about tactical voting, but you can’t win a seat like this that was 60% Conservative last time round unless you persuade traditional conservative voters to switch to you.” She said there were multiple issues, including anger at ambulance waiting times and concerns among the farming community, which helped swing the vote in her favour. “There’s a palpable sense of anger among farmers around the trade deals; they’ve created a real moment of danger for British farming,” she said, adding the industry had also been badly hit by Covid. “We’ve had people pouring milk down the drains, which is completely unsustainable. I think there’s a definite sense that Boris Johnson just really doesn’t care about the farming sector.” In her election speech, Morgan launched a blistering attack on the government, describing Johnson’s rule as a “nightly soap opera of calamity and chaos”. It’s the “absence of leadership from government” that is mainly hurting the Conservatives on the ground, she said. “I think people are crying out for somebody to say: ‘This is what we’re going to do and we’re going to lead from the front,’ and it’s absent.”",News/Politics,‘It wasn’t a fluke’: North Shropshire MP Helen Morgan on byelection win,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/27/it-wasnt-a-fluke-north-shropshire-mp-helen-morgan-on-byelection-win
