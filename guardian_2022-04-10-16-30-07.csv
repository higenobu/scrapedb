4/10/2022,"During the furore about who picked up the bill for the lavish makeover of the prime minister’s flat, the chancellor’s people made a big thing of declaring that there was no risk of Rishi Sunak generating a stink such as wallpapergate. The Treasury released a statement pointedly letting it be known that Mr Sunak had paid for the refurbishment of his family quarters in Downing Street from his own deep pockets. Shortly afterwards, an admiring Tory MP chuckled to me: “Rishi is rich enough to buy his wallpaper himself.” After the many tawdry episodes associated with Boris Johnson, the idea that his next-door neighbour was scandal-free recommended Mr Sunak to Tory MPs as their next leader. The contrast between the two men – a cash-grubbing prime minister splattered with sleaze versus a chancellor advertising himself as the squeaky-clean, family man – also made Mr Sunak the more attractive figure to voters. Although that was only a short time ago, it seems like ancient history. That was before the public was outraged to learn that his wife, Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian billionaire, has been using non-domicile status to avoid paying UK taxes on her massive overseas earnings. It transpires that the chancellor is truly a believer in lower taxes – so long as they are for his own family. The first response to the uproar from Mr Sunak, his wife and their apologists was to protest that she was breaking no laws by exploiting this tax break for the mega-rich. That was revealing about them in itself, because it so spectacularly failed to understand why people would be angry even if the arrangement was legal. Some of the public may resent the great wealth of the Sunaks, some may admire it, some may care a lot that they enjoy stratospheric riches way beyond the dreams of most Britons and some may care not a bit. Nearly all of the public will have had a reasonable expectation that the Sunaks followed the tax rules that apply to the typical voter. The chancellor’s family’s fortune being shielded from his tax collectors would smell rotten in any circumstances. The current context made it absolutely toxic. He is ratcheting up the taxes on tens of millions of Britons with modest incomes who have no choice but to pay up. He responded to criticism of his recent spring statement by arguing that the Treasury did not have the funds to do much to alleviate the cost of living crunch on poorer households. Only for everyone to learn that there would be more money in the kitty if the chancellor’s wife paid tax in the way most people do. It was the morality, stupid. It was the inequity. It was the unfairness. For an Instagram politician who is an obsessive curator of his personal image, it took the chancellor a remarkably long time to grasp how untenable this was. The Sunaks initially even tried to persuade us that they deserved not to be the target of fury, but objects of sympathy. You needed your smallest violin to accompany his lament that the couple were the victims of a “political hit job”. In one notably self-pitying interview, the chancellor went so far as to claim that his opponents were attempting “to smear my wife” in order to “get at me”. It is true that he has enemies, the biggest of whom is not sitting in a newspaper office or on the opposition benches, but living next door at Number 10. Regardless of the origins of the leak and the motives of the leaker, there is no “smear” in discussing whether it is right for the chancellor’s wife to take advantage of a tax scheme unavailable to the vast majority of Britons. The storm had been raging for 48 hours before Mr Sunak fully grasped how career-endangering this had become. The couple issued a statement in the name of his wife that made a nonsense of their previous assertions about why she has not been paying UK taxes on her overseas earnings. The statement announced she would be doing so in future, claiming now to “understand and appreciate the British sense of fairness”. That was the minimum necessary to try to contain the damage to her husband’s reputation before it was irreparably broken. It had been striking how very few Conservative MPs were willing to put themselves in front of a microphone to defend him. A growing number of Tories had been privately saying that Mr Sunak could not remain at the Treasury if his wife didn’t change her tax status. The chancellor will be hoping that they have retreated to a position that is more sustainable, but there are still outstanding questions about the family’s tax affairs which the media and the opposition will continue to press. There has been no promise to pay the very large sums, which some estimates put at £20m, she has saved from the arrangement over the past decade. It will be legitimately asked: if it is right and fair that she pays UK tax on her overseas income in future, isn’t it right and fair that she makes good on the tax swerved in the past? Questions will also persist about Mr Sunak’s character and judgment. It will be even more of an issue whether a super-rich chancellor can be the man to persuade less affluent Britons that they will have to endure hard times. Even some Tories raised their eyebrows when the Sunaks made a donation of more than £100,000 to his old school, Winchester College, at a time when he is denying state schools the resources they say they need. Asked recently to name the price of a loaf, he channelled Marie Antoinette when he answered: “We all have different breads in our house.” Houses would have been a more accurate answer, because they own at least four properties in the UK and abroad as well as having the use of two government residences, the Downing Street flat and Dorneywood in Buckinghamshire. Colleagues have boggled that the Sunaks judged this to be the right time to be spending loads of money on a swimming pool, tennis court and gym complex at their manor house in his Yorkshire constituency. It’s maybe not the best look for a chancellor jacking up taxes amid the most severe squeeze on real incomes in decades. There’s much debate among Tories about why the chancellor failed to appreciate that his wife’s tax position was bound to cause uproar. Is it because he is so rich or because his political instincts are so poor that he could not see how this would look through the eyes of the electorate? Did he understand that it would look terrible, but foolishly assumed that it could be kept hidden? Did he expect it to be revealed one day, but gambled that it wouldn’t trigger an outcry? Did he anticipate an outcry, but reckoned he could brazen it out? Was he naive, idiotic, complacent, cavalier or arrogant? His popularity went up like a rocket during the pandemic. Now it is coming down like a stick. His approval ratings, once the envy of every other politician at Westminster, were already tumbling. In our latest Opinium poll, they have fallen further to a record low score of minus 15. Among Tory members, the most authoritative survey of their views of ministers suggests that he has plummeted from top of their pops to third from bottom. This will be greeted with the salty tears of a grinning crocodile next door at Number 10. In terms of the jostling for power within the Tory hierarchy, anything that hurts the chancellor is regarded as helpful to the prime minister. The self-inflicted wounding of the man who was, until very recently, his likeliest successor will make Mr Johnson feel more secure in the premiership. Which also means that this is surely further bad news for the Tory party’s standing with the public. The two most senior members of the government have now scandalised the country. Partygate came about because so many of the inhabitants of Number 10 thought that they were free to flout the Covid restrictions imposed on everyone else and were encouraged to behave atrociously by having a boss with a career history of shameless rule-breaking. A similar sense of entitlement led the chancellor and his wife to decide that there was nothing wrong with avoiding paying UK tax on a huge portion of their vast family income. There’s a pattern to the behaviour of this government. Its leaders demand painful sacrifices of everyone else while claiming special privileges for themselves. There’s one rule for them. There’s another for the little people. That’s how they act because that’s how they think.

4/10/2022,"Ihave always found the conventions of how gardening is talked about on TV weirdly fascinating. Not only because it is all so different from how I and my friends think about gardening, but also because I wonder if the approach taken, born largely out of a desire to broaden its commercial appeal, paradoxically hampers our ability to reach people. Let’s just imagine, for a minute, what would happen if the presenters of food TV shows talked like those of garden TV… First you’d have your obligatory “jobs for the week”, which would be a seasonal reminder of all the little chores you had to do around your kitchen, starting off with detailed advice on how to defrost your freezer. Showing the one “proper” way to do this, it would end with a reminder that it had to be repeated at least once every six months. There’d be a lengthy segment on the best way to peel an onion next, followed by tips on how to reorganise your spice rack. Actually, wait, that’s not quite right. They wouldn’t be described as simple tips to make things easier, they would be called “rules”, implying that if you, for whatever reason, didn’t memorise and follow them to the letter, everything would fall apart. Then would come the recipes, but these wouldn’t be an exploration of ideas and ingredients from cultures all over the world. No, they’d be traditional staples, like cottage pie or parsley sauce, sticking to rigidly established formulas, based on the idea that cooking reached its zenith in Victorian Britain. They’d be long sunlit shots of archaic kitchen tools, presenters wearing period chef’s outfits and quite a lot of “Britain has led the world in cooking” peppered throughout. If you find this analogy getting tenuous, check out how often things like scythes and tweed waistcoats are featured non-ironically in 21st-century gardening media, and how little any gardening innovation after, say, 1950 is featured. Oh, and before I forget, these recipes would be on a cycle. So every year around the same time, the same collection of dishes would feature in loose rotation. Because after all, you can’t assume viewers would have learned anything from previous episodes and might want to explore a new slant. To make things accessible to beginners, they’d have to treat everyone like perpetual newbies. Every year at Easter there would be wall-to-wall egg recipes. But not Heston making some kind of liquid nitrogen creation or Ken Hom looking at century eggs in China. All presenters would make virtually identical segments on how to boil one. Every year. For ever. If you are a young person, this might sound ridiculous. But those of us of a certain age will remember that, back in the 1980s, prior to trailblazers like Keith Floyd who shattered this rigid, traditionalist, instruction-manual mould, food shows were quite like this. A list of pre-measured ingredients would scroll up the screen, showing you how to make stuff like (I kid you not) cheese on toast over a painfully drawn out 15 minutes. They weren’t even called “food” shows either, but “cookery” shows, reflecting the focus exclusively on the process, not the enjoyment of it. Thank goodness that all changed in food TV-land, opening the joy of cooking (and eating) to people it never could reach before. Hopefully one day it’ll be garden telly’s turn.

4/10/2022,"It is, they always say, a short playing career, and you need to make your money while you can – an observation about professional football that was perhaps more relevant in the days when retired strikers might be found running a struggling pub or cabbing in the early hours than now, when the likes of Ronaldo, Messi and Neymar bestride the grassy sward. The midfielder Steve Hodge belongs more to the former era than that of the Midas-age players whose revenue from image rights and endorsements alone would keep them in gold taps and gigantic watches for the rest of their lives – indeed, even Hodge’s most lucrative transfer, from Nottingham Forest to Leeds United in 1991, didn’t break the million-pound barrier. But Hodge made one exceptionally brilliant business decision, on a day that he might not otherwise have deemed his finest. In 1986, in the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City and the quarter-final of the World Cup, he swapped shirts with Diego Maradona. Those of us inexorably heading towards our free bus passes will remember the agony of that day, England’s 2-1 defeat not merely painful but cosmically unjust, the first of Maradona’s two goals scored courtesy, as the Argentinian so tauntingly, so hubristically put it, with help from the hand of God. Did the fact that Hodge’s misfired flick set up that infamous goal spur him on? Did he think: sod it, I might as well get something out of this crappy day? Well, now he has: possibly, indeed, £4m, if estimates of what the shirt will fetch when it is auctioned by Sotheby’s in May are to be believed. A nice nest egg for Hodge, who clearly realised he had something special when he entitled his 2010 memoir The Man with Maradona’s Shirt. Although it was not ever thus: in 2002, my husband was working on Johnny Vaughan’s World Cup Extra television programme, and the team invited Hodge to appear on the show to display the keepsake. The player, a few years into retirement, arrived carrying a flimsy Tesco carrier bag from which he produced the hallowed relic. My husband remembers three things: that the supermarket livery set off the blue of the Argentinian strip beautifully; that he immediately dispatched a junior member of the team to buy a presentation case for the purposes of televisual aesthetics; and that he advised Hodge to get the item insured, sharpish. Not that I’m saying we’re due a cut, mind. Naturally, when global fame and the prospect of vast amounts of money collide, the row rises. Maradona’s daughter has claimed it’s not the right shirt – that Hodge in fact has the top her dad wore in the first half, in which no goals were scored, with or without divine intervention. Sotheby’s counters that it has carried out rigorous and scientific checks in order to authenticate it (what might they be? Sweat analysis? Mud samples? Febreze?). As to the whereabouts of the real thing, her lips are sealed, she says, in order to protect the owner of the One True Shirt. It is as though Dan Brown were rewriting Roy of the Rovers. Jingoistic it might be, but I feel cheerfully well disposed towards Hodge’s midlife payday, not least because he’d had a ferociously good tournament until then and, let’s face it, nobody talks about his cross to Lineker against Poland. And he spent quite a bit of his playing career putting up with Brian Clough. And, obviously, because it was a bloody handball. The question of whether actually owning such a garment, or even being in close proximity to it, confers greatness, is a little more dubious. The absence of the wearer – now, alas, a permanent absence, since Maradona left us for the divot-free penalty area in the sky – is a stumbling block, for sure, as the Duchess of Cornwall pointed out last week when she was shown the very shirt that Colin Firth wore in the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Again, it wasn’t so much the piece of clothing as the fact that Firth was pictured dripping wet and brooding inside it that turned a nation on to the joys of Jane Austen. “But he’s not in it, that’s a bit sad,” said Camilla, and who could disagree?",Sport/Football,I’ll bet someone else’s shirt that Diego Maradona’s is real…,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/10/ill-bet-someone-elses-shirt-that-diego-maradonas-is-real
4/10/2022,"Recently, I took some time off and was shocked at how much work I found workless life to be. I had to ease myself into the empty days as if a swimming pool. So morbidly institutionalised have I become that without a routine imposed upon a week, I realised I’d have to create my own. I started jogging in the morning, strapping my little body up in a variety of sweatshirts and hurling it through the woods to try and control my headaches, a little further every day, listening to dirty podcasts as a background to the green and perfect light. I learned that, for all its many horrors, the secret to running is putting one foot in front of the other, even when it’s dull and painful, and simply carrying on. Back at home I became ravenous in a new way, requiring a breakfast starter, breakfast main and breakfast pudding. I grew to know the gaping period between school and dinner time in a way I never had when working in the office, those hours from half-three to half-six, when, if one hasn’t planned carefully, a combination of exhaustion and homework digs a pit in the afternoon and invites children to sit inside it shouting. I witnessed it, daily. I took up weekly pottery classes with my mum, merrily chucking together a variety of, let’s call them “objects”? As the weeks passed I was able to lie in bed on a sunny afternoon and read a book about murder. In the evenings I watched a Netflix show with my daughter called Is It Cake? where bakers compete to trick a panel of judges by creating sculptural desserts that look uncannily like, perhaps, a shoe. But a lot of the time, a lot of my time off, I was thinking about work. I did not miss the fluorescent lights, which goaded my migraines as if boys on a bus, but I did miss putting on a jazzy outfit and I did miss the feeling I was part of something. I thought about what work is, what it does, what it does for me, what it’s for, what it has become. Millions across the world were wondering, too, either unemployed or adrift since the pandemic hit and seeing the new rawness of working life – the way our jobs have been classified as essential or non, the way homeworking transforms a home, the rising costs of living compared with static salaries, our contentment levels at 7pm. After a period of grinding ambition, where busyness was currency and a lack of secure jobs led to a generation of young people deciding their brand identity before they’d chosen their A Levels, is a change coming? In my early teens it was cool to do nothing. Effort was embarrassing. Heroes lay smoking on beanbags, damning the man well into the evening. By the time I was of employable age, though, that malingering impulse had become vulgar. The biggest taboo was to admit you didn’t particularly want to work. By the time social media controlled the world, work was life, the clearest example being the influencer economy, illustrated by women who earned cash by broadcasting themselves, for example, opening presents while thin. And while it was a simpler job than say, being a teacher, at least in the evenings teachers got to go home. Off work, I started to question the things I’d taken for granted throughout my adult life. Was it worth working every day, for money, for recognition, to shore up an identity? Or could I live on less, could I bear to live like this, to spend more time with only myself to talk to over tea? I love my work. But how much of my life should it control? Is all work all-important, or – is it cake? I pictured the Netflix host wielding his knife, holding it for a beat too long before bringing it down upon full-time work, and the studio’s gasps as it cut through icing, sponge, jam. At the cinema one afternoon, I looked around to see not just the usual retired couples and their shared bags of Revels, but younger people, too, alone at a matinee. I was leaning into my holiday by then, rolling my freedom around my tongue like a mint, and I liked it. And I liked the thought that one impact of these fraught and wobbly years might be a return to slackerdom. To less trying hard, to more caring less. Even if it’s not entirely possible for those burdened by childcare, rent or rising bills, an attitude shift alone could start chipping away at these laboured structures, built on blunt ambition and the self-righteous glamour of striving. As those ground down by their unappreciated efforts to “self-optimise” give up the fight, and those who saw the pandemic chew the meat of their jobs down to white bone decide to reshape their lives around something other than work, bring on the beanbags. Bring on the slow but daily plod. Instead of sprinting towards a goal, I am starting to understand the benefits of simply putting one foot in front of the other. Of gently carrying on.

4/10/2022,"Today’s Brexit Conservatives will hate the comparison, but there are inconvenient parallels between their domestic agenda and Hungary’s newly elected, self-confessed apostle of democratic illiberalism, Viktor Orbán, French uber-nationalist and anti-immigrant Marine Le Pen and Poland’s murky Law and Justice party. All trumpet a boastful nationalism and disregard international law, all aim to create a hostile climate for immigrants, all believe the electoral system should be manipulated for their advantage, all distrust a pluralist media, all want to limit dissent and expand summary policing powers, all incline to traditional views about sexuality and the family and, to varying degrees, all are climate change deniers. All habitually dissimulate and even lie; criticism is fake news. The Johnson government’s police, nationality and borders and election bills come from these same rightwing, anti-Enlightenment, illiberal roots, as does its assault on public service broadcasting and, of course, the big beast of them all, Brexit. Paradoxically, Brexit Toryism is very European – if Europe at its worst. Yet for the mainstream centre and liberal left the threat is that electorates, far from caring about this retreat from openness and democracy into nationalist, anti-democratic closure, happily collude with it, even vote for it. Orbán emphatically won two-thirds of the vote in Hungary last Sunday as war raged in Ukraine, even if aided and abetted by a rigged media and voting system. Similarly, French voters, having briefly rallied to President Emmanuel Macron as war leader, are now inclining to Le Pen, who is expected to run him a close second in the first round of the presidential election today. In the final runoff on 24 April, the pollsters are saying the result is too close to call – even if Macron is still considered to be just ahead. What’s going on? One factor is the impact of globalisation on advanced economies’ economic and social structures, captured by the famous “elephant curve” depicting how globalisation has influenced global income distribution over the decades. The curve in the middle is the relative improvement of incomes in many medium-income countries, particularly of their middle class, who have been helped as their countries catch up with richer neighbours. The elephant’s long, drooping tail is the continuing disadvantage faced by the world’s poor, the downward sloping of the trunk is what has happened to the incomes of the mass of workers in industrialised countries, while the last triumphant upward curve of the U-shaped trunk describes the ever lusher incomes of the elite – globalisation’s unchallenged beneficiaries. When ordinary French voters, at the wrong end of this global phenomenon, accuse Macron of being the president of the rich, this is what they mean. But the political ramifications are not playing out traditionally, as the French elections show. Voters may want to vent their anger on the unfairness, but rather than look to a fragmented left for reform and an affirmation of social solidarities, they are tempted by explanations that blame foreigners’ incursions into their national space and many believe that illiberal, quasi-racist patriotism offers the best response. Le Pen is a brilliant exponent. France knows her time-honoured hostility to immigrants and especially Muslims, but criss-crossing France on her presidential campaign she has emphasised how her “patriotic” economic policies favouring small business and local producers will mean independence from foreigners, more jobs and lower prices. She has abandoned talking about France leaving the EU – the self-defeating nature of Brexit is obvious even to her – which has helped her court mainstream voters, aided by having an even more extravagant anti-immigrant candidate, Éric Zemmour, on her right adding to her apparent new reasonableness. But she remains toxic. She is an “organicist”, seeing French society as “a living being threatened by foreign bodies”, as Ivanne Trippenbach and Franck Johannès wrote in Le Monde last week. Her project is to regenerate organic French society by privileging pure French nationals. This will involve a constitutional coup – rewriting the constitution with its roots in the 1789 revolution, suspending much EU law and withdrawing from the European convention on human rights. “Politics,” she says, “comes before law.” Moreover, her economic programme is unworkable. Her election would split France, stop its economic resurgence in its tracks, unleash racist demons and transfix the EU. France’s left, like Britain’s, has had to perform a difficult straddling act. It needed to keep its lines open to the disconcerted centre with its worries about crime and immigration, while challenging capitalism’s worst proclivities, as well as affirm its commitment to strong social support and above all assert its belief in the best of Enlightenment values. It has failed calamitously, in part because of its own endemic divisions and in part because Macron made a better pitch to the centre. But Macron is discovering, as Tony Blair did in Britain, that you cannot govern just as a centrist. Durable governing coalitions are of the centre and centre-left or centre and centre-right, otherwise there is no organising governing political philosophy or sufficient electoral ballast. Macron is in difficulty because he has jettisoned too much of the left. He has a fortnight to reclaim that ground and build a durable coalition. Yet Ukraine’s incredible stand against Vladimir Putin’s criminal war – and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s eloquent appeals to the best of what Europe and the west must stand for – is a game-changer. It has not only relegitimised the EU and brought it together – it is a forceful call to all western electorates about where illiberalism, uber-nationalism and suppression lead. Blaming foreigners, appealing to a mystic conception of your country and trying to transmute you and your party into unchallenged masters of the state lead to what is happening in Ukraine. The centre and centre-left – in Britain, in France, indeed everywhere in Europe – have to make that case, along with feasible if aggressive programmes that make capitalism work for the common good. It is time to reassert the best of ourselves and it falls to Macron over the next fortnight to find the words, energy, his moderate left-of-centre roots and the elan to do just that.

4/10/2022,"A major Tate Britain exhibition opening this month will be the first to display a rare early self-portrait of Walter Sickert, the influential English painter, that shows how his early career on the stage drove his ever-changing art. The string of self-portraits includes a small pen and ink sketch from 1882, found in Islington’s Local History Centre, in which the artist leans forward in a pose taken from his idol, the actor-manager Henry Irving. Sickert, born in 1860, had joined Irving’s stage company in his youth as a performer, before leaving to study art at the Slade School in 1881. “The self-portraits are a revealing look at the different ways Sickert saw himself,” said Tate assistant curator Thomas Kennedy, ahead of the retrospective show, which marks 80 years since the artist’s death. Sickert’s habit of playing with identities, and of dropping into contrasting elements of Victorian nightlife, also gave him a sinister reputation that experts believe he does not deserve. His crime scenes and unglamorous depiction of nudes, both shocking in his day, were simply a symptom of his curiosity about the city around him and not evidence of the artist’s moral depravity. Infamously, Sickert’s four paintings of the Camden Town murder of 1907 led the American novelist Patricia Cornwell to argue he was actually Jack the Ripper. But this theory has been widely discredited. And, as Kennedy points out, the Camden murder took place just around the corner from Sickert’s north London home, while his interest in Jack the Ripper was one shared by most Victorians. “Sickert was almost playing up to it,” said Kennedy. “He was very interested in Jack the Ripper, but so was everyone else.” Matthew Sturgis, who wrote an acclaimed biography of the artist in 2005, also regards the Ripper slur as “nonsense”. “It was an unfortunate conflation of events of Sickert’s own murder painting, and then the story told to him by his landlady in Mornington Crescent that the Ripper had lodged there 20 years ago.” In fact, the artist was in France when the Ripper struck in 1888. The influence of French impressionists on his portraits of nudes was scandalous at the time. While such pictures were common across the Channel, particularly in the work of Degas, the friend who most influenced Sickert, and Bonnard, Britain remained in a prudish pre-Raphaelite phase, depicting women as angels, or as a Venus emerging from the waves. Sickert much preferred realism. “He was reacting against the idealised nude,” says Sturgis. “He thought the British approach to the subject was too polite and too concerned with status. Remember, too, that Sickert saw himself as a perpetual enfant terrible.” Kennedy argues that the artist also had a radically sophisticated approach to newspaper coverage and was often inspired by stories, including those about himself. “We have another work from the National Portrait Gallery, Self-Portrait in Grisaille (1935), which shows how self-aware he was. It is based on a 1932 photograph of Sickert, looking old, arriving at the Royal Academy of Arts on Piccadilly to see his own work,” he said. “The idea that artists only started playing with public images of themselves in recent times is wrong. Sickert was doing it 60 or 70 years before.” This interest in news reflected in art was controversial at the time, but in an interview for the Pall Mall Gazette titled The Gospel of Impressionism, Sickert made his position clear: “We don’t go back to other days,” the artist said. “Our history is of today.” But it was the stage, and the chance to pretend, that was perhaps the key influence on his work. One self-portrait, The Juvenile Lead, shows Sickert in the role of an English intellectual, while in his The Bust of Tom Sayers: a Self-Portrait (1913-15), he poses in a beard next to a marble bust of a celebrated Victorian bare-knuckle fighter. “Did he dye his facial hair and leave his bushy eyebrows untrimmed, or has he pasted on a false beard and eyebrows for a bit of make-believe?” asks the Sickert expert Anna Gruetzner Robins. “Until his old age Sickert continued to be a consummate performer who loved to appear in fresh disguises and had a bewildering number of ways of speaking and behaving. Those who knew him claimed that it was impossible to discover the man behind his many personas and egos,” she says. “We don’t know why he stopped acting but we do know he admired performers,” said Kennedy. “These personas he adopted were almost emulating music hall performers in paint.” During the 1880s and 1890s, venues for variety shows were under moral scrutiny. Critics accused them of being dens of vice, but Sickert repeatedly visited and painted them, in particular the Bedford, which opened in 1861 and stood between Arlington Street and Camden High Street. “It was the transformative power of performance – that ephemeral moment when the audience gives itself over to the performer and becomes lost in their song – that truly enthralled him,” writes the art historian Billy Rough in his catalogue essay The Much-Abused Apostle of Music Hall Art: Sickert and the Stage.",Arts/Art and design,Walter Sickert painted himself in many roles … but not Jack the Ripper,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/10/walter-sickert-tate-britain-retrospective-victorian-artist
4/10/2022,"Back in the early 1990s, while covering the filming of the bizarre Russian-backed, Ukraine-set horror movie Dark Waters, I spent 17 hours on a midnight train from Moscow to Odesa. To this day I can still vividly recall the noise, smell and claustrophobia of that journey, crammed into a damp, four-bunk berth with tiny corridors whose windows were sealed shut, leading to toilets that were best avoided. All those memories came rushing back as I watched Compartment No 6, a 1990s-set drama in which a young woman boards a Moscow train heading the other way – up towards the port city of Murmansk. The film’s trajectory may be north rather than south, and the timescale far longer than my trip, but the expression on Finnish actor Seidi Haarla’s face as she enters the titular compartment had that same mix of horror and resignation that I remember so well. Haarla plays Laura, a Finnish student who has been living in Moscow with Irina (Dinara Drukarova), an academic with whom she has fallen in love. Together, they booked a trip to see the Kanozero petroglyphs, ancient rock drawings that date back to the third millennium BC. But Irina’s schedule changed and she encouraged Laura to go alone, leaving her to share a sleeper cabin not with her lover but a stranger, Russian miner Ljoha (Yuriy Borisov). Laura and Ljoha are chalk and cheese, almost caricatured representatives of their respective nations. He is gruff, often drunk and aggressively impolite, asking if she is going to Murmansk to work as a prostitute. She is aloof, looking down disapprovingly from the top bunk as he fills the cabin with his booze and cigarette smoke. At first it seems that their confinement may lead to some form of violence – that one of them might not make it to their destination. But as the journey progresses, a form of social perestroika starts to occur. Gradually they find common ground beneath the alien surfaces as the cold war between them begins to thaw. Finnish director Juho Kuosmanen, who made the melancholy boxing romance The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mäki, has described Compartment No 6 (which is loosely adapted from a novel by Rosa Liksom) as “an Arctic road movie that takes place in a train”. Shot largely within the confines of a real Russian train, the film brilliantly captures the authentic air of its setting, placing the audience right there in that strange liminal space between stasis and motion, an environment that strikes a chord with both its central characters. Despite her declaration that she longs to be back in Irina’s bohemian apartment in Moscow, flashbacks to Laura’s life there show her as a fish out of water. Increasingly, it becomes clear that she only embarked on this gruelling cross-country trip in an attempt to fit in with her lover’s life. As for Ljoha, beneath his brash exterior lurks a painful recognition that Laura can only be his companion – for better or worse – for the duration of this journey. Alongside David Lean’s British classic Brief Encounter and Wolfgang Petersen’s German masterpiece Das Boot, Kuosmanen cites Karim Aïnouz’s 2019 sisterly love story The Invisible Life of Eurídice Guasmão and Sofia Coppola’s Lost in Translation as key influences. I also saw deadpan echoes of Jim Jarmusch’s US indie road movie Stranger Than Paradise, in which Richard Edson’s Eddie famously remarked: “It’s funny – you come to someplace new and everything looks just the same.” While Compartment No 6 may take place on the other side of the world, its bittersweet conclusion is similar; wherever you go, it’s not the arrival but the journey that matters. Beautifully believable performances from Haarla and Borisov add emotional weight, rivalling the nuanced naturalistic charm of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in Richard Linklater’s Before trilogy. As for any wider message, the film’s central theme of overcoming otherness and finding common ground across personal, cultural and geographical borders seems like a balm for the soul in these tumultuous times.",Arts/Film,Compartment No 6 review – bittersweet brief encounter on an Arctic-bound train,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/10/compartment-no-6-review-bittersweet-brief-encounter-on-an-arctic-bound-train
4/10/2022,"It’s the early 1970s, a time when the Carpenters are playing on the radio, the Milk Tray man epitomises sophistication and, in the small town outside Belfast where teacher Cushla Lavery lives with her mother, bombings and beatings fill the headlines. At 24, she is able to recall a time before the Troubles, unlike her class of seven-year-olds at the Catholic primary school, whose vocabularies already include words such as gelignite and internment. Theirs is a “mixed” town, but community relations teeter on a knife edge. At the family’s pub, run by Cushla’s brother, Eamonn, Paras pointedly grind their cigarette butts out in the carpet and the “ould lads” propping up the bar reminisce about the second world war, “because this war was unspeakable”. In Trespasses, her first novel, acclaimed short-story writer Louise Kennedy sets herself the challenge of encapsulating those unspeakable times and the powerlessness felt by ordinary people caught in the crossfire. She does so with skill, combining unflinching authenticity with narrative dexterity and a flair for detail, all wrapped up in a moving love story – two, really. The first tracks Cushla’s affair with Michael Agnew, an older, married Protestant; the second her involvement in the home life of bullied pupil Davy McGeown, whose earnest goofiness steals her heart. Over the course of spring and summer, these two distinct plotlines converge to devastating effect. Kennedy, a fiftysomething former chef, spent much of her childhood in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. She makes potent symbolic use of visual details, capturing, for instance, the mothers waiting outside school, their “umbrellas touching like a badly made quilt”, and her idiomatic dialogue gives her prose real verve. Cushla’s mother, the gin-soaked Gina, has a particularly fine line in insults: Helen Mirren, seen on a TV chatshow, is a “dirty article”. Cushla herself, though self-conscious in the company of Michael’s accomplished friends, speaks with a perfect blend of tough humour and vulnerable sincerity. “The state of it,” she says, as they drive past the much-bombed Europa hotel. Michael, meanwhile, becomes a handy mouthpiece for setting the Troubles in historical context. He also voices the sheer claustrophobia of living in a world where you’re defined first and foremost by religious affiliation. “It’s not about what you do here,” he reminds Cushla, “it’s about what you are.” Sure enough, circumstances will leave her acts of well-intentioned kindness to Davy’s family looking as twisted as barbed wire. Trespasses is framed by an encounter that takes place decades later. Cushla, now elderly and still surprised by the fact, stands contemplating a sculpture commemorating a friend of the artist, murdered in the Troubles, when a hand reaches out to touch her arm. Though restitution is all but impossible, together the sculpture and the chance meeting provide a sense of resolution. It’s a scene as deftly calibrated as the drama that precedes it.

4/10/2022,"Gardens knit us into the cycles of life: every winter is a preparation for more permanent losses, every spring a reminder of the possibility for renewal ahead. Lulah Ellender began writing Grounding after her mother’s death; sorting through the family home, she found a diary that her mother kept recording the rhythms of her gardening year and this becomes a guide for her own engagement with her garden. Ellender realises that her garden – as a physical space and as a way of being – represents a point of communion with her mother, a way of keeping in touch with her via the mediums of plants and flowers. “Her tasks are my tasks now,” she writes. The book begins with Ellender and her family – a husband and four children, all of them unnamed – at a turning point in their lives. They rent a house in a Sussex town (also unnamed, but probably Lewes) and their landlord has just died. There is a legal wrangle over the property: one party wishes to evict the tenants, the other wants them to stay. At first, Ellender feels defeated. The house is where she and her husband have raised their children. The large garden is a place of beauty and refuge (even if, as she says later, “to tend this garden is to engage in a constant struggle not to be overwhelmed”). The possibility of losing their home calls up an earlier loss – of the West Country farmhouse in which Ellender grew up and from which she was exiled when “my parents split up, my father went bust and we had to move out”. Grounding is the record of a summer tending the garden with a fervency that is a “modest and quiet act of defiance”, making the place beautiful even though it may no longer be hers to enjoy when the cosmos seeds she has planted burst into flower. The book moves from the spring to the autumn equinox, recording both the specifics of Ellender’s battles with rambling roses and a garden that is divided too distinctly between sun and shade and a broader consideration of why so many of us spend such a large portion of our lives tending our gardens. “In creating a garden, part of us is trying to recapture something of the dreamlike quality of being a child outdoors,” she writes at one point in a glorious chapter on childhood and gardens. I’ve read a lot of gardening books – if my summers are spent in the garden, my winters are all about gardening books and seed catalogues – but I’ve read very few as moving and literary as Grounding. Ellender lives close to a host of wonderful gardens and writes beautifully about Charleston and Monk’s House (she notes that the Bloomsbury set were also renters of their country properties), about Sissinghurst and Great Dixter. We find here many of the great garden writers – Christopher Lloyd and Vita Sackville-West, Sue Stuart-Smith and Mirabel Osler – but there’s also Tove Ditlevsen and Jorge Luis Borges, Helen Simpson and Katherine Mansfield. We understand that these writers are part of the garden for Ellender, shaping the way she sees it. As the end of the summer – and Ellender’s potential eviction – approaches, we join her in marvelling at the beauty of the garden despite – or perhaps because of – its transitory nature. We leave Ellender hopeful and the garden has helped bulwark that hope.

4/10/2022,"The routine trafficking of political personnel in America to the nation’s television networks hit a road bump last week after staffers at NBC News complained about White House press secretary Jen Psaki’s rumor-as-fact plans to join the liberal news outlet MSNBC when she leaves her West Wing post this summer. The clumsily handled move, previewed in a leak to Axios, triggered anger among journalists who said they feared Psaki’s hiring would “taint” the NBC brand and reinforce the impression, already well-established in opinion polls, that the news business in the US works hand-in-glove with political factions. The Psaki saga is hardly new. If the deal goes through, Psaki will join a long line of White House staff who have moved to media roles. In January, Symone Sanders, a former adviser and senior spokesperson for Kamala Harris, signed a deal with MSNBC to host a show. But the deals are unexceptional to either side of the political divide. Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany joined Fox News last year; Sean Spicer has his own show on Newsmax; and CBS News hired Mick Mulvaney as a paid on-air contributor – also triggering an internal revolt that even prompted late-night host Stephen Colbert to condemn it on his show. The anger is easy to explain. The pipeline between politics and lucrative gigs in the media in America is one that appears to sully the public view of both professions, creating a feeling that both sides are really in it for the money. It also encourages a sense that politics in the US is seen by the media in the same veins as sports – where hiring ex-players as commentators is common – where winning races is everything and actual policy means very little. “The pipeline from the White House to news organizations makes it more difficult for news organizations to have sufficient distance or be perceived to be credibly scrutinizing government,” said Ryan Thomas, an associate professor in the Missouri School of Journalism. “Partisans argue that people won’t care or won’t notice, but it is wrong irrespective of awareness. It’s like they are moving from formal to informal public relations apparatus that is unhealthy in its own terms, irrespective of its potential effects on press accountability.” Psaki’s hire comes at a time of press frustration that Joe Biden has given just eight open-access press conferences during his term, leading to an impression of scripted, artificial performances. Psaki’s tour of duty, transposed to a cable news with a more generous salary, is likely to increase perceptions that political spin and news coverage at cable news networks are so close as to be indistinguishable. The outgoing press secretary has said that she is undergoing “rigorous ethics training” as it relates “to future employment” before her move, adding that she hoped the press corps “would judge me for my record and how I treat you and I try to answer questions from everybody across the board”. Yet the transfer of Psaki to MSNBC seemed so natural that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) went so far as to launch a fundraiser. “She’s fought to restore trust in the free press after the Trump administration’s horrific attacks on the media,” it said in a statement. “And now, she’s planning to join MSNBC’s intrepid team of journalists to hold dangerous, far-right Republicans accountable.” Journalism ethics professors express concern that this type of high-profile hiring to a high-profile cable news network, publicized while Psaki is still in a political role, risks becoming the default image for what the public holds as standard practice for journalism at large. “There’s a trickle-down effect from the irresponsibility of cable news organizations to local news journalists who get tarred with the same brush,” Thomas said. Americans of opposing political parties are sharply divided on how much they trust the news reported by national media organizations, according to new research. A YouGov/Economist poll published last week found that while Americans are more likely to trust than distrust many prominent news sources, there are few organizations that are trusted by more than a small proportion of Americans on both sides of the political aisle. At the top of the list was the Weather Channel at 52%, followed by the BBC (39%), the national public broadcaster PBS (41%), and the Wall Street Journal (37%). At the bottom of the list, in descending order, came CNN, OAN, MSNBC, Fox News and Breitbart. A Gallup poll published last October found that trust in the media to report the news fully, accurately and fairly had edged down to 36%, making last year’s reading the second lowest on record. Only 7% of those polled said they had “a great deal” of trust and confidence in newspapers, television and radio news reporting. Thirty-four per cent said they had “none at all”. The issue of reporting bias, never far from the lips of ideological adversaries, comes as cable news ratings has experienced sharp post-Trump declines that helped expose arrangements that had long been in place but never fully acknowledged. One was the information pipeline between CNN’s Jeff Zucker, his top colleague Allison Gollust, and CNN anchor Chris Cuomo and his brother Andrew. The exposure of Chris Cuomo’s advice to his brother during the sexual harassment scandal that brought the New York governor down eventually helped cost the younger sibling his job, too. But it does not seem like media executives are learning the lessons of fraught ties and allegiances between their top hosts and the political establishment. According to the news outlet Puck, CNN and MSNBC programming executives were in Washington early in the year, courting potential on-air talent to fill holes in primetime slots exposed by the exit of Cuomo and soon-to-exit MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, whose support for Democratic causes is worn openly. One of the potential talents, of course, was Psaki who, Puck opined, had “achieved veritable celebrity status for her daily press briefings”. Wooing Psaki, Thomas said, presents an ethical issue that Psaki was negotiating a new job while determining access to reporters or responding to questions from staff at her future employer. In the longer term, he said, are questions over professional distance between political institutions and news organizations. “These press conferences are a performance of scrutiny rather than actual scrutiny. They become an audition process for a cable news gig,” he said. Not only does the rotation of seats damage the material ability of the press to hold government to account, he adds, but also raises issues of access. “The White House press corps is pretty addicted to access, so they’re easily tamed and shy away from asking tougher questions,” Thomas added.",News/US news,Psaki swaps White House for MSNBC as politics-to-TV pipeline chugs along,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/10/jen-psaki-white-house-tv-msnbc-news-politics
4/10/2022,"Draw 8 November 2020 Premier LeagueManchester City 1-1 Liverpool Kevin De Bruyne’s missed penalty in the 42nd minute, only the second time he had erred from the spot, shaped a lockdown contest Liverpool went at with conviction, as Jürgen Klopp boldly selected Roberto Firmino and Diogo Jota alongside Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané. With such an onus on unfettered attack it was little wonder Kyle Walker soon found himself on the wrong side of Mané and brought down the Liverpool winger for a clear penalty, which Salah smashed into the net. City’s equaliser swiftly followed as a De Bruyne pass found Gabriel Jesus who outfoxed Trent Alexander-Arnold with a deft first touch and spin before prodding past Alisson. But then came De Bruyne’s fluffed spot-kick, awarded on VAR advice after his cross struck Joe Gomez on the arm. Jesus blew a gilt-edged chance on 55 minutes after João Cancelo picked him out, alone to the left of goal, but his header was all wrong. A draw ensured City’s worst start to a league season since 2008 as Liverpool rode their luck for the draw. Defeat 2 July 2020 Premier LeagueManchester City 4-0 Liverpool A guard of honour for Klopp’s newly crowned champions by their predecessors in an empty, echoing Etihad stripped of fans by Covid preceded a withering defeat for Liverpool (who had just thumped Crystal Palace 4-0). Raheem Sterling turned on his old club with furious conviction, grabbing one goal and creating another as City scored three times in 20 first-half minutes. De Bruyne opened the scoring from the penalty spot after Sterling was felled by Gomez. Sterling followed that with a goal from a City counterattack and Phil Foden made it three before half-time after a quick exchange with De Bruyne. Their fourth arrived in the second half when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored an own goal from Sterling’s low drive. Klopp was forced to admit: “Man City are incredible. I saw their season, they didn’t play a bad game.” Defeat 3 January 2019 Premier LeagueManchester City 2-1 Liverpool Klopp was incensed Vincent Kompany was not sent off in the first half for a two-footed lunge on Salah – “I really like Vincent Kompany but how on earth is that not a red card? He is last man and he goes in. If he hits Mo more he is out for the season” – to cap a frustrating defeat for the Premier League pacesetters. With City hard on Liverpool’s heels in the title race, the visitors suffered a setback as the deficit was cut to four points and, but for an astonishing goalline clearance from John Stones, may have emerged with a valued point. Sergio Agüero’s near-post drive put the home side into the lead five minutes before half-time and Liverpool responded via a Firmino stooping header at the midway point of the second half. But 18 minutes from time Leroy Sané unleashed a diagonal shot past Alisson to score via the far post, thus ending Liverpool’s 20-match unbeaten run. Win 10 April 2018 Champions LeagueManchester City 1-2 Liverpool A win for Klopp at the Etihad, but Liverpool were made to battle hard for it and a place in the last four of the Champions League, as well as survive a disallowed goal before half-time. That decision so enraged Guardiola that he was banished to the Colin Bell Stand. City had plenty of work to do to save their Champions League status after their 3-0 defeat in the first leg at Anfield but the tie was beyond them once Salah had clipped in Liverpool’s equaliser in the second half. That said, after Jesus put City up inside two minutes, had Sané’s goal late in the first half not been wrongly ruled offside the outcome may well have been different. The 5-1 aggregate did not reflect City’s thwarted efforts and it was unfortunate for the home side that Firmino’s winner came straight from a misplaced Nicolás Otamendi pass. Of guiding Liverpool to the semi-finals for the first time since 2008, Klopp noted with characteristic understatement: “It’s quite a cool moment.” Draw 19 March 2017 Premier LeagueManchester City 1-1 Liverpool Adam Lallana was left to rue his late miss from six yards out that denied Liverpool all three points in this thrilling draw. The errant England international was not alone in squandering a clear chance as Agüero, the scorer of City’s equaliser, missed another opportunity a few minutes later. Guardiola called the match “one of the most special days of my life” as it came after a woeful Champions League exit against Monaco. Liverpool were fortunate to finish with a full complement of 11 players after the referee missed James Milner’s foul on Sterling denying the City forward a near-certain goal in the first half. Milner’s opener from the penalty spot arrived after Gaël Clichy flattened Firmino. Defeat 9 September 2017 Premier LeagueManchester City 5-0 Liverpool Klopp’s first Etihad meeting with a Guardiola City side set the tone for the misery that would endure. Mané’s flying studs poleaxed Ederson eight minutes before half-time to reduce Liverpool to 10 men and Klopp’s overwhelmed players crumbled in the face of a De Bruyne-inspired City. It was Liverpool’s heaviest defeat in Manchester for 70 years. City were one goal up courtesy of Agüero when Mané received his marching orders and Jesus headed in a second in the time added on at the end of the first half, going on to make the scoreline 3-0 early in the second half. Two more goals arrived from the substitute Sané, capping his pair with a curling shot from 25 yards into the top corner. Win 21 November 2015 Premier LeagueManchester City 1-4 Liverpool Klopp, freshly installed at Liverpool, oversaw the heaviest home defeat City had suffered in 12 years (since a 5-1 thrashing against Arsenal at Maine Road in February 2003). Manuel Pellegrini’s side were three goals down after 33 minutes as City’s tormentor in chief Philippe Coutinho scored one and played a pivotal role in the visitors’ other two. The rout began after eight minutes as Eliaquim Mangala knocked Firmino’s cross into his own goal. Midway through the first half Coutinho met a Firmino cross from the right flank to score from eight yards and a third arrived after Emre Can’s backheel unpicked the City defence, allowing Coutinho to slip a little pass to his right beyond Joe Hart and leave Firmino with an open goal. Agüero briefly offered City a flicker of hope with a goal before half-time but Liverpool turned the screw in the second half and could have bagged more than Martin Skrtel’s 81st-minute shot. For once the City manager revealed his displeasure at his side’s capitulation. “I am more than angry, it is difficult to understand why we played so poorly,” Pellegrini said. Klopp, however, was understandably pleased and was not exaggerating when he said: “We could possibly have won by more than 4-1 but there is no need to be greedy. A result like this should help the boys start to believe in themselves.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp’s Etihad nightmare: one win in six at Guardiola’s fortress,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/10/jurgen-klopp-etihad-nightmare-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-liverpool
4/10/2022,"Charles Leclerc took victory at the Australian Grand Prix for Ferrari with an outstanding drive from pole to take a dominant win over Red Bull’s Sergio Pérez who was second. Defending champion Max Verstappen’s title hopes took a blow as he was forced to retire for the second time in three meetings. Mercedes made the most of his misfortune, George Russell securing third place and Lewis Hamilton in fourth, with their car showing its best race pace thus far this season. McLaren’s Lando Norris was fifth. With the race returning after a two year absence because of the pandemic, Leclerc was in complete control at Albert Park in front of a capacity crowd revelling in the return of racing. Attended by 420,000 people it was the biggest sporting weekend in Australian F1 history, dwarfing even the 356,000 who were at Silverstone last year. The win has extended Leclerc’s lead at the top of the championship after three rounds with a planned 20 still to go. Leclerc now leads with 71 points, Russell moves up to second on 37, with Verstappen on 25 now behind Hamilton who has 28 points. This is Leclerc’s fourth win and his second this season having taken the flag at the first race in Bahrain. Combined with second in Saudi Arabia it is an enormously strong opening for him and his team. Having claimed pole with a mighty lap he went on to prove to have the edge in race pace. This is the start to the season Ferrari can only have dreamed of, being realised with an almost carefree insouciance. The opening for Ferrari with two wins from three races is exactly what the Scuderia required and a statement of intent that cannot be ignored. They are leading the title fight and with a flawless piece of execution in Australia, are clearly going to take some beating. Leclerc was on it from the off. He made a clean start to hold his lead as Hamilton was decisive off the line, passing Norris and then ducking up the inside of Pérez for third through turn one. Racing was swiftly interrupted on lap three however when Carlos Sainz went off, overcooking it into turn nine and prompting the safety car. Leclerc held his place for the restart on lap seven, with Verstappen firmly on his tail but the Ferrari on a heavy fuel load was suffering from heavy porpoising. Pérez in a clearly quicker Red Bull came back at Hamilton, retaking third with ease on the run to turn three on lap 10. As the car settled beneath him Leclerc promptly exploited the pace Ferrari have demonstrated all weekend. He opened a two-second gap to Verstappen, as the Dutchman reported his tyres were graining. By lap 13 he was over five seconds up the road, while Hamilton and Russell were holding station in fourth and fifth in front of the two McLarens, already in a different race, 15 seconds off the lead. They were showing good race pace and better balance than previously across the weekend. The race settled through the opening stages, with Leclerc absolutely in control in the clean air. Red Bull pitted Verstappen for the hard tyre on lap 19, hoping for more competitive pace from the new rubber. While Hamilton had closed on Pérez who was pitted on lap 21, with Mercedes buoyed by the first time this season they have been in a position to challenge a Red Bull on track. Ferrari took their stop for Leclerc on lap 22, Hamilton following him in. His pace had been strong on the final laps before the stops and he emerged in front of Pérez but the Mexican quickly struck to retake the place. Their fight was stymied when the safety car was called on lap 24 after Sebastian Vettel spun and crashed at turn four and Mercedes immediately took advantage, pitting Russell who emerged in third, in front of Hamilton and Pérez. At the restart Leclerc was caught by Verstappen who charged at him but was just held off and he quickly reasserted his dominance. Three seconds clear by lap 32 and setting repeated fastest laps Leclerc remained ultimately untroubled. Russell had stoutly held off Pérez for third, again reason for optimism at Mercedes until the Mexican finally swept past on lap 36, with Russell conscious of using his tyres up driving defensively. The drama was in Leclerc’s wake however. Verstappen had looked solid for at least second only to pull over as his car gave up the ghost on lap 39, with a potential hydraulic problem. Red Bull have a quick car without doubt but a disappointed Verstappen knows they cannot afford to drop points with reliability problems. The midfield had been closely matched though the race, if somewhat processional but Leclerc remained in a class of his own, 20 seconds clear at the flag. He was flawless over the final third and took fastest lap to seal his position as the clear championship front-runner. Daniel Ricciardo was in sixth for McLaren, Esteban Ocon was seventh for Alpine, Valtteri Bottas in eighth for Alfa Romeo, Pierre Gasly ninth for AlphaTauri and Alex Albon an impressive tenth for Williams.",Sport/Sport,Charles Leclerc wins F1 Australian GP after Max Verstappen is forced to retire,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/charles-leclerc-wins-f1-australian-gp-after-max-verstappen-is-forced-to-retire
4/10/2022,"Lockdown stimulated all kinds of unexpected creative urges. For Neil Tennant, of synthpop masterminds Pet Shop Boys, the outcome was a collection of folk songs. “During lockdown I started recording songs I’d written in the 70s,” he said, in an interview for BBC Radio 4’s This Cultural Life. “And they were on the guitar.” Tennant’s first musical forays came in his teenage years in Newcastle with a folk band called Dust, inspired by the Incredible String Band. His early songs, Tennant told interviewer John Wilson, were composed on guitar and inspired by whichever chord he had learned that day. “The first song I wrote that I thought was a good song, which I’m not embarrassed by even now, was called Can You Hear the Dawn Break?” he said. “And it was very folky. We actually got a session on BBC Radio Newcastle. We did four or five songs that were broadcast at breakfast in the morning.” Listeners to the show will hear a clip from the song, featuring a young woman singing over a guitar and what sounds like a mandolin. “It’s more folky than I became,” Tennant admitted, but he said he had continued to write songs on guitar as well as keyboard for Pet Shop Boys. His musical partner, Chris Lowe, was less taken by this new acoustic endeavour. “Chris said to me, you know, these aren’t … This isn’t … I don’t even know if you want to do anything with these. But this isn’t the Pet Shop Boys.” A Neil Tennant solo folk album is not slated for release, yet. “It’s not really an album,” Tennant said. “It’s about five songs at the moment. … I don’t know. Maybe. I’ve got no plans for it, though.” The interview runs through Tennant’s 50-year career, from his time in publishing, editing the Mary Berry ITV cookbook in 1981 – “I used to think ‘whatever happened to Mary Berry’” – and his collaboration with David Bowie on Hallo Spaceboy. Tennant and Lowe cut up lyrics from Space Oddity to add a new verse, and told Bowie in a phone call. “He didn’t sound very happy – ‘sounds like you’d better come in’,” Tennant said. He played Bowie a demo, singing the verse. “And he loved it. He said, ‘Yeah, but you will have to keep singing it’.” The muses for one of Pet Shop Boys’ biggest hits, West End Girls, were Grandmaster Flash and TS Eliot, Tennant said. “I always loved the poem, The Waste Land by TS Eliot, even though I don’t really understand it, to this day, but I love all the different voices. So in writing West End Girls, I was also thinking of writing a collage of different voices. So it’s not just one voice all the way through. It’s dialogue. It’s like found dialogue.” He still gets pleasure creating, and said he would probably make records even if they weren’t being released. But Tennant’s observational lyrics and Pet Shop Boys’ complex melody lines make him wonder if they have become “old-fashioned”. Tennant, who is 67 and a former Smash Hits writer, added that he was not that interested in contemporary pop music. “And maybe that’s because of my age, which would be a totally reasonable thing,” he said. “To me pop music nowadays is very narcissistic. I find that a bit tedious. “Sometimes I wish it had more art in it, rather than, you know, dissing your boyfriend or something. You know, David Bowie wasn’t really Ziggy Stardust.” This Cultural Life, with Neil Tennant, is on Radio 4 on Saturday 16 April at 7.15pm",Arts/Music,From Pet Shop Boy to nostalgic folkie: Neil Tennant plays guitar,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/10/neil-tennant-plays-guitar-from-pet-shop-boy-to-nostalgic-folkie
4/10/2022,"It feels strange now to recall that two years ago we had just entered a three-month stretch of government-enforced hermithood as the battle with Covid was joined. I lived alone, forbidden from spending time with anyone else, so my social life consisted of Saturday nights in front of my laptop doing a virtual pub quiz. It quickly became the new normal, but now I wonder how I ever adjusted. One of the aspects of lockdown living I would like to reintroduce, though, is cutting my working week. As a freelance, for a while there was just less work available. And so, having written about the theory of the four-day week, I found myself living it in practice. Lucky enough to afford to take the hit, I discovered I loved having more time to myself – even though there wasn’t actually that much to do. It has made me a more enthusiastic proponent of shorter working hours. So I will watch with interest the results of the world’s largest four-day week pilot launched last week. The trial will involve 3,000 workers across 60 British companies, who will be paid the same salary for a shorter working week. The case for a four-day week starts with the insight that human progress should not just be measured by the accumulation of “stuff”, but rather of time. One hundred and fifty years ago, Britons worked on average a 62-hour week, an appalling thought. Who’s to say our current conception of full-time work, the five-day week, is right? As technology from the wheel to the widget means societies can produce more and more with the same human input, it seems a no-brainer to think that we should bank some of the gains by enriching our lives with more time spent with people we love on the things we enjoy, rather than more consumer goods. There are other benefits. Substituting more time over increases in collective wealth will also be better for the environment. And by embedding a more flexible working culture for both men and women, a shorter work week would help reduce the gender-based pay gap (much of which is accounted for by part-time work holding mothers back from progressing in workplaces where working full time is the norm). The concern, however, is that only some will get to benefit from these changes. Our labour market is riven not just by inequalities of pay but in working conditions, such as the amount of flexibility and autonomy employees are permitted. This was notable during the pandemic. While some of us got to work more flexibly from home, sometimes, admittedly, in less-than-ideal conditions, many others, especially those in lower-paid work, experienced little change in how they worked, having to put their health at risk to continue the daily grind. And now, as many white-collar companies embrace hybrid working, allowing their workers to cut down on commuting, others are stuck paying more for less frequent public transport or having to contend with the rising cost of petrol to get to and from work. The experience of technology has been different, too. Zoom may not be quite the same as sitting in a room with colleagues, but for me it has reduced time spent in unnecessary meetings. In contrast, some workers report they have experienced greater use of surveillance technology since the pandemic, which was already being deployed by companies such as Amazon, which uses it to track worker movements around the warehouse. Tools such as keystroke and phone call monitoring erode autonomy, privacy and trust between employer and employee. While 80% of us say we would like to reduce our working week, few are actually in a position to negotiate this with their employers without losing pay. Mass historical reductions in working time have been achieved as a result of collective union bargaining. But today, a fraction of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and the typical union member is a middle-income, professional public sector employee, with low-paid private sector workers out in the cold. It is also easy to see how the productivity argument, the idea that people working shorter weeks are more efficient and so can get almost as much done in less time, appeals more to white-collar employers than those in service sectors that depend on intensive human interaction, such as childcare and social care. So the danger is that better-off workers in a position to demand more from their employees will benefit from innovations in working time, while less affluent workers feel little benefit. That has happened in France, where, despite higher levels of unionisation, managers have disproportionately benefited from measures to reduce working time. The government, too, seems to be retreating from its manifesto commitment to make flexible working the default. It has picked cheap fights on flexible working as tabloid fodder, with ministers accusing civil servants working from home of laziness and seeming to back an it’s-not-work-if-you’re-not-at-your-desk culture. The difficulty is that working time improvements are no different to those in pay. They cost employers money and involve a redistribution of profits from owners to workers. The share of GDP that goes to workers in the form of wages is lower than it was at its peak in the 1970s and average working time hasn’t changed much since either. So the risk of this new trial is that it demonstrates that a move to a shorter working week isn’t cost-free and consequently gets ignored by most employers, save those who see this as a way of making themselves more competitive when it comes to recruitment and retention. The economic reality is that a shorter working week will never be delivered through the goodwill of employers. Just as it took the union movement to negotiate the significant reductions in working time that meant people were no longer expected to work on Saturdays, it will only happen in an economy where workers have more power to negotiate what’s good for them.

4/10/2022,"Not long ago, Brexit Britain was the bad boy of Europe. Then it was Poland’s turn, its rightwing leadership likewise excoriated for defying the Brussels establishment. Now, after the invasion of Ukraine, it’s Germany that’s getting all the stick. Some of this criticism is deserved. Some of it resurrects ugly stereotypes and old prejudices harking back to the Nazi era. Olaf Scholz’s government is under increasingly fierce pressure to halt gas and oil imports that help fuel Vladimir Putin’s war machine – and stop blocking tougher EU sanctions on Moscow’s fossil fuels. When Germany’s chancellor visited Downing Street on Friday, Boris Johnson urged him to break Berlin’s and Europe’s “embarrassing” €1bn-a-day Russian energy habit. Brexit’s chief clown and Brussels-baiter has not been forgiven by the EU, and probably never will be, but Scholz’s visit showed how Ukraine has radically altered perspectives. The crisis has reminded even jingoistic Brexiters that core UK interests are inseparable from Europe’s. And Germany, despite everything, still values the British alliance. So Johnson minded his p’s and q’s. Not so Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, who accuses Scholz of placing German self-interest above Ukraine’s suffering. “It is not the voice of German businessmen or of German billionaires which should be heard in Berlin today. It is the voice of all the innocent women and children, the voice of the murdered people who should be heard,” Morawiecki said last week. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, frequently draws parallels with the second world war. Addressing the Bundestag last month, he accused Germany of failing to fulfil its post-Holocaust responsibility to ensure such horrors did not reoccur – and of past appeasement of Russia through economic engagement at the expense of democratic rights. “Every year, politicians repeat the words ‘never again’ and now we see that these words are simply worth nothing. In Europe, a people is being destroyed,” Zelenskiy said. In further remarks after Russian atrocities in the town of Bucha were uncovered, he took aim at Angela Merkel, Scholz’s predecessor, and France’s former president, Nicolas Sarkozy: “I invite Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to visit Bucha to see what the policy of 14 years of concessions to Russia has led to.” Incoming flak is not confined to the eastern flank. “We cannot continue financing the Putin system that is waging this horrible war,” Manfred Weber, head of the European People’s party in the European parliament, told Politico. In a symbolic vote reflecting fury at Moscow, the parliament voted on Thursday for a “total and immediate” embargo on Russian energy imports. Studies suggest Germany could more easily manage without Russian oil and gas than Scholz seems to think, and opinion polls show growing domestic support for tougher measures, despite the pain they would cause. Scholz’s stance is also coming under friendly fire. Having previously followed Berlin’s line, Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, who is fighting for his political life in Sunday elections, now backs an embargo. “What just happened in Bucha requires a new set of sanctions,” Macron said. “I want us to be able to act.” France, he added, would “coordinate with our European partners, especially Germany”. In the event, Germany, backed by Hungary and Austria, again blocked expedited EU oil (and gas) sanctions. Maybe Macron, with an eye on voters, expected this – and was content for Germany to be cast as the villain. It’s true that Scholz was slow to appreciate the risk posed by Putin’s pre-war build-up. He refused, in line with past policy, now reversed, to supply weapons to Kyiv. It’s true, too, that after the invasion began, he moved swiftly to suspend the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, announced an unprecedented increase in defence spending, and backed initial EU and US sanctions. Yet in recent weeks, it’s also plain that Germany, which depends on Russia for 55% of its gas and 34% of it oil, has been dragging its feet. A report in Die Welt meanwhile suggested that even previously agreed sanctions were not being effectively implemented by Berlin. Claims by those who nurture old enmities and present grudges that Germany cares more about money than mass murder are deeply unfair. But Ukraine has delivered a shocking blow to the system, giving Germans a sense, perhaps, of how Greeks felt following the 2009 debt crisis. First, a successful industrial policy based on cheap energy has gone up in smoke almost overnight. Second, a foreign policy predicated on a belief that peaceful relations can be secured through mutually beneficial commerce now lies in ruins, along with the reputation of its chief advocate, Angela Merkel. Putin’s actions are not based on rational assessments of Russia’s best interests. Rather, they are essentially delusional, ideological and nationalistic. Germany’s post-Ukraine relationship with China, another aggressive, ideologically driven authoritarian regime and major trading partner, is now subject to similar revision. Third, its response to Ukraine has raised a big question mark over German leadership in Europe. The EU is clearly split along east-west lines, with Poland, the Baltic republics and normally quiescent people such as the Czechs demanding a much tougher response to Russia. This rift could become permanent. At this dangerous juncture, western and northern EU states that traditionally look to Berlin for a lead look in vain. Yet Europe, from long experience, knows it cannot wholly rely on the French. Italy, Spain and the rest are largely bystanders. And Johnson’s Britain is trapped in a foolish fantasy of singular self-importance. If Scholz made a stand on energy, most would follow. This is a moment requiring bold, sensible leadership. Scholz is eminently sensible. Now he must be bolder. For Ukraine’s and Europe’s sake, Germany must play the good guy at last and pull the plug on Russia.",Opinion/Opinion,Germany must shake off its torpor and play its full role against Putin | Simon Tisdall,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/10/germany-role-against-delusional-putin
4/10/2022,"Earendel – “morning star” in Old English – is among the first stars to exist in our universe, born less than one billion years after the Big Bang. And the Hubble space telescope has just performed the remarkable feat of detecting light from it. Mostly, the telescope gives us images of nearby galaxies in intricate detail, but those of distant galaxies are very murky indeed. Astronomer Brian Welch and his team, from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, discovered the star while hunting for hints of the earliest galaxies. These galaxies are very hard to see, and the team chose to examine a selection of images from the Hubble looking for clues. Astronomers aren’t newcomers when it comes to observing ancient light. Just this week it revealed incredible pictures of a galaxy as it was, half a billion years before Earendel. Although this surpasses what we expected Hubble could do, it isn’t as remarkable a feat as resolving a single star, and when you see the shapeless smudge of that early galaxy, it brings it home how special Earendel is. In detective fiction, the sleuth uses a magnifying glass to study evidence left at the crime scene, moving the lens to magnify the clue. We can’t launch ever more gigantic glass lenses into space but, luckily, nature provides us with an alternative, much more powerful method. Massive clusters of galaxies provide such a gravitational pull that the light from background stars is bent around the cluster, just like light bends in a magnifying glass. This effect – “gravitational lensing” – is used in astronomy to see objects too faint or too far away to see otherwise. We cannot just go about moving galaxies to magnify where we like, though; we must follow where the universe leads us. In one snapshot, Welch and his team saw a faraway galaxy that had been magnified and distorted. Nothing new there. But within that distorted galaxy, there was an unexpected bright smudge. One star in the galaxy aligned with the lens so precisely that its image has been enhanced a thousand times over, making it seem big and bright. And the colour of the light from Earendel indicates we are seeing ancient light. Light has different properties depending on its energy: the electromagnetic spectrum stretches from low energy, long wavelength radio waves, through the infra-red, a rainbow of optical light, and up to the high energy, short wavelength X-rays. Starlight loses energy on its journey towards us, sliding down the spectrum, getting redder as it goes. Earendel’s light is very red indeed, suggesting that the light has travelled huge distances over the better part of 13 billion years, placing it in the era of the first stars. Observations of early galaxies are rare, and visuals of individual stars within this era have been nonexistent until now. Earendel is not of the oldest generation of stars, but it’s tantalisingly close. Studying this era is like uncovering the early evolution of humankind, but on a galactic scale. Our ancestors are like us, but there are important differences to explore. So it is with the universe now, compared to the universe then. We need to go as far back to the Big Bang as we can to fill in the gaps. The observation of Earendel is record-breaking. It did not just improve upon the previous record, it smashed it to smithereens, and it might be a record that is here to stay. The light from Earendel is so faint that, had it not been so perfectly aligned with the cosmic lens, we wouldn’t have seen it at all. There is no guarantee that we will chance upon another cluster with a similarly serendipitous alignment and stars any further away might be too faint to see. In common with other major scientific advances, years of hard work, expertise and speculation have been helped over the finish line by a generous helping of good luck. As with all evidence testing our powers of observation, there is a possibility of mistaken identity. While light from a distant, blue star will have lost energy so it appears redder, we could just be looking at something much closer that is red to begin with. The chances of a random, reddish star lining up with that old, distorted galaxy is small, but not impossible, so the team will use infrared data from the brand-new James Webb space telescope to rule out the suspect. Next in the line-up is a black hole, which can look like a star if the surrounding matter spiralling inwards is magnified in a certain way. This time it is X-ray observations that will help us decide for sure. Combining different wavelengths of light is not new to astronomy; it is not new to everyday life either. Imagine a doctor diagnosing a broken arm in person. They’ll examine your arm in a well-lit room, but how do they know for sure it’s broken? How bad a break is it? Will you ever play tennis again? You’d hope they would at least send you for an X-ray. To distinguish what we are seeing in space, we need to use different light wavelengths in a similarly exhaustive way and interpret our observations as expertly as a doctor does. Earendel looks to be the farthest star we have ever detected, and possibly will ever detect. A chance alignment of celestial objects, seen from an incomprehensibly vast distance, has provided exciting evidence of the universe in its infancy. We might be firmly on the trail of the faintest stars in the universe, but we’re going to need more than a magnifying glass to be sure. We’re going to have to think on an entirely different wavelength.

4/10/2022,"Watching Robert Altman’s The Player nearly 30 years after its release is like buying a ticket for a time-traveling Hollywood tour bus. There’s Jack Lemmon playing piano at a party and Martin Mull eating lunch on an outdoor patio. Look, John Cusack and Anjelica Huston are sitting together at that restaurant, and isn’t that Cher entering a charity event in a stunning red dress? These actors, and many more, play themselves in The Player, and most have just one line of dialogue. Some have none. Brief as their appearances may be, they play a vital role, situating the incisive and absurdist showbiz story in the real world. Or at least in the real Hollywood. How did Altman get them to work for nothing in such minuscule roles? He only told them, “I’m making a film about a studio executive who murders a screenwriter and gets away with it.” According to Altman, each response was identical. They laughed and asked when they should show up. Much like Sunset Boulevard, the best film ever made about Hollywood, The Player initially presents itself as film noir. Its protagonist, Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins), is a classic antihero, a studio executive who kills a man he believes has been sending him death threats, only to discover it was the wrong guy, and his harasser is still out there. The police are closing in on him, but just when you have a handle on the film’s tone, Altman swerves. Next, it’s an insider’s look at office politics in Hollywood, then an absurdist comedy, a sleek thriller and eventually a postmodern fairytale with the most twisted happy ending you’re ever likely to see. One of the great achievements of The Player is how steady it stays on its feet as it navigates these tonal twists and turns. Ultimately, The Player is remembered as Hollywood satire, a film about film-making, and its meaning is relayed through its form as much as its content. Altman constantly reminds us that we’re watching a movie, and that The Player is a deeply Hollywoodified version of the events it depicts. The eight-minute tracking shot through a studio backlot that opens the film features characters musing about cinema’s all-time great tracking shots (including Touch of Evil, Rope and The Sheltering Sky), while posters of obscure film noirs and B-movies paper the walls of every room. A key scene is set at a screening of Vittorio De Sica’s neorealist masterpiece Bicycle Thieves, the kind of bleak, artful film the characters in The Player claim to love but would never make. It’s a neat trick that eradicates any sentimentality – a must for satire – and allows viewers to both indulge in the film’s conventionality, like the happy ending for its main character, while also feeling superior to it. No wonder it was such a hit within the industry. The Player was considered a triumphant return for Altman, a seminal figure of New Hollywood who, like most of his compadres, got a bit lost in the 80s. Before that, he built his career by poking holes in the most self-important American myths, the war movie (M*A*S*H) and the western (McCabe and Mrs Miller). The Player is closer in feel to Nashville, his 1975 film set in the country music world that cuts between biting irony and earnest scenes of loneliness and human connection. It was also his return to the Oscar race, as The Player earned nominations for best director, best adapted screenplay and best editing. That’s no surprise. Hollywood is always game for a good-natured ribbing because it reinforces the industry’s place atop the culture. Only the most powerful institutions are worth satirizing. For Altman, however, The Player was barely about the movie industry at all. It was about the corporatization of Hollywood, with the director using his chosen industry as a metaphor for, as he put it in an interview, “the cultural problems with western civilization”. Altman saw in Hollywood dealings a reflection of merciless boardroom culture that invaded the American economy in the 1980s, when a little harmless greed curdled into sociopathy. For most of the film, Griffin Mill is on the verge of being arrested for murder, but he is equally concerned with the new hire at work, an up-and-comer named Larry Levy (played with effortless smarm by Peter Gallagher) who never makes an overt move for Griffin’s job but nonetheless creates a maddening distraction. To Griffin, a murder rap is as threatening as a demotion, and he’ll stop at nothing to beat them both. Griffin is an empty suit, a violent criminal and possibly a lunatic – his interactions with his girlfriend (Cynthia Stevenson) are chillingly dispassionate – but he passes for a sympathetic figure in The Player because he at least pretends to care about film. He is even known around town as a “writer’s exec”, a moniker that over the course of the movie starts to feel like an epitaph. Levy, on the other hand, is all business, no show. He believes writers are overrated and overpaid, and that studio execs could easily do the creative work themselves. He routinely attends AA meetings, even though he’s not an alcoholic, because “that’s where the deals are made these days”. He represents the new evil, and Griffin is the old. As played by Tim Robbins, a master at manipulating his innate earnestness, it’s impossible to tell if he’s a sociopath pretending to be human or vice versa, but as the fear pools behind his glacier-blue eyes, we can convince ourselves he is just another everyman who has fallen out of step with the world. We can’t help but root for him to win. In The Player, he does. In the real world, not so much. Looking at the state of the movie business today, it’s hard not to feel that the Larry Levys of the world are now in charge. Franchise film-making, the dominant movie trend of our time, inherently devalues the writers and empowers the producers. You probably can’t tell me who wrote the last Spider-Man movie, but I bet you know the name of Kevin Feige, the producer and architect of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Nowadays, the struggle between commerce and art isn’t decided by office politics and individual greed. It’s the cold, hard macroeconomics of the global marketplace and corporate synergy. That’s the part that The Player didn’t foresee. What does play well today is Altman’s outright refusal to blame it all on the suits. The Player wraps up with a contrived happy ending its characters don’t deserve, but Altman draws attention to the artifice, reminding us once again of its phoniness and implicitly pointing his criticisms back at the viewer. “The enemy in a film like this is the audience,” Altman said in an interview. “If people don’t go see these manufactured films, they’re not going to get made.” It’s a bit like a bully hitting you with your own fist, asking you all the time why you’re punching yourself, but he’s not wrong. His equal-opportunity approach to the satire – Altman even admitted that he sees much of himself in Griffin – is what makes The Player so endearing. It pinpoints the beaten, bloodied state of American decency at the end of the 20th century and blames us all for the carnage.",Arts/Film,‘The enemy is the audience’: Robert Altman’s The Player at 30,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/10/robert-altman-the-player-at-30
