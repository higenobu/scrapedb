2/26/2022,"Whistleblowers Gretchen Carlson and Zelda Perkins are among dozens of high-profile women calling on Channel 4 News to free all former staff from “gagging orders” amid mounting concern over the programme’s alleged use of confidentiality agreements to silence staff in equal pay, discrimination, harassment and victimisation cases. MPs say they have seen at least seven gagging orders relating to women working in the Channel 4 newsroom, with at least two appearing to have been issued late last year. Carlson, the former Fox News anchor who successfully sued her ex-boss, Roger Ailes, for sexual harassment and Perkins, who broke her non-disclosure agreement relating to Harvey Weinstein, are among those demanding Channel 4 News rescinds confidentiality agreements that they claim have been used to silence women. They want the public service broadcaster to “earn its reputation as an inclusive and progressive workplace” and follow the example of NBC News in the US, which has released all former employees who signed nondisclosure agreements over sexual harassment claims. “We think the same needs to happen in Britain, too. Gagging orders are the opposite of journalism. Journalism uncovers the truth, gagging orders hide it,” said an open letter backed by 30 prominent campaigners and which includes cross-party MP support. Among the signatories are Carrie Gracie, who became a figurehead for BBC women when she resigned as China editor in 2018 over pay inequalities and prominent BBC journalist Samira Ahmed. Perkins’s decision to break the NDAs that the now convicted rapist Weinstein forced her to sign prompted wide debate over the misuse of gagging orders. She said this weekend: “Their use has to stop.” She added: “When used wrongly, they become secret settlement contracts used to hide wrongdoing.” Labour MP Jess Phillips, who campaigns for women’s rights, said: “People who feel they have been silenced in cases of maternity discrimination, bullying or harassment should be free to talk. “In my experience, the silencing of women furthers the abuse, it’s part of the pattern of abuse. People don’t sign these things in a completely free-choice environment; where there is a power imbalance, you cannot say that.” Other MPs to back the letter include Labour’s Stella Creasy, the SNP’s Alison Thewliss and former Home Office minister Caroline Nokes, who chairs the women and equalities committee. Recently, the Tory MP and former culture secretary Maria Miller wrote to Deborah Turness, chief executive of ITN, which makes Channel 4 News, after being “approached by a number of whistleblowers” to raise her concerns. The letter, also signed by Patsy Stevenson, whose photograph went viral after her arrest at a vigil following the murder of Sarah Everard, adds: “Channel 4 News women deserve the dignity of telling their stories. We believe all former ITN staff deserve the dignity of being heard.” Employers often use NDAs and confidentiality clauses in the settlement of employment cases, but campaigners argue they can be misused to bury cases of sexual harassment, discrimination and racism. Channel 4 News journalists have covered the misuse of NDAs in the past, even making a powerful documentary about women required to sign NDAs after working with Weinstein. One former employee recently told the Guardian she was left ​​feeling “traumatised” and “gagged” after signing a settlement agreement containing a confidentiality clause with the company. A statement from ITN said: “The settlement agreements used by ITN for employment matters are standard across many industries and include a whistleblowing clause enabling any individual to speak out about wrongdoing where it is a matter of public interest. The inclusion of confidentiality provisions is agreed by mutual consent, often at the request of the individual and their lawyer. “We maintain a zero-tolerance approach to any form of bullying, harassment or discrimination, and investigate any alleged incidents fully before taking appropriate action where necessary.” ",News/Media,Whistleblowers call out Channel 4 News over ‘gagging orders’,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/26/whistleblowers-call-out-channel-4-news-over-gagging-orders
2/26/2022,"On stage in a hotel ballroom glowing red, white and blue, Ron DeSantis was recalling his days in Congress and a book he wrote about America’s troubles. It was “read by about a dozen people,” the Florida governor said with rare self-deprecation. DeSantis then told a gathering of grassroots conservatives on Thursday: “I look back at that time, it almost seems a little quaint to me because the threats we face to freedom, the threats we face to a just society, are much more pervasive than they were just 10 years ago.” Many Americans across the political spectrum would agree that something has gone terribly wrong over the past decade. Liberals might point to deepening inequality, a rise of white nationalism and an existential threat to democracy from the authoritarian right. But DeSantis and fellow travellers at this week’s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, see themselves not as dismantlers of democracy but its saviours. In their worldview, the true danger comes not from former president Donald Trump’s “big lie” of a stolen election but a radical left minority imposing socialism, cancel culture and “woke” ideology on the majority. Welcome to a parallel universe where it is common cause that Trump was spied on by rival Hillary Clinton, the January 6 insurrection was a heroic stand by patriots, and names such as Anthony Fauci, Justin Trudeau and Black Lives Matter are guaranteed to elicit loud boos. It is a universe where Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association, an organisation accused of illegally diverting tens of millions of dollars for lavish personal trips, and which tried and failed to file for bankruptcy, can still be feted when he boasts of a record 5.4 million first-time gun buyers last year. And it is universe where Trump still reigns supreme, his face emblazoned on toy money and Superman images, his name stitched into souvenir badges, hats, hammocks and T-shirts that proclaim “Trump 2024”. Bids for a 5x5in painting by Michael Shellis depicting the former president kissing the Stars and Stripes opened at $3,000. Trump is due to be the headline speaker at CPAC on Saturday night. A familiar line at his recent campaign rallies has been, “I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy. I’m the one who is trying to save it.” It is an argument that many at CPAC seem to sincerely believe, based on three justifications. First, they amplify Trump’s baseless claim of widespread election rigging. Interviews with CPAC attendees found it is taken as gospel. For example, Tom Freeman, 66, a retailer from Jupiter, Florida, insisted: “The fraud in 2020 is real, it’s huge, it’s millions of fraudulent votes. Democracy in the United States is under assault due to illegal immigration and voter fraud and manipulation that’s done on a systemic level.” The assertion, rejected by election officials and courts, is used to justify sweeping voter suppression laws in Republican-led states. Josh Mandel, an aggressively pro-Trump candidate for the US Senate in Ohio, won cheers when he told the CPAC audience: “We have Democrats who think it’s OK to cheat in elections, and I would submit to you that one of the most important fights of our day is to stop the cheating from the left... I want to say it very clearly and very directly. I believe this election was stolen from Donald J Trump.” Mandel described Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, Republican members of a House of Representative select committee investigating the January 6 riot, as “traitors”, adding: “We should abolish the January commission and replace it with a November 3 commission” – a reference to the date of the 2020 election. Rewriting the history of the insurrection is the second component of this inverted universe. At a CPAC session on Friday entitled, “The Truth about January 6th”, Julie Kelly, author of a book on the subject, accused the government of persecuting innocent demonstrators and hiding 14,000 hours of surveillance video. “We deserve to know how many FBI undercover agents and informants were involved,” she said, airing another bogus conspiracy theory. Kelly added that if Republicans gain control of the House, they should “turn the January 6 committee 180 degrees” to investigate how Democrats and the justice department “have abused their power to punish Trump supporters to criminalise political dissent because that’s not what this country is about”. The comments earned enthusiastic applause at CPAC, where few attendees share the conventional view of January 6 as a seditious assault on democracy. They are more likely to say it was morally justified, or that a few protesters went too far, or that it was a false flag operation by the FBI intended to discredit Trump supporters. Lisa Forsyth, 54, from Tampa, Florida, said she was in Washington that day but did not go inside the Capitol building. “To see the amount of bad press for just being there is out of line. Some of us didn’t do anything wrong but we’re lumped in with the infiltrators. There’s video footage of these people changing into Trump gear from their black stuff. There’s video footage out there but it’s a total denial.” Asked if she feels democracy is under threat, Forsyth, who is retired from a family pharmaceutical company, replied: “No, I wouldn’t use that phrase, I’m sorry, but that’s a line that I hear the liberals use all the time and I’m obviously not one of them. Our freedom is definitely under threat.” But standing nearby, Rachel Sheley, a chief information security officer from northern Kentucky, disagreed. “Democracy is under threat because they’re trying to infiltrate us with communism,” the 53-year-old said. “First amendment, second amendment – they want to strip them all away. If they are successful in doing so one at time all undercover, they’re stealing away the rights of our democracy.” Third, the movement goes on the offensive by accusing Democrats of being the true anti-democratic party. This narrative holds that an unelected, leftist minority controls schools and universities, the mainstream media and the big tech giants of Silicon Valley, pushing politically correct “wokeness” on transgender, race and other cultural issues. It therefore follows that the conservative rank and file is fighting a righteous cause in defence of the “real America”. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas told CPAC: “We are taking this country back from the lunatic socialist left that is trying to destroy our freedom.” Warning that major institutions have become infected with the “woke virus”, DeSantis urged courage. “We have an opportunity to make 2020 to the year that America fought back. We’re going to lead the charge here in Florida but we need people all over the country to be willing to put on that full armour of God, to stand firm against the left’s schemes.” Mike Pompeo, the former secretary of state, added: “There is no threat greater to the United States than that which emanates inside our republic, emanates inside our school system. If we do not teach our children, the next generation, that we are not a racist nation, then surely the bad guys will come to be right about an America in decline.” Such speeches cast the struggle in heroic terms so that criticism is only likely to harden the siege mentality and resolve of the foot soldiers. Those wandering the corridors of CPAC seemed to share Joe Biden’s view that a struggle for the soul of America is under way – but were convinced that the president is on the wrong side. Lauren Lamp, 22, who works in corporate bankruptcy in New York, said: “Clearly, we can see from the past year Biden is a larger threat than Trump ever was. Trump was trying to restore the American dream. Biden: nobody knows what he’s doing because he does not address the American people. We don’t even know if it’s him working behind the scenes.” Sam Leiter, 56, insisted that democracy is under threat from cancel culture. “You can’t say what you want. There’s no free speech. If you don’t agree with the radical left you lose your job, you can get tarred and feathered, smeared. They’ll go after you and destroy you.” But what does Leiter make of the argument that Trump’s increasingly authoritarian Republican party is the threat to democracy? “It’s a classic case in psychology of projection,” said the speech therapist from Baltimore, Maryland. “Project on your spouse or some other person or people what you’re doing yourself. “It’s always been around in human relationships but in American political circles Bill Clinton was a master at that and it’s gotten worse, It’s now been proven that it was a complete hoax and yet for years they were accusing Trump of Russia collusion. And it was it was Hillary that was colluding with the Russians. She literally was.” Trump’s 2016 election campaign had dozens of contacts with Russia. There is no evidence that Hillary Clinton colluded with Russia – literally or otherwise.",News/US news,The strange Republican world where the big lie lives on and Trump is fighting to save democracy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/26/cpac-republicans-democrats-america-trump-biden
2/26/2022,"A group of artists are pulling their work from the Manchester leg of a prestigious touring art exhibition after the director of the Whitworth art gallery was asked to leave his post following a row over the removal of a statement of solidarity with Palestine’s “liberation struggle”. The 23 artists – including the Turner prize winners Helen Cammock, Tai Shani and Oscar Murillo – were among 48 due to feature in the British Art Show 9 when it arrives in venues across Manchester, including the Whitworth, in May. But on Saturday they said they were “outraged and appalled” by the university’s attempt to force Alistair Hudson to resign and would not be participating in the Manchester segment of the exhibition – organised every five years by London’s Hayward Gallery – in support of Hudson, Palestinians and political freedom and artistic expression. The Guardian reported on Tuesday that Hudson had been asked to leave his post by the university after a series of complaints by UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI). Sources said the university explicitly cited his response to the fallout from an exhibition that denounced Israel’s military operations in Gaza and its “ethnic cleansing” of Palestinians. UKLFI told the Guardian it had “suggested that the university should take appropriate disciplinary action” against Hudson. The critical statement, which was removed in August, was part of an exhibition, Cloud Studies, by Forensic Architecture, a Turner prize-nominated investigative agency, that explored how pollution, chemical attacks and the aftermath of explosions affect marginalised people in places around the world, including Palestine. In a letter to Nancy Rothwell, the president and vice-chancellor of the University of Manchester, the 23 artists condemned the university’s response, saying it was a “direct attack on political freedom and artistic expression”. Citing the university’s “capitulation to continued UKLFI pressure and demands”, they said its actions set a “very dangerous precedent” for cultural institutions, galleries and higher education. “Truth needs to be made public, and cultural spaces have to remain open for difficult discussions,” they wrote. The letter added: “BAS 9 exhibition is structured around the curatorial framework of healing, care and reparative history; tactics of togetherness and imagining new futures, which is at odds with recent events. “Our deep commitment to these themes under fear of censorship makes it impossible to continue our engagement with the University of Manchester given the current position of the institution.” They said they would pull their work from the Manchester exhibition “unless meaningful reparative measures are taken”. A spokesperson for Hayward Gallery Touring said they were in “open discussion” with the show’s artists and its curators, Irene Aristizábel and Hammad Nasar, “to decide next steps for Manchester”. The University of Manchester said staffing matters “remain strictly internal to the university” and it would not comment on Hudson, whom it described as “our current Whitworth director”. A spokesperson added: “We would, however, like to address the explicit criticism in the coverage that the university has in some way suppressed academic and artistic freedoms, or bowed to external pressures. We refute such claims entirely. Museums and galleries have traditionally been a space of experimentation and challenge and we hope that the Whitworth is a place where we can debate, discuss and disagree well. “As a university and gallery, there are various rights and duties which apply across our work, including the protection of academic freedom, freedom of speech and expression and duties under equality laws (including the public sector equality duty). We work tirelessly to ensure that these rights, and our duties (including our public sector duties), are considered fully and carefully.”",Arts/Art and design,Artists shun exhibition amid Whitworth row over Palestine statement,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/26/artists-shun-exhibition-amid-whitworth-row-over-palestine-statement
2/26/2022,"A record number of more than 400 workers in England have left the NHS every week to restore their work-life balance over the last year, according to a new analysis of the workforce crisis hitting the health service. The flood of departures comes with staff complaining of burnout and cases of post-traumatic stress disorder following two years of battling the Covid pandemic. There are now concerns that the exodus is impacting the quality of care, with more than a quarter of adults saying they or an immediate family member had received poor care as a result of the workforce problems. The findings emerged in an assessment of the health service compiled by John Hall, a former strategy director at the Department of Health and Social Care, for the Engage Britain charity. Concerns over the state of the workforce came top of its list as it investigated the public’s attitude towards health and social care services, which remain under pressure in the wake of the pandemic. “The workforce crisis in the NHS has clearly penetrated the public consciousness,” Hall writes. “The UK has long had significantly lower numbers of doctors and nurses per capita than comparable systems … More recently, the impact of working conditions is showing an increasing impact on the ability of the NHS to retain staff. Around 50 in every 10,000 staff working in hospital and community health services in June 2021 left the service within the next three months, citing work-life balance as the reason. This was a new record.” Analysis of NHS Digital figures found that at least 400 staff a week in England are leaving to improve their work-life balance. It comes alongside evidence of high turnover among social care workers. Recent estimates show more than a third (34%) of care workers left their roles in 2020-21. Earlier this month, former health secretary Jeremy Hunt told the government it had “missed an opportunity” to alleviate the workforce crisis in the NHS and social care, after rejecting the Commons health select committee’s recommendation to overhaul workforce planning. Staff shortages were the main driver of worker burnout, he said Engage Britain gathered a panel of people from across the country to identify attitudes and concerns towards health and social care services. Patient treatment, support for mental health issues and preventative healthcare were among the main issues identified. Care work and nursing were named as some of our most undervalued professions, with 69% saying more NHS staff are needed. One senior occupational therapist, speaking anonymously to the project, said she decided to pay for an expensive operation after injuring her knee because she had seen how overwhelmed the NHS had become. “Waiting for eight weeks might become 12 weeks, or more. Living on my own, I didn’t have anyone to help me, and relying on friends just didn’t feel right. It wasn’t a difficult decision to go private. I just felt lucky I was in the position where I could choose when others can’t. “I think people generally feel overworked and undervalued in the NHS. There are problems with recruitment and retention of staff. Some vacancies are unfilled for more than a year. The stress levels on staff in under-resourced teams is massive and it’s a major contributor to them struggling with their mental health and wellbeing. Ultimately, people make the decision to leave, or to take early retirement, or seek other careers.” Jenny Bevan, 74, from Bath, said she was left fearful of returning to hospital after she sought treatment for a hiatus hernia in 2018. She said she felt staff shortages and other stresses on the NHS had played a major role. “The surgery went well, but afterwards I was left in the recovery room for hours. There appeared to be only one nurse and, as the day wore on, the number of patients grew and grew. “I was anxious because my granddaughter had all my personal belongings and didn’t know where I was. But the nurse wouldn’t let her in to see me. She seemed stressed and clearly needed more help. “When I had to go to the toilet, I was not allowed to get out of bed so I had to use a bedpan which spilled over and it was just awful. I was eventually transferred to a ward for dementia patients. I was in considerable pain but was told I’d have to wait for the doctor as the nurse wasn’t qualified to give strong painkillers.” Julian McCrae, Engage Britain’s director, said frontline health and care workers were now “running on empty” and a plan for boosting the workforce was overdue. “NHS workers across the country have spoken to us about feeling overstretched, undervalued and struggling to get support in a chaotic system,” he said. “We can’t allow staff to burn out, while putting patients at risk of mistakes or spiralling downwards as they wait months for treatment. The government must act quickly to expand its promise of reform, based on listening to the people who use or work in the system every day. Only answers rooted in real experiences can deliver health and care that works for us all.”",News/Society,"Stressed NHS staff in England quit at record 400 a week, fuelling fears over care quality",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/26/stressed-nhs-staff-quit-at-record-rate-of-400-a-week-fuelling-fears-over-care-quality
2/26/2022,"When the up-and-coming north London singer Bakar broke through in 2019, it was with a charming retro love song, Hell N Back. Breezy, brass-laden but sprinkled with enough drug references to maintain a respectable edge, Hell N Back channelled the vintage multicultural London sass of a young Lily Allen; its horns and overindulgence spoke of a love for Amy Winehouse. Bakar’s was a distinctive London voice making an uncommon splash in the US (200m-plus streams), earning props, mentoring and even some catwalk action from the late Virgil Abloh, among other early adopters. The son of a Tanzanian mother who relocated to Camden, Abubakar Baker Shariff-Farr had other strings to his bow, too. In 2017, his debut single was a snaggle-toothed indie rock cut called Big Dreams, which sounded like Gorillaz in the raw, all punky delivery and melodic bounce – more of a Blur tune, in fact (both bands involve Damon Albarn). On Nobody’s Home, Bakar’s debut album proper, there are nods both to Blur’s Parklife and Amy Winehouse’s song Tears Dry on Their Own, as well as Keane’s Somewhere Only We Know; Camden, where both Blur and Winehouse propped up bars, is a constant backdrop, as is its leafier neighbour up the hill, Hampstead, NW3, where the 28-year-old Bakar now lives. Growing up with hip-hop in one ear and skinny-trousered indie rock in the other, between grime and electronics, punk and pop, Bakar nonchalantly uses “white stripes up his nose/ Seven Nation Army” as a drug metaphor on a tune called Noun. He’s even got lyrical time for Will & Grace. But there are also traumatised story-songs such as Change of Heart, in which Bakar leaves names noticeably blank with the omertà of a drill rapper (“it was me and ___/ Back when he was free”) and songs where gospel backing vocals break bread with words about Bakar’s Islamic faith. One of the very best songs here, The Mission, finds Bakar and the track’s producer, SebastiAn, attempting to bend twinkly Tame Impala keyboard rock into something like R&B. Its plea for racial justice has a wry tinge to it. “All I ever hear is people talkin’ about how bad nepotism is. Do you know how badly I want some nepotism in my life?” Bakar seethes in the outro. There has been much talk over the years of a post-genre world, which is really a world in which musical heritage, skin colour, limiting orthodoxies and personal preferences are all definitively decoupled, one where the rapper Dave can play acoustic guitar at the Brits ceremony (as he did recently) and no one bats an eyelid. It is this future, in which there are no lanes to stray out of, which Bakar embraces, somewhat unevenly, but with aplomb, a more tuneful north London analogue to south London’s genre-masher-in-chief, King Krule. Throughout Nobody’s Home, love remains a strong suit for Bakar. The sweet-natured NW3 imagines him shacking up with his chosen one – via the alliteration and cadences of hip-hop. “In NW, I might end up with you,” he croons. “Think I found the north-west one, the best one.” But much of this record’s short and sharp 14-track, 48-minute duration is given over to various kinds of guitar-borne anomie – London stories, Bakar stories. The anger rings particularly true. Ginger Pubes is a hollered, phlegmy, heart-on-sleeve punk tune. “I keep fucking it up, I do,” he yells. Bakar’s angst is an etiolated thing, divided up between every-guy situations – sometimes accompanied by common-or-garden music – and the more intriguing complexities of his own story. He hasn’t seen his dad in 15 years, he confides on Youthenasia; he’s more angry about it than his mother is. The title of this debut throws down a gauntlet: who belongs where, and why? This is, ultimately, an album that has a spectacularly strong sense of place – London, NW1 and NW3 – and some very definitive British musical reference points, which nonetheless wonders, eloquently, where home is. Bakar mulls his immigrant experience (the bruised whispers of Not From Here) and, on the album’s sophisticated final track, Build Me a Way, he wishes for “a way home” – spiritually more than geographically. But even as he advocates for riots and freedom (Riot, Free), Bakar does so while presenting as someone entirely at home in their own skin, one whose musical tastes might not match other people’s assumptions. That’s a problem for other people, not him.",Arts/Music,Bakar: Nobody’s Home review – a spectacularly strong sense of place,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/26/bakar-nobodys-home-review-a-spectacularly-strong-sense-of-place
2/26/2022,"International students studying at medical schools in Dnipro are seeking routes out of Ukraine as Russian troops move across the country. Explosions were heard in the central Ukrainian city early on Thursday morning after Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale offensive on the country. About 2,000 foreign nationals study at Dnipro Medical Institute, a number of whom responded to a Guardian callout for voices on the ground. Among them was Zohir Ali, 22, from Manchester, who has been studying dentistry there for three years. He spoke from a private coach travelling towards Lviv, packed with 49 students from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, nearly 24 hours into the journey. Other passengers included two dogs – a chihuahua and a white labradoodle – both owned by students. The coach was arranged at short notice by the medical student agency that supports his studies abroad, at a cost of $150 (about £110) a person, leaving at 6pm on Thursday. Ali, who is in regular contact with his parents, brother and sister back in the UK, said: “Everyone’s trying to remain as positive as they can. The decision to leave last night was rushed, and we didn’t have time to gather all our stuff. “Students have left a lot of their belongings, along with most of their work, which they are worried will go to waste. I was only able to pack two bags. The bus company recommended we don’t take any heavy luggage with us. “Before we got to the bus things were quiet, no one really spoke a word. Students are worried about whether they will ever come back to finish their degrees, or if they will get their credentials to transfer to other international universities. Will they have to start from scratch again? Right now, I just want to be home.” Ali said he had been told by the British embassy that he would be able to cross the border into Poland, and so he would stay on the bus after it drops off other students in Lviv who have not yet received similar guarantees from their embassies. He plans to book a flight back to the UK at the first opportunity once he is over the border. Adam Hadouiri, an 18-year-old Moroccan who is studying at Dnipro State Medical University, remains at his hostel in the Sobornyi district with about 50 other students. “Everyone is panicked and stressed. Most people want to head to Lviv, avoiding Kyiv, of course, as that is risky,” he said on Friday. “I am waiting for the embassy to act. If I want to go to Poland [but without the right accreditation], they could stop me and prevent me from entering. So basically I have been waiting for the embassy to guarantee I can pass like others have.” The streets had been quiet since explosions were heard on Thursday, Hadouiri said, and a curfew was set to come into force from 10pm. He was yet to see military presence, only police officers and ambulance services. “I don’t see a lot of people going out,” he said. “The streets are empty. Everyone is indoors or searching for shelters to hide in. Right now, we are just waiting for sirens. I’m ready to go to my shelter as soon as I hear them.” Hadouiri, who is from Morocco’s capital, Rabat, has found a public shelter about five minutes away from his hostel, which he feels is safer than hiding in the basement. Rita Ansah, a 20-year-old medical student from Ghana, has lived in Dnipro since 2019. The Ghanaian embassy arranged for buses to transport students to Romania, she said, but they were cancelled on Friday afternoon after drivers refused to undertake the journey. She said she had since been told by the embassy to organise her own route out of the country. “I’m feeling quite alone,” she told the Guardian from student accommodation near the city centre. “Most of the people on my floor are Ukrainians and Moroccans, so we don’t speak a common language. Right now I’m just focusing on packing, although I will have to leave most of my clothes behind. We have been advised to only take a small backpack.” Her plan is to book a public bus to Poland leaving on Monday, for $50, which is thought to be the safest form of travel as rail lines may be bombing targets.",News/World news,‘I want to be home:’ overseas students in Ukraine seek safe routes out,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/i-want-to-be-home-overseas-students-in-ukraine-seek-safe-routes-out
2/26/2022,"He looked gaunt and unshaven after another sleepless night under Russian attack and bombardment. But Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, struck a defiant tone in a video address on Saturday morning. “I’m here,” he said simply. And he was – in the centre of Kyiv, three days on from Vladimir Putin’s invasion, unbowed and going nowhere. “Good morning everybody! Ukrainians: there’s a lot of fake information online that I call on our army to lay down arms, and that there’s an evacuation,” he said. “I’m here. We won’t lay down our arms. We will defend our state, our territory, our Ukraine, our children. That’s all I have to say. Glory to Ukraine!” Zelenskiy had chosen a backdrop for his Telegram channel video: the capital’s House of Chimeras. The art nouveau building designed by the Polish architect Władysław Horodecki is immediately identifiable. It boasts mythical figures and elephant-head gargoyles. The address – Bankova – is Ukraine’s equivalent of Downing Street. A hundred metres down the road is the presidential administration building. Zelenskiy made another video address on Friday night, surrounded by his defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, the country’s PM, and senior advisers. “I am staying in the government quarters together with others,” he said. He told his fellow countrymen that it was likely to be another bruising night, as Russian forces tried to encircle and to seize Kyiv. “The enemy has designated me as target number one, and my family as target number two,” he said, urging his citizens to resist with unity and strength. The longer Zelenskiy manages to hold out, the more heroic a figure he appears, at least in the eyes of a growing number of Ukrainians. “I didn’t like him before and didn’t vote for him. But I now see him with new respect,” Olga Bileychuk said, speaking from the western city of Lviv. “He’s doing a good job.” Kristina Berdynskykh, one of Ukraine’s top journalists, was also praising. “I have a lot of complaints against Zelenskiy over his domestic politics. But the way he behaves during the offensive of absolute evil against Ukraine is real political leadership and tremendous courage,” she tweeted late on Friday. The former TV actor and comedian won a landslide victory in the spring 2019 presidential election. He promised to bring peace to the east of the country and to negotiate with Vladimir Putin. Three years later, he finds himself at war with Russia, and leading an against the odds struggle against Kremlin occupation and national extinction. In the run-up to this week’s invasion Zelenskiy’s ratings had fallen. One critique was that he has lagged behind events – offering to declare Ukraine a neutral country, for example, once it was too late and Russian bombs were already falling. There were disagreements with the international community too over the threat from Moscow. For weeks, the Biden administration warned Putin had assembled an invasion force on Ukraine’s borders and was preparing to go in. Zelenskiy demurred. He shrugged off predictions of doom and criticised London and Washington for removing their diplomats to Lviv. There was no reason to panic, he said. “He’s always two or three steps behind what is happening. He can’t get out of his square box,” one former senior government official said. “It’s like it’s theatre, not fact. The situation is life and death, a real tragedy for thousands of people.” Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, advised him badly, the official added. And yet Zelenskiy has behaved with courage and extraordinary resilience in the dark hours since Russia’s military offensive began at 5am on Thursday. The US government and – according to sources – Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, have both offered to get Zelenskiy out of Ukraine to prevent his capture by Russians. He has refused to go. “The fight is here. I need ammunition, not a ride,” Zelenskiy said, according to US intelligence officials, quoted in the Washington Post. The answer suggests the president has not lost his sense of humour, visible in his recent iPhone videos, delivered with a weary smile. His family has been taken to a place of safety, he said on Friday. Zelenskiy’s fate over the coming days is grimly uncertain. There is no doubt that Putin is determined to capture Kyiv and to remove Zelenskiy’s pro-western and pro-Nato administration. Moscow’s apparent goal is to install a Russian puppet regime, as in separatist Donetsk, and to annex de facto a vast area Putin considers to be “historical Russia”. When he sent in the tanks this week Putin claimed he was undertaking a mission to “demilitarise and denazify” Ukraine. On Friday, Putin called Ukraine’s leaders fascists and drug addicts. Ever since the Maidan uprising in 2014 against president Viktor Yanukovych, Kremlin state channels have suggested the country is run by far-right extremists. The claim is ridiculous. Zelenskiy is a native Russian speaker – something he showed off in his moving address to the Russian people on Wednesday evening, hours before the invasion began. He is also Jewish. He lost relatives in the Holocaust and his grandfather fought against Hitler. His friends and senior advisers come from TV show business. For now, at least, Zelenskiy appears buoyant. In his most recent video address on Saturday he said Ukraine has successfully fought off “enemy attacks.” “We are defending our country, our land,” he said, pointing out Kyiv remains under government control. He added: “The occupiers wanted to capture our capital and install their puppets like Donetsk. We broke their idea.” He added: “I want everyone in Russia to hear me. Everybody. Hundreds of captured soldiers who are here in Ukraine don’t know why they were sent here to kill people or be killed. People need to tell the government why the war has to be stopped, more people from your country will stay alive.” Kremlin brute force and air power may yet prevail. But Zelenskiy has already earned his place in history, as the leader of nation under fire, fighting for its survival.",News/World news,Volodymyr Zelenskiy stands defiant in face of Russian attack,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/volodymyr-zelenskiy-ukraine-stands-defiant-in-face-of-russian-attack
