The company has sent a letter to partner stores saying the ransomware attack, which has crippled its IT and communications systems, could lead to supply issues until “the end of March at the earliest” as it “cannot safely process orders or dispatch goods”.  The warning message, sent out through the groceries wholesaler Nisa, said KP Snacks was going to limit the size of orders to retailers so it could “manage what stock we do have”, according to the website Better Retailing which first published news of the attack. “On Friday 28 January we became aware that we were unfortunately victims of a ransomware incident,”said KP Snacks in a statement. “As soon as we became aware of the incident, we enacted our cybersecurity response plan and engaged a leading forensic information technology firm and legal counsel to assist us in our investigation. “Our internal IT teams continue to work with third-party experts to assess the situation. We have been continuing to keep our colleagues, customers, and suppliers informed of any developments and apologise for any disruption this may have caused.” The hackers are threatening to release information stolen from the company’s IT systems in order to try to force it into making a payment to decrypt its files to continue operations. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre has warned that even if firms pay up “there is no guarantee that you will get access to your computer, or your files”. In October, the crisp giant Walkers was hit by IT issues that resulted in gaps on shelves that lasted through to the end of December.

2/3/2022,"BT has entered exclusive talks with the US pay-TV giant Discovery to create a joint venture business that will include BT Sport, which has rights to sports including the Premier League and Champions League. The joint venture, which BT expects will be operational later this year subject to regulatory approval, ends almost a year of uncertainty over the future of the telecoms company’s decade-old pay-TV sport operation.  The decision to combine with Discovery, which in the past has considered bidding for the UK TV rights to the Premier League, is a blow to the sports streaming business Dazn. Backed by the billionaire Sir Leonard Blavatnik, Dazn, dubbed the “Netflix of sports”, had pushed hard for a deal to buy BT Sport to fuel its plans to grow in the UK. “The proposed joint venture with Discovery would create an exciting new sports broadcasting entity for the UK and would act as a perfect home for our BT Sport business,” said Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s Consumer division. “With a shared ambition for growth, as well as the combination of our world class sports assets along with Discovery’s premium sports and entertainment content, our customers will benefit from even more content in more places.” BT, which has had to seek clearance from the Premier League and Champions League to push through the change in ownership, has also extended a reciprocal channel supply deal with Sky that is crucial to its sports broadcasting business until 2030. The telecoms company has spent billions on sports rights to drive the growth of BT Sport since it was launched a decade ago to stem the loss of millions of broadband customers enticed by its rival Sky’s offers bundling internet connectivity with sport and entertainment programming. The business succeeded in its job, although it only has a few million customers and turns just a small profit, and BT is now focused on its £15bn plans to roll out next generation broadband and 5G mobile networks across the UK. “Today sees two important strategic partnership announcements on how BT moves forward in the fast-evolving content and TV business. The agreement in principle with Sky will provide our customers more choice and more flexibility for the next decade,” said Philip Jansen, chief executive at BT. “Separately, we are excited at the prospect of a new joint venture between BT Sport and Eurosport UK as we enter into exclusive discussions with Discovery.” Dazn said its plans for the UK remain unfinished but the deal it was discussing with BT Sport was not commercially viable. “We remain fully committed to growing our business and investing in the UK, as you will see in the near future,” said Kevin Mayer, chairman of Dazn. “On this occasion, however, the deal for BT Sport became uneconomical for Dazn. However, we respect that BT chose a different strategic path and wish BT, BT Sport and Discovery all the best for the future.”",News/Business,BT enters exclusive talks with Discovery on BT Sports,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/bt-enters-exclusive-talks-with-discovery-on-bt-sports
2/3/2022,"A Gunai/Kurnai woman who spent a decade working as a police officer has won Australia’s richest literary prize, for her “powerful” memoir detailing her experiences with racism and domestic violence. Veronica Gorrie, who worked in the Victorian and Queensland police forces, collected the $100,000 Victorian prize for literature at the Victorian Premier’s literary awards for her book Black and Blue: A Memoir of Racism and Resilience.  The memoir, which was selected by Guardian Australia as one of the top 25 Australian books of 2021, also won the $25,000 category for Indigenous writing. The Melbourne-based writer Melissa Manning won the fiction category for her debut Smokehouse, a collection on interlinked stories set in her birthplace of southern Tasmania. Announcing the winners at Melbourne’s The Wheeler Centre on Thursday, Victoria’s creative industries minister, Danny Pearson, said the awards celebrated emerging artists as well as established writers. “The winning works tell stories that are urgent, eye-opening, poignant and powerful, and reflect the extraordinary talent we have here in Victoria and across the country,” he said. Gorrie’s Black and Blue documents her childhood in Bung Yarnda (Lake Tyers) in eastern Victoria and her early adult life as a struggling single mother and conflicted rookie cop. The book confronts corruption, racism, domestic violence and tackles a number of failures in Australian policing history, including the notorious 2004 Palm Island death in custody of Cameron Doomadgee, which fuelled a series of riots and ultimately led to a $30m class action settlement to victims 14 years later. Gorrie, who joined the police force in order to break the cycle of fear that law enforcement authorities had instilled in her family for generations, was medically discharged from the force in 2011. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The prize judges praised Gorrie for her simple yet captivating style of storytelling. “Free from pretension and condescension, through telling her story Gorrie challenges the reader to ask what they can do in their personal and professional lives to confront racism in all its guises,” the judges wrote. “The work is a demonstrated tale of strength, resilience and humour in settings where none of those attributes would normally exist.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The judges described Manning’s winning collection Smokehouse as “atmospheric, mesmerising stories by an incredibly skilled writer”. “Manning has created an entire world in this small Tasmanian town; a place glistening with pathos, empathy and the essence of human connection,” the judges said. “With an innovative structure, perfectly spare prose, and great emotional weight, Smokehouse is a celebration of ordinary lives made extraordinary.” The non-fiction prize went to the western Sydney artist, lawyer and women’s rights advocate Amani Haydar for her personal account of domestic violence, The Mother Wound. In 2015 Haydar’s mother was stabbed to death by the writer’s father. Judges described The Mother Wound as a heroic and critical portrayal of a “diasporic patriarchal cultural milieu as it intersects with a broader Australian patriarchal culture and legal system”. Dylan Van Den Berg, a Palawa writer from north-east Tasmania, won the drama prize for his play Milk, and the Victorian poet Maria Takolander won for her collection of poetry Trigger Warning. The prize for young adult writing was won by Felicity Castagna for her novel Girls in Boys’ Cars.

2/3/2022,"After a tumultuous climax to the 2021 Formula One season that ended in both sound and fury, it is Lewis Hamilton’s continued silence that has defined the winter. With the new season rapidly approaching, the British driver’s future in F1 remains unknown and ostensibly undecided. As the FIA wrestles with an inquiry into the events in Abu Dhabi, it is Hamilton’s absence that looms over the sport, his silence speaking volumes. Seven times an F1 world champion but beaten to the title in controversial circumstances at the season finale at Yas Marina by Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, Hamilton left Abu Dhabi angry and disillusioned. He believed the race had been manipulated in Verstappen’s favour and so disenchanted was he with the way it had played out, he had lost trust in the rules being applied fairly. His Mercedes principal, Toto Wolff, confirmed shortly afterwards that his future in F1 was in doubt.  From Hamilton himself there has been all but nothing since he congratulated Verstappen immediately after that race. He has barely been seen in public and his usually exuberant use of social media has ceased completely. Given his competitive nature, his ability to ultimately overcome and move on from setbacks, it is hard to imagine Hamilton would allow this event, albeit one of crushing proportions, to derail his attempt to take an eighth title this year. F1 insiders are cautiously optimistic that he will indeed return but crucial to that decision will surely be that the 37-year-old has confidence in an even-handed and transparent application of the rules. Hamilton and many of the sport’s fans, also disillusioned by the events in Abu Dhabi, demand a level playing field. Regaining trust in how the sport is run seems paramount and the FIA investigation is key to that. At the heart of the enquiry are the actions of the race director Michael Masi, whose future hangs in the balance. Verstappen passed Hamilton for victory on the final lap after Masi improvised decisions around the rules in order to ensure the season’s final race did not finish behind a safety car. There was consternation, confusion and for all that Verstappen was a worthy world champion, distaste and disenchantment for many at how it had happened. Sources inside the FIA insist the sport’s governing body is investigating dispassionately, pursuing a thorough examination of exactly whether the rules were followed. Yet regardless, change is still coming. Peter Bayer is the FIA’s new head of F1, heading the inquiry, and will draw up proposed changes to present to the teams. Last week he admitted that there was a “possibility” Masi could be replaced. Yet the indications are that this seems unlikely. Certainly at very least there seems widespread agreement across the paddock, within the FIA and confirmed by Bayer that Masi can no longer do the job alone and will need assistants to reduce the burden. Equally there is consensus that safety car rules must be revised, to leave a clear protocol for how it would be used if, as the teams desire, races are not to finish under the safety car and that the ability for team principals to lobby the race director live over the radio as events unfold would be removed. The unseemly impression that barracking from the heads of Mercedes and Red Bull was influencing Masi in Abu Dhabi did F1 no favours in the eyes of many who had simply tuned in to watch drivers not their bosses do battle. Mercedes also remain silent on the subject, focusing on their new car, but the team felt Hamilton’s pain with the same piercing sense of injustice and without doubt they too will have strong expectations of the FIA presenting not only a clear review of what happened in Abu Dhabi but more importantly that Bayer’s proposals are a blueprint to prevent a repeat of the events. An ambition that should be shared by all, for the sport to draw a line under 2021. The FIA will present its findings to the teams at the F1 commission meeting on 14 February and is expected to make them public shortly afterwards. However should the FIA not do so, it may indicate serious dissent may remain from some participants. Four days after the F1 commission, Mercedes will launch their new car on 18 February when it would be expected they will present Hamilton alongside it, if his mind is made up. When he finally ends the silence it must be hoped it is to confirm he will indeed race on. It is hard not to imagine after all that he will feel there is unfinished business to address but for now all the pressure and the scrutiny lies firmly with the FIA. This is perhaps the greatest and most high-profile test of governance the organisation has faced in more than a decade,it sorely needs to get it right and not only for Hamilton’s sake. Confidence in the sport’s ability to deliver equitable racing was severely rocked in Abu Dhabi, restoring it will go some way to placating fans who felt entertainment and spectacle had taken precedence over fair play. The sport’s reputation was tarnished and before a wheel is turned in anger this year the furore around 2021 must be put to rest.",Sport/Sport,Lewis Hamilton’s future shrouded in doubt as new F1 season looms | Giles Richards,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/03/lewis-hamiltons-future-shrouded-in-doubt-as-new-f1-season-looms
2/3/2022,"For several weeks, millions of Britons have said or heard words to the effect of: “Surely Boris Johnson can’t survive this.” And yet he has, batting away Sue Gray’s non-report after the Metropolitan police helped gut it, morphing daily into a plummy-mouthed Donald Trump, littering an already mucky political world with lies and entirely bogus smears about Keir Starmer and Jimmy Savile. Yet Johnson is now treated by his growing band of critics as a freakish aberration who has disgraced the esteemed office of prime minister. His predecessor, Theresa May, who built her own career on bashing migrants – an approach that culminated in the Windrush scandal – has won plaudits for castigating Johnson in the House of Commons. But Johnson is no grotesque interloper: his behaviour and attitudes are emblematic of the British establishment. If our ruling institutions have a shared culture, it’s entitlement and shamelessness, a conviction that wrongdoing should meet consequences only if you are poor and powerless. When Johnson solemnly lectured the nation to abide by the rules while presiding over illicit parties in his Haçienda-on-Thames, his thought process is not hard to imagine. He must have believed that the rules had to accommodate his needs, rather than vice versa.  It’s the same attitude that drove the expenses scandal: the MPs who railed against “benefit cheats” while milking hard-pressed taxpayers believed they were not sufficiently remunerated, certainly not compared with the party donors – the City hotshots and top lawyers they clinked champagne glasses with. Why shouldn’t they just help themselves to extras they deserved? A handful of MPs went to prison, but for most, being personally winded by some adverse newspaper headlines did not prove a roadblock to their future political careers. The revolving door between the fourth estate and politics has enjoyed a bit-part in this scandal. The career of the former journalist Allegra Stratton did not survive being demoted to being Johnson’s human shield. But perhaps she felt invincible after her false portrayal of a single mother as a benefit “scrounger” on Newsnight in 2012 led to 27,000 complaints and a BBC apology, but did nothing to impede her media career. Compare and contrast that with Newsnight colleagues who attempted to scrutinise the wealthy, well-connected Jimmy Savile just months before, and claimed they paid with their BBC careers. But spreading myths and outright lies about benefit claimants, refugees or Muslims is largely consequence-free. It’s quite a different story when media figures target the powerful. When, in December, Boris Johnson sought to distract from “partygate” by escalating the war on “middle-class drug users”, he merely emphasised the establishment’s unofficial motto: rules for thee and not for me. It made his recent suggestion in parliament that the Labour frontbench are drug takers all the more bizarre: he’s admitted to taking drugs; so has his deputy, Dominic Raab; and so has Michael Gove – to cocaine, indeed, on several occasions. Coke may coat parliamentary latrines, but our country remains one in which Black drugs offenders are 1.5 times more likely to be jailed than a white offender, not that the latter group will include politicians. Our scandal-convulsed prime minister once boasted that nobody “stuck up for the bankers as much as I did” after the crash. Indeed, Johnson has been a longstanding and unapologetic champion of the wealthiest, who he once described as a “put-upon minority” who made a “heroic contribution”. They barely needed his defence. Following the financial crisis, 324 financiers were convicted of crimes after the financial system nearly collapsed in the US. In the UK, the number of bankers who went to prison was just five. Again: terrible behaviour, minimal consequences. There are good reasons why members of the establishment may believe their power and connections are a bullet-proof vest. Consider the fact that in the UK, you are 23 times more likely to be prosecuted for benefit fraud than tax fraud . Benefit fraud may inflict far less economic and social harm, but our society hysterically demands that it’s the sins of the poor that must be punished. When Cressida Dick faced demands to resign after her officers attacked a vigil for Sarah Everard last March – a rather more heavy-handed approach than the officers stationed at No 10 offered when government officials boozily frolicked – she must have known she’d brazen it out. After all, the Met had already avoided full accountability for police spies having relationships with women under false pretences and stealing the identities of dead children , the unlawful killing in 2009 of Ian Tomlinson, and the 2005 shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes – the latter in an operation headed by none other than Dick herself. Johnson may understandably be bewildered that he is suddenly facing the level of scrutiny he always deserved after getting away with so much for so long. In fact, much of the fourth estate has conspired to help construct his jovial, amiable persona. From the Evening Standard editor who was a personal friend when he was London mayor to Theresa May appointing him foreign secretary, he has always been helped to power. Now he is viewed as a liability. His support is melting away like a marshmallow over a flame. But self-serving attempts to paint him as an anomaly should be fiercely resisted. Johnson is the British establishment in its undiluted and unapologetic form. If he gets away with this, it will be another illustration of the truth that is as old as the establishment itself: that consequences are for the little guy, not for the powerful.

2/3/2022,"The government is under mounting pressure to tackle Britain’s worsening cost of living crisis, with inflation at the highest rate for 30 years and a record increase in household energy bills expected from April. Here are six charts highlighting the scale of the challenge as the squeeze hits the poorest households hardest.  Inflation as measured by the official consumer prices index (CPI) jumped to 5.4% in December, the highest rate since March 1992. However, the Bank of England has said the official gauge for the annual increase in living costs is expected to rise further still, with a peak close to 6% expected by April. Some economists have warned that inflation could rise further and remain higher for longer than expected. The increase reflects a snapback in demand for goods and services after lockdown, when prices fell sharply, as well as the impact from supply chain disruption due to Covid-19 hitting factory production and global trade. Advanced economies around the world are dealing with similar problems, though the UK has added disruption from Brexit. Most economists expect inflation to ease as Covid disruption abates, although there are warnings of persistently higher rates than in the past. Prices are rising at similar rates for richer and poorer households, according to official figures. However, household income levels influence personal experiences of inflation – an issue raised by the food and poverty campaigner Jack Monroe. Poorer households find it harder to cope with similar rates of inflation to richer families as essentials, such as energy and food, form a larger proportion of their shopping basket than discretionary items. According to the Resolution Foundation, on average the lowest-income families spend twice as much proportionately on food and housing bills as the richest. “The decisions people have to make are made harder,” said Dave Innes, head of economics at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation poverty charity. “If you’re already spending mainly on essentials, where are you going to cut back if prices are going up?” UK petrol and diesel prices have hit their highest levels on record in recent months, hitting motorists and adding to business costs, driven by a sharp rise in global oil prices after lockdown. Having plunged from about $60 a barrel in February 2020 to about $20 just two months later in the early stages of the pandemic – and with some prices for US oil dropping below zero – the price of Brent crude has since risen to the highest in seven years at almost $90 a barrel. The government has frozen fuel duty for 11 years, saving the average car driver a cumulative £1,600. However, critics say the policy has added to carbon emissions, while more could have been done to invest in greener electric vehicles. Gas prices on the wholesale market have soared to record highs in recent months, fuelled by soaring demand after lockdown, cold weather draining reserves and lower levels of wind over the summer affecting renewable energy production. The surge has triggered an energy crisis across several major nations and led to almost 30 smaller UK household suppliers of gas and electricity going bust in recent months. Consumers have been relatively insulated so far by the government’s energy-price cap, although that will change dramatically in April after Ofgem, the industry regulator, recalculates the limit to reflect wholesale market prices. Households are expected to see their gas and electricity bills go up by about 50% from April, an increase worth about £600 for an average annual utility bill, taking the total cost to almost £2,000 a year before any measures from the government to reduce the impact. It comes after a previous record jump when the cap was last altered in October, when prices went up by about £139 for those on default tariffs. Britain’s poorest households are expected to be hit hardest by the increase in energy bills as they spend proportionately more of their income on energy. According to the Resolution Foundation, the poorest will see their energy spend rise from 8.5% to 12% of their total household budget – three times the proportion for the richest. While households across the board will be hit, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates the situation is worse for particular families. It estimates that low-income single-adult households could be forced to spend 54% of their income on gas and electricity. It comes as the government prepares to increase national insurance contributions for workers in the same month, leading to calls from some Tories to scrap the tax raid to ease the pressure on living costs. While experts say there are fairer ways to increase taxes than through national insurance, the plan is relatively progressive and they warn that scrapping it would be a badly targeted way of helping the poorest households with their energy bills. High rates of inflation are eroding the spending power of workers’ pay packets, with economists warning that average weekly earnings after tax will fall in real terms in 2022. According to official figures, inflation-adjusted pay fell in November and has sunk below the pre-financial crisis peak for wages recorded in 2008. Ministers argue that the lowest-paid will see an inflation-busting 6.6% rise in the national living wage to £9.50 an hour from April. However, average pay is expected to shrink this year. The Institute for Fiscal Studies expects the average worker will be almost £13,000 a year worse off by the middle of the 2020s than under a scenario whereby wages continued to rise at pre-2008 financial crisis trend rates. Real pay had been rising steadily for decades prior to the banking crash, although it has now fallen on three occasions in the last decade alone.",News/Business,In numbers: what is fuelling Britain’s cost of living crisis?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/in-numbers-britains-cost-of-living-crisis
2/3/2022,"Saba Kumaritashvili shook his head in frustration as he buckled through the finish line on Wednesday night after the second of two runs in the opening practice session at the Yanqing National Sliding Centre, the sparkling new venue nestled in the tree-lined southern foot of Xiaohaituo Mountain.  Even after barreling down the sharp turns of an icy track at frightening speeds exceeding 120kph, the Georgian luger came in dead last in his group among those who completed both attempts, each time finishing more than three seconds behind the pacesetter, Wolfgang Kindl of Austria. He could not hide his disappointment as he marched past a cluster of reporters in the mixed zone, paused for a beat to consider speaking, before hurrying off toward the dressing room to look toward Saturday, when the men’s singles competition begins in earnest. But while the temporary sour of his first taste of sliding’s biggest stage will pass, Kumaritashvili’s participation at these Beijing Games is a triumph that embodies the resilience and courage at the foundation of the Olympics. Twelve years ago in Vancouver, Kumaritashvili’s cousin was fatally injured after crashing in a training session just hours before the opening ceremony. Nodar Kumaritashvili was 21, same as Saba today, and one practice run away from his Olympic debut when he lost control on the insidious 13th turn at Whistler Sliding Centre, a course that had already prompted whispers among the competitors over safety concerns because of the breakneck speeds it was abetting. Nodar’s sled was traveling at nearly 145kmh when it catapulted off the surface and over the sidewall near the finish line, propelling his 176lb form into an unprotected metal support pole by the end of the track. He was pronounced dead less than an hour after he was airlifted to a Whistler hospital and resuscitation efforts failed, becoming the fourth athlete to die in preparations for a Winter Olympics after the British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypecki, the Australian skier Ross Milne and and the Swiss speed skier Nicolas Bochatay. The first on-track fatality in 35 years rocked the sport to its foundation and generated worldwide media attention and sympathy. But the danger being laid bare did nothing to dissuade Saba from following the family trade. The fastest of Winter Olympics events simply runs in the blood. Saba’s great grandfather, Aleko, marshalled the construction of Georgia’s first luge training track in the early 1970s, and then a more complete track a few years later. Aleko then served as head coach of the national team. Saba’s grandfather Felix and uncle David were both highly decorated lugers when Georgia was part of the Soviet Union. His father is only the latest in a line of family members to preside over the national luge federation. Nodar would have become the first of this proud lineage to officially compete in an Olympic Games had he made it through that fifth and final practice run in Canada. Now it will be Saba, who has climbed to No 47 in the world rankings since making his debut at last year’s Nations Cup in Sigulda and has arrived in China as the lone athlete from a sliding sport on Georgia’s nine-person delegation. “Every generation of our family had at least one luge sportsman, and now my father and I are continuing this tradition and following Nodar’s footsteps,” he told the Associated Press after qualifying for the Beijing field. “Thinking about him is painful but gives me strength as well.” He added: “I think every sportsman’s goal and dream is to be competing in the Olympic Games, so two years ago I decided to achieve this goal. And here I am.”",Sport/Sport,The Georgian luger racing 12 years after his cousin’s death at Olympics | Bryan Armen Graham,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/03/winter-olympics-luge-beijing-saba-kumaritashvili-georgia
2/3/2022,"Edmund White’s latest book – his 30th, by my count – bears the subtitle “Another posthumous novel”. This alludes not only to the fact that White has continued to write prolifically after suffering multiple strokes, but also to those critics who have dismissed his most recent novels as an old-school irrelevance to the brave new world of contemporary queer fiction. The acerbic preface to this new one suggests that we’re about to read an autobiographical account of an affair, written by a ravaged old queen who must surely be White himself. However, the opening pages of the book itself plunge us straight – no pun intended – into a turbulent, picaresque and obviously fictional narrative.  The year is 2050; a married couple are holed up in a remote Swiss chalet while the husband recovers from a skiing accident. To while away this enforced convalescence, they decide to write a pair of complementary memoirs that will describe their previous sexual careers with absolute honesty. In order to make the game more exquisite, they will take it in turns to read these confessions out loud – meaning, of course, that we will be allowed to eavesdrop. We quickly discover that this is no ordinary marriage. The wife, Constance, is in her early 30s, while her husband, Ruggero, is at least four decades older; she is an African American orphan, while he is a legendarily well-connected (not to mention well-hung) Sicilian aristocrat who also happens to be a world-famous baroque harpsichordist. Oh, and the sometime lover of a deceased and forgotten gay novelist called Edmund White. In the course of their readings, the couple work their way through pretty much every available combination of gender and lifestyle. Ruggero tends to focus on the visible and physical (he is obsessed with his prowess) while Constance – true to her name – is more concerned with the workings of fidelity. As the confessions unspool, the cracks in their marriage begin to show. Things get particularly sticky when we’re made privy to an email-by-email account of Ruggero’s obsessive two-year affair with the then octogenarian White. At this point, the Chinese boxes of White’s metafiction become ever more fantastically interlocked. Constance consults White’s (real) archive in Princeton to determine the (fictional) truth of Ruggero’s account of their affair; meanwhile, we are given a voyeur’s-eye view of Ruggero’s sado-masochistic romps with his besotted geriatric plaything. Of course, we can’t help but remember that it is White penning these pitiless descriptions of impotence and age, and it is perhaps in these truly hard to read passages that we glimpse the driving impulse behind the book. No matter how elaborately cultured or crudely pornographic the prose gets, it still crackles with a heartfelt insistence that the old and hungry have as much to tell us about the dynamics of sex as the young and sated. A fugue-like ending leads the central couple down ever stranger perspectives of self-discovery, into relationships that no one (least of all themselves) could have seen coming. If we really want to continue to put fiction at the service of liberation, White seems to be suggesting, then we might need to risk imagining ourselves in each and every sexual and emotional position in the book – no matter how abject or alien those positions might be. Back in the now-distant 1970s and 80s, White’s dazzling first quartet of novels forever enlarged what gay writing might do with its then newly found freedoms. With this latest report from the frontiers of desire, he has triumphantly dared to continue that project.
