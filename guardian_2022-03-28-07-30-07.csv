3/28/2022,"Lewis Hamilton and other drivers have made it clear they still have serious misgivings about racing in Saudi Arabia. Formula One is facing clear dissent and unease about the meeting’s future with Hamilton stating: “I am just looking forward to getting out.” The weekend had been dominated by a missile strike that hit Jeddah on Friday, 10 miles from the circuit that almost resulted in a driver boycott of the race. With distaste at the regime’s appalling human rights record and fears for the safety of their teams it took a four-hour meeting on Friday night before the drivers were ultimately placated and persuaded to race. Hamilton was believed to be one of the drivers strongly in favour of cancelling the race and after taking 10th place he only wanted to leave. “I am so happy the weekend is done,” he said, “I am so happy that everyone is safe, I am just looking forward to just getting out. I just want to go home.” The race was won by Red Bull’s Max Verstappen who confirmed that the matter was not closed and that the drivers would once more demand answers from F1 about a meeting that has signed a contract for a decade of more races. “We had a lot of guarantees that of course it would be safe but after this weekend all the drivers together we will speak with F1 and the team bosses to see what is happening for the future,” he said. F1 is enormously keen to keep racing in Saudi Arabia given the reported $900m contract they have to do so but the pushback from its drivers after this weekend is palpable. “Of course I am relieved [to have got through the weekend],” said McLaren’s Lando Norris. “It is a nervous place to be and you are going to have these nerves.” Carlos Sainz was third for Ferrari, Sergio Pérez fourth for Red Bull and George Russell fifth for Mercedes. Esteban Ocon was in sixth for Alpine, Lando Norris seventh for McLaren, with Pierre Gasly eighth for AlphaTauri and Magnussen ninth for Haas.

3/28/2022,"Iwas not sure if I had much of an appetite for an in-depth documentary about war, given that the horrors are ever-present in the 24-hour news cycle. But Falklands War: The Untold Story (Channel 4) marks 40 years since the conflict between Britain and Argentina, and this thorough, rigorous documentary is an exhaustive and engaging account of what happened, by many who were there. It is done with fittingly military precision, and takes the approach of a day-by-day countdown, talking viewers through key events via maps, charts and diagrams. This is useful as the action is explained at a pace that leaves little time for people less familiar with the history of it to catch up. It assumes a level of knowledge about the conflict already, and although there is the odd explanatory note, I imagine those with a solid understanding of military terms may feel more at ease with it. However, the story that this documentary aims to tell is not necessarily one that has been told before, and that allows for a gripping narrative to unravel. This was a British victory, but the film does not gloss over the cost of that, nor does it back away from the seemingly numerous occasions when that win was far from certain. Several contributors are speaking publicly about their roles for the first time, most notably Lt Col Michael Rose, the head of the SAS in the Falklands, whose steady tone belies a frankness about the operation and speaks candidly of its flaws. Rose calls the conflict “a command and control muddle from the start” and paints a picture of a fractured chain of command, ill-suited to the distance, conditions and demands of the South Atlantic terrain. The only orders he was given, he claims, were: “Please do the best you can.” Other senior figures describe the pitfalls of the British plan or, more crucially, the lack of a cohesive one. One key brigadier is indecisive by reputation, and the decisions he did make continue to baffle other senior commanders. There are many “should have” and “could have” and “maybe if” moments, and at least two scenarios which, had they played out even slightly differently, might have ended in victory for Argentina. One officer describes an evacuation in appalling weather, the loss of two helicopters, and the notion that had men been killed at this very early stage, on day 20 – as they very nearly were – the war might not have progressed. There are stories in which 10 minutes made all the difference to the outcome. The arrival of the British supply ship, the Atlantic Conveyor, on Argentina’s independence day, which was attacked in daylight by Argentinian forces resulting in the deaths of 12 sailors, is called “the biggest logistical disaster of the war”. The tiny, crucial twists and turns when it comes to planning and chance are fascinating. For all of the strategic detail, though, there are welcome touches of cultural analysis. The then foreign correspondent Max Hastings, who reported from the Falklands, paints a picture of Britain in the late 1970s and early 80s as fiercely divided, the manufacturing industry in the doldrums, riots in the cities. He recalls flag-waving and jingoism as the ships sailed from Southampton, people united behind the idea that the servicemen and women were “off to fight Johnny foreigner”. Some of the military figures compare it to their time in Northern Ireland, pointing out that to the public, by contrast, this looked like “a real war, against an enemy in uniform”. The candour and scope is impressive and decisions are examined from all sides. This is a British film, so naturally leans towards British personnel, but there are interviews with Argentinian combatants too, and accounts of what they were fighting for, and why. There are participants from across the ranks, with two particular standout moments. The first is when Rose listens, for the first time, to a recording of negotiations with Argentina, transmitted via satellite back to the UK, and hears his voice from 40 years ago. As his old self transmits one last crackling “over”, the present-day Rose holds a finger up and says, “End of the war.” It is powerful. The other is the focus on trauma, which dominates the final few minutes, as a medic and a private recall the fighting, and speak eloquently about the post-traumatic stress disorder they were left with. But when they talk about mistakes, one says, it is not to apportion blame. It is to learn lessons for the future, so they do not happen in the same way again.",Arts/Television & radio,Falklands War: The Untold Story review – this gripping documentary tells how Britain nearly lost,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/27/falklands-war-the-untold-story-review-this-gripping-documentary-tells-how-britain-nearly-lost
3/28/2022,"Gareth Southgate says it would be “hugely unfortunate” if Harry Kane was to break the England goalscoring record in a match where supporters were banned. The England captain scored his 49th international goal on Saturday to give the team a 2-1 Wembley win against Switzerland and the only question now seems to be when he will overhaul Wayne Rooney’s total of 53. Southgate suggested he was preparing to omit Kane from the starting lineup against Ivory Coast on Tuesday night and following that match England must play two of their four Nations League ties in June behind closed doors. The games against Hungary in Budapest and Italy at Wembley will have no fans present following sanctions from Uefa. Hungary have been punished for the behaviour of their supporters during Euro 2020 while England’s ban is because of disorder that marred the final against Italy. “I don’t think Harry will worry where he is playing in terms of the opportunity to break the record,” Southgate said. “But that would be hugely unfortunate [if it was to be in an empty stadium]. “Frankly we have seen and had enough of games behind closed doors but for both countries it is a punishment because our fans and their fans weren’t able to control themselves. That’s an embarrassment for us but it is the situation we have got. It would be particularly sad if that was the game where Harry broke the record.” Southgate said he had been “looking at two possible teams for these games” against Switzerland and Ivory Coast and he pushed back when asked if he faced a tough decision over whether to keep Kane in the starting XI on Tuesday. “No, that’s not a tough decision,” Southgate said. “We want to keep all of the squad involved. All of the players are also in a part of the season where they’re coming in off a heavy load of games and are going back into important games, so this is one of those occasions when it works for us and the clubs when it comes to sharing the load. “We need to find out about players and we still can bring players from the bench. We want to keep going on a positive run of results as well.”",Sport/Football,Southgate saddened at prospect of Kane making history in empty stadium,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/27/southgate-saddened-at-prospect-of-kane-making-history-in-empty-stadium
3/28/2022,"Even now, with Wilfried Zaha deep into an international career with Ivory Coast during which he has appeared at three Africa Cup of Nations finals, it is a question to tantalise. Was he the one that got away from England? It will surely run through a few minds on Tuesday night when the 29-year-old Crystal Palace winger lines up at Wembley for Ivory Coast against England – the country for whom he won two caps in friendlies. It will be a piece of history because no player has ever switched his allegiance from England and then returned to face them. Around the turn of the 20th century, there were two that transferred to England – Jack Reynolds from Ireland and Bobby Evans from Wales. Both had played matches against England and they would then win caps for them against Ireland and Wales, respectively. Five others have been capped by England and another country and only one of those is from the modern era – Declan Rice, who appeared in three friendlies for Ireland before going to England. Rice was an unused substitute for England against Ireland in 2020. Zaha, who was born in Abidjan and moved to south London as a four-year-old, made his decision to switch on 27 November 2016 because, frankly, he was sick of being overlooked by England. Capped at youth levels, Zaha was given his senior bow by Roy Hodgson against Sweden in November 2012. Playing in the Championship for Palace, Zaha was introduced in the 85th minute of a 4-2 defeat which was made famous by Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s fourth and final goal in stoppage-time – the outrageous 30-yard overhead kick. It was the following season that things became complicated. Zaha started the campaign at Manchester United and Hodgson would give him his second cap in August 2013; as a 75th-minute substitute in the 3-2 Wembley win against Scotland. Zaha had been a member of Stuart Pearce’s England Under-21 squad at the European Championship in June of that year; they bombed at the group stage. And, with opportunity scarce at United under David Moyes, Zaha would find himself back with the Under-21s for the remainder of the autumn programme. By then, Gareth Southgate was the manager of the youth side. But after Zaha was loaned by United to Cardiff in the winter transfer window for the remainder of the season and continued to struggle, Southgate felt that he could no longer get him into his team. It was the beginning of a lengthy spell in the international wilderness for Zaha and, when Southgate got the senior England manager’s job in September 2016 – initially on a caretaker basis – he would prolong it. Zaha’s camp have said the player had decided to declare for Ivory Coast before Southgate’s elevation while the manager has talked about the unsuccessful attempt he made to persuade him to change his mind. Could things have been different if Southgate had pushed hard to name him in his first squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovenia in October 2016? There would also be the flare-up the following March when Southgate said that if a player did not feel “that 100% passion of playing for England, then I’m not sure it’s for me to sell that to you”. Zaha’s agent responded furiously, saying his client’s desire or passion should never have been publicly questioned when he made his international decision. “I remember going to a hotel and meeting with Wilf,” Southgate says. “But at that point, he had made his mind up. I can understand it because he had been years without playing [for England]. My comments about players having to have the desire to play for England were tweaked a bit, I would say, so that created a bit of an atmosphere with Wilf and [the Palace chairman] Steve Parish for a while. That wasn’t an insinuation on Wilf. You couldn’t have a more passionate player.” When Southgate first took charge of England, the wide attacking players that he counted on were Raheem Sterling, Jesse Lingard, Adam Lallana, Theo Walcott, Marcus Rashford, Andros Townsend and Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain. His options have now evolved to an encouraging degree, taking in Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka, Jack Grealish and Emile Smith Rowe. But as even Southgate admits, Zaha is different to all of them. “Roy [Hodgson] had players who were ahead of Wilf for a long period and then we had my four games as caretaker where we were quite settled with experienced players and we didn’t want to bring too many new players in,” Southgate says. “It’s hard to say what Wilf’s role might have been with us. Raheem has been a key part of our team for a long period, Lingard had done a fabulous job and, at the start, we had Lallana, who was our player of the year for the first 18 months or so. “Would Wilf get into the squad now? I don’t know because he’s a good player playing at a high level every week. He’s a slightly different player to the ones we’ve got. No one had a crystal ball in terms of knowing how that would have worked out.”",Sport/Football,The one that got away?
