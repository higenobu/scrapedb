4/14/2022,"Baggage handlers have been so short-staffed that entire flights have departed without luggage as the Easter travel crush peaked at Australian airports, with unions warning the pandemic-depleted aviation industry is now structurally incapable of coping with pre-Covid-like levels of travel demand. While unloaded baggage and long queues affected travellers across the country on Thursday, unions have claimed that in Brisbane, so few service workers were available that female cleaners were sent in to clean male toilets while travellers were using them, and male cleaners into bathrooms with female patrons. The pressures of the holiday period, Covid isolation orders, and a workforce cut and outsourced during the pandemic has led to chaotic scenes at airports across the country, just as they record hundreds of thousands of travellers in what will be their busiest periods since before the pandemic. In Melbourne, Guardian Australia can reveal that baggage handlers working on Qantas flights but employed by international company Swissport – part of a controversial and legally contentious outsourcing decision – have been so short-staffed that some planes have been forced to leave without passengers’ luggage loaded on to the flight. At other instances in recent days, flights have left with half of the checked-in luggage, which allows the flights to depart with less delay. Irate passengers who appeared to be on flights affected by shortages of baggage handlers have been told they will receive their luggage in coming days. I know I am one among hundreds that had their bag lost by @qantas with no way to track or check on whether it's been found. It's just no amount of insurance will cover the 3 days worth of footage on the SD card that's in there. Sweating a little. 😖😓 An airport source – who did not want to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media – told Guardian Australia that on one occasion in recent days, just 87 of the 150 bags checked on a flight were loaded on to the plane. At times, just two baggage handlers have been available to unload a Boeing 737, and staff shortages within the companies that Qantas contracts to provide its baggage handlers are contributing to network-wide disruptions at several airports. The source said catering deliveries have also been plagued with issues, and planes have waited up to an hour on the tarmac for food deliveries and have also taken off on medium-haul flights with no food. “Workers are not being paid enough to work this much, and are leaving the baggage handling companies. This is not about Covid cases and workers isolating, this is about cost-cutting,” the source said. The source claimed that baggage handler staffing for Qantas flights had become so dire in recent days that employees, expecting to be overworked over Easter, “know they’re going to be absolutely whipped so they don’t show up at all”. “Since Qantas outsourced these jobs, it hasn’t been as visible an issue because flight demand hasn’t been the same as before Covid. But since last week, it’s been getting that busy again. These baggage handling companies are running with no fat, it’s about cutting costs,” the source said. I was on the same flight and all my stage costumes and everything for my show Cabaret de Paris - at QPAC that’s been rescheduled three times due to border closures and floods are somewhere ??? The guy there said it might take days to retrieve. I’m so upset https://t.co/dJTdIjmcqf Transport Workers’ Union national secretary, Michael Kaine, held a press conference with outsourced Qantas workers at Sydney airport on Thursday morning, and linked the decision to outsource 2,000 baggage handling roles with the “catastrophic scenes” at airports. “Those 2,000 workers are ready, willing and able to come back to work but Qantas is not putting them back on, and now we’re seeing this panicked response,” Kaine told ABC. A Qantas spokesperson told Guardian Australia: “We reject the union’s claims that these disruptions are linked to the decision 18 months ago to outsource our ground handling at airports.” She said between 20% and 50% of employees in some areas have been unable to work due to Covid-related staff shortages, and noted these issues are “happening across many areas of the aviation industry including in other airlines, in airport security screening and in other countries”. Sydney airport was set to record 82,000 travellers passing through its domestic terminals on Thursday – its busiest day since March 2020 – with a crippled security workforce offered $1,000 bonuses if they committed to working all their shifts over the 13-day Easter break roster. Air transport service staff – including security personnel at airports – are now recognised as critical workers in New South Wales and Victoria, which means they are exempt from the requirement to isolate for seven days if they are a close contact of a case, provided they are symptom-free. However the relaxation of the isolation rule has not eased all issues. At times, only a fraction of the security checkpoint lanes have been open. On Thursday morning, travellers heeding the call to allow extra time arrived at Sydney airport in the hours before its doors opened. Travellers reported queues forming outside some domestic departure halls before 4am – two hours before the airport’s curfew lifts. Melbourne airport is set to handle 76,000 passengers a day over the Easter period, while almost 60,000 passengers were believed to have passed through Brisbane airport on Thursday. At Brisbane airport, the United Workers Union said that so few cleaning staff were available that Securecorp, the company contracted by the airport, was asking female cleaners to clean male bathrooms without closing them to travellers. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning UWU property services coordinator, Damien Davie, said female members asked to clean male bathrooms in the past had reported assault, and said “nobody should be abused, or made to feel unsafe at work, ever”. “If Securecorp are unable to roster on enough workers to undertake their work safely, then the toilets should be closed. If Brisbane airport doesn’t like the toilets being closed, well, they need to take that up with the contractor, not force people to put their safety at risk,” he said. “As air travel returns to where it once was and workers are forced to work around increased passengers, it is only a matter of time before the abuse and the inappropriate comments become something much worse,” Davie said. Guardian Australia contacted Brisbane airport, but a spokesperson referred questions to the cleaning contractor, Securecorp.",News/Australia news,Short-staffed Australian airports in chaos as flights depart without any luggage,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/14/short-staffed-australian-airports-in-chaos-as-flights-depart-without-any-luggage
4/14/2022,"South Africa is bracing for more heavy rain in districts hit by massive and lethal downpours earlier this week. More than 300 people have been killed by flooding in and around the eastern coastal city of Durban in recent days. On Wednesday the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, described the flooding as a “catastrophe of enormous proportions”, directly linking it to the climate emergency. “It is telling us that climate change is serious, it is here,” Ramaphosa said as he visited flooded areas of Durban and the surrounding eThekwini metropolitan area. “We no longer can postpone what we need to do, and the measures we need to take to deal with climate change,” Ramaphosa said. The South African weather service has warned of continued high wind and rain bringing the risk of continued flooding in KwaZulu-Natal and some other provinces over the Easter weekend. Meteorologists said the flooding had taken them by surprise. Some parts of KwaZulu-Natal recorded almost their average annual rainfall in 48 hours. “Whilst impact-based warnings were indeed issued in a timely manner ... it appears that the exceptionally heavy rainfall …. exceeded even the expectations of the southern African meteorological community at large,” a statement from the weather service said. The service said although it was impossible to attribute an individual event to the climate crisis, “we can state with confidence that globally (as a direct result of global warming and associated climate change) all forms of severe and extreme weather … are becoming more frequent and more extreme than in the recent past. “In other words, heavy rain events such as the current incident can … be expected to recur in the future and with increasing frequency.” The death toll is expected to continue rising as search and rescue operations continue in KwaZulu-Natal, officials said. “KwaZulu-Natal is going to be declared a provincial area of disaster, so that we are able to do things quickly. The bridges have collapsed, the roads have collapsed, people have died and people are injured,” said Ramaphosa. Along with the loss of life, damage to infrastructure was extensive. Durban’s port, the busiest in southern Africa, was badly hit. In one township a Methodist church was swept away. A Hindu temple was badly damaged in Umhlatuzana, Chatsworth, after a river burst its banks. Elsewhere, flooding triggered massive landslides. Many survivors appeared traumatised. Nokuthula Ntantiso’s house survived, but many others in her Umlazi township did not. “It’s scary, because even last night I didn’t sleep ... because I was wondering if even this [home] that I’m sleeping in can collapse at any time,” the 31-year-old call centre operator said. Authorities were also seeking to restore electricity to large parts of the province after heavy flooding at various power stations. Major NGOs were working to distribute clean water. A dozen crocodiles that went missing from breeding ponds after the heavy rains swamped a crocodile farm near Durban were reportedly recaptured. Rescue efforts by the South African National Defense Force were delayed as the military’s air wing was affected by the floods, Gen Rudzani Maphwanya said. The military was able to deploy personnel and helicopters around the province on Wednesday, he said. Rain continued in parts of Durban on Wednesday afternoon and a flood warning was issued for the neighbouring province of Eastern Cape. Durban has struggled to recover from deadly riots last July that killed more than 350 people, South Africa’s worst unrest since the end of apartheid.",News/World news,South Africa braces for more heavy rain after floods kill hundreds,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/south-africa-braces-more-heavy-rain-floods-kill-hundreds-durban
4/14/2022,"Amy Schumer received death threats of sufficient plausibility that the authorities contacted her in the wake of a joke she made at the Oscars, the actor has revealed. Speaking on the Howard Stern Show, Schumer discussed the segment of the 27 March ceremony in which she pretended to mistake the actor Kirsten Dunst, Oscar-nominated for her role in The Power of the Dog, for a seat-filler – someone who sits in a guest’s chair while they leave briefly to visit the bathroom, to give the impression of a full room. Schumer was swift to explain to fans upset at the perceived slight that both Dunst and her partner, Jesse Plemons, were in on the joke. “Hey I appreciate the love for Kirsten Dunst,” she said. “I love her, too! Wouldn’t disrespect that queen like that.” Schumer told Stern that this explanation was necessary after abuse and threats she received in relation to the joke went out of control. “They were so bad the secret service reached out to me,” said Schumer. “I was like, ‘I think you have the wrong number. It’s Amy, not Will [Smith].’ The misogyny is unbelievable.” The Los Angeles police department also contacted Schumer concerning the joke. Schumer told Stern that she was sure to brief all targets of her jokes in advance, including Leonardo DiCaprio, whose habit of dating much younger women was ridiculed. Schumer said DiCaprio replied, “Go ahead.” Speaking to Stern, Schumer also sought to clarify a joke she said had been mooted for inclusion during the ceremony but which was scrapped on taste grounds. “Don’t Look Up is the name of a movie?” the joke ran. “More like don’t look down the barrel of Alec Baldwin’s shotgun.” Public reaction to the joke, relating to Baldwin’s involvement with a fatal shooting on the set of western Rust, was scathing; Schumer said on 13 April she actually never intended to use it but instead wanted to demonstrate the kind of “evil horrible roast jokes that I can’t help [are] in my mind”. Schumer also discussed the chief talking point of the ceremony: best actor winner Will Smith slapping the presenter Chris Rock for a joke about his wife’s alopecia. In the aftermath of the incident, Schumer declared herself “triggered and traumatised” by the incident. “People made fun of me for saying it was traumatising,” Schumer told Stern. “I don’t think it was traumatising for me. I think it was traumatising for all of us.” Smith has since been banned from all Oscars events for 10 years as a result of his actions.",Arts/Culture,Amy Schumer: I received death threats after Oscars seat-filler joke,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/14/amy-schumer-i-received-death-threats-oscars-seat-filler-joke-kirsten-dunst
4/14/2022,"Lewis Hamilton’s glinted piercings and gleaming earrings are as much a part of his look as his afro-natural hairstyles and sharp tailoring. The 37-year-old’s habit of wearing jewellery in competition has never been an issue in his 15 previous F1 seasons, seven of them ending in world championships. But at last week’s Australian Grand Prix, rookie race director Niels Wittich made clear that he would be enforcing a longstanding regulation banning drivers from wearing any material under their livery that isn’t fireproof. In his Melbourne pre-race notes Wittich expressly prohibited “the wearing of jewellery in the form of body piercings or metal neck chains” while allowing drivers a few races’ grace period to comply. After that, they risked a fine or reprimand. While technically indexed as Appendix L in the FIA’s international sporting code, odds are this statute will be remembered by a different name: the Hamilton rule. Flashing his trademark earrings and nose stud for the pre-race news conference, Hamilton, F1’s only Black driver, hit back. “I don’t plan on removing [them], he said of his piercings, some of which, he suggested, are not so obvious and semi-permanent. “I feel like there are personal things. You should be able to be who you are.” After finishing fourth, he was even more emphatic. “They’ll be staying,” he said. Few sportsmen make fashion statements quite like Hamilton. The record-breaking driver not only turned up to last fall’s Met gala in a Kenneth Nicholson-tailored suit (matched to a lace white button-down with a train that extended to his left foot), he also paid more than $275,000 for one of the event’s exclusive tables – which are typically bought up by the leading fashion houses – to make sure Nicholson and other emerging Black designers were in attendance at fashion’s biggest event. So as much as Wittich’s interest in prosecuting Appendix L might appear sincere in a sport where fires really do break out when accidents happen, it’s hard not to see this initiative as yet another instance of sports organisations policing Black bodies. On that score, no sports league has been quite as zealous as the NBA – which, in the past four decades alone, has banned jewellery, du-rags, personalised Band-Aids, and headbands while becoming the first major professional sports league to impose a dress code for players when they’re arriving at and leaving matches or sitting on the bench. That last measure was intended to curb hip-hop culture’s encroachment on the game; what it actually did was turn NBA players into clothes horses and transform their path from the arena car park to the locker room into a catwalk. The ultra-conservative NFL has no prohibitions on jewellery, but the league does restrict “hard objects”. Still, that didn’t stop the LA Rams’ Odell Beckham – another Met gala perennial – from courting controversy for wearing a $190,000 Richard Mille timepiece during a 2019 game. Nor did it spare the Oakland Raiders’ Michael Crabtree from embarrassment when Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib snatched a gold chain off the wide receiver’s neck during a terse exchange. Major League Baseball is OK with jewellery on the field too, as long as it doesn’t interrupt the flow of the game. But that air of permissiveness probably has less to do with any enlightened thinking inside the commissioner’s office than a bellicose players’ union that skews overwhelmingly white. Since the glare from Seattle Mariners reliever Arthur Rhodes’ earrings threw off the Cleveland Indians hitter Omar Vizquel and resulted in a bench-clearing brawl more than a decade ago, jewellery hasn’t really come into play much on the baseball diamond. And when accidents do happen, and a player is left fumbling around the infield on all fours to recover bits of a broken chain, well, non-baseball purists tend to laugh it off. In high school track and field, however, jewellery bans have been a point of contention – even though one would be hard pressed to imagine Usain Bolt, Athing Mu or Michael Johnson without conjuring images of their gold chains flapping in the breeze. After decades of incidents of high school competitors being disqualified for everything from bling chains to those yellow rubber Livestrong bracelets, the National Federation of State High School Associations abandoned its jewellery ban in 2014. Evidently, the final straw dropped when a high school sprinter in Eugene, Oregon, named Spencer Schmidt was initially disqualified from a state meet for wearing a frayed Nike wristband to treat patellar tendinitis. (Schmidt, who went on to win state after his DQ was overturned, wound up running for the Oregon Ducks.) The consternation around jewellery in sports seems an offshoot of the historical polarisation of Black hair, which has been tied to stereotypes and biases that have restricted Black people’s social mobility. And while Congress’s recent passing of the Crown Act is an attempt to address some of the problem, Hamilton, through his defiance, shows just how out of touch institutions still are.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Sport has always had an uncomfortable stance on jewellery – especially when worn by Black athletes,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/14/sport-jewellery-black-athletes
4/14/2022,"As a child, in the back of the car on drives along the motorway, I would look for connections between the number plates on surrounding cars. How many started with an odd number? How many with an even number? The search for patterns is a common human trait. People also see images in TV static, or nonexistent patterns in the goals scored in football games. There is a term for this: illusory pattern perception, the human tendency to try to make sense of the world by finding relationships between stimuli. It has been found to be a “central cognitive mechanism” accounting for conspiracy theories and supernatural beliefs. I see this in the inclination to stitch together disparate cultural events (see, here I am, looking for meaning) that has become widespread on social media. The tendency to think that everything can be linked to something else, or compared, or both, and hence explained. The recent Oscars slap by the actor Will Smith was compared, nonsensically, to both Harvey Weinstein’s sustained history of sexual abuse and harassment, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This was just one recent example of something that happens all the time. There are the associations drawn between politicians and the types of boyfriends common to stock internet jokes. The wildly inappropriate and crass comparisons between geopolitical disasters such as the US invasion of Afghanistan and interpersonal conflict such as familial abuse. Or even between Afghanistan and the generational fall in living standards experienced by some western millennials (a rise in student debt or rent is of course bad, but not even vaguely comparable to living in a conflict zone). Recently, I’ve noticed a trend whereby Americans refer to themselves as residents of a “failed state”. Words such as violence and harm are used to mean slightly different things, and then slightly different things again, and again and again, until those words don’t really mean anything at all. This thing is basically that thing, which is just like another thing, which is practically something else. On and on and on it goes, in a never-ending chain of nonsense, each iteration stripping back a layer of seriousness until none remains. It is chaos born out of an attempt to make sense of the enormous flux of disparate information on social media. The endless stream of celebrity gossip, wars, professional announcements, kidnappings, birthdays, statistics about rent and gas and the rising cost of a pint and the cinema, political corruption, good news about friends, good news about enemies, sexual violence. Everything. Too much. And all of it is flattened. Everything depicted on social media is presented in the same small number of available formats: scraps of text, photos, links (for further information or to convey authority?), short video clips and cartoons. Everything is reduced to little squares of information, like car number plates on a motorway. There is no real distinction made, in terms of the presentation of information, between the gravity of disparate events or the severity of situations. The gulf between serious and silly is collapsed. Concepts like “trigger warnings” emerge and quickly become so widespread and misused that they aren’t meaningful. I recently saw suggestions that they should be applied to April Fools’ Day pranks. Nothing is in proportion. Even death is strangely meaningless. One illustration of this is how normal it has become for people to send strangers on social media messages telling them to kill themselves (the last time I received such a message, for example, was a few weeks ago). We can talk about the clear internet poisoning at work here, or we can say this behaviour is unhinged. That doesn’t detract from how strange it is. And how strange it is that I doubt anyone who sends a message like this even means it. Because killing yourself is just like violence, which is practically Harvey Weinstein, which is basically a slap at the Oscars, which is more or less a Russian tank, which is, for all intents and purposes, a toxic ex-boyfriend. I don’t know what we gain from treating cultural events and life experiences as interchangeable units of information which can be easily linked, like nodes in a huge, all-encompassing web. But I think we lose our sense of life as it really is. When we see the meaning of an event in terms of its relationships to something different, it is the relationship we consider rather than the event itself. And I wonder if this is the point. If this is a way to insulate ourselves from the true weight of certain facets of reality. A way of addressing wars and suicides and sexual assaults and so many other brutalities without really considering them; of touching everything without feeling it. Because, who really wants to take it all in? When I think of the cars on the motorway, it was very rare that I could connect the numbers. Mostly it worked if I cheated a bit. I could count two odd starting numbers in a row and if the next was an even, I could look to the second in the row for an odd, maybe count two more like that. Or start again, looking for prime numbers this time. And then three plates later, a new rule. But it was a good distraction. I could do it for hours.

4/14/2022,"Sofia Shafaq, a 33-year-old accountant from Leeds, says she had been in labour for three days in July 2021, when she called her midwife and begged for a caesarean section. She had already been to the hospital three times, and, each time she had been sent home. She says the labour hadn’t progressed and she was only 2cm dilated. “It felt like I was going to die. Like someone had put a knife in me and was twisting it.” The midwife made her feel silly for asking for a casearean section. “She said: ‘That’s not something we offer.’” Shafaq says that, when she was finally allowed into the labour ward, she hadn’t slept or eaten and was too exhausted to push the baby out. Staff had to use forceps and she tore, and had to have an episiotomy. Now, she has a prolapse, which she believes is due to the forceps. “I am angry,” she says. “There’s a lot of trauma there. I’m always in tears.” She believes that all of this would have been avoidable if staff at the hospital had listened. “I am suffering today, because I did not get what I wanted,” she says. Last week, senior midwife Donna Ockenden issued her long-awaited review on the Shrewsbury maternity scandal. She found that nine mothers and 201 babies might have survived had staff provided better care. Mothers were denied caesarean sections and forced to suffer traumatic births because of an obsession with hitting “normal” birth targets, meaning that the trust had one of the lowest C-section rates in the country. In some instances, families were blamed when their babies died. Shrewsbury follows other, much publicised maternity scandals: Morecambe Bay, where one mother and 11 babies died, east Kent, where the hospital trust recently pleaded guilty to criminal charges, and Nottingham, where 46 babies were left with brain damage. Across these cases, common themes recur: mothers not being listened to when expressing concerns about how their labour was progressing; staff fixated with vaginal birth at all costs, even when C-sections were medically necessary; and understaffed hospital units failing to monitor women appropriately. After the review, women are speaking out about their experiences of giving birth – and, worryingly, it appears that some of the attitudes that underpinned the Shrewsbury scandal are commonplace. “It goes so much wider than this report,” says Maria Booker of the charity Birthrights. “Women are not being listened to. And staff are not listening to each other.” In 2020, Birthrights and the parenting website Mumsnet ran a survey of 1,145 mothers. One in four said that their wishes about how they gave birth were not respected. This is despite the fact that, in 2015, the UK supreme court issued a ruling that deemed that women should be given information about their pregnancies and trusted to make decisions about their care. The Montgomery ruling was a response to a case brought in Lanarkshire by Nadine Montgomery, who was small and had type 1 diabetes, a condition that can lead to giving birth to larger than average babies, putting them at risk of shoulder dystocia – where the baby gets stuck during birth. But Montgomery was not informed by her doctor, Dina McLellan, about this risk. McLellan admitted that, if she had been informed, Montgomery would probably have asked for a C-section. As a result of Montgomery’s son getting stuck during his birth, he was deprived of oxygen and later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The supreme court was scathing about McLellan’s apparent attitude to C-sections. “Whatever Dr McLellan may have had in mind,” ruled the judges, “this does not look like a purely medical judgment. It looks like a judgment that vaginal delivery is in some way morally preferable to a caesarean section.” The guidelines in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), published in 2011 and updated in 2021, enshrine a pregnant woman’s right to choose how she gives birth, stating that women should be able to request caesarean sections without a medical reason, after carefully considering the facts. And yet pregnant women are still not treated as rational actors by many clinicians. “There was this general attitude,” says Isobel Bradshaw, a 38-year-old communications worker from Hampshire, “of ‘we don’t talk about caesarean sections’. It was the bogeyman. If you talked about it, it would happen.” Bradshaw is 5ft 1in and, in the final trimester of her pregnancy, her baby had a growth spurt, which was in the 90th percentile for her size. During a visit for a hospital scan, Bradshaw says she asked her doctor whether a caesarean section was necessary. “She was dismissive,” says Bradshaw. “It felt like: ‘Oh, we’ll just give it a go, and see what happens. It will probably be OK.’” When Bradshaw gave birth in June 2017, doctors had to perform an emergency C-section. “I was 80% sure it was going to happen,” says Bradshaw. “Just from the size of me, and the size of the bump. So I was mentally prepared for it.” But she could easily not have been: Bradshaw says she knows of women who have been traumatised by the experience. She wishes her C-section had been planned, so she wouldn’t have had to spend the final weeks of her pregnancy worrying. If she has another child, she says: “You can be damn sure I will have a C-section. I don’t want to go through this again.” Booker says that one of the most common reasons women contact Birthrights’ advice line is denial of a C-section request. Other reasons include not being allowed to give birth in a midwife-led birth centre, or to have a home birth. In 2018, Birthrights published a report showing that some NHS trusts had made it incredibly difficult to go ahead with maternal request caesareans. “When women have their wishes ignored,” says Booker, “it traumatises them.” Studies have shown such women are more likely to develop PTSD. Last year, the Commons health and social care committee found that “there is still clinician-led pressure for women to choose vaginal delivery, even when this may not be in their best interests”. This is despite the fact that the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) abandoned its normal birth campaign, which encouraged mothers to give birth without interventions, in 2017. “Can I give you 100% reassurance that every woman feels listened to? I cannot,” says Dr Jo Mountfield, the vice-president for workforce and professionalism at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. “People do their best. But there is a lot of pressure in the system at the moment. To listen, you need to have time.” In November 2021, the RCM warned of a maternity staffing crisis. More than 57% of midwives surveyed planned to quit, citing concerns about staffing levels and fears over patient safety. “I receive messages on a daily basis from midwives,” says Leah Hazard, midwife and author of Hard Pushed: A Midwife’s Story, “who tell me they’re coming on shift and realising there aren’t enough staff to keep the workload safe.” Hazard is scathing about the £127m funding boost for NHS England maternity services, given that last year the health and social care committee determined that an annual increase of around £350m was required. “It’s insulting,” she says. Covid has put additional strain on already stretched services. “It felt like they were so stressed,” says Marissa, a 43-year-old teacher from east London. “They just wanted to get you in and out.” Marissa became pregnant in December 2020 after eight years of trying and two previous miscarriages. Because a lockdown was in place, some midwifery appointments were by phone; at in-person appointments, she says staff appeared harried. “There was no sense of support or concern or care,” says Marissa. “They seemed irritated and rushed.” During one appointment, Marissa says, her midwife was ordering items from Amazon on her phone. At another, Marissa asked how she should spot reduced foetal movements, but says her midwife’s response didn’t make sense. “She said: ‘Does your baby have a pattern of movement?’ I said: ‘Not really.’ She said: ‘Well, if the pattern changes, go in.’” Marissa’s son died at 39 weeks in August 2021, after a placental abruption. She claims that hospital staff initially put her in a regular maternity ward as she waited to deliver her stillborn child. “It was horrific,” she says. “All night long I heard babies being born.” Just after giving her the news, she says that a doctor asked her whether she had had reduced movements. “It felt like he was blaming me,” she says. “His tone was accusatory. It wasn’t compassionate.” (Doctors later told Marissa that her unborn son would have died quickly in the womb, and she likely would not have noticed the reduced movements until it was too late.) It is not only male clinicians who are to blame. “The misogyny is entrenched in the women’s behaviour as well,” says Marissa. This is ironic, since midwifery is a female-dominated profession, and also given the natural birth movement’s historical connection to second-wave feminism. The movement was “an understandable response to patriarchal control over birth”, says Eliane Glaser, author of Motherhood: A Manifesto. In the first half of the 20th century, male doctors took childbirth out of homes and into hospitals. Women were often sedated and forced to endure traumatic and unnecessary interventions. Throughout the 60s and 70s, natural birth advocates evangelised about the empowering qualities of intervention-free childbirth, even if it was painful. “The pain of normal labour does have meaning,” writes 70s activist and US midwife Ina May Gaskin in Ina May’s Guide to Childbirth. In the UK, the movement was spearheaded by the controversial 1930s obstetrician Grantly Dick-Read, who argued that “healthy childbirth was never intended by the natural law to be painful”. Rather, he suggested that educated women experience pain as a result of fear, and they should look to their “primitive” sisters in the developing world, who are unburdened by this anxiety. “This attitude was racist to non-white women,” says Glaser. “And it’s also an anti-feminist attack on educated women.” Dick-Read’s philosophy inspired Prunella Briance to found The Natural Childbirth Association in 1956, which became the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) in 1961. “I think the NCT is essentially a benign institution now,” says Glaser. But a recent investigation by the i newspaper found that the NCT had deleted information telling women that natural births will leave mothers “more satisfied”, four days before the publication of the Ockenden review. While the NCT’s leadership insists it does not favour one method of birth over another, this message does not appear to have trickled out to some trainers. “She actually said the words ‘too posh to push’,” says Emily, a 34-year-old film-maker from north London, of her NCT trainer. Emily is pregnant and has opted for an elective caesarean section. She claims the trainer recently split the class into groups and made them role play a vaginal and C-section birth. “She made the vaginal birth seem easy,” says Emily. “There was no discussion about forceps or tearing or stitches.” Then it was time to role play a caesarean section. “She said: ‘I need an anaesthetist, surgeon, surgeon’s assistant, birth partner, paediatrician, midwife and medical student in the room.’” According to Emily, the trainer asked, pointedly, how it felt to have so many people “crowded around”. Emily is considering lodging a formal complaint with the NCT. An NCT spokesperson said: “We are not here to promote one way over another, but to ensure parents have access to evidence-based information and a network of peer and specialist support. It saddens us greatly if we hear that someone hasn’t had the positive experience of our services that we expect … Our antenatal course content is guided by a framework, which has evolved over the years in response to evidence and guidelines and the views of parents. The framework expects courses to cover all ways of giving birth, reflecting the various options and outcomes that individuals may experience.” The ideology Emily feels she experienced remains prevalent, and is often subtly reinforced through language. “The whole framing of interventions is negative,” says Glaser. “If you have a drug-free birth, it’s: ‘Congratulations! You did so well.’ And if you have a C-section, you’re a coward.” As a result of this narrative, women who require interventions can feel they have failed, even though they account for nearly 40% of births. “Women tell me: ‘I wanted a vaginal birth. Everyone told me I should have a natural birth. I have failed. What kind of mum will I be, if I can’t even give birth to my baby?’” says Dr Anushka Aubeelack, an obstetric anaesthetist at a London hospital trust. “Where are they getting this from? You are literally putting your life on the line for your baby. How is having a torn-up undercarriage greater proof of motherhood?” Aubeelack says this anti-intervention messaging comes “from family and friends, and antenatal classes”. This was an attitude reflected by clinicians providing evidence to the health and social care committee, who judged that “the pressures of the wider community, social media, and antenatal classes … [contributed] to a big expectation of normality among expectant parents.” This message can prove actively harmful. “It leads to a sense of distrust between the mother and the medical team,” says Aubeelack. “I have seen women put off life-saving decisions because of this wariness.”An NCT spokesperson said: “Timely intervention is a vital component of safe care; women should not be made to feel guilty about any of their choices, and instead need kind, respectful support to make the decisions that are right for them and their baby.” At the other end of the scale, women who do request interventions may find their requests fall on deaf ears. “There is so much evidence to show that women are denied C-sections and pain relief when they ask for it,” says Glaser. “These denials can go from flat refusals to subtle refusals, where staff say: ‘Let’s see how you get along.’” Shafaq says she was refused pain relief by a midwife in the early stages of labour. “She looked at me like I was pretending to be in pain,” Shafaq says. Hazard questions whether some staff suffer compassion fatigue, although she stresses this does not excuse their behaviour. “When you’re under chronic stress, it can be a common emotional response,” she says. Racism may also play a factor: studies have shown that Asian and Black women are more likely to have their requests ignored on maternity units. Black women are four times more likely than white women to die during pregnancy and childbirth. Bradshaw, who is mixed heritage, was aware of this when pregnant with her daughter, and it is part of the reason she says she tried to argue for a caesarean section, although she claims these requests were ignored by her doctor. “I didn’t want to be one of those statistics,” she says. But the picture is not all bad. The UK has one of the lowest maternal death rates in the world and if there is one positive to emerge from the harrowing revelations of the Ockenden review, it is that they have prompted a wider reckoning across NHS maternity services, which may translate into better practice. “I hope this is a moment of reflection for us as a profession to consider whether we are really listening to women,” says Hazard. Because, ultimately, the only good birth is the one in which mother and baby come out alive and well. * Some names have been changed ",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘I was told they didn’t offer C-sections’ – the dangerous obsession with ‘natural births’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/14/i-was-told-they-didnt-offer-c-sections-the-dangerous-obsession-with-natural-births
4/14/2022,"It was love at first sight when five-year-old Carlo Amodeo first saw a swarm of black bees. He could not stop thinking about them and every night for a week he had the same dream: of building a house for the bees made from wood using his toy carpentry set. Amodeo, now 62, still remembers that first encounter. It took place in the 1960s, while he was spending the summer with his mother at the seaside 30 minutes from Palermo, in north-west Sicily. He saw the swarm hanging from an olive trunk during a stroll in the countryside. “I was paralysed, motionless like a dog pointing at prey,” he recalls. “Then my mother dragged me off to the beach.” Today, Amodeo has been a beekeeper for more than 40 years. And though he never built that bee house, he has been instrumental in helping the recovery of the Sicilian black bee (Apis mellifera siciliana), along with Palermo University and researchers. The global threats to bee survival are well-known: pesticides, the climate crisis, monoculture and diseases. But it was hybridisation that brought Sicilian black bees close to extinction in the 1970s. “Moving bee subspecies to different territories has strong consequences: hybridisation erodes natural diversity and weakens them,” says Cecilia Costa, a honeybee expert and researcher at Italy’s Council for Agricultural Research and Economics (Crea). “Each honeybee population has a positive adaptation to its native environment that gives it better survival capacity and more favourable apicultural characteristics.” In Sicily, when commercial beekeeping intensified in the 1970s, the Italian peninsula bee (Apis mellifera ligustica) was massively imported from northern Italy. “At that time, most of the Sicilian beekeepers were still practising traditional apiculture with beehives built from the stalks of the giant fennel plant [Ferula thyrsifolia], unable to respond to the growing market demand,” says Costa. Crossbreeding with local Sicilian black bees started. Raffaella Ponzio of the Slow Food Foundation for Biodiversity says: “Often, local subspecies worldwide get lost in favour of more productive breeding, as happened in Sicily. But their conservation is essential to maintain the ecosystem balance.” The organisation, supported by the University of Palermo, created a committee to safeguard Sicilian black bees with eight professional beekeepers, including Amodeo. Currently, there are more than 250 beekeepers taking care of Sicilian black bees along the western part of the island, as far away as possible from crops sprayed with pesticides. But it was a long journey to reach this point. In 1985, Amodeo was an agricultural sciences student at the University of Palermo, where he met entomology professor Pietro Genduso, who had been searching for Sicilian black bees on the island for years. They joined forces and were eventually rewarded in 1987 when a landlord in Carini, a town 20km (13 miles) from Palermo, invited Amodeo to check an abandoned apiary in his courtyard close to a lemon grove. There, he found three genetic families of Sicilian black bees. “Genduso had this idea: bring them to a solitary environment to avoid hybridisation and enable them to reproduce,” says Amodeo. “I used the ferry and my rubber boat to carry the black bees to the nearest Aeolian island, travelling when the sea was calm to avoid bee stress.” In the early 2000s, Amodeo became the first and only official Sicilian black beekeeper on the National Register of Italian Honey Bee Breeders. Every 10 days, Amodeo checks his black bees in an apiary surrounded by prickly pear, olives, loquat trees and a carpet of yellow sorrel flowers. It is just a few miles from the spot where he saw black bees for the first time. Despite the typical yellow striped image, these bees have a black abdomen and tiny wings that enable them to fly into strong winds. Amodeo does not use gloves or face protection to open the beehive for a routine check. Beekeepers like him say that Sicilian black bees are docile and calm and, compared with imported ones, more resistant to diseases, the varroa mite and extreme heat, which is increasing in Sicily. Amodeo has never lost his fascination with these bees and continues to dedicate his efforts to ensure their survival. “The black bees give me so much,” he says. “I dream of seeing bees flying around without the risk of being poisoned. This would give back a bit of what they give to us and a better life for future generations.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment, ‘I dream of bees’: one boy’s encounter with a swarm in Sicily led to a lifetime’s devotion,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/14/sicilian-black-bees-one-boys-encounter-swarm-sicily-lifetime-devotion-aoe

I loved the mystery and disquieting feel that only grew in each episode. It’s been adapted for TV, too [by Amazon] with Julia Roberts and Janelle Monáe, and is so bingeable in either format. This week, Stuart Heritage picks five of the best comedy talkshows, from a show that zooms in on comics’ best jokes to Conan O’Brien’s magnum opus Off MenuIn which comedians Ed Gamble and James Acaster essentially do Desert Island Discs, but with food. On paper the premise has the potential to be grindingly repetitious – because, honestly, nobody cares about your preferred method of potato preparation – but what really makes the podcast sing is the spectrum of its bookings. As you’d expect, plenty of British comedians pass through the gate, but their numbers are occasionally peppered with more unexpected names from the world of showbiz (see: Gok Wan and, er, Ross Kemp) and members of the comedy elite that the hosts desperately want to impress (David Cross, Michael McKean). The fact that Gamble and Acaster can deal with both is hugely impressive.Hollywood HandbookThere are two stages to listening to Hollywood Handbook. The first is utter hopelessness, as hosts Sean Clement and Hayes Davenport (two comedy writers with very similar voices) throw out a barrage of context-free references to life in Tinseltown. Soon, though, something will click and you’ll have a new favourite podcast. Part of the joy is hearing a guest audibly struggle to adapt their shtick to the insular tone of the hosts. If they can (like Tom Scharpling, the unofficial third host), it is wonderful. If they can’t (like Pauly Shore) it is astonishing. Good OneAlthough in itself very funny, Good One – hosted by Vulture’s Jesse David Fox – also has the distinction of actually being about comedy. The premise of the podcast is that Fox and his comedian guests drill down into one specific joke of theirs. The calibre of comics featured is impossibly high (Martin Short, Seth Rogen, Jenny Slate, Jamie Demetriou) and, by filtering the conversation through the specific choices that informed their work, the interviews are impressively intimate. Also, points should be awarded to Fox for always sounding like the guest’s most knowledgable fan. Conan O’Brien Needs a FriendThree decades presenting a nightly late night show, and it turns out that Conan O’Brien’s perfect vehicle was podcasts all along. Each episode’s longform interview gives O’Brien much more to work with than the two-anecdotes-and-a-clip format of American talkshows (and lets him talk to people he genuinely admires, like biographer Robert Caro) while the segments that bookend the interviews allow him to indulge his more gleefully dickish nature. These moments, which regularly spiral out into him railing against his assistant and producer, are some of the purest comedy that he has ever put his name to. Cuddle ClubOstensibly, this is comedian Lou Sanders’ podcast about cuddles, although in reality it’s a rambling, sometimes seemingly formless discussion between her and a different celebrity, bolstered by Sanders’ ability to be nosy almost to the point of pathology. Quite often, especially with a guest as thoughtful and reserved as Alex Horne, her line of questioning drifts away from ‘traditional interviewer’ and more towards ‘socially oblivious nan interrogating her granddaughter’s terrified new boyfriend over dinner’. Obviously this is meant as a profound compliment.

4/14/2022,"Politicians have described Priti Patel’s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda as “evil” and “inhumane”, amid fierce criticism from refugee charities, which have said the move is ill-conceived. The government is on Thursday expected to announce multimillion-pound plans for asylum seekers who cross the Channel in small boats to be flown for processing to Rwanda. Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s just chilling, absolutely chilling, to think that people who are coming here for a whole host of reasons – vulnerable people – are going to be taken all the way to Africa to be processed. “This is not the mark of a civilised society. It’s evil. It just turns my stomach to see that our government acting in our name can behave in such a way, and I think a lot of people are going to be quite aghast.” Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative MP for Sutton Coldfield and a former chief whip, said the new approach was “globally unprecedented” and raised questions around how it would work and how the government would safeguard human rights. He added: “MPs from across the house have already expressed concerns about adopting a policy which Australia abandoned as a failure.” The first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, tweeted that the plans were “cruel and inhumane” and “a cynical distraction from the prime minister’s law-breaking”. Defending the plan on Sky News, the Wales secretary, Simon Hart, said the estimated cost was “about £120m” and followed nine months of negotiation with the Rwandan government. He said it would deter criminal gangs and reduce exploitation by making it no longer viable to smuggle vulnerable people into the UK. On LBC, he said: “What we are proposing with the government of Rwanda is to improve the chances to break up the criminal gangs, to reduce the horrible level of exploitation and to improve the chances for people who have crossed half the world at huge emotional and personal and financial expense. “At the moment, they are being put in dreadful danger by these ruthless people, and so I think what we are doing is really consistent with our reputation. We pride ourselves on this ‘nation of sanctuary’ label and I hope that this, when it’s up and running, will be able to reinforce that reputation.” However, refugee and human rights charities have vehemently criticised the plans, warning they were unlikely to address the exploitation of vulnerable people. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the government had violated the principle of the UN convention, of which the UK was a founding signatory, to “grant people a fair hearing on UK soil”.Speaking on the Today programme, he said: “I think it’s rather extraordinary the government is obsessing with control instead of focusing on competence and compassion.”He added the plan was unlikely to discourage people from undertaking dangerous journeys to flee persecution, and recommended instead that dialogue be opened with other European countries about how to encourage safe routes to asylum, including by allowing people to apply for visas in embassies around the world. The chief executive of Refugee Action, Tim Naor Hilton, accused the government of “offshoring its responsibilities on to Europe’s former colonies instead of doing our fair share to help some of the most vulnerable people on the planet”.He added that the UK should have learned from “Australia’s horrific experiment” of sending refugees to camps overseas where they experienced “rampant abuse” as well as “rape, murder and suicide”.“This grubby cash-for-people plan would be a cowardly, barbaric and inhumane way to treat people fleeing persecution and war,” Naor Hilton said. Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee and migrant rights director, noted that Rwanda had a “dismal human rights record”.In a statement to the PA Media news agency, Valdez-Symonds said: “This shockingly ill-conceived idea will go far further in inflicting suffering while wasting huge amounts of public money.”",News/UK news,UK plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda sparks fierce criticism,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/uk-plan-to-send-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda-sparks-fierce-criticism
4/14/2022,"P&O Ferries has suspended all passenger services on the Dover-Calais route over the Easter bank holiday weekend, causing further disruptions for UK travellers. Two of the beleaguered ferry firm’s eight vessels – the Pride of Kent and Spirit of Britain – are still being detained by Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) over safety concerns, resulting in ferry shortages on a key route in the run-up the busy travel period. The company confirmed in a tweet that it was cancelling all Channel crossings over the Easter weekend. #PODover #POCalais for travel between 15/04 00:01 - 18/04 23:59, we will provide a full refund of your ticket.

Claims should be sent to help@poferries.com 2/2 It adds to wider travel chaos in the UK, where staff shortfalls have led to flight cancellations and long waits at airports. Meanwhile, rail passengers have been warned of delays by Network Rail, which is carrying out 530 engineering upgrades on routes including on the west coast mainline from London Euston to Milton Keynes. The AA estimates 27.6m car journeys could take place over the weekend. Motorists are advised to travel on Thursday or early on Saturday if they can, to give themselves the best chance of avoiding long queues. Edmund King, the AA president, said: “All our polling suggests Good Friday will be the busiest getaway day for Easter trips and staycations. If some drivers can leave on Thursday or early Saturday, they may miss some of the jams.” While the Department of Transport urged holidaymakers to plan ahead and allow extra time for travel, long queues were already forming near the port of Dover on Thursday morning. The transport minister, Robert Courts, said his department was “working closely with operators to minimise disruption”. P&O had planned to resume cross-Channel services between Dover and Calais for the Easter weekend, but the MCA said on Wednesday it would not release the two vessels until the agency was satisfied they could “fulfil the requirement of the Port State Control regime and are safe to put to sea”. The agency, which is inspecting all eight of P&O Ferries’ vessels, first detained the Pride of Kent on 28 March after a failed inspection and said on Wednesday that it had found additional deficiencies after a reassessment. The Spirit of Britain was detained this week, compounding troubles for the firm, which is under fire for sacking all 800 of its UK workforce and replacing them with cheaper foreign agency workers in March.",News/Business,P&O Ferries suspends passenger services across Channel over Easter,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/14/po-ferries-suspends-passenger-services-channel-easter-dover-calais-travel-uk-bank-holiday-weekend
