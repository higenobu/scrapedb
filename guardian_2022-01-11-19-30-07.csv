1/11/2022,"The UK’s main statistical body has reported more than 175,000 deaths involving Covid since the start of the pandemic. The ONS has reported 176,035 deaths where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate since March 2020. The figure differs significantly from the government’s official count – which exceeded 150,000 deaths over the weekend – which requires patients to have had a positive test within 28 days before their death.  The ONS figures are considered to be more accurate but due to delays in death registration they are not as up-to-date as the government figures. This latest release takes the 2021 death toll to 81,037, down from 94,998 in 2020. However, the figures for more recent dates may still be revised upwards, especially because the number of deaths registered in the last week of the year will have been affected by the Christmas and Boxing Day bank holidays, which means they will not yet have been recorded. A total of 3,891 people have died of Covid since the first case of the Omicron variant was discovered in the UK on 27 November. The average lag between infection and deaths is 16-18 days and can be up to eight weeks, according to the ONS, so the Omicron death toll may increase further in coming weeks. The number of deaths this winter has not yet come near the peak of previous waves despite a huge surge in Omicron cases. On 29 December, 246,000 new cases were confirmed, smashing previous records set. There have been more than 7,000 deaths in November and December this year, compared with about 30,000 in November and December 2020. Kit Yates, co-director of the Centre for Mathematical Biology at the University of Bath, said: “We can expect both of these [death] figures [from the ONS and the government’s official count] to continue to rise for some time reflecting the huge rises in infections that we’ve seen and the fact that cases have moved up the age ranges impacting more vulnerable older people.” “Even so we wouldn’t expect to see deaths get close to the disastrous figures we saw at this time last year and during the first wave, when we saw over 9,000 deaths a week. In large part this is due to the vaccination/booster programme, which has delivered good protection against severe disease and death. Of the deaths registered in the last week of December in England and Wales, 582 mentioned Covid, or 6.9% of all deaths, a decrease on the previous week when there were 852 deaths, or 6.5% of deaths in the week to Christmas Eve.",News/World news,"UK Covid death toll has passed 175,000, says ONS",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/uk-covid-death-toll-ons
1/11/2022,"My husband and I recently got married. He was a virgin at the time and I am puzzled by the fact that he doesn’t ejaculate or orgasm. He assures me that he likes our time together but I worry he may have some underlying issue that he should get checked out. The sex is amazing for me as I have multiple orgasms but we want to have children and I am scared that will not happen easily. There are ways to conceive without intercourse and climax. But in terms of his sexual health, it would be important to know if he has ever ejaculated (perhaps while sleeping?) or had an orgasm. If not, he should certainly have a checkup. But some people – for example, those who grew up in households where there was a highly punitive attitude towards developing sexuality – do not naturally glean an understanding of their sexual selves, or discover how their genitals work through self-exploration and masturbation. Such people usually have to learn about their sexual responses as adults, and making love with an adult partner can be challenging. Try to start a very gentle, non-threatening conversation with him that might begin: “I really love having sex with you, but it seems a little bit one-sided so I am curious about what exactly gives you pleasure?” Perhaps you can jointly discover the answer.

1/11/2022,"“Afree, fair and credible election.” These words of promise echo throughout Camilla Nielsson’s riveting documentary, capturing the fervour of the 2018 presidential vote in Zimbabwe, the country’s first without Robert Mugabe since its independence. While opening with the rip-roaring rallies for Nelson Chamisa, who is running for the presidency against the incumbent Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe’s former aide, President is more than an intimate portrait of a charismatic opposition leader. Considering the fraudulent electoral practices that existed under Mugabe’s 30-year reign, this election concretises a collective cry for democracy to triumph over decades of corruption and lies. Such a desire, alas, comes with blood, sweat and tears.  Punctuating the rousing scenes of Chamisa’s campaign trail – he draws support from both urban and rural voters – is the gritty behind-the-scenes grind at the opposition party’s headquarters. At times, the documentary plays like a political thriller as Chamisa staffers frantically gather intel on the outcome of what increasingly looks like a rigged election in favour of Mnangagwa. The tense atmosphere of these office corridors is juxtaposed with the protests on the streets, where pressure has boiled over into physical altercations between Chamisa voters and the police, who fire live bullets at the dissenting crowd, killing six. As Mnangagwa is sworn into office, both Chamisa’s efforts to challenge the result in court as well as his supporters’ guerrilla demonstrations prove futile. Still, this is far from a defeatist film: what President does well is show that linear narrative is not necessarily the point in the fight for democracy. Victory might not be immediate, but the people’s hope for change will never die.  President is released on 14 January in cinemas.",Arts/Film,President review – an intimate look at Zimbabwe’s collective cry for democracy freedom,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/11/president-review-an-intimate-look-at-zimbabwes-collective-cry-for-democracy-freedom
1/11/2022,"By this time next year, the 2022 World Cup will have come and gone. Soccer’s great and good will have descended on Qatar for the most controversial tournament in the sport’s history, and they’ll have left again. New world champions will have been crowned. Whether or not the US men’s national team will have participated, though, is still unknown. As things stand, Gregg Berhalter’s team stand a good chance of being in Qatar. The USA occupy second place in the final round of qualifying – Concacaf’s first ever ‘octagonal’ – with more than half the fixtures played. The ghosts of 2018 World Cup qualifying still haunt American soccer, nobody is taking anything for granted, but it would be a shock if, from this position of strength, the USA didn’t make the 2022 tournament.  Berhalter has systematically found solutions in most areas of the pitch since his appointment as head coach three years ago. His midfield is now a well-established unit with the USA’s defense in better shape than it was a year ago. Christian Pulisic, Gio Reyna, Timothy Weah and Brenden Aaronson also give the squad real quality in the attacking midfield and wide positions. Up front, though, there is still a position to be earned. Berhalter has options, but none to build around this far out from the World Cup at the end of the year. Some countries are lucky enough to have a world class number nine to elevate their level – see Robert Lewandowski for Poland and Harry Kane for England – but the US don’t have that. Not yet, anyway. In the eyes of many, Ricardo Pepi could potentially be that figure. The 18-year-old striker has only just completed a $20m move to Augsburg where he is expected to be a first-team player in the Bundesliga. Succeed in Germany and Pepi will surely be Berhalter’s first pick to play as his number nine at the World Cup (assuming the USA qualify). 2021 was a breakthrough year for Pepi at international level with the teenager called into Berhalter’s squad for the first time in August. He scored his first USA goal on his debut against Honduras in World Cup qualifying the following month and backed it up with a brace in a win over Jamaica the month after that. Pepi is a penalty box poacher. Flanked by top quality wide man, the teenager will get goalscoring opportunities for the USA. Pepi is also capable of creating chances for himself on the dribble. Anticipation and technical ability on the ball make the former FC Dallas youngster a good fit for Berhalter’s system and general approach. “We’re all excited,” Berhalter said when asked to describe Pepi’s potential. “For us, we’re just sitting there and we’re on the train. He’s an 18-year-old who gets an opportunity, takes advantage. What you see and I think what I really like is that he has this instinct, and it’s really hard to teach that to players.” Daryl Dike is another young American forward who could feasibly play a big role for the USA at the 2022 World Cup with the 21-year-old also making the move to a new club this month, joining West Brom in a reported $9.5m deal from Orlando City. Dike already has English Championship experience having flourished in a loan spell at Barnsley last season and has been signed to spearhead the Baggies’ promotion challenge. On talent alone, there might not be much between Dike and Pepi, but Berhalter’s system favors the latter. Indeed, the USA might not need a battering ram like Dike to lead the line in Qatar, although a good 2022 at club level for West Brom would surely see him included in the World Cup squad as a depth option at the very least. Josh Sargent stands a good chance of being included in Berhalter’s 23-man squad, although the 21-year-old’s underwhelming form for Norwich City has called into question his role for the USA. In contrast, Jordan Pefok has scored an impressive 16 goals in 30 games, including five in European competition (and one against Manchester United), for Young Boys this season, ensuring that the 25-year-old will be mentioned in any discussion over who should start up front at the World Cup. A flurry of goals by Matthew Hoppe for Schalke in the final stages of last season thrust another young American forward into focus only for the Barca Residency Academy graduate to fade into obscurity at Real Mallorca, where he has started just one league match since joining in the summer. Meanwhile, Gyasi Zardes, a relative veteran at 30 years old, remains a reliable option and a favourite of Berhalter’s. The prospect of playing Pulisic as a ‘false nine’ has even been raised, particularly after being used in this position by Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel. Pulisic, of course, is a winger by trade. That he is even been mentioned as a potential number nine with the 2022 World Cup on the horizon highlights how the USA still have to settle on a frontman. With the 2022 World Cup being a winter tournament, there is still time for the aforementioned contenders to secure their place in Berhalter’s plans, but the transfer activity that has involved the likes of Pepi, Dike and Sargent in the last six months proves the race to be the USA’s starting number nine in Qatar has already started.",Sport/Football,America’s next top striker: who will be Berhalter’s first choice in Qatar?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/11/usmnt-striker-qatar-world-cup
1/11/2022,"Like most Canadians, residents of the city of Hamilton, Ontario, are well used to waking to find their yards and houses coated in a mantle of white. But when they left their houses on a recent morning, they were surprised to realise that it was not snow that had fallen in the night. At first, Adrienne Van Halem, thought the city authorities had accidentally sprayed salt across the road, sidewalks and yards of her neighbourhood.  “But when I got closer, I realized it wasn’t salt at all. There were white husks covering everything,” she said. “It was a snowfall of soybeans.” She shared images of her car to Reddit and a neighbourhood group on Facebook, where some urged her to quickly contact the city. Others, however said that the occasional dump of soya bean husks was part of life in Hamilton, an industrial city an hour north from Toronto. “Growing up [here] the snow was black and the car was dirty … living near any factory … be prepared to have pollution and fall out,” wrote one user. Van Halem, who lives down the street from a soy processing plant operated by US-based Bunge, contacted the company to see if they had an explanation. The next day, she received a voice mail confirming the soy husks had been accidentally released after a filter malfunctioned. “While the hulls discharge posed no health or safety risk to either neighbours or employees, we understand that the residue was an annoyance for our neighbours,” Bunge spokesperson Deb Seidel told CBC News. Van Halem says she received a gift certificate for a local car wash’s cheapest cleaning package from the St Louis-based company, whose revenues in 2020 exceeded $40bn. “I appreciate the gesture because my car is still dirty from it,” said Van Halem. “And I get that it’s one of the realities that comes with living in a semi-industrial area.” She and her husband were aware that food processing sites had a history of accidentally releasing products into the air when they recently bought their house. In 2020, a factory accidentally dumped sugar on a neighbourhood. “But it didn’t leave a great taste in my mouth that the company didn’t seem to realise it had happened until neighbours started complaining.”",News/World news,Winter of soya beans: Canada city experiences bizarre snowfall,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/canada-ontario-soybean-snowfall

1/11/2022,"Labour has accused Boris Johnson of repeatedly misleading or obfuscating in the House of Commons and in interviews during questions about lockdown breaches in Downing Street. Here are the moments Johnson denied rules were broken.  After the Mirror’s first story broke about Christmas parties in Downing Street: “What I can tell the right hon and learned gentleman is that all guidance was followed completely in No 10.” Asked why he would not explain his account of the allegations, Johnson said: “Because I have told you and what I want to repeat … that the guidance is there and I am very, very keen that people understand this.” When asked about Downing Street Parties in December, the prime minister said: “All the guidelines were observed.” After the Allegra Stratton video is released by ITV News: “I apologise for the impression that has been given that staff in Downing Street take this less than seriously. I am sickened myself and furious about that, but I repeat what I have said to him: I have been repeatedly assured that the rules were not broken. I repeat that I have been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken.” Asked why he had not extended the No10 inquiry: “ … all the evidence I can see, people in this building have stayed within the rules … if that turns out not to be the case … and people wish to bring allegations to my attention or to the police … then of course there will be proper sanctions …” Asked again about Downing Street parties: “I can tell you once again that I certainly broke no rules … all that is being looked into.” ""I certainly broke no rules""Prime Minister Boris Johnson responds to further questions regarding a number of Christmas parties that allegedly took place in Downing Street last year.

1/11/2022,"Scars left by the Covid-19 pandemic have deepened the global divide between rich and poor countries and will make it harder to find common cause in the fight against global heating, according to the World Economic Forum. A WEF report puts climate or environment-related threats in the top five slots in its list of the 10 long-term risks but warned a “vaccine divide” was making collaboration to limit temperature increases more difficult.  In its annual global risks survey, the WEF – which has postponed its annual meeting in Davos until the summer because of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant – said the mood among its members was downbeat. Only 16% of those who responded to the survey said they were optimistic about the outlook for the world, and just 11% believe the global recovery will accelerate. Most respondents envisaged the next three years to be marked by either volatility and shocks or by a widening of the gap between winners and losers. Saadia Zahidi, the WEF managing director, said: “Health and economic disruptions are compounding social cleavages. This is creating tensions at a time when collaboration within societies and among the international community will be fundamental to ensure a more even and rapid global recovery. “Global leaders must come together and adopt a coordinated multi-stakeholder approach to tackle unrelenting global challenges and build resilience ahead of the next crisis.” Looking 10 years ahead, the WEF report found failure to act on climate change to be the biggest global risk, followed by extreme weather, biodiversity loss, natural resource crises and human environmental damage. Peter Giger, the group chief risk officer at Zurich insurance group, which helped to put together the report, said: “The climate crisis remains the biggest long-term threat facing humanity. “Failure to act on climate change could shrink global GDP by one-sixth and the commitments taken at Cop26 are still not enough to achieve the 1.5 centigrade goal. It is not too late for governments and businesses to act on the risks they face and to drive an innovative, determined and inclusive transition that protects economies and people.” The report said the economic fallout from the pandemic was adding to already existing pressures – such as widening digital, education and skills gaps – that risked splitting the world into different trajectories. “In some countries, rapid vaccine rollout, successful digital transformations and new growth opportunities could mean a return to pre-pandemic trends in the short term and the possibility of a more resilient outlook over a longer horizon,” it said. “Yet many other countries will be held back by low rates of vaccination, continued acute stress on health systems, digital divides and stagnant job markets. These divergences will complicate the international collaboration needed to address the worsening impacts of climate change, manage migration flows and combat dangerous cyber-risks.” Respondents to the survey said the two years since the start of the pandemic had led to heightened “societal risks”. Mental health had deteriorated, livelihoods had been damaged and social cohesion eroded, they said.",News/World news,"Covid has undermined fight against global heating, says WEF",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/covid-has-undermined-fight-against-global-heating-says-wef
