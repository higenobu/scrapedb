2/19/2022,"Experts have called for continued caution in the government’s “living safely with Covid” plan in England adding that scrapping self-isolation would be “very unwise”. On Monday, Boris Johnson is expected to outline the strategy, which will include expanding freedoms to pre-pandemic levels.  Among the new measures, free home-delivered lateral flow tests (LFTs) for all are likely to be scrapped and the legal requirement for anyone with Covid-19 to isolate is expected to end towards the end of the month. However, Dr David Nabarro, the World Health Organization’s special envoy on Covid-19, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he did not support the ending of self-isolation. “I think it’s really very unwise and I don’t understand why that’s been introduced,” he said. “I appreciate their concerns about absenteeism … but at the same time, what we know about this virus is that it is not good for people and simply just treating it as though it is a harmless virus we think – that’s myself and colleagues in the World Health Organization – we think that’s unwise.” He also warned against dropping face coverings and social distancing. “The best way to prevent other people from being infected with the virus is the combination of a well-fitting face mask and physical distancing,” he said. “And that has to continue, especially in places where there’s a lot of virus around. If it’s dropped, it is I believe, creating an unacceptable risk for people.” He called for “unequivocal” messaging, as well as world leaders to set the “example”, adding that continued caution regarding the virus was essential. “I think every society is going to have to live with Covid,” he said. “This virus is not going away anytime soon. But living with Covid doesn’t mean just accepting whatever the virus chooses to do. And so what matters is what’s going to be in this plan. I haven’t seen it so speculation is a bit tricky, but I think what I’ve been looking for is clear recognition that this is still a dangerous virus.” On the impact of the new plan, Nabarro said it could influence other countries’ measures. “I really do worry that if Britain is taking a line that is against the public health consensus that other countries, others leaders, will say, ‘If Britain’s doing it why can’t we?’ and this will create a bit of a domino effect around the world.” Meanwhile, the statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter argued that some form of the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) coronavirus study should remain in place as part of the government’s plan. Spiegelhalter, who acknowledged his conflict of interest as a non-executive director for the ONS and chairman of the advisory board for the Covid Infection Survey, told the Today programme: “I would say it (the study) is the envy of the world – I would say that, wouldn’t I? “But I should say that the president of the Royal Statistical Society has a letter in Saturday’s Guardian arguing the incredible statistical importance of some kind of health surveillance survey – it’s expensive and funding is being considered.” He added that such a survey “does seem incredibly important as we move forward”. With regard to the ONS’s random Covid-19 survey, he said: “As a statistician, it has been absolutely so important as we have gone along. “It has been running since April 2020, and so, as I said, I do have a bias here but it is not just me – I think lots of people are saying how important it is, particularly the statistical community.” ",News/World news,"England’s plan to scrap Covid self-isolation ‘unwise’, experts warn",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/england-plan-to-scrap-covid-self-isolation-unwise-experts-warn
2/19/2022,"Briefly raised hopes of averting a “horrendous” war in Ukraine are fading again after the US predicted an invasion in the “next several days” and British officials said they believed Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, had decided to attack. The mood in Washington and London had shifted abruptly after Russian-backed separatists shelled Ukrainian targets in the disputed eastern Donbas region. Moscow claimed Kyiv’s forces opened fire first. Clashes are continuing.  US president Joe Biden said that Russia was “engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in” and was increasing, not reducing, troop numbers. That analysis was echoed in other Nato and EU countries, which are preparing punitive sanctions. Diplomatic efforts to halt the slide to war are not yet exhausted. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Europe this week – assuming there is no invasion. They will discuss Russia’s demands, delivered in writing last week, for a Nato withdrawal from eastern Europe and curbs on US missile deployments. Lavrov will also insist Ukraine be permanently denied Nato membership. In the documents, which are a formal response to American proposals for continued dialogue, Russia warns it will be forced to take measures of an unspecified “military-technical character” if its concerns are not addressed. Western leaders, including Boris Johnson, Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, and Ukraine’s president will discuss the crisis this weekend at the annual Munich security conference. Unusually, Russia and China will not attend. Meanwhile, global stock markets reacted badly to increased fears of war, with share prices falling sharply. Gloom about the prospects for peace overwhelmed a midweek surge of optimism, sparked when predictions that Russia would invade last Wednesday proved wrong. Instead, Putin said he was pulling back some forces from Ukraine’s border. It seemed catastrophe had been averted. Yet within hours US and Nato officials were claiming the pullback was illusory. The White House flatly accused Russia of lying, saying troop numbers have swelled to around 150,000. For his part, Putin alleged, without evidence, that “genocide” against ethnic Russians was under way in the Donbas – another possible pretext for invasion. He continues to insist his troops are withdrawing and that there is no intention to attack Who and what to believe? The next few days could be a turning point. Or the stand-off could drag on inconclusively for months. The only certainty is that the future of Ukraine, and of relations between Russia and the west, hangs in the balance this weekend. Although an armed invasion has not yet happened, the 2022 “war for Ukraine” is already being waged on multiple non-military, political, diplomatic, economic, technological and covert fronts. So who’s winning so far? The question on everyone’s lips: what does Putin want? One theory is this former low-level KGB officer and part-time taxi driver has a massive chip on his shoulder. He has a small man’s visceral need to prove his (and Russia’s) superiority to the western victors of the cold war – but also to the former Soviet elites, from whose ranks he was excluded. A less complex explanation is that Putin views Ukraine as an integral part of historical Russia and Ukrainians and Russians as one people. He claims Ukraine is not a real country. For him, re-absorption into the fatherland is natural and logical, while efforts by Kyiv’s leaders to align with the west are anathema. Experts say Putin is intent on recreating the supposed glories of the Soviet era. He calls the collapse of the Soviet Union a geopolitical tragedy. Looked at this way, a conquest of Ukraine is part of a larger scheme to rebuild a Russian sphere of influence encompassing eastern Europe and central Asia. More mundanely, Putin’s actions can be explained by genuine fear that Russia’s security is threatened, his (disputed) belief that Nato broke a pledge not to expand up to Russia’s borders, and concern that it may accept Ukraine’s membership. Putin, a de facto dictator, feels threatened by a pro-western, democratic Ukraine on his doorstep. Is he winning? Putin has succeeded in forcing the west to consider his security concerns. He has intimidated Ukraine. And he has reminded a rattled Europe of its dependency on Russian gas. At the same time, he has hugely reinvigorated Nato, permanently changed western security assumptions, united the US and Europe against him, and reinforced Russia’s reputation as a rogue state that ignores international law and breaks its word. The US president was relatively quick out of the blocks over Ukraine. He needed to be. Last year’s chaotic US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and the resulting damage to Nato’s credibility were laid at his door. With Covid and economic woes already hurting his domestic approval ratings, Biden could not afford a repeat foreign policy disaster. Having made promotion of democracy and human rights around the world a key foreign policy objective, Biden could also not stand back as Russia threatened a free, independent, democratic state. Biden’s approach to the crisis is influenced by two additional strategic factors. One is his aim to reboot the transatlantic alliance, undermined by his predecessor Donald Trump. The other is his desire to demonstrate to China, Russia’s ally, that the US will stoutly support its friends, be they in Ukraine or Taiwan. Biden has sent US troops to reinforce Nato’s eastern flank, assured Kyiv of non-military US support, and stiffened European backbones via an intense diplomatic offensive. In an unusual step, the US continues to disclose detailed (mostly unsubstantiated) intelligence about Russian intentions in an apparent attempt to pre-empt and forestall Putin’s next move. Biden’s tactics may have succeeded in heading off an invasion until now. There are two large caveats. One is that Washington’s attempts to find a diplomatic solution have struggled, while its tough stance may have compromised European efforts. This vacuum is dangerous. The other big reservation is that Biden controversially vowed from the start that US forces would not fight to defend non-Nato Ukraine – despite past US interventions in non-Nato Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere. Putin could yet take catastrophic advantage of this most un-American display of caution. The attitude of Ukraine’s president to the unfolding crisis has surprised some in the west. Criticising alarming claims in Washington and London about an “any day” invasion, Zelenskiy said such suggestions risked causing panic and harming his country’s economy. As Russian military pressure increased last week, the official tone in Kyiv shifted. But by and large Ukrainians appear unimpressed by frantic talk of war. A “day of unity” last Wednesday – the supposed invasion D-day – was not widely supported. As western diplomats and nationals hastily evacuate, most Ukrainians are firmly staying put. One explanation is that people have learned to live with threats from Russia. Low-intensity conflict with Russian-backed Donbas separatists has become the new normal since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea. Last week’s passage of a resolution in the Russian Duma (parliament) supporting independence for the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics” in the Donbas was an attempt to increase Putin’s leverage. Such a unilateral move would spell the end for the so-called Minsk accords, whose terms are disputed by both sides. Ukraine’s aspiration to join Nato lies at the heart of the crisis. Zelenskiy is being pressed by European governments to drop this objective, a key Russian demand, and adopt a neutral, non-aligned status. So far at least, the Kyiv government, cast in the role of underdog, has benefited from increased international support, weapons deliveries and financial aid. It says any war would be about Europe’s future, not just Ukraine’s. True or not, Ukrainians will be the big losers if Putin resorts to force. Emmanuel Macron, the French president who also holds the rotating presidency of the EU council of ministers, has thrust himself into the diplomatic frontline. As the Americans and Russians haggled over Moscow’s demands for new security arrangements in Europe, Macron met Putin in Moscow and sketched possible compromises. These ideas, including recognition of Russian concerns about Nato expansion, its forward deployments in eastern Europe, and current and future US missile capabilities in Poland and Romania, may yet provide the basis for a deal. Macron also raised the possibility of Ukraine adopting neutral status, not unlike Finland during the cold war. Macron publicly supports the US-orchestrated plan to impose severe sanctions on Russia should it invade, and insists he acts in close consultation with Washington. But his Moscow talks raised eyebrows. British officials accused him of appeasement and of undermining the west’s united front. While Macron can shrug off criticism from London, he needs the backing of Germany, the biggest European player. But Olaf Scholz, its newly elected chancellor, has appeared in two minds. On the one hand he wants to salvage the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia. On the other he is under intense pressure from Biden to abandon it in support of anti-Kremlin sanctions. Yet Scholz surprised his critics last week when he met Putin in Moscow. He delivered a feisty performance, raising questions about media freedom and human rights. That may have reassured hawkish allies such as Poland and the Baltic republics, which have accused him of being “soft” on Russia. At the same time, Scholz extracted a commitment from Putin to continue dialogue in line with Macron’s approach. The EU commission has been sidelined during the crisis. But the French and German leaders have emerged with reputations enhanced. So far. Beset by scandals arising from illegal lockdown parties and reportedly anxious to change the subject, Boris Johnson seized on the Ukraine crisis in late January after having previously largely ignored it. At his direction Downing St began briefing about a big, cross-departmental Whitehall push to tackle the crisis. Britain, Johnson claimed, would lead western attempts to deter to Russia. But saying it does not make it so. Suggestions that this new effort to aid Ukraine was part of so-called Operation Save Big Dog to rescue his career were denied, naturally. The UK has since sent extra troops to Estonia, missiles to Ukraine, and placed Royal Navy ships on alert. It is typically iffy about accepting refugees, but has offered humanitarian aid. But Britain’s emphasis on muscular deterrence has come at the expense of diplomacy. It has contributed almost nothing to peace-making efforts. When Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, met Lavrov in Moscow, their talks ended in an icy standoff. Johnson has gratuitously undermined Macron’s Moscow initiative while Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, spoke disparagingly of a “whiff of Munich”. Meanwhile, the government has yet to enforce effective measures to curb Russian money-laundering in London. All else aside, the Ukraine crisis has brutally underscored Britain’s diminished international influence abroad. Separated by choice from the EU, the UK is now viewed in Russia (and much of Europe) as little more than a cheerleader and errand boy for America. When Johnson asked Biden what else the UK could do in a phone call last week, the US president replied: “We’re not going anywhere without you, pal.” That summed up Britain’s war to date. The rule of thumb for post-Brexit foreign policy: ask politely what Washington wants, then follow directions.",News/World news,Ukraine-Russia crisis: who’s winning the international influence war?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/ukraine-russia-crisis-whos-winning-the-international-influence-war-russia-putin
2/19/2022,"The bestselling author Joanne Harris has turned down a US book deal after the publishers demanded she take out an “f-bomb” from the novel. The Chocolat author, who lives near Huddersfield in West Yorkshire, tweeted on Saturday: “Today I turned down a book deal in the US because they wanted to edit out my use of ‘the f-bomb’. I refused for two reasons: one, because I don’t use words accidentally. They matter. And second, because I don’t believe my use of the word ‘fuck’ harms anyone.”  Harris was this week appearing at the Faversham literature festival in Kent to talk about her latest novel, A Narrow Door. She said the US deal she had been offered was for a special mail-order book club edition of A Narrow Door, a twisty psychological thriller that already has a mass-market deal there. Today I turned down a book deal in the US because they wanted to edit out my use of “the f-bomb.” I refused for two reasons: one, because I don’t use words accidentally. They matter. And second, because I don’t believe my use of the word “fuck” harms anyone. Harris added: “I gave it some thought, and the decision was mine to take. That’s how publishing works, and I’m happy with my choice. “In context it was a characterisation device, and would have sounded weak if I’d taken it out. “But if an editor had pointed out an inadvertent error in the text – or something in the tone that might be hurtful – I would have listened, and most likely changed it. Standing up for the words I meant to use doesn’t mean refusing to change those I didn’t.” Harris said that she did not feel offended by the request from the publisher, which she described as a house with a strong “cosy” branding, adding, “I understand, but that’s not me”. “I made my choice and so did they,” she said. “I don’t remotely feel as if I’ve been ‘cancelled’.” There has been a flurry of censorious action in the US against books in recent weeks, ranging from the controversial Tennessee pastor Greg Locke leading a mass book-burning of copies of Harry Potter and Twilight because of their supposed “demonic influences”, to a spate of book-bannings by schools, which some American teenagers are kicking back against. Harris said she chose to make the decision public on the back of a discussion on social media prompted by John Boyne, the author of The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas, criticising the increasing use by authors and publishers of “sensitivity readers” to ensure that they are representing certain groups correctly or to avoid causing offence. Harris was quoted in the media on her thoughts, and expanded on them on her blog, where she wrote: “I think a lot of people (some of them authors, most of them not) misunderstand the role of a sensitivity reader. That’s probably mostly because they’ve never used one, and are misled by the word ‘sensitivity’, which, in a world of toxic masculinity, is often mistaken for weakness. To these people, hiring someone to check one’s work for sensitivity purposes implies a surrendering of control, a shift in the balance of power.” Her declining of the US book deal was, she said, an example of “how these professional choices are personal to us, and how we make them every day”.",Arts/Books,Author Joanne Harris turns down US book deal over censoring of ‘f-bomb’,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/19/author-joanne-harris-turns-down-us-book-deal-over-censoring-of-f-bomb
2/19/2022,"Earlier this month, Streatham rapper Dave closed the Brit awards wielding an electric guitar that shot flames out of its neck while he thumbed a lyrical solo. Behind him, a gospel choir provided a euphoric crescendo of melodies, while to his right stood rappers Ghetts, Meekz, Fredo and Giggs, all nodding emphatically to the flow of his bars. The O2 audience was on its feet, anointing this eight minutes of music as a rock star’s homecoming, proof that only three years after his debut album release, Dave can keep an arena rapt. That debut, 2019’s Psychodrama, won the Mercury prize for its canny blend of earworming hooks and dextrous lyrical content that took aim at everything from political apathy to the stigmatisation of mental health issues, all in the form of an extended confessional from Dave to his psychotherapist.  The nuances of this therapeutic self-revelation might not seem the most likely foundations for a fun live show, but it’s a niche that Dave has successfully harnessed for himself. He manages to straddle emotive lyricism with bombastic performance and, consequently, a chronology of his career highlights reads like a list of key live sets: a 2019 Glastonbury debut that went viral after he pulled a fan out of the crowd to match him word for word on Thiago Silva, his collaboration with AJ Tracey; a 2020 Brits debut where he performed the Psychodrama track Black on the piano and labelled Boris Johnson “a real racist”; and an ecstatic debut festival headline set at Manchester’s Parklife in 2021 that heralded an end to the city’s seemingly endless lockdowns. All of these performances trace Dave’s journey from sideman to headliner, sellout performer and now arena-filler. With the incendiary 2022 Brits performance acting as a teaser for his first stadium tour, he opens his run through the UK and Europe tonight in Nottingham. Just like the Brits, the first thing to note about Dave’s setup when he takes to the packed Motorpoint Arena is that here, too, there is fire. He is alone and unassumingly dressed in a blue-and-white tracksuit, pacing around the cavernous stage like a lion in a cage, while bursts of pyrotechnics punctuate his opening number, Verdansk. Where the solipsistic Psychodrama might not have seemed a fit for the arena stage, 2021’s follow-up LP, We’re All Alone in This Together, is largely targeted at getting an audience bouncing to a colossal sound system. Verdansk is a testament to that fact, prompting the largely teen audience to seamlessly spit back his Call of Duty-referencing lyrics, before smooth transitions into Top Boy soundtrack cut Professor X and 2021 single Titanium. Here are all the accompaniments of a stadium show: giant screens filled with liquid visuals, a central podium where Dave performs in the thick of the crowd, confetti cannon, a polished live band, even an outfit change (from a black to a white T-shirt). But when you take these flourishes away, Dave is playing this like it’s only a 200-capacity room, waving at audience members and taking impromptu breaks to explain the motives behind his lyrics. It’s an endearing approach that produces mixed results. On the one hand, his repeated insistence that we should “access our inner child” and strive to try new things with a youthful curiosity – as he demonstrates by getting out his guitar again to accompany a spoken-word version of In the Fire – produces a hushed reverence from the audience, caught off guard by the intimacy. On the other hand, his amateur guitar playing lacks the confidence he showed at the Brits, and it feels a little like we are willing him to succeed at a school talent contest. And yet this is perhaps where Dave’s greatness lies: in the capacity to try in front of thousands, even if he might fail; in his willingness to be vulnerable. That vulnerability is a truly remarkable feat, one that goes against every rap stereotype of machismo, and holds the audience in a space of safety, comfort and fun. “I’m trying so that I can be better,” Dave says as he rounds off his set. “Next time, I will be better and I want you all to be too.” To paraphrase the title of his latest record, we might be alone, but in moments such as these, as 10,000 people rap along to hits such as the Stormzy-featuring smash Clash, we are all smiling, we have forgotten our anxieties, and we are all alone together, watching Dave take his rightful place on an arena stage.",Arts/Music,Dave review – pyrotechnics and endearing vulnerability,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/19/dave-live-motorpoint-arena-nottingham-review-were-all-alone-in-this-together
2/19/2022," I do not, as a rule, keep up with the Kardashians. And I try to pay as little attention as humanly possible to the erratic antics of Kim Kardashian’s ex Kanye West (who recently changed his name to Ye). But over the last couple of weeks I’ve made something of an exception to my “avoid losing braincells through exposure to Kimye drama at all costs” rule because Ye’s public behaviour has become increasingly disturbing. Even more disturbing, however, is the way his behaviour towards Kardashian is largely being treated as entertaining gossip by the media instead of being called out as harassment. While a handful of (mainly women-focused) media outlets, including Elle and Jezebel, have sounded alarm bells at the way Ye is acting, his behaviour is still being dangerously downplayed. Some background for everyone who hasn’t been following the saga: Kardashian and Ye, who have four children, are in the middle of ending their nearly seven-year marriage. The divorce proceedings, initiated last February, have not been low-key: this is no Gwyneth Paltrow-esque “conscious uncoupling”. Things got even more acrimonious when Kardashian started dating the comedian Pete Davidson late last year: Ye started veering between over-the-top displays of affection towards Kim and outbursts of anger. A small sample of his recent behaviour includes: Sending a truck filled with roses and emblazoned with the words “MY VISION IS KRYSTAL KLEAR” on its side to Kardashian’s house for Valentine’s Day. Posting what seems to be private correspondence from Davidson online. Encouraging his fans to scream “Kimye Forever” at Davidson if they see him in public. Leaking what appear to be private text messages from Kardashian on social media. He later acknowledged this “came off as harassing Kim” but then continued to rail at her online. Publicly accusing Kardashian of kidnapping their daughter Chicago after she threw her a birthday party and allegedly refused to tell him the address. He also turned up at the birthday party despite reportedly having agreed to host a separate event for Chicago. A bizarre number of media outlets have characterized what’s happening between Kardashian and Ye as a “war of words”. But that implies that there is some sort of equivalence between their behaviour. There isn’t. Ye is harassing Kardashian and she is asking him to stop. Earlier this month she released a statement decrying his constant attacks on her in interviews and on social media. “Divorce is difficult enough on our children and Kanye’s obsession with trying to control and manipulate our situation so negatively and publicly is only causing further pain for all.” Obviously I don’t have all the facts when it comes to the relationship between Kardashian and Ye. However, what’s playing out in public feels depressingly familiar: a man is refusing to take no for an answer and it’s being treated as a silly spectacle instead of serious stalking. Here’s the problem: decades of Hollywood films and popular culture have taught us that it’s romantic for a man to aggressively pursue a woman who has spurned his advances. It’s taught us that a man showering a woman with unwanted gifts is a cute gesture, not manipulative love-bombing. Men relentlessly pursuing women is such a common theme of romcoms that the website TV Tropes, which tracks frequently used narrative devices, has an entry for it called “Stalking is Love”. (Of course, it’s only love when a man does it. If a woman so much as calls her ex up she’s immediately characterized as “crazy”.) In a 2016 paper on Hollywood’s depiction of “persistent pursuit” the researcher Julia Lippman found, unsurprisingly, that exposure to this trope normalies the behavior. “[T]he romanticized pursuit behaviors commonly featured in the media as a part of normative courtship can lead to an increase in stalking-supportive beliefs,” Lippman states. Once again, I have no idea what’s happening behind the scenes with Kardashian and Ye. But what’s happening in public should not be dismissed as entertainment; Ye’s online harassment should not be dismissed as harmless. Their divorce may be a private matter between the two of them but further normalizing the idea that persistent pursuit is romantic is harmful for everyone. The Hyde Amendment, first implemented in 1977, forbids the use of federal funds for abortions except in very narrow circumstances. What does that mean in practice? Vulnerable groups (who rely on public health programs like Medicaid) have a much harder time accessing abortions. During the elections the Democrats were full of big promises about how they were going to end the Hyde Amendment but now that they are actually in power it looks like they’re about to do what they do best: nothing. Remember when Joe Biden told rich donors at a fundraiser that, if he got elected, “nothing would fundamentally change”? He sure seems to be keeping that promise. The 30 selected women will drive bullet trains between the cities of Mecca and Medina after a year of paid training. Female participation in the workforce has nearly doubled in the last five years to 33%: a fact that the Saudi crown prince loves to use as PR to distract from the kingdom’s human rights violations, its persecution of women’s rights activists and its relentless airstrikes on Yemen. We can applaud the progress that’s being made for women in Saudi Arabia but let’s make sure to put it in perspective. In January Michelle Go was pushed to her death on to a subway track. On Sunday, Christina Yuna Lee was stalked and stabbed by a man who followed her into her Chinatown apartment. Neither have been official classified as a hate crime but the horrific attacks have reignited conversations about how Asian women are targets of both hyper-sexualization and racism. A disproportionate number of anti-Asian racist incidents target women. It’s great that Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s CEO, is helping to normalize men taking time off for childcare. However, it’s beyond depressing that a man taking care of his kid is still considered headline news. At least seven players on the gold-winning Canadian women’s ice hockey team are openly LGBTQ+. New research has found that young men who exhibited more dependent behaviour as children had a 6% decline in earnings as adults. Girls who were characterized as headstrong growing up had a 10% decline in earnings. So that’s why I’m not a millionaire, eh? Big news in the bug world this week: London’s National History Museum has confirmed that a pet green bean stick insect called Charlie is male and female. That’s a “gynandromorph” if you’re being fancy. Charlie is apparently the “first reported gynandromorph” in that species and has now been donated to the museum for scientific research.

2/19/2022,"Since Raveena Aurora first emerged in 2017, the New York-based singer-songwriter’s sound has been imbued with an entrancing soft soulfulness. Predominantly creating in the realm of R&B, with nods to her Indian heritage have so far mainly been in the aesthetics – self-directed videos in which she and her peers drip in traditional gold jewellery. Her impressive debut album, 2019’s Lucid, explored family history, trauma, spirituality and relationships, largely over more standard R&B and neo-soul-type instrumentation, occasionally veering into more psych-tinged, Alice Coltrane-esque celestial harps. On Asha’s Awakening, Raveena’s new album (her first on a major label), the 27-year-old’s direction feels more outward-looking, burrowing into her south Asian roots in bold, fantastical, high-concept fashion. Asha, we are told, is a space princess from ancient Punjab who is adventuring through the centuries, singing of love, loss and fate. The album plays with Bollywood film music stylings: shimmying trills of tabla rhythms, pitchy twangs of guitar, colourful smatterings of electronics, coy new age-y lyrics (“I can open up your third eye”) and Raveena occasionally singing in breathy, silky Hindi.  Features from rapper Vince Staples and Asha Puthli, a cult Indian singer-songwriter experimentalist, are testament to how vast Raveena’s world can be. She has always been a pleasure to listen to, but her charm and talent on this fully formed new release are undeniable, threading past and present into her own glorious, cosmic future.

2/19/2022,"The former boss of a French model agency accused of rape and questioned on suspicion of supplying underage girls to the late American financier Jeffrey Epstein has been found hanged in prison. The body of Jean-Luc Brunel, 75, was found on Saturday morning in his cell. The French prosecutors’ office confirmed the report and said an inquiry had been opened into the cause of death.  Brunel was arrested in December 2020 at Charles de Gaulle airport before boarding a plane for Dakar. He was under investigation on allegations of the alleged rape of minors and sexual harassment. Investigators had also questioned Brunel on suspicion of the human trafficking of underage girls for sexual exploitation. He was being held on remand in La Santé prison in Paris. Several top models had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault and rape and French police had reportedly interviewed hundreds of potential witnesses. Brunel had denied any wrongdoing. In the 1990s, Paris-born Brunel was a model talent scout and boss of the agency Karin Models. After he was banned from the agency in European 1999 following a BBC undercover report on abuse in the fashion industry, he moved to the US and founded MC2 Model Management with funding from Epstein. He is credited with discovering a number of supermodels including Christy Turlington and Milla Jovovich. He met Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s partner, in the 1980s and she had introduced him to Epstein. Brunel had been released on bail last November but had been ordered to return to prison to await trial.
