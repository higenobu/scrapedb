2/3/2022,"Whoopi Goldberg's suspension from The View didn't become a hot topic on Wednesday. In the first show since she was given a two-week timeout from the show over comments she made about the Holocaust, her absence was just briefly mentioned at the top of the show. ""Good morning and welcome to The View,"" co-host Joy Behar, subbing at moderator, said when the ABC talk show kicked off. ""You all saw the news: Whoopi will be back here in two weeks.""¬† Behar then paused, nodded her head, and then continued on, ""Ok‚Ä¶"" announcing the show's guest co-host for the day, Tara Setmayer. They then immediately launched into ""Hot Topics,"" none of which related to their own hot topic.¬† The controversy stems from Goldberg repeatedly saying during Monday's show that the Holocaust was not about race. The co-hosts had been discussing a Tennessee school board‚Äôs ban of Maus, a nonfiction graphic novel about cartoonist Art Spiegelman‚Äôs father‚Äôs experience surviving the Holocaust. ""Let‚Äôs be truthful about it because [the] Holocaust isn‚Äôt about race,"" Goldberg said. ""It's not about race. It‚Äôs about man's inhumanity to man."" When Goldberg's co-hosts challenged that ‚Äî including Ana Navarro saying that the Holocaust was ""about white supremacy"" ‚Äî Goldberg said, ""But these are two white groups of people... This is white people doing it to white people, so y‚Äôall going to fight amongst yourselves.""¬† Goldberg's comments, at a time of rising antisemitism, were widely criticized, including by Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt and the Holocaust Museum. During World War II, approximately six million Jews ‚Äî about a third of the world's Jewish population at the time ‚Äî were killed by the Nazi regime and its allies and collaborators who believed the Jews were a weak, dangerous and inferior race. Goldberg apologized on Monday on social media and said on a guest appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that her words ""upset a lot of people, which was never, ever, ever my intention."" On Tuesday, she apologized again on the show and had Greenblatt as a guest to discuss it. However, Goldberg ‚Äî who has said in the past that she does not practice any religion, but identifies as Jewish (adopting her stage name, after being born Caryn Johnson, because of that) ‚Äî was suspended on Tuesday night. ‚ÄúEffective immediately, I am suspending Whoopi Goldberg for two weeks for her wrong and hurtful comments,"" Kim Godwin, president at ABC News, said in a statement. ""While Whoopi has apologized, I‚Äôve asked her to take time to reflect and learn about the impact of her comments. The entire ABC News organization stands in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends, family and communities."" Viewers of Wednesday's show were surprised that the suspension of the long-time moderator only got a brief mention. ""That's it?"" one person asked. Another said they ""expected more."" More than one said the show swept it under the rug. No, Joy only said ""you've seen the news. Whoopi is out for 2 weeks."" at the beginning of the show. That was it. No discussion. ‚Äî Jackie~üå≤üïä (@jdb231) February 2, 2022 Boy, did Joy sweep the Whoopi suspension under the rug! ‚Äî McAbbyüíó (@monk12343) February 2, 2022 Watched the opening of ""The View"", Joy's comment that she was sure we all heard the news and that Whoopi would be returning in 2 weeks. I expected more, I had hoped the co-hosts would not censor themselves but show loyalty. I shut it off after that. #Supportwhoopi ‚Äî cynsanity (@cynsanity1) February 2, 2022 I never watch ""The View"", but was curious to see how they would handle the whole Whoopi embroglio. All they did was have Joy Behar mention that Whoopi would be back in two weeks, and moved right on. ‚Äî Marc (@GDoc2001) February 2, 2022 Joy was like, ‚ÄúYou all saw the news, Whoopi will be back in two weeks. Let‚Äôs get to the news and‚Ä¶#TheView pic.twitter.com/jVXZFkLj29 ‚Äî Mohammed Olokode (@MohammedOlokod2) February 2, 2022 That's it? Joy, Whoopi will be back in two weeks. So will I. BYE BYE. #TheView ‚Äî donna johnson (@geomacjohnson) February 2, 2022 After the news broke of Whoopi Goldberg‚Äôs two week suspension, Sean Hannity came to the defense of The View co-host. Goldberg faced immediate backlash on Monday after she said on The View that the holocaust was ‚Äúnot about race,‚Äù but rather ‚Äúabout man‚Äôs inhumanity to man.‚Äù Goldberg was quick to issue an apology, but it wasn‚Äôt enough.
‚ÄúI think her apology is sincere. I think she's learned a lot in the process. If two weeks off is the penalty, it's better than being canceled,‚Äù Hannity said. ‚ÄúAnd I just ‚Äî I have just a reflexive reaction to cancel because I don't like what somebody says, because you don't have to watch The View. I hate to tell you, I don't watch The View.‚Äù
While Hannity agreed that Goldberg‚Äôs comment was wrong, he gave her credit for what she got right. But still questioned what made her say it in the first place.
‚ÄúShe recognized the evil, but did she not know the history, or did she just negate the history?‚Äù Hannity asked. ‚ÄúShe recognized evil, man‚Äôs inhumanity to man. Six million Jews were slaughtered. Millions others, slaughtered.‚Äù",World/Yahoo Celebrity,How Whoopi Goldberg's suspension over Holocaust comments was addressed on 'The View',https://news.yahoo.com/whoopi-goldberg-suspension-holocaust-comments-addressed-the-view-172326396.html
2/3/2022,"Susan Collins said it might be hard for Republicans to reject a Black, female Supreme Court nominee. She acknowledged that Democrats ""have had some success"" with painting the GOP as ""anti-Black."" Collins is one of few Republican senators who may vote in favor of Biden's nominee. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said this week that it might be difficult for Republicans to reject a Black, female Supreme Court nominee because of the political implications. ""The idea that race and gender should be the No. 1 and No. 2 criteria is not as it should be,"" Collins told The New York Times. ""On the other hand, there are many qualified Black women for this post and given that Democrats, regrettably, have had some success in trying to paint Republicans as anti-Black, it may make it more difficult to reject a Black jurist."" Collins is one of few Republicans who could vote in favor of Biden's nominee. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham also recently told Politico he supports President Joe Biden's decision to tap a Black woman for the Supreme Court. But other Republicans, like Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have vehemently opposed it and characterized Biden's pledge as ""offensive."" ""The fact that he's willing to make a promise at the outset, that it must be a Black woman, I got to say that's offensive,"" Cruz recently said on his podcast. He also went on to say that Biden's Supreme Court pick ""is actually an insult to Black women,"" despite the fact that Biden's hasn't nominated anyone yet. The president is currently weighing who to tap as a successor to Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, who announced his upcoming retirement from the bench last week. Biden pledged during the 2020 presidential campaign that he would nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court and has had record success in getting his judicial nominees confirmed by the Senate. In his first year in office, he's had 40 nominees confirmed to the federal bench. That's more than any president since Ronald Reagan: Bill Clinton and George W. Bush each got 23 appointments their first year, Barack Obama secured 13, and Donald Trump got 19. Biden has also had little trouble achieving his goals of diversfying the federal judiciary. According to a recent report from the Alliance for Justice, before Biden took office, women of color made up 20% of the US population but just 4% of sitting federal judges. Almost half of Biden's nominees and more than half of all his women nominees are women of color, the report said. The media and public have speculated at length about who Biden might nominate for the Supreme Court, and although the White House hasn't dropped any hints, some have stood out as being on the shortlist. The top two contenders are Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who sits on the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger. Jackson, 51, is widely seen as the frontrunner for the nomination. She previously clerked for Breyer, and Collins, Graham, and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski all voted to confirm to the DC appeals court, which is considered to be the second most powerful court in the country.

2/3/2022,"As the pandemic continues, long COVID-19 remains very prevalent (affecting between 31 and 69 percent of COVID-19 patients) and somewhat bewildering because there's no clear connection between the severity of a patient's initial symptoms and how long they might linger. That was one thing that Irina Petrache, MD, chief of the Division of Pulmonary at National Jewish Health in Denver, noticed early on in the pandemic. ""As the first survivors of COVID emerged, it became clear that many of them suffered from prolonged illness,"" Dr. Petrache tells POPSUGAR. But when Dr. Petrache and her fellow researchers looked at 50 such patients at their hospital, they realized that ""the vast majority of them did not have severe acute COVID,"" she says. ""They suffered from this acute viral infection at home, and they recovered without needing extra oxygen or needing to go to the hospital."" Those 50 patients helped form the basis of a new preliminary study, coauthored by Dr. Petrache, that attempted to pinpoint the causes of long COVID. The researchers came away with a striking discovery: that the virus was damaging the mitochondria in the cells of long-COVID patients. The mitochondria (as you might remember from high school biology) is a crucial organelle within the cell, tasked with turning oxygen and other nutrients into ATP, which is the energy that your muscles use to move and contract. Mitochondria are essentially ""little factories in all our cells that produce energy,"" Dr. Petrache says. When they're not working properly, it's a bad sign. Related: Study Links COVID Vaccine Symptoms to ""Nocebo Effect"" Phenomenon In the study, researchers asked patients to undergo cardiopulmonary exercise testing, which involved exercising on either a stationary bike or a treadmill and slowly increasing the resistance or incline to the point of fatigue. As they exercised, researchers recorded ""massive amounts of data,"" Dr. Petrache says, from heart rate and blood pressure to the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in their inhalations and exhalations. They also took arterial blood samples to measure carbon dioxide and lactate (a byproduct substance produced during exercise) in the blood. At first, the data didn't seem to add up. The researchers saw that their patients were tiring more quickly than expected, but on the surface, their lungs, hearts, and muscles seemed to function correctly. It wasn't until they looked on the cellular level that they realized what was happening. The abnormally fast rate at which lactate was rising, as well as clues from the gases that patients exhaled, suggested that the cause lay within the mitochondria. ""All these formulas and results pointed in the same direction: that there is something wrong with these little organelles,"" Dr. Petrache says. ""They're just not working like they should be."" Researchers don't know the exact mechanism by which SARS-COV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) affects the mitochondria, though this is not the first study to point out a connection. One possibility is that when the virus particles break into a cell, it causes a ""cascade of events"" that damages the mitochondria; specifically, Dr. Petrache says, the virus can lead to the release of a substance called angiotensin which, when accumulated in this way, can ""unlock"" the mitochondria and damage it. But Dr. Petrache notes that the pathway might be more indirect as well; the virus might affect the flow of oxygen in the bloodstream, which then deprives the mitochondria of fuel. It might also affect the life cycle of mitochondria, causing premature death to the organelles or slowing the production of new mitochondria. Finding the exact mechanism of the mitochondria dysfunction is one of the next steps Dr. Petrache hopes to take. ""All these permutations or possibilities are subject to research now,"" she says. ""We really want to pinpoint it."" To do that, they hope to expand their study, bringing in more long-COVID patients and adding a control group of people who recovered from their COVID-19 symptoms without a problem. Additionally, though this test looked at muscle function in long-COVID patients, the researchers believe the same process could be related to other long-COVID symptoms, such as lung or neurological issues. Related: Stealth Omicron: What We Know About the Latest Variant Dr. Petrache stresses that COVID-induced mitochondrial dysfunction needs to be studied in a controlled trial before potential treatments or interventions can be offered. However, she notes that a known intervention for mitochondrial issues is to ""start low and go slow"" with exercise, rather than abruptly leveling your exercise up or rushing through a fitness program. This slow and steady form of exercise, also known as ""Zone 2 exercise,"" is known to improve mitochondria function, Dr. Petrache says. It could help in the case of long COVID as well. In the long run, the hope is that this preliminary study will open the doors for more research into the connection between long COVID and mitochondria. Eventually, the goal is to find treatment options and a way forward for patients struggling with these symptoms. ""There was a lot of frustration that we saw in our [long-COVID] patients,"" Dr. Petrache says. ""Now we can reassure them that once those classical diagnoses [like heart disease or lung disease] have been ruled out, if they are fatigued post-COVID, if they have shortness of breath . . . then this could very well be the cause.""",Health/POPSUGAR,A New Study Finds a Link Between Long-Haul COVID Symptoms and Mitochondria Damage,https://news.yahoo.com/study-finds-between-long-haul-190947119.html
