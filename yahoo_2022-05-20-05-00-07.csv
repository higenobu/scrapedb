5/20/2022,"A woman from Rogers, Ark., is going viral after showing off the “fancy” Walmart Marketplace in her town. The video comes from a TikTok user named Sarah (@reallifesarah918). Her clip, shared on May 3, has since drawn almost 2 million views. Federal Reserve raises interest rates for first time since 2018 Sarah’s post follows an ongoing trend in which users share the supposedly upscale versions of everyday businesses and chains. In one video, a New Yorker showed off a “fancy” Home Depot store in midtown Manhattan. In another, an Australian woman shared her experience at KFC’s “fine dining” restaurant. The store depicted in Sarah’s video seems to be the Walmart Neighborhood Market at 5000 West Pauline Whitaker Parkway. As the TikToker showed at the start of her clip, the Walmart is near a seemingly expensive neighborhood. The Walmart itself, meanwhile, has a sort of gazebo-shaped entrance, complete with accents and tile roofing. Many TikTokers said they’d never seen a store like it. “Imagine the clothes in that Walmart,” one user wrote. “To me this feels like a different universe,” another added. “They actually MIGHT give Target a bit of a run for their money if every Walmart store looked like this,” another user commented. Designer Jerome LaMaar dishes what men should pack for a weekend getaway: Others commented on the fact that the “fancy” Walmart appeared to be located in a nice area. “Royalty status,” one user joked. “This video just told me I’m broke,” another added. However, as Sarah showed in a follow-up clip, the location is not as upscale as it appears. In fact, the inside seems to be the same as most other Walmart stores. Some TikTokers commented that they have similarly dressed-up Walmarts in their area, noting that the exterior could be designed to fit in with other buildings in the shopping center. Others pointed out that the Rogers location is extremely close to Walmart’s corporate headquarters, in Bentonville, Ark. In fact, the two towns are practically adjacent.

5/20/2022,"A Louisiana Army National Guard officer retired in March with benefits after being convicted of assault and conduct unbecoming an officer for ""motorboating"" an enlisted soldier during a promotion ceremony in Jordan in May 2021. Court documents show that Capt. Billy Crosby, a logistics officer with the 256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team who was deployed to Joint Training Center Jordan, initially was charged with conduct unbecoming an officer and abusive sexual contact. But during the proceedings, which were first reported by Army Times, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of assault consummated by battery and conduct unbecoming.

Jessica Rovero, a spokeswoman for 1st Theater Sustainment Command, said in an emailed statement to Military.com. ""Multiple Soldiers immediately reported the behavior, and Crosby pled guilty at trial."" According to court documents, Crosby told the junior soldier that he planned to ""motorboat"" her at her promotion ceremony to sergeant and did just that: placing his face between her breasts and ""moving it from side to side ... without the sergeant's consent"" during an impromptu ceremony initiated by Crosby on May 15, 2021. Witnesses corroborated the incident, with one telling investigators that Crosby had previously expressed interest in the sergeant, asking that she ride with him to another post in Jordan because he ""liked looking at her tits,"" court documents state. The day before the assault, the soldier told Crosby she did not want a promotion ceremony, according to the documents. The next day, however, Crosby ""approached [her], told her to stand up, placed the rank in front of her chest, leaned in to grab the rank with his teeth ... then placed his face between [the sergeant's] breasts ... [and] vigorously moved his head from side to side between [her] breasts while still holding the rank with his teeth."" Crosby was sentenced to 30 days in the brig and allowed to retire with benefits. He was not directed to pay any fines or sentenced to forfeiture of pay. He also was not required to register as a sex offender, given the lesser charge of assault. The National Guard Bureau has been under fire from advocates and members of Congress in the past several years for jurisdictional issues related to criminal cases on state and federal orders and its failure to investigate and prosecute cases of sexual assault and harassment.  The U.S. Army and Air Force have jurisdiction in cases that occur while soldiers and airmen are on federal orders, such as the Crosby case, but the services do not have the same authority when Guard members are on state orders. Romero said the Crosby proceedings were done in a manner that ""inspires trust in the process."" ""Throughout the court-martial, all parties were treated with dignity and respect,"" she said in her statement. A former enlisted soldier, Crosby deployed to Panama in 1989. His defense lawyers requested a character witness but were denied the opportunity. They argued that the prosecution tried to portray the captain as a ""creepy old guy."" Crosby told Stars and Stripes that he retired from the Louisiana Army National Guard on March 31. ""I was accused of a lot more than I done, and I pled guilty to what I did,"" he told the publication. -- Patricia Kime can be reached at Patricia.Kime@Military.com.

5/20/2022,"Former President Donald Trump worked his Pennsylvania primary endorsements to make him look like a winner, but exasperated Republicans in the state say the end result could boomerang in ways that damage both the party and Trump's own chances should he run for president in 2024. “This is the most cockamamie election I’ve ever seen in my life,” Dave Ball, the GOP chairman in Washington County, said in an interview. In the Senate race, Trump endorsed celebrity TV doctor Mehmet Oz, whose past liberal views made him anathema to many conservatives. Now he’s locked in a too-close-to-call race having received less than a third of the vote, according to NBC News. Three days before Election Day, Trump veered hard to the right in the governor's race by backing Doug Mastriano, the state senator who built a devoted grassroots following for his efforts to overturn President Joe Biden’s win and promote Trump’s stolen election lie. Mainstream Republicans fear that Mastriano, who had been on track to win the primary anyway before Trump's nod, is too extreme to win a general election in a state with a half million more registered Democrats than Republicans. A Democratic victory in the Pennsylvania contest for governor would reverberate through the 2024 presidential election cycle. The governor gets to appoint the secretary of state, who presides over elections in a swing state that was a focus of Trump’s bid to reverse his 2020 election loss. “I would think that he [Trump] would be very interested in Doug Mastriano moderating his message and trying to run as someone who can appeal to all Pennsylvanians,” said David Urban, a former Trump campaign adviser who helped him win Pennsylvania in 2016 (Trump lost the state in 2020). “It’s not lost on anybody that the governor of Pennsylvania plays an outsize role in the 2024 election. And Republicans should be concerned about that. They should be concerned about [Democratic nominee] Josh Shapiro as governor because he’s going to be the referee.” Republican unease is growing ahead of the next big contest on the calendar: Georgia. In no other state has Trump’s heavy hand so divided the party. Georgia Republicans are set to defy Trump in Tuesday’s primary by rallying behind one of his top targets, Gov. Brian Kemp, along with the state’s incumbent insurance commissioner and attorney general. Trump has recruited or endorsed candidates challenging them all. Yet even his own political operation has grown impatient with David Perdue, the former senator whom Trump recruited to take on Kemp. Trump advisers have told Perdue’s campaign they’d like to see him devote more energy to the race, said a person close to Trump who was not authorized to speak on the record. Trump remains the most popular figure in the GOP and his endorsement is campaign gold for Republican candidates. But his endorsements nationwide have triggered a backlash from local Republican leaders in Ohio, Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Georgia, where they feel as if Trump’s picks were haphazard, reckless or harmful to the party’s broader electoral objectives and even Trump’s long-term interests. Republican voters in Idaho and Nebraska also bucked Trump’s picks in their respective gubernatorial contests Tuesday and on May 10. “He endorsed candidates with no appeal to conservatives or candidates who aren’t qualified. It erodes his credibility to a degree,” said former Georgia state Rep. Scot Turner, a Republican. Turner noted Trump’s pick for Georgia attorney general, John Gordon, wasn’t a practicing lawyer for years and reactivated his law license in 2021 to take part in a failed lawsuit baselessly alleging election fraud. Turner also questioned the conservative bonafides of Trump’s pick in a Georgia congressional race, Vernon Jones, a former Democrat. A spokesman for Jones, C.J. Pearson, echoed Trump insiders by pointing out the power of his endorsement. “While the [former] president’s endorsement might not be of any importance to establishment lapdogs and political has-beens, it is important to the people of Georgia’s 10th Congressional District,” Pearson said. In Pennsylvania, Trump inflamed the situation even more after Election Day by calling on Oz to simply “declare victory” over fellow Republican David McCormick before all the ballots were counted. “It just makes it harder for them to cheat with the ballots that they ‘just happened to find,’” Trump said on his new social media site, Truth Social, without evidence of any fraud. Meanwhile, a source close to the McCormick campaign told NBC News Thursday that Trump is ""hedging his bet because he knows Oz is going to lose,"" when asked about Trump's push for Oz to declare victory while making baseless claims of cheating. Former state GOP chairman Rob Gleason said that “it’s just shocking” for Trump to essentially call for canceling Republican ballots cast in a Republican primary. “Bitterness has been developing over a period of time. It’s not just this election,” he said. “But this just didn’t help.” Last year, Trump initially anointed Sean Parnell as his chosen candidate in the Senate race. But Parnell hadn’t been fully vetted and he soon exited the race after losing a child custody battle with his estranged wife, who accused him of domestic violence, a charge Parnell denies. The field of candidates soon swelled, with McCormick and Oz entering the race, each vying for Trump’s endorsement. Trump stunned some locals by picking Oz, whose conservative bona fides were in doubt because of his past positions on guns, abortions, transgender rights and Covid lockdowns. “I think Trump stepped out in endorsing Oz … because he loves celebrity,” David La Torre, a former adviser to gubernatorial candidate Jake Corman, said in an interview. “He loves everything about celebrity, when it was obvious there were better choices for him to make.” The MAGA faithful were in open revolt at a Trump rally in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, where the crowd booed Oz. Trump responded by trashing McCormick as well as insurgent MAGA candidate Kathy Barnette, who trails both Oz and McCormick in the vote tally. Then, in the governor’s race, not only did nine candidates vie for the Republican nomination, but none dropped out until the last weekend. This prevented any consolidation of the field against Mastriano, a far-right state legislator who wants to “reset” the state’s voter rolls, virtually eliminate abortion rights and has campaigned with QAnon adherants. Enthusiastic supporters see him as God’s choice, while many Republicans view him as unelectable in a state where moderates traditionally perform well. “The frustration comes from there being so many candidates and the high level of voter confusion,” said Jackie Kulback, Republican chairwoman in Cambria County. For months, Trump did not weigh in on the governor’s race, except to put out a statement telling voters not to cast ballots for former U.S. Attorney Bill McSwain, who he argued hadn’t done enough to uncover evidence of voter fraud. As Mastriano surged, Trump on Saturday backed the state senator, who ultimately wound up winning by nearly 25 points, with 45 percent of the vote. “He waited so long and then when the final polls came out showing that Mastriano had a pretty significant lead, that’s when he chose to step in,” said Richard Stewart, co-chair of the state’s GOP Central Caucus, which represents 24 counties. “He just wanted a winner.” Trump also endorsed six congressional candidates in Pennsylvania, who had no or token opposition, thereby enabling him to claim that he’s 7-0 in the state, a record that would become 8-0 if Oz can hold on to his razor-thin lead. Former Pennsylvania Rep. Tom Marino, a Republican who backed Lou Barletta in the governor’s race and, like him, was one of the first members of Congress to back Trump’s candidacy in his initial run, told NBC News that it was “surprising how many people have come up to me and told me they’ve had it with Trump” because of the Mastriano endorsement. “I was surprised that when I brought home what Trump did to Lou — that he was disloyal — people cheered that and people were pissed off,” he added. What’s more, Trump’s endorsement of Mastriano may have ultimately hurt his endorsed Senate candidate, according to Marino and Barletta campaign insiders, who said that Barletta backers started flocking to McCormick out of anger. Barletta told people to vote for McCormick in the Senate race and did so himself, one campaign aide said. As of Thursday afternoon, as mail ballots were slowly counted, Oz led McCormick by about 1,200 votes, less than a tenth of a percent. “Trump’s endorsement of Mastriano backfired on Oz. There was retaliation. I was surprised by how many people said I’m not voting for anyone Trump endorsed,” Marino said. “They’ve had it with him. They were surprised with just how disloyal he was to Lou.”",Politics/NBC News,Trump leaves Pennsylvania GOP fuming over 'cockamamie election.'

5/20/2022,"DENVER (AP) — Colorado’s Supreme Court has ruled in favor of a woman who expected to pay about $1,300 for spinal fusion surgery but was billed more than $300,000 by a suburban Denver hospital that included charges it never disclosed she might be liable for. This week’s ruling in favor of Lisa French, who underwent two surgeries in 2014, follows efforts by many U.S. states and the federal government to help curb health care costs by restricting or eliminating so-called “surprise billing ” and requiring increased price transparency for consumers. In a unanimous opinion, the Colorado justices ruled Monday that agreements French signed before surgery at St. Anthony North Health Campus in Westminster don’t compel her to pay the extra charges, which stemmed from a then-secret list of prices for services that hadn't been disclosed to her. French had expected to pay $1,337 out of pocket after her medical insurance covered the rest, believing St. Anthony’s was an in-network provider. But a hospital employee provided her an incorrect estimate after apparently misreading her insurance card; in fact, the hospital wasn’t in-network, The Denver Post reported. French’s bill was $303,709. Her insurance paid roughly $74,000 of that amount. Centura Health, which operates the nonprofit hospital, sued for the balance. Attorneys for Centura Health argued the agreements French signed specified she was required to pay “all charges of the Hospital” — including the prices for services the hospital maintained internally at the time. But the court ruled that French never agreed to those charges since they weren’t specifically mentioned in the contracts. The justices also declared that an internal database of such prices, referred to as “chargemaster” rates, don’t reflect actual care costs because insurance companies often negotiate a lowering of prices to “in-network” rates. Justice Richard Gabriel, writing for the court, further asserted that internal hospital chargemaster rates “have become increasingly arbitrary and, over time, have lost any direct connection to hospitals’ actual costs, reflecting, instead, inflated rates set to produce a targeted amount of profit for the hospitals after factoring in discounts negotiated with private and governmental insurers.” The drawn-out case first went to a civil trial, which found French owed Centura Health only an extra $767. An appeals court later ruled for Centura, finding that hospitals can’t predict exact care costs in advance and that the term “all the charges” included in the contract obligated French to pay to full amount charged her. “This should be the end of the line for her,” Ted Lavender, an attorney for French, told the Post after the Supreme Court ruling, adding French was “very happy with the result.” A spokesperson for Centura Health didn't immediately respond to telephone and email messages Thursday seeking comment. In recent years, Colorado, California, New York, Oregon and other states have enacted laws designed to restrict or ban surprise hospital billing. A federal law, dubbed the “No Surprises Act,” went into effect Jan. 1 providing consumer protections against the practice.",U.S./Associated Press,"Court tosses $300,000 hospital bill for promised $1,300 tab",https://news.yahoo.com/court-tosses-300-000-hospital-182356073.html
