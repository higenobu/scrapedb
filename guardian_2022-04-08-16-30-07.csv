4/8/2022,"My girlfriend cranks the heating up year-round. It’s expensive, unnecessary and bad for the planet My girlfriend Hannah and I have lived together since September last year. Our home is a modern two-bedroom flat, so it retains its heat quite well and is very energy efficient. But we constantly disagree over what temperature to keep our home. I prefer a cooler temperature in the house – I like it to be around 20C in the winter, but Hannah prefers it a few degrees higher. But if you’re too cold, it’s better to wear a jumper around the house rather than immediately reaching for the thermostat. I like to be able to move around the house without feeling too hot. There’s also the environmental aspect to consider. We all know by now that overheating our homes isn’t good for the planet. Before we moved in together, Hannah lived in old student houses that were really cold so I think she craved a cosy home. She also grew up in the Middle East so she’s not used to British winters. When we got our own place, I wanted to set boundaries around the heating by ensuring that we keep it at an agreed temperature. But, on a few occasions, I’ve come home from work and found the flat roasting. Hannah gets home before me and the first thing she does is crank up the temperature. I’ve come back and seen it at 26C. I’m like: “What’s all this then?” Hannah will claim she’s only had it at that level for a short amount of time. My parents were very strict about heating. My dad had a silly rule: “No heating until November.” And even then it was set low, to 18C. We never had it on in summer. I’ve always lived in a cold house. Now it is getting warmer, but we’re still keeping the flat at 22C – that’s a compromise between 20C (too cold for Hannah) and 24C (too hot for me). Hannah wants me to consider turning up the heating in summer if she’s chilly. But in my opinion it’s usually unnecessary to have it on unless it’s unusually cold. Also, energy bills are increasing rapidly. I don’t want a shock bill next winter, because I don’t want to financially compromise in other areas of our life. Women feel the cold more, and I want my home to be cosy. Wearing layers indoors is just annoying I’m used to being warm. I was raised in the Middle East and I moved to England when I was 10 and found it hard to adjust to the climate. My family home was always really warm. It’s nice to come home to a cosy house when you have to deal with the cold at work (I’m a scientist in a lab) and outside. I usually keep the flat at 22C, but I occasionally turn it up if I’m a bit cold. I don’t think that you should wear more layers at home, it’s annoying and uncomfortable having loads of clothes on. At home you should feel free. It’s not more environmentally friendly because wearing more clothes means you have to wash them more regularly. This is also a gender thing; women are naturally colder and office temperatures are often tailored to men. In my lab, I wear jumpers and a lab coat when I’m working. Steven acknowledges that he grew up in a cold house and that it wasn’t good. I think he should be more flexible about heating in our house. He shouldn’t get so hung up on the number of the thermostat – he has this thing that if we make the house warmer than 22C he can’t be comfortable. I think it’s in his head a little bit. I do sometimes turn the heating up to 26C in winter before Steven comes back from work. If I get caught I say: “It was just on for a bit and I’m going to turn it down again when I warm up.” Having the heating on low overnight bothers me less because the duvet keeps me warm. I do want the heating on in the summer. Summer weather in the UK is inconsistent so I can feel cold at times. Ideally, I’d turn the heating on most nights before bed, or when temperature drops below 15C – which still happens a lot in warmer months here. Having the heating on all year around is optimum for me. If one person is really warm or cold, we should both be open to adjusting the temperature accordingly. It depends who feels most strongly about it at the time. I appreciate that our gas bills will be expensive with the price rising, but it’s a necessity. I’d rather compromise in other areas to keep the heating on. Should Hannah turn the heating down? Hannah needs to get real and layer up! Energy prices are going through the roof and Steven has already compromised enough. My daughter-in-law is from Brazil, but she is willing to put up with our chilly house.Pennie, 64 Hannah is guilty on multiple counts – environmental, financial, mathematical. I empathise gender-wise, but applaud Steven’s sensibilities. Maybe Hannah can use the scientific method to devise a greenhouse effect in one room? Anyway, deft layering won’t warrant extra laundry.Nyasha, 20 Ah, the perennial battle of the sexes – poor cold-blooded Hannah! But loungewear nowadays is light and comfortable. A zipper top over a T-shirt plus slipper socks should solve the issue if they agree to a truce of 20-22C – and help with the environment and crippling bills.Alan, 50 What a waste of both money and gas when all Hannah needs to do is put on a vest and a jumper. The argument about more washing just doesn’t, well, wash! You can rewear indoor clothes for ages.Kendra, 49 We all know it’s no fun feeling cold but given where we are now with soaring energy prices and the climate crisis, it’s hard to have much sympathy for Hannah. To some extent this is a cultural/climatic divide, so maybe Steven needs to introduce Hannah to some British traditions like long johns and the good old hot water bottle.Dominic, 38 So now you can be the judge, click on the poll below and tell us: should Hannah turn the heating down?

4/8/2022,"Although they became extinct 66m years ago, dinosaurs are always news. The latest manifestation of that is the media shower generated by the discovery of the perfectly preserved leg, including remnants of skin, of a dinosaur in North Dakota. It is suggested that this dinosaur, discovered at the Tanis fossil site, died on the very day the asteroid that caused the mass extinction of all the dinosaurs struck the Earth. It sounds almost too good to be true, but should make for a fascinating TV documentary next week, Dinosaurs: The Final Days, presented by Sir David Attenborough, naturally. There are probably more palaeontologists working on dinosaurs today than at any point in history, and we have perhaps learned more about these incredible ancient reptiles in the past 20 years than in the previous 200. Plenty of once controversial and speculative ideas have been confirmed by the discovery of important fossils and diligent research on them. Dinosaurs were warm, active animals; some were intelligent and lived in groups; and they gave rise to birds, which are living dinosaurs. These ideas have echoed in research for decades and have been mainstream from the 1990s onwards, but they act as a starting point for what has come since. We now have hundreds of specimens of dinosaurs, representing dozens of species, that are preserved with fossilised feathers. Moreover, we can track the evolution of feathers and their change from simple filaments to flight-capable aerofoils. We have also discovered microscopic structures called melanosomes that in part give feathers and skin their colours, and allow palaeontologists to begin to reconstruct the colours and patterns of these animals. That’s an astounding change in our ability to produce information from the fossil record and opens up enormous future possibilities for research. Reconstructing the colour of a single individual, however impressive and interesting, is only of limited scientific value. We might be able to tell that it had a pattern that would work as camouflage, for example, or instead had very bright patterns that were likely for display, but it can’t tell the whole story. Males and females were likely to have had different colours in many species, and birds moult their feathers, so bright breeding colours might only be around for part of the year or white winter coats might appear in others. Juveniles might be different colours from adults, and there could be regional variations, or things might evolve and change over time. All of these are reasonable possibilities and are the kinds of things that scientists can now assess. There’s huge future potential for a massive expansion in our understanding of dinosaur colours and signals. This can also be integrated with other finds. In 2016, a paper was published describing bizarre pairs of scrapes dug into the ground that were made by large, carnivorous (and at least possibly feathered) dinosaurs. They looked as if an animal had almost pawed at the ground and excavated a furrow with each foot, and there were lots of pairs. There was no indication that they might have been digging for food or water, and they didn’t look like any known nest and would hardly work well as one. What they do resemble, though, are scrapes left in the ground by several different groups of modern seabirds during courtship rituals. This was, in fact, evidence of dinosaur displays and courtship. It’s a fascinating find and some great deductive work went into eliminating the possible explanations to leave this as the most likely one. However, while it provides extraordinary information about how at least one dinosaur was trying to find a mate, it leaves far more questions unanswered. Telling dinosaurs apart from their tracks is not easy, and “large carnivorous dinosaur” is about as close as it gets. It would be wonderful to say it was a tyrannosaur, where we have some ideas about their social interactions (they fought each other, a lot), but we don’t actually know, and it is all but impossible to find out. We also don’t know what else they might have been doing in addition to making the scrapes. There would very likely have been various other rituals going on, bobbing or bowing like geese and albatrosses, for example, calls between couples, all kinds of possible dances or other moves, and feathers (if present) could have been fluffed up and shaken. Did this go on for minutes or days? We not only don’t know, but it’s almost impossible to conceive how we could know. Thus, there are two distinctive and well-separated gaps in our knowledge of dinosaurs – the ones we are likely to fill and those that are almost impossible. The latter are numerous, but that doesn’t mean they are necessarily out of reach. Until only a few years ago I would have said that dinosaur colours were not only not known, but something we could never know, and that was true right up to the point that it wasn’t. When some enterprising researchers realised that melanosome shape was linked to colour and that melanosomes could be preserved, it opened up a whole new set of possibilities that we have only just begun to explore, and other “impossibilities” may one day fall. And, of course, the more conventional gaps will still be filled in. Palaeontologists continue to find fossils of new species, from new areas, and to be able to piece back together the evolutionary history of these most incredible reptiles though all the new data that is coming in. So for all the frustrating missing pieces that we have in the puzzle of dinosaur biology across the nearly 200m years that they were around, we have more than enough pieces to see what the true picture is, and more and more gaps are being filled. There are plenty that we’ll probably never find, but it won’t stop our knowledge from growing or our understanding improving, and the future of dinosaurs is a most rosy one.

4/8/2022,"Wesley So won the low-key final leg of the Fide Grand Prix in Berlin on Monday, but the US world No 7 missed out on what mattered to him most, qualification for June’s world title Candidates in Madrid. So and Hikaru Nakamura, who was already sure of overall Grand Prix victory and a Candidates place, made little effort in their two classical games. The second ended after just a few minutes play with what has become the standard tacitly agreed fast drawing sequence for top grandmaster chess, a Ruy Lopez Berlin Defence leading to threefold repetition. In the ensuing tiebreak rapid games, Nakamura blundered a piece and that was the end. The five-time US champion-turned-streamer with more than a million followers was probably more interested in the chess.com Arena Kings, Titled Tuesday and Rapid Chess Championship. The Rapid, staged every weekend, has within a few weeks become one of the most significant online events, rivalling the Meltwater Champions Tour that features on the rival website chess24.com. It is open to the top 100 world grandmasters, plus juniors and wildcards, and is backed by Coinbase with a $625,000 (£478,000) prize fund. Its format is a Swiss on Saturday with a 10+0 time limit, then a knockout on Sunday. After seven weeks play three of the four leaders are Americans – Fabiano Caruana, Levon Aronian and Nakamura – but six of the top nine are Russians, all playing without any flag. After completing his Berlin victory, So admitted that he had not played well enough to qualify for Madrid, and added: “I am only 28, and hoping that in the next couple of years I will get a chance to play in the Candidates … If you qualify, you have to be ready to fight for first place.” The moment that spoilt So’s chances came in speed tiebreaks in the first grand prix leg in Berlin, when So surprisingly lost to Leinier Dominguez, the world No 13. Had he won that mini-match, he would have at least tied with Hungary’s Richárd Rapport for a Candidates place. International opens with large entries were popular before the pandemic, and are now reviving. The European championship at Terme Catez, Slovenia, finished on Wednesday, the same day the Reykjavik Open began in Iceland, half a century after the iconic Bobby Fischer v Boris Spassky match. It was an occasion for a rare double success for English juniors. Shreyas Royal, 13, who missed an international master norm by only half a point in his previous tournament at Ilkley, Yorkshire, in February, maintained his high level by scoring 5.5/11 against opposition including four GMs and three IMs with a tournament performance of 2358, within 50 points of IM level. In his entertaining first round game against Baadur Jobava, the No 1 for Georgia and a former world top 20 GM, Royal had a winning material advantage before it slipped into a draw. In Wednesday’s opening round of Reykjavik, Sohum Lohia, 12, stood better against the Danish GM Mats Andersen when he accepted a draw offer at move 37. Lohia showed promise in opens in Spain before the pandemic, and has clearly matured further since. England’s youngest chess hopes, Kushal Jakhria and Bodhana Sivanandan, whose achievements were discussed in this column last month, face their next test when they compete in the European schools under-seven championships starting 20 April and the world under-eight rapid and blitz that begin on 1 May. The title contests are staged on the island of Rhodes. The English duo both had their seventh birthdays in March but still count as under-sevens for international competition. As the only Fide-rated players in the under-sevens bracket, they will be among the favourites, although there are entries from Azerbaijan which is traditionally strong in junior chess. The world under-eight rapid and blitz will be more competitive, and will include some Russian children, playing under a neutral Fide flag. There is a wider significance for English chess in these promising results. For more than 20 years, since Gawain Jones and David Howell emerged in the late-1990s and later developed into elite level grandmasters rated 2650-plus, there has been a 2500 achievement ceiling which new talents have failed to break, partly because they become involved too late in major competitions. The pattern has been for players to reach 2200 level, expert/master standard, in their early or middle teens, achieve international master norms (2400-2450) in their late teens, and only compete for grandmaster titles around 20, by which time university, career and family commitments take over. Now, for the first time this century, there seems the possibility of at least four talents who may be able to break through the 2500 barrier. Far too soon for hurrahs yet, but enough for a watching brief. 3810 1…f2+! 2 Kf1 Re1+! 3 Kxf2 Rf1+! 4 Kxf1, draw by stalemate. After 1…Rg2+? 2 Kf1! or 1…Re1+? 2 Kf2 Re2+ 3 Kf1!

4/8/2022,"Set in and around Lagos, Eloghosa Osunde’s raucous debut is dotted with glimpses of the city’s famous nightlife. At a party in the Old Ikoyi district, “[the] apartment was high out of its mind. The bodies inside were teeming with energy … They could turn the music down, but why? It was a good night to feel this alive. A great night to feel the beat in your thighs, in your stomach, in your chest, pounding through your veins. You can’t breathe, sure, but do you want to? This loud love, the rapid-fire desire, all of it is what resuscitates you after all, is what makes you want to love the world again.” Even when it confronts darkness in its condemnation of Nigeria’s political and religious corruption and homophobic legislation, Osunde’s partly magical realist novel is imbued with this rich sense of the kinetic and the possible. As intimated by the titular exclamation mark, it is a loud work. It boldly rails against the pernicious sexual orthodoxies and hypocrisies of Nigerian life. It also joyfully resists conventional formal boundaries, both linguistic and generic. Written in “standard” and pidgin English, adopting prosaic and poetic modes, Vagabonds! is a kind of queer phantasmagoria. It consists of short story-like snapshots about disfranchised dreamers and otherworldly beings living in Lagos’s thrall, all drawn with Osunde’s skill for foregrounding moments of quiet connection amid metropolitan cacophony. A celebrity seamstress who must hide her relationship with another woman gives birth to a preternaturally wise, shamanic daughter. A gay chauffeur is made horrifically aware of how dangerous it is for him to love. A group of abused wives create a safe space in which to share their trauma – and begin to disappear. A pair of sex workers find transcendental solace in their devotion to one another. A corrupt politician gets more than he bargained for – or perhaps his just deserts – in an encounter with an AI rent boy. The fantastical tone of the writing throughout serves to draw attention to the speciousness of othering whole groups of society. It also underscores the illusory nature of binary distinctions between “us” and “them”. Most movingly, it highlights how the experiences of persecution can make one feel strange to oneself. The thread that holds together these surreal and hyperreal sketches, not always effectively, is the character arc of Tatafo. Tatafo is a mercurial presence, one of the underlings of Lagos’s presiding spirit, Èkó. Tatafo is sent into the city to spy on its inhabitants. At the unjust Èkó’s command, Tatafo wreaks havoc, sustains inequality and stokes hunger for excess. But soon enough, Tatafo begins to question Èkó’s autocratic regime. He finds himself ejected from Èkó’s inner circle, full of questions and bent on change. While the mobility of the narrative shape makes Vagabonds! an energising read, there are moments when episodic similarities in tone, texture and content undermine the reader’s immersion in this bustling world. Underdogs, in their different guises, are always worthy of empathy. The powerful are unfailingly malevolent. Feelings are strongly felt. Especially at the beginning of the novel’s final act, as the tales become more compressed and fleeting, one might question the purpose of the narrative’s meandering structure. The slightly abrupt and unexpected conclusion – an imagined reckoning between the city’s elites and armies of the dispossessed – offers some answers, and uplifting hope too. But it is a long and wiggling route towards this culmination. Overwhelmingly, what readers will be struck by is the powerful sense of freshness, newness and aliveness here. Osunde gives readers a visionary version of what Lagos is and what it could be. Reverberating with musicality and shot through with innovative figurative language, this patchworked, fabulist novel messily and mischievously appeals for a freer and more open Nigeria. In its experimental celebration of individuality, Vagabonds! is always defiantly and resolutely itself.  Vagabonds! is published by 4th Estate (£14.99).
