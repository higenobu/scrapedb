2/9/2022,"Aviral open letter from a member of Facebook group, HK Moms, marked something of a shift in public opinion. The group is the type not usually preoccupied with the city’s political upheavals, but the letter revealed a limit had been reached. Addressing Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, it accused the government of holding its citizens hostage with new Covid measures – the toughest restrictions since June 2020.  “You have tried for two years, and failed. When will you stop holding the citizen of this once Asia’s city hostage? When does the goalpost stop moving further and further away every time we get closer? When do we say enough is enough Carrie Lam?” When HK Moms wrote an open letter to #hk #carrielam pic.twitter.com/GHoTJNgr48 On Wednesday leaks to the media, which had become semi-regular, claimed authorities were set to announce a third consecutive record day, with 1,161 new confirmed cases and about 800 preliminary positives. The figure doubled Tuesday’s, which in turn had doubled Sunday’s. In response, from Thursday Hongkongers will be subject to intense social restrictions including limits of two people gathering in public, or two households in private. There were some exemptions for carers and tradespeople, but the city was warned that authorities have strong contact tracing mechanism, and would be watching. The government also added religious premises, shopping malls, department stores, supermarkets, markets and barbers or hair salons to the forthcoming compulsory vaccine pass system, and doubled the financial penalties for non-compliance with compulsory testing orders. Hair salons and religious venues will be shut for at least two weeks. Photos on social media showed queues out the door of one barber. “We are now facing the most dire situation,” Lam said on Tuesday. “We have seen a surge in the number of confirmed cases and some are worried the real number would be beyond thousands each day.” The new rules add to existing measures which has already seen much of Hong Kong largely shut down, just as other countries – including those which had also once chased zero-Covid – begin to open. It also coincides with city-wide food shortages related to border closures and Covid cases among truck drivers who bring produce in from China to the import-dependant market, leading to stressful scenes, shop closures, and inflated prices. On Tuesday Lam conceded people felt the strategy known as “dynamic zero” came at a “great economic and social price”. “But I would like to make it clear, people’s lives and health, and for the local medical system not to collapse, these are more in line with Hong Kong’s public interest.” Hong Kong’s battle with Covid has been more successful than many other nations – it has recorded about 16,600 cases and 213 deaths – containing several major waves of outbreak and often bringing the number down to zero. But the tough methods have also drawn extensive complaints for frequent changes to unnecessarily convoluted rules, sudden blanket travel bans, occasional bouts of illogicality or farce like the closure of beaches or the mass cull of pet hamsters, and instances of failure or incompetence, like the overwhelming of the Penny’s Bay quarantine facility. The fact that this all kept continuing even as vaccination rates increased, treatments improved, and the world began to reopen to itself began to grate. “We have done all you ask,” the HK Moms letter said. “We sat quietly as mental health takes a toll, as families are torn apart and as businesses close down because it is all in the hope of China reopening our borders,” it said. Reopening borders to mainland China has community support, according to recent polling. But Beijing will not give the go-ahead unless Hong Kong can reach and maintain zero-Covid. Despite rising public anger, Lam is sticking to dynamic zero, a containment strategy with the constant goal of reaching zero cases. Health experts have said the method, of quickly controlling outbreaks and then relaxing once it’s done, is uncontroversial as long as it works. “The zero-phase is not too bad apart from for people who have to travel,” said Prof Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, said. “The problem is if Hong Kong can’t sustain zero Covid what’s going to happen. If this outbreak gets bigger and bigger, what’s next? That could take a long time and there are costs in those measures.”",News/World news,"As Hong Kong tightens Covid restrictions again, residents complain of being held ‘hostage’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/as-hong-kong-tightens-covid-restrictions-again-residents-complain-of-being-held-hostage
2/9/2022,"Nurses across New South Wales have overwhelmingly voted to walk off the job amid growing anger at staffing levels in the state’s hospitals, with more than 97% supporting a motion to hold the first statewide strike in almost a decade when NSW parliament resumes next Tuesday. The industrial action – the largest by nurses across NSW since 2013 – will come just days after the resumption of non-urgent elective surgery, which had been paused to free up staff during the Omicron wave.  While a minority of the more than 200 branches of the NSW Nurses and Midwives Association had yet to vote on Wednesday, the union’s general secretary, Brett Holmes, told Guardian Australia about 97% of the more than 10,000 nurses who had voted on the motion so far were in favour of the strike action. “Frankly, our members are very conscious that in November the premier made a decision to proceed with opening up no matter what,” he said. “He kept saying our health system was passing the test and our members were saying no, it’s not. He caused untold levels of anger among our members by telling people that it was all OK and going well. From our members’ perspective, that was so disrespectful and so tin-eared to what was really happening in our health system.” The decision of thousands of nurses to strike next Tuesday comes as part of a long-running call for the government to introduce minimum staff-to-patient ratios like those in Victoria and Queensland. They have also called for an increase in salaries above the 2.5% wage cap introduced by the NSW government several years ago, in response to the burden placed on staff during the Covid-19 pandemic. Holmes said while nurses would retain “life-preserving care” in hospitals, some non-urgent elective surgery could be delayed by the strike. “Hospitals have already had to cope with thousands of nurses in Covid-19 isolation so, you know, it’s not exactly outside of their current experience,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While different union branches have voted for different actions, some of Sydney’s major hospitals have voted for extended walk outs. Westmead hospital staff voted to walk out for 12 hours while staff in Blacktown, in the city’s west, plan to leave their jobs for eight hours. On Wednesday, Royal Prince Alfred hospital staff voted to take “up to” 24 hours’ action but have yet to decide how long to stay off the job. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, dismissed calls for staffing ratios similar to the policies in place in Victoria and Queensland. “The advice that I’ve received is that there are substantive challenges to that and it hasn’t actually worked so well in other states,” he said. He said he would support nurses’ rights to industrial action but did not want to see a year of rolling strikes. “What I want is reasonable, robust discussions to get outcomes. Let’s not play politics. We don’t want to get back to the old union games.” The NSW opposition leader, Chris Minns, called on the state government to give a Victorian government-style surge allowance boost to nurses, who he described as the “heroes of the pandemic”. “It’s a payment that would go directly to nurses, paramedics, doctors, those who worked in the allied health professions in our public hospitals [who] have done it very tough over the last seven to eight weeks,” he said. “It would go some way to showing our nurses and our frontline workers how much we appreciate them, how much we know they put on the line.”",News/Australia news,"NSW nurses vote in favour of statewide strike, citing premier’s ‘tin-eared’ response to Omicron",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/nsw-nurses-vote-in-favour-of-statewide-strike-citing-premiers-tin-eared-response-to-omicron
2/9/2022,"The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has questioned the need for the federal government’s religious discrimination bill, saying the proposed laws could cause more problems than they solve. Perrottet’s comments came a day after Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, revealed his government was already seeking legal advice on how to ensure existing state laws would be protected if the federal bill passed into law.  If passed, the federal legislation would override existing anti-discrimination legislation in all eight states and territories. Federal Labor on Wednesday agreed to move substantial amendments to the government’s bill and but pass it in the lower house, setting up a potential Senate standoff over the protection of LGBTQ+ students and statements of belief months out from the federal election. Asked at a press conference if religious schools should be allowed to expel transgender students, Perrottet said he did not see why the federal government’s bill was needed. “I’ve made it very clear that I don’t believe legislation in this space is necessary and I think it can end up creating more problems than it [solves],” he said on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Andrews said he agreed with moderate federal Liberal MP Bridget Archer, who has said she would vote against the bill. “She spoke about the fact that she was very concerned about arrangements in Canberra overriding state law – that didn’t make any sense to her,” Andrews said. “I absolutely agree. We made election commitments. We’re just delivering the things that Victorians voted for. And that’s what’s been important to me. And we will always fight to do that.” Last year, Victoria’s parliament passed the equal opportunity (religious exceptions) amendment bill, which prevented government-funded religious bodies from refusing services to people based on their sexual preference or gender. The law also banned religious schools from sacking or refusing to hire staff based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, although an exception remained for when it was critical to the job in question, such as the hiring of a religious studies teacher. Liam Elphick, a discrimination law expert at Monash University, said the government’s legislation, if passed as it currently stands, would be the first time in 50 years that a federal law has explicitly weakened state and territory discrimination protections. He said the legislation included two provisions – clauses 11 and 12 – that could be used as federal defences to trump anti-discrimination legislation in all eight state and territories. “The statement of belief override would grant people of faith a positive right to discriminate, eroding existing protections for women, LGBTIQ+ people, people with disabilities, and those of minority faiths,” he said. “The religious schools override would reverse new laws in Victoria that provide strong protection for teachers and staff, allowing religion to be used as a guise to discriminate against them.” Wednesday’s comments were not the first time Perrottet – a proud Catholic who has in the past voted against decriminalising abortion – has questioned the motivations behind the religious freedoms bill. Appearing on Sky News after the bill was introduced to federal parliament in November, the NSW premier said governments should refrain from attempting to legislate “freedom”. “We haven’t needed it for over a hundred years, why now?” he said.",News/Australia news,Dominic Perrottet says religious discrimination bill may ‘create more problems’ than it solves,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/dominic-perrottet-says-religious-discrimination-bill-may-create-more-problems-than-it-solves
2/9/2022,"Almost a third of bus services in England could be axed within weeks if the government does not make “critical decisions” to extend emergency funding, bus operators have warned. Bus services were supported by grants during the pandemic when customers were advised to avoid unnecessary travel, but funding is due to expire on 5 April, with passenger numbers still only about 70% of pre-pandemic levels.  Operators normally have to give a minimum six weeks’ notice of route closures, meaning that many are already having to decide which will not be viable in the spring, when the Bus Recovery Grant payments end. The Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents the industry, said it expected to have a £350m “funding gap” next year, with operators also facing higher costs, especially in staffing, where a driver shortage has led to large wage increases. Graham Vidler, chief executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, told a House of Lords committee hearing on Tuesday: “The consequences could be that bus operators are forced to reduce services by about 30%. “The decisions that government makes in the coming weeks are really critical. If they are to provide a short-term, limited extension of the grant, it will allow the industry to recover. “If the government steps away, not only will it undermine the ambitions set out in the national bus strategy, but in future to stay on track to achieve net zero they are going to have to rebuild those bus services again which will cost more money and be harder to attract passengers who have formed new habits.” Phil Southall, managing director of the Oxford Bus Company, told the hearing that numbers had been recovering after the pandemic, but added: “The ‘avoid public transport’ messaging has left a legacy.” Southall said that while the government had promised a £3bn investment in buses through funding for regional improvement plans, which would become available to councils and the industry from October, there was now £1.2bn available and the funding was oversubscribed. “At the moment we have this gap, where we’ve got a bit of a cliff-edge, potentially looking at service reductions, which we’re trying to do everything we can to avoid,” he said. “We need that extra time to generate the patronage back.” In private, other operators were more blunt. One, who requested not to be named, said companies had faced long delays in receiving promised Covid payments from the Department for Transport, adding: “The policy and administration is in chaos. Trust in the DfT is extremely low. The bus sector is hurtling towards disaster.” The driver shortage, which intensified during the latest Omicron wave of the pandemic, was already affecting many bus services with frequent cancellations. But operators have warned that the financial situation is likely to mean more widespread route closures – in rural areas and also cities where cash-strapped urban transport authorities have to fund fixed-cost transit systems such as the Tyne and Wear Metro. The operator Go-Ahead has revealed initial cuts to routes, some serving deprived communities on the edge of Newcastle and north Tyneside. South Yorkshire’s mayor, Dan Jarvis, on Tuesday wrote to bus operators First and Stagecoach to appeal to them to reconsider planned cuts to services and fare increases, which he said was “strategic shortsightedness of the worst kind”. However, he said he recognised the “genuine pressures” facing the industry, adding: “The government’s failure so far to extend Covid support for bus services is utterly reckless.” A DfT spokesperson said: “The government has provided unprecedented support to over 160 operators to keep services running during the pandemic, and we’re working closely with the sector to understand the potential challenges and possible mitigations once it ends in April.” The spokesperson said that more than 90% of recovery grant payments had been processed and the department had paid out more than £186.6m in Covid-related support to the sector between November and January.",News/World news,Bus operators in England plead for cash saying third of services face axe,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/bus-operators-england-plead-cash-services-face-axe
2/9/2022,"Three Iranian refugees are facing deportation from Turkey after taking part in a demonstration against Ankara’s withdrawal from the Istanbul convention on violence against women. Lily Faraji, Zeinab Sahafi and Ismail Fattahi were arrested after attending a protest in the southern Turkish city of Denizli last March. A fourth Iranian national, Mohammad Pourakbari, was detained with the others, despite not attending the protests, according to Buse Bergamalı, their lawyer.  Hundreds of protesters across Turkey have faced brutal responses from local police for participating in demonstrations against Turkey’s withdrawal from the convention, which aims to combat violence against women by supporting survivors of abuse. “They were taken from their homes because they joined in the Istanbul convention protests,” said Bergamalı, adding that the four were arrested after police photographed them at the protests and identified them. The four were later charged with “disturbing public order”, and “participating in unlawful demonstrations”. Turkish authorities ruled earlier this month that the group could be deported, after they lost their appeal against a deportation order issued last April. Bergamalı said three of the group had been granted conditional refugee status, making it illegal to return them to Iran. “However, there is no indication in the court decision that these people cannot be sent back to Iran,” she added. The order to deport the group comes amid rising concern over Turkey’s treatment of Iranian dissidents and asylum seekers in Turkey, who number at least 24,300, according to the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR). An estimated 67,000 Iranian citizens live in Turkey, with numbers reportedly rising in recent years as some flee persecution while others look to avoid US sanctions on Iran by buying property and claiming Turkish citizenship. Bergamalı said the four Iranians she represents have been fighting to remain in Turkey, even as conditions for Iranian citizens worsen. “They are fighting for their lives,” she said. “They came to Turkey to survive. They’re trying to stay here so as not to die.” Iranian dissidents in Turkey have increasingly raised the alarm that they are no longer safe in a country formerly regarded as a safe haven. In 2020, an Iranian feminist activist, Maryam Shariatmadari, was briefly detained by police in Denizli, after fleeing Iran two years earlier after protesting against being forced to wear a hijab. Turkish authorities initially said Shariatmadari had been arrested because her visa had expired and she could be deported to Iran, where rights groups said she faced torture or even the death penalty. After a public outcry, Shariatmadari was allowed to renew her Turkish visa and released. Eleven Iranian citizens, including a former employee of the Iranian consulate in Istanbul, are on trial for involvement in the murder of Masoud Molavi Vardanjani, an Iranian dissident in Turkey known for his social media posts criticising corruption within the Islamic Republic.

2/9/2022,"The number of UK households classed as destitute could rise by nearly a third to more than 1 million this spring after the government adds an increase in national insurance to the wider cost of living squeeze, a thinktank has warned. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) urged ministers to reconsider the tax increase after it said destitution – which it defines as an inability to buy basic essentials – could increase by 30% in the next financial year if households are faced with a combination of rising inflation, higher bills and a greater tax burden.  In a report that accused the government of “powering down, not levelling up”, the thinktank said cost-of-living pressures were hitting the lowest-income households hardest, as they spend a greater proportion of their income on food and fuel. It pointed out that those households were “heavily concentrated in some of the most economically deprived areas of the country, including parts of the north-west, Wales and pockets in London and the south-east”. The NIESR said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, should also increase government spending in his forthcoming budget to boost investment and allow public services to cope with higher inflation, leaving the Bank of England greater scope to tackle rising prices by increasing interest rates. Jagjit Chadha, the NIESR director, accused the government of prematurely withdrawing its Covid-19 support measures, arguing that it limited the central bank’s ability to tackle rising prices. He said Bank officials were forced to maintain ultra-low interest rates to prevent bankruptcies and hardship among poorer households when financial protection should be the Treasury’s job. “The government has chosen to tighten primarily through fiscal policy, leaving monetary policy lagging the inflation cycle. This policy sequencing is the wrong way round,” he said. Sunak is due to present new budget forecasts to parliament on 23 March. The NIESR kept its growth forecasts largely unchanged from its last projections in November but revised up the outlook for inflation, which it expects to peak at 7% in the three months to June before returning to its 2% target in 2024. Last week the Bank raised its main interest rate to 0.5% in the first back-to-back rate rise since 2004 and signalled further increases this year to above 1%. The NIESR said it expected Britain’s economy to grow by 4.8% this year – stronger than the 3.75% forecast by the Bank last week – before slowing to 1.3% in 2023 and 0.9% in 2024. In a blow to the Treasury, the thinktank estimated that British economic output in 2025 would be 4% lower than forecast just before the Covid-19 pandemic. This estimate of the scarring to the economy is higher than the 1% estimated by the Bank, though lower than the 12% decline after the 2008 global financial crisis. The number of UK households living “in destitution” rose from 0.7% of all households in 2019 to 1.5% in 2020 – based on the income components of the widely recognised Joseph Rowntree Foundation definition of destitution. According to the JRF, destitution means going without the essentials individuals need “to eat, stay warm and dry, and keep clean”.",News/Business,"National insurance rise could mean 1m destitute households in UK, says thinktank",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/09/national-insurance-rise-could-mean-1m-destitute-households-in-uk-says-thinktank

When that came, in the shape of a low-flying peregrine, he and the rest of the flock hardly reacted.

2/9/2022,"Why are the most extreme Tory MPs so influential? The European Research Group pressed for the hardest of Brexits, and the government gave it what it wanted. A similar faction, the Covid Recovery Group, lobbied for the removal of public health measures, and again succeeded. Now the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, featuring some of the same characters, demands the abandonment of effective climate policy, and is clearly gaining ground. Why? Because the Conservative party has long been drawn towards its extremes. It is pulled this way by the gravitational force of dirty money. This is a result of the pollution paradox. The paradox proposes that the most antisocial commercial interests have the greatest incentive to buy political favour, otherwise they would be regulated out of existence. So politics comes to be dominated by them.  The Conservatives shamelessly court dirty money, and dirty money is ripping this country apart. It wants to tear away regulation and restraint. As politicians roll over, they expose us to repeated crises. Last month, the UK government overrode the Welsh government to permit the massive extension of a coalmine. This will produce 40m tonnes of coal: in other words, it’s almost 15 times bigger than the proposed new mine in Cumbria. Yet the media, perhaps because so many English journalists struggle to locate Wales on the map, has scarcely mentioned it. Also in January, the government approved a new oil and gas field called the Abigail. Last week, it overruled the local authority to force through an extension of Bristol airport. Far be it from me to accuse this upstanding administration of insincerity, but you could almost imagine that its commitments at the climate summit last November did not mean what they appeared to mean. The central claims of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group are nonsense. Energy bills are increasing not because of feeble green levies, but because the global price of fossil gas has boomed. On Tuesday, BP posted profits of £9.5bn. Last week, Shell announced that it had made £14.3bn. They are likely to rake in even more this year. In the middle of the climate summit in November, the chief executive of BP boasted that his company is “a cash machine”. This is what you are paying for when your bills rise. In the UK, these companies have been granted a licence to print money. For the past three years, Shell and BP have paid no corporation tax on the oil and gas they extract from the North Sea and no production levies either. In other words, they have been given these resources by the government. Whoops, I mean paid to take them away. Over the same period, they have been granted reliefs on the taxes they didn’t pay of almost £400m. This is because they can claim the cost of decommissioning their rigs and platforms against their nonexistent tax bills. But decommissioning should have been priced in when the contracts were signed. It’s a classic case of private profits, public liabilities. After being paid to take the gas away, these companies sell it back to us at mind-boggling prices. What is the best way of avoiding the ruinous costs of fossil gas? Insulating our homes and switching to new energy sources. As an analysis by Simon Evans at Carbon Brief shows, the scrapping of green policies by successive Tory governments has added almost £2.5bn to the UK’s energy bills. This expensive vandalism includes junking energy efficiency grants, banning new onshore windfarms and abandoning the zero carbon homes plan. A recent study shows that homes in the UK lose heat, on average, three times faster than homes in Germany. Part of the reason is that the number of homes installing cavity wall insulation fell by 97% after David Cameron scrapped the grant scheme. In a recent article in the Times, the chair of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group group, Craig Mackinlay MP, claimed that onshore wind power costs twice as much as gas and has been “rising steadily for the last decade”, while offshore wind costs three or four times as much. These claims are flat wrong. Government estimates show that gas costs twice as much as onshore wind power, and one and half times as much as offshore wind. Nor is this crisis, as some Tory MPs maintain, anything to do with a lack of domestic supply. As fuel bills soar, exports of gas from the UK have risen. Their claims to care about people struggling with rising energy bills look to me like blatant opportunism. The website They Work for You shows that the most prominent member of the group, Steve Baker MP, has consistently voted for a reduction in welfare payments. But as soon as the interests of fossil fuel companies are threatened he becomes Robin Hood. In an article in the Sun last year, owned by that lifelong champion of poor people, Rupert Murdoch, Baker lamented that green policies would “leave Britain’s poorest out in the cold”. He railed against the imposition of costs on working families by “elite policymakers who govern our lives”, of which he is the very model. If he really cares about costs being dumped on working families by elite policymakers, perhaps I could draw his attention to Brexit. Its price tag, according to one calculation, will by 2050 be 20 times greater than the cost of net zero. Yes, that Brexit, which Baker, as the former chairman of the European Research Group, was so determined to take all the way. Of course, the costs of decarbonisation should not be borne by the poor. But there is no need for them to be. A windfall tax on the profits of fossil fuel companies is just one of the simple and progressive measures that could pay for the refurbishment, insulation and new heating systems that so many homes desperately need. But guess whose political philosophy forbids such distributions of wealth.

2/9/2022,"The stereotype about Los Angeles sports fans is that they only love their teams when they’re winning. For decades, this hasn’t been much of a football town.  “It was never cool to be a Rams fan growing up in LA,” said Ryan Nixon, 40. “It was like this safe team your grandparents liked to watch.” The Rams only had one winning season as Nixon was a kid, and then the team decamped to the other side of the country. This week, they have a chance to once again win over the city that loves winners, with a story so corny it could be nominated for an Oscar. The Rams are back in their old hometown after a long and dramatic absence, one that was prolonged for years by the machinations of rival team owners. But even after the team moved back to the city from St Louis in 2016, there was plenty of skepticism about what it would take to make the city care much about its football franchise. A whole generation of local kids younger than Nixon had grown up without any hometown allegiance, as the Rams played, increasingly poorly, in St Louis. The city had done without an NFL team for 20 years, and there were superstar basketball players, a beloved baseball team and high-quality college football to keep Angelenos’ loyalties tied up. Did it really need the NFL? Some old-school Rams fans never forgave the team for its departure. ‘When they moved, that was my first experience with the whole ugly side of sports, the strictly-business, money-dominates-everthing-else of sports,” said Ryan Jones, a basketball writer who grew up in Orange county. “That there were LA fans that stuck with them was wild to me. Why would you have a sense of loyalty to a team that essentially abandoned you as a fan?” But other original Los Angeles Rams fans kept their faith, even during the team’s long 20 years wandering in an NFL desert. “I think Rams fans are very emotional fans. All football fans are emotional, but you have to have an emotional attachment to this team because of the fact that they’ve moved and the fact that you’re always taking some type of berating from other fans,” said Christian Duguay, 52, who provided a photograph of himself in Rams gear at around age five as proof of his longstanding commitment. Many longtime Rams fans inherited their allegiance to the team from their families, and stayed loyal, even in the absence of regular wins, even when the team left the city. As a kid, “I cried when my team lost, so I cried a lot of times,” said Manuel De La Rosa, who grew up in suburban east Los Angeles in the 70s, the son of even-more-original Rams fans, who had cheered on the team since it arrived from Cleveland in the late 1940s. Michael Johnson, a Rams fan since the 70s, regularly saw groups demonstrating with “Bring Back the Los Angeles Rams” signs and banners outside other Los Angeles sporting events by 2012 or 2013. “I was very enthusiastic, very hopeful,” Johnson said. “In my heart of hearts, I really believed that one day they would come back.” By January 2016, with the team’s potential return imminent, hundreds of Rams fans demonstrated outside the Coliseum stadium to demand the team’s return. “It was like a supermodel leaving you,” one mournful 70-year-old Rams fan told the Associated Press, describing the tragedy of the St Louis move. Sunday’s hometown game gives the Rams a chance to win the Super Bowl in a storyline that seems too good to be true. They’re led by a boy wonder coach, Sean McVay, who was 30 when he became the youngest head coach in NFL history. It’s their first season with fans allowed inside a palatial new stadium. The team’s new home – courtesy of their laconic billionaire owner, Stan Kroenke, also known as “Silent Stan,” that came with a price tag of more than $5bn. The team endured a Covid-19 outbreak in December, with as many as 29 players out of the game on the Covid-19 list at one time, ESPN reported. “If it was a Hollywood script it would get tossed out because no one would believe it,” the team’s chief operating officer, Kevin Demoff, told reporters last week. Demoff’s comments suggested the team owners felt the Rams were on the brink of “supersizing” their local fan base, the LA Times reported. But Demoff also sounded a note of caution: “We still have to go accomplish the last step for all of that to actually come to fruition.” “It’s weird to see that the Rams have become the cool LA team, and to see all the celebrities at the game. It’s weird to see everyone rooting for them,” Nixon said, especially for old-school fans like him who were “there in Anaheim in the 80s putting up with teams that were just terrible”. “I’m stoked for my little billion dollar team,” he added. “It’s just odd to see them embraced.” It’s not just that the Rams are winning more, Nixon said. It’s also that they’re providing fans with a more glamorous experience, including a stadium that the head of the Dallas Cowboys said last year needed to be so “ iconic” it was “like Mt Rushmore”. “LA is that town: it’s showtime,” Nixon said. “You want somewhere to go to be seen, to have a spectacle and to get a show, and I think with the new stadium they’ve done that.” Meanwhile, the role the Rams used to play of the Los Angeles NFL team few Angelenos care about, is being filled by the Los Angeles Chargers, who moved from San Diego in 2017 and share the Rams’ SoFi stadium as the decidedly less-popular team. As a former San Diego resident, “I know how strong the Chargers fandom is. I can’t imagine what they’re going through,” Nixon said. “I feel bad that they’re here,” Duguay said of the Chargers. “I think the Rams have a chance to really be a symbol of the city.” The Rams’ Hollywood storyline does come with a risk: if they lose after all the buildup, their rise to true Los Angeles popularity may slow down, though it won’t stop altogether. “I always tell people, when the Raiders had their first year in Los Angeles, they won the Super Bowl. That’s why you have so many Raiders fans [here],” De La Rosa said. For the Rams faithful, the potential thrill of a Rams win, in their home stadium, after decades of exile, is hard to overstate. “My son is getting married in two days,” Johnson said. “Short of that: the birth of my child, watching my son get married, or being married myself, I can’t imagine a bigger thrill in my life.”",News/US news,Will the LA Rams get their Hollywood ending?

2/9/2022,"Nearly one in five applicants to the white supremacist group Patriot Front claimed to hold current or former ties to the US military, according to leaked documents published and reviewed by the Southern Poverty Law Center and alternative media collective Unicorn Riot. Some 18 out of the 87 applicants, or 21%, said they were currently or previously affiliated with the military. One applicant, who claimed to be a former Marine, also said he currently worked for the Department of Homeland Security, according to the SPLC’s Hatewatch, a blog that tracks and exposes activities of American rightwing extremists.  A white supremacist and neo-fascist hate group, Patriot Front emerged as a rebrand of the neo-Nazi organization Vanguard America in the aftermath of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. According to the SPLC, the Patriot Front “represents one of the most prominent white supremacist groups in the country” and is led by Thomas Rousseau, a 23-year old man based in Dallas, Texas. “A nation within a nation is our goal. Our people face complete annihilation as our culture and heritage are attacked from all sides,” Rousseau once said. In January, Unicorn Riot published over 400 gigabytes of data that included “ostensibly private, unedited videos and direct messages [that] reveal a campaign to organize acts of hatred while indoctrinating teenagers into national socialism (Nazism),” the journalist collective said. Group members and applicants expressed an open admiration for Nazi ideologies, with the latter expressing various motivations for joining the group. One applicant, who said he lived in San Diego, claimed to be a current DHS employee and told Patriot Front he was inspired to join after he “found out about the Jews while in the marines”. Another applicant used derogatory language about LGBTQ+ people and said he “first saw” them during his time in the military. Someone else from Salt Lake City said he “shifted focus and questioned things” after his second deployment and went from being a Republican to joining the far right. Applicants also touted their various skill sets, including “great land-navigation, great physical fitness, able to clear rooms” and “basic medical training”. Others said they had been “trained in firearms”. One claimed to train people in “marine corps martial arts” and said he was the leader of the Kansas Active Club, an affiliate of the Rise Above Movement, a Southern California-based SPLC-designated hate group. In addition to alleged military affiliations, the leak also revealed that the group targets minors. According to Unicorn Riot, Patriot Front recruits “members through the internet who are still legally minors, indoctrinating them with white supremacist ideology and even encouraging them to lie to their parents so the group can transport them across state lines for fascist events”. Patriot Front’s official policies require members to be at least 17 and a half years old, but it “goes by a case by case basis” with certain members being below that age. In the past year, there has been growing concern surrounding the far-right radicalization of current and former military members. More than 80 defendants charged for their affiliation with the deadly January 6 riots have been found to have ties to the military, with most being veterans. Last March, the Pentagon released a report that cited domestic extremist groups posing an increasing threat to the military by attempting to recruit service members and in certain situations join the military to gain combat experience. “Military members are highly prized by these groups as they bring legitimacy to their causes and enhance their ability to carry out attacks,” the report said. “In addition to potential violence, white supremacy and white nationalism pose a threat to the good order and discipline within the military,” it added. In October, a House panel convened to discuss ways to address veterans being increasingly targeted for recruitment by extremist groups. “They provide them with a tribe, a simplistic view of the world and its problems, actionable solutions and a sense of purpose, and then they feed these vulnerable individuals a concoction of lies and an unrelenting narrative of political and social grievance,” retired Marine Lt Col Joe Plenzler said at the panel. A study last year by the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that in 2020, 6.4% of all domestic terror attacks and plots were committed by active-duty or reserve personnel, up from 1.5% in 2019 and none in 2018.",News/World news,Nearly one in five applicants to white supremacist group tied to US military,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/white-supremacist-group-patriot-front-one-in-five-applicants-tied-to-us-military
2/9/2022,"Boris Johnson was criticised for making arch-loyalist Mark Spencer leader of the House of Commons on Tuesday, despite claims he told former minister Nusrat Ghani her “Muslimness” had contributed to her sacking. Spencer was moved aside as chief whip in a mini-reshuffle as Johnson sought to restore discipline to his fractious party and reward Tory MPs who have helped him protect his position through the partygate scandal.  But as compensation, the longtime loyalist, who was involved in Johnson’s leadership campaign in 2019, was handed the prestigious title of leader of the Commons. Conservative whips under Spencer’s leadership have been implicated in threatening potential Tory rebels with funding cuts for their constituencies and with stories about their personal lives being fed to the media – tactics Conservative backbencher William Wragg has likened to “blackmail”. Ghani alleged last month that when she lost her job as a transport minister she was told that her “Muslimness” had been raised as a problem at a meeting in Downing Street. Spencer voluntarily identified himself as the person Ghani made the claims about, saying they were “completely false” and defamatory. His Labour shadow, Thangam Debbonaire, said the appointment was “completely inappropriate”, adding: “This is just the latest in a long line of appointments that demonstrates this government’s complete disregard for standards in politics.” Johnson’s shake-up also saw Jacob Rees-Mogg shifted from leader of the Commons to a new role of minister for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency – which allies said would be “very policy-heavy”. Tory rightwingers, including former Brexit minister Lord Frost, have been urging Johnson to push ahead with deregulation and other policies aimed at demonstrating the benefits of leaving the European Union. Senior backbencher Bernard Jenkin, chair of the House of Commons liaison committee, warned on Tuesday that his colleagues want Johnson to show evidence of significant change. “He’s got to sort this out. We’re interested not in the optics, in some impression of a reset, we’re looking for a change in the capability and the character of the government, so that we can have confidence that nothing as clumsy and mortifying as this ‘partygate’ episode could ever happen again,” he said. Chris Heaton-Harris, formerly Europe minister in the Foreign Office, takes over as chief whip from Spencer. Heaton-Harris was a key member of a parallel parliamentary organisation advising the prime minister amid his recent woes. Heaton-Harris was accused of “McCarthyite” behaviour when he was universities minister after writing to vice-chancellors to demand a list of tutors lecturing on Brexit. Stuart Andrew, who was deputy chief whip, is moved to be minister for housing in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Andrew becomes the 11th housing minister in 12 years, a continual churn that housing groups have argued means the sector is not properly considered by government. The changes come amid a wider shake-up of the team around Johnson, as the prime minister seeks to reassure mutinous Tory MPs worried about alleged lockdown-breaking parties that are being investigated by police. Last Thursday, four senior No 10 aides quit or were pushed out: Johnson’s longstanding policy chief, Munira Mirza; Dan Rosenfield, his chief of staff; Martin Reynolds, his principal private secretary; and his director of communications, Jack Doyle. While Mirza’s departure was a surprise – her resignation letter condemned Johnson for falsely linking Keir Starmer to the failure to prosecute Jimmy Savile – the other three had been tipped to leave amid the fallout from the party claims. Barclay will lead efforts to integrate his department with a new Office of the Prime Minister and liaise with backbenchers over areas such as future policy. In place of Doyle, Johnson appointed Guto Harri as director of communications, a role he held for Johnson when he was mayor of London. Mirza was swiftly replaced by Andrew Griffith, a former investment banker and Sky executive who entered parliament in 2019. The internal reshuffle has faced some criticism. Some Tory MPs from northern “red wall” areas were critical of Griffith, who represents a safe seat in West Sussex, being handed a role shaping new government ideas.",News/Politics,PM criticised for making Mark Spencer leader of the Commons,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/09/pm-criticised-for-making-mark-spencer-leader-of-the-commons
2/9/2022,"For so many years, I lived as if I didn’t have a body. Childhood abuse meant mine was a conquered land, a place that had been pillaged and vanquished from the very start. Thirteen years ago, I found out I had stage 3b/4 uterine cancer. I discovered it late and by the time I did a tumour the size of an avocado already occupied my uterus. It had busted through my colon. I did not know it or feel it.  This sent me off on a quest, travelling the world in search of answers, asking women everywhere: when did you leave your body? Who owns your body? What space is your body allowed to occupy? How has your body been hurt, changed or refused by the government, your job, the supreme court, white supremacy, climate catastrophe, poverty, police violence, settler colonialism, transphobia, imperialism, capitalism? Women’s bodies are forever under threat. On alert. Ducking. Crouching. Hiding. Making themselves smaller, less obvious. Waiting for the insult. Guarding against the unwanted touch. The grab. The punch. The rape. The murder. How does your body fight back? When does your body rest? Nurses are expected to sacrifice their bodies for those who refuse to wear masks. Restaurant workers are forced to take down their own masks, risking sickness and death, so the unmasked customer can decide if their face is pretty enough for a lousy tip. Californian farm workers’ bodies are assaulted so routinely, while harvesting fields, that they have nicknamed them field de calzón, or “field of panties”, because their underwear is ripped off them when they are raped. Black women’s bodies are shot by police in their beds, in their cars, for a traffic violation in front of their child, on a “wellness check”. The wrong body in the wrong house. Afterwards, even their stories and names are disappeared. Speak her body, say her name. The body of a girl child sold by her parents to an old man in Herat, Afghanistan, to keep her starving family alive. The body of another girl sold online for the price of a mobile phone, and another, sourced by a British socialite for her rich, sadistic boyfriend, who serves the child’s body to his luminous circle of the depraved. Women’s bodies, carrying the memories of trauma, predisposing them to cysts and tumours, bumps, lumps and sickness, long after the damage is done. Women’s bodies always serving, feeding, bathing, holding, carrying and nurturing other bodies, never having time to think about their own. Women’s bodies hated for their “perfection”, for their “imperfection”; hated for being too thin, too fat, too round, too flat. Hated because they can do all that and make you feel all that. But bodies are now remembering, reattaching, returning, becoming bodies for the first time. The burning from daddy’s unwanted fingers shoved inside at five now becoming word, becoming fire, the language of purpose, of power. Bare-breasted bodies in the streets pushing back against femicide. Indigenous women’s bodies on horseback and in kayaks, protesting over pipelines about to spill oil. Fist-raised bodies pressed up against rows of erupting police. Bodies rising: my body, my choice. Differently abled bodies occupying the corridors of Congress. Enraged bodies smashing the steel doors of a factory where their sister and brother workers needlessly died. Women’s bodies, unapologetically alive, freeing the beauty and birdsong inside, no longer captive or denied, but becoming one surging body, sweeping in other bodies as they rise.

2/9/2022,"Reddit and Twitter users in the UK could be required to submit details of their passport or credit card as part of the government’s proposed age verification rules for pornography. The two sites are among the few mainstream social networks that continue to host large quantities of explicit adult material. Ministers said that social networks “where a considerable quantity of pornographic material is accessible” will have to conform to the same age verification rules as other commercial pornography websites.  This could leave Twitter and Reddit facing a choice of either verifying which British users are over 18 or finding a way to remove adult material from their services in the UK. Neither site currently has substantive age checks to access adult material. Pornography has been increasingly pushed off mainstream social networks. Facebook and Instagram have strict bans on pornography, while Tumblr removed all adult material from its service in 2018. The proposed law will see individual British internet users required to hand over a form of identification – such as a passport, driving licence or credit card – to an age verification provider, which would then tell a website hosting porn that the user is over 18. Outlets that fail to prove they have robust age checks could be fined 10% of their global revenue by the media regulator Ofcom, or risk being blocked altogether by British internet service providers. According to industry sources, the big fear among major porn sites is what happens if they comply with the law but smaller sites remain online without age checks. Iain Corby of the industry group the Age Verification Providers Association said that if the policy was poorly enforced by Ofcom it could punish pornography websites that comply with the law. “You stop going to PornHub, then you go to XHamster, then you go to the next down the list. Whatever you think of those sites they do tend to have some standards. You are driving people to sketchier sites,” he said. The cost of age verification is about 15-20p a person for websites. The pseudonymous sex blogger Girl on the Net said that the proposals could impact smaller websites: “The government proposes this every few years or so and it’s always unworkable, affecting smaller producers while benefiting bigger players in the market.” Past industry estimates put the likely number of British online porn users at 20-25 million – around a third of the UK population. The idea of putting mandatory age checks on porn websites, in an attempt to make it more difficult for under-18s to access adult material, has been floating around UK government circles for almost a decade. It became Conservative policy in the run-up to the 2015 general election, but despite passing the relevant legislation the original proposals collapsed amid legislative oversights and issues around its implementation. Alastair Graham, the boss of age verification company AgeChecked, said that building trust with users about how their data is handled would be key to ensuring widespread take-up. “Our approach is to not know who our customers are. We want to do verification and confirm someone is old enough to get on to a site but we don’t create a database of people’s names and details on our platform,” he said. “Even more importantly, the adult sites have no access to that personal information. The goal is to recognise an individual without knowing who they are.” He argued the current system where it is easy for children to view pornography is no longer acceptable: “Currently we’re doing nothing. Doing something to protect children, if not all children, has to be better than where we are now. The internet was designed by adults for adults.”",News/Society,Reddit and Twitter users face age checks under UK porn law plans,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/09/reddit-and-twitter-users-face-age-checks-under-uk-porn-law-plans
2/9/2022,"BP is just the latest major oil company to provoke political outrage after reporting its highest profits since 2013, fuelled by a year of record-breaking energy market prices that are adding to the UK cost of living crisis. But the perception that BP has profiteered from the energy crisis has another dimension compared with similar accusations levelled against its peers.  The company’s decades-long ties to the Kremlin, and its stake in Russia’s state-backed oil firm Rosneft, has raised concerns that BP has benefited financially from its alliance with Russia even as western powers threaten sanctions in response to its actions on Ukraine’s border. BP owns almost a fifth of Rosneft, reflecting the company’s deep, and at times troubling, legacy ties to Russia. In BP’s latest set of annual results the state oil company contributed $2.7bn in underlying profit to BP’s bottom line last year, up from just $56m the year before, or just over 21% of its bumper $12.8bn profit for the year. BP is also continuing to benefit from Moscow’s political manoeuvres, which have helped to ramp up global energy prices in recent months. Under the leadership of former BP boss Bob Dudley, the oil firm set up a joint venture, TNK-BP, alongside a string of Russian oligarchs in 2003. It was dissolved 10 years later to form Rosneft, but not before Dudley was forced to flee Moscow in 2008 after an “orchestrated campaign of harassment” by Russian state agencies. BP has nonetheless retained a 19.75% stake in the business, which is now run by Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, as well as seats on the board. This is despite a series of diplomatic rows between Moscow and the west in recent years and threats of economic sanctions, over a range of flashpoints including Georgia, Crimea and eastern Ukraine. The ties have been tested on climate grounds too after BP set out some of the most ambitious decarbonisation targets of any major oil company, while admitting they will not extend to their Rosneft stake. BP chief executive Bernard Looney, the architect of its low-carbon ambitions, said on Thursday that the Rosneft alliance remains in place despite the fresh threat of sanctions against Russia by the EU and the US as the Kremlin flexes its military muscle on the border with Ukraine. Global oil prices climbed by more than 50% last year to highs of $86 a barrel in October, before surging to seven-year highs of over $93 a barrel earlier this week amid fears that Russian forces amassed on the border of its western neighbour may move ahead with an invasion despite warnings from western powers. The rising oil price is likely to put major fossil fuel companies on track for further bumper profits in the current financial quarter. They have also benefited from record gas market prices across Europe, which were ignited by a global gas squeeze and enflamed by a slowdown of Russian gas flows into Europe before winter as tensions with Kyiv began to mount. “Russia is a large member of the energy system,” Looney told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. “We avoid the politics, that serves us well in many countries around the world.” If sanctions were imposed on Russia then BP would comply, he added, “but for now, there is no change.” If Looney plans to avoid getting involved in politics, Russia’s energy industry may not be the easiest place to be in the year ahead.",News/Business,BP can thank Moscow for plenty of its jackpot profits,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/09/bp-can-thank-moscow-for-plenty-of-its-jackpot-profits
2/9/2022,"The actual Brit awards ceremony has changed its complexion over the years: from the old-guard backslapping of the 80s to the boozy chaos of the 90s and early 00s. Today’s offering is slickly professional – hipper than it once was, less tone-deaf when it comes to representation, but not a hair out of place to the point of seeming faintly uneventful, unless you count the sight of Anne-Marie falling over, or the sound of Ed Sheeran gamely attempting to turn Bad Habits into a metal anthem with the aid of Bring Me the Horizon: even the person in charge of the mute button for swearing had an easy night. There was a lot of talk from host Mo Gilligan about hedonistic behaviour, but not many actual signs of it. Nor did anyone attempt to say anything controversy-stirring or political. This year, the onus appeared to have shifted slightly again. In what was clearly an attempt to attract a younger audience – an audience that don’t watch music shows on television – there were categories voted for by fans via TikTok; elsewhere, there were “afterparties” starring tweenage favourite PinkPantheress on gaming platform Roblox and the unmissable opportunity to buy Brits-related NFTs.  But none of this seemed to alter the awards themselves. As usual, the winners were easy to predict. Adele won all but one of her categories, a turn of events you could have seen coming from a mile off given that her latest album, 30, became the biggest-selling album of 2021 in the US and the UK, and her single Easy on Me topped the charts in 27 countries. Olivia Rodrigo was US pop’s multi-platinum breakout star of 2021: clearly she wouldn’t go home empty-handed. Perhaps it was surprising that the relatively leftfield Wolf Alice walked off with best British group, but then again, their only competition came from rappers D-Block Europe; London Grammar’s most recent album underperformed; so did Coldplay’s, at least by Coldplay standards; Little Mix, meanwhile, are going “on hiatus” (ie splitting up). The TikTok voting system didn’t seem to change much either: anyone expecting the video-sharing platform’s youthful audience to turn things on their heads and bring to the Brits a raft of new stars hitherto unnoticed by anyone under the age of 21 was out of luck, or hadn’t accounted for the fact that the platform’s youthful audience could only vote for pre-selected nominees. Perhaps Sam Fender’s deserved win in the alt-rock category had something to do with his single Seventeen Going Under’s vast popularity on TikTok, where it soundtracks videos of users relating stories of overcoming abuse. But he would have won anyway: a powerful, working-class voice, willing to take genuine lyrical risks, his work is potent, moving and refreshing. Indeed, the fact that you could have guessed most of the winners in advance wasn’t a reflection on the quality of the winners. If there was something odd about Little Simz winning best new act 11 years after she released her first mixtape, her authentically show-stopping performance underlined that her fourth album, 2021’s Sometimes I Might Be Introvert, was one of last year’s highlights: the sight of her mum collecting the award with her was really moving. One of its producers was Inflo, who also worked on Adele’s 30, and his best producer gong is richly warranted. Sault, the publicity-shy musical collective he helms, have released a succession of fantastic albums that are high water marks for British soul music and among the best records released in any genre in recent years. (In another sign of a great producer, Adele credited him with changing her life “not just with my music, but with me as well”.) Nevertheless, it’s clear that the Brits is developing an issue keeping up with an increasingly fast-paced and divided pop world: there’s a noticeable disjuncture between what’s currently happening in the singles chart – dominated by a new wave of UK rappers and pop-dance hits – and what was on offer tonight. How it overcomes this and avoids the kind of slow slide into irrelevancy that dogged it during the late 80s remains to be seen.",Arts/Music,"Worthy winners aside, the Brits is struggling to keep pace with modern pop",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/09/worthy-winners-aside-the-brits-is-struggling-to-keep-pace-with-modern-pop
2/9/2022,"When Sue Gray pointed to dysfunction in Downing Street as one cause of the party culture that had developed in No 10 during the pandemic, Boris Johnson told MPs: “I get it, and I’ll fix it.” But Tuesday’s mini-reshuffle, promoting ultra-loyalist MPs who have battled to save the prime minister’s skin in recent days, and creating the post of “Brexit opportunities minister”, hardly gave the impression of a fresh start.  Taken together with allegations about the lobbying efforts of his new director of communications, Guto Harri, the shake-up has perpetuated the sense that Johnson values loyalty above all else – and takes at best a relaxed approach to propriety and “chumocracy” in government. All the moves at cabinet level involved middle-aged white men, causing the overhaul to be described as a “he-shuffle”. Mark Spencer, the widely criticised chief whip whose team has been accused of threatening to cut resources from rebels’ constituencies, will now be leader of the House of Commons – a role that involves overseeing aspects of the parliamentary standards system. The Conservative MP William Wragg has said whips’ alleged threats “would seem to constitute blackmail” and has discussed them with the Metropolitan police. Spencer has also been implicated in claims by the former transport minister Nusrat Ghani that she was told her “Muslimness” had been a problem after she was sacked in 2020. Spencer has admitted being the whip whose alleged comments Ghani was referring to – though has insisted he did not make them. A Cabinet Office investigation is under way but no terms of reference for it have been published. Far from Johnson sidelining Spencer while these contentious claims are examined, he has handed him a more public-facing role, speaking for the government once a week at the dispatch box, at business questions – a platform his predecessor, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has used to advance his views on a range of subjects in recent years. Michael Ellis, the paymaster general who has been willing to defend Johnson robustly in the Commons in recent weeks, received a promotion, taking on some Cabinet Office responsibilities as well. And Spencer will be replaced as chief whip by Chris Heaton-Harris, part of a core team of Johnson loyalists who have operated as a “shadow whipping” operation in recent days in an attempt to prevent 54 no-confidence letters being submitted by their increasingly restive colleagues. As Downing Street aides prepared for the reshuffle, they were forced to field questions about Harri’s lobbying efforts and past business activities – after he kicked off his tenure with the reassuring message that Johnson is “not a complete clown”. Minutes were leaked to the Sun showing Harri asking Johnson’s former chief of staff Edward Lister which departments he should “nudge” on behalf of the Chinese tech firm Huawei, which was eventually excluded from key parts of the UK’s telecoms network from 2020. Harri, like Lord Lister, worked with Johnson in city hall when he was London mayor. No 10 said all guidance was adhered to by government officials. Johnson has long been dogged by allegations of conflicts of interest, from taking his “friend” Jennifer Arcuri on trade missions when he was mayor, to soliciting the funding of the Tory donor David Brownlow for his costly refurbishment of the Downing Street flat. Johnson subsequently repaid the donation from his own pocket, but Brownlow secured a meeting with Oliver Dowden, who was then the culture secretary, to discuss his pet project, a new “great exhibition”. Harri arrived in Downing Street on Monday promising to share out mineral water in place of the “excessive consumption of alcohol” condemned in Gray’s report. But there has been precious little evidence yet of a new, more sober approach to government taking root in No 10.",News/Politics,Little evidence of a fresh start in Boris Johnson’s mini-reshuffle ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/09/little-evidence-fresh-start-boris-johnson-mini-reshuffle-promoting-middle-aged-white-men-value-loyalty

The NSW opposition has called for people within the state’s Treasury to lose their jobs after the auditor general, Margaret Crawford, accused the department of an “unnecessarily obstructive and difficult” bid to withhold key information about a controversial $40bn rail corporation late last year.  In her report into the state’s finances, released on Wednesday, the auditor took the dramatic step of slapping Treasury with an “extreme risk finding” to “significantly improve governance processes to ensure complete and timely sharing of information”. It is the second damaging report from the NSW auditor’s office in two days, after Tuesday’s report into the government’s Stronger Communities Fund found 96% of $252m in grants had been distributed in Coalition-held seats. On Wednesday, Crawford detailed events leading up to her long-awaited signoff of the state’s finances on Christmas Eve after a three-month delay caused by her concerns surrounding the controversial Transport Asset Holding Entity (Tahe), which holds $40bn in NSW rail assets. Last month the Guardian revealed Crawford had warned that the government could be forced to spend another $4.1bn over the next decade to address “significant uncertainties” in relation to Tahe. Crawford said that during the long negotiation over the state’s audits between July and December, Treasury provided the auditor with “late, unsophisticated, and inaccurate forecasts” that “sought to support the desired outcome of higher projected returns” from Tahe. “This process of seeking ordinary representations from NSW Treasury’s management, that all key documents were made available to audit, was unnecessarily obstructive and difficult,” she wrote in the report. “Before management signed the representation to declare they had shared all relevant information, they shared at least a further 34 megabytes of data, or 23 reports (1,023 pages), with the Audit Office, around midnight, the morning of audit signing.” Crawford also revealed how she had considered taking the unprecedented step of issuing a qualified audit over the state’s finances until the government agreed to provide $1.1bn in additional funding to pay for a huge increase in fees paid to Tahe for access to the state’s rail assets. The increase was confirmed in a heads of agreement deal signed on 18 December 2021 between Tahe and its “customers”, the state’s rail networks. Labelling Treasury’s disclosures as “inadequate”, Crawford’s damning report said the challenges in completing the audit had been “extraordinary” and had “tested the constructive partnership between the Audit Office and NSW Treasury”. “Our assessments were hindered by errors and omissions in information and models provided by NSW Treasury to demonstrate expected returns from Tahe, as well as a lack of timeliness and completeness in their responses to requests for documentation to support NSW Treasury’s proposed accounting of government’s contributions to Tahe,” she wrote. Labor’s shadow treasurer Daniel Mookhey labelled the report the “most severe lashing of any government I’ve ever read”. “It’s clear that government and Treasury were engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct as they raced to stop the Tahe from detonating the state’s budget,” he said. “The tactics of withholding information, and providing the auditor general with misleading answers are despicable. “Those responsible need to lose their jobs. The premier, the treasurer and the Treasury all have serious questions to answer about the integrity of their actions in the Tahe saga.” The government established Tahe in 2015 as a way of transferring the state’s $40bn of rail assets out of the hands of the transport department and into a state-owned corporation. The decision had significant benefits for the government’s bottom line. Because Tahe could lease the state’s rail assets back to service operators such as Sydney Trains, the government could classify funding to the corporation as “equity injections” which did not have a negative impact on the budget. But under accounting rules, Tahe was required to show both that the entity remained entirely independent of the government and that it would turn a profit. In November, the auditor said “significant accounting issues” remained with the body, and delayed signing off on the state’s finances. While the government has trumpeted her unqualified audit, Crawford again warned of significant uncertainties to the government’s budget bottom line because much of the $5.2bn needed to fund the Tahe over the next decade has not been signed off in the budget. A parliamentary inquiry into Tahe is set to resume on Thursday, with the chair, Greens MP David Shoebridge, saying the auditor’s report had cut through the “smoke and mirrors” presented by Treasury. “Just over a month ago the premier and the now former treasury secretary was telling parliament and the public that the concerns over Tahe’s finances were unfounded,” he said. “Today we know that the concerns are worse than we could ever have suspected.” The treasurer, Matt Kean, has been contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,"NSW auditor general savages Treasury for ‘late, unsophisticated, and inaccurate forecasts’",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/nsw-auditor-general-savages-treasury-for-late-unsophisticated-and-inaccurate-forecasts
2/9/2022,"The last and longest-lasting berry crop has sustained some stupid and resourceful birds all through the winter. At least this wood pigeon acts stupid; standing there on the lawn for three minutes or maybe more, allowing every stealth hunter in the neighbourhood an unhurried approach and a long, lingering appraisal of its chances. I’m beginning to think the bird might be sick, when the pigeon rouses itself, waddles a few steps like a shopper laden with too many bags, pauses and cocks its head. It waddles a few more steps and tips its eye to the sky. Only then can I see that it’s actually looking hard at the fence, assessing the ivy for the ripeness of its fruit.  That silly plod has blinded me to the pigeon’s shrewd opportunism. All through the cold months, little gangs of wood pigeons have embarked on lightning raids into these slow-release plants. The berries of ivy, Britain’s only evergreen liana, darken into black maturity at widely differing rates, depending on location. Meanwhile, the pigeons watch from the roofs and treetops for the right moment to drop. In early December, a dozen or so flapped into a sun-kissed west-facing hedge for an orgiastic plucking party. And a six-pack descended again just before Christmas to plunder another “best not eaten before” stand looking south. I’ve not seen other birds feeding on ivy this winter, even though it’s the best harvest in my memory. Either ivy berries taste awful, are a last resort, or pigeons are first to the feast. A startle of white, a semaphore flash. The bold bars on my hitherto grounded pigeon’s raised wings draw in three others before it has even alighted on the ivy. Stretching for the nearest hanging fruit, it combines a gymnast’s grace with a bouncer’s weight. The thin bough bows, and the bird counteracts its sagging fortunes by turning wings into arms, fanning them out on both sides, holding position, spreading its weight. Pluck, pluck, pluck, for just a few seconds, and then the quartet disperse. The birds are gone and berries remain. Thousands of them, all green, starved of sunlight on a north-facing fence, and maturing oh so slowly.",News/Environment,Country diary: The waddling wood pigeon is more shrewd than it appears,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/09/country-diary-the-waddling-wood-pigeon-is-more-shrewd-than-it-appears
2/9/2022,"Amid the swirl of friendships and interests involved in the Justin Langer fiasco, at least one thing unifies us all: whatever you think of their behaviour, it’s always mesmerising to watch the golden generation go. Evidently, they’ve still got it. Their public defence of Langer, their friend and teammate, after he chose to depart as coach rather than accept a six-month contract extension, has even left current players in awe . “Shows why they were so fucking good!” one said. “They stick together and look after each other.” Yes, the player is nameless. Why would any rational being risk incurring the ire of these guys? It’s true: they do look after each other. If you squint and listen hard enough, the shrill tones provide windows and echoes to what opponents faced back in their day, especially when things got tight.  Former Test captain Steve Waugh, the author of modern cricket’s greatest euphemism, “mental disintegration”, decried Cricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley’s “buzzwords” in his justification for CA’s position on Langer on Instagram. Another Test captain, Adam Gilchrist, replied underneath, “Nicely said skipper.” Damien Martyn noted that the current team “better keep winning”. Langer’s former opening partner Matthew Hayden, who once said that cricket “has got such a huge role to play in terms of [the] stability of mankind”, referred to sitting Test skipper Pat Cummins’ comments before Langer’s departure, in which he said a review of Langer’s performance was fair, as “garbage”. The image is clear. Cummins is the new bat, he’s run-out the best player, and the cordon’s going to let him know. It has been spellbinding to witness the public criticism – direct and implicit – from some of the past generation. But it’s instructive, too. Waugh and his contemporaries were the busiest manufacturers of the branding and mythology behind Baggy Green Inc. They are the arch custodians. The keepers of the flame. All self-appointed. As arguably the most successful team to ever play the game, it may well be they are convinced of the primacy of their views on all related matters by extension. As the contemporary embodiment of everything that made the baggy green great, at some level they may feel a move to reject Langer is a move to reject their group. There is a certain sadness to this. With Langer around, the team was still theirs. But the sun rises and the sun sets. Power is hard won, especially when wrested from this mob, as former oppositions will attest. They have been ferocious in public, even though some have been sending altogether more friendly messages to players in private, which is curious. Much as people protest that they simply don’t like the way Langer’s departure played out, it could also be argued that there was never going to be a dignified way to move on from Langer, who had doggedly set out his stall for a dynastic reign. Chairman of Selectors George Bailey on Tuesday encouraged former players to “reach out and get a good understanding of what’s happening.” Perhaps the golden generation don’t want to know. Cricket Australia is complicit. This is not the first time they’ve leveraged brand over substance. And to this end, Langer did exactly what he was there to do. Following the sandpaper scandal, he was co-opted by CA as a PR tool to rebuild the team in his image. His pure coaching credentials were moderate, and at best a secondary consideration. The soft power of aura and memory were greater sales tools than hard skills of coaching and education. Safety sells, and so does nostalgia. Think Steve Waugh on the balcony at Lord’s in 2019, Ricky Ponting the same. This stuff isn’t limited to cricket. In a piece for the Guardian last October about Manchester United’s own crisis, Barney Ronay wrote after a 5-0 thrashing that then-coach Ole Gunnar Solksjaer was “a manager in the job because of heritage power and brand-maintenance”. Some would argue that so too was Langer. His appointment was partly a brand play, and one only needs to watch Amazon’s The Test to understand the centrality of Brand Langer to Australian cricket at that time. In a moment of crisis, leveraging Langer – who tells us he is synonymous only with “honesty, respect, trust, truth, performance” – was the most effective antidote available for Cricket Australia to continue selling the game. Sadly, actual cricket coaching is missing from much of this conversation. It remains an amorphous, nebulous thing in this sport, jolting loosely according to the whims and style of the candidate in question. Langer approached the job like he did as a player, attempting to transplant his grit and single-mindedness, with mixed success. Despite Cummins’s magnanimity toward Langer’s “tweaks and changes”, those who argue Relaxo-Langer 2.0 took them to a new level at the T20 World Cup and the Ashes are misguided. The “back seat” was imposed on him, not chosen by him. The team’s subsequent success is correlated, and though many see this episode as a car crash, a larger car crash awaited were he retained. At its base level, the argument to retain him runs like this: “how can a team want to sack a coach when they’re winning?” But instead of a rhetorical dunk, maybe the authors might try, in good faith, to answer the question.",Sport/Sport,Justin Langer’s defenders come out swinging with Brand Baggy Green under threat | Sam Perry,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/09/justin-langers-defenders-come-out-swinging-with-brand-baggy-green-under-threat
