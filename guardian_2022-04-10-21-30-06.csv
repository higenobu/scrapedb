4/10/2022,"I read with great interest Simon Jenkins’ article (British sovereignty over the Falklands is an absurd imperial hangover that must end, 7 April). I visited the Falkland Islands on a couple of occasions between 1965 and 1967 on my way to Antarctica, and I got a pretty good impression from the people there about what they thought about Argentina and the Falklands’ relationship with Britain. In 1969 I was working in Argentina and got to see the other side of the coin. I was in a bar in Bahia Blanca watching the Apollo 11 moon landing in blurry black and white. Next to me at the bar was an Argentinian journalist and we fell into a long conversation about the Falklands. I will always remember something he said. He said, “Jim, try to imagine a different world where there has been a South American empire. The empire has gone now but, as a result of it, Argentina has sovereignty over Shetland and its surrounding waters. How do you think the people in Britain would feel about that situation? Do you think they would be willing to let it stand where a country half way round the world ‘owns’ some islands on their doorstep? Of course they wouldn’t. Well, that is the feeling in Argentina about the Malvinas. We feel that by simple geography that they belong to us, and one day we will try to get them back.” I have often thought about what he said and could see his point of view. And of course, what he said came true and they did try to take them. For all the flag-waving and jingoism about the Falklands, the situation there is, as Simon Jenkins says, an anachronism – and the sooner the situation is normalised the better.Jim SansburyBallater, Aberdeenshire  I’m sure I’m not alone in feeling some bafflement at Santiago Cafiero’s tin-eared piece on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands (Forty years after the Malvinas war, Britain still acts as if the dispute is settled. It isn’t, 2 April) Mr Cafiero, the foreign minister of Argentina, wants the UK to resume negotiations on the future of the islands. He speaks of past “conflict” and even “war”, but neglects to say that his country invaded the islands in 1982. He then goes on to wonder why Britain maintains a garrison on the Falklands when Argentina is a “vibrant democracy” that is “not a threat to anyone”. I can confirm that his country is a beautiful place, full of lovely people, but again, the minister forgets: for much of its history, Argentina has been overwhelmingly militaristic and authoritarian, and it could quite possibly be so again. But beyond this, no matter what merits his claims might have, and in light of events in Ukraine, does he think that violence is an acceptable way to settle claims of sovereignty? He says not, but had the British taskforce failed to retake the islands 40 years ago, would he still be so keen on “negotiations”? Somehow I doubt it.Robin PriorWargrave, Berkshire",News/UK news,Time has not healed the wounds of the Falklands,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/10/time-has-not-healed-the-wounds-of-the-falklands
4/10/2022,"Donald Trump has endorsed Dr Mehmet Oz for the Republican nomination for Senate in Pennsylvania, an expression of support for a fellow TV star which could test the former president’s grip on his party. Being on TV was “like a poll, that means people like you,” the former president and Celebrity Apprentice star said of Oz, a heart surgeon turned daytime host. Many on the pro-Trump hard right of the Republican party, however, question if Oz is a true conservative. In a statement before a rally in Selma, North Carolina on Saturday night, Trump said: “This is all about winning elections in order to stop the radical left maniacs from destroying our country. “The great commonwealth of Pennsylvania has a tremendous opportunity to Save America by electing the brilliant and well-known Dr Mehmet Oz for the United States Senate.” At his rally, Trump called Oz a “great guy, good man … Harvard-educated, tremendous, tremendous career and they liked him for a long time. That’s like a poll. You know, when you’re in television for 18 years, that’s like a poll, that means people like you.” Trump previously endorsed Sean Parnell, who withdrew after being accused by his wife of abusive behaviour, which he denied. David McCormick, a hedge fund executive, also sought Trump’s backing. The Senate is split 50-50, controlled by the vote of the vice-president, Kamala Harris. Control will be at stake in November. Republicans have indicated they could use the Senate to deny Joe Biden another supreme court pick. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee sought to portray Trump’s endorsement of Oz as divisive. “The Republican Senate primary in Pennsylvania was already nasty, expensive and brutal,” said a spokesperson, Patrick Burgwinkle. “Now Trump’s endorsement will only intensify this intra-party fight, just like it has in GOP Senate primaries across the country – leaving their ultimate nominee badly damaged and out of step with the voters who will decide the general election.” Oz has been accused of being out of step with Pennsylvania voters not least because he entered the race after living two decades in New Jersey. His entry to politics also brought renewed attention on his TV career, which began on Oprah Winfrey’s show. In 2014, Oz told senators some products he promoted, including a “miracle” green coffee bean extract, lacked “scientific muster”. The following year, a group of prominent doctors accused Oz of displaying “an egregious lack of integrity” and promoting “quack treatments”. Politically speaking, prominent pro-Trump figures have said Oz is not a conservative. The former White House adviser Steve Bannon said: “How does Dr Oz, probably the most anti-Maga guy, and you got Fox non-stop pimping this guy out and Newsmax pimping this guy out, and that’s what it is – how does Dr Oz, from New Jersey, [Turkish president Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan’s buddy, floating in from Jersey, how does he become a factor in a Senate race in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania?” In his endorsement, Trump said Oz was especially popular with women because of his work in daytime TV and could do well in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Democratic-leaning cities. The former president also mentioned his own controversial appearance on Oz’s show in the 2016 campaign, when Trump showed partial results of a physical. Trump said: “He even said that I was in extraordinary health, which made me like him even more (although he also said I should lose a couple of pounds!)” Trump, who appointed Oz to a White House advisory role, also presented him as anti-abortion, “very strong on crime, the border, election fraud, our great military and our vets, tax cuts” and gun rights. Oz said: “President Trump wisely endorsed me because I’m a conservative who will stand up to Joe Biden and the woke left.” Polling shows Oz and McCormick evenly matched. The winner is likely to face the Democrat John Fetterman, currently lieutenant governor, in the November election. Speaking to Politico, a “person close to Trump … noted a phrase that Trump has often repeated when talking about Oz: ‘He’s been on TV in people’s bedrooms and living rooms for years.’”",News/US news,‘TV is like a poll’: Trump endorses Dr Oz for Pennsylvania Senate nomination,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/10/tv-is-like-a-poll-trump-endorses-dr-oz-for-pennsylvania-senate-nomination
4/10/2022,"My friend Rosie Wyatt, who has died aged 67 of cancer, began her career teaching English in Germany and went on to become a founding director of VIA International management consultancy in 1989. She was a pioneer of flexible working. Her career as a management consultant was global, taking her to India, Spain and frequently the US, among other countries. While at Arthur Andersen, which she joined in 1986 as a change manager, she advocated part-time working, and at VIA she created an environment that promoted a healthy work-life balance, before the term had really been invented. She implemented open communication, all-round feedback, transparent pay, flexible hours, working from home, and longer maternity leave. Rosie was born in Yeovil, Somerset, one of four children of Rowena (nee Bedford), a farmer’s daughter and full-time mother, and David Wyatt, a bank manager for Lloyds. She grew up in Exeter, where she went to Bishop Blackall school for girls and Exeter college for sixth form. Following her degree in German at University College London, she taught English as a foreign language in a language school in Trier, Germany, where she went on to become head of the English department. After returning to the UK in 1979 she did a PGCE at the Institute of Education in London, and went on to teach French and German at an inner city comprehensive, Woodside school in Plaistow, east London, before leaving teaching for management consultancy. She retired from VIA in 2016. Rosie and I met in 1980 through a mutual friend and ended up living 10 doors apart with our respective husbands in Telegraph Hill, south-east London, where our children grew up together. Rosie believed in the power of working together for the common good. She volunteered as a school governor at the local primary and secondary schools and as box office manager for the Telegraph Hill arts festival. In 2020 she also helped set up Hatcham House, a co-working space in New Cross Gate, which supported the community through Covid-19 and beyond. The essence of Rosie was her interest in others, and her innate empathy, energy and warmth drew people to her. She was also a wonderful mentor to many, making time to share her wisdom, or to problem solve with a smile. Whatever she turned her hand to she reassured and encouraged people, never patronised and always listened. She was able to see the world through other people’s eyes. Rosie instigated a local walking group in 2000; her last walk was in June 2021. Even then, the rest of the group could not keep up with her. She also loved music and singing and was an active member of the Lewisham Choral Society, performing at the Royal Festival Hall and Queen Elizabeth Hall. Rosie described people as being “radiators” – exuding interest and warmth – and she certainly did. She had breast cancer on and off for 28 years. She is survived by her husband Alex Brewood, whom she met in 1983 and married in 2012, and their daughters, Siobhan and Katherine. Her first grandchild is due in August.",News/Business,Rosie Wyatt obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/10/rosie-wyatt-obituary
4/10/2022,"Bolognese sauce, or ragù, features in some shape or form in most UK households, and is usually made with beef mince. In Italy, however, it’s traditionally made with a mixture of pork and veal, though in the south lamb is much more popular, especially in spring. Crespelle, meanwhile, are a lighter alternative to cannelloni. All the various components can be used in other dishes – the tomato sauce with pasta, the bechamel in a gratin, the filling in a toasted sandwich and the pancakes as a pud, say – but combined as they are here, they make a very satisfying vegetarian dish that the whole family can enjoy. There are a few stages involved here, but they’re all pretty straightforward and can be made ahead of time, leaving you just to assemble and bake the dish when the time comes. Prep 10 minCook 1 hr 40 minServes 4-6 For the pancakes (to make 12)100g plain flour2 eggs300ml milk1 tbsp oil1 pinch saltButter, for frying For the tomato sauce2 tbsp olive oil5 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced1 pinch dried chilli flakes1 x 400g tin plum tomatoes1 tsp sugarSalt and pepper For the bechamel50g butter1 tbsp olive oil50g flour500ml whole milkGrated nutmeg, to taste50g vegetarian parmesan, grated For the filling500g spinach, washed1 tbsp olive oil25g butter1 tbsp marjoram leaves1 garlic clove, peeled and grated250g ricotta1 egg yolk75g vegetarian parmesan, grated, plus extra to serve First make the pancakes. Whisk the wet ingredients into the flour to make a thin batter, add a pinch of salt and leave to rest for at least five minutes. Melt a little butter in a nonstick pan over a medium heat, then pour in a ladle of the batter, tilting the pan so the base is covered evenly. Cook for a couple of minutes, until the bottom of the pancake is set, then flip and cook on the other side for a couple of minutes more. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining batter. Now for the sauce. Put the oil in a small pan on a low heat, add the garlic and dried chilli and cook until the garlic slices are opaque (and before they go brown). Add the tomatoes and sugar, season generously, then turn up the heat to medium and bring to a simmer. Turn down the heat, leave to cook slowly for at least 30 minutes, then blitz smooth and leave to cool. Next, the bechamel. Put the butter and olive oil in a pan on a low heat. Once melted, stir in the flour, beating it in with a wooden spoon until the mix is smooth, then cook gently, stirring, for five minutes. While the roux is cooking, heat up the milk in another pan – don’t let it boil – then stir into the first pan a ladle at a time and beating after each addition, until you have a smooth, thick sauce. Season well, add nutmeg to taste, simmer for five minutes, then stir in the cheese. Now for the pancake filling. Heat the oil in a large pan, tip in the spinach and cook, stirring, over a high heat, until wilted. Season, tip into a colander set over a bowl. Once the spinach has cooled, squeeze out any excess moisture, then roughly chop. Melt the butter in a large pan, add the marjoram and garlic, and cook for a minute. Tip in the chopped spinach, braise for a few minutes in the flavoured butter, then tip into a bowl and leave to cool. Once cooled, mix in the ricotta, egg yolk, vegetarian hard cheese and seasonings. Finally, the assembly and cooking. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Butter a large ovenproof dish in which 12 rolled-up pancakes will fit snugly. Spread half the bechamel in the bottom of the dish and top with half the tomato sauce. Divide the filling between the pancakes, then roll up each one. Arrange the pancakes on top of the tomato sauce, then cover, first with the remaining sauce, and then the bechamel. Sprinkle over the extra cheese, and bake for 15 minutes, until the top is golden.

Season well, then transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Tip the finely diced vegetables into the oily pan, cook on a medium heat, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, then stir in the garlic, chilli, fennel and anchovy, and cook for another minute. Return the lamb to the pan, mix with the veg, then turn up the heat, add the wine and cook until it’s all but evaporated. Add the passata, bring to a simmer and cook for five minutes. Pour in the stock and simmer for another 10 minutes, until the sauce is quite thick; while it’s cooking, break up any lumps of meat so the sauce is smooth. Add the milk, simmer for 15 or so minutes, until the sauce is thick and creamy, then stir in the vinegar and peas, season again to taste (be generous) and cook for three minutes. The sauce is now ready. Cook your chosen pasta in lots of salted boiling water according to the packet instructions, until al dente, then drain, reserving a small cup of the cooking water. Fold the sauce through the pasta, add grated parmesan to taste and season again; if the pasta seems a little dry, add some of the reserved pasta water. Serve with extra grated cheese on the side.

4/10/2022,"When she came to prominence as a member of the rap collective Odd Future, it was difficult to pinpoint the sonic identity of Sydney Bennett, AKA Syd amid the outsized musical personalities of fellow bandmates such as Tyler, the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. In the decade since Odd Future released their last mixtape, Bennett has been finding her sound – mainly as the lead singer of alternative R&B group the Internet – in an intimate, nocturnal register. On her second album, Broken Hearts Club, this introspection continues, with varying results. Its finest moments come when she collaborates. There’s the Prince-esque funk of Cybah (featuring Lucky Daye) and the guitar-strumming R&B of Out Loud (featuring Kehlani). On Heartfelt Freestyle, meanwhile, she artfully flips the yearning melody of Texas trio Khruangbin’s White Gloves. Alone, though, Bennett’s vocals fade into the background. Her breathy tone on Fast Car struggles against its thumping backing, while the solo piano of Goodbye My Love feels too exposing, pushing her into mumbling. Bennett’s voice is ultimately too thin to carry the emotive heft of her heartbreak material, and Broken Hearts Club works best when she facilitates others to take up its mantle.",Arts/Music,Syd: Broken Hearts Club review – introspection with a little help from her friends,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/10/syd-broken-hearts-club-review-odd-future-internet
4/10/2022,"Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has been drawn into the “non-dom” controversy after admitting he held the status for six years while a banker, allowing him to legally avoid tax on overseas earnings. The senior cabinet minister, a former chancellor, gave a statement to the Sunday Times saying he had held non-dom status, thought to be on the grounds that his father was born in Pakistan. He also admitted to holding wealth in an offshore trust until he became a minister in 2012, dissolving it and paying 50% tax on the wealth he brought into the UK. “I have been domiciled in the UK for tax purposes throughout my entire public life,” he said. “Given heightened public interest in these issues, I want to be open about my past tax statuses. My career before politics was in international finance. For almost two decades I constantly travelled around the world for work.” Before he became an MP in 2010, Javid said he had spent some years as a non-dom, giving this up in 2009. “For some of those years I was non-domiciled for tax purposes, but I paid all UK taxes due on my income and have always done so,” he said. “In 2006 I moved to Singapore with my family and was therefore no longer a UK tax resident. In 2009, upon my return to the UK, I became tax resident in the UK again and also proactively chose to give up my non-domiciled status by making the UK my ‘domicile of choice’.” He added: “Prior to returning to the UK and entering public life, some of my financial investments were based in an offshore trust. While this was an entirely legitimate arrangement, on becoming a minister in 2012 I decided to voluntarily collapse that trust, repatriate all assets to the UK and pay 50% income tax on those assets. “This approach deliberately incurred the heaviest possible tax burden, and offset any accrued benefits from the previous trust arrangement, but I believed it was the right thing to do.” As chancellor before Rishi Sunak, Javid had boasted the Conservatives had introduced more than 100 measures to “tackle aggressive tax avoidance and evasion” in order to make the tax system “simpler and, most importantly, fairer”.",News/Politics,Sajid Javid admits he held non-dom status before political career,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/10/sajid-javid-non-dom-status-before-political-career-sunak
4/10/2022,"With or without a cost of living emergency the UK government looked vulnerable. A chancellor losing his once golden touch, a prime minister questioned by police about partying in lockdown. Boris Johnson’s party veers from scandal to scandal. That households are suffering the biggest squeeze on living standards since modern records began in the 1950s adds insult to injury, ahead of a local election campaign that will test the Conservative vote-winning machine. For those out canvassing for the party ahead of next month’s polls, what positive news is there to talk about? This time last year the political landscape was very different. Furlough had kept the worst economic ravages of Covid at bay, while a hoped-for end to the pandemic was hoving into view thanks to rapid progress with the vaccine programme. Boris Johnson was on a high, promising “jabs, jabs, jabs and jobs, jobs, jobs” as his party crushed Labour in the polls. When voters head to the ballot box on 5 May they’ll have less to feel good about. Growth may have returned, but it won’t feel like it for many. Whereas the average household budget was barely hit by the Covid recession, with many saving record sums during lockdown thanks to government support, this year will be marked by the lack of help as incomes plummet. Despite economic growth in aggregate, the typical family will suffer the worst financial damage since records began around the time postwar rationing came to an end. Over the past four decades, real household disposable incomes have fallen on just four previous occasions: three times following the 2008 financial crisis, and again after Brexit crashed the pound, knocking Britain’s spending power. On an official basis the UK economy recovered its pre-Covid level around the turn of the year, after a sharp but thankfully short recession. However, the downturn is still going for most people, with average real incomes now expected to take until 2024 to bounce back – a full two years later. Given these factors it’s surprising Rishi Sunak chose not to do more at his spring statement mini-budget. The chancellor had been fond of talking about “building a bridge” over the economic ravine opened up by Covid. While he was broadly successful, the task is clearly not complete. According to the New Economics Foundation, more than 34% of the population – as many as 23.5 million people – will be unable to afford the cost of living this year. Using a metric known as the minimum income standard – based on public polling of what people think is needed to meet socially accepted basic expenses – it estimates almost half of all children will fall below the line. The hit will be more significantly felt outside of London and the south-east, with 44% of all families in the north-east falling below the minimum income standard. Given the squeeze will have a disproportionate impact on poorer regions, it’s all the more remarkable Sunak omitted any new funding for levelling up at his spring statement. Having refused to increase benefits in-line with soaring inflation, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation warns Britain will see the biggest fall in the value of the basic rate of out-of-work benefit in 50 years. After a decade of cuts and freezes made under the Conservatives’ austerity drive, this benefit has lost value in eight of the last 10 years. Not only have the Tories failed to soften the current cost of living crisis, they dismantled vital support systems in the years preceding it. The big danger now is that such intransigence could set the conditions for a worse recession ahead. Most forecasters expect the squeeze on households could ease next year, yet risks are growing that what started as a temporary pinch might be locked-in for much longer. Talk of a recession is rising on both sides of the Atlantic. With household finances suffering a heavy blow, consumer spending is expected to slow sharply, while the prospect of a sustained rise in business investment could be put on ice thanks to the mounting uncertainty. In the US, economists have started to warn that a recession shock is coming. Official figures this week are expected to reveal a slowdown in the UK economy during February and yet another rise in inflation. Last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned there was a one-in-five chance that GDP would fall this year or next, amid uncertainty over Russia’s war in Ukraine, inflation, global commodity prices and Covid. There is growing agreement that Sunak will need to do more. Steffan Ball, the chief UK economist at Goldman Sachs, and former chair of one-time Tory chancellor Phillip Hammond’s council of economic advisers, expects Sunak will be called on to act. First and foremost, a rise in benefits is required to soften the blow from soaring living costs. Beyond doing so for basic reasons of fairness and to support wider activity in a faltering economy, Ball highlights a technical inconsistency that could be addressed. Since the 1980s governments have typically raised the value of benefits each April by the rate of inflation in the previous September, aiming to keep them in line with living costs. For this year, however, last autumn’s inflation rate of 3.1% now looks badly out of step as the measure for the rising cost of living surges towards 8%. Looking ahead to this autumn, inflation is forecast by the OBR to be 7.5% come September, meaning a big rise in welfare is pencilled in for spring 2023. Yet when households are in most need now, and with inflation forecast to fall back sharply next year, a case could be made for pulling the increase forward. The government must, at a minimum, increase the value of benefits to show it is serious about helping those most at need. Failure to do so would only ensure that conditions for rising poverty become entrenched, while political parties with a record for making poorer don’t tend to do well in the polls.",News/Business,Cost of living crisis: Rishi Sunak must at the very least raise UK benefits ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/10/cost-of-living-crisis-rishi-sunak-must-at-the-very-least-raise-uk-benefits
