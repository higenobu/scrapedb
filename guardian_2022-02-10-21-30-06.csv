2/10/2022,"Scotland’s health secretary, Humza Yousaf, has accused Boris Johnson of announcing an end to England’s Covid restrictions as a blatant attempt to “distract and deflect” attention from the partygate crisis. Yousaf said the policy appeared to have been cooked up at Downing Street with little scientific or expert support. The prime minister had failed to notify the UK’s devolved governments about the move, a signal it was a hasty political decision.  “This wasn’t a thought-out policy backed up by public health expert advice, it was a dead cat thrown on the dispatch box of the House of Commons in order to distract and deflect,” Yousaf said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. He said the Scottish government, which sets its own policies on Covid restrictions, had since asked for clarification about the basis of Johnson’s decision but had not yet had any. It had no plans to follow suit, he added. “Since this decision was made – and it was a unilateral decision, one that wasn’t discussed with any of the other three nations of the UK – we’ve asked for that public health advice and none has been forthcoming. “And I think we should just be frank … This was clearly an attempt to deflect scrutiny away from the prime minister’s behaviour”. Johnson told MPs he expects to end England’s self-isolation rules for those infected with or exposed to Covid this month, a full month earlier than the 24 March expiry date currently set out in the regulations. A legal requirement to self-isolate will be replaced by unenforceable advice to do so. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is due to publish a comprehensive plan on a phased end to Covid restrictions on 22 February. She announced on Thursday that pupils and teachers in secondary schools in Scotland would no longer need to wear face coverings in classrooms from 28 February. Face masks in schools and physical distancing rules in enclosed spaces have been mandatory in Scotland. Prof Andrew Watterson, a public health expert at Stirling University, said Johnson’s proposals were a “leap in the dark” and were out of step with policy across Europe. It would be unwise for Scotland to follow the prime minister’s lead, he said. “It’s almost a big-bang approach by the UK government, a leap in the dark,” he told BBC Radio Scotland on Thursday. “It’s not measured in terms of gradually relaxing the controls, it’s a big leap. But there’s also confusion because it’s quite clear that what’s being called for, and even the prime minister has said this, is not an end to self-isolation, it’s an end to the regulation about it.” The Scottish Conservatives have argued that Sturgeon’s government needs to lift its restrictions far sooner, to help businesses recover and allow life to return to normal. They argued it was contradictory for children to wear face coverings for seven hours a day in school while their parents could sit in a pub or office in close proximity to others without face masks. The conflict between the two parties escalated after the Tories complained that Scotland’s chief medical officer, Sir Gregor Smith, had retweeted a political attack by Yousaf on Johnson in breach of civil service rules on impartiality. In that tweet, Yousaf repeated his allegation the prime minister wanted to “distract and deflect”.

2/10/2022,"Carlos Acosta doesn’t currently perform with the company that bears his name, but it embodies everything he hoped to put out into the world with its launch in 2016: taking Cuban choreography around the globe with a set of gifted dancers whose versatile bodies speak in multiple languages of ballet, contemporary, urban, African and Latin dance. Their hybrid abilities and Cuban pride are seen most overtly in De Punta a Cabo, created by Alexis Fernández and Yaday Ponce. The execution is primary coloured, dancing on pointe along Havana’s sea wall, but there’s something intoxicating about these dancers and you’re gradually absorbed into their night-out vibes. Their talents are more dexterously demonstrated in Pontus Lidberg’s Paysage, Soudain, la Nuit, where the Swedish choreographer soaks up some Cuban influences with minimal cliche. You can see the classicism in the precision of placings, Raul Reinoso’s leg beautifully extended a la seconde, but also their facility in contemporary language, especially Mario Sergio Elías’s easy elasticity; then there’s Latin footwork sewn into the fabric of the choreography. It’s well crafted and quietly mesmerising.  Talking of mesmerising, there’s Zeleidy Crespo, dancing Impronta, a solo by Spanish choreographer María Rovira. You can see her taking pleasure in her rich physicality in the moment and yet channelling something bigger; she is the percussive beat of the music as well as perfectly calibrated architectural angles. Crespo’s long limbs carve some finessed shapes in the opener Liberto, choreographed by Reinoso. It draws on Cuba’s history of slavery, but really focuses on the dynamic between the two dancers, Crespo and Elías, the pair folding their forms in complex origami. It’s the first of two new pieces in the programme, both of which feel underdeveloped compared with a more established dance-maker like Lidberg. The second is Hybrid, by Norge Cedeno and Thais Suárez, which picks up on some similar themes to Liberto: struggle and uprising, subjugation and freedom, with 12 solider-like dancers on a red-drenched stage. Still, choreographers cannot grow if their work doesn’t get a chance to see the light. The identity of the company is strong and the dancers are well worth watching. At Sadler’s Wells, London, until 12 February, then touring.",Arts/Stage,Acosta Danza: 100% Cuban review – Carlos’s mesmerising movers,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/10/acosta-danza-100-per-cent-cuban-review-carlos-acosta-company-sadlers-wells
2/10/2022,"Harry Winks says that he is determined to repay the faith of Antonio Conte after admitting he feared his Tottenham career was “dead and buried”. The midfielder was marginalised under the previous manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, who started him only once in the Premier League this season before being replaced by Conte in early November.  Winks had also fallen from favour under Nuno’s predecessor José Mourinho and was expected to seek a transfer during the January window. But Conte was impressed with Winks’s performances in the league games against Liverpool and Southampton in December, after starting him, and he said at the end of the month that the player would stay after proving “reliable”. Winks, who won the last of his 10 England caps against Iceland in November 2020, drove the team in the 3-1 FA Cup win over Morecambe on 9 January, showing a good attitude on a day when Conte substituted Tanguy Ndombele, Bryan Gil and Dele Alli as Spurs trailed 1-0. All three would be moved on in January – together with a fourth player, Giovani Lo Celso. Winks has started in all five of Spurs’s games since, most recently the 3-2 home loss to Southampton on Wednesday night, when they threw away a 2-1 lead late on. “The manager’s come in and given me a chance, given me confidence again,” Winks said. “Every game I play and every training session, I have that hunger to impress him and do everything I can to improve. “My career at Tottenham was probably dead and buried but he’s come in and given me an opportunity to prove myself. And for that, every time I get an opportunity, I really want to impress the manager and repay that faith he’s shown in me.” Winks rowed back slightly on his “dead and buried” comment but the sense did not change. “I wouldn’t say it was completely dead and buried but my chances at Tottenham were looking slim,” he said. “I wasn’t getting opportunities and it might have looked like I would need to leave the club. I don’t know. “As I said, the new manager’s come in and given everyone an equal opportunity, which is all I wanted under the last two managers. Now it’s down to me to take that.” Winks can feel the competition from the January signing Rodrigo Bentancur but it was interesting that Conte introduced the Uruguayan as a substitute for Pierre-Emile Højbjerg against Southampton – rather than Winks. Oliver Skipp, who is out with a groin injury, is Conte’s other option in central midfield. Conte hopes to have Skipp back for the trip to Manchester City on Saturday week. “It was a poor performance and result against Southampton,” Winks said. “When we’re not playing well but leading we need to find a way of not conceding. We were too passive, too easy to play against and defensively as a team it wasn’t solid enough. We let them play. We let them suffocate us.”",Sport/Football,Harry Winks out to repay Conte after fearing Spurs career was ‘dead and buried’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/10/harry-winks-repay-antonio-conte-feared-spurs-career-dead-and-buried
2/10/2022,"You know the feeling when you’ve waited ages for a bus, then two come along at once? It seems like only yesterday that I reviewed Jimmy McGovern’s prison drama, Time, and referenced it as a rare example of authenticity – one of the few works that gave me a feeling of being back in prison. Then along comes Screw (Channel 4), which is every bit as good. When I started writing about prisons – as a change from committing the crimes that occasionally landed me in them – a press officer at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) asked me if I would stop referring to prison officers as “screws”, as it was somewhat demeaning. My dictionary agreed; it defines the word as: “informal, derogatory, a prison warder”. I wonder if the MoJ have complained to Rob Williams, Screw’s creator?  In fact, the relationship between prison officers and those they lock up is, by far, the most important factor of the prison experience. Yes, of course, major policy decisions are taken at MoJ level, and governors have some degree of autonomy – although by no means as much as they used to (and should still have). But, in a nutshell, good screws make for decent prisons, bad ones turn them into hate factories. Long Marsh, the setting for Screw, appears to be an OK jail, largely, perhaps, because it has a higher than average number of female officers in a male establishment. I remember when this came into being in our penal system, in the early 90s. The women’s presence lowered the temperature on the wings and landings. The central character, Leigh (Nina Sosanya), a senior officer, who runs C wing, hooked me immediately. She is efficient, firm and fair, but married to the job to the extent of requisitioning a vacant cell in order to sleep. She believes her charges are “not bad people, they have just done bad things”. One sardonic sage of an inmate remarks that “she knows we are here for revenge, not rehabilitation”. As true a line as ever was. And the accuracy of the dialogue continues to shine when new recruit Rose delivers a gem to a patronising male colleague who asks her why she’s in the job. “Because I’m good at shutting up dickheads,” she retorts. Screw also shows how our jails reflect the serious issues that exist outside their walls. In a scene familiar to me, a prisoner objects to being served halal meat. I challenged a fellow inmate who did the same, some 25 years ago, long before the current wave of anti-Muslim feeling swept into society. I imagine it to be commonplace in these darker days. The two biggest problems in the system right now are mental health and drugs – related, of course. As much as I praised Time, I had issues with the plot, where villains went to great lengths to force Stephen Graham’s prison officer character, Eric McNally, to smuggle drugs into his place of work. Taking drugs into prisons is more tempting for prison officers than you might think, and Screw nails this truth. A male officer asks Rose how she thinks most of the drugs get into the prison. She suggests they are smuggled in on visits, or chucked over the wall. Dismissively, he replies: “Officers. Not everyone in charge keeps on the straight and narrow.” Spot on the money. The profit margins soar way above street prices. Bringing a small amount of drugs into their workplace – particularly class A drugs – could earn them a couple of thousand pounds, for a relatively small risk. How do I know? Because although drug dealing was never my game, I know plenty who played it and know where and with whom they placed their trust and money. From the other side, I have the word of a former prison governor, John Podmore – a good pal. He tells me his staff often seized hauls of drugs in his establishments, but his biggest find, by far, was discovered “strapped to the leg of an officer”. Screw’s look at mental health in prisons also rings incredibly true. There’s a short flash of Long Marsh inmates receiving their daily liquid cosh. This is the slang for meds that, usually, leave those taking them spaced out – and not a threat to anyone. The way the inmates queued up like zombies to get their drugs reminded me of the medication scenes in the brilliant One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. But I think the line that best sums up the mental health problems in jails comes when a health worker is struggling to assess the number of prisoners who are on the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) register – the care-planning process for prisoners identified as being at risk of suicide or self-harm. Leigh asks her to urgently see a potential suicide risk. The woman says she has too much on that day – and we see the bundle of ACCT files she is carrying – but will try and see the new guy “some time this week”. Leigh says: “Remind me why we closed the asylums?” Reply: “Nobody liked locking up people with mental health problems.” Anyone wishing to know the facts behind the story should look at the latest MoJ figures on deaths and self-harm in prisons, published last week. It’s this persistent parade of truths about jails that makes Screw one of the best fictional prison tales. It’s rammed with issues and scenes that should shame those responsible for running this failing system. Back in my bad old prison days, we used to say that we wouldn’t piss on a screw if he was burning to death – coined before women entered the male system. Not particularly edifying, but it summed up our feelings. In fairness, though, on my last sentence, a seven stretch that ended just before the millennium, I came across more decent prison officers than I had encountered in the previous four decades. Nowadays, they feel unloved, an officer in Screw laments, claiming that the public “love the police [questionable!], firefighters and NHS staff, but not us”. Did I love those who treated me with decency? I always started off being polite to screws – and everybody in jail. If they returned the compliment, we all did easy time. But there is one thing that I am very near to adoring – and that is Screw.",Arts/Television & radio,‘A persistent parade of truths about jails’ – a former HMP inmate on Screw,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/10/screw-a-persistent-parade-of-truths-about-jails-a-former-hmp-inmate-on-screw
2/10/2022,"Maybe the hardest trick in rock music is to do what John Peel credited as the singular ability of the Fall – to sound always different, but always the same. Plenty of groups have flourished by always being the same; plenty more artists see it as their duty to make sure each album sounds utterly unlike the one before. But to sustain a career without ever completely repeating yourself, yet never leave anyone wondering what the heck you’ve done to the group they loved, is something few manage to pull off. Ten albums and nearly 30 years into their career, Spoon still sound like Spoon: fresh, timeless and wholly in control of their work.  The Spoon sound – spacious, uncluttered but powerful, both scratchy and crystalline – is so distinct that even the fact no individual element sounds even remotely unusual makes no odds. Britt Daniel’s voice – not powerful, but a soulful yowl – has character, but his guitar playing isn’t going to have putative axe heroes trying to work out his technique. The single most notable element – the drumming of the band’s other pole, Jim Eno – is marked by restraint, rather than flashiness. Bass, keyboards and any other elements (horns, electronics) are there to colour the songs, rather than dominate. Spoon can be a bit funky, a bit poppy, a bit rocky, but always them. The result is a career that has rather defied the expectations levied on bands who spend virtually all their career on indie labels (Spoon had a very brief and very miserable spell with Elektra early on). Though never more than a cult concern in the UK – on their last visit to London, they didn’t fill the 2,300-capacity Forum – they’ve become a significant act back home in the US, with top 10 albums and big gigs: a few years back, Daniel characterised their level of success as the kind that enables him to get tables in good restaurants without being hassled while he eats. The advantage of sounding only like yourself, rather than part of a wave of like-minded groups, is that your sound tends to remain current, rather than being an aid to carbon-dating past pop-cultural sounds. Aside from their debut album, Telephono – a superior but generic piece of 90s alt-rock – every Spoon record sounds like it could be their current one. When the past is plundered on Lucifer on the Sofa, it is brought into Spoon’s world – so the bluesy, Stones-y piano chords of Wild’s chorus are overlaid not on to Keith’n’Ronnie riffing, but a nervous, twitching guitar pattern that has a little of the air of U2, and they are held back until 80 seconds in for maximum impact, before the guitars ramp up further. The album opens with a cover of Smog’s Held, so Spoonified that you really wouldn’t know it was a cover unless you knew the original, but without rendering it anywhere near unrecognisable. Within the constraints of their music not being intended to smash down new sonic barriers, Spoon introduce dynamism by means of structure: nothing on Lucifer on the Sofa sounds like it was bashed out at the last minute; everything sounds in its place, considered. But that doesn’t make the resultant songs arid. If you think of it like architecture, that kind of attention to detail can sometimes make records sound like the lobbies of boutique hotels – elegant and tasteful and stylish and utterly characterless – whereas this sounds like a place in which you want to spend time soaking up the details. My Babe, for example, builds so gently and naturally from its opening acoustic guitar and piano, Eno’s drums introducing propulsion before the addition of those embellishments – the shivery piano trill around 80 seconds in. When the electric guitars enter, after more than two minutes, it’s like sluice gates opening, a flood of power. It sounds triumphant, so much so you can forgive it being called My Babe. Just 10 songs long, and without a single surplus inch around its narrow waist, Lucifer on the Sofa simply refuses to countenance the notion of having a single dull second. Production is by Mark Rankin, whose work with Queens of the Stone Age had attracted Daniel’s attention, and he adds oomph and weight but without ever overwhelming the songs: there’s as much importance in the space as there is in the chords. Truthfully, though, Spoon are so completely their own band that any producer only adds shading in the margins. There aren’t really bad Spoon albums. There are really good Spoon albums and there are excellent Spoon albums. Lucifer on the Sofa is one of the latter. What a delight.",Arts/Music,Spoon: Lucifer on the Sofa review – timeless perfection from US indie stalwarts,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/10/spoon-lucifer-on-the-sofa-review-timeless-perfection-from-us-indie-stalwarts
2/10/2022,"Amarried woman has a BDSM encounter at a conference. Sex in an artificially generated afterlife. A bisexual woman cheats on her wife with a baker … and all as written by Louise Erdrich or Chigozie Obioma or Téa Obreht or Paul Theroux or Helen Oyeyemi or Jeet Thayil or any one of 20-odd other authors. That’s the tease of a new collection of erotic short stories, Anonymous Sex. Editors Hillary Jordan and Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan write in their introduction that they wanted to “create intrigue” by not revealing which of the high-profile contributors have written which story: “Readers would have to guess.” A fatal premise is revealed: writing about sex is risky because one’s own predilections might be unmasked in the process. This is odd, given for example the recent anthology Kink, edited by RO Kwon and Garth Greenwell, whose contributors (including Alexander Chee and Carmen Maria Machado) felt no need for such a cover. Anonymous Sex feels old-fashioned, as if it’s arrived too late, too apologetically, on the stage.  The authors in the collection are truly global, yet the book’s premise shares something with one of the UK’s most wince-inducing exports: the Bad Sex award in fiction. The rationale of the award – to “draw attention to the crude, tasteless, often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel, and to discourage it” – combines the kind of finger-wagging moralism and chortling jocularity recognisable to anyone familiar with English culture. Apart from its dubious assumptions (whose taste?), its aims are clear: to humiliate writers for “unnecessary” incursions into the erotic, and perhaps too for revealing something of themselves in this process. Anonymous Sex ostensibly does the opposite – it is encouraging sex writing. But it wants things both ways: to create the conditions for an untrammelled erotic freedom in writing, while also inviting us to sniff the writer out. Some of the stories are fantastic; several are fine; a few are not. Some are elegant and arch, some witty and bawdy. In the almost knowingly quaint Find Me, a widow takes a long train ride across America to join a new husband, sharing a night of passion with an exciting bandit. The Next Eleven Minutes conjures the hazy border between vertiginous sexual excitement and terrifying insanity. Rapunzel, Rapunzel is a charming, sexy retelling of the tale; Love Doll an intriguing exploration of racialised power dynamics set in Hawaii in a multicultural English language class My outright favourite is En Suite, a story of two young women friends on a trip to a seaside town, staying in a cheap – and badly soundproofed – hotel. The story moves briskly between awkward, unpleasant or comedic encounters with other holidaymakers to evoke the flaring of desire between the two women. It’s a tale of longing, mishaps and missed opportunities, capturing the sense of possibility and terror that desire can evoke. It’s gorgeous and heartbreaking, and whoever wrote it is in supreme command of their skills. What a shame we don’t know who it is! History Lesson opens with an epigraph from psychotherapist Esther Perel, portentously announcing its themes: “Most of us get turned on at night by the very things that we’ll demonstrate against during the day.” Denise, a married professor, has an arrangement with Michael, another professor: they meet at an annual conference; she agrees to his every desire, including to his filming their sex; an element of jeopardy is introduced in the threat of the video being released to the conference attenders. The story unfolds with a confidence occasionally punctured by its own solemn self-consciousness. When Michael texts Denise: “Tell me you’re a slut”, we’re told: “To be clear: this was not a word Denise approved of in most contexts.” Here, we are being interrupted by the author’s anxiety; the need to spell out a political affiliation even when trying, mostly well, to evoke erotic dynamics that necessarily evade political positions. We’re being reassured that we’re entitled to enjoy this kinky story of domination and submission, through sentences such as: “It helped, certainly, that while Denise was a nationally recognised name in her field, Michael was just as happily tenured and well-published; no one could help anyone’s career here.” We can put out of our minds egregious stories of workplace harassment and coercion. This story, the writer insists, is ethically unproblematic. In a sense, the Bad Sex awards are not wrong: authors are often hampered in writing about sex. But what makes sex writing bad is what makes any writing bad: if it is evasive, if it is unsure about why it exists, if it doesn’t know what it’s doing, if it retreats into metaphor as a substitute for precision. The anthology’s editors are not wrong either: authors are fearful of being seen through the veil of fictions they write. And this can make fictional accounts of sex unbearably coy, or over-compensatory, moving between the desire to obfuscate and an impatient, defiant urge to be bold. What if the editors had, instead of conferring anonymity, encouraged the authors to write as much as possible without the censorious eye over the shoulder? “She was in a world that didn’t follow logic,” we’re clumsily told in History Lesson. Yes, sexuality is not rational, we’ve understood that much. But how much better this story would be if that sentence were left out, and we went straight to the following one: “She was on a distant moon.” Ah!

2/10/2022,"Manic Street Preachers were always Guns N’ Roses fans: on A Billion Balconies Facing the Sun, they collaborated with the band’s bassist Duff McKagan. Charmingly perverse as ever, they turned in one of their poppiest latterday melodies, liberally decorated with metal guitar.  The band’s conflicted attitude to mainstream acceptance is given full vent in this Chomsky and Camus-quoting blast of anger that alternately questions and celebrates their recent success in both lyrics and music. With a crowd-pleasing steal from Twist and Shout crashing against raw, dense punk rock, it entered the charts at No 1. A band surveying a vastly altered musical landscape and wondering where – if anywhere – they fit in after 30 years: “There will be no parades for the likes of us … the callous deception of never giving up.” It is so self-interrogating, it answers its own central question: none of their peers would write something like this. The Holy Bible’s oppressive racket appeared to come out of nowhere – unless you had noticed the B-side of Life Becoming a Landslide. It’s all there: a dark sound rooted in the angular guitars of post-punk years before the post-punk revival took hold, a claustrophobic atmosphere amplified by the effects that muffle and compress James Dean Bradfield’s voice during the verses; it breaks into a wounded roar at the chorus: lyrics that hint at anorexia and despair. Recent Manics albums have contained a lot of duets – testament to Bradfield’s acknowledgement that his own voice has limitations – but this, featuring Welsh singer-songwriter Georgia Ruth Williams, may be the best: an icy-sounding, echo-swathed but tender meditation on ageing. If you want to compare the Manics to the Clash – and the early Manics would clearly have been delighted if you did – then Gold Against the Soul is their Give ’Em Enough Rope: an overproduced second album that still contains a handful of potent songs, La Tristessa Durera’s sympathetic depiction of a war veteran among them. Last year’s The Ultra Vivid Lament – a far more focused album than its predecessor, Resistance Is Futile – was heralded by Orwellian, a despairing survey of 21st-century British life that still feels weirdly uplifting thanks to its tune, which perfectly fulfils the band’s stated remit of “the Clash meets Abba”. A song provoked by Nicky Wire looking at his wedding photos and seeing both Richey Edwards and the band’s late manager Philip Hall, Enola / Alone sums up Everything Must Go’s winning sound – melodically rich, “uplifting but melancholy” as Wire put it, plus Wire’s glum brand of post-Edwards positivity: “All I want to do is live, no matter how miserable it is.” Intended for Sylvester Stallone’s disastrous Judge Dredd movie, but rejected – perhaps understandably, given that Edwards’s minimal lyrics are clearly about self-harm – Judge Yr’self is the great lost Holy Bible-era Manics track: powerful, taut, relentless, punishing in a way that Mega City One’s chief law enforcer might appreciate. It eventually surfaced on the 2003 compilation Lipstick Traces. Synthesiser-heavy, death-fixated, described by Nicky Wire as “a withdrawal”, 2004’s Lifeblood – a relative flop on release – has not been given the deluxe reissue treatment afforded most Manics albums. But it deserves reconsidering: beneath its smooth sheen lurk some fabulous songs, as evidenced by the utterly downcast loveliness of Solitude Sometimes Is. At a time when the Manics seemed so anomalous to prevailing alt-rock trends that some observers concluded they must be a joke, this song, according to Martin Kelly of the band’s early label, Heavenly, “showed us, early doors, just how great this band were”. Subdued and subtle, the version on the B-side of You Love Us trumps the flat re-recording on their 1992 debut album, Generation Terrorists. The title track of the (largely) acoustic album the Manic Street Preachers had been discussing making for 20 years is exquisitely lugubrious, making perfect use of guest Richard Hawley’s careworn vocals. The moment when Bradfield’s voice finally appears, backed by soaring strings, is really spectacular. Shocking even 30 years ago, Archives of Pain is a song that’s almost impossible to imagine a mainstream rock band releasing in the current climate. Inspired by Michel Foucault, it argues for the death penalty in visceral terms: “Don’t be ashamed to slaughter … there is never redemption”. The scourging post-punk-meets-metal accompaniment fits perfectly. According to Manics biographer Simon Price, Sleepflower has “almost become a standing joke”: die-hard fans call for it at every gig, but the band usually declines to oblige, reflecting their ambivalence about Gold Against the Soul. But it’s a fan favourite for a reason, its stark drawing of depression set to a killer riff and an arena-sized chorus. Wire has often remarked on the pleasing disjuncture caused by the Manics’ vast success following Edwards’s disappearance, especially the sound of stadium audiences singing along to his agonisingly bleak lyrics. A Top 10 hit, Kevin Carter carries a hint of Holy Bible spikiness in its sound, its Edwards-penned lyrics dark and disturbing. There’s no getting around the fact that William’s Last Words, found among Edwards’s last set of lyrics, reads like a suicide note. The song his bandmates constructed around his words – stately, subtly orchestrated, the sad resignation of the lyrics compounded by Wire’s wavering, untutored voice – is beautiful. In which singer-guitarist Bradfield takes over the job of Manics lyricist, with brave and startling results: a portrait of his mother dying of cancer. Its chorus – a childlike plea for his mum to “stay awake” so they can drink cranberry juice together – perfectly encapsulates desperately clinging to anything in the face of crushing hopelessness. In the context of The Holy Bible, This Is Yesterday almost counts as a mellow moment of respite: Wire’s ambiguous meditation on memory and regret (“The only way to gain approval is by exploiting the very thing that cheapens me,” offers the Manics’ inflammatory quote-machine, ruefully), set to music that deals in subdued yearning. As attention-grabbing early statements go, Motown Junk’s ferocious iconoclasm takes some beating: “All your slut heroes offer is a fear of the future … I laughed when Lennon got shot.” Whether they really meant it is debatable – they dropped the Lennon line from live performances long ago – but as Motown Junk rages along, it hardly matters. In a more straightforward story, 2007’s Send Away the Tigers might have been the follow-up to This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours – harder-edged but still commercial, another multi-platinum smash – and its hook-laden single would have been No 1. But the Manics’ story is never straightforward, which doesn’t stop Your Love Alone, a duet with the Cardigans’ Nina Persson, being a fantastic example of their pop smarts. The Manics Street Preachers’ most commercial phase has been retrospectively reproached, sometimes by the band themselves, but as You Stole the Sun proves, they were genuinely skilled at being a straightforward rock band. It’s a great song: whether the Manics were ever supposed to be a straightforward rock band is another matter. Recorded in tandem with the largely acoustic Rewind the Film album, Futurology was its polar opposite: jagged, electronic, influenced by Krautrock and post-punk’s flirtations with the dancefloor. Let’s Go to War is audibly inspired by both PiL’s Death Disco and John Barry: it sounds both unmistakably like the Manics and like nothing they’d done before. The Holy Bible’s dark, terrifying centre, and the sound, as journalist Dorian Lynskey noted, of guitarist-lyricist Edwards’s “brilliant mind burning itself out”, Of Walking Abortion is an unsparing explosion of moral disgust, in which humanity is deemed worthless, “no one cares and everyone is guilty”. It’s incredibly bold, utterly gripping and desperately sad. Journal for Plague Lovers was a risky project – new songs based on lyrics Edwards had penned before his 1995 disappearance – but it turned out a triumph, a perfect companion piece to The Holy Bible. There is nothing watered-down or middle-aged about Peeled Apples’ broiling din, which one critic compared to being kicked in the head. Originally intended as a B-side, If You Tolerate This … provoked perhaps the most polarised No 1 battle in chart history: the Manic Street Preachers singing about Welsh volunteers in the International Brigades during the Spanish civil war versus Steps’ One for Sorrow. The former won: testament to its infectiously sad sigh of a melody. A rash of wilfully inflammatory music press interviews swiftly made the Manics arguably the most reviled band in Britain. You Love Us is their irresistibly cocky response: amid a string of further provocations, the lyrics brilliantly fix the thorny, symbiotic relationship between artist and music press, set to air-punch-inducing, glam-punk anthemics. Not just the greatest Manics B-side, but one of the greatest Manics songs full stop, Prologue to History sets Wire’s furious torrent of words – an unsparing, accusatory self-portrait that ponders the impact of the Manics mainstream success on “the boy who once had a mission” – to an uncharacteristically piano-led, incredibly potent sound. Motorcycle Emptiness began life as a shambolic 80s indie-inspired track called Go Buzz Baby Go – audibly indebted to the June Brides’ B-side Josef’s Gone – and wound up as the first evidence the Manics could succeed on the kind of scale they kept talking about in interviews: an ambitious, widescreen rock ballad that works perfectly. The Manics’ post-Richey return chimed with the Britpop era: A Design for Life was unashamedly anthemic, ruthlessly effective commercial guitar rock. But in another sense, they were as out of step as ever with the Cool Britannia party: the strings and singalong chorus conceal a righteously furious examination of the British class system’s strictures. From its unyielding, monotone opening to its conclusion – a guitar solo where the notes jut out at odd, discordant angles from the tune, and a chant of “so damn easy to cave in, man kills everything”, Faster is a single that immediately lunges for the throat and refuses to let go. If its lyrics are nowhere near as disturbing as those elsewhere on The Holy Bible, they still inhabit an unsettling space between preaching a particularly ascetic self-reliance and bullishly defending self-harm, with one of Edwards’ most celebrated lines along the way: “I know I believe in nothing, but it’s my nothing”. Furious, shocking, and yet equipped with a singalong chorus: a genuinely extraordinary single.",Arts/Music,Manic Street Preachers’ 30 greatest songs – ranked!,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/10/manic-street-preachers-30-greatest-songs-ranked
2/10/2022,"Pension funds should face legal obligations to bring their investments in line with the net zero greenhouse gas emissions goal, the film-maker Richard Curtis has said. Curtis, a co-founder of the Make My Money Matter campaigning group, urged ministers to follow up the UK’s legal commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050 by making it mandatory for pension schemes to align their portfolios with the target.  He told the Guardian: “The moment has arrived. Why not invest in sustainable investments? We can see the risks of the climate crisis. This is one of the most practical changes possible.” He added that everyone must take responsibility for their impact on the climate crisis. “People can’t say, I will sit this one out. It’s not going to go away. And [making net zero mandatory on pension schemes] is one of the levers of change.” Ministers have been reluctant to make mandatory changes that would affect how companies invest, though at last year’s Cop26 climate summit the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said large companies would have to disclose their exposure to the risks of the climate crisis by 2025. But many campaigners think the mandatory disclosure of climate risk alone does not go far enough, as it does not penalise companies for investing in high-carbon activities. Tony Burdon, the chief executive of Make My Money Matter, said: “The government needs to ensure that net zero is mandatory [on pension schemes] to help trustees. At the moment, some trustees are fearful. They think they might see a legal challenge [if they moved to net zero]. We think just the opposite – that if they do not move to net zero, they could see legal challenges.” If the government made net zero targets mandatory on the pension industry, the default position for advisers would switch to advocating investments with a low carbon footprint, which would have a transformative effect on the UK’s investment landscape, said Burdon. While the UK has had a legally binding target since 2019 to reach net zero by 2050, most pension funds have not shifted their portfolios to reflect this, although many of the people investing in pensions today will be drawing them by 2050. Make My Money Matter estimates that £1.7tn worth of investments in UK pension funds are not yet in line with the goal of holding global temperature rises to 1.5C, the limit targeted by the government at Cop26, and which the net zero target is needed to meet. This includes about 70% of the UK’s largest pension schemes, many of which are older-style final salary schemes. Aligning investments with net zero would be possible for those schemes, Curtis said, pointing to the £1tn of UK pension fund investments that have already shifted to portfolios compatible with a net zero target. “There is a very positive range of options for investors. There are very exciting companies to invest in,” said Curtis, whose films include Love Actually and Four Weddings and a Funeral. “Changing my pension [to ensure it is invested in line with 1.5C] is the biggest change I have made for the climate. It’s 21 times more effective than changing your energy provider.” He said his son had been marching with Fridays for Future, the global movement of young people inspired by Greta Thunberg’s school climate strikes. “I’ve been very inspired by the younger generation’s focus on the climate,” he said. “Weather used to be the last thing on the news – now it’s the first thing on the news.” Curtis said it was vital to talk to young people now about pensions and the impacts they could have on the future of the planet, rather than focus on people nearer to pension age. “It took a lot from my dad to convince me that I should get a pension at all,” he said, but added that younger people were more aware of their future as the evident dangers of climate breakdown had become more obvious, and pensions should be part of this. “Younger people are thinking about their purchases, about the impact of what they do and what they buy, their clothes and their food. Pensions are one of the most effective ways to get change.”",News/Environment,"Force pension funds to align with net zero goal, says Richard Curtis",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/10/force-pension-funds-align-with-net-zero-goal-richard-curtis-climate
2/10/2022,"Good morning. Target is instructing store managers to prevent the retailer’s workers from unionizing, leaked training documents reveal.  The guidelines sent out at the end of January tell managers to look out for warning signs of labor union organizing in their stores. Managers are urged to stamp out union campaigns by working with corporate human resources. The company claims in the training, which was leaked anonymously to the workers’ advocacy group Target Workers Unite, that it isn’t “anti-union” but rather “pro team member and guest” and that unions would not “improve anything – not for our team members, our guests, or the company”. How does the training characterize unions? As “a business that makes money from the dues and fees paid by its members” – but then goes on to say they’re formed when workers join and express the wish to be represented collectively. The leak comes as other US chains including Amazon and Starbucks fight unionization. The House select committee investigating the 6 January insurrection has subpoenaed the former White House senior adviser Peter Navarro as the panel intensifies its inquiry. Navarro is a crucial player: he helped finalize the plot to prevent Joe Biden’s election win from being certified. Investigators want to depose him as they believe he could shed light on what Donald Trump knew in advance of plans to stop the certification. The congressman Bennie Thompson, the chair of the select committee, said in the subpoena letter: “Navarro appears to have information directly relevant to the select committee’s investigation. He hasn’t been shy about his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and has even discussed the former president’s support for those plans.” Why is the move significant? It suggests the panel is close to investigating potential culpability for Trump. When did Navarro discuss 6 January? He has spoken about the events of that day in his book In Trump Time, on his podcast and with reporters. This means he should be free to speak to the panel without legal impediment. Why is he of special interest? Navarro was an influential advisor to Trump while also being in regular contact with the political operatives behind the scheme to stop the certification of Biden’s victory. A third of Americans have detectable levels of a cancer-linked herbicide, a large national study has found. Despite a multitude of environmental and health concerns, including birth defects and hormonal imbalances, farmers have increasingly used the herbicide 2,4-D, according to the study evaluating the footprint of the chemical. Human exposure to the chemical, which can be ingested through the skin, mouth and nose, has risen from a low of 17% in 2001-02 to a high of almost 40% a decade later. Why is exposure rising? 2,4-D was developed in the 1940s, but its popularity fell after farmers and gardeners switched to Roundup (glyphosate). The subsequent emergence of Roundup-resistant weeds has meant industrialised farming has ramped up its used of 2,4-D. Are some groups more affected? Children aged from six to 11 and women of childbearing age had substantially higher levels of 2,4-D in their urine. Cameroonian asylum-seekers deported by Trump administration suffered imprisonment, torture and rape on their return, a Human Rights Watch report has found. Almost all of those deported in 2019 and 2020 faced some kind of reprisal, ranging from having their identity cards confiscated to rape. The US has been accused of racial profiling over the China Initiative, with American academics who used to, or still have, links to China caught up in the geopolitical tension. The attorney general, Merrick Garland, said the Department of Justice was reviewing the program. Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has been mocked after she ranted about “gazpacho police” patrolling the Capitol building in Washington DC. The Georgia congresswoman appeared to have mixed up the Nazi-era secret police with the Spanish cold tomato soup. Comedian Bob Saget’s death was caused by an accidental blow to the head, his family have said. The Full House star was found dead in a Florida hotel room on 9 January. The statement added that no drugs or alcohol were involved. Anti-vaccine protest blockades on the Ambassador Bridge, the busiest border bridge between Canada and the US, risks manufacturers in the region incurring losses of $50m a day. The bridge, which has been targeted by a “freedom convoy” protest triggered by a federal vaccine mandate for truck drivers crossing the Canada-US border, is responsible for 27% of all Canada-US trade. Authorities are increasingly using felony charges as a tactic to hinder protest against pipeline construction, legal advocates have warned. More than a dozen states have passed laws criminalizing fossil fuel protests. Following last summer’s protests against the Line 3 oil pipeline in Minnesota, lawyers warned that authorities were making “very creative use” of felony laws. Record temperatures are forecast for multiple Californian regions from the San Francisco Bay Area to Los Angeles as the state gears up for an unseasonable winter heatwave. Temperatures are predicted to be 15-20F above normal from Wednesday morning through Sunday in southern California, with officials warning that the unusual weather would result in faster dehydration and heat stress.

2/10/2022,"Rightwing MPs in southern Spain have ignored protests from the central government, the EU, Unesco and several ecological groups by voting to grant an amnesty to illegal strawberry farmers who have been tapping water from the aquifer that feeds one of Europe’s largest protected wetlands. On Wednesday afternoon, the Andalucían regional parliament approved the proposal, which will “regularise” 1,461 hectares (3610 acres) of land near the Doñana national park, thereby allowing farmers who have sunk illegal wells and built illicit plantations on the land to legitimise their operations.  The controversial proposal was brought by the conservative People’s party (PP), which governs the region, and backed by the centre-right Citizens party and the far-right Vox party. The regional branch of Spain’s ruling Socialist Workers’ party abstained, while its national coalition partner, Unidas Podemos, opposed the move. The regional president, Juan Manuel Moreno of the PP, has defended the planned legislation, claiming it would allow the authorities to more closely monitor the tapping that has been going on for years. “No one should think that we’re going to erode our natural jewels by as much as a millimetre,” Moreno said last month. “We’re going to protect it because that’s what the law tells us to do, and because that’s what we want to do.” Such comments, however, have done little to convince opponents of the plan. SEO BirdLife, the Spanish ornithological society, described Wednesday’s vote as “another step towards Doñana’s extinction”, while WWF Spain said it would use all the resources at its disposal to fight “this mortal blow to the already over-exploited aquifer that gives Doñana life”. On Tuesday, Spain’s minister for the ecological transition, Teresa Ribera, wrote to Moreno, saying the mooted amnesty risked damaging Spain’s international image, undermining efforts to tackle the climate emergency, and could result in the EU taking costly legal action. “Given the enormous harm, both economic and environmental – not to mention the damage to Spain’s image abroad – I … call on you to abandon this process before the Andalucían parliament, which could prove so damaging for Spain,” wrote Ribera. Water supplies to Doñana, where marshes, forests and dunes extend across almost 130,000 hectares in the provinces of Huelva, Seville and Cádiz, have declined drastically over the past 30 years because of climate change, farming, mining pollution and marsh drainage. Doñana is visited by millions of migrating birds each year and is also home to a major population of endangered Iberian lynxes. In 2013, Unesco – which declared the national park a world heritage site in 1994 – said that treasured status could be lost if efforts were not made to crack down on illegal water extraction to feed strawberry farms. The UN agency has already asked the Spanish government for an urgent report on the amnesty “before any decisions are taken that might be difficult to reverse”. Soft fruit farms play a huge role in the local economy. Between January and June last year, Huelva’s exports of soft fruit – almost 20% of which are to the UK – were worth €801.3m (£678m).",News/World news,Amnesty granted to illegal Spanish strawberry farmers despite protests over damage to wetlands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/protests-over-wetlands-after-amnesty-vote-for-spanish-strawberry-farmers
2/10/2022,"The last couple of years have seen flower fans branch out (pun intended), with plant and bulb sales booming during the pandemic. Yet, when it comes to Valentine’s Day, traditional red roses can be harder to resist than the lure of a forbidden love affair. A dozen of these long-stemmed flowers might once have signalled the height of romance, but after a quick look at the environmental impact they don’t smell quite as sweet for UK-based buyers. So how can you make sure you are giving an ethical bunch on 14 February?  Due to Britain’s climate, the vast majority of roses sold in this country during the early months of the year are imported. Most come from Kenya, where it is warm enough for them to grow naturally, or the Netherlands, where they are grown under artificial heat and light. Around 8m stems (570 tonnes) are imported via Heathrow alone during February – about three times as many as any other month, leading to a carbon footprint of around 30kg of CO2 for a mixed bouquet of 11 Kenyan and Dutch stems. They are often sold at a loss, in the hope that customers will buy other, more expensive items as they shop. “We do a lot of work in events, and often we would find there was a huge disconnect,” says Olivia Wilson, co-founder of SSAW Collective, a community of chefs, florists and growers, who are urging buyers to take a seasonal approach to flowers. “Sustainable sourcing of the food menu would be considered, but the tables would be covered with imported flowers.” Valentine’s Day is perhaps the biggest culprit when it comes to shopping out of season. “It is one of the most significant events in the floristry calendar but it’s very stark in February,” says Wilson. “When you look outside and see what is growing naturally, it definitely doesn’t look anything like traditional rose bouquets.” As with food, supporting local businesses is often the best option. “Once flowers are flown into the country, they are usually transported around the UK in huge refrigerated vehicles, which also have an impact on the environment,” says Alison Down, ​​a flower farmer at Boho Flowers, Hertfordshire. “From cutting to customer, it can take a week.” If you want to say it with flowers, roses are not your only option. “A lot of Cornish growers have narcissi available by February, especially the bridal crown and paperwhite [daffodil] varieties,” says Jess Geissendorfer, who also co-founded SSAW Collective. In addition, she recommends snowdrops, cyclamen, quince and winter-flowering blossoms as alternatives to roses. “I’ve seen a shift to tulips and early spring bulbs,” says Debra Prinzing, founder of the Slow Flowers Society and author of books including The 50 Mile Bouquet. “Other gift ideas are also gaining popularity, such as flower subscription services – so you give the certificate to your sweetheart now, but maybe the first delivery doesn’t arrive until May.” SSAW Collective’s own subscription service launches this month, offering sustainable flowers on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis. “Last year we provided seasonal spring bouquets for Valentine’s Day, grown in the UK without pesticides and not wrapped in plastic,” says Down. “You could have hellebores, narcissi, hyacinths, tulips, anemones and alstroemeria – you can get all those from UK growers. We also use lots of dried grasses, contorted hazel and willow (they’re like wiggly sticks with little catkins), lots of eucalyptus and evergreen foliage.” Bloom & Wild, the online postal florist, is forgoing red roses on Valentine’s Day for the second year running. “We ran a survey and found that 58% of people thought roses were a cliche,” says Charlotte Langley, VP of brand and communications. “From a sustainability point of view, this also meant we had no bouquet wastage last year. Historically, we’d seen double-digit wastage on red rose bouquets because the demand drops off so dramatically after Valentine’s Day.” You don’t need to look far to know that dried flowers are all the rage. “Some farmers are growing flowers specifically to dry, cutting them at the right time so that they retain that colour, and a lot of them have that pink/red Valentine’s Day palette,” says Prinzing. “I know someone who is teaching a wreath workshop for Valentine’s using all dried flowers, showcasing them in a new way.” Being long-lasting, dried flowers also help to minimise waste, which leads us to … Or, at least, what should you do when your ethical posy wilts? “A lot of flowers dry well by being hung upside down,” says Wilson. “Tulips make excellent confetti and spring flowers press really nicely. You don’t need a flower press; you can do it using blotting paper and books.” Langley advises: “If you’re not feeling crafty then it’s best to pop them in your compost or garden waste bin, rather than in your normal bin, otherwise they would be sent to landfill.” Opting for imported blooms is not the only pitfall for shoppers when choosing a bouquet for their valentine. “You also want to think about packaging,” says Langley. “Our letterbox packaging has been 100% recyclable for a long time but we’ve now moved our flower food from plastic to paper sachets and we’re working on swapping bubble wrap for cardboard vase protectors and using compostable moisture bags.” “Another major sustainability issue is the conventional green florists’ foam,” says Prinzing. “It’s single-use plastic, which doesn’t break down in landfill. Giving flowers which use an alternative shows your recipient that you care about the environment.” Aside from eschewing roses, there are other things to look out for if you want to be sure you’re picking an ethical posy. “Pesticide use is incredibly harmful for the environments where flowers are grown en masse and for the people working with them,” says Wilson. “We’re really passionate about improving labelling because it’s difficult for florists to always know where their flowers are coming from, and what chemicals have been used to grow them.” Down agrees that better labelling would also make it much easier for customers to identify ethical bouquets. “You want to see that they are fair trade and organic,” she says. If you’re not buying directly from a local grower, then it’s worth considering how the businesses you buy from have committed to supporting local communities. “Do a little bit more research into where flowers come from,” says Geissendorfer. “Search online for what’s available in your local area; it’s really rewarding to build relationships with small independent businesses.” A little research can go a long way when buying from bigger floristry businesses, too. “If a company is taking their responsibility to the environment and the community seriously, they should be able to show that; check out their credentials before buying,” advises Langley. “Are they thinking deeply about issues across the whole spectrum, from sourcing to delivery and packaging? Are they offsetting emissions and working on a plan to get to net zero?” Lastly, get into the habit of seeking out seasonal produce. “By summer, you can get a bouquet that’s full of variety, grown entirely in the UK. There really is no need to import anything,” says Wilson. “It’s important to think about flowers in the same way you might fruit and veg: strawberries in December would feel a little odd.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Roses are dead … how to choose a more ethical and original bouquet this Valentine’s Day,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/10/roses-ethical-original-bouquet-valentines-day-pesticide-love-eco-friendly
2/10/2022,"My sister, Kate Mitchell, who has died aged 42 in suspicious circumstances in Kenya, was a development worker with BBC World Media Action, the BBC’s development charity. Kate was born in North Shields in Tyne and Wear, to Rodney Mitchell and his wife, Sue (nee Kennedy), who were both teachers. Our parents were keen outdoors enthusiasts, and most of our early, happy childhood holidays were spent on camping trips or sailing in the North Sea from our base in Whitley Bay, where we lived. However, our father died after a long illness when Kate was 10, and our mother was left to bring up two young children on her own.  Although Kate’s intelligence could command any room, she never believed she was clever: her attendance at Marden high school in North Shields was scanty, and she never took A-levels. She then spent much of her time up to her late 20s being offered permanent jobs and turning them down – out of a desire to travel, an unwillingness to be tied down and a basic restlessness that was to define her life. In London in the late 2000s, she finally found herself working for the BBC Trust and was then seconded to World Media Action, where she was to stay for the 14 years until her death, first working in London and then increasingly overseas: in Lusaka, Zambia, as a project officer; for two years in Juba, south Sudan, as deputy country director, and then in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as a project manager. At the time of her death she had been moved to Nairobi as a temporary security measure due to the ongoing conflict in Ethiopia, and had done so only under protest: characteristically, she had wanted to stay with her Ethiopian colleagues, doing the work she loved. While working full-time and between countries, Kate had taken up education again, and completed a degree in social sciences through the University of London extramural course, followed by an MA in development studies at Birkbeck, University of London. Wherever she lived was always full of books, and she travelled constantly and with a consuming curiosity. Her greatest talent was for friendship. She was bottomlessly interested in other people and quietly attentive to their needs: she is remembered at the BBC as unfailingly generous with her time, expertise and support. She also volunteered widely, with organisations that helped refugees and homeless people, and at womens’ shelters. Since her death we have continued to hear stories about her often extravagant acts of kindness and solidarity – many dating back decades – to which, with characteristic self-effacement, she never drew attention. Although Kate’s career was clearly taking off at the time she died, she was resistant to pursuing higher-paying managerial jobs since she was happiest in the field, engaging with development partners and gaining an intimate knowledge of the countries and cultures she lived in. She is survived by her partner, John Marks, her mother and me.",News/Media,Kate Mitchell obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/10/kate-mitchell-obituary
