4/28/2022,"Britain’s trade talks with the US are moving ahead with only “minimal” input from workers, small businesses and thinktanks, according to MPs who accused the UK trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, of shielding her department from outside scrutiny. Conservative and Labour MPs on the trade select committee also said scrutiny of a deal struck with Australia and New Zealand was in danger of being “rushed through” parliament before they could make an assessment of its impact on imports and exports to and from the Commonwealth countries. The row came after two days of talks between Trevelyan and the US trade envoy, Katherine Tai, in Aberdeen this week. It is understood the talks amounted to little more than “exploratory conversations”, according to officials close to the talks. Officials on both sides discussed the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the global trade system before moving on to talk about on the “principles” governing a potential deal between the UK and US. The US is the UK’s single largest export destination and UK-US total trade was valued at more than £220bn in 2020. A UK-US free trade agreement could increase trade between both countries by more than £15bn “in the long run”, according to government projections. Talks have been in progress for more than 18 months against a backdrop of increasing scepticism that a deal can be agreed by the US Congress. Speaking on Wednesday following a conference on trade, Adam Posen, a former Bank of England policymaker and head of the Washington-based Peterson Institute, said there was little chance of a deal between the UK and the US while the Good Friday agreement, which secured peace in Northern Ireland, remained in jeopardy. “The US Congress doesn’t want to approve any trade deals of any kind with anybody,” Posen told Bloomberg. “Then you throw in Northern Ireland. This is not going to happen, 100%.” MPs are concerned that any proposals will downgrade workers’ rights, despite promises on both sides. The US president has pledged to protect workers’ rights as part of any trade deal and his officials have included equal numbers of representatives from business and unions on trade advisory boards. Joe Biden is known to question trade deals that just cut tariffs and make goods and services exports easier, arguing that it has failed to benefit living standards in a majority of nations, including industrialised areas of the US. Trevelyan said the TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, was involved in talks in Aberdeen and she expected unions to play a role in advising the government on future trade deals. But she was unable to say if there would be representation for unions, small businesses and independent experts on all groups, adding that she wanted to be flexible and “fleet-of-foot” in how she approached trade talks. Labour MPs on the trade committee accused the trade secretary of a “top-down” approach that excluded a range of voices, heightening the risk of ministers signing deals harmful to domestic industries. Lloyd Russell-Moyle, the Labour MP for Brighton, Kemptown, accused Trevelyan of refusing to follow the US and the EU, which included equal numbers of businesses and unions on advisory committees, after it was revealed that the UK had only included unions on six out of 21. Shevaun Haviland , the head of the British Chambers of Commerce, has yet to be appointed to an advisory group, denying the lobby group’s mostly small and medium-sized businesses high-level representation. Trevelyan, who expects a US trade deal to improve the wages of British workers, said: “We are getting great input from all these sectoral groups. Everything is in an agile form, and we are looking to include a mix of expertise. There are six where we have invited unions and we continue to look across the piece for advice to make sure my team have the best people to advise them.” Rosa Crawford, the TUC’s trade policy lead, said: “The TUC has been waiting nearly 18 months for the government to agree to all our nominations for the trade advisory groups. “If the government seriously wants a ‘worker-centred’ approach to trade deals it shouldn’t be dragging its feet on trade union representation. It should be ensuring all unions with an industrial base in the sectors covered by the groups are represented.”",News/Business,MPs criticise ‘top-down’ approach to UK-US trade talks,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/mps-criticise-top-down-approach-to-uk-us-trade-talks
4/28/2022,"Daniel Challis was born and brought up near Walsall, surrounded by family members with distinctive regional accents. Yet the communication aid he uses to speak with sounds nothing like them, instead vocalising in a robotic version of received pronunciation. The 18-year-old, who has cerebral palsy and is unable to speak, is appealing for people to audition to provide his new voice – providing they have the right accent. “I feel uncomfortable when using my current voice and I want to sound like people around me,” said Challis. “It’s very important to me because if I wasn’t disabled, I would not be using a computer to communicate.” He was inspired to launch his appeal by the comedian and Britain’s Got Talent winner Lee Ridley, known by his stage name Lost Voice Guy, who last year changed the voice on his speech app to a geordie accent. “When you look at Lee speaking with that accent, it’s like it’s part of him,” said his mother, Sarah Challis. “I think Daniel just wants the same, to sound like the people around him, like he should have sounded. He would have gone to the local school and would have picked up a local accent, but he’s got this robotic one instead.” Challis, who is a huge Harry Potter fan, has asked anyone interested to send in an audio clip of themselves reading the first few lines of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. He will then whittle them down to a shortlist before deciding who he thinks is the best fit. “It’s about finding what he believes he sounds like, because it might be different to what I think,” said Sarah. “I’m being quite open because I think he’s got to be able to choose whatever he wants.” The chosen person will have to spend a number of hours in a recording studio in order for their voice to be captured in enough detail to be loaded on to the speech programme. “It’s a long process so whoever gives Daniel their voice is obviously also giving their time to create that voice. Whoever that is, it’s going to be really special to Dan,” said Sarah. “I think it might sound quite weird if they were able to meet afterwards and both talk together.” Challis said he thought his new voice “will feel strange to start with and will take time to get used to, but it will feel amazing”. He lives with his family in the town of Aldridge, just north-east of Walsall, and said he was looking for a local accent and “a more natural voice that fits me”. The communication aid he uses to speak operates using eye-gaze technology, meaning he selects letters, words and common phrases using his eyes, which are then converted into spoken sentences. “There must be people all over the country that have all got communication aids, that maybe all want to look at having their own accent and their own identities,” Sarah said. “Daniel is going to residential college in September, where there are going to be people from different parts of the country, and he wants to sound like he comes from where he comes from, and not a robot.”",News/UK news,‘I want a voice that fits me’: teenager’s quest for communication aid with Walsall accent,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/27/voice-that-fits-me-teenagers-quest-communication-aid-walsall-accent
4/28/2022,"Emma Raducanu believes she is on the right track as she continues to adjust to life on tour despite describing her decision to part from her coach, Torben Beltz, this week as “tough”. Raducanu said her decision to move on from Beltz was a reflection of the comfort she has found on the court during their work together rather than a failure of their partnership. “Torben is a very great guy,” she said during her pre-tournament press conference at the Madrid Open. “I really enjoyed my time with him on and off the court. He is one of the nicest people I’ve met so it was a tough one to split with someone like that, but I feel like right now I’m very comfortable with my current training and how I’m training.” A third coaching split in 10 months has drawn further attention to Raducanu’s unconventional perspective towards coaching, with she and her father favouring short transactions with coaches, learning from them and then seeking out new information elsewhere. Raducanu says that her experiences this year have helped her to understand her needs. “Going forward I’ll probably be putting a lot more emphasis on sparring,” she said, reported by the Daily Mail. “It is becoming more apparent to me as I spend more time on the tour is just getting used to these girls’ ball speed. I felt like in my quarter-final match (against world No 1 Iga Swiatek in Stuttgart), I was just trying to get used to the ball speed in the first few games and had a bit of a slow start because of that.” After a torrid beginning to 2022 with various injuries and first-round losses, Raducanu won her debut Billie Jean King Cup match in Britain’s narrow defeat by the Czech Republic and then she reached her first WTA 500 quarter-final in Stuttgart. Riccardo Piatti remains the clear favourite to work with Raducanu next after she trained at his prominent academy ahead of the clay court season. In her first-round match, Raducanu will face Tereza Martincova in Madrid, who she defeated in the Billie Jean King Cup. The quick conditions at altitude in Madrid are unlike most clay court tournaments, allowing players to play as they would on hard court and they are likely to suit Raducanu’s game more than most other events on the surface. “I really don’t care how many times I’m losing in the first round,” she said. “To me it doesn’t mean anything right now because I’m actually enjoying the journey of picking myself back up and working through things.” Earlier on Wednesday, Swiatek announced her withdrawal from Madrid, citing a shoulder injury and fatigue in the midst of a breakthrough run during which she has won 23 matches in a row and four consecutive tournaments.",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu reflects on ‘tough’ choice to split with coach Torben Beltz,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/27/emma-raducanu-reflects-on-tough-choice-to-split-with-coach-torben-beltz
4/28/2022,"Steadily, ominously, the stakes are rising in the confrontation that Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine has provoked with the west. Russia’s state energy company Gazprom halted gas supplies to two EU member states – Poland and Bulgaria – on Wednesday and warned that more countries could be similarly targeted. Poland, with good reason, described this as a “direct attack”. Moscow is also talking darkly of delivering a “proportionate response” to the demonisation of Russia by western governments. On Tuesday, Mr Putin’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused Nato of “engaging in a war with Russia through a proxy”. The risk of nuclear escalation, he said, was becoming “considerable”. Economic warfare and apocalyptic threats can be read as signs of Russia’s bitter frustration at the way events have unfolded since February. The scale and practical value of western solidarity with Ukraine – in the form of sanctions, financial aid and military assistance – have come as an unpleasant surprise to the Kremlin. The humiliating failure of Mr Putin’s initial plan to capture Kyiv and topple the Ukrainian government was down to the bravery and skill of those who fought to defend their country. But external military assistance was crucial in giving the country’s armed forces sufficient means to resist. As the focus of the Kremlin’s campaign shifts to the eastern Donbas region and southern Ukraine, that support is continuing and adapting to the likely circumstances of a more attritional phase of the war. The US has announced a £600m package of military and financial aid that will include more advanced western weapons as well as non-Nato ammunition for Soviet-made tanks and artillery. Britain has indicated that it may send howitzers and anti-aircraft systems. Despite a previous reluctance to directly supply heavy weaponry, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has now approved the delivery of German tanks to Ukraine, though it is unclear how soon they will be usable. Helping Ukraine defend itself is the right thing to do. But as the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, calls for western powers to escalate intervention still further and provide fighter jets to Ukraine, Mr Scholz’s initial reservations are worth recalling. In an interview with Der Spiegel, he argued that “everything must be done to avoid a direct military confrontation between Nato and a highly armed superpower like Russia”. So far, the west has managed to balance caution and assistance to good effect, emphasising the defensive nature of the support it has offered Kyiv. But there are some signs, rhetorically at least, of needless escalation. In a press conference earlier this week, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, appeared to expand Washington’s objectives beyond the defence of Ukraine to weakening Russia’s capacity for future aggression and strengthening Nato. Already implicit in America’s actions, this would have been best left unsaid. Equally, to “double down” in the way Ms Truss proposes would ratchet up the risks in a context that is becoming more, not less, volatile – as recent explosions in Transnistria, a pro-Russian separatist region of Moldova, testify. If the UK goes down this path, it should only be after the fullest consultation with parliament and an honest public debate about the dilemmas and uncertainties involved. Russia’s nuclear threats are a sign of the Kremlin’s desperation, but they also illustrate the frighteningly high stakes in the most serious conflict on European soil since the second world war.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on war in Ukraine: the stakes rise higher | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/27/the-guardian-view-on-war-in-ukraine-the-stakes-rise-higher
4/28/2022,"Announcing his £35bn ($44bn) acquisition of Twitter this week, Elon Musk made a typically sweeping claim: “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.” The self-described “free speech absolutist” now owns a platform where those views will probably shape the experience of its 400 million users and possibly wider society. His position deserves serious examination. Put into practice, the website might find itself going back to the future. A decade ago, Twitter executives described it as “the free speech wing of the free speech party”. That was an era in which protesters in the Arab spring tweeted against their authoritarian rulers and when wannabes gained notoriety for directing vile racist and sexist abuse against others often more famous. From MPs to female actors in Ghostbusters, the hate brigaders had many targets and met pitifully few obstructions. It took until December 2017 for the platform to boot off the American Nazi party and other white supremacists, months after the lethal Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Painfully slowly, the platform had finally learned that its policy of letting people say pretty much whatever they liked created an environment that millions didn’t like. It dismayed users and repelled advertisers. The very views that have helped make Mr Musk such a popular user of Twitter (86 million followers and rising) will be useless to him as its owner. Take one of the billionaire’s tweets from this week, which reads in part: “By ‘free speech’, I simply mean that which matches the law. I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law.” Sounds reasonable, but in practice it is unworkable. In the US, for instance, it most likely means opening the door to look-at-me provocateurs and the far right. It means Make Twitter Toxic Again. But in Saudi Arabia and China, on the other hand, following the letter of the free-speech laws will turn the platform into a barren wasteland. In both cases, pointing to the first amendment gets you nowhere. This isn’t rocket science – which is a shame because Mr Musk is a rocket scientist. At SpaceX and Tesla, he has proven himself a brilliant engineer. But his views on ethics and politics are clearly work in progress. Put alongside the much larger Facebook, Twitter cannot match its armies of moderators and advisers and independent experts. And yet both platforms are running into ever more significant regulatory headwinds. Westminster is introducing what the government describes as the world’s first online safety laws. Not far behind is Brussels, where the European Commission has launched a declaration on digital rights that calls for technology firms to “respect people’s rights, enable their exercise and promote inclusion”. Those last two words are crucial. For all that social media firms boast of providing a public good, they have hardly thought about debate in terms that go beyond banning the most obnoxious participants. They are often little more than competitions of who shouts loudest for longest. If these huge ethical, political and social issues are left to a tiny bunch of American billionaire media owners and their well-paid advisers to arbitrate, social media will always fail to live up to the promise of being a global digital commons. When Donald Trump was hoicked off Twitter and Facebook, Mr Musk tweeted: “A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech.” Fair point then, fair point now.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Twitter: when free speech costs a bomb | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/27/the-guardian-view-on-twitter-when-free-speech-costs-a-bomb
4/28/2022,"Attempts to oust school governors who supported a visit by a gay author left staff and pupils “feeling angry, confused and frustrated”, Ofsted said. Ofsted said its snap inspection of John Fisher school in Purley was triggered by concerns over the school’s governance, after the Catholic leaders of the archdiocese intervened to cancel a visit by the author Simon James Green to celebrate World Book Day in March. Green was to speak and sign books at the boys’ secondary school, which is overseen by the Catholic archdiocese of Southwark. But the diocese banned the event after overruling the school’s leaders, saying it would “fall outside the scope of what is permissible in a Catholic school” and was “potentially offensive to parents, past pupils and wider members of the Catholic community”. The Ofsted inspector described in detail the archdiocese’s attempts to remove the school governors, who voted to go ahead with Green’s visit, saying that the archdiocese acted “unilaterally” and without regard to statutory guidance. “It is essential that all parties take swift and suitable steps to finalise suitable governance arrangements, and in turn ensure that the governing body can function fully and effectively,” the report states. Ofsted said that as a priority, “immediate steps must be taken to restore stability to governance, and in turn ensure that leadership is provided with the support and challenge needed to build further on the school’s strong provision for pupils’ personal development”. The report said that the events “have unnerved and upset many in the school community. Some leaders, staff and pupils have been left feeling angry, confused and frustrated. Others are worried about the impression these events might give of the school’s ethos”. Members of the National Education Union at John Fisher school are to go on strike from Thursday in protest at the Southwark archdiocese’s actions, with six days of strike action. The Ofsted inspection report reserved its praise for the school’s leaders and teachers, telling headteacher Philip McCullagh: “You and your team are steering the school well through this difficult time.” The inspection also praised the school’s efforts to allow pupils to discuss sensitive issues such as racist or intolerant attitudes. “Relationships and sex education is comprehensive and meets the expectations set out in government guidance. Pupils are taught the importance of respect for all, including those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,” the report stated. “Staff ensure that pupils feel confident in raising and talking about potentially sensitive topics, for instance those related to pornography, sexting and harmful sexual behaviour.”",News/Education,Ofsted criticises archdiocese over ban on gay author’s visit to Catholic school,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/27/ofsted-criticises-archdiocese-over-ban-on-gay-authors-visit-to-catholic-school
4/28/2022,"It was the last prime minister’s questions of the current parliament and the last before next week’s local elections. So it was no real surprise that this session was rather more bloodless than many encounters in recent weeks. Even the Tory frontbench was decidedly a C-list event. All the big cabinet names had wisely decided not to turn up. This was an occasion for party leaders to go through the motions – to secure their greatest hits soundbites – before battle resumes again in a fortnight’s time. But even a relatively low-wattage Keir Starmer can comfortably get the better of Boris Johnson these days. The Convict has become little more than a self-parody. The Fool’s Fool. The Labour leader began with a brief reference to the claims that Angela Rayner had tried to distract Johnson by crossing and uncrossing her legs. Johnson insisted the Mail on Sunday story was untrue. No one cared more about eliminating sexist and misogynistic behaviour than he did. And when he caught up with the Boris Johnson who had described female athletes as wet otters and had suggested that patting women on the bottom was totally OK, he’d give him a piece of his mind. Rayner decided to let it go at that and gave the prime minister a cursory nod. Thereafter Starmer used all of his six questions on the cost of living. How was it that the UK was predicted to have the lowest growth of any nation in the G20, other than Russia? And what was the government proposing to do to prevent inflation from spiralling even further out of control? The country was in a total mess and the only plan the Tories appeared to have was to change the MOT laws. This was a government that had so badly run out of ideas that it was relying on Grant Shapps to bail it out (having presumably already raided the brains of Priti Patel). The Convict could only splutter, shouting out random words, only some of which made sense. A few backbenchers loyally tried to cheer him on, but most just looked a bit embarrassed. Predictably, the rants were laden with lies. Time and again Johnson has been asked to correct his assertions that there are 500,000 more people in work under his government. Yet he said it again. Compulsively. Needily. Shamelessly. It was untrue. If you take in the self-employed then unemployment has gone up by 600,000. But Johnson is just blind to this. He continues to use the figures he wants. As if he is entitled to a truth of his own choosing. This was the 10th time he had repeated the figure in the Commons chamber. The Convict also claimed that the country would still be under lockdown if Labour were in government. So palpably untrue that no one bothered to dispute it. That’s how Johnson rolls. One lie after another, until the boundaries between truth and fiction dissolve. Where everything exists only as moral relativism. That’s how Boris has justified his lies about Partygate. The events took place only in his own imaginary universe for which he alone is judge and jury. “This must be the Oxford Union debating skills we’ve heard so much about,” said Starmer. Scorn is a useful addition to his PMQs armoury. Not so much a coherent argument from the Convict as a word salad. What the present government had to offer made the cones hotline look like a work of genius. In reply, Johnson could only describe the Labour leader as man “doomed to be a permanent spectator”. It sounded more like Boris’s next, enforced, hubristic career move. Things became rather more uncomfortable for the Convict when Caroline Lucas pointed out that 56 MPs, including three cabinet ministers, were under investigation for alleged sexual harassment. Was that grounds for dismissal under the ministerial code, she asked. Even if lying and bullying apparently weren’t. She might also have included the minister whom female Tory MPs had reported to the chief whip for watching porn on his phone in the Commons. Just think how stupid you have to be to do that in a place where you can be observed from almost every angle? And televised. Actually, scrub that. It’s only too easy to imagine some MPs being dim enough to think they could get away with it. Or not even being aware of the risks. A triumph of antiwokeism. Or just getting on with the job in hand. As it were. Johnson sounded far from convincing as he said everyone found guilty would be fired. First off, he would be left with plenty of gaps in government, and second, he’s hardly the person to lecture anyone on sexual propriety. The Convict was the man who had sneaked off work as London mayor for pole dancing lessons. Though he had, at least, done that in the privacy of someone else’s home. The rest of the session rather petered out, though not before Johnson had further embarrassed himself. Were he self-aware enough to be capable of shame. First he remarked that it was odd that the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, wasn’t in the Commons to represent his constituents. This from a man who has literally done everything in the past week to avoid scrutiny from fellow MPs. He followed up by lying about when he had known that Covid could be transmitted asymptomatically. To deny responsibility for 20,000 care home deaths in March and April 2020, when China had been warning about asymptomatic transmission as early as January, was shabby even by his standards. Come the end, Michael Fabricant stood up to make a point of order. He wanted it on record how thrilled he was to have been included on a list of 287 MPs – some of them no longer MPs – who had just been sanctioned by the Russian government. Nothing he had ever done before in his life had given him such self-worth. The rest of us thought this was the most sensible thing the Russians had done in years.

4/28/2022,"It’s still good to talk but increasingly BT customers are doing it wherever they like via connected mobile devices, rather than fixed line broadband and old-fashioned telephones. In recognition of this generational shift, BT quietly announced in a blog post on Wednesday that after more than 30 years and some of the UK’s highest-profile ad campaigns, its flagship consumer brand is to take a back seat to upstart EE in its marketing strategy. The company, which came into being as British Telecom in 1980 when it was still part of the Post Office and adopted BT as its name and corporate brand in 1991, said it was evolving the way it markets to consumers to focus on using the EE identity. The company, which stressed that the BT brand is not being retired, said it will play an “important but more focused role” for consumer customers who have standalone broadband and landline services. EE will now take centre stage, not only for mobile services but bundles that include superfast broadband. “Having both BT and EE in an already over-crowded consumer market means we must have two of everything, and that makes life harder for our customers and our people,” said Marc Allera, chief executive of BT Consumer, in the blog post. “We need to simplify things. From today, we’re starting the preparations to make the EE brand our flagship brand for consumer customers focusing on convergence and future services.” The BT brand will also continue to be used for BT Sport, the pay-TV service set to become part of a joint venture with Warner Bros Discovery, and become the flagship brand for its business-to-business and global operations. BT will also remain as a co-brand on the company’s 550 high street stores and appear in ad campaigns. BT is one of the biggest advertisers in the UK with media industry sources estimating that the company spent more than £150m on all forms of marketing for its BT, EE and Plusnet brands in the last year. Over the years its TV advertising campaigns have featured the late Bob Hoskins, telling viewers “It’s good to talk” in the 1990s; and more recently Hollywood stars including Jeremy Renner, Alex Baldwin and Ryan Reynolds. EE, which BT acquired for £12.5bn in 2016, has existed as a brand since 2012 after it was formed from the merger of France’s Orange and Germany’s T-Mobile. Kester Mann, director of consumer and connectivity at CCS Insight, says that the shift in focus represents a failure to transition the BT brand to tech-savvy consumers. “Running two major consumer brands was never something BT could continue indefinitely,” he said. “For the BT brand, the announcement represents a failure to resonate with the UK’s increasingly technology-savvy consumers. EE appears better equipped to spearhead the next chapter for BT’s Consumer business as it looks to bring new products and services to market beyond traditional connectivity.” BT, which has 20 million broadband, phone, TV and landline customers, said that the EE brand has “captured the hearts of consumers across all demographics … with a strong brand that can stretch into new areas”.",News/Business,BT unveil plans to make EE its consumer-facing brand,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/bt-unveil-plans-to-make-ee-its-consumer-facing-brand
4/28/2022,"Susie Dee’s first work at Melbourne’s La Mama theatre was as a student in the 1970s, acting in a piece called Mangoes and Grapes. Those were the only words in the script, and the play was staged in the car park. It was a heady time for Melbourne theatre. In a scene long dominated by works from the United States and the UK, a new generation of artists were bringing an Australian sensibility and vernacular to the stage. La Mama was based on the New York institution of the same name, and out of it came the Pram Factory: a hot-bed of artistic experimentation, and a home to young artists including David Williamson, Max Gillies and Helen Garner. Dee has now accrued a 40 odd-year career as one of Australia’s most respected theatre directors. Her work has travelled Australia and the world, but she has always returned to her home town. She has a particular affinity with the city’s playwrights, and she is in the final stages of rehearsals of a new Melbourne play, #NoExemptions. Looking back at her first experiences, she remembers the time as “bold and Australian and crude”. After graduating, Dee became part of the 1980s alternative cabaret scene. With her peers (“hundreds of us” she says), she would go around to now-lost venues like Last Laugh. The shows were political and dark, with “a touch of the European clown”. She worked with the then burgeoning Circus Oz, and was interested in bringing a “darker” aesthetic to her work. But it was a role in a 1986 production that would shape Australian theatre for decades to come: Lilly and May, a new show at La Mama by the young playwright Patricia Cornelius, who starred with Dee in the two-hander. Today, Dee and Cornelius are nearly synonymous as a theatre-making duo, making urgent productions which highlight Australia’s working class, giving voice to characters rarely highlighted on Australian stages. Savages, which won four 2013 Green Room awards, looked at the violent masculinity among four men on a cruise ship; writing about 2016’s Animal, the Age called their partnership “ferocious, urgent and strikingly original”. In 2019, they were the first Australians to ever be programmed in the Venice Biennale’s theatre program, with two productions: Shit and Love. But back in 1986, Dee remembers, “it was raw”. “[Lilly and May] was just the two of us with a pram and a cassette player and one lighting state,” she says. “And that little play at La Mama, it ended up travelling the world,” with seasons in Ireland, New York, Canada, and at Edinburgh fringe, where it was named one of the “top shows” of 1988. “If we didn’t do [Lilly and May], our careers would be very different to this day,” Dee says. “Our relationship, our bond, was formed.” It was Cornelius who first suggested Dee should direct one of her plays a few years later. It was also Cornelius who invited Dee to work at Melbourne Workers Theatre, a company originally focused on performing Australian stories in workplaces during lunch hours, “not just in theatres for middle-class people”. “Suddenly I wanted to tell different stories; I wanted to dig a bit deeper into the Australian psyche,” Dee says. Cornelius says Dee makes work that “takes your breath away. Never sentimental. Only vital, full of an amazing life force.” But Dee’s creative network extends far beyond this one relationship. “When you get older, you build a coterie of artists that you connect with,” the director says of her frequent collaborators, which also include Brian Lipson, Angus Cerini and Nicci Wilks. “You have a similar language, a similar politic. We’re never complacent with each other. We can speak our minds; you can be honest.” It is difficult to define Dee’s output. She has worked with dozens of playwrights and hundreds of artists, shifting between theatre spaces and site-specific works; between tiny, independent spaces like La Mama and TheatreWorks, and big stages like Arts Centre Melbourne’s Playhouse, where she directed Anthem in 2019. But there are constants. There is a simmering anger at the state of the world; there is the power of the actor’s body – “a bold, vital production [with] the actor at the core”, as she describes it; and there is the passion for new Australian plays. The writers she works with, Dee says, “have something to say about the world. They’re passionate, they’re political, they want to shake things up.” #NoExemptions is from Melbourne playwright Angela Buckingham. Set in a dystopian near-future where the climate emergency has led to a militarised state, it imagines the anger a young generation holds against their parents who didn’t act when they could. “We think we’re all doing our little bit for the world and society,” Dee says. “We sign our petitions. We might go to a rally. But I think it’s about trying to activate an audience a little bit more to take something on.” The idea that theatre can achieve this is “why I’m an artist and why I still keep working” she says. “I still feel theatre can shift consciousness.” Melbourne Workers Theatre closed in 2012. “They were brave,” Dee says. Her most ambitious work for the company, 1999’s Tower of Light, was a response to the opening of Melbourne’s casino. It had a cast of more than 100, and was staged in the cattle pavilion at Melbourne Showgrounds. It seems hard to imagine an independent company staging that work today. Federal arts funding was falling even before the pandemic, and with small – or even no – audiences, independent theatre companies have found themselves struggling to survive. “These companies now have been decimated,” Dee says. “Where are the smaller companies now?” “There are gorgeous little companies. Always, voices will emerge and companies will emerge. But I feel that we’re in a bit of a dire strait.” #NoExemptions, she says, is run off the “smell of an oily rag”. While there is a sense of pessimism around the state of arts funding – and, more broadly, “this horrific time that we’re in”, she says – there is a bold optimism when it comes to Dee’s own future. With “10 or 12” shows in various stages of development, Dee says she feels “really blessed”. “They’re not happy works,” she says. “I think most of them are along the darker side of life. But they’re important works. Important works that say something about the world we’re in right now.” And regardless of where they are staged – at big festivals or in tiny spaces – she has no intention of stopping working at La Mama. “Until I fucking die, hopefully,” she says, “I’ll still be doing shows at La Mama.” #NoExemptions is on at La Mama Courthouse theatre in Melbourne until 8 May",Arts/Stage,Susie Dee on a lifetime spent staging the revolution: ‘Theatre can shift consciousness’,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/28/susie-dee-on-a-lifetime-spent-staging-the-revolution-theatre-can-shift-consciousness
4/28/2022,"If ever a fruit seemed purpose-designed to lift spirits as we head into the darker, cooler months, it’s the persimmon. The jaunty pumpkin-coloured treat brings a pop of vivid orange to greengrocers’ shelves, and when ripe, adds a healthy helping of honeyed, date-like sweetness wherever it’s used. This subtly flavoured fruit is attracting more attention in Australia but as a nation, we’ve been comparatively slow to warm to persimmons. Persimmons have been spreading cheer in China for millennia and the delicacy is so prized in Japan it’s the country’s national fruit. In Korea it’s called the Korean mango. These tangerine-hued fruit began appearing in specialty grocers and some supermarkets recently. Traditionally the season runs from February until mid-June but La Niña forced a later start. “The season was looking real good in Queensland – but a lot of persimmons are grown near the coast and the metre of rain that arrived right before picking was a disaster,” says grower Chris Stillard, chairperson of Persimmon Australia, the industry’s peak body. “Twenty years ago you’d never see a persimmon in a supermarket,” Stillard says. “Ninety-five percent of the fruit then went straight to Cabramatta, an Asian hub. Now we’re seeing small amounts on shelves of supermarkets as well as greengrocers.” Suncoast Fresh supplies fruit and veg to restaurants and cafes in Queensland and northern New South Wales. Glenn Connor manages the Brisbane depot and says so far, persimmon sales are up 28% on last year. “We’re definitely selling more … a lot of higher-end chefs are looking for something different.” The main fact to know about persimmons, Stillard says, is there are two distinct types on the Australian market. The first is the original or astringent persimmon which arrived in the 1850s. It’s thought these were brought by Chinese migrants during the gold rush. Cultivation of non-astringent or sweet persimmons, the second style, didn’t start until the 70s. Botanically, astringent and non-astringent persimmon (genus Diospyros) belong to the ebenaceae family, a group which also includes ebony hardwood. The Stillard family’s 283 hectare property is in Barooga in the Riverina, NSW. They’ve cultivated persimmon orchards for more than 30 years. Barring fresh disasters, Stillard says the NSW season looks very good for 2022, with NSW and Victoria jointly accounting for around 40% of persimmon production and Queensland contributing around 30%. Stillard produces two varieties of sweet persimmon, the Jiro and the Fuyu. “The Jiro is a slightly flatter fruit and the Fuyu is rounder, but unless you really know your stuff you wouldn’t pick the difference,” says Stillard. The Fuyu is the most popular variety sold in Australia. More than 95% of fruit sold domestically are this sweet, stubbier, non-astringent style of persimmon. “The Asian and eastern European markets prefer astringent persimmons. But the Australian market is all about the sweet or non-astringent persimmon.” Sweet persimmons look a bit like smooth-skinned miniature Halloween pumpkins. They’re usually the size of a beefsteak tomato and can either be eaten firm or left to ripen until soft. Teardrop or heart-shaped original astringent persimmon must always be left to fully ripen. They’re ready to eat only when their flesh softens and turns to jelly and the skin becomes translucent – any earlier and the tannic astringency is mouth-puckeringly nasty, like eating unripe banana. Ripening can be sped up by placing fruit in a paper bag with a banana for a few days. The ethylene released by the banana persuades the persimmon to soften. It is thought bad memories of trying unripe astringent persimmon may have turned some older Australians off the fruit. Alanna Sapwell, head chef at Beach, Byron Bay, sources persimmons from Picone Exotics in Mullumbimby. John Picone cultivates an orchard of over 400 spray-free tropical and subtropical fruits. “He grows both astringent and non-astringent persimmon but I prefer non-astringent,” says Sapwell. “I love the flexibility of the fruit because it works in both sweet and savoury applications.” One of the dishes which brought Sapwell national critical acclaim at Queensland’s now shuttered Arc Dining, featured house-made goose prosciutto draped over ribbons of sweet persimmon, with fresh curd and fig leaf oil. She’s also fermented the fruit like black garlic. “A lot of people still haven’t tried persimmon before. Usually I describe it as looking a bit like a yellow tomato and tasting more like a pear but with a flavour that can go right the way through to rockmelon,” says Sapwell. “It’s hard to describe but it’s a very approachable fruit. I’d encourage anyone to try it. When they do, they usually end up wondering why they haven’t had it before.” Sapwell says persimmons marry well with seafood and cured meats like prosciutto. They also work with vanilla, spices and cream. “I like to use persimmon in dishes where they can be the star because it opens people’s minds up to the fruit, when it’s the showstopper ingredient.” Graded according to size, persimmons are named for the number which fit a 4kg tray. Stillard’s preference is for a tennis ball-sized 28 but the size 12 – a massive fruit, some weighing up to nearly half a kilo – is popular overseas and consequently rarely seen in Australia. “It’s a status fruit and the majority are exported to Malaysia and Singapore. They’re very sought-after.” Like any fruit, persimmons should be used at their peak. Sapwell reckons the best way to tell is to simply taste it. Stillard likes eating his sweet persimmon crunchy, like an apple. He suggests choosing firm fruit and says generally, the deeper the colour, the better tasting the fruit. Store fruit stem-end down and keep them at room temperature. Never put persimmon in the fridge. They don’t like temperature extremes and they’ll go mushy, Stillard says. Better yet, why not put them to work in some of the ideas below, or just whip up Sapwell’s tasty tarte tatin? The honeyed sweetness of persimmon pairs well with salty preserved meats such as prosciutto or serrano ham. Add slices of ripe yet firm fruit to a charcuterie platter. Persimmon also works beautifully with cheese – choose anything from creamy mozzarella or burrata to a briny feta, blue cheese or even tart goat’s curd. Balance the chilli heat of a Thai-style salad and add a splash of colour by including the sweet crunch of firm yet ripe sweet persimmon. Add the persimmon batons or chunks to a spicily dressed tumble of cooked prawn, with coriander, mint and Thai basil. Or make a beef or chicken salad with plenty of Thai herbs and finish with roasted peanuts and slices of persimmon. Try a mood-lifting cold weather salad using lots of peppery rocket, watercress, goat’s cheese and persimmon chunks finished with a scatter of toasted pumpkin and sunflower seeds, dressed with a simple Dijon mustard vinaigrette. Add chunks of ripe persimmon to a smoothie when you feel like a sweeter treat but don’t want to use honey. Add cinnamon to taste, and it will boost sweetness further. Or simply include persimmon slices with your breakfast granola and yoghurt. “If you haven’t used persimmons before they are a fun alternative to apples or pears when in season, especially in desserts. They work well with nuts, spices and a good dollop of something creamy. You can use this recipe to either make three individual tartes, or a larger size which should serve three. Choose your own adventure with this one, with either a vanilla ice-cream or creme fraiche to finish.” Prep 10-15 minsCook 25-30 minsServes 3 1 large non-astringent persimmon3 sheets quality puff pastry100g brown sugar50g butter3 sprigs lemon thyme Preheat oven to 180C.

Alternatively use a 25cm pie dish, place sugar and butter in the base and cut the persimmons into wedges so they fan out.

Cut a round from a sheet of semi-frozen puff pastry that’s slightly bigger than the persimmon and place it on top of the sugar, butter and fruit, tucking the sides in slightly.

4/28/2022,"The latest inflation figures showing a 5.1% increase in prices over the past 12 months mean three things: the budget figures are already wrong, an interest rate rise next week is very likely, and last, workers have seen their real wages absolutely smashed. It is not unusual for budget figures to be wrong, but to be wrong after just one month takes some doing. Four weeks ago, the budget predicted that inflation growth in the 12 months to June this year would be 4.25%, and yet the figures released on Wednesday by the Bureau of Statistics found that in the 12 months to March inflation had already grown by 5.1%: Graph not displaying? Click here That was the fastest since the GST, and outside that abnormal period, the fastest since 1995. For the 4.25% budget prediction to come true, prices in the June quarter (which we are in) would have to stay absolutely flat. That – baring a massive collapse in oil prices or the housing market – is almost certainly not going to happen. And so, we have a budget wrong, just four weeks after it was issued. Hardly the type of thing that brings the phrase “strong economic management” to mind. More importantly, however, a 5.1% increase – which was above expectations – means that the Reserve Bank is now more likely than not to increase the cash rate next week: Graph not displaying? Click here I have always considered it unlikely that the RBA would increase rates in May because I assumed it would wait to see the latest wage price index figures that come out three days before the election on 18 May. But I suspect these inflation figures mean the RBA cannot wait. The reason is what is driving the high inflation. The first is obviously petrol prices. The big spike in prices in March off the back of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine saw an 11% jump in automotive fuel prices in the three months to December alone: Graph not displaying? Click here That means fuel prices are now 22% above what they were before the pandemic and 61% above what they were in the middle of 2020 when we were all in lockdown (and thus not driving). Now the Reserve Bank can’t do anything about petrol prices, because like other items known as “tradables”, petrol prices are largely set on the world market. Graph not displaying? Click here But what is noticeable in the latest figures is that non-tradable items (such as rents, house prices, childcare, hairdressing, education, gas and electricity) rose 1.8% in the March quarter and 4.2% in the past year. Over the past 20 years, the Reserve Bank has only increased the cash rate in periods when non-tradable prices have risen by more than 3% (except for once after the GFC). A growth of 4.2% is firmly above that level: Graph not displaying? Click here And that, more than anything, means a rate rise next week is likelier than it was before these figures come out. A rate rise is of course going to hurt homeowners and will probably flow through to those renting. It also means pain for workers, who are now watching inflation grow more than twice as fast as wages: Graph not displaying? Click here It also means that real wages in the 12 months to March this year will have almost certainly fallen by more than 2%. In the 12 months to December, wages rose 2.3%. Even if we bump that up to 2.5% for the March quarter, the fall in real wages would be so great they would be back to 2014 levels: Graph not displaying? Click here That truly destroys any sense that there has been some glorious recovery out of the pandemic. Yes, GDP has increased, and yes unemployment has fallen, but much of that can be put down to the massive stimulus for the government and the cash rate being lowered to 0.1% and the abnormality of zero migration. But what has actually happened to people’s standard of living? A plunge. That story is actually even worse than these figures suggest, because the items that have had the biggest prices rises are the things you can’t avoid paying – fuel, gas, education, meat, fruit and vegetables, coffee, preschool. In the past year the price of non-discretionary items has risen much faster than average inflation: Graph not displaying? Click here Because low-income households spend more of their income on these non-discretionary items it means the fall in their real wages has been much greater – well over 3%. And so with these latest inflation figures, the government is going to an election where workers’ ability to buy things with their wages is on average little different from what it was when Tony Abbott took office in September 2013. That is not a sign of success.",News/Business,The Australian inflation rate gives the lie to Morrison’s claims of strong economic management | Greg Jericho,https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2022/apr/27/australian-inflation-rate-figures-give-the-lie-to-scott-morrison-claims-of-strong-economic-management
4/28/2022,"In the 2019 election, inequality was a major campaign theme. In the run up to polling day, the then Labor leader Bill Shorten declared inequality killed hope and created a fault line in politics by fostering a “sense of powerlessness that drives people away from the political mainstream, and down the low road of blaming minorities, and promising to turn back the clock”. Back then, Labor promised to pursue measures like the abolition of franking credits – characterised by Shorten as “unsustainable largesse for high-income earners” – and curbs to negative gearing. These policies raised the revenue underpinning Labor’s then antidote – projected increases in social spending in areas like health and education. But after voters rejected that agenda in 2019, Anthony Albanese overhauled both the policy and the rhetoric. Labor continues to argue government is a positive force in the lives of Australians, but now, Albanese speaks of a future where “no one is held back and no one is left behind”. The substantive focus may have shifted since 2019, and the rhetoric may have softened, but the problem of inequality persists. A report released in March from the Australian Council of Social Service and the University of New South Wales points out that government payments distributed during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic halved poverty and significantly reduced income inequality in this country. But that trend was reversed when the support ended. The Morrison government did agree to a permanent $50 increase in the fortnightly jobseeker payment once the coronavirus supplement ended – but that was well below what social services groups had championed. Labor also confirmed in April it had dropped plans for a review of the rate. Data from Guardian Australia’s election Seat Explorer maps the extreme inequality across Australia. It shows the most advantaged electorates have median incomes almost double the most disadvantaged. In some electorates, 20% of households spend more than 30% of their incomes on rent. The Seat Explorer allows you to dive deep on demographic, health, wealth and inequality data. Unfortunately, the best data available on many of these dimensions is from the 2016 census. The data from the 2021 census has not yet been released and so Guardian Australia partnered with academics from Griffith University to adjust the 2016 census data for the latest electoral boundaries. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Analysing the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage (IRSAD) shows that the Labor-held electorate of Spence, in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, and Mallee, an electorate held by the Nationals in western Victoria, are the electorates with the highest percentage of disadvantaged households. Electorates that have a higher proportion of advantaged areas are traditional Liberal party strongholds, like Berowra and Bradfield in greater Sydney. The Melbourne electorates of Kooyong and Goldstein – blue ribbon territories under challenge from “teal” independents in 2022 – also make the cut. IRSAD takes into account factors such as income, education, unemployment, rent and mortgage, and family size. A high score indicates a relative lack of disadvantage and greater advantage. We can further explore the factors that make up the inequality index by diving deeper into two electorates – Goldstein in suburban Melbourne and Lingiari in the Northern Territory. Eighty-nine per cent of Goldstein is in the most advantaged three deciles (top 30%) of the IRSAD index, while just 21% of Lingiari residents are in the most advantaged areas, with 43% of Lingiari residents living in the most disadvantaged areas.

The seat is Labor-held, but the retirement of the ALP veteran Warren Snowdon has put the marginal electorate in play. Lingiari has one of the highest proportions of renters, households needing more bedrooms (a measure of housing suitability) and homelessness of any electorate. The median personal weekly income range is $650-$799 compared to $871 for the Northern Territory and $662 nationally. The relatively more advantaged seat of Goldstein has some of the lowest percentage of households that are renters, in mortgage and rental stress (where more than 30% of incomes are spent on repayments and rent) and need more bedrooms of any electorate. The median personal weekly income in Goldstein is $800-$999, which is significantly higher than Lingiari and Victoria ($644). The highest earning electorates in the country are Wentworth and North Sydney, both in greater Sydney, with a median income range of $1,250-$1,499. Spence, which has the highest share of disadvantaged areas, is one of the 26 electorates with a median income range of $500-$649 – the lowest. Seven per cent of Lingiari’s population has a bachelor’s degree as their highest level of education. In Goldstein, it is 19% and the national average was 22%. The Queensland electorate of Groom is right in the middle, at 9%. Electorates in Sydney and Melbourne rank the highest on this score, at 24%.",News/Australia news,In 2019 inequality was a big federal election issue.

4/28/2022,"Certain points in the history of the A-League Men can be seen as seminal moments that have forever altered the competition’s young landscape. Brisbane Roar turning to a manager whose most recent gig had resulted in relegation from the Victorian Premier League is one example. The bitter congress wars of the late 2010s and resulting independence of the leagues from Football Australia is another. The decision by Sydney FC in 2014 to appoint Graham Arnold as their manager is yet another. For all the notoriety gained from Alessandro Del Piero’s two-year stint at Moore Park, the double-winning campaign of 2009-10 was a fading memory – Sydney had not recorded a single finals win in the four seasons since. Exacerbating matters, Western Sydney Wanderers were increasingly ascendant; the crosstown rivals had made back-to-back grand final appearances and were widely credited with supercharging the competition. Yet Arnold’s bombastic arrival augured a shift in the balance of power. The city of Sydney subtly shifted from red and black, back to sky blue. Sydney FC established a dynasty in the years that followed, winning three championships, three premierships, and an FFA Cup. They became a team of killbots, mercilessly grinding down teams and taking points from games they had no right to. Arnold’s departure to take over the Socceroos prior to the 2018–19 season resulted in nary a speed bump as Steve Corica, well-versed in the ways of Arnieball, continued in his mentor’s stead. But all good things must come to an end. All empires eventually fall. On Monday evening, Corica watched on as Yokohama F. Marinos put three past his side, dealing a hefty blow to their hopes of progression to the Asian Champions League’s knockout stages. When they return to Australia for the last two games of their ALM campaign, Sydney will be staring down the barrel of missing the finals for the first time in over half a decade; sixth-placed Central Coast Mariners are two points clear with a game in hand. At the same time that the limitations of Arnold’s approach are being exposed at international level, Corica has also hit a wall. His commitment to maintaining the principles that underlined so much of Sydney’s dynasty has begun to wear thin. Purpose and commitment have slowly metamorphosed into inflexibility and conservatism. Though it was successful enough at its peak to completely alter the entire league’s approach to possession and how to attack, a lack of evolution is increasingly being zeroed in on by the opposition. As a result, it is reaching a point of diminishing returns. An extensive injury list and the short turnarounds do go some way towards explaining their struggles, yet at the same time, the club is hardly the only ALM team to have faced challenges on this front. An inability to foster sufficient depth at a club that isn’t exactly cash shy, and the utilisation of available talent, can’t be hand-waved away by the pandemic. The 49-year-old has put his own spin on things and recruited more widely than given credit for, but the shadow of Arnold still looms large over this team. As do the obvious foibles of Arnieball: dead possession, players not being utilised as effectively as they could be, and a lack of a back-up plan against better sides. Even if the fates smile upon them and Sydney FC do sneak into finals, the likelihood of this team being able to do damage once there is questionable, and would not obscure the obvious need for rejuvenation. Yet as a club legend, Corica will likely return. Arnold also missed finals once in his Sydney tenure and, short of José Mourinho or Marcelo Bielsa developing a sudden desire to live in Bondi, he has produced sufficient silverware and carries enough institutional respect to prove 2021-22 an aberration. But how many members of the squad will remain? A significant cohort of the club’s squad is off-contract and several key contributors are on the wrong side of 30. Some, such as Miloš Ninković are closer to 40 than 30. Significant change is already guaranteed off the field. The club will return to Moore Park as tenants of the newly constructed Sydney Football Stadium for the 2022-23 campaign and will welcome in a new CEO after Danny Townsend – who played a key role in developing a club that at one point was the reigning men’s, women’s, youth, and even E-League champions – finally completes his transition to the Australian Professional Leagues. Whether or not this is a good thing – a spirit of regeneration and innovation permeating the club – or a bad thing – instability and paralysis seeping in – remains to be seen. With this sudden vicissitude in mind, perhaps it was fitting that former Melbourne Victory coach Kevin Muscat was on the sidelines as the boss of Yokohama on Monday. His last game in ALM was a 6-1 humiliation at the hands of Corica in the 2017-18 semi-final, a result that ushered in another turning point for the league as the Victorian powerhouses fell into two years of misery. Victory represent a true anti role model for Sydney: years of hubris and the resultant institutional lethargy led to a fall that resulted in the keys to the castle being handed to Tony Popovic. Further, the Sky Blues only need to look across town at the Wanderers to know that moving into a shiny new stadium is not a panacea. Sydney is a club at an existential crossroads. Forewarned of the dangers, it is highly unlikely they will fall into a similar mire as Victory or embrace the insidious, creeping apathy that is Wanderers’ ALM side. But such incidents serve as reminders that they can happen to anyone.",Sport/Football,Sydney FC: struggling A-League Men club arrives at crossroads | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/28/sydney-fc-struggling-a-league-men-club-arrives-at-crossroads
4/28/2022,"The Coalition last year required polluting businesses to buy 419,000 carbon credits at an estimated cost of $15m using a policy that Scott Morrison now falsely describes as “Labor’s sneaky carbon tax”. Government data released last month shows that, under the Coalition’s so-called safeguard mechanism, major polluting companies had to buy 70% more carbon credits last financial year than in 2019-20. Industry representatives said it showed Australia already had an emissions compliance system that forced major polluters to pay for some emissions despite Morrison claiming its use of the safeguard mechanism involved “incentives”. Several business groups implicitly called on the government to drop its attack on Labor over climate policy and to join the opposition in promising to use the safeguard mechanism to cut emissions. The safeguard was designed by then environment minister Greg Hunt and introduced under Tony Abbott to limit increases in industrial emissions that would otherwise wipe out pollution cuts paid for by the government using its $4.5bn emissions reduction fund. It requires the owners of major industrial sites to buy carbon offsets if they emit above a limit, known as a baseline. Labor has promised if elected to “predictably and gradually” reduce emissions baselines to help meet climate targets, following a recommendation of the Business Council of Australia. The Coalition had a similar commitment to use the safeguard to cut emissions when Hunt was minister but dropped it when he left the portfolio. With opinion polls suggesting the contest is bogged down at the mid-point, Morrison has moved in recent days to reignite the climate wars. It comes as Coalition figures are publicly at loggerheads about whether or not the Morrison government had made a firm commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050, with the Nationals senator Matt Canavan declaring the policy “all over bar the shouting”. Morrison suggested on Wednesday the safeguard mechanism would be a “sneaky carbon tax” on “our traditional industries” under Labor. Asked if that meant the Coalition had introduced a sneaky carbon tax, given it created the safeguard mechanism, he said the difference was “how the thresholds work and the fact we put incentives in place”. “What Labor is doing is binding them on this and issuing penalties on those companies, so they couldn’t be more different,” he said. Labor frontbencher Jason Clare said Morrison’s claims were “absolute rubbish” and “the important thing here is to have a look at the motivations of the Liberal party”. “They are all over the shop at the moment,” he said. “We’re in the middle of an election campaign and you’ve got the government at war with itself over climate change. I reckon most people who are watching at the moment have had a gut full of this.” Morrison’s “incentives” could be a reference to a proposed “safeguard crediting mechanism” that would allow companies that cut emissions below their baseline to earn credits they could sell. Labor has proposed a similar change. It was among the recommendations of an expert panel review in 2020, and the government has consulted with industry and allocated $279.9m over 10 years to buy credits, but it has yet not been introduced. Industry groups have called on politicians to use the safeguard to cut emissions, not as a political weapon. “Most businesses will again be deeply disappointed that effective carbon policy and a sensible debate has been overtaken by partisan politics,” said John Connor, the chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute, an industry association with a membership including most major emitters. The Business Council of Australia, representing top corporates, said: “The safeguard mechanism is already in place alongside a suite of other measures to reduce emissions, with careful consultation with industry we believe it is the right incentive to drive investment, deliver more jobs and meet our net-zero commitments.” It was backed by another major business association, the Australian Industry Group. A spokesperson pointed Guardian Australia to previous public advocacy, including a call for the safeguard mechanism to be “built on as a driver of long-term abatement within industry and the wider economy”. The new data released in March showed the Clean Energy Regulator, the government agency that runs the safeguard, last year required the owners of 14 industrial sites to buy 419,315 credits to offset emissions above their baselines, significantly more than in the three previous years. Connor said the average price of a credit on the small Australian market during the compliance period was about $36 a tonne, suggesting the businesses could have together paid more than $15m for credits. The increase in what companies have been forced to pay for their emissions follows significant criticism of the scheme’s operation. As Guardian Australia has reported, companies have consistently been allowed to increase their carbon pollution without penalty. Industrial emissions are up 17% since 2005 and about 7% since the safeguard began operating in 2016. Both industry representatives and climate activists have argued it has made the scheme, as currently operated, a waste of time. Modelling for Labor has suggested its policy would start to change that by reducing emissions by about 213m tonnes by 2030. It says it would ask the regulator to work with companies to make the cuts in a way that supported “international competitiveness and economic growth” and did not disadvantage exporters in global markets. Connor said with a full cap and trade carbon pricing mechanism off the table, the safeguard mechanism was “the best place to start a policy that provides clearer investment guidance and guardrails for the task of industrial decarbonisation”. He said that was why it had been supported by the business council and Ai Group. He said the last Australian climate policy survey in 2021 found 79% of business respondents believed mandatory baselines under the safeguard mechanism should be set to reduce over time, in line with Australia’s 2030 emissions reduction target.",News/Environment,Coalition climate policy forced big polluters to pay $15m for carbon credits in past year,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/28/coalition-climate-policy-forced-big-polluters-to-pay-15m-for-carbon-credits-in-past-year
4/28/2022,"The former attorney general Christian Porter rejected a plea for mercy from six Indonesians who said they were wrongly jailed as children using unreliable evidence, telling them they had no chance of success despite their lawyers pointing to a landmark ruling years earlier finding a miscarriage of justice in a similar case. The six Indonesians, then aged between 13 and 17, were detained on a series of people smuggling boats in 2009 and were prosecuted by the commonwealth and jailed as adults in maximum security prisons in Western Australia. The boys, all from remote fishing villages, were often duped into crewing the boats and repeatedly told Australian authorities they were juveniles after they were intercepted. Federal police policy dictated that, as children, they should have been sent home. Instead the police relied on a flawed technique using wrist X-rays to prove their adulthood. Evidence based on that technique has since been found to be “entirely discredited” by the WA court of appeal in a separate case in 2017, a criticism that commonwealth prosecutors now accept. Five of the six boys pleaded guilty after being charged as adults, meaning the evidence about their ages wasn’t tested in court. The boys were convicted and jailed in maximum security facilities, before being released and returned home to Indonesia in 2011. In 2020, seeking to have their convictions overturned, the six men asked Porter to exercise his discretion under the royal prerogative of mercy and refer their cases to the WA court of appeal. Their lawyers, Ken Cush and Associates, told Porter the convictions were a “substantial miscarriage of justice”. The letter described in detail every instance in which the six Indonesians insisted they were children to Australian authorities and informed Porter that wrist X-rays were now widely discredited as a means of age determination. If he had granted the request, Porter would have made the children’s quest for justice much simpler, avoiding the need for them to convince a court to hear their cases more than 10 years out of time. Porter refused all six applications. He said the request made by their lawyers was not a proper request for mercy, but even if it had been, he would have refused it. “This is on the basis that a court of appeal could not reasonably conclude that a miscarriage of justice has occurred and that the circumstances of this case do not warrant the exercise of my discretion to refer the matter,” Porter wrote in early July 2020. Porter’s assertion that a court could not “reasonably conclude” there had been a miscarriage of justice came despite the Indonesians’ lawyers pointing to a ruling of the WA court of appeal three years earlier, in the highly similar case of Ali Jasmin, which found that the wrist X-ray technique was “unreliable” and that a “miscarriage of justice” had occurred. Porter’s letter, seen by the Guardian, did not mention that he had a previous link to the case from his time as WA attorney general and corrections minister. Porter was not involved in the prosecutions, but as the minister in 2010 he received a complaint alleging that Indonesian children were being held in his state’s jails on people-smuggling charges. That claim was made by the Indonesia Institute, a peak body for Australian-Indonesian relations and engagement. The institute did not identify any particular prisoners, but complained that “a number of inmates are below 18 years of age”. “Several of our members have contacted us concerning a number of young Indonesian men being held at Hakea, Albany and Casuarina Prisons,” the institute’s president, Ross Taylor, wrote. “These men are, we are told, incarcerated as a result of convictions and charges concerning illegal fishing and ‘people smuggling’.” Porter’s response, also seen by the Guardian, dismissed the concerns and placed heavy reliance on the wrist X-rays conducted by federal police. “None of the prisoners currently in Departmental prisons have been verified as being under the age of 18,” he wrote, in a letter dated 6 December 2010. “Information concerning the identities and ages of Indonesian prisoners are provided to the Department by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) during the transfer of prisoners into the custody of the Department. “Bone density age verification tests are undertaken by the AFP prior to the transfer of the prisoner into Departmental custody where the age of the prisoner is in question. Following transfer into Departmental custody, where claims or allegations are made of a prisoner being under 18 years of age, the Department seeks confirmation from the AFP that a bone density test was conducted.” According to a federal court decision in February, the commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions privately advised Porter in 2019 that it had no objection to him allowing the six men the referral they sought to appeal against their convictions as miscarriages of justice. The Guardian asked Porter whether, given his prior link to the issue and his former department’s own reliance on the wrist X-ray technique, he should have removed himself from any involvement in the children’s bid to have their appeals heard last year. Porter was also asked why he concluded there was no prospect of the men succeeding despite the apparent advice of the CDPP that it did not oppose the referrals. He did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The retired New South Wales supreme court judge Anthony Whealy said Porter’s earlier involvement in the matter “complicated” his decision to refuse the Indonesians a referral to the WA court of appeal. “Christian Porter’s decision in 2019 to refuse referral to the WA court of appeal is complicated by his earlier involvement as WA state attorney general and corrections minister in 2010,” he told the Guardian. Whealy also criticised the “intransigence” of Porter in 2019, “especially in light of the DPP’s benevolent attitude”. His approach to such cases diverged from the then acting attorney general, Greg Hunt, and the former attorney general George Brandis. Hunt dealt with a similar request for mercy in the case of Rayan Abdul, a juvenile also prosecuted as an adult using the wrist X-ray evidence. In February 2019, more than a year before Porter rejected the mercy applications, Hunt agreed to refer Abdul’s case to the WA court of appeal. “The expert witness evidence regarding wrist X-rays led by the Commonwealth of the Director of Public Prosecution during Mr Abdul’s age determination hearing in the Magistrates Court of Western Australia was later found by the courts to be not capable of being applied to determine whether a person is 18 years of age,” Hunt wrote. “I have concluded that the above fact raises an issue which would appropriately be considered by a court on referral.” In 2015, Brandis received a similar request from lawyers for Ali Jasmin, jailed as an adult people smuggler when he was a 12-year-old boy on the basis of the wrist X-ray technique. After Jasmin’s lawyers used the courts to force Brandis to make a decision, the attorney general accepted the request and referred the case to the WA court of appeal. The court ultimately overturned Jasmin’s conviction, describing the wrist X-ray technique as “unreliable”. The crown also conceded the technique was inaccurate. This created a “fairly clear precedent” for the other six Indonesians to ask for the same referral, the federal court has said. Despite Porter’s refusal, the six men were eventually able to have their cases heard before the WA court of appeal, using another avenue. They successfully persuaded the court to hear their appeals, despite them being more than 10 years late, and it overturned their convictions without any opposition from commonwealth prosecutors. In a judgment published on Tuesday, the WA court of appeal said a “substantial miscarriage of justice” had occurred. “The Crown has conceded that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by each of the convictions; the judgments of conviction should be set aside; and judgments of acquittal should be entered,” the court said. “The Crown accepts that there was no reliable evidence when each appellant was convicted and sentenced that he was of or over the age of 18 years.”",News/Australia news,Christian Porter denied justice plea from Indonesians jailed in Australia when they were children,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/28/christian-porter-denied-justice-plea-from-indonesians-jailed-in-australia-when-they-were-children
4/28/2022,"Only 1.6% of private rental properties in Australia are affordable for minimum wage earners and all but zero for those on benefits, Anglicare’s annual snapshot has found. The Rental Affordability report, released on Thursday, took data from the rental listings on realestate.com.au over a single weekend and assessed whether those properties were affordable – costing no more than 30% of a household budget – for people on low incomes. The report recommended reforming commonwealth rent assistance (CRA) by raising the rate by 50% – a call that is supported by the Australian Council of Social Service, National Shelter and the Grattan Institute among others – as well as indexing it to average rents by geographic location so it kicks in before rental payments cause serious financial stress. A Guardian Australia analysis found that soaring rents have dramatically outstripped increases to the CRA payment over the past two years, with house rentals in capital cities rising by an average of 13.8% while rent assistance has risen by a maximum of 4.52%, leaving low-income renters hardest hit by the national rental crisis. The sample in this year’s snapshot illustrated a substantial squeeze in the market: taken on 19 March, it yielded 45,992 available rentals nationally, down 38% from March 2021, when there were 74,266 listings. A single person on minimum wage could only afford 720, or 1.6%, of available listings, while a couple on the age pension could only afford 663, or 1.4%, of what was on the market. For a couple on jobseeker payments with two children, there were only 78 affordable properties nationally, with only two of those in metropolitan areas of Victoria, and none in Sydney. There were no affordable options for people on youth allowance, and only seven properties – all sharehouses – that were affordable for single people on jobseeker. Only 51 properties – 0.1% – were affordable for people on the disability support pension, and that was without considering whether it would fit any specific needs of an applicant. “After thirteen years of producing the Rental Affordability Snapshot, it is clear that housing in Australia is broken,” the report said. “The lack of affordable rentals is hurting households on low incomes across the board. … This year’s results also show how brutal the rental market is for young people on Centrelink payments.” For Jessica Preston, 19, who lives in Canberra and has been studying early childhood education, the experience of trying to find a place to live has been deeply stressful. Preston receives youth allowance and works casually in a minimum wage role at an early learning centre. She has been sharing a house with two friends since 30 July last year – a house that took them five months to find. Even in a sharehouse situation, Preston said her income did not stretch far enough. “I got my paycheque today and I think I spent the majority of it – it barely covers my rent. At the moment I have a bunch of bills coming in, and it’s all about trying to scramble to pull things together and figuring out how we’re going to make things work this week.” At one point in her housing search, Preston got stuck and put in an application for emergency housing. “When they didn’t call me back after one, two weeks, I forgot about it. I got a call six months later saying ‘we’ve got a place for you’. I was like, I really appreciate it but I’ve already got a place. I had to go out there and do things myself,” she said. “From what I understand they did their very best, but they can only offer what they have to offer. They can’t magically make things appear.” Preston said she found it difficult to listen to politicians talk about housing because it made her too upset. “I get too annoyed listening to them. I’ve never cared about politics before but in the last six months or so, I’ve realised what’s really going on. From my experience, what our current government is doing is not enough. I’ve heard Labor in particular talk about making improvements, but I haven’t heard much else,” she said. “I really think people deserve the dignity of having more than just enough.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The state of Australia’s rental market was “absolutely appalling”, said Anglicare Australia’s executive director, Kasy Chambers. “I think many politicians still feel that renting is a transitory living experience. For many people, it’s not. There are more and more Australians renting for longer and longer. It’s an invisible part of housing. “We really need to be looking at raising payment rates,” said Chambers. She pointed to the experience of the Covid-19 pandemic income support increases. “The cost of those programs didn’t destroy the economy, the sky didn’t fall in.” The report also recommended building more social housing, addressing tenancy security – “it’s a very one-way contract at the moment”, Chambers said – and fixing the tax system. “The tax system sees and encourages development and property purchasing as a private wealth generator. So we get individuals buying properties to rent them out. We really have to change that,” Chambers said. “There’s a vast amount of money that goes into housing from the commonwealth. The private rental market is underpinned by negative gearing, by capital gains tax concessions and by the CRA. The commonwealth has a lot to say in this area already. It’s spending a lot of money and it needs to be spending it wisely. “But morally speaking, it’s hard as a citizen to participate, to educate your kids, to go to work, if your housing isn’t in place. It’s the most important brick in social welfare. Unless people are actually starving, the next thing they need is housing. When that’s not there, all those other pieces can very easily fall apart.” Preston said the idea of home ownership was completely off her horizon. She said she was trying to save $50 a fortnight, but “until very recently saving wasn’t even a viable option”. “I honestly do not feel in our current economy that I will ever be able to afford my own place,” she said. “It’s sad. I always dreamed of growing up and having my own family but I don’t feel like that’s possible now.” Have you had a bad experience with the rental market?

4/28/2022,"Labor has raised grave concerns about the home affairs minister’s use of “privileged access to intelligence reporting”, after Karen Andrews publicly alluded to a potential attempt by China at interference in the federal election. The shadow minister, Kristina Keneally, has written to Andrews to remind her of “the vital convention that opposition is briefed on any developing matters of national security” during the election caretaker mode. The letter, seen by Guardian Australia, was sent after Andrews implied China might have timed the announcement of a security deal with Solomon Islands to influence the Australian election outcome. “Noting your privileged access to intelligence reporting in your position as home affairs minister, I am gravely concerned by these assertions,” Keneally said in the letter. “If security agencies have identified an attempt to sway Australia’s elections, Labor should be briefed as a priority,” she said. “If your comments were speculative and unsupported by intelligence reporting, I urge you to clarify your comments publicly as soon as possible. “All members of parliament should be mindful of the Asio director-general’s advice that stoking fear of foreign interference can be as corrosive to Australia’s democracy as an act of foreign interference itself.” Andrews made the comments amid intense focus on whether Australia “dropped the ball in the Pacific” – an issue that has complicated the Coalition’s push to project a strong message on national security before the 21 May election. Labor has claimed the deal – announced first by a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson in Beijing last week – represents the biggest Australian foreign policy failure in the Pacific since the second world war. But the prime minister, Scott Morrison, rejected that argument, saying China was exerting “enormous pressure” on Pacific island countries and did not “play by the same rules as transparent liberal democracies”. During an interview on 4BC radio on Wednesday, Andrews said that something “we should be at least taking notice of, and paying attention to, is the timing of the announcements and the deals in relation to the Solomon Islands”. “Beijing is very clearly aware that we’re in a federal election campaign here at the moment and now we have a significant focus on what is happening in the Pacific islands, what China is doing,” Andrews said. “Now, why now? Why in the middle of a federal election campaign is all this coming to light? I mean, we talk about political interference and that has many forms so I think we need to be very much aware of what Beijing is doing, what its plans are, what it’s trying to achieve.” Andrews’ comments, while carefully worded and in some cases posed as questions, clearly carried the implication that China may have announced the deal during the election campaign to hurt the Coalition, which has taken a tough line on Beijing. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Some within government are sceptical of that claim, given there are bigger regional factors potentially at play. Other Australian based analysts, speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter, said playing into the election might be seen as a bonus for Beijing, but the Chinese government wanted the security agreement and would have pressed on regardless. A draft of the security agreement was leaked in March and it had been widely reported that Joe Biden’s top Indo-Pacific adviser, Kurt Campbell, was headed to Solomon Islands to directly raise US concerns about the prospective deal. The announcement was made before Campbell arrived in Honiara. In the interview, Andrews went on to say China “would be absolutely aware of the current members of the ministry, what their behaviour has been in the past, they would be looking at what opposition shadow ministers have said in the past”. Labor’s defence spokesperson and a former minister for home affairs, Brendan O’Connor, said Andrews was “so out of depth in her security portfolio she’s embarking on flights of conspiratorial fantasy”. Home Affairs Minister @karenandrewsmp is so out of depth in her security portfolio she’s embarking on flights of conspiratorial fantasy. The Govt won’t accept they have presided over one of the worst policy failures in the Pacific since WW2. When you mess up, fess up! #auspol https://t.co/tlAeMQIfTq Guardian Australia contacted Andrews’ office to ask whether the minister’s comments reflected assessments or briefings provided by Australian intelligence, whether she wished to clarify her remarks, and whether she would brief the opposition. The minister has yet to answer those questions. Her office referred the matter to the Coalition’s campaign headquarters, which emailed another copy of the 4BC transcript on Wednesday evening rather than addressing the questions. The head of Asio, Mike Burgess, has previously told a parliamentary committee that acts of foreign interference “would be drawn to the government’s attention and, during caretaker, be drawn to both parties’ attention”. It is understood Burgess’ intent has not changed. Earlier, the head of the Office of National Intelligence, Andrew Shearer, denied that an Australian intelligence failure was behind the deal. He told the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi on Tuesday that China had long been interested in expanding its presence across the Indo-Pacific. “I think for those of us watching closely there were signs of this well over a decade ago,” Shearer said. Morrison last week declined to comment on a report in the Nine newspapers that Australian intelligence may also have played a role in the leak of the draft agreement in March, saying he would “never comment on intelligence matters of that nature”.",News/Australia news,Labor ‘gravely concerned’ by Karen Andrews’ claim about potential China election interference,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/28/labor-gravely-concerned-by-karen-andrews-claim-about-potential-china-election-interference
4/28/2022,"Woodford is a long way from the Canberra bubble. That is, until an election nears, when those vying to lead the country develop a sudden and keen interest in marginal seats in Queensland. The electorally volatile seat of Longman lies just north of Brisbane, stretching from a fertile hinterland, home to the Woodford folk festival, down through a fast-growing corridor of new houses to the shores of Moreton Bay and Bribie Island. The diverse geography of the seat is reflected in its demographics, with farmers and alternative lifestylers rubbing shoulders in its western reaches, working class and young families in its heartland and retirees making up the bulk of the population around Bribie. Triennial rituals began this year well before the official start of the federal election campaign, when Scott Morrison toured the seat with Terry Young, the man who won it back from Labor in 2019. The pair rolled into Woodford in late January, nursing schooners at the Woodford Hotel and sipping coffees at Jalla’s Cafe. But if the Liberal leader won over voters on that trip, Bruce Pryde was not among them. Morrison is “probably worse” even than the former Queensland premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, Pryde says, perched at a table outside Jalla’s. Not that Labor are likely to benefit from Pryde’s damning assessment of the prime minister. “Albo’s a wet rag, a nothing really,” he says. Pryde, who was “cured of work” eight years ago, has voted Labor most of his life, dabbling occasionally with “the other mobs” such as the Greens. But at this election the retired water utility company worker will vote on a single issue that didn’t exist three years ago. Pryde will lodge a coronavirus “protest vote” against what he describes as “the big three”: the Liberals, Labor and Greens. That means he will vote for Clive Palmer’s United Australia party or Pauline Hanson’s One Nation for the first time. At another table sits Bianca Patruno, who “always went for the Greens” but recently drifted towards the Animal Justice party. The support worker says she doesn’t see much point in voting. From the housing crisis to support for mental health, the issues Patruno cares about don’t seem to be on the major parties’ radar. But Patruno agrees “the mandates were too controlling” and says she was “forced” to get a jab to keep her job. Others opted not to. Sharni Kate, a young mother carrying her toddler to the library playtime, says she quit her job as an early childhood teacher and took up dog grooming rather than receive a vaccine. Kate says she will vote for someone who is “against mandates” and that Palmer’s big yellow billboards are resonating. Her friend Sam Sewell, a 32-year-old mother of four, says she too was “trying to stand her ground” against the vaccine, but relented in order to keep her position as president of the Delaneys Creek state school P&C. She didn’t like it, but now that “the restrictions are dropped”, Sewell says Covid is not likely to influence her vote. Which sentiment is more widespread in the electorate may go a long way to determining the outcome of the seat. Young won Longman by a margin of 3.3% in 2019, despite a slight swing against the Liberal National party that reduced its primary vote to 38.59%. He was carried over the line on preferences after swings towards ​​One Nation (13.22% primary vote) and UAP (3.36%), as well as the Greens (6.71%). The seat has swapped hands at four of the past five federal elections, and events of the past three years could make it even more volatile, according Reece Casey, a 35-year-old tradie. Casey and his English staffy Lexi are camped in a stand of radiata pines on a 24-hectare horse stud on the road to Stanmore. The pair have been living off-grid for the last 18 months. Since the owners of the Morayfield townhouse he was renting fled Sydney’s lockdowns, Casey has been homeless. Casey says his generation has been “screwed” by a crisis in the housing market, exacerbated in Longman after thousands of people moved from southern states to south-east Queensland when the pandemic hit. But the former “class clown” of Caboolture East primary school says he was “born an optimist”. Casey has invested $18,000 in his tent home, and rents patches of bare ground from farmers for a fraction of what he was paying for a roof over his head. As he saves for a home loan, Casey also has plans to franchise his polyurethane and silicone joint sealing business. The young tradie says he has only ever voted Labor. But this time around, with the defence minister Peter Dutton beating the drums of war from nearby Dickson, Casey fears Labor is “too soft on China” and is considering voting for the LNP. “If we have to go to war, we have to go to war,” he says. As they compete for swing voters, the LNP and Labor can count on rusted-on supporters in different pockets of the 1,237 sq km electorate. Halfway down the D’Aguilar highway towards Caboolture is the district of Wamuran. Here, the Glass House Mountains provide a dramatic backdrop to a patchwork of strawberry and pineapple plantations, interspersed by groves of mangoes and bananas. Strawberry and herb farmers Mandy and Adrian Schultz say growers are grappling with a shortage of pickers. Though neither of the Schultzes describe themselves as party-affiliated, Labor was never likely to win their vote. “I think Albo is a good bloke,” Adrian says. “But he represents the unions and, to us, they’re like the mafia.” The minor parties are also unlikely to sway the Schultzes. Mandy says she has “been an idiot and voted Pauline in the past”, but won’t again. The couple cannot understand why Palmer is allowed to tell “bare-faced lies”. In contrast, Adrian thinks Morrison has done a “pretty good job overall”, particularly in his response to the pandemic. They have dealt with Young and have a positive impression of their MP. The benefits of incumbency are reinforced by Young’s dominance of billboards throughout the electorate and favourable local media coverage. But those messages will be lost on many in the heart of the electorate, a fast-growing belt of new houses centred on Caboolture and running down towards the outer northern suburbs of Brisbane. Raymond Totoro, the president of the Caboolture Snakes rugby league club, says working-class voters like him relate more to Albanese than the Labor leader’s predecessors. “He’s got a bit of, not Bob Hawke sparkle, but he’s got a little bit of something,” the delivery driver says. “He seems more down to earth than the last couple of leaders.” But Totoro says his biggest issue is a decidedly local one. The Snakes’ “spiritual home” by the banks of the Caboolture River “got smashed” in February’s floods, and with no lights, the seniors are training and playing elsewhere. Totoro says there is anger that the club has received no outreach, let alone support, from the federal government to rebuild. Opposite the Caboolture train station, a group of young men in high vis shoot pool at the Club Tavern. Jack Timms, 20, says his “words get all jumbled up” when asked about politics. But the young roofer talks to the issue that matters most to him with aplomb. “Petrol prices, living prices, everything is going up, except our wages,” he says. “Now we’re battling through, week to week, when we should be able to earn a decent wage for the work we do.” But, come 21 May, it may be another generation’s vote that proves decisive. Bribie Island and the mainland neighbourhoods on the other side of Pumicestone Passage are a mecca for retirees. Despite punishing Labor at the last federal election, older voters here backed the premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in 2020, with the popular local member Ali King winning the state seat of Pumicestone from the LNP with a swing of 6.1%. Federal Labor has ditched its policies on negative gearing and capital gains taxes which riled older voters in 2019. But the manager of the Bribie Island Community Arts Centre, a hub for retirees, wonders if Albanese and the Labor candidate Rebecca Fanning have done enough to win them back. “I don’t know how anyone out there would know who she is,” Julie Thomson says of Fanning. Inside one of the centre’s sheds run by the Bribie Island Gem and Fossicking Club, two retirees are cutting and shining rocks. Barry Anderson is a former radio announcer; his mate Bill Sargent was a livestock auctioneer. Asked to nominate the election issues that matter to them, they agree on a two-word answer: “My superannuation”. Anderson and Sargent are worried about petrol and grocery prices, and want to know their pension won’t be cut and the economy is well managed. But that concern will lead them to cast very different ballots. Anderson has little faith in the prime minister, who he derides for his “incompetence”. Sargent says he doesn’t “particularly like ScoMo”, but will vote LNP regardless. “I’m quite happy with the way the country is running at the moment,” he says. Really though, both men would rather talk gemstones. Most people think rocks are dull and brown, they reckon. But when cracked open and buffed, the rocks reveal a kaleidoscope of colours. Anderson examines a stone under a pocket microscope, before flicking on a black light, under whose rays any invisible flecks of ruby illuminate. Longman, too, reveals its colour as it is dissected and examined. But it will take the black light of the ballot box to reveal whose points of view and which issues prove most valuable.",News/Australia news,"In kaleidoscopic Longman, the status quo is dead.

4/28/2022,"About 420 public school teachers across Victoria have been stood down for failing to meet Covid vaccination requirements – with the majority of them not working because they haven’t received a third dose. Despite previous fears of staff shortages in schools, Guardian Australia understands there are 420 full-time-equivalent teachers across Victoria’s public school system who are unable to work as they have not met the state’s vaccination mandate. This means they have been placed on leave without pay and unable to work since the third dose deadline came into effect on 25 March. Of this figure, Guardian Australia understands that about 240 teachers – or 57% – have not met the requirement because they haven’t received a booster shot. This is in addition to about 180 teachers who were stood down after failing to receive a first or second dose of a vaccine last year. Victoria and the Northern Territory are the only jurisdictions that require teachers to be triple-dosed. In New South Wales, unvaccinated teachers will be able to begin working in the state’s schools from mid-May. The Australian Medical Association Victorian president, Dr Roderick McRae, said the state’s challenges with getting people to have third dose of a Covid vaccine were partly due to “language confusion” over its necessity. In February, the national immunisation panel shifted its messaging from “fully vaccinated” to urging people to be “up to date” with a third booster shot. “There’s been information overload in the community. Government insists on using the expression ‘fully vaccinated’ [for two doses] but it’s a complete oxymoron,” McRae said. “Within healthcare we are aware the third dose has been absolutely, fundamentally crucial in the management of the Omicron variant as the level of protection wanes over time.” The latest department of health figures show almost 95% of Victorians aged over 12 are double vaccinated. But little over two-thirds – 67.5% – of Victorians aged over 18 have received three doses. Since the beginning of the year, unvaccinated Victorian teachers have been unable to receive leave entitlements. In line with Department of Education leave guidelines, employees who failed to meet the March deadline to receive a third dose were placed on unauthorised leave, which will result in termination of employment. But the exact timing would vary from school to school and depend on how long a teacher had been on unauthorised leave, if they were fixed-term employees, when they had their second Covid vaccination jab and became eligible for a booster. A department of spokesperson said that as of Tuesday, 99.2% of public school teachers have had three doses of a Covid vaccine and were permitted to attend work. “We encourage any staff members who have not yet had their third dose to book in to protect themselves, their families and their school communities,” the spokesperson said. This month, the Victorian government scrapped the seven-day isolation rule for household Covid contacts and loosened other restrictions after the state passed the peak of an Omicron wave. But unlike NSW, Victoria did not set a date for scrapping its wide-ranging vaccine mandates. Frontline critical workers such as healthcare employees, education staff and food transport workers require three doses to work in Victoria. The Victorian Transport Association has opposed the mandate, estimating about 20% of drivers had left the industry due to the vaccine requirement. The premier, Daniel Andrews, has also flagged the state could end its pandemic declaration in July, which would result in remaining health orders – including vaccine mandates – being scrapped. Some epidemiologists have called on the state to relax its vaccine mandates. But the Andrews government has argued the mandates have allowed the state to reach its high vaccination rate.",News/Australia news,Victoria stands down 420 public school teachers over vaccine mandates,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/28/victoria-stands-down-420-public-school-teachers-over-vaccine-mandates
4/28/2022,"The Greens will push for a new levy on coal exports to fund climate disaster recovery and clean export industries if they hold the balance of power after the election. In a climate policy to be launched in Sydney on Thursday, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, will announce measures that the party says will improve the budget bottom line by $51.9bn over a decade and create 805,000 new jobs. As the Coalition fought internally over its net zero emissions policy, Bandt said the Greens were the only party talking seriously about addressing the climate emergency and the package dismantled the argument that action should be delayed. “The Coalition and Labor are arguing over whether to go over the climate cliff at 200 km/h or 180 km/h,” he said. “They’ve both got targets that are far too late and they’re backing more coal and gas. “The Greens have a plan to phase out coal exports and levy the coal corporations to help pay for the damage they’re causing and to grow new, clean industries with secure jobs.” Bandt said the party’s climate platform, which had been costed by the parliamentary budget office, was comprehensive and would move Australia to a “jobs-rich zero pollution economy”. The climate package includes a new levy on thermal and metallurgical coal that would start at $1 and $3 a tonne respectively in the first year and increase annually, raising $21.7b over a decade. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The money would support recovery and resilience programs as climate-related disasters and extreme weather events increased due to the emissions caused by the fossil fuel industry. It would also be invested in green hydrogen and green metals development. It would be coupled with a plan to phase out thermal coal exports, with a yearly export cap to cut the maximum annual thermal coal exports from 230m tonnes in 2023 to zero by 2030. Other elements of the plan include a moratorium on new coal, oil and gas development and ending billions of dollars paid each year in fossil fuel subsidies. Bandt said this would include cutting the diesel fuel rebate for vehicles not used on public roads. The Greens have a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2035, and negative emissions growing to 100m tonnes by 2050. On energy, their target is to reach 100% renewable energy by 2030. The eventual goal is to reach 700% renewable energy compared with today’s output to allow Australia to become a “renewable energy superpower”, with new green manufacturing and export industries. The minor party proposes subsidies for households to electrify heating and cooking and to install batteries, which they said would generate $44.5bn investment in homes and businesses. They also propose creating a $25bn “futuregrid” fund to enable the rewiring of the electricity network and connect new renewable energy zones with major cities. This pledge has similarities to Labor’s commitment to create a $20bn “rewiring the nation” corporation. Bandt said support for coal and gas workers and their communities was central to the policy. He has visited Rockhampton, Gladstone, Newcastle and Singleton to talk about the plan, which includes an already announced $19b jobs guarantee to subsidise the wages and employment of coal workers for up to 10 years, and subsidising older workers until retirement age. “Coal and gas workers can see the world is moving and they are looking to governments for leadership,” he said. “Right now, the Coalition and Labor are refusing to have honest conversations which just leaves communities in the lurch.”",News/Australia news,"Greens unveil climate policy including coal export levy, renewable energy and net zero by 2035",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/28/greens-to-push-for-coal-export-levy-if-they-hold-balance-of-power
4/28/2022,"The Morrison government has directed an extra $10bn to private schools since 2018 while public schools are underfunded by at least $6.5bn every year, according to a new report. The study by education economist Adam Rorris, commissioned by the Australian Education Union, details the legacy of special treatment of private schools including $4.6bn of transitional funding after the Gonski 2.0 reforms and $750m of jobkeeper wage subsidies. The teacher’s union is concerned that the Coalition has not promised additional schools funding ahead of the May election while Labor has committed only to a “pathway” to full funding of public schools. In 2017 the Turnbull government legislated schools funding reforms which promise 80% of the schools resourcing standard to non-government schools, and 20% to public schools, to be topped up by a further 75% from states. Despite Scott Morrison arguing against “special deals” while treasurer, after he succeeded Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister he agreed to a $4.6bn deal to ease non-government schools’ transition to the new funding model including a $1.2bn “choice and affordability” fund not accessible to public schools. Transition arrangements will see non-government schools continue to receive more than 80% of the resourcing standard until 2028. These include Haileybury in Victoria, which will get a total of $25m above that level from 2022 to 2028; Trinity grammar school in NSW with an extra $16.8m; Monte Saint Angelo in NSW with $15.3m; and Brisbane grammar school with $13.9m. According to the report, public schools will receive $4.7bn less than full funding in 2022 including a gap of $1.4bn in New South Wales, $1.3bn in Victoria, $1.3bn in Queensland, $288m in Western Australia and $188m in both the Northern Territory and South Australia. This amounts to a funding gap of $1,633 a student in NSW, $2,155 in Queensland and a whopping $6,125 in the NT. States and territories are also responsible for this gap, with many slowly ramping up to their 75% share in agreements negotiated with the commonwealth. In 2022 those funding less than 75% include: NSW (71.8%), Victoria (69.7%), Queensland (69.3%), Tasmania (73.9%) and NT (58.5%). The report accuses the Coalition of using further “accounting trickery” by allowing states to count non-recurrent costs, such as capital depreciation; the cost of education standards bodies; and in some cases transport costs towards their share. When these measures, worth a maximum of 4% of the resourcing standard, are stripped out the “true” public school funding shortfall is $6.7bn in 2022 or at least $6.5bn a year, it said. Other instances of special treatment cited in the report include $1.9bn in capital funding grants available to private schools and $750m in jobkeeper wage subsidies for private schools during the Covid-19 pandemic. The report also cites an extra $2bn for private schools in the 2021 mid-year economic update. The government says this reflects “increased student enrolments and support of needs-based disability loading”, although the report questions why public school funding was not similarly projected to increase given the “vast majority of students with disability attend public schools”. The AEU federal president, Correna Haythorpe, said the Morrison government had “shamelessly established and consolidated a deep inequity in Australian education, to the detriment of the overwhelming majority of students who attend public schools”. “Every child, irrespective of their circumstances, should have a high quality education,” she said. “But this government has made a series of very deliberate choices to undermine this principle.” In February the acting education minister, Stuart Robert, said that since 2013 when the Coalition was elected, federal funding “per student for all schools increased significantly in real terms”. “Government schools have been the biggest beneficiary of this growth, with commonwealth-per-student funding growing by 64.1% in real terms over the past 10 years compared with 49.8% in non-government schools,” he said. Despite increases in absolute terms, the AEU-commissioned report notes the Coalition reneged on its commitment at the 2013 election to match Labor’s schools funding, cutting $30bn of projected funding growth in the 2014 budget. Before the 2019 election Labor promised $14bn over 10 years for public education, but has not recommitted to the policy, citing the fact current agreements run to the end to 2023 and need to be renegotiated with the states. The shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, has said Labor will “work with every state and territory to get every school on a pathway to reaching its fair funding level”. The AEU will be spending $3.5m on its election campaign, which calls for “every school, every child” to receive fair education funding and says that “Morrison must go” to achieve this. Haythorpe said “public schools cannot afford another three years of the Coalition government”.",News/Australia news,"Private schools received an extra $10bn funding in Coalition ‘special deals’, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/28/private-schools-received-an-extra-10bn-funding-in-coalition-special-deals-study-finds
4/28/2022,"Outer suburban electorates of major cities, already home to many of Australia’s most financially stressed households, are facing a “huge cliff” in coming years as their fixed-rate loans expire and they are hit with higher interest rates, analysts say. Inflation data for the March quarter, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday, underscored the rising cost of housing. New dwellings costs rose 13.7% – the biggest quarterly rise since the GST started in September 2000 – while rents resumed rising in Melbourne and Sydney and became more costly in other capitals. But it was the surprise jump in both the headline and underlying inflation, easily exceeding market predictions, that will probably sharpen the pain by bringing forward and increasing the size of interest rate rises by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Market economists had mostly assumed the RBA could hold off lifting its cash rate from its record low of 0.1% until June – after next month’s federal election. But three of the big four commercial banks now expect an RBA rate rise next Tuesday, with rates rising steadily for months to ensure inflation doesn’t spiral out of control. Data collected last year by researchers from the University of New South Wales found that of the 12 electorates where the majority of households were already under financial stress, nine were in outer metropolitan regions. Interesting analysis by UNSW on which electorates have the highest financial stress - which presumably will be made worse as interest rates start to rise. (This data is from last year.) #ausvotes #AusVotes2022 #auspol pic.twitter.com/uWEiIK1wIw “It’s not strictly speaking mortgage stress,” Prof Hal Pawson from UNSW said. “It’s people who are in financial stress who also have a mortgage.” Those outer suburbs, mostly held by Labor, often include higher ratios of first-home buyers, some lured by government schemes during the Covid crisis. Many of these owners will have bought in near the top of the market and will not yet be in a position to earn pay rises since they bought, Pawson said. An early RBA rate increase is not crucial in itself – other than causing political grief for the government this side of an election. But markets are already lifting rates and a bigger inflation number means future lending rates will probably be higher. The National Australia Bank, for instance, has already lifted fixed rates on four-year loans by almost three percentage points – from 1.98% to 4.79% – in the past year, according to RateCity.com.au. “There’s going to potentially be a huge cliff in two or three years’ time when their fixed-rate loan runs out because they’ll have to refinance,” Pawson said. For those on an average mortgage of $600,000, adding three percentage points to the borrowing costs could swell repayments by $1,500 a month or more. “That’s going to be a lot for any household to swallow.” Households surveyed by UNSW were deemed to be in stress if their residual funds after normal expenditure, including for housing, was less than 5% of income. RateCity takes a more conservative assessment. It applied Westpac’s predictions – made before Wednesday’s inflation shock – that the RBA would hold off on lifting its cash rate until June but progressively lift it to peak at 2% by next May. Average loan sizes were taken from the latest ABS data for February and released earlier this month. Borrowers were assumed to be on 25-year mortgages. By these calculations, the impact on those households with $500,000 loans would be an increase in monthly repayments averaging $513 by May 2023. While less than UNSW’s estimates, the impact of higher rates will still be significant, particularly as other costs such as fuel and food would probably be rising as well, according to Sally Tindall, a senior researcher at RateCity. “There’s going to be some households that really have to take a long hard look at their budgets, and potentially make hefty cuts in numerous places to just keep their heads above water and their mortgage repayments up,” Tindall said. “We’re looking down the barrel at not just one rate hike in isolation. There’s going to be multiple hikes.” Inflation figures “have been blown out of the water”, so even if the RBA held off a month, there was still a lot of work to be done to curb inflation, she said. Data from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority showed the average mortgage holder had made the most of the Covid support payments – and limited spending opportunities – to be 45 months ahead on repayments. That tally, though, was an average and a lot people wouldn’t enjoy so large a buffer, Tindall said. Those borrowers who lately had a change of circumstances – such as an added child to the family, a change of job or a business snarled by Covid – may struggle to make higher repayments. In addition, “anyone who bought recently and potentially overstretched themselves to get into an overheated property market, they will feel the heat of these rate hikes, that’s for certain”, Tindall said.",News/Australia news,"Homeowners in outer suburbs could face ‘huge cliff’ as inflation and rates rise, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/28/homeowners-in-outer-suburbs-could-face-huge-cliff-as-inflation-and-rates-rise-experts-say
4/28/2022,"This time of year brings bad memories for families of care home residents who died in Covid’s first wave when the virus swept, mostly unchecked, through nursing homes. Just over two years on, the high court ruling that the government’s hospital discharge policy which sent thousands of people untested into care homes was not only illegal but “irrational”, comes as bitter proof of something they already knew: something went badly wrong. Cathy Gardner and Fay Harris were the two grieving daughters who secured the ruling in the face of vigorous denials of wrongdoing by the government. But it also provides justice for the families of many of the 12,500 care home residents who perished with Covid in March and April 2020, some of whom, campaigners insist, could have been saved. Among them was Charlie Williams, whose father Rex, 85, was one of 27 people who died in his Coventry care home. “The last two years of cover-ups and denials have been unbelievably painful,” he said. “We’ve always known that our loved ones were thrown to the wolves by the government, and the claims made by Matt Hancock that a ‘protective ring’ was made around care homes was a sickening lie. Now a court has found their decisions unlawful and it’s clear the decisions taken led to people dying who may otherwise still be with their loved ones today.” Another relative absorbing the ruling was Lindsay Jackson whose mother, Sylvia, died in a Derbyshire care home on 17 April 2020. “It’s an affirmation of what many of us believed to be the case,” Jackson said. “But to have it in black and white that your government has disregarded our most vulnerable people and hung them out to dry is really shocking. We are all led to believe the first requirement of a government is to keep its citizens safe. Not only did they not do that, they actively put them in harm’s way.” The case could help families bring compensation claims but also offers a preview of the statutory coronavirus public inquiry due to start this spring in which interactions between ministers, officials and scientists as they wrestled with life-and-death decisions will be laid bare. In this case, for example, it emerged that the care minister Helen Whately asked of draft admissions guidance that did not require negative tests: “Why are we not planning to test patients for discharge to the care sector? This would make such a difference.” She also wrote: “This is written like the NHS is divine and care homes are slaves.” That sense that social care was a secondary priority remains in the wake of Wednesday’s verdict. “The attitude of the government was to put a protective ring of steel around the NHS and leave care homes to fend for themselves,” said Nadra Ahmed, the executive chair of the National Care Association, which represents independent care operators. “Care homes continue to support their residents and staff through very choppy waters. Any supportive funding for our sector has stopped and we are being left to wait for the crumbs from the NHS rebuilding programme before we see any support, with no plan to rebuild social care.” The judges found that “those drafting the March [2020] discharge policy and the April [2020] admissions guidance simply failed to take into account the highly relevant consideration of the risk to elderly and vulnerable residents from asymptomatic transmission”. They concluded that the decisions of the health secretary, then Matt Hancock, “to make and maintain” the policies on how hospital patients could be sent to care homes were unlawful because, in deciding to adopt the policies, he failed to take into accountthe risk from asymptomatic transmission. A Downing Street spokesperson said ministers had “sought to act informed by the evidence we had – clinical or otherwise – and the capabilities we had available at the time”. They added: “What we’ve seen throughout this pandemic is that we have acted to get that balance between saving lives and livelihoods.”",News/Politics,‘Thrown to the wolves’: Covid care home ruling is bitter victory for relatives,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/27/thrown-to-the-wolves-covid-care-home-ruling-is-bitter-victory-for-relatives
4/28/2022,"Members of the DP World Tour who play in the $25m (£19.9m Saudi Arabian-backed event in Hertfordshire in June are likely to face penalties amid a growing sense permission will not be granted to those looking to tee up at the Centurion Club. DP World – formerly European – Tour players must request a release to participate in the LIV Golf Invitational, which runs from 9 to 11 June. This marks the first independent event fronted by Greg Norman, whose disruption plan for golf – backed by Saudi’s Public Investment Fund – has met with stern resistance from the sport’s biggest tours. Players were released by the DP World Tour for the Saudi International this year but that tournament carried world-ranking value and was endorsed by the Asian Tour. Neither applies to the LIV Golf Invitational. The DP World Tour is now set to bite back. Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter, Sergio García, Richard Bland, Graeme McDowell, Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace are among those likely to apply for the release before the DP World Tour’s deadline of 10 May. Every indication from their Wentworth headquarters is that players will not be cleared to play at Centurion. That will leave those individuals with a decision to make: take their place in the field anyway or remove their names from the equation. If golfers opt for the former, and barring an unforeseen U-turn, they would face punishment. Nobody at the DP World Tour is willing to speculate on what that may be leaving players themselves in the midst of a high-stakes guessing game. Keith Pelley, chief executive of the DP World Tour, again urged members last week to consider the potential long-term ramifications – on both sporting and ethical grounds – of siding with the Saudis. The PGA Tour’s position on its members – including Phil Mickelson, Robert Garrigus, Bubba Watson and Harold Varner – who want to play at Centurion is slightly different. Unlike the DP World Tour, the PGA Tour must respond to players who have requested a release by 10 May. Insiders believe the PGA Tour may be more strict for LIV competitions in North America than one due to place in the UK. Mickelson remains absent from professional golf after controversial comments relating to Saudi Arabia’s record on human rights came to light and it remains unclear whether he will re-emerge to defend the US PGA Championship next month.",Sport/Sport,Breakaway league sets golfers on collision course with DP World Tour,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/27/breakaway-league-sets-golfers-on-collision-course-with-dp-world-tour
4/28/2022,"Your leading article (25 April) is right to point to Emmanuel Macron’s urgent task: to tackle the reasons that led more than 40% of French electors to support a candidate with diametrically opposite views to his own. However, the huge underlying problem that will constrain that task is the lack of values-based political parties across the whole spectrum to the left of Marine Le Pen’s far-right movement. In 2017, Macron entered the political world without any party affiliation and was elected as president as a consequence of a series of accidents that neither he nor the French parties could have foreseen. Both the major parties of right and left imploded as a consequence of their own internal problems and Macron’s En Marche leapt into the vacuum. That party vacuum continued through to Sunday’s election but, with Macron constitutionally barred from standing again in 2027, he has five short years to establish the foundations for a healthy party system. Governments are never stable without parties based on some semblance of political philosophy, and the divide in France that your article stresses can only be narrowed by electoral competition based on parties rather than personalities. The major parties may seem dead, but they still have deep roots in the regional and local assemblies and they dominate the French Senate. By 2027, Macron’s party will not have Macron, and the focus of the “old” parties should be on filling the new vacuum that will then exist.Michael MeadowcroftLeeds  In order to avoid a move even closer towards the normalisation of fascism, Emmanuel Macron does not need to move closer to the right but instead needs to look to the left. The notion that by pandering to the toxic ideologies of the extreme right we somehow dilute them is flawed; it only leads to a more extreme-right politics. We see this here in the UK with a Conservative party that has now pandered for some years to the brutally racist ideas of forces such as Ukip. By assuming policies like Theresa May’s hostile environment, this led to the Windrush scandal, and more recently to the horrifying dehumanisation of asylum seekers as needing “processing” (like tax returns rather than people) in Rwanda. Only by seeking an alternative on the left can an inclusive ideology that repudiates the extreme right be found.Dr Anne LukeHarrogate, North Yorkshire  Timothy Garton Ash (25 April) notes that “widespread unhappiness with the liberal centre and ‘Europe’ is a result of many causes”, but fails to recognise as key Emmanuel Macron’s role in making the working class pay for the security of the “liberal centre”. As Macron campaigned, workers at BioMérieux, Dassault, Safran, Hutchinson, Lustucru and the RATP were striking for wage increases. It is estimated that, to meet increases in the cost of living, French workers need a minimum wage of €2,000 (£1,670). Macron offered them a €100 chèque énergie and the prospect of an extended retirement age. We will not solve the problems faced by the poor through pretending that Macron is anything other than the representative of the rich. Far from being Napoleon, Macron is more like a Lebrun paving the way for Le Pen’s Pétain.Nick MossLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/28/2022,"Ben Stokes is expected to be named as England Test captain on Thursday when Rob Key holds his first media conference since becoming the managing director of men’s cricket. Key offered the role to Stokes on Tuesday during face-to-face talks in the north-east and though the 30‑year‑old all‑rounder always played down any captaincy ambitions during his time as Joe Root’s deputy, he has accepted the challenge. The appointment of a Test captain requires sign-off from the England and Wales Cricket Board’s independent board but while it is in flux – Martin Darlow was announced on Wednesday as the new interim chair – Key’s fresh mandate since taking charge of the men’s national teams 10 days ago has made this a formality. Given a paucity of credible alternatives in the Test side, Stokes was always the outright favourite to take over after an exhausted Root called time on his five-year tenure in the wake of England’s winless winter in Australia and the Caribbean. Nevertheless, Key still needed to meet Stokes to establish his hunger for this additional responsibility, both as a linchpin of the Test side with bat and ball and having taken a four-month break last year for his mental health. Stokes has captained the Test team – a four-wicket defeat against West Indies in Southampton two years ago when Root was on paternity leave – but it remains his only first‑class match in charge. That said, he has long been a leader in the dressing room and earned plaudits when captaining a rookie one-day international team to a 3-0 series win against Pakistan last year after a Covid-19 outbreak ruled out the first‑choice squad. His first appearance as the permanent England captain and an 80th cap will come against his country of birth, New Zealand, when a three-Test series gets under way at Lord’s on 2 June. It remains to be seen if Stokes will have a head coach alongside him, however, with the interview process for the vacancy not starting until 9 May. While the likes of Gary Kirsten, Graham Ford and Simon Katich vie for that role, another position needing to be filled is that of Test vice-captain. Often used to blood future leaders, it may require an experienced head, initially, given the likelihood that Stokes, a full-throttle cricketer who is nursing a knee problem, may well miss games along the way. Root appears unlikely to step in while he focuses his energies on batting, and the only other batter assured of his spot is Jonny Bairstow after centuries in Sydney and Antigua this year. Should the England hierarchy decide to invest in a younger player, Zak Crawley – mentored by Key during his career – is a candidate. There is also an expectation that Stuart Broad – down to start his season with Nottinghamshire on Thursday – and Jimmy Anderson will feature in the Test team this summer, with Stokes understood to be in favour of the veteran pair returning to the selection fold after they were controversially dropped for the Caribbean tour. It is one of a number of topics likely to be covered by Key at Lord’s on Thursday during his first public appearance as director of men’s cricket, along with the 42-year-old’s decision to split the head-coach roles by way of format and his overall vision for the men’s game at both international and at the domestic level. Some semblance of a plan will be welcome, given there is a leadership vacuum at the very top of the ECB. On Wednesday the governing body confirmed it has been forced to restart the recruitment process for the role of permanent ECB chair that has been vacant since Ian Watmore resigned last October. Ron Kalifa, a non-executive director on the board for the past 18 months, was previously in charge of the search but now appears likely to run for the role of chair himself after a statement from ECB confirmed “no single candidate was able to fully meet the criteria”. Barry O’Brien, interim chair for the past eight months, has also stepped down for health reasons, with his deputy, Darlow, taking over until the role is filled. Meanwhile, the England all-rounder Chris Woakes has signed a two-year contract extension with Warwickshire until at least the end of the 2024 season.",Sport/Sport,Ben Stokes to be rubber-stamped as England Test captain,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/27/ben-stokes-to-be-rubber-stamped-as-england-test-captain
4/28/2022,"Tim Higginson (Letters, 24 April) asserts the longstanding convention that police forces retain operational independence from both central government and police and crime commissioners (PCCs). In so doing, he makes a strong point that any attempt by the government to direct the police in operational matters would be gross political interference and legally unenforceable. However, the presumption of operational independence has been challenged, which raises concerns about the potential for political intrusion. Although the doctrine of operational independence appears to have been firmly endorsed by the recent Police Foundation strategic review, it failed to mention a 2017 high court judgment that challenged this doctrine (R v Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire Police). This judgment, in making the PCC responsible for all operational policing activity, questions the tradition of constabulary independence. This clearly requires further testing in the courts. If the judgment is upheld, it would enable PCCs, 85% of whom are active Conservatives, to exercise political direction in operational policing matters.Dr Roy BaileyCrowthorne, Berkshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
