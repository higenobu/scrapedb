1/23/2022,"Pressure is building on the Metropolitan police from Conservative MPs who want the force to investigate Downing Street’s lockdown parties regardless of the findings of the Sue Gray report this week. Although many MPs have said that they are withholding judgment until the outcome of the Gray inquiry, some believe that the details of what is already publicly known are sufficient to merit police action.  The Met’s stance, reiterated again on Saturday, is that it is content to wait for the result of the inquiry from the senior civil servant before deciding whether to investigate if potential criminal offences are unearthed. Since news of the first party emerged, opposition MPs have been calling for the Met to investigate, but backbench Tory MPs are now also urging the force to step in. Martin Vickers, Conservative MP for Cleethorpes since 2010, last week told constituents that “disciplinary actions, and possibly prosecutions, should follow”. “The truth is that none of this should have happened, I despair at the management structure in Downing Street that this could happen,” Vickers told the Observer last night. He added that Boris Johnson – whose political career is largely seen as resting on the contents of Gray’s report – should have left the notorious party held at in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020 soon after he arrived. “Those of us who know how these things work can see how it happened. The staff were gathering [in the garden] and somebody said: ‘Nip upstairs and see if the boss can come down and give us a pep talk’. “When the senior person got there they should have said: ‘Drink up and go home.’” Other Tories have also called for police intervention with Andrew Selous, MP for South West Bedfordshire, telling constituents he supports a Met investigation into the party allegations. “I want every one of these allegations to be fully and independently investigated, if necessary, by the police and I want all of those, however senior, who have broken the law or government guidance to be appropriately punished,” he told constituents. Another Conservative MP, Stephen Crabb, has also called for the Metropolitan Police to “investigate these gatherings.” “It makes me feel extremely disappointed and genuinely let down,” Crabb, MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire, told constituents last week. It came as banners reading “Boot him out! - Stop Boris.com” were flown over Premier League matches held at Old Trafford in Manchester and Elland Road in Leeds on Saturday. The campaign group Open Britain told the PA news agency it had booked the aircraft. The website displayed on the banner links to a petition calling for the Prime Minister to be “removed from power”, which currently has more than 77,000 signatures. The Met’s explanation that they rarely investigate breaches of Covid law retrospectively has prompted disquiet among some and prompted claims it has allowed the force to shy away from a contentious episode. The force though may yet be dragged into the broader fallout of “partygate” after a Conservative backbencher, who accused Downing Street of attempting to “blackmail” MPs seeking to oust Johnson, confirmed on Saturday that he is to meet police to discuss the allegations. William Wragg said he will be speaking to a Met Police detective in the House of Commons this week and has requested a meeting with the force. However, many believe that Gray’s report will fall short of pulling in the police to investigate the prime minister over party’s at Downing Street. “I suspect the report will use words like ‘inappropriate’ and ‘bad judgement’ and Boris can cope with that,” said Vickers. “The only possibility of him falling is that it says it was against the law. It all depends on the phraseology to a great extent.” He also said that in terms of public fury it fell short of the anger caused by the trip made by Dominic Cummings to Barnard Castle during the first 2020 lockdown, saying that incident led to 900 emails from constituents compared to around 250 over partygate. Ironically, Cummings, Johnson’s former top aide, has driven much of the negative headlines about the prime minister, claiming that his former boss lied about lockdown parties and was also warned about the 20 May event.",News/Politics,Tory MPs back calls for criminal investigation into partygate,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/22/tory-mps-back-calls-for-criminal-investigation-into-partygate
1/23/2022,"The Arizona Democratic party has formally censured Kyrsten Sinema, the US senator whose opposition to filibuster reform helped sink attempts to protect voting rights. In a statement on Saturday the Arizona party chair, Raquel Terán, said: “While we take no pleasure in this announcement, the ADP executive board has decided to formally censure Senator Sinema as a result of her failure to do whatever it takes to ensure the health of our democracy.”  The attempt to pass voting rights legislation died in the Senate this week, dealing a huge blow to Joe Biden and his party in a year which finishes with midterm elections in which Republicans are expected to prosper. Sinema and another moderate Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, opposed a move to carve voting rights issues out of the filibuster, the Senate rule by which most legislation requires 60 votes to progress. Saying she opposed reform because the filibuster protected the rights of the Senate minority, Sinema said in a floor speech she was “committed to doing my part to avoid toxic political rhetoric to build bridges, to forge common ground, and to achieve lasting results for Arizona and this country”. Critics pointed out that no only do Republican senators in the 50-50 chamber represent millions fewer Americans than Democrats, but the GOP itself was recently happy to change filibuster rules to require only a simple majority to confirm supreme court justices. With that change made, Donald Trump was able to nominate three hardline conservatives to a court which had already, when more evenly balanced, gutted federal voting rights protections. Since that supreme court decision, in 2013, and at a growing pace since Trump refused to concede defeat in the 2020 election, Republican-run state governments have passed laws which critics say make it harder for communities which lean Democratic to vote – particularly Black voters. Other measures, critics say, will make it easier for Republicans to overturn results. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, stoked uproar this week when, after the failure of the Democratic voting rights push, he said: “The concern is misplaced, because if you look at the statistics, African American voters are voting in just as high a percentage as Americans.” Diana DeGette, a Democratic representative from Colorado, said: “African-American voters ARE AMERICANS and to suggest otherwise is about as racist as it gets.” In her statement on Saturday, Terán said: “The Arizona Democratic party is a diverse coalition with plenty of room for policy disagreements. “However, on the matter of the filibuster and the urgency to protect voting rights, we have been crystal clear in the choice between an archaic legislative norm and protecting Arizonans rights to vote. We choose the latter and we always will.” Terán praised Sinema’s role in passing Covid relief and a bipartisan infrastructure bill, key parts of Biden’s agenda. But she also highlighted Republican attempts to audit and overturn Trump’s defeat in Arizona and new election laws being passed nationwide. “The ramifications of failing to pass federal legislation that protects [the] right to vote are too large and far reaching,” she said. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and leading progressive, said this week he could back primary challengers to Manchin and Sinema when they come up for re-election in 2024. Sinema also saw Emily’s List, a powerful abortion rights group with deep ties to Democrats, withhold an endorsement. On Saturday, Sinema’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The effects of censure by a state party are debatable. In Arizona, the Republican John McCain was censured in 2014 for what his state party deemed too liberal a voting record. The senator and 2008 presidential nominee took it in his stride, as part of his public image as a political maverick. Sinema won the Arizona Senate seat vacated by Jeff Flake, an anti-Trump conservative and also presents herself as unbound by traditional political codes. Last year, Chuck Coughlin, a former Republican operative in the state, said Sinema was a “pragmatist” who “understands that if she is to succeed in Arizona, she must succeed in this lane”. However, Saundra Cole, a Democrat who once campaigned for Sinema, saw her opposition to a federal minimum wage increase as “a slap in the face”. “She’s not John McCain,” Cole said. “She’s not a maverick. I didn’t agree with him on many things but at least we knew where he stood.” Additional reporting by Lauren Gambino",News/US news,Arizona Democrats censure Kyrsten Sinema for voting rights failure,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/22/arizona-censure-kyrsten-sinema-voting-rights
1/23/2022,"It felt like an end, not a beginning. Internazionale had just gone 2-0 down at home to Torino with half an hour to play and, as the camera panned to the touchline, Antonio Conte bore the expression of a man who had accepted an invitation to dinner only to discover that the menu would be entirely vegan. His side had won three of their opening seven games of the 2020-21 season and were eighth in Serie A. The prospect of mounting any sort of challenge for the scudetto seemed laughably remote. At which point, something stirring and strange happened. Alexis Sánchez pulled one back after a goalmouth scramble. Romelu Lukaku bundled in a scruffy equaliser and then converted a contentious penalty with six minutes remaining.  Inter ended up winning 4-2 and with the benefit of hindsight – because who can really know these things at the time? – it was the point when all the pieces began to fall into place. Powered by the raw fumes of that comeback Inter went on a run of seven more straight wins that would set them on course for their first title in 11 years. This is one of the hallmarks of Conte’s most successful teams: the moment when they seem at their weakest is the moment from which they draw their greatest strength. At some indeterminate point, whether through circumstance or epiphany, everything just clicks. The origins of Conte’s 2016-17 title win with Chelsea came in a famous half-time tactical switch during a 3-0 defeat to Arsenal. It was a 4-1 mauling against Germany that convinced Conte to try the 3-5-2 system that ended up taking Italy to the quarter-finals of Euro 2016. As Conte’s Tottenham pulled off a remarkable 3-2 victory at Leicester on Wednesday, it was tempting to wonder whether we were witnessing another such moment. Trailing 2-1 five minutes into stoppage time, Tottenham improbably stole all three points with two Steven Bergwijn goals, igniting uncontrolled celebrations in the away end, on the pitch and on the touchline. For a club that has spent much of the past three years in a sort of waking sleep, this felt new and bracing. Would we look back on those two wild minutes as the point the Conte revolution finally began to take flight? The first thing to say is that Tottenham have been playing decent football for a while now. It may be hard to unpick all the various narrative strands: the Covid interruptions, the humiliation at NS Mura, the elimination from Europe, twice being outclassed by Chelsea in the Carabao Cup, Conte grumbling about transfers, the slow egress of the club’s record signing, Tanguy Ndombele. But in a parallel universe, Tottenham are yet to lose in the Premier League under Conte. Only Manchester City have won more points a game since his arrival. Even before the Miracle of the King Power, the foundations of a resurgence were being built. But all good uprisings need an origin story, a moment of growth, and this is where Conte comes in. For all his reputation as a quick-fix, shock-therapy coach, his methods rarely bear immediate fruit. Indeed, the early days of a Conte stewardship are often rich in conflict and reluctance, the sound of an expert Italian bullshit-detector sniffing around the place and deciding who needs to stay, who needs to go and who needs a double dose of yo-yo tests and a strict keto diet. “Better to create a deep wound that will lead to an even deeper healing,” Conte’s fitness coach, Giampiero Ventrone, told FourFourTwo in 2017. “The bigger the disruption, the better the results. At first the impact is severe: the players react badly. But after two or three months the situation changes. While the player is complaining, there’s a change in him that will ultimately lead to improvement. The results arrive.” The sight of Ventrone screaming at Tottenham’s fringe players as he put them through a series of gruelling post-match sprints early in the Conte reign offers just a hint of the confrontational leadership to which the squad has already been subjected. But the remoulding process goes beyond simple physical coercion and is much more dialectic than is often assumed. Tactically and psychologically, Conte tries to drill a win-at-all-costs habit into his players. But only when that improvement is borne out in the shape of tangible results does it really begin to make sense. Until then, it’s just a very angry middle-aged man shouting about spaces and desire. This is why the Leicester game felt like such a watershed. From front to back – and with the caveat that they still look defensively brittle – Tottenham demonstrated a vigour and purpose that was painfully absent during Nuno Espírito Santo’s miserable tenure. The sight of Harry Kane getting off 10 shots – many of them admittedly stupid efforts from distance – was nevertheless a sign the England captain may just have begun to back himself again. Tottenham visit Stamford Bridge on Sunday. It is the third time these teams have met in the space of three weeks and on the first two occasions the gulf between them was sharply evident. By the same token these are two clubs on very different trajectories: one doubting themselves, one believing. Are Tottenham still imprisoned by their flaws or have they really turned the corner? Sunday afternoon seems as good a time as any to find out.",Sport/Football,Tottenham uprising gains sense of origin story with Antonio Conte | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/22/tottenham-uprising-gains-sense-of-origin-story-with-antonio-conte
1/23/2022,"Gardaí have launched an investigation after two men carried a dead body into an Irish post office in an apparent attempt to claim his pension. The deceased pensioner was described in reports as being “propped up” by the men as they walked into the building in County Carlow on Friday morning.  The outlandish series of events began when one of the men entered the post office at about 11.30am on Friday, asking to collect a pension payment for an older man, the Irish Times reported. He was refused, with staff informing him that the pensioner would have to be present in order for the money to be handed over. The man returned soon after with two other men, one of whom was in his 60s and appeared to be being supported by the two others. The younger men asked to be given his pension payment. No cash was handed over and the two men fled the scene, abandoning the man’s body after a woman who had become suspicious raised the alarm with a staff member. The deceased man is reported to have been well known to the men who had been carrying his body. Gardaí said they were investigating “all the circumstances surrounding the unexplained death of an elderly male in the Carlow area”. A postmortem will be conducted. A woman living beside the post office said her daughter saw the two men carrying the deceased man into the building. “She was leaving my house at the time and said the man looked unwell as his feet were dragging the ground,” the woman, who did not want to be named, told the Irish Independent. The mayor of Carlow, Fianna Fáil councillor Ken Murnane, said he was “absolutely shocked” to hear the news. “I heard there was a commotion in the post office,” he told the newspaper. “I go by there all the time and it’s a very busy post office – normally there’d be a queue out the door there. “I was absolutely shocked to hear about what happened. I cannot believe anyone would do something like that. It beggars belief, I’m just shocked.” The local Fine Gael councillor Fergal Byrne echoed Murnane’s words, saying: “The whole town is in shock.” He described the deceased as “a nice man by all accounts and someone who caused no offence to anyone”. Byrne said: “The staff in the shop are very shook up from it. I’d like to offer my sympathies to the man’s family also. It’s a bizarre and upsetting situation.”",News/World news,Two men take corpse into Irish post office to claim dead man’s pension,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/two-men-take-corpse-into-irish-post-office-to-claim-dead-mans-pension
1/23/2022,"If you like delays then this match had them all. First there was a serious clash of heads that caused two Brentford players to be substituted with suspected concussions, before play was stopped again during the first half for more than 15 minutes after officials spotted an “unofficial drone” circling overhead. One day after Watford’s game with Norwich was delayed by floodlight problems, a police helicopter patrolled the skies during the second half to ensure the drone did not return as Rúben Neves sealed a fourth victory in five league games for a rapidly improving Wolves.  There were certainly no such incidents the last time Brentford hosted Wolves in the top flight more than 70 years ago, with that campaign ending in relegation for the home side despite a 4-1 victory in 1947 at Griffin Park after a 2-1 win at Molineux. Sitting comfortably in mid-table and seemingly within reach of safety in their first experience of the Premier League, Brentford must have seen this as a great opportunity to take another giant step towards their ultimate goal, but they have now suffered four straight defeats. The fact their opponents were without Raúl Jimenez after the Mexico striker picked up a suspected calf injury in training will only have increased the sense of what might have been. Wolves, who brought on the potentially Tottenham-bound Adama Traoré for the last 15 minutes as they pushed for victory, have emerged as surprise contenders for the top six in recent weeks thanks to some impressive performances. They came into the game having conceded one goal in five matches since losing to Manchester City last month. But they were immediately forced on the back foot by the twisting runs of Bryan Mbeumo, with the France forward often dropping deep to find space. The wind was somewhat taken out of Brentford’s sails after 20 minutes, however, when a nasty clash of heads between Rico Henry and Mathias Jensen led to a long delay. They were substituted after receiving treatment. Their replacements had been on the pitch for less than three minutes when play was stopped again, although this time it was due to the drone loitering overhead. The stadium announcer confirmed the players would have to leave the pitch due to Premier League rules – “don’t blame us, blame the drone” – and it was more than a quarter of an hour before they re-emerged. So much time had passed that it was necessary for the officials to announce there would be 19 minutes of injury time. Aside from a couple of half-chances for Wolves there was not much else to raise the temperature on a afternoon until, 71 minutes after it had kicked off, the first half came to an end. It seemed like a bad joke when play was once more delayed at the start of the second half while the referee, Peter Bankes, adjusted his equipment in the tunnel, with the managers at least able to see the funny side as they waited patiently on the touchline. Play finally resumed at just after 4.30pm and it did not take long for Wolves to find the breakthrough via a masterful strike from João Moutinho. The Portugal midfielder played a one-two with Nélson Semedo before curling home with the outside of his boot from inside the area. It needed more last-ditch defending to prevent Wolves from extending their lead when Fábio Silva linked well with Leander Dendoncker before just failing to latch on to the return pass. The hosts thought they could have had a penalty when Ivan Toney was clattered by José Sa, with replays suggesting Silva may have nudged the forward as he was jumping. Both sets of fans had reason to feel aggrieved when Bankes initially showed a red card to Toti Gomes for his foul on Vitaly Janelt before being asked to consult VAR and overturning his decision. The home supporters’ disappointment turned to glee when Toney slammed home Mbeumo’s free-kick on the volley to equalise. Their joy was shortlived, however, as Wolves kept the ball alive after another attack by the impressive Semedo and Neves was given too much time to pick his spot and seal another crucial victory. Thomas Frank, the Brentford manager, was shown a red card after the final whistle after making his dissatisfaction known to the officials.",Sport/Football,Wolves flying high as Rúben Neves seals win at Brentford after long drone delay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/22/brentford-wolves-premier-league-match-report
1/23/2022,"A Virginia mother was charged with making a threat on school property after she told local board members she would bring “every single gun loaded” if the district instituted a mask mandate. Renewed mask fights were touched off this month after the new Republican governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin, issued an executive order making masks optional for students, subject to the preference of parents.  In Luray, a small town in the Shenandoah Valley, the governor’s move prompted a special board meeting on Covid-19 mitigation strategies. At the Thursday meeting, Amelia Ruffner King, 42, told school board members: “No mask mandates – my child, my children will not come to school on Monday with masks on. That’s not happening.” She continued: “And I will bring every single gun loaded and ready to – I will,” before she was cut off. “That’s three minutes,” a school official said. Initially, police said they had increased security at schools but not made any arrests. Ruffner King’s statement “absolutely caused public alarm”, police said, adding that she “contacted law enforcement to apologize”. “We have been in contact with the parent who made the statement, she is cooperating with law enforcement,” police said. “This incident is still under investigation.” Police later charged Ruffner King and released her, on a $5,000 bond. After the meeting, school superintendent Antonio Fox said in a letter: “Page county public schools does not take these kinds of statements lightly.” Later that evening, board members voted to move from required universal masking to optional masking. The decision was made in spite of warnings from the superintendent that without masks, more students may be forced to quarantine if a student is found to be infected.",News/US news,Virginia woman charged for threats to ‘bring every gun’ over school mask rule,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/22/virginia-mother-charged-school-mask-rule
1/23/2022,"“We met when we were five. I don’t know how I would have managed without her.” As children, Barbara Kastelein, from Ashford in Kent, and her best friend, nicknamed “Tulip”, both had alcoholic fathers. Their friendship was an escape from unhappy homes. The best friends are now both 55 and their relationship is as solid as ever. Barbara says they are more like sisters – and still there for each other during tough times. When Barbara’s father died, Tulip drove for hours to be at the funeral and to help Barbara empty her father’s flat. “I can’t imagine life without her,” says Barbara. “She is my guardian angel.”  But not all best friendships last. Minreet Kaur, 41, from Hayes, met her best friend when she landed her first job after university. “I trusted her instantly, and she did me. We could talk about anything and always had each other’s back. She even supported me through my divorce. I couldn’t see life without her.” As time went by, Minreet immersed herself in her career while her best friend settled down and had a family. “We found we were leading different lives,” she says. “We don’t keep in touch. I’ve never had such a close friendship since. I miss her. Everyone needs a best friend.” Some of us have a single best friendship that spans our lifetime. We call them on a whim, we trust them completely, they are there for us, and us for them, without question. They are more like family. But, for adults, making friends can be hard. Scientists say it can take more than 200 hours to become close enough to someone to share a real emotional connection. But what if we don’t have a best friend? If we flit in and out of friendships or have no close friends at all – should we be worried? We gravitate towards people who are similar to ourselves. Homophily is the concept that similarity makes social connection easier. Now, research has shown that close friends resemble each other not just in manner and appearance, but physiologically too. Scientists at the University of California scanned the brains of a group of students as they watched a series of short videos and found that those who were close showed incredibly similar neural responses. The areas of the brain that responded similarly included those associated with motivation, learning, processing, memory, empathy, and generally making sense of things. The findings suggest we choose friends who interpret and react to the world in a similar way to ourselves. Dr Anna Machin, author of Why We Love: The New Science Behind Our Closest Relationships, is an evolutionary anthropologist who specialises in dyadic relationships – the closeness between two people – whether that’s a parent and child, lovers or best friends. “When we’re with someone we love, we experience a thing called biobehavioral synchrony,” she says. She describes how, when two people are tightly bonded, they mirror each other’s behaviour. They use the same gestures. They pick up the same tone of voice or use the same phraseology. Best friends’ physiology comes into synchrony too – the rhythm of their hearts, body temperature and hormonal responses. Look inside the brain and you’d see synchrony, says Machin, in the gamma waves – the higher cognitive functioning parts of the brain. So, are we hardwired to seek out a best-friend relationship? Robin Dunbar, emeritus professor of evolutionary psychology at Oxford University, studies the connection between behaviour, cognition and neuroendocrinology – the brain’s regulation of hormonal activity in the body. The maximum number of friendships humans are able to maintain, says Dunbar, is 150. “Dunbar’s number” harks back to the size of prehistoric hunter-gatherer communities but is also true of modern society. However, it’s not always plain sailing when you live in a large group. “Group living can be a major problem for mammals, especially primates. The bigger the group, the more stresses you suffer.” Dunbar describes what he calls the “London commuter problem”, the pressure of living in cramped conditions with other people. It is your closest friends, he says, that make social living possible by keeping others at bay. “Friendships vary in quality and make up a series of layers, or circles. You have an inner core of five and, within that, a layer of 1.5. These are your most intimate friends or your romantic partner. Your inner circle – and within that your best friend for ever – provides a hugely important buffer against the stresses of living in social groups.” The reason the number of people in your innermost circle of friends is 1.5, explains Dunbar, is that for men it tends to be their romantic partner, whereas for women it’s their romantic partner plus a close (usually) female friend. Dunbar describes the physical benefits of friendship – the calming effect you feel as endorphins are released on social interaction with your “bestie”, as well as the positive effects such close bonds have on the immune system. “A connection of this kind is the best antidepressant you can get,” says Dunbar. Close relationships have been shown to result in lifelong physical and mental health benefits. Research shows people with good social bonds are happier, live longer and have better reproductive health. They are less likely to suffer illness and recover more quickly. They can cope better with stress, and there is less risk of developing addictions or psychopathology. A meta-study of 149 studies found that bonds with close friends could even be more important to your health than losing weight or exercising. In fact, according to a US survey of 20,000 people, not having close relationships can be as bad for your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. “At the basic level, friends are a mechanism for survival,” says Machin, “but what’s really interesting about friendship, particularly female friendship, is how we often underestimate the importance of that friendship in our lives. We usually put romantic relationships at the top, then maybe your mum and dad, then friends are down here somewhere,” Machin gestures towards the floor, “but actually, for many women, the critical relationship in life is their best friend.” Women, she says, are often more emotionally intimate with their best female friend than they are with their romantic partner. They share their deepest, darkest emotional fears and allow themselves to be more vulnerable in front of their best friend than when they are with their partner. “Women get a really important input from their female friends in terms of their mental wellbeing. If we look at a man’s brain when he’s having deep and meaningful conversation with his closest friend, we see his amygdala – the brain’s fear and risk sensor – fire up, so he’s finding it quite uncomfortable. “In a woman’s brain, a similar conversation with a best friend results in reward chemicals, an increase in oxytocin, a real sense of relaxation – it’s all amazing, it’s a really brilliant experience.” So if we don’t have a best friend, are we broken? “Absolutely not!” says Dr Miriam Kirmayer, a clinical psychologist who specialises in friendship. “Each of our relationships help us meet our need to feel that sense of connection and belonging. This is true of our closest friendships, our acquaintanceships – even our moments of connection with strangers.” Kirmayer says it’s not the label that’s important but that our friendships are reciprocal. Research suggests that up to half of our friendships are actually unreciprocated. “When we feel chosen, that is, that the people we choose are choosing us in return, this is paramount. Healthy close friendships are based on balance and reciprocity.” According to the brain opioid theory of social attachment, social interactions trigger positive emotions when endorphins bind to opioid receptors in the brain. This gives us that feelgood factor that we get from seeing our friends. “Lots of people I’ve interviewed say they felt an absolute high after spending time with a best friend, which carried them through the whole of the next day,” says Machin. Thinking about the neurochemistry explains how during lockdown many people were, in effect, suffering from withdrawal. Technology has made it easier to connect with friends – and it has become the norm to publicise our friendships. There are currently almost 69m Instagram posts tagged #bestfriends and the hashtag #IBF (internet best friend) recently clocked more than 25m views on TikTok. But how does this modern manifestation of best-friendship interact with life offline? Social media interactions have been shown to increase closeness between friends who also interact offline, yet social media use has been shown to displace time spent on face-to-face interactions. “You can maintain real friendships online. Social media simply provides a medium of communication,” says Dunbar. “However, [communicating online] is not as gratifying as face-to-face. It only slows the rate of decay of relationships. It won’t stop them decaying eventually.” Machin adds: “It is much harder to maintain relationships online because of the reduction – if not complete lack – of neurochemical release. And there is certainly no biobehavioral synchrony.” When it comes to the complexity of social bonding, nothing compares to human friendship – and your best friend is the most important of all. “Friendship infiltrates every aspect of our lives, every aspect of our physiology,” says Machin. “It’s astonishing how complicated it is.” At its most basic level, says Machin, friendship is biological bribery. It’s a set of neurochemicals that motivate and reward you for forming and maintaining relationships. It’s a mechanism that has evolved to make sure that you invest in the relationships that are critical to your survival and the survival of the species. It’s through biobehavioral synchrony that we feel that profound connection. We see this in romantic relationships, we see it in relationships between parents and children, and we see it in best friends. While we often look for desirable practical qualities in a romantic partner – would they be a good parent to my children? Do we share similar goals in life? – our priorities for a best friend differ. “In best friendships, we know that the parties are more relaxed, more open with each other,” says Machin, “because they are not always having to remain attractive for their partner.” A best friendship is all about shared humour, values and support. You can live on opposite sides of the Earth and still feel that closeness with your one special friend. “It’s as if every sinew in your body is engaged in having a relationship with that person,” says Machin. “That for me sums up how important best friends are. Evolution has seen fit to engage every mechanism in your body – the behavioural, the physiological, the neurological – to make sure that you’re as tightly bonded to this person as you possibly can be. We wouldn’t have evolved this way if those relationships weren’t critical for survival.”",News/Science,Darling buds: how best friends keep us healthy and happy,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/22/darling-buds-how-best-friends-keep-us-healthy-and-happy
