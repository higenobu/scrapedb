3/21/2022,"Today’s puzzles require you to roll up your sleeves and wrestle with a square piece of paper. Because this is the best way to become brilliant at a maths. Or so concludes a recent study by developmental psychologists at Surrey, Toronto and Maryland universities. The report – a meta-analysis that combined the results of 29 separate studies involving almost 4,000 children – says that activities that train spatial reasoning like paper folding, building with blocks, and solving three-dimensional puzzles are by far the most effective way for young people to raise their maths performance. “When children learn the relationship between space and shapes through tangible physical tools such as puzzles, their mathematics performance improves,” says Dr Katie Gilligan-Lee of the University of Surrey, a co-author of the report. “We found that spatial training with physical 3D materials led to bigger gains than computer-based training or workbook activities. So physically holding, rotating, turning and combining objects with your hands is much more effective than using a mouse to do spatial computer games.” In fact, spatial reasoning training is more effective than maths mastery classes, summer school, chess clubs, getting older kids to help younger ones, and other parental and school interventions. Yet fiddling about with physical puzzles is a neglected part of educational practice and policy. Dr Gilligan-Lee thinks that increasing spatial training in the classroom could dramatically improve mathematics outcomes in the UK, which lags behind its international competitors at STEM skills. “This is particularly true given that people find spatial activities and puzzles to be engaging, fun, and importantly they are perceived to be non-academic.” Now to today’s tasks. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did. There is something incredibly satisfying about connecting directly with an object, unmediated by writing on paper or thinking in abstractions. Note: For all the puzzles you require a square sheet of paper. For the final puzzles you may require a hole punch or sharp object. 1. The triangle fold Fold a square paper in such a way that fold lines (and possibly an edge) mark an equilateral triangle. (Compass and ruler not allowed!) 2. The 3D shape Can you fold a square sheet of paper so that it makes a closed 3D shape, with no overlaps, gaps or extraneous flaps of paper? You cannot, for example, fold the square to make a cube since you will create an overlap or extra flaps. Hole punch puzzles For each of the next puzzles, you must take a square piece of paper and fold it, using as many folds as is needed, so that if you punch a single hole through the folded paper you will match the image when the paper is fully unfolded. 3. The X 4. The diagonal 3. The ring 4. A hole punch in the head I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the solutions. Please discuss your favourite physical puzzles below the line. Puzzle 1 is taken from The Paper Puzzle Book, puzzle 2 is taken from the Two-Minute Puzzle Book, both excellent and published by World Scientific.

3/21/2022,"Women would be as much as $118,000 better off in retirement if subsidies were increased to make childcare more affordable, according to new research by Industry Super Australia (ISA). ISA said the move would help close the gap between men and women, who retire with an average of a third less super than men because of time spent out of the workforce with children, and boost Australia’s total superannuation savings by $35bn by 2050. Until recently, the government subsidised up to 85% of childcare costs for lower income households, but the payment declines at the steep rate of one percentage point for every $3,000 a family earns over $70,000 a year. According to research by the Grattan Institute, this dramatic fall in the subsidy discourages women with small children from working more than three days a week. For ISA’s new report, accounting firm Deloitte modelled the effect of boosting the childcare subsidy from 85% to 95% for low-income households and flattening the taper rate at which it is reduced as income rises. Deloitte’s modelling found that a woman earning the median wage would have $118,000 more in super by retirement if the changes allowed her to work five days a week rather than two. A woman in the same situation who was part of a low-income couple would be $69,000 better off. The change would also reduce dependence on pensions and increase the income tax take by $2.1bn a year by 2050, according to the report. “Making childcare more affordable will boost retirement savings, slash the gender super gap and drive down future pension costs,” said ISA’s director of advocacy, Georgia Brumby. “More affordable childcare combined with paying super on parental leave will make sure mums are not left behind when they have children,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report is the second in a series by ISA tackling the retirement income gap. Last year it recommended paying super on parental leave. ISA said there was still much work to be done, with many other factors contributing to women leaving the workforce with less in super than men. These include lower participation in the workforce by women than men, lower pay in female-dominated industries, the gender pay gap, employers that won’t give flexibility to accommodate caring responsibility, discrimination in hiring and pay rise decisions and women being expected to do unpaid caring work. Additional drivers will be examined in future reports, ISA said.",News/Australia news,"More affordable childcare would boost women’s retirement savings, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/more-affordable-childcare-would-boost-womens-retirement-savings-report-says
3/21/2022,"Universities must stop accepting funding from fossil fuel companies to conduct climate research, even if the research is aimed at developing green and low-carbon technology, an influential group of distinguished academics has said. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, the Nasa data scientist Peter Kalmus, and prominent US climate scientist Michael Mann are among close to 500 academics from the US and the UK who have written an open letter addressed to all university leaders in the two countries, calling on them to reject all funding from fossil fuel companies. Accepting money from fossil fuel companies represented “an inherent conflict of interest” and could “taint” essential research and “compromise” academic freedom, they wrote. For the companies, it was a chance to “greenwash” their reputations and skew the findings of research in a way favourable to them. The letter draws a comparison to the tobacco industry and its disinformation campaigns, noting that numerous public heath and research institutions reject tobacco funding for these reasons and calling on fossil fuel cash to be treated similarly. “Universities and the research they produce are vital to delivering a rapid, just transition away from fossil fuels. However, such efforts are undermined by fossil fuel industry funding. Academics should not be forced to choose between researching climate solutions and inadvertently aiding corporate greenwashing,” the signatories wrote. Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, told the Guardian: “This sort of funding has been used to compromise leading academic institutions. It’s a two-for for polluters: they purchase the imprimatur of these institutions and their presumed authority and objectivity, while funding research that often translates into advocacy for false solutions and ‘kick the can down the road’ prescriptions like massive carbon capture, which is unproven at scale, and geoengineering, which is downright dangerous. That is entirely the wrong path forward.” Genevieve Guenther, founder and director of the End Climate Silence campaign, and an affiliate at the New School university in New York, said: “Funding research enables oil and gas companies to ground their promotional statements in enough truth to give substance to the green shadows in which they hide their most polluting and deadly activities. We must remove fossil-energy interests from our institutions so that our children can have a chance at a liveable future.” Universities have been under pressure from their students and some academics for several years to divest their investments, such as pension funds and endowments, away from fossil fuels, and many have done so. However, this is the first major call from senior academics for them to go further and cut all research ties with fossil fuel companies. There is no clear estimate for how much money universities accept from fossil fuel companies, as most do not publish their sources. An investigation for the Observer last year found UK universities alone had taken at least £89m from oil companies in the previous four years. Some scientists disagree with the letter. James Hansen, former chief scientist at Nasa and one of the first scientists to warn governments of the impending climate crisis, told the Guardian: “It’s the wrong focus, causing young people to waste their energy on unproductive activities, while they actually have the potential to lead a solution.” Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, said it was reasonable for universities to accept funding from fossil fuel companies if those businesses showed genuine commitment to transforming themselves. “Fossil fuel companies that are genuinely committed to the transition [to a low-carbon economy], including net zero emissions, can and should receive help from university researchers, particularly with the development of technologies for carbon capture and storage, renewables and emissions reductions. However, universities should be careful about accepting funding directly or indirectly from oil, gas and coal companies that are not genuinely committed to the clean energy transition and which are attempting to greenwash their reputations.” A spokesperson for Imperial College London, which the Observer found last year had accepted £54m from oil companies since 2017, said: “Decarbonisation is our top priority when working with energy companies. This goal requires a radical shift in industrial systems, technologies and business models in the energy sector. We are using our influence and expertise to accelerate this transition and actively engage with energy companies to push them to meet the Paris Agreement targets. We will monitor progress and only continue to work with companies who demonstrate commitment and credible action to achieving these targets.” Some academics argue that fossil fuel funding is needed to develop the technologies necessary for a low-carbon economy, and that if western universities reject such funding it will be accepted in other countries around the world. Guenther disagreed: “It’s a myth that fossil-energy companies are spending large sums to aid the green transition. According to the IEA’s 2021 World Energy Investment report, a mere 1% of fossil-energy companies’ capital expenditure is devoted to research, development or deployment of technologies that either abate or do not produce greenhouse gas emissions.” At the end of this month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will publish the third part of its comprehensive review of climate science, examining the potential ways of cutting greenhouse gas emissions. This will include technology such as renewable energy and nuclear power, and novel ideas such as sucking carbon dioxide out of the air. The report will throw the spotlight on the potential technological solutions to the climate crisis, which will require tens or hundreds of billions of pounds in funding to be brought to market and deployed widely around the world. Jason Hickel, an economic anthropologist who is signatory to the letter, said the funding should come from governments. “The US and UK are among the richest countries on Earth, and their governments enjoy total monetary sovereignty. They have the capacity to finance the necessary research many times over, at the touch of a button. Most of the major innovations and public projects that have changed history over the past century have relied on public funding for research,” said Hickel, who is professor of environmental science at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and a fellow of the LSE. The letter did not specify whether companies with interests in fossil fuels amid a broader portfolio should be included in the ban. Ilana Cohen, a Harvard student who led the organisation of the letter, said it was directed at the top 200 fossil fuel companies. Cohen said the organisers had confined the call to US and UK universities for now as these are where many fossil fuel companies are concentrating their funding, but that it could be widened in future to a global effort.",News/Science,"Universities must reject fossil fuel cash for climate research, say academics",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/21/universities-must-reject-fossil-fuel-cash-for-climate-research-say-academics
3/21/2022,"Kiri Pritchard-McLean made her name with consciousness-raising comedy drawing on her own experiences – of sexism in the comedy industry, of volunteering with disadvantaged kids. Her latest, Home Truths, is a less campaigning affair, about her relationship with, and return to, her native Wales. There’s some terrific stuff here, but I did miss the purposefulness of those previous offerings, that potent mix of personal insight and political edge. A pivot to social commentary – Pritchard-McLean latterly addresses anti-racism and transgender rights – doesn’t quite fill the gap. The show is at its best when its chronicle of our host’s life in north Wales dovetails with an account of that country’s vexed cultural politics. On the one hand, we learn about Pritchard-McLean’s contested claim on Welshness, because she didn’t grow up speaking the language. On the other, she tells us about “the Welsh knot”, by which generations of children were beaten out of their linguistic patrimony – and (there’s a funny punchline to this one) the relative seniority of the Welsh flag and poo emojis. She’s interesting, too, on the symmetries between the forces that first repelled her from, then attracted her back to, Anglesey. Before we get there, there’s backstory, about the 35-year-old’s childhood, bullied – for opposite reasons – at her private primary and state secondary schools. There is also, in a show that’s 20 minutes too long, extraneous material about her experiences in sex-ed and home economics class, and a few routines too many about how fat she supposedly is. The last of these is co-opted to make the point, at the end of a section on racism and “the trans debate” (a phrase she hates), about how hard it is to look at ourselves in the mirror – but how necessary, in a country with a skewed sense of its own moral probity. This routine, lacking the flavour of lived experience that characterised her earlier campaigning comedy, can feel sermonising, and its arguments tendentious. I left respecting Pritchard-McLean’s call-to-arms on behalf of Britain’s abused minorities – among whose number her own people recently counted – while regretting how crudely it’s grafted on to the comedy.

3/21/2022,"To say this unmissable, deeply depressing book – about exactly how Britain pimps itself to the world’s dirtiest money – is timely is to miss author Oliver Bullough’s point. The fact is the stories that he tells, sordid tales of a nation flogging its real estate and its services and its football clubs and its good name to the shadiest and highest bidder, no questions asked, have been hiding in plain sight for decades. It has just seemed in no government’s interest to notice them. Bullough himself has long been shouting from the bullet-proof penthouses about these tales. Alongside his 2018 book Moneyland – a quest into that Narnia of libel laws and tax havens and old-school-tie discretion that makes London so attractive to extortionists – he organised “kleptocrat tours” of the capital, his equivalent of Hollywood Hills rubber-necking, bus trips around Knightsbridge and Mayfair pointing out the mansions where the cronies of the world’s worst dictators and biggest tax dodgers hide their billions. It took even Bullough a while, though, to nail the exact bent-double relationship that many among the elite of this country’s lawmakers and bankers and lawyers and accountants have adopted toward this global kleptocracy. The rouble dropped when he was approached by an American academic and asked to explain what the British government did to protect the nation against money laundering. Which agencies had the most teeth, which prosecutors won the most cases, which politicians were most vocal, where could he find the paper trails? Bullough had to explain that unlike in the United States, where there were well-funded federal bureaux and tenacious homeland security investigators and high-profile cases of launderers brought to justice, in Britain there were very few of these things. Eventually, in response to his interlocutor’s bafflement, he blurted: “We’re not a policeman, like you guys, we’re a butler, the butler to the world… If someone is rich, whether they are Chinese or Russian or whatever, and they need something done, or something hidden, or something bought, then Britain sorts that out for them… – that’s what a butler does.” The American asked him another question: “How long has this been going on?” and Bullough again found himself answering without hesitation: “It started in the 1950s. We needed a new business model after America took over as the world’s superpower, and this is what we found.” He dates the shift to the Suez crisis in 1956, the year that Britain’s imperial apparatus finally collapsed, and the establishment cast around for another source of wealth to keep it in the style to which it had long become accustomed. The philosophy of the new venture went by the name of “light touch regulation”. The unmatched financial and legal infrastructure that had allowed the UK to conquer a quarter of the world was quietly repurposed to do the bidding of individuals from dubious regimes that it had sometimes fostered, and others who had seized control of their nation’s resources and needed a place to hide what they creamed off. Bullough begins by showing how old colonialists found a new niche in recreating the further-flung outposts of empire – the self-governing protectorates of the British Virgin Islands, the Caymans, Gibraltar – as looters’ havens. They used crafty expertise to create the small print of shell companies and financial instruments that allowed multimillionaires and global corporations to avoid doing the thing they liked least – pay taxes. Successive UK governments, while occasionally handwringing about closing those loopholes, were, he shows, complicit in this practice, working on that time-honoured imperial principle: well, if we don’t do it, someone else will. Over time our biggest growth industry, the new source of the City’s wealth and power, was as 10% fixers for fraudsters and worse. “In Britain,” Bullough argues, “butlering is almost invariably regarded as a source of jobs and wealth because it is seen from the butler’s perspective rather than that of their clients’ or their victims’… It makes a good comedy when Jeeves outsmarts the village bobby or Bertie Wooster gets away with a scam because his chum is the local magistrate, but this is not the way to run a financial system.” Inevitably, several of the minutely researched case studies he analyses involve Russia and Ukraine. One of the most bleakly instructive is the Ministry of Defence’s decision, in 2014, to sell for £53m the former London Underground station at Brompton Road near Harrods to a man named Dmitry Firtash, whom the US government had been seeking to extradite on racketeering charges. Firtash had made his billions as a middleman between the Kremlin and the Russian oil giant Gazprom, and has consistently been forced to deny association with the FBI’s most-wanted Ukrainian-born mobster Semyon Mogilevich. In Britain, however, with the cross-bench assistance of MPs he had set up the British Ukrainian Society in 2007 and given £6m to Cambridge University to fund a course in Ukrainian studies. After the invasion of Crimea he was invited in to advise the Foreign Office. “I tried to persuade them that imposing sanctions against Russia was a bad idea,” he told a Russian news agency. In this context, and in the context of many other stories that Bullough tells, Boris Johnson’s determination to delay the report of the intelligence and security committee into compromising Russian activity in the UK, and then dismiss it as the work of “Islington Remainers”, looks ever more alarming. The report highlighted, Bullough quotes, how “the inherent tension between the government’s prosperity agenda and the need to protect national security has been played out across Whitehall departments…” We are, partly as a result of Bullough’s digging, likely to hear a good deal more about that “prosperity agenda” in the coming months and years.

3/21/2022,"Kenneth Branagh has ventured bravely into contested territory with this deeply personal film, set at the outbreak of the Troubles in the city of his birth. So divisions are inevitable, with those who deplore it as a travesty of political reality ranged against others who recognise their own stories in it, or simply like it for what it is: a portrait of an ordinary childhood upended by extraordinary communal violence. There’s no pretence here to offer a political overview. Part of the film’s strength is the way it holds the focus at the level of a small boy’s understanding, so the betrayals seem inexplicable, the threat only ever half seen. As long as nine-year-old Buddy (played by Jude Hill) can go to the cinema with his granny to see thrilling new technicolour releases – which cast a romantic glow over his imagination that resists the sombre palette of the film itself – everything is more or less right in his world. This is how childhood is; it’s how children have always been able to survive the most terrible circumstances. If Jamie Dornan and Caitríona Balfe seem implausibly glamorous, it’s because that’s how Buddy sees them; if Ciarán Hinds’s roguish Pop seems impossibly erudite, it’s because anyone who can do maths homework seems like a genius to a small child who can’t. Branagh knew he was opening himself up to charges of sentimentality, and reviewers have duly obliged, but it’s a lazy position. The film is not about blue remembered hills but grey remembered streets: in its palette, its pacing and the rigour of its perspective, it earns the emotion it calls from us. It might big up the quaint values of working-class family and community, unfashionably pitting old-fashioned neighbourhood policing against the growing lawlessness of the street in one comic scene of Buddy getting his comeuppance. But there’s a bigger reality, written across the clenched, scored face of Judi Dench’s Granny, or overheard through the parentheses of doors and windows in snippets of adult conversation (“The police won’t protect us. We have to do it ourselves”). In 98 tightly edited minutes (beautifully shot by Haris Zambarloukos) it reveals a depressed, monochrome city, where the women struggle to put chips on the table, and the men are forced overseas to find work; where a spittle-flecked preacher showers vitriol on the heads of his congregation; where neighbours who look out for a small boy are quick to crab about his mother, and there’s no future for friendship between children from different faiths. Above all it’s a film about migration: about all that is lost when political circumstances make home impossible. “When we migrate, we murder from our lives those we leave behind,” wrote the Pakistani novelist Mohsin Hamid, of another continent in another era. Buddy and his parents leave Pop in the cemetery and Granny standing alone in the street muttering, “Go, and don’t look back.” It’s sad, for sure, but through the strength of its performances, its eye for the pratfalls of childhood, its grasp of the tragic absurdity of communal strife, it avoids being simply sentimental. At this new moment of loss and mass displacement, Belfast deserves to be taken very seriously indeed.",Arts/Film,Why Belfast should win the best picture Oscar,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/21/why-belfast-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar
3/21/2022,"Only a vibrant, rebellious town like Marseille could do it: stand up to bourgeois Lyon, Bordeaux and even Paris, the established gourmet destinations, and imagine a new and different French menu, one that fits our time and forges a path forward. This southern port city is a lot cheaper and sunnier than Paris, but until recently had no fine dining scene – all the good food was eaten at home or in a pizzeria. But over the past five to 10 years, lots of young cooks with diverse food heritages have moved to Marseille to open restaurants and create something new. Local, traditional chefs reacted to the “invasion” and gentrification by reaffirming their approach, with a newfound quality and creativity. Combine the energy of the new chefs with the passion and knowledge of the more traditional ones, and suddenly there is much better food all across town. In Marseille, most of us are migrants, and here, more than anywhere else in France, food is memory, power, and freedom of speech – an easy way to create connections between us all. Now, Michelin is finally showering stars across the city, on Alexandre Mazzia (born in Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Coline Faulquier (from Burgundy) at Restaurant Signature. And rightly so. But most of the city’s gems remain off the guides’ radars, and are inexpensive. Affordable, creative and inclusive, with influences from all corners of the world and many thriving female chefs – that is Marseille’s incredible food scene, and the culinary future of France. I spent the past two years eating my way across my home town to meet the pioneers of this delicious revolution, and wrote a book about it: Marseille Cuisine Le Monde. Here, I invite some of them to your table. Lilian grew up in a lakeside village near Zürich, came to Marseille in 2017 and chose to open her fish and vegetarian restaurant Limmat where no Marseillais would have dared: on the steep steps running from Cours Julien towards Noailles. “I like Marseille for its diversity, joyous atmosphere, laid-back people, rich culture and history, and I adore the sea, the sun, the sky, the light,” she says. “The food scene here is blooming! The cuisine is young, more and more political, committed to sustainability, and I really enjoy the fact that we are many female chefs.” One of her favourite spots is Brûlerie Möka, for “high-quality coffee de terroir with a conscience, a cosy atmosphere and a passionate team”. Marseille is where coffee first arrived in France, and here barista Iris Michalon has created an ethical and sustainable coffee place next to her roastery in the Boulevard Chave area. Lilian also likes La Fabriquerie in Saint-Victor, next to Les Catalans beach. “Two chefs and a sommelier prepare the best picnic to take away.” Hugues moved from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to a suburb of Paris at the age of nine, later attending a French culinary school and training in Michelin-star restaurants. His first restaurant in Marseille was in the Noailles district, AKA the “belly of Marseille”, which he moved to the glamorous Maison Montgrand hotel, though he is about to leave there. Hugues’s unique style is French mixed with his Congolese roots and inspired by his ongoing research into west African dishes and ingredients. Recently, Hugues and his wife, Mathilde, opened Libala, an African street-food canteen where gourmets stop for dishes such as sweet potato waffles with cumin, or pulled beef on brioche with coriander. “Marseille is like a village and we love that,” says Hugues. “It’s perfect for a young couple with a baby and lots of projects. The surrounding energy makes you think everything is possible.” They like to shop at Tam-Ky, a cult Asian-African grocery in the town centre run by 10 Vietnamese siblings with strong Marseille accents. The family arrived in France in 1979 and the children grew up in the earthy northern districts of Marseille. “It’s our favourite food shop,” says Hugues, “where we buy all the ingredients from my childhood. Try the niébé beans. We cook our falafels with them at Libala.” They also recommend Oh Faon!, “a new adventure in cake-land”. There, Jérôme Raffaelli and Kevin Yau wanted to create vegan pastries that everybody would crave, and they succeeded. “Try their sticky mango cake, made with coconut mousse, mochi, mango puree and coconut crumble.” “I love this agitated and colourful harbour because it’s a true Mediterranean city,” says Marie Dijon, one of Marseille’s homegrown, up-and-coming talents. After working in several trendy kitchens around town, she opened her own spot, Caterine, mid-pandemic with two girlfriends. It’s near the new foodie street, Boulevard Chave, where she grew up. To ensure that the fantastic food is affordable, they spend money only on ingredients and kitchen staff – there are no waiting staff. You order food at the counter, pick it up when it’s ready, eat, and then clean your table. But the mix of flavours in your mouth is insane. Marie’s values are shared by other female chefs in the city, such as Laëtitia Visse at meat-focused restaurant La Femme du Boucher, Noémie Lebocey at Les Eaux de Mars, Sarah Chougnet-Strudel at Regain and Charlotte Baldaquin at Les Grandes Tables de la Criee. They all adhere to sustainable practices, zero waste, and sourcing from local urban farms – which all have a social impact in Marseille. And they have no problem shaking up their grandmothers’ recipes. “Marseille’s culinary scene was really behind until new chefs with an identity as strong as the city chose to come here,” says Marie. Her top tip: “Sunday in Les Goudes [a seaside neighbourhood near the Calanques] is a must-do. Go early by bus, bike or boat, but don’t drive. Walk to Cap Croisette, “the end of the world”, swim, stare at the beautiful scenery and Maïre island, and then go eat fresh fish at L’Auberge du Corsaire Chez Paul, where tables are spread on the little old harbour. Book your table ahead, and be patient. For more fish options, try Le Grand Bar des Goudes, Restaurant Tabi on the city coast road, or Chez Madie – Les Galinettes at the Old Port. Marseille hosts a couscous festival, Kouss-Kouss, in late August each year, when dozens of restaurants create a special couscous for the occasion, whether their usual cuisine is north African or not. The best couscous in Marseille, though, is at Le Femina chez Kachetel. Founded by a family of Algerian berbers from the Kabylia region, it celebrated its 100-year anniversary last year. It’s right in the middle of Noailles, and Mustapha knows everything and everyone. His couscous stands out because it is made with barley, not wheat. Mustapha recommends Pastels World: “In Noailles we all talk a lot, including with the newcomers like L’Idéal and La Mercerie. When someone opens a restaurant, they come to eat here or I go to eat at theirs. These new restaurateurs have developed Noailles’ potential and are attracting a wider clientele to our streets. Among them are a very nice, hard-working young couple, Sonia and Raphaël, who cook Senegalese pastels – half-moon pastries filled with spiced fish or meat.” Lebanese chef Najla trained as a film director; her husband Serje Banna is a chatty Armenian-Lebanese former DJ who now does front of house. They moved here from Beirut seven years ago. “Marseille is like a mirror image of Beirut on the other side of the Med,” says Najla. “It has a piece of everybody’s home, and the word ‘tranquille’ [chill], used all day by the Marseillais, sums it up. It’s a city that haunts you, sticks to your skin and heart. You either love it or you hate it.” Najla’s cuisine at Mouné is a modern take on flamboyant Lebanese food culture, Ottolenghi style. Located between rue Sainte and rue Vauban, it’s perfect for a night out, with post-dinner drinks at nearby Bar Gaspard. The couple recommend La Poissonnerie du Golfe, the oldest fish shop in town, where they source all the fish for their restaurant. “It’s tiny, smaller than your living room, and owned by two female fishmongers, Laurence Ciccarelli and her niece, Justine. The fish and seafood are super-fresh, seasonal and tasty. Try their oysters and sea urchins, or things you’ve never eaten before.”",Lifestyle/Travel,Mouthwatering Marseille: a taste of France’s f revolution,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/mar/21/mouthwatering-marseille-france-culinary-revolution

Why else would you bite the heads off of bats and doves at record company meetings? So – interesting fellow. The song I secretly like but tell everyone I hateWhen Will I Be Famous? by Bros. You’d never admit to that publicly. All the girls fancied them at school, but that recent Bros documentary was like Spinal Tap mixed with The Office. The best song to have sex toRocket Man by Elton John. It says so many things about the sexual act itself. It’s quite short, though, so you might have to put it on repeat! The song I wish I’d writtenAll I Want for Christmas by Mariah Carey. I worked for Mariah Carey when I was doing my media degree. One of my mates from uni got me a job at Wembley and I ended up taking her bags to the car. Then years later, I sold out the same venue. The song I can’t help singingBohemian Rhapsody by Queen. It’s almost like a hymn anyway. Everyone knows the lyrics to O Come, All Ye Faithful and everyone knows the lyrics to Bohemian Rhapsody.

3/21/2022,"Mary Dickins had been a spectator at poetry nights before and knew “the poetry clap”. She mimes a polite tapping of fingers. But when she made her debut as a performer at the age of 62 at the legendary Bang Said the Gun night in south London, “it was so anarchic and wild – like nothing I had seen before”. The audience stamped feet, shook shakers. “It felt transformative. I thought: ‘I’ve got to have more of this.’” Even though Dickins says she “constantly has impostor syndrome – I always feel that I’m going to be found out”, becoming a performance poet has given her a place on a stage of her own making. All her life she has written, mostly without being seen or heard. Her mother died when she was nine, and, after she went into a care home at 13, Dickins’ writing “stayed in notebooks”. “Never really took it anywhere,” she says (she has a habit of eliding the personal pronoun, as if she might be an impostor in her own sentences). But really, she says, a lot of her adult life has been about getting over childhood shyness. At university in north London – she studied education – she met her husband of 40 years, but in three years of seminars she did not utter a word. Some of this is a legacy of her years at a children’s home in Kent, she says. “It gave me a sense of what it’s like to be othered.” And it exacerbated her sense that she “never fitted in anywhere. There was always something different about me.” Dickins left that home, The Hollies, at 16, went briefly to art school and then embarked on what she calls her “chequered career”. For 10 years she travelled, from the Isles of Scilly to Israel, working as she went. “Restaurants, chambermaid in hotels, pickle factory, biscuit factory … I was a kind of vagabond,” she says. In her mid-20s, she returned to England to start her degree. “I thought it was time to start being sensible,” she says. After she graduated, she discovered that she loved working with people with learning disabilities. She became an expert – or, as she puts it, a “so-called expert” – in inclusive education. “That was my niche,” she says. She published books, and returned to the University of North London as a senior lecturer in early childhood studies. Even when her two children were young, she kept writing. “You can be cleaning the toilet and writing in your head,” she says. She joined local writing groups, and attended an Arvon course on comedy and poetry. Since her debut at Bang Said the Gun, Dickins, 72, has been a finalist in the Poetry Rivals National Slam, published a volume of verse, Happiness FM, and guested at the Poetry Takeaway van. Although she came back to England to be sensible, Dickins now sees that in adulthood she has been “giving myself permission to be silly. The sillier I allow myself to be, the better the writing is.” Her observations are humorous and poignant. “Words can be very soothing,” she says. “Putting things into words and giving your emotions shape is an important part of coming to terms with the things that happen in life.” Recently Dickins has acquired a different perspective on her heritage. Her parents moved to London from India in 1948, and she thinks her sense of injustice was already there in the family house: “There was a lot of mixed heritage that was not acknowledged.” When she was five, she discovered a portrait hidden in a wardrobe, but her mother took it away. Only when a cousin circulated photographs 15 years ago did Dickins realise that the dark-skinned man she had taken for a servant was her grandfather, “a tremendous man”, chess grandmaster, army captain and surgeon who ran free clinics. “I thought: ‘I know who I am now. I get so much from this guy that I’ve not been allowed to know about.” Does she still feel like an outsider? “I think I’ve made it into a virtue. I celebrate the fact that I don’t fit into a box. Finally! Have to wait till you’re 72 to feel confident!” she says. “But I have a sense of who I am and I’m proud of it. I wouldn’t be anyone else now – and it took me a long time to say that.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,A new start after 60: ‘I became a performance poet at 62 – and finally I have a sense of who I am’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/21/a-new-start-after-60-i-became-a-performance-poet-at-62-and-finally-i-have-a-sense-of-who-i-am
3/21/2022,"Apple’s cut-price iPhone is back and has been upgraded for 2022, with a faster chip and 5G making it an even better bargain than before. The third-generation iPhone SE costs £419 ($429/A$719) and is the cheapest smartphone Apple sells, priced to compete with myriad mid-range Android devices. On the face of it, the iPhone SE doesn’t look that tempting a proposition. There are cheaper smartphones available and it only comes with 64GB of storage. The 4.7in LCD display is bright, but cramped and markedly less crisp and vibrant than competitors. It is basically the same as the previous version from 2020 on the outside, which already looked extremely dated. But while the phone may look decidedly old school on the outside, internally it is anything but. It has Apple’s latest A15 chip, which is the fastest on the block and the same one in the top of the line iPhone 13 Pro. The phone is extremely responsive in use and will continue to be so for years. It runs the latest version of iOS and all the apps and games you might want, except Fortnite. It has 5G, wifi 6, Bluetooth 5, wireless charging, water resistance and all the things you’d expect of a modern phone in 2022. Battery life is average for a modern smartphone, lasting in the region of 30 hours between charges with the screen on for about four hours using various messaging services and apps, and two hours of 5G. That’s a couple of hours longer than its predecessor but miles behind the 46-hour iPhone 13. Use more 4G or 5G mobile data than wifi and battery life will be shorter but the iPhone SE should generally last about a day of use as long as you’re not gaming for long sessions. Screen: 4.7in Retina HD (LCD) (326ppi) Processor: Apple A15 Bionic RAM: 4GB Storage: 64, 128 or 256GB Operating system: iOS 15.4 Camera: 12MP rear camera with OIS, 7MP front-facing camera Connectivity: 5G, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5, Lightning, and GPS Water resistance: IP67 (1m up to 30 minutes) Dimensions: 138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3mm Weight: 144g The iPhone SE has a single 12-megapixel camera on its back. It produces very good images in decent light with good colour balance, detail and dynamic range. Even in dull indoor settings it does admirably, but it lacks Apple’s night mode so images shot in the evening are dark and grainy by comparison. It shoots solid video too, particularly at this price point, while its selfie camera is similarly decent in good light but weak at night. Apple does not provide an expected lifespan for the iPhone SE’s battery but it can be replaced for £49. You should expect it to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 500 full charge cycles. Out-of-warranty screen replacements cost £146.44. The previous iPhone SE 2020 was awarded six out of 10 for repairability by the specialists iFixit. The phone contains 91% recycled rare earth metals, 100% recycled tungsten and at least 35% recycled plastic in various components, plus 100% recycled tin in the solder of its main board. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple also offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. The Apple iPhone SE 2022 costs from £419 ($429/A$719) with 64GB of storage, £469 ($479/A$799) with 128GB or £569 ($579/A$969) with 256GB. For comparison, the iPhone 13 mini costs £679, the iPhone 13 costs £779, the OnePlus Nord 2 costs £369, the Samsung Galaxy A53 costs £399, the Fairphone 4 costs £499 and the Google Pixel 6 costs £599. The iPhone SE is one of the best bargains in modern smartphones. It is not the flashiest or most feature-rich but it offers more bang for buck for longer than any other. It has an almost vintage design, lacks the MagSafe charging and accessory system, Face ID and other niceties of Apple’s more expensive models, but is otherwise a solid phone. At £419 it is Apple’s cheapest model, competing with mid-range devices from Samsung and myriad Chinese phone companies, many of which offer bigger, better screens, more cameras and greater storage. But unlike its rivals, it has Apple’s top chip, 5G, the latest version of iOS and will, crucially, be supported for a very long time with software and security updates – it should be safe to use for seven years or more. When even the best competition at this price tops out at only four years of updates, the iPhone SE will last longer than any other mid-range phone. And because it is an iPhone, it benefits from a huge ecosystem of third-party accessories, plus you can get it fixed if you break it and the battery can be replaced when it wears out. The starting 64GB of storage will be enough if you store your photos in the cloud and don’t download lots of games and movies. That makes the iPhone SE the best new smartphone for people who don’t really care about phones – it gets the job done and will last as long as possible. Pros: lowest-cost new iPhone, about seven years of software support, A15 chip, 5G, wireless charging, decent single-lens camera, top performance, easy to handle, water resistance, Touch ID, amazing value. Cons: battery life could be better, no headphone socket, no zoom camera, no Face ID, dated design, very slow charging, no MagSafe.

3/21/2022,"Last year I bought an iPad Pro from the Apple website. After six months of use I noticed that the frame had warped substantially, so I took it to the Apple store in London’s Covent Garden. The staff declared that the problem must have been caused by accidental damage and insisted that I pay a £350 out-of-warranty charge to replace it. I reluctantly paid up, and took the new iPad home, but within two days noticed that it, too, had developed a slight warp. The next day a thick band developed down the middle of the screen, making the iPad unusable. Back I went to the store – well within the 14-day timeframe Apple insists on – and was again told that this must be accidental damage. By now, very fed up, I contacted Apple’s customer support, which led me to understand that the shop would replace the iPad without further cost. But this was later refused. During the course of the conversations, Apple staff suggested that the bend might be the result, among other things, of the iPad being carried in a backpack. Ours has remained at home for the duration, and the second one was carried home in its box, and again didn’t leave the house. I have paid more than £1,000 and no longer have a working iPad. Interestingly, we have two other iPads in the house, one of which is 10 years old, and both are fine, suggesting to me that there is a design fault with this model, rather than anything we are doing. I also understand that I am not the only person to experience this. PD, Oxford In 2019 Apple was forced to admit that its latest iPad Pros were bending or warping very slightly, owing to the way the tablets were being manufactured. It followed a host of complaints from owners. Apple claimed, at the time, that this was not a defect. A similar problem also affected some iPhones warping when carried in people’s pockets, and the problem has since become known as “Bendgate”. Your letter, and a quick look online, suggest that the issue is ongoing. The company put out a directive on the subject in 2019 in which it invited customers whose iPads have deviated more than 0.4mm to contact it. I asked Apple about your case and, after initially saying that it would not be able to help you, it had a last-minute change of heart and says it will now replace your device. It says the first iPad you bought had been found to be out of warranty because the damage had been caused by you. It didn’t address the fact that its replacement had also failed. “On this occasion, Apple is offering to replace the iPad due to incorrect information given about the 14-day return policy, which does not apply for replacement devices,” it says. This suggests that those who pay its out-of-warranty fees, in return for a replacement, have no comeback if that item fails as well. Personally, I don’t think that position would stand up in court, but it wouldn’t be the first time Apple took such a stance. In 2016 the company was forced into a big U-turn after Guardian Money highlighted how the company was “bricking” iPhone 6s (ie, rendering them as technologically useful as a brick) if they had been repaired by a third party. This, in part, prompted the “right to repair” movement that has since taken off, and which Apple has resisted all the way.

3/21/2022,"“Are the bunkers in Albania still working?” my 11-year-old asked on hearing the news that Russia had invaded Ukraine. “Some,” I said. “Why?” “In case there is a war in Europe, and we need to find shelter,” he replied. I was his age one of the last times we “practised war” at school. At that time, all the bunkers worked, not only some – indeed they were one of the few things to still “work” in communist Albania. Once or twice a year an alarm would ring and we would rush out of our classrooms into the nearest shelter: a long, dark, underground tunnel that, legend had it, stretched all the way to the border with Yugoslavia – though nobody dared to venture more than a couple of hundred metres inside. When the cold war was over, the hundreds of thousands of bunkers built to allegedly protect people from the threat of nuclear war acquired a variety of new uses: from toilets in the wild to habitats for bats, from underground cafes to secret sites for lovers. It was a powerful symbol that the conflict between what we in Albania called the “imperialist west” and the “revisionist east” was now consigned to the past. When I was growing up, the perpetual threat of war was the condition for securing a perpetual peace at home: the kind of peace in which all dissent is suppressed and people have little choice but to comply. Over the course of the 20th century, my country progressively cut ties with the rest of the world. The more isolated it became, the more paranoid its political elites grew, the tighter their grip became on those who dared to disagree. This experience has been on my mind as I followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; I have become somewhat sceptical of the view that an extensive range of sanctions, which cuts off Russians from the rest of the world, will serve to delegitimise the Kremlin in their eyes. It has been impossible to not think about our own “war practice” as I’ve watched the chilling images of innocent Ukrainian citizens crowded in bunkers of the past, sheltering from bombs that must have seemed like an abstract, immaterial threat until they were not. Like us, they are the chess pieces in a fatal game of great power politics. But only some will be fortunate enough to survive until the next round. For many, the end of hostilities will be akin to the kind of peace mentioned by the philosopher Immanuel Kant in Toward Perpetual Peace, one of the most famous anti-war texts of the European Enlightenment: the perpetual peace of the graveyard. Written in 1795, at the height of the French revolutionary wars, Kant’s essay was heavily influenced by the French author Charles-Irénée Castel, abbé de Saint-Pierre. In 1712, shortly before the treaty of Utrecht, which inaugurated the era of great power politics that is alas still very much with us, Saint-Pierre advocated the creation of a European union of states that would include Russia. Both Saint-Pierre and Kant knew that a politics based on the balance of powers would never be able to produce a lasting peace. Future trade wars, civil wars and wars between states could hardly be avoided without the guarantee of a genuinely inclusive federation of states, where “the weakest would have enough security that the most powerful of the great powers would be unable to harm them”. The world might have looked very different if those projects had been pursued. Today, confronted by the realities of contemporary Europe, where Germany has decided to reverse a decades-long defence policy to ramp up its military spending, where Sweden and Finland contemplate accelerated accession to Nato, and where the prospect of nuclear war haunts even an 11-year-old born in London, they have a distinctively utopian ring. Where does one find hope? One misleading way to think about hope is as an attitude that sits somewhere between a desire and belief: a desire for a certain outcome and a belief that the outcome will be favourable. In that sense, to be hopeful means to observe the world and find evidence that the course of events supports a generally optimistic outlook. But when confronted with the brutality and destruction of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, it is difficult not to conclude, as Tolstoy does in War and Peace, that “the higher the human intellect goes in discovering more and more purposes, the more obvious it becomes that the ultimate purpose is beyond comprehension”. As we all struggle and fail to read the mind and purposes of Vladimir Putin, fear replaces rationality, the Leviathan unleashes its power, and all hope seems lost. But there is a different perspective from which to think about hope. Hope is needed most exactly when the world looks hopeless. For Kant, hope is not something you find in the world, it is a categorical imperative. We can retreat from each other or we can envisage political projects that are genuinely inclusive: a departure from the status quo, from the world of spheres of influence and boundaries that protect existing military and economic interests. Which of these attitudes prevails at any given point depends on the expectations we have for each other, on whether we see one another as targets to destroy or fellow humans with whom to engage. The European project of a cosmopolitan federation of states, including Russia, is discussed in the opening pages of War and Peace. “Perpetual peace is possible,” Tolstoy’s Pierre Bezukhov says, “but not by a balance of political power.” Tolstoy teaches us that even in the midst of fatal conflict, some confidence in the humanity of the enemy must remain. When hostilities degenerate into a war of extermination, Kant argues, all justice is destroyed and perpetual peace turns into “the vast burial ground of the human race”. In this world, no bunkers can be of any help. The greater the terror of war, the more pressing the moral duty to hope.

3/21/2022,"Q I’m an older first-time buyer and intend to get a mortgage on a property that is worth no more than £110,000. The mortgage period is 15 years and I have a 15% deposit. As I’m new to buying, I’m confused about fixed-term mortgages. Am I correct in thinking that, in theory, if I were to remortgage after a, say, two- to three-year fixed rate, the loan-to-value rate will have gone down, as I will have paid off some of my mortgage and the house presumably would have risen in value and therefore my mortgage payments would be a little less?RH A You are right in thinking that after two to three years of a repayment mortgage, you will have paid off some of the mortgage loan, so the percentage of the value of your home which the mortgage makes up will have gone down (assuming that the value is the same or greater than when you bought the property). This is the case with any repayment mortgage, not only fixed-rate loans. In the early years of a repayment mortgage it is true that most of the monthly mortgage payment is used to pay interest but a modest amount is also used to pay back the original loan. The percentage of the loan paid off at the end of the year can be a measly 1% at the end of the first year but will be more like 5% at the end of year three. Unless the interest rate changes, the monthly mortgage payments won’t change, so reducing the loan to value doesn’t reduce the monthly payments. But it can if you remortgage at the end of your fixed rate because you will find that the lower the loan-to-value, the better the interest rate that is offered. For example, with a variable tracker mortgage at HSBC, an 80% mortgage has an interest rate of 1.74%, while a mortgage of 90% of the value of a property has a rate of 1.84%.

3/21/2022,"Younger Australians are more likely to be anxious and depressed and also to binge drink and vape than older people, the latest health survey from the bureau of statistics suggests. Almost 19% of people aged 15 to 24 had anxiety and 14% had depression in 2020-21, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ latest National Health Survey released on Monday. Those figures steadily declined as people got older, and by the time Australians hit 75, just over 7% had anxiety and the same percentage had depression. Patrick McGorry, the executive director of youth mental health organisation Orygen and professor of youth mental health at the University of Melbourne, said a “perfect storm” hit people when they were young. “Every disorder” from anxiety and depression to eating disorders surged from puberty to peak when people were in their 20s, he said. “It’s a combination of biology and socioeconomic factors.” People were becoming adults, dealing with moving out of home, finding their identities, trying to start a career and finding an intimate partner. “There’s huge developmental stress, and the body and brain are still developing in a physical sense,” McGorry said. “And [there are] headwinds like pandemics, climate change, world wars, and the wealth transfer … from young people to baby boomers. They can’t buy houses and they’re under a lot of financial stress.” On top of all that, McGorry said, younger people were “too grown up for the child services and too early stage for the adult services”. He said Headspace – where he is a founding board member – had developed a blueprint to overcome that issue but it needed funding to be expanded. He is hopeful that whoever wins the May election will come up with the money. “I feel like I’m pushing on an open door,” he said. The ABS found 10.7% of adults were daily smokers; for those aged 18 to 24 it was 8.3%. While 83.3% of the younger age group had never smoked, 21.7% had tried vaping compared to just under 10% of adults overall. It was the first time the ABS surveyed people’s vaping habits. Laura Bajurny, an Alcohol and Drug Foundation spokesperson, said young people could easily get both nicotine and non-nicotine vapes online, that both were harmful, and that they were being aggressively marketed. “Social media marketing around vaping has been really aggressive and targeted at young people,” she said. The ABS survey also found one in four Australians drinks too much. About one in three men drinks more than 10 standard drinks a week, compared to about one in five women. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning People in the 18 to 24 age bracket were less likely than the average to have consumed more than ten drinks in the past week, but more likely to have consumed five or more on any day at least once a month. That’s consistent with “heavy episodic drinking”, Bajurny said. “The tragedy is that kind of heavy alcohol consumption is connected to some of the most common causes of death for young people – accidents and injuries including drownings, motor vehicle crashes. “We know that alcohol consumption is the second leading modifiable risk factor for suicide and self-harm in men.” It also found almost eight in 10 Australians have a long-term health condition. The conditions listed include cancer, diabetes and asthma, as well as short or longsightedness, hay fever and allergies. Of the 78.6% of people reporting a condition in 2020-21, about half had a chronic condition. The data was collected differently for the 2020-21 year, and cannot be compared to previous years, the ABS said. Youth mental health help is available from Headspace.

3/21/2022,"Former NSW deputy premier John Barilaro withdrew from public life and was “considering self-harm” after a series of YouTube videos by the comedian Jordan Shanks, a former adviser has told a court. Monday marked the first day of Barilaro’s trial against tech giant Google over videos posted by Shanks under the nom de plume FriendlyJordies in September and October 2020. Barilaro sued both Shanks and Google, the owner of YouTube, over the two videos titled bruz and Secret Dictatorship, claiming they were “vile and racist” and brought him into “public disrepute, odium, ridicule and contempt”. The claim against Shanks was settled in November last year, with Shanks apologising for any hurt caused, editing parts of two videos and paying legal costs but not damages. However the case against Google continued. During the hearing Barilaro’s former deputy chief of staff, Jeff McCormack, told the court the then member for Monaro had gone from being an “incredibly social” person with an “infectious energy and enthusiasm” to becoming withdrawn, including attempting to disguise himself while in public. McCormack told the court that he had been the one to show Barilaro the two videos at the centre of the case, and witnessed him becoming “very upset”. “Having known and worked so closely with John for the past 10 years you could see he was physically and emotionally very challenged by the videos,” he said. McCormack told the court Barilaro had received numerous threats following the publication of the videos, including to his family. “Having been a pollie for a while I think John was used to copping a bit of flack on the internet but I think that some of the comments, in particular the ones around his [family], were the ones he approached me [about] with real concern,” he said. Sitting in the courtroom, Barilaro wiped away tears as McCormack described the emotional toll he said the videos had on him. McCormack told the court that he had been with Barilaro on “several occasions” when he had been approached by members of the public making reference to the videos at the centre of the defamation case. He said the “confrontations” included people “making racist comments accusing him of corruption in front of his family, in front of his friends, in front of his children”. “It was extremely confronting because they were very aggressive in their nature,” he said. “I’ve worked in politics for a number of years on some pretty hotly contested campaigns; this was probably the most vile and aggressive confrontations I’ve witnessed.” McCormack said that after the second video was published in October 2020, Barilaro was considering resigning from parliament, and discussed self-harm. “John was basically at the physical point where he was considering self-harm and discussing resignation from his role and basically the video had gone beyond the pale,” he said. “He was very emotional during that conversation.” Google had initially sought to rely on defences of qualified privilege and honest opinion in publishing the two videos. But days out from the trial, the tech firm dropped the majority of its defences, bar the new public interest defence, which can only apply to publications made after 1 July, 2021, when the new Defamation Act came into force. Barilaro’s lawyers say the withdrawal of the other defences means the case is largely a matter of damages. On Monday Barilaro’s barrister, Sue Chrysanthou SC, told the court the videos led to him being “driven out of public office”. “The hate messages he received, people approaching him on the street, the harassment he felt and the hurt that caused him was instrumental in his decision to leave politics in October last year,” she said. Chrysanthou told the court the former deputy premier would seek aggravated damages “at the top of the range” against Google for what she described as its “extreme” conduct in publishing “offensive material” by Shanks. This included “terrible allegations” made against his lawyers by Shanks following the settlement that were “plainly absurd”, she said. “The only rational conclusion to be drawn is a motive on behalf of Google to waste my client’s time and money, or otherwise put pressure on him to settle the case, because he as an individual is confronted with a gargantuan company,” she said. “My client should have had a judgement against Google seven months ago [but its actions] caused my client to expend hundreds of thousands of dollars in this case as an individual against a company worth billions and billions.” Monday’s hearing also saw character witnesses for Barilaro, including the Canberra Raiders NRL coach Ricky Stuart. Stuart told the court he had known Barilaro for about 20 years, describing him as a “caring person” who was “very generous in his time”. “I know John can find himself talking to the prime minister [and being] at ease and very comfortable and or be at a pub in Queanbeyan making people around him feel very comfortable,” he said. “I’ve seen this first hand.

According to an update from the Sumy regional military administration, the site of the Sumykhimprom plant, which produces fertilisers, was shelled at 3.55am on Monday morning. “As a result of the shelling 1 tank with ammonia was damaged,” Ukraine’s state emergency services said in an update on its Telegram account, adding that as of 5am there was a slight leakage of ammonia. Rescue workers were fixing a damaged pipeline and an employee at the plant was reportedly injured. О 07:49 аварію по викиду аміаку у м.

He said the area within a 2.5km radius around the plant was hazardous, adding that residents should seek refuge in shelters and basements for protection while describing ammonia as a “colourless gas with a pungent suffocating odour”. “Ammonia is lighter than air, therefore shelters, basements and lower floors should be used for protection,” Zhyvytsky said in a Telegram message. He added that emergency crews were at the scene and prevailing winds meant the nearby city of Sumy – with a prewar population of about 250,000 – was not under immediate threat. According to Sumykhimprom’s website the facility produces a range of chemical fertilisers. Sumy, about 350km (220 miles) east of Kyiv, has experienced weeks of heavy fighting. In recent days the Russian government has intensified propaganda and disinformation efforts alleging Ukraine is preparing to use improvised chemical weapons and has been developing a clandestine weapon of mass destruction programme. The Russian Ministry of Defence claimed late Sunday that “nationalists” had “mined” ammonia and chlorine storage facilities at Sumykhimprom “with the aim of mass poisoning of residents of the Sumy region, in case of entry into the city of units of the Russian Armed Forces”. Russia has repeatedly denied helping Syria use chemical weapons in multiple attacks against its own citizens during the country’s 11-year-old civil war. Moscow has also denied using chemical weapons against Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny as well as ex Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.",News/World news,Ukrainian town told to shelter after shelling causes ammonia leak at chemical factory,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/ukrainian-town-told-to-shelter-after-shelling-causes-ammonia-leak-at-chemical-factory
3/21/2022,"Greetings from me, Warren Murray, on this Monday morning. Ukraine has defied a Russian military deadline that passed early this morning for Ukrainian forces to surrender the city of Mariupol. Many of the city’s 400,000 residents remain trapped with little if any food, water or power. Joe Biden will visit Poland on Friday, the White House has announced overnight. Shelling of Kyiv has continued, with at least four people killed when homes and the Retroville shopping district were hit, according to the state emergency service. Biden is due in Brussels on Thursday for Ukraine crisis talks with Nato allies, G7 leaders and EU leaders. The next day he will meet in Warsaw with Andrzej Duda, the president of Poland, Ukraine’s western neighbour where authorities say more than 2 million war refugees have arrived. Today, the US president will host a call about Ukraine with President Emmanuel Macron of France; the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz; the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi; and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told CNN on Sunday that a failure to end the war by negotiations could lead to “world war three” and he will be hoping that this week’s Nato summit in Brussels will provide him with more support. The Saudi state oil company Aramco has said it will increase its production of oil to meet rising global demand – raising hopes of an easing of soaring pump prices in western countries. From Taiwan, Helen Taylor writes how an article by a prominent Shanghai scholar academic that urged Beijing to cut ties with Putin’s regime received more than a million views before its website was blocked in China and the author was denounced.

Doctors identified lack of time with patients, workforce shortages, relentless workloads and heavy administrative burdens as the main reasons people receiving care could be exposed to risk. “The evidence shows that, after you’ve already made 25 to 35 decisions about patients’ health on a particular day, as a GP the risk of making a bad decision goes up,” said Dr Kieran Sharrock, deputy chair of the British Medical Association’s GP committee. A campaign called Rebuild General Practice is calling for urgent action to improve GP services and is backed by Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary. Tahbaz in Tehran hotel – Morad Tahbaz, who was left behind when Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were allowed to return home to the UK, has been taken from Evin prison to a hotel in Tehran after representations by the British and American governments, the Foreign Office has said. The department added it was lobbying the Iranian authorities to allow him to return to his Tehran home immediately as the Iranian government had previously pledged. His family said he launched a hunger strike in protest at being taken back to prison, which the Iranian government said was only to have an ankle tag fitted. The family have accused the Foreign Office of abandoning Tahbaz in order to secure the others’ release. Scotland’s policing lesson – It is a “moral imperative and operational necessity” for police forces across the UK to demonstrate no tolerance for misogyny, racism and discrimination within their ranks and across wider society, the head of Police Scotland, writing exclusively for the Guardian, has said. Iain Livingstone added that voices of survivors of sexual violence are “vital” in making improvements. Livingstone ordered an independent review in October after an industrial tribunal found evidence of a “sexist culture” in Scotland’s armed police. Another independent public inquiry is under way into the death in 2015 of Sheku Bayoh who was restrained by officers in Kirkcaldy, Fife. Khan: adopt Grenfell findings – Ministers have “failed to complete a single recommendation” from the first phase of the Grenfell Tower fire inquiries, Sadiq Khan has said. Recommendations made in October 2019 included regular inspections of lifts in residential high-rises; sharing of floorplans and cladding materials with fire and rescue services; and creation of national guidelines for evacuations. No deadline had been provided by the government for when these measures would come in, according to the London mayor’s office, whereas it said the London fire brigade (LFB) had completed 26 out of 29 recommendations. Khan said the government and the housing and building industries must act now, rather than wait for the inquiry’s phase 2 report – the hearings for which start on Monday. A housing department spokesperson said Khan’s claim was “unfounded … The government is making progress towards implementing the Grenfell Tower inquiry’s phase 1 recommendations.” Covid reboost – The NHS in England will start giving a second Covid booster today to five million over-75s, care home residents and immunocompromised people. They will be contacted by the NHS and be able to book an appointment online or by calling 119. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended the top-up. Cases of Covid are rising again, with 90,349 recorded on Friday across the UK, according to official figures, more than double the 39,000 seen on 1 March. The true number is higher: the Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 20 people in England had Covid in the week up to 12 March. The number of people in UK hospitals with Covid had risen to 14,671 by last Thursday. Pamela Moses, a Black Lives Matter activist, was sentenced to six years in prison for trying to register to vote.

For the second successive Test match it was England making all the running on the final day, throwing everything they could muster at West Indies only to end up shaking hands on another draw due to Kraigg Brathwaite’s remarkable powers of concentration. The Rugby Football Union has leapt to the defence of Eddie Jones, insisting the under-fire England head coach has the governing body’s full support and making the remarkable claim it is “encouraged by the solid progress” despite another highly disappointing Six Nations campaign. Two goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and one each from Ronald Araújo and Ferran Torres completed the scoring but not the story in Barcelona’s 4-0 thrashing of Real Madrid. Jürgen Klopp had conceded his scant knowledge of Nottingham extended to its association with Robin Hood and, until Diogo Jota poked in the winning goal 12 minutes from time to propel Liverpool into a FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City, he was in jeopardy of being on the wrong end of an upset that would have provided an unwanted memory. Bronze medals for Lorraine Ugen and Marc Scott spared Britain’s blushes on the final day of the world indoor championships – but they still endured their worst result in the competition since 2006. Labour has urged Kwasi Kwarteng to launch legal action against P&O Ferries over its “scandalous” decision to sack 800 workers without warning, which the party said is a criminal offence. It comes after the Trades Union Congress said ministers have serious questions to answer on the growing scandal and must make it a catalyst to improve workers’ rights. The FTSE100 is on track to shed 0.75% this morning while the pound is worth $1.315 and €1.191. The Guardian’s front-page lead today is “Thousands from Mariupol ‘being forced into Russia’” – a terrifying development if confirmed. “Russians accused of mass abductions” is how that story is presented in the Telegraph. The Times has “Russia accused of genocide”, an allegation levelled by Ukraine’s deputy PM. “Crime of the centuries” is what Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called it, the Metro reports. “Sheltering civilians bombed as fierce fighting grips Mariupol” – that’s the Financial Times’ lead story. “Our neighbours want us dead” – the i’s front page shows an elderly woman outside a bombarded house. Other papers turn to domestic matters. “Rishi’s set to cut tax on fuel” – that’s the Mail on first-name terms with the chancellor while the Express says “Fuel duty cut to ease cost of living crisis”. The Sun says “Don’t be a fuel, Rishi” calling on Sunak to cut duty at the pumps by more than 5p. The Mirror has “P&O in the dock” after the ferry line cut 800 jobs.
