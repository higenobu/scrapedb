1/22/2022,"The first day of March – St David’s Day – is always a joyful day in the harbour town of Porthmadog in north-west Wales. Children dress up in traditional outfits – or Welsh sports strips – while adults wear daffodils and families get together for a traditional supper. It feels like warmer, brighter days are around the corner. But the Welsh patron saint’s day is likely to be celebrated with particular vigour this year after Gwynedd council defied the UK government and declared it an extra bank holiday for about 5,000 of its staff.  “It’s a very good thing,” said Porthmadog library assistant Anne Roberts, one of those who will enjoy an extra day off. “This is a predominantly Welsh-speaking area. We are very proud of our country, our culture, our heritage. Lots of visitors seem to think we are just a part of England. This is a way of standing up to that, of celebrating our Welshness.” While other Celtic nations in the UK have a day off to celebrate their patron saints, Wales does not. Some citizens take it off anyway – the Welsh actor Richard Burton, for one, did not like the idea of working on St David’s Day. But Gwynedd council, which is controlled by Plaid Cymru, decided it ought to be a holiday for everyone and wrote to the UK government, which has responsibility for bank holidays in England and Wales, asking for its blessing. The answer was a firm no, with a junior minister writing back that it would have a negative impact on business, so the council’s cabinet this week decided to go it alone. While it cannot order that everyone be given the day off, it ruled that its workers would be given an extra bank holiday. Nia Jeffreys, the cabinet member for corporate support and the member for Porthmadog East, said there had been “massive” support throughout Wales and messages of solidarity from around the world. She admitted there were some who questioned the cost (an estimated £200,000) but said her argument was that the two bank holidays that have been arranged to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee this year would – obviously – cost double that. Jeffreys said she thought making more of St David’s Day could boost the economy by bringing more visitors in. “But it’s about allowing us to celebrate our country, our values,” she said. Business owners said they would think about giving their staff time off. “It could be good for business,” said Jolene Barton, who runs the Porthmadog company Babi Pur, selling ethical products for babies and children. “It can be a way of bringing staff together.” Mechanic Garun Roberts said he and his family usually got together for a Welsh stew on St David’s Day. “This is putting Gwynedd on the map. It’s a good thing,” he said. Because teachers’ terms and conditions are negotiated across England and Wales, the schools in Gwynedd will not be able to close for the extra day. “That may be a good thing,” said Llywela Jones, whose eight-year-old son Tomos used to wear a waistcoat and flat cap on St David’s Day but now prefers his Welsh football shirt. “The schools do a nice job of celebrating the day. The children have a good time with their classmates.” But the issue is unlikely to stop here. Plaid Cymru’s Westminster leader is planning to raise the subject in the House of Commons. She said: “Plaid Cymru has made the argument to successive Westminster governments that people in Wales deserve to be able to celebrate our national day properly, and we’ve been refused each time. “I commend Gwynedd for showing the leadership to act decisively. I can’t think of a better year to start giving workers a holiday after the last 24 months of the Covid pandemic.” Cian Ciarán, the keyboard player with the revered Welsh band Super Furry Animals, who was born in Gwynedd and is a passionate supporter of independence, said he hoped other councils would do the same. “This is an unequal, divided and imposed union, it’s about time people woke up to that fact and sought self-determination. I would call on all councils in Wales to follow suit, to stand with them in solidarity.” In Porthmadog, florist Susan Owen is getting ready for another special event on Tuesday – St Dwynwen’s Day, a Welsh version of St Valentine’s Day. “Of course we should mark these days for our country, our language, our sense of togetherness. It’s so important.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Celebrate our Welshness’: Gwynedd council gives staff St David’s Day off,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/21/celebrate-our-welshness-gwynedd-council-gives-staff-st-davids-day-off
1/22/2022,"China, the world’s second largest economy, should review its zero-tolerance approach to the pandemic or risk damaging the global recovery, according to the head of International Monetary Fund. Kristalina Georgieva said Beijing should reassess the use of lockdowns to limit the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant since it became clear the harm to human health was less severe than the Delta variant.  Speaking at the World Economic Forum on a virtual panel, she said that while the hardline approach had contained the pandemic in China for “quite some time”, the restrictions were now proving to be a burden on the economy in China and globally. Millions of people in Henan province were ordered into lockdown earlier this month after China’s national health commission reported 87 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases. Other provinces have also been affected by shutdowns in recent weeks, while Hong Kong has banned passengers from 150 destinations from coming to the island. Georgieva said the slowdown in economic growth in China was due to interruptions caused by Covid-19 lockdowns, which harmed consumer spending. “China is still using a zero-Covid policy. But what Covid is teaching all of us is that a highly transmissible variant may be much more difficult to contain without a dramatic impact on the economy,” she said. The IMF boss also chastised the Chinese authorities for withdrawing financial support to protect workers and businesses too early, saying that the economy continued to need subsidies from the government and for the central bank to keep interest rates low. Earlier this week the People’s Bank of China cut the main mortgage rate. Many analysts in the City believe there could be more rate cuts to follow. US Federal Reserve officials were praised for signalling an increase in interest rates in advance, allowing Americans and foreign businesses that have borrowed money in dollars to prepare for higher interest payments. But Georgieva warned the US that a steep rise in interest rates would hurt many developing countries that were already highly indebted and struggling to cope with the pandemic, forcing them to seek help from the IMF. The Fed is expected to increase interest rates next week in response to a surge in prices that pushed inflation to 7%. The IMF warning came as Catherine Mann, a member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said inflationary pressures in the UK could remain “strong for longer” amid a worsening squeeze on living costs. The independent economist on the nine-strong panel said there were few signs that high global shipping costs for business would fade soon amid continued pandemic disruption, while rising energy costs and higher wage settlements for workers could embed stronger levels of inflation. “It should be a concern that the costs from 2021 are becoming reflected in price expectations for 2022,” she said. In comments before Threadneedle Street’s next rate-setting meeting on 3 February, she said the Bank should “lean against” expectations for inflation to remain persistently high. Analysts expect the central bank to raise rates to 0.5%, after lifting its key interest rate from a record low of 0.1% to 0.25% in December. In a statement that appeared to reveal her preference for the central bank to convey a need for higher rates without accelerating the pace of planned increases this year, she added: “The ingredients appear to be in place for inflation to stay strong for longer, but costs becoming embedded in prices to create a reinforcing dynamic is not inevitable.”",News/Business,IMF warns China over cost of Covid lockdowns,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/21/imf-warns-china-over-cost-of-covid-lockdowns
1/22/2022,"Allegations that MPs have been intimidated compound damage done to Britain’s reputation from threats by the government to deliberately break international law, observers have warned. Philippe Sands QC, a leading barrister and expert on human rights, said there was a direct parallel between alleged threats to reduce funding to MPs’ constituencies and examples of “threatening behaviour” which he alleged Boris Johnson had engaged in while foreign secretary.  “We now have a government that has no commitment to the rule of law, disrespect for judges, domestic and international. And that is picked up around the world, whether it is at the UN or in other places,” he added, referring to the government’s admission in 2020 that its plan to reinterpret the special Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland would break international law. “Everyone is watching what is going on and there has been a collapse in the appreciation of Britain’s reputation and the British brand of reliability and trust,” he said. He added: “I’m involved in one case involving the United Kingdom, in which the tactic of the technique of bullying and threats was used personally by Boris Johnson, and completely backfired. With threatening to reduce funding to MPs, there is a direct parallel with threats made against a friendly country.” No finding of wrongdoing has been reached. No 10 has been contacted for comment about Sands’ claims. Douglas Alexander, a former international development secretary in Gordon Brown’s Labour government, also framed the latest controversy at Westminster in international terms at a time when Britain and others were competing to promote democratic ideals against alternative models put forward by Russia and other states. “Blackmail should have no place in democratic governance. The UK has a long history of speaking up for human and democratic rights internationally, but our credibility abroad rests on our conduct at home,” said Alexander, who is now senior fellow at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. “At a time when democracy is being challenged globally by authoritarian regimes, the collapse of standards and the casual disregard for international law shown by this government have been deeply damaging to the UK’s international reputation. “The conduct within the UK government that has been revealed in recent weeks is burning like battery acid through not just long established standards and norms of behaviour but also the UK’s standing abroad as a beacon of trustworthy democratic governance.” By contrast, Mark Lyall Grant, a former UK national security adviser and permanent representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations, presented a more nuanced view. “The threat to break international law was serious and potentially at least had implications for the UK’s standing – though I have not seen any evidence that it did in practice. The latest claims of blackmail are a Westminster bubble story of little resonance overseas – and so have no implications for UK’s reputation/standing. Indeed, do they go much beyond standard whip’s behaviour over the years?” But Alexandra Hall, a former British diplomat in charge of explaining Brexit to the US government – who resigned in 2019 saying she was no longer prepared to “peddle half-truths on behalf of a government I do not trust” – was scathing of the government and this week’s events. “It may soon be over for Johnson, but unfortunately not for us, who face an unappetising choice of future PM, and a huge hill to climb for whoever that is to address the mess he’s left behind, and restore the UK’s international reputation,” tweeted Hall, a former ambassador to Georgia.",News/Politics,"MP blackmail claims add to UK’s poor reputation overseas, says top lawyer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/21/mp-blackmail-claims-add-to-uks-poor-reputation-overseas-says-top-lawyer
1/22/2022,"Thanks for the article from Sally Weale about the teaching of “synthetic phonics” (Focus on phonics to teach reading is ‘failing children’, says landmark study, 19 January). At last, some common sense! In my experience as an educational psychologist visiting many primary schools over the course of 20 years, the sudden rigid adherence to synthetic phonics introduced by Michael Gove in 2012 caused more harm than good to children struggling with literacy. Children were being drilled in phonics before they knew what a word looked like, then judged as “failing” if they could not recall or relate to this decontextualised methodology. Some children would mechanistically “blend” the sounds to form a word yet completely fail to make the connection between this and the natural sound of the word. Furthermore, I met a number of conscientious teachers who saw themselves judged as failing if some children were underperforming in phonics tests.  Phonics were always part of the armoury of a skilled teacher of reading, but there would be so many other approaches at their fingertips in recognition of the fact that children vary in their cognition and in their background experience with books. These skills have been severely suppressed and actively discouraged during the past 10 years, often by headteachers anxious about their Ofsted rating, and only the brave soldiered on following their innate sense of how children acquired literacy skills and a love of reading.Eleanor AllanAbberley, Worcestershire  If only those who make momentous decisions in education actually consulted those who teach, life would be so much happier. When this ludicrous emphasis on phonics was propounded by Michael Gove, I was astonished. Studying the way children learn to read and an emphasis on contextual understanding is crucial. Phonics plays its part, as in learning any language, but the mistaken belief that this is the only way to teach reading can be damaging. An approach to reading where encouragement to understand what’s going on in a text and getting the children to think about the words is vital, especially if we wish them to enjoy the experience. A combination of all approaches is what’s needed. Paired reading, where an adult reads alongside the child in a relaxed manner, without judgmental comment, is so valuable. Overriding all of this should be a desire to ensure an enjoyment of reading for its own sake. Reading should never become a chore, but solely learning phonics makes it one.Catherine RoomeStaplehurst, Kent  Anyone who has ever shared a book with a young child knows that learning to read is like catching an infection. The more fun that can be brought to it, the more likely the reading bug will be caught. A sterile process, such as the synthetic phonics method, was never going to show impressive results. All hail Michael Rosen, who understands this perfectly, and who gave teachers such inspirational material.Joan LewisSaint-Étienne-de-Gourgas, France  Children taught to read before the imposition of systematic synthetic phonics as the sole method for early learners were offered a variety of experiences, always involving some phonics but also word recognition, cueing and other approaches to extracting meaning from meaningful texts. In the light of the evidence, that eclectic approach to early reading clearly needs to be reinstated and the ethos of child-informed education reinforced for young learners.Prof Colin RichardsFormer HM inspector of primary education  My four-year-old granddaughter, who started school last September, made Christmas cards this year for all her family. On the top of each, she wrote: “We wish you were merry Christmas.” I think we all understood the message.Angela PorrittShipbourne, Kent  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/22/2022,"On the wild and remote west coast of New Zealand’s South Island, an old dame is getting a hot-pink makeover, with all the synthetic flowers, coloured beads and glitter she can take. Her name is Gloria, and she is an 83-year-old church, on her way to becoming a public sculpture and “queer beacon” for the local community. “I didn’t grow up in the church, I grew up in a Jewish household, but mostly I grew up making things, and in recent years I’ve become more and more excited about queer celebration,” says poet and artist Sam Duckor-Jones.  Gloria, built in 1939, was formerly the St Peter’s Anglican Church in Greymouth, a town of roughly 14,000 people, on the map more for its mining history than mardi gras. When Duckor-Jones felt ready to move from his home north of Wellington two years ago, but struggled to find an affordable home in the capital city, he searched the internet for “the cheapest house in New Zealand”. The church, which had been unused since 2000, popped up, and Duckor-Jones promptly fell in love. He immediately set out to convert it into a “queer place of worship”, a sculpture (“not a renovation”) with 50 larger-than-life papier-mache congregation members. He will live there until the sculpture is finished, which he anticipates will take five years. What people choose to worship, or how the public wishes to use the space, is entirely up to them, but creating a place for rural queerness to thrive is top of mind. “I really want them to feel some ownership for Gloria and feel like it’s their space they can come and hang out in or keep adding to after I move on.” Gloria’s name was chosen as a hat-tip to Christian hymns, disco and a make-believe character Duckor-Jones and his brother created when they were children. “I put play at the very very top of everything that is important in the world.” And playful it is – a campy pink wonderland with tinsel curtains and a neon “Gloria” sign. “I’ve always really enjoyed pink. Also, I like pushing a little bit of pink on the world. It’s not subtle – it says, ‘look at me’. It’s got its whole history with queerness, pride, gay liberation and gender. It is really powerful that people have strong feelings about pink, like they have about no other colour.” When Duckor-Jones speaks of Gloria, he does so with the same reverence held for an elder, or a person with a character of their own. “I’m a nice, warm person but I’ve never been very good at participation in the community. But Gloria just wouldn’t have a bar of that attitude. People are just coming from far and wide and want to celebrate her with me.” Since embarking on the project, local residents have been popping by, offering tools, relaying local history and embracing the bright queer beacon emerging on their quiet street. “I wanted Gloria to belong to the community, because I thought, at some point someone will do something stupid, like tag it or burn it down, and I want the community to be as outraged as well,” he says with a laugh. Reclamation of traditional spaces and practices by queer communities has a long history, as does the collision of rural locales and queerness in popular culture. Duckor-Jones’ project has already drawn parallels with the English artist Derek Jarman’s Dungeness home, the gay activist group Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence and the cult drag film Priscilla Queen of the Desert. “I like promoting a kind of quiet fabulosity,” Duckor-Jones says. “I really like sitting by myself crocheting but wearing, you know, a pink silk gown with some mascara, listening to Judy [Garland].” “Gloria is kind of a representation of that – of being glittery and ridiculous and over the top, in small town New Zealand, in a quiet little corner where it rains a lot. Take that, Sydney.”",News/World news,‘Quiet fabulosity’: remote New Zealand church gets pink makeover to celebrate queer community,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/quiet-fabulosity-remote-new-zealand-church-gets-pink-makeover-to-celebrate-queer-community
1/22/2022,"It was the week Tonga disappeared. Riveted by the shocking satellite images of the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano and subsequent tsunami, the eyes of the world turned to the South Pacific island country, home to about 100,000 people, on Saturday. But just as the world was desperate for news from Tonga, it went dark.  Damage to the undersea cable that supplies Tonga’s internet and much of its communication infrastructure has meant the extent of the damage there, and the death toll, has, for many days, gone largely unknown. Even the smallest slivers of information have been seized upon by the Tonga diaspora, desperate for news of their loved ones. The Tongan government, when it was finally able to broadcast a statement to the world three days after the disaster, announced that Tonga had suffered an “unprecedented disaster”; that the waves from the tsunami reached 15m high on some islands, and that at least three people had died. Almost one week on, much is still unknown. Calls to Tonga still do not connect, or if they do, drop out after just seconds. The internet is still almost impossible to access. And while some aid has finally landed, this is also not without its complications: with fears that aid workers could bring Covid-19 to a country that has recorded just a single case throughout the entire pandemic. This is how Tonga’s week of disaster unfolded: The air across Tonga smelled like sulphur, as it had done for weeks due to the active Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano, which lies 65km from Tonga’s capital of Nuku’alofa. At 5.10pm local time, four loud volcanic explosions rocked the country. The blasts from the volcano could be heard in Fiji and Vanuatu, where people shared videos of their homes shaking for hours. It was also felt in New Zealand, more than 2,000km away. The eruption prompted a tsunami. Later the government of Tonga would announce that on some islands, the waves were up to 15m high. Branko Sugar and his son were spearfishing on an outer reef when the volcano erupted and tsunami waves came. “We stopped the boat and just looked. Then we saw the wave coming towards us. The biggest wave I’ve ever seen,” Sugar told Reuters. Sugar turned his boat, a 400-horsepower 27-foot (8 metre) World Cat catamaran, and accelerated toward deep water near Eueiki Island. “That’s what saved us, the power of the boat,” he said. “I shouldn’t be alive.” “The wave came past us and hit the main island, and then we knew we’d managed to get away. But then the rocks started raining. It was raining stones,” he recalled. The sky turned to total darkness, as ash enveloped everything. Ash and rocks rained from the sky. Iliesa Tora, a journalist based in the capital of Nuku’alofa, who contributes to the Guardian, did a Facebook Live from his car as he was stuck in a long line of traffic trying to get to higher ground in Nuku’alofa, the capital. He turned the camera to show the darkness and falling rocks outside his car. “Pray for Tonga,” he said. On Sunday, there was silence. Almost all communication was shut off, as it became clear that damage had been done to Tonga’s all-important undersea communications cable. Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, told a news conference that contact had not been established with coastal areas beyond the capital, Nuku’alofa. “Nuku’alofa is covered in thick plumes of volcanic dust but otherwise conditions are calm and stable,” Ardern said. Meanwhile, the volcano was making itself felt around the world. Large waves and strong currents were recorded in many coastal areas globally. Two people drowned off a beach in the Lambayeque region of Peru, after unusually high waves were recorded there. The ash cloud lifted across Tongatapu, the main island of Tonga, for the first time since Saturday and blue skies were seen again. Dr Faka’iloatonga Taumoefolau, a project coordinator for the Tonga Parliament Buildings Project, tweeted a thread of images and videos on Thursday, when he was able to get a brief spot of internet. One video, taken on 17 January, showed the streets covered in ash. “I took this video because up until this point it was almost as if I had forgotten what a day was like with sunlight,” he wrote. “Heading to work for the first time after the calamity, had to help. You start to see more visibly the scale of the damage. Even the top of Mala’e Aloa [a cemetery in Nuku’alofa] wasn’t spared and fences – be it wood, plants, or brick cement – just brushed away like it was nothing.” Tongans around the world waited desperately for news. It was confirmed the communications cable was broken in two places and it could be weeks before normal services resume. “We’ve heard nothing at all,” said Seini Taumoepeau, a Tongan-Australian artist and activist based in Sydney. “I would say I’ve had four hours [of sleep each night] at the most.” News emerged on Monday of the first death from the disaster – a 50-year-old British woman named Angela Glover. Her brother described in an interview with the Guardian how Glover and her husband were swept away by the tsunami. Her husband was able to cling to a tree, but she was not. Her body was found late on Monday. The first official update from the Tongan government was published. The government called the incident an “unprecedented disaster” and confirmed three deaths: Briton Angela Glover, a 65-year-old woman from Mango island and 49-year-old man from Nomuka island, whose names have not been released. The government expressed serious concerns about water supplies being affected by volcanic ash. Meanwhile, aerial photographs were leaked from a surveillance mission undertaken by the New Zealand defence force. The images showed for the first time the scale of the damage across the islands, with some areas unaffected but for ash covering all surfaces, whereas other areas suffer from “catastrophic damage”. There were particular concerns for the remote islands of Mango, where all houses were destroyed, and Fonoifua, where just two houses remained. But the images also showed people already at work cleaning the debris and ash. One image, taken of the south-eastern runway of the Fua’amotu International Airport, showed a group of people with shovels and wheelbarrows clearing the runway, to make it safe for planes to land. The first aid shipments left for Tonga from New Zealand, amid fears that relief efforts could bring a “tsunami of Covid” to the Covid-free nation and more images begin to emerge of the damage. Some contact was restored and Pacific social media filled with relieved tweets and posts from people who have finally been able to make contact with loved ones. “I can finally get some good rest after hearing both my parents’ voices this evening,” tweeted Sera Lenora Lala. Another person tweeted: “I missed a call because I thought it was a reporter but it was my dad,” with sobbing emojis. “He left a voicemail, thank God for that! Sitting here replaying it gives me so much comfort.” The miraculous story of Lisala Folau emerged from Tonga. Lisala Folau, a retired disabled carpenter, told Tongan radio station Broadcom FM that he swam and floated from his island of Atata via two other uninhabited islands to eventually reach the main island of Tongatapu, a total distance of around 13 kilometres. Folau’s remarkable story, which included him hearing his son call to him from the shore after he had been swept into the night but deciding not to respond because he didn’t want his son to risk his life by coming in after him, and of seeing a police rescue boat and frantically waving at it, but it not seeing him, captured global attention. People got out to the streets to assist with cleanup efforts: clearing roads of debris and ash. There were reports of people collecting the volcanic ash to use as fertiliser on their plantations, and also of people making it into speed humps on the road to encourage people to drive more slowly, so their cars would not spray ash onto people’s homes. As more power was restored around the country and satellite links were established, more images and video emerged, showing the scale of the destruction and the huge rebuilding effort ahead. Roughly 20% of Tongans live below the poverty line, and the country’s GDP per capita sits at just above US$5,000. Much of the economy of the country is based on remittances, with Tongans overseas sending money back to the islands. Families in the Tonga diaspora in Australia, New Zealand and the US were already raising funds for recovery efforts and preparing for rebuilding, which is expected to take years. “Thanks for all the messages. Can’t get through them all. Limited network,” tweeted Ana Tupou Panuve, a senior economist with the National Reserve Bank of Tonga. “Country in recovery mode. ‘Ofa atu (love you).”",News/World news,Diary of a disaster: the week that Tonga went silent,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/diary-of-a-disaster-the-week-that-tonga-went-silent
1/22/2022,"We Don’t Talk About Bruno, from the animated film Encanto, has become the first original Disney song to reach No 1 in the UK charts. Written by Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, it has taken over the lives of children – and their parents – in much the same way as Let It Go, from Disney film Frozen, did nearly a decade ago.  The ensemble song, telling the story of the mysterious uncle Bruno in Miranda’s typically rhythmic and loquacious style, is performed by Rhenzy Feliz, Adassa, Stephanie Beatriz, Mauro Castillo, Diane Guerrero and Carolina Gaitán. Another song from the soundtrack, Surface Pressure – performed by Jessica Darrow – is at No 5 this week, while The Family Madrigal, a song that introduces the rural Colombian world of the film, is at No 15. Gareth Gates, the singer who came to fame on 2002’s Pop Idol before having four UK No 1s, might argue that he had the first Disney song to reach No 1. His recording of Elvis Presley’s Suspicious Minds, one half of a double A-side single with Pop Idol winner Will Young in 2002, was included on the soundtrack to Disney film Lilo & Stitch. We Don’t Talk About Bruno is therefore – strictly speaking – the first original Disney song to reach the top. The quick and explosive popularity of We Don’t Talk About Bruno, abetted by its viral manifestation on TikTok, where fans act out various characters, means it has become a chart success in a way that other Disney songs have not previously managed. The ubiquitous Let It Go was more of a slow-burn success, reaching a high of No 11 in its 70 weeks on the UK chart, beginning in 2013. Celine Dion earned her first UK Top 10 hit with her title ballad from 1992’s Beauty and the Beast, which reached No 9, while Elton John had two Top 20 hits with songs from The Lion King in 1994: Circle of Life and Can You Feel the Love Tonight. The big ballad from Aladdin, A Whole New World, reached No 12 in 1994, performed by Peabo Bryson – also Dion’s duet partner on Beauty and the Beast – and Regina Belle. It’s the biggest success yet for Miranda during his tenure at Disney, where he has frequently acted and contributed songs, beginning with 2016’s animated fable Moana. He has acted in the studio’s Mary Poppins Returns and DuckTales, written music for the final Star Wars film trilogy, and collaborated with longtime Disney songwriter Alan Menken on songs for the forthcoming live action remake of The Little Mermaid, to be released in 2023. Miranda also wrote 11 songs and provided voice acting for the Sony Pictures Animation film Vivo, released in July 2021. We Don’t Talk About Bruno knocks last week’s No 1, the sweary teen angst anthem ABCDEFU by 17-year-old singer Gayle, to No 2. Adele’s Easy on Me spends its 14th week on the chart at No 3, and Nigerian vocalist Fireboy DML’s track Peru, assisted by Ed Sheeran on a remix, rises to No 4.

1/22/2022,"British petrochemicals company Ineos is facing a legal challenge over plans to build a giant plastics plant in Antwerp. Environmental law firm ClientEarth on Friday launched an appeal against Antwerp’s decision to grant Ineos a permit to build a chemicals installation to make ethylene from fracked US shale gas, the Guardian has learned.  Ineos’ billionaire owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, announced a €3bn investment in Antwerp in January 2019 at a signing ceremony with top Flemish politicians. “We’ll become stronger in Europe as a petrochemicals player,” said the businessman, an ardent Brexit supporter, who lives in tax-free Monaco. Acting for 13 green NGOs, including Greenpeace and WWF, ClientEarth said the project has not met the EU legal requirement of a full assessment of the impact on the environment, including greenhouse gas emissions and wildlife. “We already have more plastics than we need,” said ClientEarth lawyer Tatiana Luján. “Beyond the local effects on nature and health [Ineos] project one would cause, we cannot ignore that the basis of this project is fossil fuels, and they’ll be used to create the building blocks of plastics.” The NGOs say the project will fuel the production of single-use plastics, thus failing to match the requirements of EU waste reduction strategies and climate commitments. Antwerp authorities, which granted the permit last December, are also accused of having failed to consider the plant’s lifetime greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the damage nitrogen pollution would wreak on local wildlife. Separately, the Dutch province of Zeeland announced earlier this month it would appeal Antwerp’s decision, arguing that “no appropriate assessment has been made” of the impact of increased nitrogen on its nature reserves. Flanders is already suffering from excess nitrogen, a result of intensive farming and industry, according to local NGOs. Across the north-western Belgian region, nitrogen emissions have turned purple heather into straw, clear water into brown sludge and accelerated the disappearance of flowers, bees and butterflies. Ineos says the ethylene “cracker” is the largest petrochemicals investment in Europe for a generation and will create 450 jobs on site and up to 2,250 in other companies. Construction is scheduled to begin later this year at the port of Antwerp, where the company has its roots. Using intense heat and pressure, the installation “cracks” the bonds in ethane gas to create ethylene, which can then be turned into polyethylene, used to make packaging and plastic bottles. Ineos disputes the claim the cracker will fuel single-use plastics, highlighting that ethylene can also be used to make water and gas pipes, healthcare products, lighter cars and blades for wind turbines. It also claims that ethylene buyers could save 2m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year by buying from its plant, rather than older rivals. The NGOs are unconvinced. “Maybe this plant will be more carbon efficient than other crackers that we have,” Luján said. “But crackers have a lifetime. If you create a new one you lock in the extraction of fuels and the production of plastics for another 30 years, when what we should be doing is scaling down on our use and production of petrochemicals for plastics.” The EU has pledged to phase out some single-use plastics, including cutlery, cotton buds, straws and stirrers, but campaigners fear a tide of cheap fracked US shale gas will create a new boom in plastics. Others say anti-plastics regulation could mean the industry over-expands, leaving taxpayers on the hook as expensive installations are no longer needed and become stranded assets. “One of our biggest fears is that we not only use Flemish taxpayer money to guarantee an economic activity, which is such an ecologically bad thing to do right now, but that we will be linked to an economic activity that is not as economically viable as first thought,” said Frank Vanaerschot of FairFin, one of the NGOs backing the case. The Flemish region enticed Ineos to build the cracker with a government guarantee worth €250m-€500m (£209m-£418m) according to local media, although that was before the project was scaled back. Last year Ineos announced it was putting on hold plans to produce propylene at Antwerp, another raw material used to make plastics. Vanaerschot fears the plant creates perverse incentives for Belgium, which is not on track to meet its 2030 climate targets. “There will be a conflict of interest between having strong ecological regulations – which we really need – and the economic interests of this company.” Ineos has been contacted for comment. When the permit was granted in December, the company said it was setting a new environmental standard: “Our ethane cracker will have the lowest carbon footprint in Europe: three times lower than the average European steam cracker and less than half of that of the 10% best performers in Europe.”",News/Business,Ineos faces legal challenge over plans for plastics plant in Antwerp,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/21/ineos-faces-legal-challenge-over-plans-for-plastics-plant-in-antwerp
1/22/2022,"Chile’s millennial president-elect, Gabriel Boric, has named a progressive cabinet, with a ministerial team which for the first time anywhere in the Americas is dominated by women. Boric, a 35-year-old former student leader, will replace the billionaire rightwing president Sebastián Piñera on 11 March as he becomes the youngest president in Chile’s history.  Fourteen women and 10 men – with an average age of 49 – were named as ministers on Friday, in a cabinet which combines experienced moderates with former leaders from the 2011 education protest movement where Boric forged his political ideals. “We have put together this group of people who are well-prepared, who have knowledge and experience, who are committed to the programme of changes that the country needs, and have the capacity to combine viewpoints, different perspectives and new visions,” said Boric at a ceremony outside Santiago’s natural history museum. As Boric sets about healing the wounds of Chile’s incomplete transition to democracy after Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship, his ministerial picks reflect his aim to build a fairer, more inclusive country. Chile’s new defence minister is the granddaughter of the socialist president Salvador Allende, who was deposed in Pinochet’s bloody 1973 coup d’état. Maya Fernández, 50, will preside over long-overdue reforms of the military that overthrew Chile’s democracy. The cabinet also includes two prominent former student protest leaders: Giorgio Jackson, 34, Boric’s political campaign adviser, will be secretary general, and Camila Vallejo, 33, a Communist party politician who preceded Boric as the leader of the University of Chile’s student union, will be the government’s spokesperson. Dr Izkia Siches, 35, the popular former head of the national medical union, will be the first woman ever to preside over Chile’s interior ministry. At 32, the new minister for women and gender equality, Antonia Orellana, is the youngest member of the cabinet. Among the moderate voices is the former Socialist party politician and current central bank chief Mario Marcel, a 62-year-old educated at the University of Cambridge, who has been named finance minister. Marcela Ríos, 55, a sociologist who has worked for the United Nations Development Programme for the majority of her career, will become justice minister. Boric’s sports minister, Alexandra Benado, 45, is a former national team footballer whose mother was murdered by state agents while she was a member of the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria (MIR). She is the first openly lesbian minister in Chile’s history. She is the coordinator of the Londres 38 memorial, housed in a discreet townhouse in central Santiago used as a torture and execution centre by Gen Pinochet’s secret police, the Dina. Boric will be sworn in as president on 11 March.",News/World news,"Chile’s president-elect names progressive, majority-women cabinet",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/chile-gabriel-boric-cabinet-majority-women
1/22/2022,"Hundreds of letters of support have poured in for a nun in Kerala after a court acquitted a bishop accused of raping and abusing her over two years, in the first case of its kind to hit the Indian Catholic church. The handwritten letters from activists, artists, journalists, film-makers and fellow nuns across India have expressed outrage at last week’s court verdict that cleared Bishop Franco Mulakkal of all charges of sexual abuse after the judge said the victim, a 50-year-old nun, was not a “sterling witness”.  Mulakkal, who headed the Roman Catholic diocese of Jalandhar, was accused of raping the nun on 13 occasions at the Missionaries of Jesus convent in Kottayam, Kerala, between 2014 and 2016. The nun took her case to police in June 2018, and in 2019 Mulakkal was formally charged with wrongful confinement, rape, unnatural sex and criminal intimidation, becoming the first Indian bishop to be arrested in connection with sexual abuse. Mulakkal denied all allegations. The landmark case exposed deep divisions and systemic flaws within the Indian Catholic church when it came to addressing allegations of sexual assault. It was only taken seriously after fellow nuns protested in support of the alleged victim. The trial, which began in 2020, lasted almost two years, and last Friday Judge G Gopakumar found Mulakkal not guilty of all charges. Gopakumar questioned why it had taken the nun so long to report the full extent of the alleged sexual abuse and expressed doubts over her testimony and motives. Gopakumar said there had been “exaggerations and embellishments” in the nun’s witness statement, and that she had been “swayed under the influence of others who had vested interests in the matter” and “made every attempt to hide certain facts”. “The in-fight and rivalry and group fights of the nuns, and the desire for power, position and control over the congregation, is evident in the case,” wrote the judge. “The claim of the victim that she was raped on 13 occasions under duress cannot be taken reliance on the basis of her solitary testimony. There is no consistency in the statement of the victim.” B Kemal Pasha, a former judge at the Kerala high court, called the verdict a miscarriage of justice, adding that a “delay in reporting such a case cannot be the reason for the acquittal”. S Harisankar, the police chief who oversaw the case, said he had “fully expected a conviction” and the verdict would “send a wrong message to society”. In an effort to show widespread support for the nuns who have been fighting the case and urging them not to be disheartened by the verdict, a letter-writing campaign began in India this week. Hundreds of handwritten letters to the nuns have been posted on social media expressing solidarity. The actor Geetu Mohandas wrote a “note of gratitude, of thanks, for standing tall to tell your story where many have been silenced.” Another actor, Rima Kallingal, spoke of how she had been inspired and strengthened by the sisters. “I will never be able to thank you enough for this new chapter for Kerala,” she wrote.

1/22/2022,"A former employee of Qatar’s 2022 World Cup organising committee, jailed on contested corruption charges, faces fresh legal action after his former bosses withheld his severance pay meaning he will default on a loan, his family say. Abdullah Ibhais, a former media manager, was last year given a three-year sentence for misappropriating state funds – a charge that he insists was concocted as punishment for him criticising the handling of a migrant workers’ strike.  Now Ibhais faces the prospect of a new lawsuit, and possibly a further prison sentence, relating to a bank loan that he can no longer service because money owed to him at the end of his employment was not paid. Ibhais and his family claim that withholding funds amounts to applying financial pressure, as he continues to claim his imprisonment stemmed from his views on the treatment of migrant labourers. The case has attracted widespread international attention since Ibhais, a Jordanian national, was found guilty of corruption last August. It has also shone a fresh light on the conditions faced by workers who have built Qatar’s World Cup stadiums over the past six years. Ibhais lost an appeal against his conviction in December and has continued to protest his innocence. A Qatari judge claimed Ibhais received a bribe when offering a tender for a social media contract. However, no evidence was submitted to the court that found him guilty. The evidence supporting his conviction was a confession made by Ibhais, which he has since retracted. Qatari officials deny any political element to the verdict and claim due process was followed in the trial and that more evidence exists that has been tabled in court. Documents obtained by the Dutch newspaper NRC show that the governing body of the 2022 World Cup, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, wrote to Ibhais when he was fired in June 2020 claiming that his termination benefits would be paid. His family told the newspaper that is yet to happen. “They punished him because he did not want to cover up the misery of migrant workers,” said his brother, Ziyad Ibhais. Ten months earlier, Ibhais had been asked to add his weight to the claim that a strike by 5,000 migrant workers over unpaid salaries was not related to World Cup preparations. However, he demurred, and refused mounting pressure throughout the day to make a statement putting distance between organisers and the strike. He was arrested three months later and taken to a criminal investigation headquarters. Despite attempts to overhaul safety and labour conditions for the workforce that has prepared Qatar’s stadiums, human rights organisations say a raft of legislative changes are yet to lead to tangible improvements.Around 90% of Qatar’s population of 2.6 million is made up of foreigners, many of them labourers who have toiled for more than five years, often in blistering heat, to finish the stadiums and supporting infrastructure in time for the World Cup that starts on 21 November.",Sport/Football,Former Qatar 2022 employee facing fresh legal action over loan payments,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/21/former-qatar-2022-employee-facing-fresh-legal-action-over-loan-payments

The interview did, however, refer to one elephant-in-the-room contradiction. Many who would like to vote Labour will disagree with him when he says there is “no case for rejoining” the EU, “we’re out and we’re staying out”, and Brexit must be “made to work from the outside”. Does Starmer not read the opinion polls on Brexit? He says that rather than talking about problems, he identifies what they are and then fixes them. One might have expected that after several years of shadowing Brexit secretaries, he would have identified the inevitable failure of a hopelessly undefined Brexit constrained by Theresa May’s red lines. How does he think he’s going to “fix” this still-open wound which is causing more and more damage to British life and young people’s prospects every day? He cannot and must not be allowed to shrug off the negative impacts of Brexit – as Boris Johnson would like him to. Brexit must be addressed honestly and positively. Labour’s electability is at stake.Graham WebbSaint-Mandé, France   Keir Starmer explicitly rules out rejoining the European single market or customs union, thereby ruling out the most realistic solution to Brexit-related problems with import costs, export barriers, food supplies, energy costs, skills shortages and the Northern Ireland protocol, while also ensuring continued long-term economic damage to the UK. The mood music may vary, but in practice Labour’s rightwing EU policy remains fully aligned with the Tories, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and Ukip (and its successors), as it has been for the last five years.

1/22/2022,"Sam Bowman (The big idea: could fixing housing fix everything else, too?, 17 January) is quite right in pointing out that one social problem – the housing shortage – lies at the root of many other problems, and he provides a pretty full list of what those problems are. As he says, it is not the cost of bricks and mortar that has sky-rocketed, but the cost of land. We face not a housing crisis, but a land crisis. It is clearly wrong that when the state – in the guise of the local planning authority – grants permission for development on an area of land, the enormous increase in its value is largely pocketed as unearned income by the landowner, rather than going to the community whose needs and whose taxes that have paid for local infrastructure give value to land in the first place.  Bowman blames the shortage on the scarcity of permissions to build, but Julia Kollewe (Report, 8 May 2021) told us that since 2010-11, permission for 2.78m houses has been given but only 1.6m have been built in the same period, prompting the suspicion that developers are holding land unused while speculating on further increase in its value, and therefore in their profits. Bowman considers various ways to fix this modern ill, but fails to mention the best one: a revenue-neutral reform of the tax system so that tax is increased on the unearned income from land, ignoring improvements, and reduced on earned income and consumption. Such a land value tax would be levied on unused land as well as other land and so would put a stop to land speculation. There would be a strong incentive to develop, the cost of land and therefore of houses would reduce, leading to real affordability, as well as to solutions of all the problems he identifies as stemming from our housing crisis.Dr Justin RobbinsYealmpton, Devon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

That is not about to happen. Nor, on the rare occasions in which they feature, are their views about to be given equivalence with the science which proves the Earth is spherical. Nonetheless, the BBC’s impartiality does require that we will feature views that not all Guardian readers would approve of and that may, occasionally, not always have scientific proof on their side. And that is not just because people of all views and none pay for the BBC, and audiences should expect their views to be represented – even minimally – somewhere and to some extent. The BBC’s editorial guidelines’ requirement to give “due weight” to opinions will mean that the more extensively views are held the more they should addressed by the BBC.

1/22/2022,"Leaked photographs have confirmed details of a luxurious £1bn palace allegedly built for Vladimir Putin’s personal use, Russian anti-corruption activists have said. The trove of nearly 500 photographs of “Putin’s palace”, published by Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Fund, show that the palatial mansion on Russia’s Black Sea coast has a vast marble swimming pool decorated with busts of Greek gods, a hookah lounge with a pole for dancing, a wine cellar, theatre, and other gaudily decorated amenities.  The photographs also showed that the mansion was decorated with hundreds of gilded double-headed eagles, the symbol of the Russian state. The activists have alleged that the residence was built for Putin’s personal use, a claim that the Russian president has denied. The new photographs appear to refute claims by state media that Navalny’s team invented details of the palace in a blockbuster report last year that included computer-generated renderings of the mansion’s interiors that detractors likened to “cartoons”. While the original report was based on leaked floor plans and contracts for the residence, the new report showed photographs that the Anti-Corruption Fund says were taken during the building’s construction. The Navalny team did not say how they received the photographs. “Surprisingly, Putin is even worse than we expected,” said Georgy Alburov, a researcher for the Anti-Corruption Foundation. “If it seemed to you that we went too far in the film with the interiors, exaggerated and embellished [them], then you were mistaken. Life, as it happens, exceeded any of our expectations.” He compared the residence’s furnishings to the “spirit of Louis XIV”. The original report was published shortly after Navalny was arrested by Russian authorities after returning to the country last January. He was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison on fraud charges that he has said are politically motivated. Putin and other senior government officials refuse to use Navalny’s name in public. The original exposé on the residence showed that the opposition leader remained dangerous to the Kremlin even after his arrest. A video of the investigation became the most popular Russian YouTube video of 2021, earning more than 121m views on the video hosting website.

1/22/2022,"The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has launched a fierce attack on Boris Johnson, claiming “his history is catching up with him” and suggesting the easing of Covid restrictions in England is designed to distract attention from the crisis the prime minister is facing. In sustained criticism of Johnson, Drakeford highlighted that Johnson had twice been sacked from previous jobs for lying and said he believed that everything the Conservative UK government was currently doing was about protecting his position.  Speaking at a press conference in Cardiff, Drakeford, who leads a Labour administration, said: “The prime minister is someone who’s been sacked from two previous jobs for not telling the truth.” He flagged up a newspaper editorial on the eve of the December 2019 election that spelled out Johnson’s flaws, adding: “In many ways, I think what you see is his history catching up with him.” It is believed he was referring to a Sunday Times editorial that said Johnson had an “on-off relationship with the truth” and often preferred “bluster to grasp of detail”. In 2004 Johnson was fired by the then Tory leader, Michael Howard, from positions as shadow arts minister and party vice-chair for lying about an extramarital affair. In the late 1980s, Johnson was sacked by the Times over a front-page article in which he allegedly invented a quote. Drakeford claimed the decision this week to lift coronavirus restrictions in England was about distracting the public’s attention from the scandal engulfing Johnson. “Everything that goes on in Whitehall and Westminster at the moment for the UK government is seen exclusively through the lens of: how does this make a difference to the efforts that are being made to shore up the position of the prime minister? “This is a government that at the moment is simply not capable of doing the ordinary business of government in a competent and sensible way because it is overwhelmed by the headlines that surround dreadful events that went on in Downing Street.” Drakeford said Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron storm and more restrictions such as limits on sporting events have been lifted. The country is due to return to alert level 0 – under which more restrictions are eased – on 28 January as long as the situation continues to improve. The first minister’s attack on Johnson was in turn strongly criticised by the Tories, who accused him of playing politics and trying to distract people from the ongoing restrictions in Wales. The Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said: “These are completely unnecessary and inappropriate comments by the first minister and is further proof that it’s always been about the politics, and not the science, for his Labour administration. “They are a straightforward deflection tactic from a government that has punished Welsh families and businesses with the harshest restrictions in the UK throughout the pandemic.”",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson’s history is catching up with him, says Welsh first minister",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/21/boris-johnson-history-catching-up-welsh-first-minister-drakeford

Dr Matthew Willson, 31, from Chertsey, was shot in the early hours of Friday when a weapon was discharged by a group of individuals from a neighbouring block of flats in the suburb of Brookhaven. No suspects have been arrested.  According to reports, several residents had phoned the emergency services at about 2am and police attended after multiple shots were fired. Willson was believed to have been visiting his girlfriend in Georgia, having flown to the US last week. He was taken to hospital, but died from a gunshot to the head, police said. His death is being investigated as a homicide. It is understood he died after a single bullet passed through the bedroom wall as he slept in bed. Police said they believed the incident was a random act involving individuals participating in the reckless discharge of firearms, local TV reported. Sgt Jacob Kissel from Brookhaven police told WSB-TV: “This was a senseless act – this was an innocent victim. She and her boyfriend were laying in bed. He was here visiting from England. He was visiting a loved one. He had just flown in to the Atlanta area. “We lean on the public to understand that this is a tragic event, and we hope that they may come forward with any information they may have.” Kissel told BBC Radio Surrey that the location of the shooting was “a generally safe area”. He said that officers “immediately responded to the priority call of someone being shot and that’s where they met with a female caller who was rendering aid to her boyfriend who had been shot dead”. He said: “We are asking for our public’s help in assisting us with this investigation.

1/22/2022,"With normality returning, many people are now regretting their lockdown purchases. But the end of home confinement is leaving some wincing at the fanciful, if well-meaning, acquisitions gathering dust in a cupboard. As many wannabe lockdown Leonard Cohens and Laura Marlings have long abandoned their musical ambitions, a new initiative is making sure unwanted instruments find the right home.  Ronnie Scott’s jazz club in Soho, central London, is hosting a musical instrument amnesty this Saturday for celebrities and the public to donate their forlorn flutes, untouched ukuleles and surplus saxophones. All instruments will be serviced before being distributed across the UK and beyond to those less able to receive musical education. Donors will get a tracking number so they can follow their instrument’s journey and see first-hand where in the world it will find its second lease of life. Past amnesties organised by Ronnie Scott’s Charitable Foundation (RSCF) have seen more than 750 instruments and pieces of sound equipment delivered to children and young people in schools across the country and as far afield as South Africa and Uganda. But organisers are expecting the post-pandemic musical disillusionment to lead to a surge in donations this year. “We are expecting turnout this year to be the biggest yet,” said Adaze Ologbosere, head of the RSCF. “If the number of calls we’ve had with people asking how they can donate is anything to go by, we expect the club to be full to the rafters on Saturday.” Instruments collected in the amnesty are increasingly in demand from schools after the government’s plans to halve future funding for music in higher education, a move labelled “catastrophic” by members of the Musicians’ Union and other creatives, industry organisations, higher education institutions and trade unions who have expressed horror at the cuts. It was during lockdown that Shay Levi decided it was time to fulfil her lifelong ambition to play the keyboard. “The second lockdown was pretty much screaming potential and doom all at once,” she said. “I have always wanted to accompany my vocals with piano but never really had the time or motivation to manifest it.” But the fascination didn’t last long. “My motivation began to wane after a few sessions,” she admitted. “I’m definitely more of a hands-on learner but at the time face to face teaching wasn’t even an option.” Gordon Downs had the same musical arc from enthusiasm to ennui. “I took up the guitalele at the beginning of the second lockdown after I found it sitting collecting dust in a local charity shop,” he said. “I’m 70 and wanted to prove that old dogs can learn new tricks but this instrument was too good for me: she’s a beauty and she needs someone with far more experience than I to do her justice.” Rob Folkes, a professional musician who took up the acoustic guitar last January – and put it down for good six months later – said even such a short time playing an instrument was rewarding. “I can’t say I achieved my original goal – I am not currently on a world tour playing a sellout show – but I certainly took something away from it,” he said. “The experience made me remember that there is a lot of joy and pleasure to be found from making music on a new instrument. I hope to do that again in the near future, be that with the guitar or something else.”",Arts/Music,Ronnie Scott’s to host ‘amnesty’ for unwanted lockdown instruments,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/21/ronnie-scotts-to-host-amnesty-for-unwanted-lockdown-instruments
1/22/2022,"NHS waiting lists are out of control. Around 7.5 million people are queueing for hospital treatment in the UK, around 6 million of them in England, where this is the highest number since records began in 2007. In Wales, more than a fifth of the population is waiting for treatment. There are differences in the policies adopted by the devolved administrations to reduce backlogs. In England, it is clear that an increased role for the private sector is the government’s plan. The details of the recovery plan promised by ministers are still being finalised, with NHS bosses resisting what they regard as unrealistic targets. Finding a way to increase surgical capacity, so that more operations can happen more quickly, is the priority. The impact of delays is both social and economic: people waiting for cataracts can’t see properly; people who need joint replacements may struggle to walk. But there are worrying signs that any new contracts will tip the system’s overall balance further in favour of for-profit providers, and away from the NHS.  The unprecedented pressure that the NHS is under ought to lead the government to invest in it, not compel it to rely on businesses to do its work. Yet as with education, where the government chose to buy a package of pandemic catch-up tuition from outside partners rather than funding schools themselves, ministers are opting to meet the additional health needs of the population through the private sector. Earlier this month, Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of NHS England, warned the health secretary, Sajid Javid, that she does not believe the latest three-month deal with private hospitals represents value for public money. She was overruled, with Mr Javid ordering her to accept it despite her warning that the NHS could end up paying for care that is not provided. The role of the private sector in carrying out operations on behalf of NHS England is well established. Labour’s health spokesman, Wes Streeting, has said he would use private firms to reduce waiting lists. Outsourcing also happens in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, although to a lesser extent. But by forcing NHS England to continue to rely on private sector backup, while refusing to commit to long-term workforce planning as advocated by the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, among others, the government is deliberately expanding the role of the market. New research from the Centre for Health and the Public Interest reveals that hundreds of NHS consultants have become shareholders in private ventures. MPs and regulators should examine the financial incentives and potential for conflicts of interests that such arrangements may create, and whether there is a risk of harm to NHS patients. The number of staff absences due to illness has thankfully fallen sharply from the high of 46,000 earlier this month. But if the government sticks to plans to dismiss all those who remain unvaccinated, with letters due to go out next month, the staffing situation in some trusts is expected to get worse. Ministers should consider postponing the deadline, to give a further opportunity for trusts to address vaccine hesitancy in the workforce. Additional NHS funding from higher national insurance should help ease pressures. But the problems in some areas are chronic, long predating the pandemic, and a worsening staffing crisis in the social care sector is already having knock-on effects. Of course, ministers continue to declare their support for the NHS, which they know is valued highly by a public that sees clearly how much worse people fare under for-profit healthcare systems such as in the US. But their actions in beefing up the role of private providers, while refusing to take the steps that would help to secure the NHS’s long-term future, speak louder than their words – or indeed their claps.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on NHS privatisation: the wrong treatment | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/21/the-guardian-view-on-nhs-privatisation-the-wrong-treatment
1/22/2022,"For Mea Walton, the new year began with something akin to disbelief. About to take a flight to LA, she took a PCR test to check for Covid – and it came back positive. But it wasn’t her first infection, or even her second. Walton had tested positive for the fourth time. “I thought, surely, I could never get it again,” she said.  The 20-year-old student nurse in the north-east of England caught her first infection in September 2020, shortly before she left for university. “This was the point where everyone knew someone who knew someone who knew someone who had Covid,” she said. “But no one knew someone that had Covid … It was kind of like, no one believed in it, because everyone was like, ‘Well, I’ve never seen anyone [with it].’” At the time, Walton was working in a pub and wearing a face mask. “I hadn’t left the house other than to go to work because I was working nine hours every day, coming home, getting up, going back to work,” she said. “I started to feel a tiny bit rundown, runny nose, and stuff – but I have allergies anyway. So I assumed it was an allergy.” Walton was persuaded by her mother to take a PCR test. The result was positive. “I just isolated in my room,” she said. At the end of January 2021, both of Walton’s parents caught Covid. She took care to avoid contact, leaving takeaways just inside their front door, but a few days later she had to take a Covid test before starting her nursing placement. The PCR came back positive. The third infection came several weeks later. When a family friend fell very ill with Covid in Brussels in February that year, Walton flew out to help with childcare. On leaving the UK she had a negative lateral flow test. But her return was delayed. “I went to get my PCR to go home and it came back positive,” she said. While Walton didn’t feel unwell for her second and third infections, bar a bit of a runny nose the second time, the fourth infection was different, bringing flu-like symptoms a couple of days after testing positive. Walton, who is double-vaccinated and awaiting her booster, suggested there is an irony to her story. “The funniest thing about it all, really, is every time I’ve had it I’ve never been near a hospital. But all the time I’ve been working with Covid patients I’ve never got it,” she said.",News/World news,The UK student nurse who has caught Covid four times,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/the-uk-student-nurse-who-has-caught-covid-four-times
