2/24/2022,"Kenya’s permanent representative to the United Nations (UN) on Feb. 21 gave a scathing condemnation of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, comparing it to colonialism in Africa. In a statement to the UN Security Council at an emergency meeting to discuss Russia’s decision to recognize the breakaway Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, Martin Kimani said Russia’s move breaches the territorial integrity of Ukraine and pointed out that Africa itself has had to contend with borders created by colonial powers because of the greater goal of peace. What is China’s stand on the Russia-Ukraine conflict? “Kenya, and almost every African country, was birthed by the ending of empire,” he said. “Our borders were not of our own drawing. They were drawn in the distant colonial metropoles of London, Paris, and Lisbon with no regard for the ancient nations that they cleaved apart.” Gabon and Ghana are the other African countries that also spoke out against Moscow’s actions in Ukraine. Martin Kimani, Kenya’s permanent representative to the United Nations. India’s banking loopholes paved the way for a shipbuilder’s $3 billion default Russia and Ukraine are embroiled in a crisis involving Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine’s east. Separatists backed by Russia in the regions broke away from Ukraine in 2014 and the two became self-proclaimed “people’s republics.” Putin claims that eastern Ukraine is ancient Russian land, and on Feb. 21 decided “to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic.” On Feb. 22, Russia ordered ordered “peacekeeping” forces into Donetsk and Luhansk, fuelling fears of war in Europe. Until 1991, Russia and Ukraine were part of the Soviet Union, a socialist state that had spanned Eurasia since 1922. The two countries and 13 others emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Kimani’s colonialism analogy stems from the controversial drawing of African borders by colonial powers. European powers imposed the ideas of states and borders on Africans by creating artificial boundaries based on resources and their other interests and with limited knowledge history and the ethnic composition of the continent. At independence, African states decided to stick with the colonial borders to avoid conflict. There have been disputes and changes since, such as Eritrea separating from Ethiopia in 1993 and South Sudan seceding from Sudan in 2011. But the continent’s borders have largely remained intact. “Rather than form nations that looked ever backward into history with a dangerous nostalgia, we chose to look forward to a greatness none of our many nations and peoples had ever known,” Kimani said. “We chose to follow the rules of the OAU (Organisation of African Unity) and the United Nations charter not because our borders satisfied us but because we wanted something greater forged in peace.” Sign up to the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief here for news and analysis on African business, tech, and innovation in your inbox.

2/24/2022,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A limousine driver testified Wednesday that he was driving Harvey Weinstein around Beverly Hills in 2013 on the night that prosecutors allege that Weinstein raped an actor at a hotel there. The driver, Alfred “Freddy” Baroth, gave conditional testimony in a Los Angeles courtroom that was recorded on video for potential use at the former movie mogul's trial, which has not yet been scheduled. He testified, based on reviewing records at the limousine company that he owns and drives for, that he was driving Weinstein around Beverly Hills late on the night of Feb. 18, where according to a grand jury indictment Weinstein raped and sexually assaulted the woman. The drive said he drove Weinstein back to the hotel where he frequently stayed, the Peninsula Beverly Hills, at the end of the night, around 1 a.m. He said he could not recall if he took Weinstein that night to another Beverly Hills hotel, the Mr. C, where prosecutors allege the rape took place, but that he took Weinstein there about 15 times in the years he drove for him. Baroth also testified to driving Weinstein around the Los Angeles area in 2010, when others of the 11 sexual assault counts against Weinstein in a grand jury indictment are alleged to have happened. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty. Baroth, 74, for years essentially served as the personal chauffeur in California for the New York-based Weinstein. The driver said he had great affection for Weinstein, who treated him well, giving him frequent bonuses for his work, and allowing him to draw hundreds of dollars in cash at will from the front desk at the Peninsula. He said the parting was emotional the last time he saw Weinstein in October 2017, after a raft of women came forward with stories of Weinstein sexually harassing and assaulting them, making him the central figure in the erupting #MeToo movement. “It just came to me that it was very heartfelt, this was the last time I was going to see him,” Baroth said. “I was tipping my hat.” Deputy District Attorney Paul Thompson suggested with his questioning that the cozy relationship was the reason Baroth failed to provide some emails on his business with Weinstein that were under subpoena. Baroth said emails from 2013 came up in his searches, but those from 2010 did not. Asked why not, he replied “I don't know. I'm not an IT guy.” Thompson also pressed Baroth on a $1,000 bonus that he received in 2017 after the allegations arose. “I got bonuses every time Mr. Weinstein came to town because I did such a great job for him,” Baroth said. “Was there talk of a $10,000 bonus from anyone associated with Mr. Weinstein?” Thompson asked. “Yes, from Mr. Weinstein himself,” Baroth answered, The driver said he only received $1,000, his usual bonus. “What happened to the $10,000?” Thompson asked. Baroth replied, “I never received it.” He also said under questioning that Weinstein paid for a lawyer to represent him in the case. Weinstein sat in court Wednesday in a wheelchair, wearing brown jail attire, and listened to the testimony with no visible reaction. He is serving a 23-year sentence in New York after a jury convicted him in February 2020 of a criminal sex act for forcibly performing oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006 and rape in the third degree for an attack on an aspiring actor in 2013. But last month a New York appeals court blasted prosecutors there for using testimony from women whose allegations weren’t part of the criminal charges against him. Several judges on the panel appeared open to considering reversing Weinstein’s conviction and ordering a new trial. No decision has been issued yet. It was not clear why it was necessary for Baroth to testify in advance. The process is usually used for elderly or ailing witnesses who may not be able to testify at trial. The testimony included no talk of the women or any other evidence. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that prosecutors allege that Weinstein raped an actor at the Mr. C hotel, not the Peninsula Beverly Hills.",U.S./Associated Press,Driver: Weinstein in LA area when actor says he raped her,https://news.yahoo.com/driver-weinstein-hotel-where-actor-231048458.html
2/24/2022,"A Republican congressional candidate in Florida was caught on police body camera footage threatening to end an officer’s career because she pulled him over for a traffic stop. Martin Hyde, who is running in Florida’s 16th Congressional District, was pulled over by Sarasota Police Officer Julie Beskin on Feb. 14. In video of the exchange, Beskin advised Hyde he was driving 57 mph in a 40 zone and was also seen texting on his phone. In a combative exchange that followed, he refused to cooperate, threatened her job and asked her if she was behaving that way because she was an immigrant. “I’ll just call your chief. How’s that? You know who I am, right?” Hyde asked her after she explained why she’d stopped him. “Go right ahead, sir,” Beskin replied. “Yes, sir, I do.” She then asked him for his license and registration, telling him she was just doing her job. “Yeah, for now,” he replied. When Beskin returned to Hyde’s vehicle with a citation, he told her he’d called her supervisor. “I just spoke to your boss,” he said. “Is it your Russian immigrant status that makes you treat people like this?” Hyde then refused to take his paperwork from the officer, so she placed it on his dashboard. ″Don’t put your hand in my car. You don’t have a warrant,” he told her. Hyde posted a statement on Facebook Tuesday apologizing over the incident and admitting he was “belligerent and rude to the officer.” He also admitted to being aggressive when challenged, arguing that it could be a good trait for a politician. “I;m [sic] not going to justify my poor temper on that day or attempt to mitigate it in any way,” he wrote. ”There will be some who will say it’s not the first time I’ve acted out and they’d be right. I have faults and one of them is to be overly aggressive on occasion when I’m challenged.” “In the political arena that is possibly a good thing but on a personal level it’s not,” he added. He said he’d apologized to Beskin and was also apologizing to the community, pledging to “do my utmost to behave better going forward.” Hyde is challenging Rep. Vern Buchanan in the GOP primary. He’s been endorsed by political operative Roger Stone and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, both of whom received pardons from former President Donald Trump in criminal cases. According to his campaign website, Hyde was a former professional soccer player in the UK and a business owner in Sarasota. His key issues are listed as putting “America First,” protecting the Second Amendment, enacting term limits for elected leaders and fighting “cancel culture.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.
