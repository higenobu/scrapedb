1/16/2022,"You don’t need to be Sigmund Freud to understand that ornaments can become symbols of emotion. But now research into a curious decorative object that Freud himself once cherished has shed fresh light on the darker corners of his own psyche. A tiny Chinese screen, made of jade and placed in the centre of his consulting desk, was one of only two items salvaged from his former apartment in Vienna in 1938. The intricate ornament, which still stands in position in his last home in Hampstead, north London, is not particularly valuable and had no obvious connection to the life of the founding father of psychoanalysis. Yet it was deliberately smuggled out of his apartment by a close friend when the Nazis threatened to confiscate the large collection of artefacts and antiques Freud had left behind in Austria. The significance of the jade screen has puzzled historians of his work ever since.  Now, curators of an exhibition that opens next month inside his London house are to present the screen as the key to unlocking Freud’s fascination with China in the last years of his life. Made from pierced jade and wood, it was designed for a scholar’s desk and depicts the Chinese character of “shou”, meaning “long life”. To a Daoist mind, the accompanying flower decoration was an aid to the contemplation of the simplicity of the natural world. Yet for Freud it held another significance. “Freud seems to have used the screen as a reminder of the unknown,” said curator Professor Craig Clunas, an expert on Chinese culture. “For him, the Orient was like the dark area of hidden significance in the human mind. There is also a strong argument that he associated it with the psychology of women, something he regarded as a shifting and mysterious thing.” The jade screen was directly in front of Freud as he worked and consulted with patients and Clunas believes it represented all that Freud felt his theories could not explain. At that time the shadowy world of an imagined “Orient” to the east was widely set in contrast to the western tradition of logical thought and classical culture. So, while Freud studied both Greek and Roman philosophy in depth, Clunas notes that he avoided serious research into Chinese customs and schools of thinking. Instead, Freud used Chinese artefacts as potent emblems of mystery. “Freud’s little understood interest in China is something that came to him in his last decade, so it was very fresh in his mind at the end,” said Clunas, a professor emeritus of the history of art at the University of Oxford, where he was a specialist in China until 2018. “Before then, Freud had collected other things, especially items from the classical world. He was usually a voracious reader, but it seems as if he chose to leave China as an area of the unknown.” Freud came to London as a refugee with his adult daughter Anna, the pioneering child psychoanalyst, when they escaped the Nazi annexation of Austria in March 1938. The pair set up house together in Maresfield Gardens, Hampstead, where Freud saw patients in the study that would also be the scene of his death from cancer a year later. Freud and China, the exhibition opening on 12 February at the Freud Museum, will be the first to look at this element of Freud’s life and to examine the Chinese objects he began to collect, often positioning them in the eyeline of his patients as they lay on his famous couch. “The beautiful little jade ornament was clearly treasured by Freud and a significant object for him. Our exhibition will attempt to work out why,” said Carol Seigel, director of the Freud Museum. As the second world war approached, Freud had been forced to select a couple of objects to be brought to England from Vienna, asking his well-connected friend Marie Bonaparte to take them secretly from his apartment. “She put the jade screen and a small Greek bronze inside her handbag so they would not be spotted by the stormtroopers waiting outside,” said Clunas. “The bronze dates from the beginning of Freud’s collecting career and the screen from his new interest in China. Maybe this is why they were both chosen.” Freud used the Chinese language as an analogy in his influential writing on interpreting dreams, but as Clunas points out, this was based on a common misunderstanding. “He picked up on the idea that the Chinese language system has a certain vagueness and relies on context for meaning. “This is not quite right and later the Chinese interpreter of his autobiography queried the suggestion and asked where Freud had sourced it. He said he had taken it from the Encyclopaedia Britannica.” Freud’s enthusiasm for collecting artefacts followed the death of his father and academics have seen this as an emotional reaction to mourning. His later interest in China followed his mother’s death and so, at one level, it does seem to be attached to gender, suggests Clunas. The psychoanalyst also had a fondness for chows, dogs linked with China in the western imagination. Jofi, his favourite, was by Freud’s side while he saw patients and Freud’s dog Lun was brought with the family to London after they left Vienna. Lun’s release after six months of quarantine was celebrated across the British media.",Arts/Books,How a jade ornament from China casts new light on Freud’s psyche,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/16/how-a-jade-ornament-from-china-casts-new-light-on-freuds-psyche
1/16/2022,"When the country was in lockdown in late March 2020 and members of parliament had returned to their constituencies for an early Easter recess, the then business minister Nadhim Zahawi set out the rules for businesses around the country to fight the pandemic. He urged them to help prevent the spread of disease by avoiding unnecessary mixing. “Workers should try to minimise all meetings and gatherings in the workplace,” he said in a written parliamentary answer.  Across the country, businesses, charities and public organisations heeded the message. It now appears there was one address that was a notable exception to these guidelines: No 10 Downing Street. From the national lockdown announced by Boris Johnson on 23 March 2020 until April last year, there were at least 14 parties, leaving dos, quizzes and meetings-with-drinks at Downing Street, as well as other Whitehall offices. “It was ‘party on’ and nobody was saying ‘don’t do this’,” said Lord Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, last week. “Once it started, it just got worse and worse. There was a lack of moral awareness. “It’s an appallingly undisciplined, irresponsible and tone-deaf behaviour which showed a complete lack of empathy for the way in which the country was having to suffer from lockdown at the time.” It was alleged last week that one of the events last May spilled into the garden in the late hours and a reveller broke a child’s swing belonging to Wilf Johnson, the prime minister’s son. It is also claimed a suitcase was used on at least one occasion for a supermarket run to stock up on alcohol, and a £142 drinks fridge was installed in the ground-floor press office for “wine-time Fridays”. The “partygate” scandal is vying to be the biggest political mess of Johnson’s career. Sue Gray, the second permanent secretary at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, who was the head of propriety and ethics in the Cabinet Office for six years, has the unenviable task of unpicking it. She has a reputation for being fair, independent and tough-minded, but there is a growing consensus that her inquiry is no longer fit for purpose. Kerslake said: “When the inquiry started, it was about one event and we didn’t know that the prime minister was involved. Now we find that there were over a dozen events and not only is the prime minister implicated but he is front, back and centre of what happened. “You cannot have a situation where a civil servant will make a pronouncement that could end the office of a prime minister. The consequence is that Sue Gray will inevitably have to stop short of that.” Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair’s former chief of staff, who served in Downing Street for a decade, said Gray would set out the facts and the matter would be decided in the “court of public opinion”. He said Downing Street was spinning the report as a “get out of jail” card because officials were confident there would be no finding of the prime minister breaching lockdown laws, since the matter was not in the inquiry’s remit. Powell said he had high regard for Gray, but it was “totally inappropriate” for the inquiry to be conducted by a civil servant reporting to the prime minister. He said it would be “career-shortening” for her to deliver a judgment that the prime minister had potentially broken the law or breached the ministerial code and it would be better to have an independent non-judicial inquiry conducted in the space of a few weeks. Powell also said Johnson’s staff appeared to have held more staff parties in a period of months than Blair’s team had held in a decade. “It’s pretty extraordinary,” he said. “I don’t know what time was left for work.” He said his experience of Downing Street was that it had been extremely difficult to take in any food or drink without exhaustive checks by the police. He said: “I am amazed they could send someone out and come back with a suitcase full of booze. Imagine putting that through the scanner.” Jolyon Maugham, director of the Good Law Project, a non-profit organisation that campaigns on legal issues, said the investigation into the parties should now be led by the police. He said: “The key question is whether the prime minister, civil servants or special advisers have committed a criminal offence. This inquiry by Sue Gray is not asked to answer that question. The whole thing feels like a smokescreen for what should be happening – an investigation by the Metropolitan police.” Under the terms of reference of Gray’s inquiry, if any evidence is found that potentially involves a criminal offence, it will be passed to the police. If that happened, the government investigation might be put on hold. The Metropolitan police said on Saturday that it has “ongoing contact” with the Cabinet Office in relation to the inquiry, but would not comment on whether it had received any material involving potential offences. Adam Wagner, a barrister and expert in Covid law, said Gray had a conflict of interest because she was investigating more senior figures in government. “It is clearly compromised,” he said. “It wouldn’t pass muster as an independent investigation in any legal setting.”",News/Politics,Concerns grow that scale of ‘partygate’ is now too great for Sue Gray’s inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/16/concerns-grow-that-scale-of-partygate-is-now-too-great-for-sue-grays-inquiry
1/16/2022,"Two years ago, Qi Jiayao visited his mother’s hometown of Shaoxing in eastern China. When he tried to speak to his cousin’s children in the local dialect, Qi was surprised. “None of them was able to,” recalls the 38-year-old linguist, who now teaches Mandarin in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. The decline in local dialects among the younger generation has become more apparent in recent years as China’s president, Xi Jinping, has sought to strengthen a uniform Chinese identity. Mandarin is now being spoken by more than 80% of China’s population, up from 70% a decade ago. Last month, China’s state council vowed to increase the figure to 85% within the next four years.  But the popularisation of a standard national language is often at the expense of regional languages, including dialects of the Han majority and ethnic languages such as Mongolian and Uyghur. In Inner Mongolia, for example, local regulations in 2016 allowed ethnic schools to use their own language for teaching. This policy was aimed at developing students’ linguistic skills and cultivating bilingualism. But four years later it was reversed to favour Mandarin, a move that sparked protests from the ethnic population. It is not just ethnic languages that are being affected. In 2017, a survey circulated online showed that among the 10 dialect groups, Wu Chinese, which includes the Shanghai dialect and is spoken by about 80 million people in the eastern part of the country, has the smallest number of active users aged between six and 20. It prompted concern among linguists in the region. In Shanghai, where Qi grew up, activists have campaigned to encourage use of their dialect for many years. In 2020, a local political representative urged the Shanghai government to invest in promoting the local dialect. The government responded by upgrading the local Huju opera annual festival to a municipality-level activity. This success encouraged Qi. But he is realistic about how much activists can accomplish. In 2014, the TV programme Shanghai Dialect Talk on Shanghai Doco TV was taken off air after the government insisted on the use of standard Mandarin for the channel to be broadcast nationally. Chinese laws prevent satellite TV channels from broadcasting in local dialects. Activists are turning to social media and local events. A new group of volunteers has been making a recording of Blossoms, by Jin Yucheng, winner of the prestigious Mao Dun literature prize and one of the few novels written in the Shanghainese dialect of Wu. Every few weeks, the organisers upload chapters to WeChat and Himalaya, a Chinese podcast site. Qi is now compiling a Shanghai dialect dictionary. In 2000, China passed laws to standardise spoken and written language. In each province, a language committee advises, monitors and polices the use of Mandarin. The strength of the implementation varies, but it is not difficult for a determined government to enforce its policy. In September, the south-western province of Sichuan banned civil servants and party cadres from using the local dialect in the workplace, a language once used on national TV by Deng Xiaoping, the former supreme leader, before his death in 1997. “The state has been telling people there are visible and tangible benefits from speaking standard Mandarin Chinese,” says Fang Xu, an urban sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of Silencing Shanghai: Language and Identity in Urban China. “Since then, many regional languages – including Shanghainese – have suffered the same fate.” A 2010 study by Beijing Union University found that nearly half of local Beijing residents born after 1980 prefer using Mandarin Chinese over the Beijing dialect. But it is not all bad news, she adds. In the past, internal migrants from outside Shanghai often felt discriminated against and excluded by being unable to speak the local dialect. Today social exclusion no longer hinges on speech or residential status but wealth. “The richest in Shanghai today are not even Shanghainese.” Qi began noticing the change when studying in the north-eastern city of Harbin in 2002. “Looking from a local Shanghai perspective, the marginalisation of the dialect is alarming. But thinking nationally, it may be inevitable at a time when a uniform Chinese identity trumps everything,” he says. “The diminishing of dialects seems only to be the price we pay for it.”",News/World news,Chinese dialects in decline as government enforces Mandarin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/chinese-dialects-in-decline-as-government-enforces-mandarin
1/16/2022,"Perhaps bravely, the BBC is making a drama series about Jimmy Savile, exploring how its former favourite managed a double life as a star and paedophile, dying before being unmasked in an ITV documentary. Savile’s victims have, it’s reported, been involved in a production likely to show how his extraordinary status, giving him opportunities for years of attacks, derived from a doting state broadcaster. The series will inevitably remind audiences how BBC executives subsequently suppressed their journalists’ attempts to expose his crimes.  Given this historical but probably indelible association with one of the UK’s most infamous paedophiles, it’s unfortunate the corporation’s flagship building should still double as a monument to another notorious British pervert, Eric Gill. Last week, Gill’s most famous public sculpture, Prospero and Ariel, was badly vandalised in front of an audience including various police officers and spectators from the BBC. In hindsight, the BBC may be wondering if it could have done more to protect a sculpture that is so public, so accessible and so controversial. Maybe by using protective wire, like Cecil Rhodes at Oriel College, with a similarly contextualising, Oliver Dowden-mollifying plaque. “Retain and explain”, according to the former culture secretary, is the correct way to reconcile a statue’s critics with the object of their understandable revulsion. Although it’s hard to see, as with the Edward Colston statue, what inscription would answer here. Gill’s work ornaments a key national building. What, in his case, justifies continued public display of a piece whose revised but still monumental message is “made by a famous child abuser”? As for the “leftwing snowflakes” who, according to Dowden’s successor, Nadine Dorries, enjoy “tearing down statues”, does that define everyone who recoils from Gill’s behaviour and, along with it, his work? Like the nude studies of the daughters he was raping? To complicate matters, the way Gill harmed these children belongs, thankfully, to no tradition sacred to earlier generations, not in 1933, not in 1633 or 1033. After last week’s distressing but not wholly surprising attack, the BBC informed the public that Shakespeare’s Ariel “as the spirit of the air, was seen as an appropriate symbol for the new dawn of broadcasting”. Supposing this notion ever really worked – the novelist Penelope Fitzgerald pointed out that Ariel was a liar, “pretending that someone’s father had died full fathom five, when in point of fact he was safe and well” – metaphorical difficulties seem unlikely to have provoked the vandalism. Though it’s a reminder that Two Little Boys was once a sweet song loved by Margaret Thatcher. “The BBC,” the statement continued, “doesn’t condone the views or actions of Eric Gill. Clearly there are debates about whether you can separate the work of an artist from the art itself. We think the right thing to do is for people to have those discussions. We don’t think the right approach is to damage the artwork itself.” But who thinks the BBC does condone Gill’s offences or that damaging his artwork is a great idea? There’s no response, however, to a reasonable proposal that it be moved, given that survivors have called its current prominence an insult, mocking, “intolerable”. With the further difficulty, in this specific case, of separating the artist from the art being elevated. At least one art critic has reported feeling “aesthetic revulsion” from Gill’s sculptures, including Prospero and Ariel. It was carved in 1932, with Gill adding to a Tempest theme he seems never to have grasped some godly content of his own. For Gill, religion and sex were indivisible (“we are fucked by Christ, and bear children to him”). Both the sculptor and the statues created a stir, in relation to Ariel’s penis size, but nothing approaching the reaction when, in 1989, his biographer, the late Fiona MacCarthy, disclosed that the pious Gill was a child abuser. There were diary entries, previously ignored, in which Gill recorded furtive sexual encounters with two of his daughters, as well as with his dog. Though women of all ages were targeted the married Gill, a superficially droll figure in his monk’s habit and “girdle of chastity”. And some criticisms of his Ariel were probably not, it emerged, vexatious. Gill liked causing trouble. He was also, MacCarthy found, phallically obsessed. His own dimensions were scrupulously recorded, sometimes with female assistance. In one tract, Trousers & the Most Precious Ornament, the saintly penis liberator rails against modern containment: “All sidewise, dishonoured, neglected, ridiculed and ridiculous – no longer the virile member.” Gill was certainly blessed in both his biographer, since MacCarthy did not allow his “strange urge for the sordid” to qualify her appreciation of his work, and in the timing of these revelations, not long before Savile was knighted. Being inflicted long before survivors began to be heard on what had been done to them by priests, by teachers and inside children’s homes, and before the evidence of Savile, Gary Glitter and Rolf Harris, Gill’s initial reputational damage was strikingly limited. Even 10 years later, a Guardian obituary of one of Gill’s daughters could depict the incestuous rapes, since these could hardly be ignored, as paternal encouragement: “He introduced Betty and Petra to the mysteries of sex and recorded the occasions in his diaries.” Gill apologists liked to stress that neither girl had publicly complained of abuse. But their father, keeping it secret, was in no doubt. “This must stop,” he wrote. Outside the BBC, Gill’s abuse is finally catching up with his artistic legacy. Save the Children is going to stop using his typeface Gill sans. The Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft, in which Gill’s work is central, is committed to showing his work without separating it from his abuse. A still greater sensitivity, given the feelings of survivors about its far more prominent collection, might have been expected from the BBC. Instead, in an uncanny echo of Savile, it seems again to be struggling with plain sight.

1/16/2022,"Forget Annabel’s – the place to be for the professional “partygoer” is Downing Street, especially during a pandemic. But it is invitation-only for the “in crowd” of government advisers, civil servants and elected politicians prepared to bring their own booze. With every revelation, the nation recalls what it was doing on those nights that were filled with dancing for the Downing Street set. As people isolated, courageously risked their lives caring for the sick, or died from Covid-19, the revellers remained in their alternative universe where the wine flowed and the music played on.  In May 2020, as Boris Johnson and his wife attended a “work event” where people were invited to bring alcohol, I was using alcohol of another kind. On my hands. They were raw, blistered and painful, but at least alcohol gel sterilises hands in between the constant flow of patients. Then there was my mask, which cut ridges so deep into my face they became sores. I recall the weather being good, as is mentioned in the Downing Street emails. I was sweating from the heat in full PPE in a contamination suite in the north Wales hospital where I worked, so hot I thought I was going to pass out. By this time, some colleagues had already lost their lives. Homerton hospital consultant urologist Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, aged only 53, died after pleading for PPE and then contracting Covid when it was not supplied appropriately. I spoke to his son, Intisar, then 18, when his grief was still raw. He could not comprehend back then the injustice. What will he make of it now? We had no vaccines at that point. PPE rules changed on a weekly basis relating to supply, not evidence. It was akin to going into war without a bulletproof vest. In April 2020, Johnson became unwell with Covid and required critical care. That same month, I caught Covid from my brother, also a doctor. He is immunocompromised from a health condition, but was sent to look after Covid patients without proper PPE, despite his health risks. I spent a terrifying month caring for him. As an ITU doctor at the time, he proned himself – lying on his front when oxygen levels dipped to try to oxygenate the base of his lungs. That experience cemented in me the importance of sticking to the emerging Covid advice. Yet the prime minister went in the opposite direction. Now we hear of a suitcase of alcohol smuggled into No 10 for a leaving party on the eve of the funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh, where the Queen would sit, mourning alone according to the Covid rules. These revelations set the scene for a government of diminished responsibility for people relying on it for safety. The Downing Street Christmas party coincided with the day my father was admitted to hospital with Covid, unable to breathe. He died a few days after the Downing Street revellers opened their secret Santa gifts.

1/16/2022,"After another dreadful week for Boris Johnson that was dominated by news of yet more rule-breaking parties at No 10, the comedian Andy Zaltzman opened BBC Radio 4’s News Quiz at 6.30pm on Friday by announcing his two teams. One he named “team apologise” and the other “team pack of lies”. Zaltzman added: “This show is best listened to when not at work. If you are unsure whether you are at work or not at work, please check whether anyone you normally work with has turned up with a bottle of wine and is getting hammered.”  What followed was 20 minutes of relentless ridicule of the prime minister for attempting to pass off a lockdown-busting bring-your-own-booze gathering for dozens of people in the garden of No 10 in May 2020 (which he attended with his wife), as a work event. Half an hour later, over on the Sky Sports’s Friday Night Football show, the pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher were also getting in on the act. Asked about the rivalry between Brighton and Hove Albion and Crystal Palace, who were about to face each other on the pitch, Neville replied with a straight face that such derby games often seemed like a “massive party”. His somewhat awkward – though clearly prepared – allusion to political events in answer to a question about football allowed Carragher to carry on the gag. “This is not a party tonight. This is about work,” he said. “They’ve got to know the difference between work and a party,” he said. Across the media Johnson, the politician who used to make the jokes on shows like Have I Got News for You, has become a national laughing stock, and everyone is at it. Johnson’s descent is a story with mass appeal. The popular ITV show This Morning, which normally steers well clear of politics, cut straight to prime minister’s questions live on Wednesday to hear Johnson’s apology-cum-justification for attending the May 2020 party himself, such was the level of interest. The dizzying speed of the revelations, denials, admissions and apologies has left Tory MPs struggling to keep up. By Thursday evening many were already dreading returning to their constituencies. They knew that “partygate” was damaging because Johnson had lost respect. But they were also aware that it was much more serious than that for every Conservative: the stories about rule-breaking get-togethers had caused deep anger and – to thousands who had lost relatives or friends to Covid-19 – intense anguish and pain. The mix was, potentially, politically lethal for the entire Conservative party. To their horror, however, there was even worse to come that evening. A report would surface in the Daily Telegraph saying that No 10 staff had also held two bashes in Downing Street, lasting into the early hours, the night before Prince Philip’s funeral last April. “When I heard that I thought when does it end? Does it ever?” said one former Conservative minister. “Just when you thought the latest awful episode might be behind us we are back on the same routine of trying to hide the truth.” When they had to confront their constituents and their inboxes on Friday, Conservative MPs were shaken by the backlash. “The fact that they had parties before the royal funeral was what really set a lot of people off,” said one southern Tory MP. “That is when my emails really flooded in. Many were from people I don’t normally hear from. One of my colleagues said he had 500 emails overnight and most were from constituents he had not heard from until now.” Another Tory, from a northern seat, said his local councillors, who had been Johnson supporters, had summoned him to a meeting on Friday to express their disgust. The Tory councillors had voted for Johnson to be leader and had voted for Brexit. But they had turned against him. “I can accurately say my councillors are very pissed off,” he said. “They had been confident before all of this that we would hold our local councils in the May local elections. Now they think we will lose because of his behaviour. They want Boris out. They are furious.” Peter Aldous, Tory MP for Waveney in Suffolk, many of whose constituents had been loyal Johnson and Brexit supporters, said the feedback from his constituents was “very largely very negative”. Where 10 days before Aldous had been ready to give Johnson another chance, he was now close to concluding that he should go. He would wait until the publication of a report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray before finally deciding. “As matters stand at the moment my view is that it would be best if he stood down, but I think we should wait for the report. An awful lot of people who voted Brexit do feel very badly let down.” Another Tory MP said that if working-class Brexit supporters – who had largely stayed loyal to Johnson over recent months – were now deserting, the PM was in real trouble. “Quite of few of my colleagues still take the view that Boris won us the election and delivered Brexit so they say we should stay loyal. But if that coalition cracks among 2019 voters, those MPs could start to crack too.” This weekend most Tory MPs and many Conservative ministers say they, too, will wait for the Gray report before they decide whether to call for Johnson to go. So far only a handful of backbenchers have done so. But privately many admit they are holding off more because they believe they have to be seen to be observing “due process” than because they believe he should continue at No 10. “I think we do have to wait for the process to run its course, but I am clear he should go,” said one former minister. Gray, a former head of ethics in the civil service who was appointed by Johnson to establish the facts about the Downing Street parties, is expected to conclude her report and publish it towards the end of next week. While her job is to establish what happened and not to suggest punishment or remedies for individuals, the word in Whitehall is that she will not hold back in her judgments. One source who knows Gray well and has been in regular contact with her over recent days says suggestions that she will preside over any form of whitewash will prove wide of the mark. Rather, he expects her to make it clear that things went very wrong in No 10, that the government’s own Covid guidance was not adhered to, and that those responsible must take the blame. Gray, the source said, was dismayed last week at hearing of more parties – ones that she not been informed of but had heard of via the media. “She has very high standards. She is ruthless. She is disappointed in what she is finding but personally she is robust,” the source said. “She will give it both barrels to whoever deserves it, whether that is a special adviser or civil servant or the politicos. We will get the unvarnished truth. If she sees direct responsibility, she will be clear. That is why I think this is going to be uncomfortable for everyone. Everyone is going to take their share of the blame.” He added: “My sense is that there won’t be one killer moment with a video of the prime minister dancing or whatever. It will be more about what a shitshow that whole operation is and what it has led to, how they felt that they could do this sort of stuff when they were running the country.” There are worries among backbenchers, however, that the period immediately after Gray publishes will be messy and protracted, and that Johnson and No 10 will try to spin anything short of a conclusion of law-breaking, as a triumph. The Tory MP and former health minister Dr Dan Poulter said that, with this in mind, he would like Gray to refer the results of her inquiry on to an independent authority which could advise on what action should be taken. “We are in the extremely unusual situation where the prime minister is both under investigation and the arbitrator of that same investigation,” he said. “The prime minister would be poorly served in judging the final report himself, as it is very important for him and the high office he holds that the outcome of this process has credibility and cannot be brought into question. “It would be better for Sue Gray to hand the completed investigation to either Lord Geidt or a panel of senior constitutional judges to allow them to pass judgement and make appropriate recommendations.” But there is another school of thought developing both in the Tory party and in Whitehall, which is that it might all be over for Johnson before he even gets to see the Gray report: that events could spiral out of control for him very fast, perhaps within days. The way the leader of the Scottish Tories, Douglas Ross, called for Johnson to go last week, and was backed by Tory MSPs – only for cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg to dismiss Ross as a “lightweight” – has triggered doubts about whether the party can hang together for much longer, with ministers straining to defend Johnson, and attracting more ridicule in the process. “You cannot have this in a unionist party,” said a senior Tory adviser. “What is Rees-Mogg doing for the sake of trying to save Boris Johnson? It is complete farce.” Government is paralysed and the cracks are widening. Every movement of Chancellor Rishi Sunak, the favourite to succeed Johnson, and foreign secretary Liz Truss are being picked over for what they reveal about their leadership ambitions. Today’s Opinium poll for the Observer is devastating for Johnson and the Tories. The least surprising finding is that Labour is now 10 points ahead of the Conservatives, having enjoyed comfortable leads just three months ago. More striking is that Johnson’s personal ratings have nosedived to levels equivalent to those of Theresa May at her lowest point. Just 22% of people approve of the job Johnson is doing as prime minister. And 48% of Conservative voters at the 2019 election now say he should resign. Nor can he rely on Brexit supporters – 46% of Tory Leave voters say he should quit. Sonia Khan, a former Tory special adviser said: “For many Conservative MPs, the risk of ‘partygate’ has only felt real this week. MPs tell me they’ve had emails in their hundreds from voters in the most marginal parts of their constituencies telling them they will never vote Conservative again. “Worryingly, these are voters who leant their vote to the Conservatives in 2019 and hoped to see a ‘levelled-up’ country. These are voters who make up the blue wall and are critical the success in seats in the Midlands, the south of England and more. “Without these votes, no one can see how they hold on to their seats and secure another electoral victory in a general election. For the first time since the election, they see the risk that comes with these stories and the current prime minister. They saw the falling poll ratings but never saw what that meant for them directly and it’s this insecurity that will drive them to find a successor to Johnson.” Another former adviser to a Tory cabinet minister said he believed the script was already written and it would not end well for Boris Johnson. “They can talk about waiting for Sue Gray and they may do. But it is like watching one of those nature programmes where the animal is trapped and we know how it ends.

1/16/2022,"The copper-coloured afternoon light turns a deep blue as it streams through the stained-glass windows of All Saints’ church in Tudeley, near Tonbridge, Kent. Visitors come from all over the world to see these colours falling to the floor because All Saints’ is the only church in the world where all the windows are by the modernist artist Marc Chagall. But those heavy, aquatic blues sliced through by white figures could soon shine a little less if a new nearby “garden village” – a mile-long estate of 6,500 houses – gets the go-ahead. “I’m devastated. I’m appalled,” says campaigner Dave Lovell as he stands outside the church door and looks across the unspoilt countryside where the Tunbridge Wells garden village is proposed. “It’s a beautiful part of the countryside and to lose this historic landscape is a tragedy.”  Tudeley is far from alone. A series of garden villages and towns – and one “garden city” at Ebbsfleet – is being planned on greenfield sites and protected areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONB) across Kent. In a county known as the garden of England, this has caused uproar. Garden developments attract special funding from the government so developers often attach the label to projects. But Lovell, a former officer with the National Crime Agency who lives in the nearby village of Capel, dismisses the bucolic moniker. “There’s nothing organic about them,” he says. “They’re artificial and imposed on us. And I’m not sure how they can evolve a sense of community.” There are at least seven more garden developments planned, including Otterpool Park near Folkestone, which will have 10,000 homes, Highstead Park near Sittingbourne which will have 9,250, five schools and a health centre, and Borough Green near Tonbridge, which will have 3,000 homes built on green belt land and an AONB. Planning authorities say their hands are being forced by the government’s target of building 300,000 homes a year. The Tunbridge Wells project is split into three parts and Lovell’s village of Capel will be subsumed by the largest section. “There are 950 houses in the parish at the moment and that will be swallowed up by nearly 5,000,” he says. “Local life will completely change. It’s really an existential threat.” Protest groups have sprung up across the county. Lovell’s idea was to bring them together under an umbrella group: Save Kent’s Green Spaces, which organised a “day of action” on 28 November last year, when the activists marched and rallied. “As far as we can see, there’s no official count on how much land is even being lost,” says Lovell. “We have an estimate but it’s only based on what the 30-odd campaign groups that became involved in the day of action have told us, and what we’ve picked up through newspaper reports. So we’re looking at over 18,000 acres at the moment.” He says they estimate 7.5 houses per acre, though some of that will go on schools and other social infrastructure. Like much of Britain, Kent has a shortage of housing and social housing. In Tunbridge Wells there were 897 families on the waiting list in 2021. According to Paul Cheshire, professor of economic geography at the LSE, “It’s almost impossible to provide land for new homes [around Tunbridge Wells] without releasing some green belt land. So much of the area is either green belt or AONB.” There are 17 MPs in Kent – 16 Conservative and Labour’s Rosie Duffield in Canterbury. And there is nothing like housing developments on greenfield sites to provoke a backlash from Tory heartland voters. In last June’s Chesham and Amersham byelection, for instance, the Liberal Democrats overturned a 16,000 majority in a Buckinghamshire seat that has always voted Conservative, with a 25.2% swing, largely on the back of local opposition to HS2 and housing development. With an identical swing, all 16 of Kent’s Tory MPs would be looking for new jobs. Tom Tugendhat, Tory MP for Tonbridge and Malling, says that developments such as Tunbridge Wells garden village undermine some of the most important policies of the government. “Of course we need new homes for young people in our community and to give people somewhere for their families,” he says. “But the government’s climate change commitments make some of these decisions pretty strange. We can’t go around bulldozing fields when we need to maintain our green spaces to meet our climate commitments.” Local protests against the garden villages have made some strange bedfellows. In Faversham, for example, those addressing the marches against the developments on the day of action included local resident Bob Geldof from one end of the political spectrum, and the local Tory MPs Helen Whately and Rehman Chishti from the other. Geldof, who lives in the 12th-century Davington Priory on the edge of the town, told the rally: “I have lived in Kent for 40-odd years and to see what amounts to a full-scale attack on the county and its people by the central government planners gives a lie to … Boris Johnson’s promise that they would not build on green fields.” Vicky Castle, content editor for news site Kent Live, says the issue is turning previously quiescent people into activists. “These are angry, knowledgeable people and they’re quite loud,” she explains. “The local Tory MPs are saying, ‘We don’t want this’. And central government turns around and says, ‘Tough, you’re having it’.” “It’s radicalising local people because they care about these things. You drive around the county for one day and it looks completely different to how it did five years ago. People notice that and they’re worried.” Duffield wants a new approach. “It’s really disappointing because it’s so unimaginative,” she says. “There are brownfield sites, there are loads of other places. It seems like a developer just has their eye on a lovely area of land. And we’re not going to get it back if it’s full of houses.” An hour’s drive across Kent from All Saints’ church to Faversham, and the light has faded, turning a field of winter-bare blackberry bushes into dark fingers. They lie on farmland owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, Prince Charles’s business empire, but the duchy has applied for planning permission to build 2,500 homes on 320 acres of countryside. A duchy spokesman said: “Swale council identified the Duchy of Cornwall’s land as a highly sustainable location for an urban extension of the town, providing 2,500 homes and around 2,500 jobs. Since the initial allocation, the duchy has been engaging with the Faversham community to help shape a vision for a mixed use community that meets local housing needs. “The plan is being designed from the ground up to improve soils, increase biodiversity, and achieve water neutrality on site with its own waste water treatment plant.” As evening birds chatter, Carol Goatham walks beside the silhouetted fruit bushes and points out a line of yellow markers that show the path of proposed gas lines to the houses that will replace them. “The pears for the Queen’s wedding breakfast came from this farm,” says Goatham, a retired occupational therapist who founded a group to oppose the development. “And my father worked here when I was young. We are only self-sufficient for 16% of the fruit we eat in this country and this is the highest grade of agricultural land. If we lose these fields, we lose food security. “I’ve always been a royalist and I’m really pleased about Prince Charles’s green credentials but now I feel that if he sanctions this, then … ” She shakes her head. She looks from the lines of skeletal blackberry bushes to rows of spring greens pushing through the soil nearby. That soil will also soon be covered if the duchy’s application is granted. “We’re only a small rural town and they’re going to obliterate our beautiful green fields,” she says. “Kent’s supposed to be the Garden of England and we’re going to become a concrete county.” A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: “Making the most of previously developed land is a government priority to protect our cherished countryside. Councils are ultimately responsible for setting housing targets in their area.”",News/Society,Uproar in garden of England at homes plan that could ‘swallow up’ villages,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/16/uproar-in-the-garden-of-england-at-homes-plan-that-could-swallow-up-villages
1/16/2022,"1. Johnson out within days Support for Johnson continues to haemorrhage away over the next 24 to 48 hours. Tory MPs despair as their party nosedives further in the polls and constituents flood their inboxes with furious emails. Tory councillors panic, fearing carnage in May’s local elections. Government is paralysed. More Conservative MPs call for Johnson to step down. The “men in grey suits” from the 1922 committee decide to strike before the civil servant Sue Gray reports and tell him to go. Like Theresa May before him, Johnson falls on his sword.  Likelihood: moderate but increasing. 2. Johnson is ousted within two weeks, after Sue Gray’s report Gray reports at the end of this week. Johnson tries to spin her highly critical conclusions as little more than a rap over the knuckles for him and No 10. Rishi Sunak quits as chancellor, saying enough is enough and that he is ready to stand. At least 54 Tory MPs (the minimum needed) write to 1922 chair, Sir Graham Brady, triggering a vote of confidence in Johnson which the PM loses, bringing his premiership to a disastrous end. Likelihood: High. 3. Johnson survives until after the May local elections, only then to be dumped by his party The Gray report is critical but fails to deliver a “smoking gun”. Johnson and his team at No 10 somehow manage to limp on, after apologising again for their errors and saying the last thing the country needs is a Tory leadership contest. Tory MPs give the PM one more chance. But the electorate is seething. The May local elections deliver thumping Tory losses. Sunak resigns as does foreign secretary Liz Truss. Johnson suffers humiliating defeat in a confidence vote of his MPs, so has to quit under party rules. Likelihood: Moderate. 4. Johnson survives until the next election … and possibly beyond. Sue Gray’s report is a damp squib, full of Whitehall equivocation, letting the prime minister off the hook. The Tory party returns to the view that Johnson is a born survivor as well as a winner. Sunak and Truss pretend they had always been loyal. Covid all but disappears from the UK and Johnson claims credit. Keir Starmer and Labour seem to have missed their chance. Johnson remains prime minister and leads his party into the next election. Likelihood. Low and getting lower.

1/16/2022,"Zonked on patriotic zeal, Americans believe that their country is an exception to all historical rules. The land of the free, however, is currently hurtling towards a predetermined, apparently unavoidable crack-up. Its governmental institutions are paralysed, and a constitution devised for an agrarian society in the 18th century obstructs reform; its citizens, outnumbered by the guns they tote, have split into armed, antagonistic tribes. Given these conditions, the riot at the Capitol last January may have been the rehearsal for an imminent civil war.  Looking down at this hot mess from chilly Toronto, the Canadian novelist and essayist Stephen Marche grimly predicts: “The United States is coming to an end.” Such a declaration could only be made by an outsider. To Americans, the idea of civil war remains unthinkable, the words unspeakable: at his inauguration Biden vowed to end “this uncivil war”, which implied that the only missiles being exchanged were harmlessly verbal. As Marche sees it, the impending war will be a continuation of the earlier one between Union and Confederacy, which broke off in 1865 without closing the gap between races, regions and economic prospects. To these human-made iniquities Marche adds the intemperance of nature: New York is likely to be inundated by a forthcoming hurricane, and Californian forests are already burning. In 1776 the founding fathers envisaged an egalitarian renewal of humanity. Now the decline of the US warns that the anthropocene era may be doomed. Marche, doubting that the walls erected by Fortress America can keep out refugees, the poor and the rising oceans, suspects that this is “how a species goes extinct”. The Next Civil War is fatalistic yet somehow elated as Marche vividly imagines the “incredibly intense events” that lie ahead. He has done the required historical research and conducted interviews with officials and academic experts, but he can’t resist elaborating scenarios for conflagration and collapse which he offers as examples of “the genre of future civil war fantasy”. One of these, narrated with sour amusement, concerns an explosive dispute in a western state where local protesters, riled up by a wily, cynical sheriff, do battle with federal bureaucrats who have closed down an unsafe bridge. Another, which resembles the plot of the disaster movie The Day After Tomorrow, follows an evacuee from flooded Brooklyn who pauses to reflect that a sunken highway looks “almost beautiful”. A third “thought experiment” tracks a nerdy loner who guns down the US president in a Jamba Juice outlet, after which a commentator solemnly describes the motive of misfits like this as a “desire for transcendence”. As Marche says, “the power of spectacle is driving American politics”, and his “cultural scripts” turn terror into lurid entertainment. He takes his cue from movies such as Independence Day or Olympus Has Fallen, which stage the apocalypse as an adventure ride; the difference is that this time no superhero flies or rides in to rescue the republic. Marche awards “iconic status” to the atrocities of 9/11 but mocks the agitators in his own fable about the bridge as “ludicrous fanatics” who seem to be dressed for Halloween or a rock festival: is he daring them to do better? There is a tempting, titillating danger to this, because sooner or later such prophecies will be fulfilled in action. Marche may be enjoying his novelistic nightmares a little too much, possibly even smirking from the safety of Canada as the US dismembers itself. A similarly excited anticipation of the end briefly disrupts Barbara Walter’s study, How Civil Wars Start and How to Stop Them. Walter teaches political science in San Diego, and she writes with dutiful academic sobriety as she compares her disintegrating country to failing states in the Balkans and the Middle East. She studies graphs, fiddles with data sets and deploys nonsensical jargon, classifying the US as an “anocracy” because it is midway between democracy and autocracy. But her droning lecture flares into life when she, like Marche, sets herself to imagine what an American civil war would look like. Projected ahead to 2028, the result resembles a hyped-up Hollywood pitch, with the synchronised detonation of dirty bombs in state legislatures, a botched presidential assassination bid, freelance militias patrolling the streets, and – worst of all! – assaults on big-box stores. Like Marche, Walter is aware that political warriors need the support of a “mythic narrative”, and she notices that some of the insurrectionists at the Capitol carried Bibles: in the absence of a sacred text, will the garbled synopsis of a disaster movie do just as well? After these dramatic flurries, Walter calms down as she suggests ways of averting conflict. Most of her proposals require constitutional change, which she must know will never happen or will come too late; she also recommends reintroducing the study of civics in American schools, as if those pious courses in communal engagement could be an antidote to civil war. Walter admits that following the last election, when Trump refused to concede defeat, she and her husband considered emigrating. They flicked through their flotilla of available passports – Swiss, German and Hungarian as well as American and Canadian – and decided on driving north to cross the border into British Columbia. Ultimately they chose to remain in California, as Walter announces after ritually reciting the national creed and thanking the US for “the gift to pursue our dreams”. Marche concludes his book with a more guarded tribute to the perhaps naive American “faith in human nature” and the constitution’s risky “openness to difference”. He then explains why he is glad to live in Toronto: Canadians, he says, “talk placidly and exchange endless nothings” rather than bragging, ranting and abusing each other like their southern neighbours, and they only have the weather’s “cold snaps” to contend with, not incendiary social convulsions. In times such as ours, to be snugly domiciled in a boring country is surely the best bet.

1/16/2022,"Sometimes, Instagram feeds find a language of their own. Our editor came across Edgar Ortiz’s work while scrolling. Ortiz, 38, is a hobbyist photographer and musician. He specialises in streetscapes like this one, in which the city can seem on fire. He gives each of his pictures a moody soundtrack – this one comes with Better Believe as a backing, an epic rap by Belly, the Weeknd and Young Thug. Music came first for Ortiz – he’s been involved in that since he was 16. He has only been taking pictures seriously for a couple of years. You don’t really need the soundtrack to catch the emotion of this picture, though. It was taken from a train platform in downtown Chicago, the city in which Ortiz has always lived. Like nearly all of his pictures it is a lyrical hymn to the urban energy of his city. Sometimes, he focuses on faces, but these long drive-by vanishing points recur as backdrops, giving the pictures an ambiguous intensity and possibility, one part Mean Streets, one part Yellow Brick Road. His pictures are included in the feed of the influential street art community, BCNcollective, which showcases emerging talent.  Ortiz is inspired by the neo-noir pictures of Billy Dinh and Nicolas Miller, all mist and night sky and neon reflection. He says he is always looking for external landscapes to match an image he has in his head. Some of his fiery aesthetic, he believes, comes from the fact that he is colourblind: “I love black-and-white photography,” he says, “but I have tried to challenge myself to do colour photography.” In his way of sensing the world, those car tail-lights bleeding beautifully over the rain slicked street, carry a particular resonance; in the fast-forward world of Instagram you don’t have to look at his pictures for long to sense Ortiz sees things slightly differently.

1/16/2022,"Spider-Man, Batman, Black Panther and Superman, stars of the strip cartoons printed in comics and at the bottom of newspaper pages, have gone on to inspire film franchises or, in the case of Little Orphan Annie, who started in a syndicated strip, a popular stage and film musical. Celebrated in popular culture across the world, these fictional characters are all children who lost their parents at an early age. It is a tried and tested, tragic narrative formula that efficiently releases them into the wider world, as well as exposing them to danger.  This April, London’s Foundling Museum is to mount a major exhibition that delves into the lasting and powerful presence of orphans, adoptees and foster-children in comic-strip storytelling. “It’s a part of our society that we don’t think or talk about much, yet it’s hiding in plain sight all over popular culture,” said Caro Howell, director of the museum, first founded in 1739 as a shelter for abandoned children. “From little Annie onwards, the world is familiar with the way these characters survived without parents, but it is a lived reality for hundreds of thousands of children growing up away from their family or in care. Like these fictional orphans, they need immense resilience to get over the trauma and build an identity. How do they build a sense of self-worth?” said Howell. The exhibition, Superheroes, Orphans & Origins: 125 Years in Comics, will cover the narrative threads laid out in mainstream comics, graphic novels and sequential art in different countries, and look at the bleak origins and complex identities of some of the most popular characters. DC Comics’ Superman was found by his adoptive parents, while Spider-Man’s mother and father die in a plane crash. Batman’s parents are killed in a street robbery and Black Panther is known as “the orphan king” after his mother dies soon after childbirth and his father is killed. Marvel’s X-Men also experience early discrimination and social ostracisation that later shape the stance they take on good and evil. But it is not all about traditional superheroes in garish outfits. The exhibition will look also at other characters from early newspaper strips, including Skeezix from Gasoline Alley, who was left on a doorstep in 1921. And among the original artwork displayed for the first time will be artist Robyn Smith’s 2021 recreation of Nubia, the black sister of Wonder Woman, for DC Comics. “These are people who have had to construct their identity against a background of huge social stigma. They are outsiders,” said Howell. “This is also the source of their power and what makes them special. But it keeps them alone, struggling to form permanent relationship sometimes.” Images of Superman and Batman from the 1940s and 1950s will be shown alongside early copies of Marvel’s Black Panther and special editions of X-Men from the 1970s and 1980s. Original drawings from Sunny and other historic comics, including Hogan’s Alley, are on display, as well as Sanmao, which translates as “three hairs” and was created in 1935 by revered Chinese cartoonist Zhang Leping. It goes on display in Britain for the first time. The exhibition has its origins in work from 2014 commissioned by the museum from poet and performer Lemn Sissay, who grew up in care. His poem Superman Was a Foundling was printed on the walls of the museum’s Study Studio and was intended to draw attention to the disparity between our admiration for fostered, adopted or orphaned fictional characters and what Sissay saw as a widespread disregard for their real-life counterparts. “For people who grew up without birth parents, the Foundling Museum is a place of visibility and even validation,” said Howell. “By exploring this overlooked aspect of the superhero origin story, we hope to raise awareness of the immense resilience needed to overcome separation, loss, stigma and society’s indifference.” Many of the other works going on display have been created by international artists inspired by their own experiences in care. Carlos Giménez, creator of Paracuellos (1976), spent much of his Spanish childhood moving between the “social aid” homes created during the Franco era. Lisa Wool-Rim Sjöblom’s 2019 work Palimpsest reflects on her status as an international adoptee. Born in Korea, she lived in an orphanage until the age of two and was then adopted, and lived in Sweden. Keiji Nakazawa survived the Hiroshima bombing, but his father, brother and sister died. His mother later died of related health issues, prompting him to create the manga series Barefoot Gen. Themes of abandonment and identity are traced through comic strips to the present day. Japanese manga characters from the 1990s and early 2000s, Kuro and Shiro from Tekkonkinkreet, appear alongside American comic Jesse “Street Angel” Sanchez and contemporary graphic-novel protagonists including Amina from Zenobia, who is a Syrian refugee.",Arts/Books,‘Me against the world’: why superheroes are so often orphans,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/16/me-against-the-world-why-superheroes-are-so-often-orphans
1/16/2022,"One year ago on Thursday, Joe Biden took the oath of office as the 46th president at the US Capitol in an inauguration ceremony devoid of the usual crowds due to pandemic restrictions.  Biden identified four crises facing America: the coronavirus, the climate, the economy and racial justice. He could have added a fifth: a crisis of democracy in a divided nation where, just two weeks earlier, the Capitol had been overrun by insurrectionists. How has he fared on all five counts? Biden took office pledging to lift the threat of the coronavirus pandemic, which he called “a raging virus” that “silently stalks the country”. And there was a period of his presidency when it appeared he had. Last summer vaccination rates soared as the virus receded and the economy rebounded. Touting the administration’s progress at an Independence Day celebration, Biden declared that the US was “closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus”. But then came the arrival of the Delta variant, followed by the extremely transmissible Omicron variant. Biden rushed once again to restrict travel but it did little to slow the spread. In recent weeks, Covid-19 cases have reached record levels. Deaths are rising nationally and the number of Americans hospitalized with the disease is higher now than at any previous point during the pandemic. Long lines to obtain Covid tests and low availability of at-home tests have sparked criticism of the White House’s preparedness, while shifting guidelines and muddled messaging from federal public health officials left a disease-weary public confused and frustrated. Public confidence in Biden’s handling of the pandemic has dropped significantly, weighing down his overall approval ratings. Biden responded by ordering 1bn at-home coronavirus tests and is requiring private insurance companies to cover the cost of up to eight of these tests a month. Biden also announced plans to make “high-quality” masks available to Americans free of charge and deployed military medical units to help hospitals overwhelmed by a shortage of staff and beds. Leveraging the Defense Production Act, the administration is working with pharmaceutical companies to increase the supply of antiviral pills. More than 200 million Americans are fully vaccinated, with nearly 77 million receiving a booster shot. Efforts to improve vaccination rates continue to be undermined by partisanship and misinformation. And a ruling by the supreme court this week blocked the Biden administration from enforcing a vaccine-or-test mandate for large businesses, though it allowed a vaccine mandate for most healthcare workers to take effect. In response to the latest wave, the Biden administration has shifted its rhetoric – and its expectations. Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease specialist, said the Omicron variant would “find just about everybody”, warning that the unvaccinated risk far worse outcomes. In his inaugural address, Biden promised to heed the planet’s “cry for survival” by marshalling an unprecedented response to the climate crisis. But his ambitious plans have since collided with the reality of an evenly divided Senate, where a coal-state senator’s opposition has thwarted major pieces of the president’s climate agenda, with potentially dire consequences for the planet. At the international talks in Glasgow last year, Biden pledged the US would slash its greenhouse gas emissions in half compared with 2005 levels by the end of this decade. But failure to enact the president’s Build Back Better legislation would make it nearly impossible for the US to meet that target. The roughly $2tn proposal would amount to the nation’s largest ever investment in combatting climate change and contains a suite of tax incentives, grants and other policies that would grow the green energy sector and invest in sustainable vehicles and public transport services. Without it, the Biden administration would be forced to rely on a raft of environmental regulations and rules that could be overturned by future presidents. Throughout the first year of his presidency, Biden has made climate change a priority, elevating climate advocates to key posts, creating a White House office of domestic policy, and appointing John Kerry as the special presidential envoy for climate, which he made a cabinet-level position. In April, he convened a summit to pressure world leaders to make stronger commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reassert US leadership on the global stage. Biden used his executive authority to quickly reverse many of former president Donald Trump’s energy and environmental policies, starting with his first day in office when he moved to rejoin the Paris climate accords. In November, Biden signed into law a $1tn bipartisan infrastructure bill that provides billions of dollars to make communities more resilient to climate-fueled disasters, but did little to reduce planet-warming emissions. At the international talks last year, the US played a major role in negotiations over global efforts to fight climate change, though the final agreement disappointed activists and some world leaders. “This is the challenge of our collective lifetimes, an existential threat to human existence as we know it and every day we delay the cost of inaction increases,” Biden said in Glasgow. Yet the coming weeks and months will be critical for Biden’s climate goals, and his legacy. The president’s Build Back Better legislation is doomed without Senator Joe Manchin’s support and it remains unclear if negotiations can be revived. Next month the supreme court will hear a case brought by Republican-led states and coal companies that could significantly restrict the administration’s power to regulate carbon emissions driving climate change. And if Republicans gain control of Congress in this year’s midterm elections, action on climate change could stall, potentially for years. It is the best of times and the worst of times. The White House ended 2021 pointing to jobless claims at a 50-year low, a stock market smashing records and an economy among the fastest growing in the world. On the positive side, 6.4m jobs have been added under Biden, the most of any first-year president in history. When he took office the unemployment rate was 6.3%; today it is 3.9%, the lowest yet of the pandemic. Consumer demand is strong, helping the economy grow by an estimated 7% in the final quarter of 2021, although the Omicron variant, which has ravaged airlines and restaurants, is likely to cause a slowdown. Wages are also up. With a record wave of people quitting their jobs, often to seek work elsewhere, average hourly pay jumped 4.7% in December compared with a year ago. The stock market is thriving. In 2021 the Standard and Poor 500 index hit new records 70 times and finished up 29%. This beat Donald Trump’s first year as president when the S&P 500 hit new records 62 times and finished up 17%. There is, of course, a “but” coming. The economy is still about 3.6m jobs short of its pre-pandemic level. Many employers are struggling to fill positions and many people are reluctant to return to the workforce. Most dauntingly, inflation climbed to 7% in 2021, the biggest 12-month gain for 40 years, while supply chain problems left some supermarket shelves bare. This prompted a barrage of Republican criticism and fed a feeling of economic malaise, whatever the reality. Allan Lichtman, a distinguished professor of history at American University in Washington, said: “The economy is actually better than the perception. Unemployment is down to 3.9%. Many millions of jobs were created and you’re going to get inflation under those circumstances. But the message hasn’t gotten out. Everybody thinks Biden’s done a poor job.” Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster and strategist, instead argues that Biden overpromised. “The entire economy is seizing up, and people do blame Biden because he was trumpeting how successful he had been,” he said. “Don’t do that.” “President Biden met with some of the civil rights leadership and we reminded him …You said the night you won that Black America had your back and that you were going to have Black America’s back,” activist Al Sharpton told a voting rights rally in August. “Well, Mr President, they’re stabbing us in the back.” Biden is yet to fulfil his promise. But he has met some of his commitments to embed racial equity in policy. The early $1.9tn coronavirus relief package included $5bn for Black farmers, the most important legislation for this group since the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Biden named a historically diverse administration that includes, in interior secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary. Kamala Harris is the first woman of colour to serve as vice-president, though she has been handed intractable problems to solve and her approval rating is even lower than Biden’s. But police reform efforts have stalled. Biden abandoned a campaign promise to create a national police oversight commission in his first hundred days. Talks in Congress over the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which aims to improve police training, curb use of excessive force and end techniques such as chokeholds, collapsed in September in what Jacari Harris, executive director of a foundation named after Floyd, described as “a devastating setback”. Most dramatically, the president’s lobbying efforts have failed to deliver on protecting voting rights for people of colour. National legislation aimed at blunting Republican-led state efforts to impose voter restrictions has stalled in the Senate, where a 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans leaves no margin for error. Democrats Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have declared their opposition to reform of a procedural rule known as the filibuster, a necessary step for passing the legislation. Biden is accused by critics of doing too little too late, failing to use his bully pulpit to give the issue the same priority as his bipartisan infrastructure law. In a sign of the disappointment and exasperation, when Biden travelled to Atlanta this week to make his most aggressive case yet for filibuster reform, some campaigners boycotted the event. Charles Blow, a columnist for the New York Times, wrote: “For a year, activists have been screaming and pleading and begging and getting arrested, trying to get the White House to put the full weight of the presidency behind protecting voting rights, only to be met by silence or soft-pedaling.” He added: “When Biden fully entered the battle, the other warriors were already bloody, bruised and exhausted.” In his inaugural address, Biden proclaimed: “We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.” Restoring the soul of the nation, he added, requires that most elusive of things in a democracy: “Unity.” Nearly a year later, back at the US Capitol, Biden struck a very different and more pugnacious tone. “I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy,” he vowed, signaling a belated realisation that instead of repairing the breach with Republicans, he must now stand in it and fight. Biden, who had run for election as an apostle of bipartisanship, and did get a win with Republican support for a $1tn infrastructure law. But the radicalised opposition party remains implacably opposed to legislation that would codify national protections for voting rights (see above). Republicans remain in the iron grip of Trump, his “big lie” that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him and the delusion that the January 6 insurrection was inconsequential or even a righteous cause. Trump acolytes and election deniers are now seeking office as secretaries of state and other positions that would put them in charge of running of future elections. This could given them the power to overturn results they do not like. This year Biden has begun to speak out forcefully on the voting rights issue – “Do you want to be the side of Dr King or George Wallace? Do you want to be on the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor?” he demanded in Atlanta – but less so on the more insidious, precinct-by-precinct threat to the electoral process. Tony Evers, the Democratic governor of Wisconsin, told the Guardian last month: “At the state level we’re raising hell about it but the Democrats on the national level are talking about Build Back Better, the infrastructure bill, lots of other things.” Biden’s mission to heal divisions has crashed into polarisation that has only been accelerated by the pandemic and its battles over mask and vaccine mandates, as well as Republican-stoked culture wars over schools and critical race theory. Far from fading away, Trump is resuming campaign rallies ahead of a possible run for the White House in 2024.",News/US news,"Joe Biden’s first year: Covid, climate, the economy, racial justice and democracy",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/16/joe-bidens-first-year-covid-climate-the-economy-racial-justice-and-democracy
1/16/2022,"People will go to all sorts of lengths to move towards a more environmentally friendly lifestyle. Changing where and how they buy their clothes, cutting down on meat and dairy, and replacing trips in the car with journeys by foot. I’ve done all of those – but I’ve taken it further. Six months ago, I had my blood tested for 100 different persistent organic pollutants or POPs – chemicals such as pesticides and flame retardants that accumulate inside us and stick around for longer than we’d like. Scientists at a specialist lab in Norway found traces of chemicals that were taken off the market decades ago, such as low levels of a metabolite of the infamous pesticide DDT, alongside concerning levels of some of the less well-known “forever chemicals” known as PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances – a class of chemicals that includes the likes of Teflon). Most surprisingly, my blood contained relatively high levels of a chemical called oxychlordane that comes from a pesticide known as chlordane that was banned by the EU in 1981, just a year after I was born, so exposure was probably via the womb. What struck me most is that some of these highly hazardous chemicals last more than a lifetime.  And so began my mission to find out how we can better protect ourselves – and the next generation – from these legacy pollutants. Perhaps because toxic chemical pollution isn’t that obvious, it is often overlooked. So while public awareness of single-use plastic waste has soared in recent years – all of those bottles, straws and carrier bags are tangible symptoms of our disposable mindset and overconsumption – there’s much more to the story. So, in a bid to reduce my chemical footprint, and that of my family, I’ve scrubbed up on the science and distilled the latest research into practical and simple tips. Ultimately, it’s time that we joined the dots and made this invisible world much more visible. Don’t be duped by clever marketing campaigns that aim to convince us we need the latest eco thingamajig. No product might be better than a less toxic one. If a label makes sustainability claims, look for proof – download a shopping app such as Giki, which allows you to scan supermarket products to see how sustainable they are. Beware of unregulated language such as “natural”, “eco-friendly”, “nature-inspired” and be suspicious of products that say they are “chemical free” (there is no such thing – everything is a chemical and not all chemicals are bad) or “free from”. Look for brands that are fully transparent about their supply chains and the ingredients they do use rather than distracting with mentions of things they don’t include. Think before you flush anything down the toilet or the plughole – most bottles of cleaning products that contain chlorine bleach have a picture of a dead fish on the back and for good reason. They poison aquatic wildlife but also act as irritants to us. Overuse of bleach leads to antimicrobial resistance and, in most cases, gentle cleaning products, such as bicarbonate of soda or vinegar mixed with lemon juice, plus a little elbow grease, do the job just fine. Our homes aren’t sterile places – save disinfectants for medical settings and look out for an emerging trend for probiotic cleaning products that fight germs by encouraging healthy bacteria. Advice to do more dusting may not be a tip you’re keen to follow, but actually it’s about more targeted dusting. Adults unwittingly ingest about 20mg of dust every day. Children and pets even more so. But many toxic chemicals released from products in our home accumulate in dust, from fragrances to PFASs, so it’s important to wipe it away regularly with a damp cloth – no polish required. Rather than concentrating your efforts on windowsills and shelves, make sure to clean electronics such as the wifi router, DVD player and game consoles, as flame retardants can transfer into dust settling on these items. Our homes shouldn’t smell of overpowering scents such as pine cones or sea spray. Air fresheners are a concentrated source of indoor air contaminants that can exacerbate conditions such as asthma. Residues of fragranced detergents stay on clothes and linen, too. While not all synthetic fragrances are harmful, their many ingredients are not usually listed in full and we might not be told enough about what’s in them. From school trousers lined with strengthening Teflon knee patches to non-stick cookware, food packaging and smudgeproof mascara, PFAS chemicals are added to so many everyday products. These super stable chemicals last for ever, in our bodies and in the environment. Many of them are endocrine-disrupting – which means they disrupt our hormone system – and some may be carcinogens. Things that claim they are waterproof, stain-resistant, wrinkle-free or grease-repellent probably contain PFASs. If you are unsure, there is a clever test you can do called the bead test. For this, you drop a tiny amount of olive oil on to a surface. If the oil repels into a bead shape, it is highly likely to contain PFAS chemicals. Then you can decide: do the alleged benefits of the product outweigh the potentially toxic cost? If you’re not happy, make a conscious effort to seek out PFAS-free alternatives. Pesticide residues remain on our fruit and veg, inside loaves of bread, on non-organic cotton bedding and even non-organic tampons. These agricultural chemicals, sprayed on crops to kill insects, weeds and fungi, are in every room of the home. Try streamlining your exposure by switching to organic for the foods you eat most of. There is a really helpful guide to how UK supermarkets are doing on this by the Pesticide Action Network (PAN). It ranks British supermarkets according to pesticide use. Perhaps underlining the adage you get what you pay for, M&S and Waitrose come out top, but even these two have a way to go. The accumulation of indoor air pollutants and volatile organic compounds or VOCs (things such as formaldehyde and benzene) can be avoided by simply opening a window. Ventilate well if you are lighting an open fire (electric heating from renewable sources is cleaner all round) and use an extractor while cooking if you have one. The back hob rings are preferable if you have a cooker hood to capture more pollutants. At night, body heat increases the temperature in our beds so more VOCs can “off-gas” or be released from conventional polyurethane mattresses, so ventilate your bedroom or, better still, invest in a mattress topper made from natural materials. That off-gassing of VOCs happens from a lot of furniture and medium-density fibreboard (MDF), more so when new, so search out vintage bargains, especially if you’re decorating a room for children. If you do buy new, unwrap it and let it air for a few days before you install. If you’re putting up shelves or other fixtures, use screws rather than glues and adhesives. And if you’re upcycling, use low-VOC paints and varnishes. Buy secondhand clothes and textiles – they will contain drastically reduced pesticide residues, if any, and you’ll be saving the need to make more new items. A high toxic load puts more strain on our body’s own natural detox mechanisms, mainly the liver and kidneys, just as smoking or drinking do. So eat plenty of antioxidants, which help to neutralise the free radicals that are produced after exposure to toxins and can damage DNA and lead to degenerative diseases. So plenty of leafy, green veg, nuts and berries – organic if possible!

1/16/2022,"Few reporters are synonymous with their craft. Bob Woodward of the Washington Post is one, his former partner, Carl Bernstein, another. Together, they broke open the Watergate scandal, helped send a president’s minions to prison and made Richard Nixon the only man to resign the office. On the big screen, Robert Redford played Woodward. Bernstein got Dustin Hoffman. These days, Bernstein is a CNN analyst and a contributing editor at Vanity Fair. Chasing History, his sixth book, is a warm and inviting read.  Now 77, he writes with the benefit of hindsight and the luxury of self-imposed deadlines. His prose is dry and reflective even as it draws in the reader. This is his look back and valedictory, with a fitting subtitle: “A Kid in the Newsroom.” He describes life before the Post, in pages marked with politics – and haberdashery. “I needed a suit.” So the book begins. Shortly thereafter: “My mother and father, in the early 1950s, had taken me with them to join the sit-ins at Woodward & Lothrop to desegregate its tea room.” “Woodies”, a department store, closed in 1995. In the 50s, rather than testify before the House Un-American Affairs Committee, Bernstein’s mother invoked her right against self-incrimination. His father suffered for past membership in the Communist party. The FBI of J Edgar Hoover was an unwelcome presence in the Bernsteins’ lives. Still in high school, Bernstein worked as a part-time copy boy for the Washington Star. “Now that I’d covered the inauguration of JFK, Mr Adelman’s chemistry class interested me even less,” he confesses. He barely scraped out of high school, flunked out of the University of Maryland and lost his deferment from the Vietnam draft. He found a spot in a national guard unit, removing the possibility of deployment and combat. Chasing History also includes a copy of Bernstein’s college transcript, which advertises a sea of Fs and the capitalized notation: “ACADEMICALLY DISMISSED 1-27-65.” On the other hand, before he was old enough to vote, Bernstein had covered or reported more than most journalists do in a lifetime. The 1960 presidential election, the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Kennedy assassination, desegregation and Martin Luther King’s March on Washington. All were part of his remit. The integration of DC’s barber shops, a race-fueled brawl at a high school football game, the death of a newspaper vendor. In a nation in upheaval, all captured Bernstein’s attention. He is one of the last of his breed, a national reporter without a degree. Chasing History reminds us that by the mid-1960s, newsrooms were no longer dominated by working-class inflections. Carbon paper, hot lead typesetting, ink-stained fingers and smocks would also give way, to computers and digitization. The Ivy League emerged as a training ground of choice. Television would outpace print. Rough edges would be smoothed and polished, a premium placed on facts. Hard-knocks, not so much. “A big generational change was occurring in the journalism trade,” Bernstein writes. “Editors wanted college graduates now. My view was that you might be better prepared by graduating from horticultural school than from Yale or Princeton.” The kicker: “At least that way you could write the gardening column.” Emphasis on the word “might”, though. Woodward went to Yale. To this day, they count each other as friends. Chasing History is more about gratitude than grievance. For 10 pages, Bernstein recalls the names of his “young friends”, their “remarkable paths”, his intersection with those who would emerge as “historical footnotes” and his “teachers and mentors”. Lance Morrow, formerly of Time and the Wall Street Journal, makes it on to the dedication page. They were housemates and worked at the Star. Later, their careers flourished. Morrow, according to Bernstein, “occupies a unique place in the journalism of our time” and has been an “incomparable joy” in the author’s life. Likewise, Ben Stein – and his appearance as an economics teacher in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, in 1986 – earns more than a passing shoutout. The fact Stein and his father served in the Nixon administration did not dent Bernstein’s fondness. They grew up nextdoor to each other in the DC suburbs. In junior high, the boys founded a “lox-and-bagel/Sunday New York Times delivery service”. The two see each other yearly. Bernstein also pays his respects to David Broder, the late dean of the political press corps. On 23 November 1962, as a copy boy, Bernstein took dictation from Broder, who was in Dallas that fateful Friday afternoon. Years later, Broder provided a useful tip that helped shape the path and coverage of “Woodstein’s” Watergate reporting. One mentor of particular note was George Porter, a Star bureau chief to whom Bernstein refers respectfully as Mr Porter and who regularly gave Bernstein a ride to the office. During the Democratic primaries in 1964, Porter dispatched Bernstein to cover George Wallace, the segregationist Alabama governor. Wallace never had a chance but his candidacy was newsworthy. Think Donald Trump, prototype. Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat, was in the White House but Wallace got nearly 30% in Indiana. When Wallace turned to Maryland, Bernstein was there on the ground. It was the first time he’d “seen a demagogue inflame the emotions of American citizens who I’d thought were familiar to me”. Wallace lost but netted 40% and a majority of white votes. In defeat, he blamed Black voters, except he chose a word that began with “N”, and an “incompetent press”, for failing to recognize his appeal. The church, labor unions, Ted Kennedy and “every other Democratic senator from the north” were also subjects of Wallace’s scorn. Chasing History is part-autobiography, part-history lesson. Amid continued turbulence, Bernstein’s memoirs are more than mere reminiscence.

1/16/2022,"Novak Djokovic will be deported from Australia ahead of the Australian Open after the full federal court dismissed the world No 1’s bid to restore his visa. On Sunday the court rejected a challenge to the decision of Australian immigration minister, Alex Hawke, to cancel the visa on the basis Djokovic’s presence in Australia might risk “civil unrest” as he is a “talisman of anti-vaccination sentiment”.  Chief Justice James Allsop announced the court unanimously dismissed Djokovic’s application, with costs to be paid by the tennis star. Allsop explained the decision of the court did not reflect on “the merits or wisdom of the decision” but rather whether it was so irrational as to be unlawful. Full reasons will follow at a later date. The decision is a major setback for Djokovic’s quest to win a 10th Australian Open crown and a record 21st grand slam title. Djokovic’s lawyers had argued Hawke’s decision was “illogical, irrational or unreasonable” and the minister based it on Djokovic’s public statements about vaccination without actually seeking his views. In fresh submissions overnight, Djokovic’s lawyers added that Hawke had failed to consider the impact on anti-vaccination sentiment if his visa were cancelled. In court on Sunday, the minister’s counsel, Stephen Lloyd, argued Australia “must not be bound to suffer the presence of an alien for fear of what might happen if they were removed”. Use of the ministerial power to cancel a visa comes with a three-year ban on re-entering Australia, except in compelling circumstances, such as compassionate or Australian national interest grounds. Djokovic arrived in Australia on the evening of 5 January. He believed that a visa granted on 18 November and a medical exemption approved by Tennis Australia and a Victorian government independent expert panel would be sufficient to enter Australia. Djokovic’s visa was first cancelled by Australian Border Force hours after he arrived at Melbourne airport and he was taken to a detention hotel. On Monday a federal circuit court judge restored Djokovic’s visa, concluding it was unreasonable for the ABF to renege on a deal to give him more time at the airport to address the exemption issue. After a week’s deliberation, Hawke cancelled Djokovic’s visa again on Friday on the new ground that his presence might be a risk to “health and good order”. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, backed the cancellation decision, arguing that Australians had “made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected”. “This is what the minister is doing in taking this action,” Morrison said in a statement on Friday.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic faces deportation from Australia after federal court upholds visa cancellation,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/16/novak-djokovic-to-be-deported-from-australia-after-losing-appeal-against-visa-cancellation
1/16/2022,"Labour will today announce ambitious plans to create a country that can “live well with Covid” without the need for future harsh restrictions, as it seeks to prevent Boris Johnson claiming credit for his record on the virus. Keir Starmer said he wanted people to be able to “live their lives as normal” and never again face “tough restrictions on our lives, our livelihoods and our liberties”.  Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting’s 10-point plan includes measures to raise sick pay, improve testing, share vaccines worldwide and transform social care. It comes as Johnson and his ministers are desperately attempting to shore up the prime minister’s leadership, amid growing calls for him to resign over the “partygate” controversy, by talking up his handling of the pandemic and the vaccine programme at every opportunity. With the government preparing to ease many Covid restrictions when plan B measures are reviewed on 26 January, Labour is determined to remind people of the Tories’ “chaotic” performance over PPE, testing and other Covid issues, while positioning itself as ready to keep life as normal as possible in the event of future surges. In a speech to the Fabian Society yesterday, Starmer said he was “convinced that a swifter response” could have reduced the Covid death toll which has reached at least 150,000. He said Labour’s first task in government would be to “clear up the mess that Tories have made of the NHS”. Streeting’s 10-point plan would raise statutory sick pay, making it available to all workers, including the self-employed and those on low wages currently cut out by the lower-earnings limit for eligibility. The party says it will scrap the qualifying time for sick pay so that workers can access it immediately, reducing the pressure people feel to work while unwell or potentially unwell. Streeting says his party will also build a “sovereign capability” to ensure a supply of test kits made in Britain, to mitigate against any global shortage, and champion new ideas in testing technology. In addition, Labour plans to use NHS volunteers in a massive nationwide effort to reach the 650,000 as yet unvaccinated people at highest risk of severe disease from Covid with individual communication, in-person visits and mobile vaccination clinics. Streeting said: “We’re not out of the woods with Covid-19. The virus will change and adapt, and we need to learn to live well with it. For the government, living with Covid is just an empty slogan with no plan. For some of the fanatics on the Conservative backbenches, living with Covid means letting the virus rip. Both positions are highly irresponsible. “If we are to learn to live well with Covid, we need to be prepared. Labour’s plan will put Britain on the front foot and secure our lives, livelihoods and liberties.” Streeting added that the UK needed to play its part in vaccinating the rest of the world by sharing surplus vaccines. Also that it must protect education by shoring up testing supplies for children and fitting schools with ventilation systems. The latest phase of the pandemic has seen Covid-19 infections rising in the north of England but “plateauing” in the south, Susan Hopkins, the UK Health Security Agency’s chief medical adviser, said yesterday. About one in 15 people in England have the virus, Office for National Statistics figures show, and admissions to hospital are slowing down to just under 2,000 patients a day. Yet the NHS remains under “a lot of pressure”, Hopkins said, with more than 15,000 Covid patients in hospital in England – only slightly fewer than in the first 2020 wave – and many NHS trusts having halted elective surgery. Last week, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said there was likely to be a second Omicron wave in the early summer, with their modelling predicting up to 4,000 admissions to hospital a day, with other projections suggesting 1,000 admissions. Tomorrow, 16 and 17-year-olds will be able to book booster jabs online, in the latest phase of the vaccination campaign. Sajid Javid, England’s health secretary, is expected to recommend that the requirement for people to provide proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter large events or nightclubs in England ends when plan B restrictions are reviewed later this month. In addition, he is under pressure from MPs in his party to end the “work from home” guidance, which many believe is doing disproportionate damage to the economy and town and city centres. The requirement to wear masks in enclosed places may be left as the sole measure in place after the review. Last week, as Johnson faced a chorus of demands for his resignation from Tory MPs and opposition parties, cabinet ministers went out of their way to praise his “outstanding” leadership over the pandemic, insisting he had got all the “big calls” right, including resisting demands from many scientists at Christmas for tighter restrictions. He and the Tories received a huge bounce in the polls after the introduction of the vaccine programme, but Labour is determined to prevent a positive overall narrative developing about how the Johnson government dealt with Covid-19 in comparison with other countries in Europe and across the world.",News/World news,"Better sick pay, testing and ventilation: Labour’s Covid plan to keep UK open",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/better-sick-pay-testing-and-ventilation-labours-covid-plan-to-keep-uk-open
