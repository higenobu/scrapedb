4/22/2022,"On 20 July 1969, 650 million people throughout the world watched with bated breath as Neil Armstrong successfully fulfilled President Kennedy’s vision. The United States achieved what had seemed impossible just a few decades before. We had sent a man to the moon. On that historic day, the entire world came together to celebrate the enormous accomplishment as Armstrong’s voice boomed from our television sets: “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” In just eight short years the US, led by our extraordinary scientists, engineers and astronauts at Nasa, had opened up a new world for humanity. And while the entire world rejoiced, there was a special joy and pride in our country because this was an American project. It was our financing, our political will, our scientific ingenuity, our courage that had accomplished this milestone in human history. We had not only “won” the international space race, but more importantly, we had created unthinkable opportunities for all of humankind. Fifty-three years later, as a result of a huge effort to privatize space exploration, I am concerned that Nasa has become little more than an ATM machine to fuel a space race not between the US and other countries, but between the two wealthiest men in America – Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, who are worth more than $450bn combined. After many billions of dollars of taxpayer funding the American people are going to have to make a very fundamental decision. If we are going to send more human beings to the moon and eventually to Mars, who will control the enterprise and what will be the purpose of that exploration? Will the goal be to benefit the people of the United States and the entire world, or will it be a vast boondoggle to make billionaires even richer and open up outer space to corporate greed and exploitation? At this moment, if you can believe it, Congress is considering legislation to provide a $10bn bailout to Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin space company for a contract to build a lunar lander. This legislation is taking place after Blue Origin lost a competitive bid to SpaceX, Musk’s company. Bezos is worth some $180bn. In a given year, he has paid nothing in federal income taxes. He is the owner of Amazon, which, in a given year, has also paid nothing in federal income taxes after making billions in profits. Bezos has enough money to own a $500m mega-yacht, a $23m mansion in Washington DC, a $175m estate in Beverly Hills and a $78m, 14-acre estate in Maui. At a time when over half of the people in this country live paycheck to paycheck, when more than 70 million are uninsured or underinsured and when some 600,000 Americans are homeless, should we really be providing a multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailout for Bezos to fuel his space hobby? I don’t think so. Let’s be clear, however. This issue goes well beyond just one contract for Bezos to go to the moon. The reality is that the space economy – which today mostly consists of private companies utilizing Nasa facilities and technology essentially free of charge to launch satellites into orbit – is already very profitable and has the potential to become exponentially more profitable in the future. Bank of America predicts that over the next eight years the space economy will triple in size to $1.4tn – that’s trillion with a “t”. In 2018, private corporations made over $94bn in profits from goods or services that are used in space – profits that could not have been achieved without generous subsidies and support from Nasa and the taxpayers of America. The satellite business is growing rapidly. SpaceX alone plans to launch tens of thousands of its Starlink telecommunications satellites over the next few years. In addition to the launching of new satellites, corporations like SpaceX will be making substantial sums from the “space tourism” business. Recently, three extremely wealthy individuals paid $55m each in order to visit the International Space Station. The good news is that if you are a billionaire tired of vacationing in the Caribbean, there are some exciting travel opportunities for you. The bad news is that American taxpayers are subsidizing some of that trip. And while it may seem like a bad science fiction movie today, decades from now the real money to be made will not come from satellites or space tourism but to those who discover how to mine lucrative minerals on asteroids. In fact, both Goldman Sachs and the noted astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson have predicted that the world’s first trillionaire will be the person who figures out how to harness and exploit natural resources on asteroids. Nasa has identified over 12,000 asteroids within 45m kilometers of Earth that contain iron ore, nickel, precious metals and other minerals. Just a single 3,000ft asteroid may contain platinum worth over $5tn. Another asteroid’s rare earth metals could be worth more than $20tn alone. According to the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Peter Diamandis, “There are twenty-trillion-dollar checks up there, waiting to be cashed!” The questions we must ask are: who will be cashing those checks? Who will, overall, be benefiting from space exploration? Will it be a handful of billionaires or will it be the people of our country and all of humanity? As it stands now, as a result of the 2015 Space Act that passed the Senate with virtually no floor debate, private corporations are able to own all of the resources that they discover in space. In other words, the taxpayers of this country who made it possible for these private enterprises to go into space will get a 0% return on their investment. The time is now to have a serious debate in Congress and throughout our country as to how to develop a rational space policy that does not simply socialize all of the risks and privatize all of the profits. Whether it is expanding affordable high-speed internet and cellphone service in remote areas, tracking natural disasters and climate change, establishing colonies on the moon and Mars or mining asteroids, the scientific achievements we make should be shared by all of us, not just the wealthy few. Space exploration is very exciting. Its potential to improve life here on planet Earth is limitless. But it also has the potential to make the richest people in the world incredibly richer and unimaginably more powerful. When we take that next giant leap into space let us do it to benefit all of humanity, not to turn a handful of billionaires into trillionaires.

4/22/2022,"Emmanuel Macron appears to have opened up his lead against the French presidential rival, Marine Le Pen, according to the latest opinion polls, on the last day of campaigning before Sunday’s second-round vote. In an Ipsos survey, 57.5% of those questioned said they intended to vote for the incumbent president, against 42.5% for Le Pen. Even allowing for a 3.3 point margin of error, a result along those lines would give Macron a convincing victory. Only 5% of those polled who said they would vote for Macron thought they could change their mind, compared with 8% of those who intend to vote for Le Pen. But in a sign of uncertainty about the final result, more than 40% of those who said they would vote blank said they might still choose one of the candidates. Another poll by BVA published on Friday suggests Macron would win by a margin of 11 percentage points. On Friday, hours before the midnight deadline for electioneering and polling to stop, Macron was heading to Figeac in the Lot department in south-west France for a final rally. Macron will need to beat Le Pen by a considerable margin if he is to argue he has a mandate for his programme, whose most controversial measure includes raising the official retirement age – a policy that has already caused lengthy national strikes and protests. Although Le Pen’s campaign team have been hammering home the message that Macron was “arrogant and disdainful” towards her in Wednesday’s live debate, the voters appear to think otherwise. A poll after the face-off that lasted almost three hours found a majority of those asked found him the most convincing. The biggest challenge for both candidates will be to catch reluctant floating voters who supported other candidates, particularly those on the left and specifically the 7.7m who chose Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round and who will be tempted to abstain or cast a blank vote. A major uncertainty going into the weekend of the vote is the potential level of abstention. Almost a quarter of the eligible population failed to vote in the first round two weeks ago and many of those politically orphaned by the result are unlikely to have their arms twisted into voting for either of two candidates they dislike. Around one-third of Mélenchon voters have said they will stay at home on Sunday. On Friday, Le Pen urged people to “get up and make your choice: Emmanuel Macron or France?” she tweeted. On Sunday, the polls will open at 8am and close at 7pm across most of France and 8pm in major cities. Voting opens on Saturday in France’s overseas territories.",News/World news,French election polls suggest Macron pulling away from Le Pen on last day of campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/french-election-polls-suggest-macron-pulling-away-from-le-pen-on-last-day-of-campaign
4/22/2022,"Good morning. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia of planning to hold a sham independence referendum in the partly occupied southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The Ukrainian president told residents there to avoid handing over personal information, including giving passport data or by answering questionnaires, to occupying forces. Zelenskiy’s warning came after Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boichenko, accused Moscow of concealing evidence of its “barbaric” war crimes in a new mass grave of up to 9,000 civilians killed by shelling. The allegations were supported by satellite images from the US company Maxar. How many Mariupol residents have been killed? Boichenko estimated the death toll has passed 20,000. A Russian military official has been quoted saying that Moscow intends to control all of southern Ukraine, according to the Interfax news agency. The US has dismissed Russian claims that it had seized full control of Mariupol as “disinformation”. Donald Trump Jr has agreed to meet with the House select committee investigating the 6 January attack on the US Capitol, according to the New York Times. The Former president Donald Trump’s eldest son will meet with the committee of his own free will and without the threat of a subpoena, the newspaper reported, citing a source familiar with the matter. It did not say when when the testimony was scheduled. The development follows the testimony of other Trump family members. Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, who was one of his senior White House advisers, testified for eight hours earlier this month days after Jared Kushner, her husband and former White House adviser, appeared before the committee. Was Ivanka Trump subpoenaed? No – she attended voluntarily. How many witnesses have been interviewed? More than 800. Republicans in Florida have moved to seriously undermine Black voting power with one of the most aggressively gerrymandered maps passed in recent months. In protest at the map’s approval, drawn by Governor Ron DeSantis, Black lawmakers staged a sit-in on the floor of the legislature. It boosts Republican chances in the state, while scrapping two of four districts where Black voters have been able to elect the candidate of their choice. The plan breaks up the fifth congressional district, which runs from Jacksonville to Tallahassee and is 46% Black and represented by a Black Democrat, Al Lawson. The map divides the district into four pieces, all in which Republicans would be favoured to win. Voting rights experts have said the plan flouts laws designed to protect the interests of minority voters. How much would it boost the GOP? Republicans would be expected to win 20 of the state’s 28 congressional districts, up from the 16 they hold. How can it be challenged? Lawsuits challenging the maps are expected imminently. Thousands of Maasai people in northern Tanzania have appealed to the UK, the US and the EU for help to halt plans to evict them from their ancestral land. More than 150,000 Maasai people face eviction by the Tanzanian government because of plans by Unesco and a safari company to use the land for conservation and commercial hunting. Democracy will “wither” unless tech firms are reined in, former president Barack Obama has warned in a keynote speech about the threat of online disinformation. Speaking at Stanford University, Obama made his most forceful remarks yet on the perils of the technology landscape. The French army has claimed to have filmed Russian mercenaries burying bodies in northern Mali in order to falsely accuse France’s departing forces of leaving behind mass graves. The French general staff warned of information warfare as its troops withdrew from the base after almost a decade. Vaccine coverage among American kindergarteners fell from 95% to below 94% in the past year – meaning 350,000 fewer children were vaccinated against common diseases. The fall in coverage is yet another hidden cost of the pandemic. The data, from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, showed that a further 400,000 children were absent from kindergarten during 2020-2021. On the morning of his 31st birthday, Wilfred Chan received an unusual email. First of all, it was from himself; secondly, it had taken a decade to arrive. Using an email service called FutureMe, Chan had written the message at 21, laying out his hopes for the future (“You better be a baller by this time,” he jokes). But his younger self offer up words of wisdom too: “I just hope you’re … not losing your sense of wonder about the world.” A heartwarming Friday read!

4/22/2022,"Even before the pandemic, some people were stocking up on essential items such as food and toilet roll, in anticipation of supply chain disruptions wrought by Brexit or a fundamental civilisational collapse. Some stockpiled candles, matches and logs, and bought a wind-up radio for keeping in touch with the news. Others installed freezers and shelving in outbuildings in which to store food, and shifted a proportion of their savings into overseas accounts. So, how did these “preppers” fare once Covid-19 hit the UK, and are they still stockpiling items today? We asked some to offer a glimpse inside their larder. I started building a store of food, after reading there may be problems with fresh goods coming into the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It started out as not wanting to run out of things that my little one likes: at the time it was specifically olives, sun-dried tomatoes and tinned tomatoes for making spaghetti bolognese – all thought to be things potentially affected by Brexit. But it expanded to most of our common foods, as well as extra bottles of Calpol and household items. Having a stock of store cupboard ingredients came in handy when Covid hit. As a non-driver, a single parent and a nurse, I didn’t have the time or the means to keep going to the shops to look for sold-out essentials. When my son and I caught Covid last September, I didn’t feel well enough to cook, so had to order in tins of soup and other easy bits and pieces. I now keep a stock of these things in case of illness. I think given the potential volatility of “just in time” delivery systems, the conflict in Ukraine and the worsening climate emergency it is important to have a safety net for difficult times. I’ve expanded my “stockpiling” into growing my own fruit and veg with heirloom seeds, and hope to seed save this year. The future could be difficult, and Covid has shown that the government will largely leave us to it in times of crisis. I’ve always had a secondary interest in basic survival and prepping. Nothing extreme, just a bug-out-bag containing anything that I might need in case we have to leave the house in an emergency (lights, radio, crank-up phone chargers, cooking utensils), and some preparedness for likely scenarios that could force us to leave London in a jiffy, like a “dirty bomb” on the city, economic meltdown, a flash-flood or a pandemic. Roughly a year before Brexit was imminent, we started slowly stocking up long-term foods, especially when they were temporarily discounted, and rotated the stock to avoid it going off. We had two large boxes: one long-term in the garage and one shorter term under the staircase, plus some meat in the freezer. Then Covid happened and our Brexit boxes became Covid boxes. We carefully avoided panic-buying or reacting emotionally to any news. Any shortage was properly shock-absorbed by the stockpile and we would replenish it later. I’ve added some more things over time, but not directly because of the pandemic. For instance, I replaced my disposable BBQs with a nice camping-hob with gas canisters when I realised that, in case we get the electricity cut off, we need to make hot water. Stockpiling, done rationally and properly planned, is a great way to save money – you buy food on last month’s or last year’s prices, or bulk-buy on sales – and feel incredibly smug. I’ve been hoarding food, water, medical essentials and general survival gear since I watched the film The Road about 15 years ago, in which a man struggles to survive in a post-apocalyptic world with his son. It chilled my blood, how awful a scenario like that would be. I have enough water for a week, and then water filters and cleansers. I have enough food for six months, and some extras that would last longer: sugar, oil, salt. I have a great array of legally obtained medicines. I have to rotate it and manage it all so it doesn’t go out of usefulnesses. I’ve had to move house three times with it all, which was no fun, but when the pandemic hit I was so glad of it. I had been told not to leave the house because I was high risk for Covid, but I couldn’t get any food delivered. I couldn’t ask friends to risk illness for me, so I survived on my stockpile, eating mostly peanut butter on oatcakes, tinned fruit and soup until I could get a priority delivery. I lived without bread for six weeks. The supermarkets were totally unprepared and unhelpful. I am severely disabled and without my hoarding I would have been completely stuck. Everyone should prep. I have always read a lot of post-apocalyptic books and although I totally understand these are works of fiction, what I couldn’t get out of my head was what would happen at a society level if there was a pandemic. I started “prepping” when swine flu happened, I also kept track of any epidemics including Ebola, and rotating my 30-day food source, brought a generator and always kept petrol in our garage. Most people thought I was mad. I am a middle-class woman in a senior role and don’t fit the stereotype of a prepper. I got very worried about Covid when reading news of a new virus in China. Very early on I was wearing a mask on my commute, and had people laughing at me a lot. I also encouraged everyone to make provisions. Most people ignored me. When Covid got serious I had enough food and water to last over 30 days. We were able to completely isolate ourselves and keep safe. My best moment came when one person I worked with, who had a young child, rang me to say thanks; he had built up some extra supplies after speaking to me, which made a huge difference when the shops ran out in the early days. I worry about Russia now, and the threat of nuclear war. I think mankind would and does act in horrific ways when food or water runs out. I want to protect myself from that as much as possible. I became aware of Covid in late 2019, while in Israel, and decided it looked quite novel, so began prepping once back in England. I had already purchased a caravan to be able to go mobile in September 2019, and purchased a pickup truck in February 2020. I also bought a generator for electricity, and approximately £700 worth of storable food and drink, which I keep in the house, and a deep freezer which was filled up. Also, several metal jerry cans of petrol for the generator. In December 2021, I decided the Ukraine situation was hotting up and, assuming the worst, restocked the depleted supplies – mainly tins, packets of flour, etc, plus refilled the deep freezer. I also bought more jerry cans, so now have four x 20 litres of diesel and four x times 20 litres of petrol. I have a large first-aid kit, self-heating meals, medicines, 500 litres of chlorinated water, a portable gas heater and camping gas stove – both with full bottles of fuel, survival bags and foil blankets, and various other survival items including a Bear Grylls knife. Everything purchased or stored is movable at short notice, using the truck and caravan, plus my son’s car.",News/Society,‘Everyone should prep’: the Britons stocking up for hard times,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/22/everyone-one-should-prep-the-britons-stocking-up-for-hard-times
4/22/2022,"It was in a food market in Oaxaca, Mexico – and after eating a particularly memorable plate of black beans with waxy, yellow potatoes at the end of a day’s hiking in the mountains – that Susan Young found herself falling hard for beans. She had seen them growing in fields and sold dried, and witnessed how embedded the bean was in Mexican culture and cuisine. So she bought a few back home to Monmouthshire – and before she knew it, a few beans turned into an obsession. Young grows beans in her garden specifically to shell and eat either fresh, as demi-sec (semi-dried, with a unique flavour) or dried. She favours varieties from Europe: cassoulet beans from France, the borlotti of Italy, the mongeta and alubias from Spain, brown beans from the Netherlands, mottled beauties from southern Germany and cherry types from eastern Europe. She is so passionate about the power of the bean to change our diet and help the environment that she has written a book on the subject, guiding us from sowing to harvesting and cooking. Beans are very good for your health. They are an appreciable source of protein (25-29%, depending on the variety); they’re rich in soluble and insoluble fibre, which promotes digestive health, and they’re packed with vitamins and minerals, notably iron and B vitamins. White beans are full of calcium, making them excellent for vegans. All of these things together make for many health benefits, from helping prevent heart disease, colon and bowel cancer to helping maintain low blood sugar levels. And they are good for the planet, too. Bean plants work with the soil bacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which plants can’t access, into a form that plants can use. In short, they make their own plant food, which means that they can be grown in low-nitrogen soils without additional fertiliser. If you leave the roots in the ground, rather than digging them up after harvesting, any leftover nitrogen will be released back into the soil. Around the world, shelling or dried beans are an important – and ancient – staple crop. It’s thought that beans were domesticated about 7,000 years ago in South America. Beans have been passed along indigenous trade routes and taken by colonial invaders across seas, then handed down through generations to create a great diversity of pulses. They run the gamut of size, shape and colour as well as flavour and texture: beans that taste almost meaty, are spicy or delicate, keep their shape when boiled, and those that blend into soups and stews. Beans fall into two main species: Phaseolus coccineus, which we know as the runner bean; and Phaseolus vulgaris, the French bean. Traditionally in the UK we grow both, but we’ve always stopped short of growing them to maturity, eating only the immature green bean. We seem not to have had a tradition of dried beans (other than broad beans and peas). Finally, they are very easy to grow. There’s still enough time this spring: you can sow into the beginning of May with the aim of planting out by June (any later and you risk the beans not fattening enough). You can sow direct, but if there are any mice around, they’ll eat the beans before they germinate. Sowing in small, 9cm pots means you can keep them somewhere safe until they have germinated, by which point the mice have lost interest. Sow two seeds per pot; when both seedlings are up, remove the weaker one. If you are somewhere cooler, it’s worth pre-warming the soil with plastic sheeting or cloches for at least two weeks. So, after sowing seeds, cover the soil where you’ll plant out. Beans grow well in containers and pots as long as they are deep enough for their substantial root run: something the size of a dustbin. Seeds germinate at 15-25C in eight to 10 days, so it often makes sense to sow indoors if the weather is erratic. Plant out when all chance of frost has gone and the plant has two sets of true leaves. If you’re short on space, or growing somewhere exposed or windy, concentrate on dwarf varieties, which ripen quickly. Tall beans will need something to climb up – a tipi, a bean row or a pergola. Spacing between plants is important for two reasons: so the plants’ deep roots aren’t in competition and get adequate moisture for good swelling; and for air circulation around the beans, necessary for good drying. Dwarf beans should be planted 15-30cm apart in blocks: the larger the bean, the more space the plant needs. Climbing beans need more like 30-45cm between them. All varieties need sunny spots and dislike heavy, wet soils. If you have the latter, plant on mounded soil to improve drainage. All beans can be eaten as green beans first (though some taste much better than others), then as fresh shelling beans and finally as dried. Fresh shelling beans are to be savoured as the flavour is exquisite: borlotti or Greek gigantes beans, for instance, are delicious simply boiled and dressed with lemon, salt and olive oil. Harvest when the beans are well developed but the pods are still green. They will cook quickly, like fresh peas. Demi-sec beans are when the pods have just started to change colour, but are not yet dry. The beans will take a bit longer to cook, but demi-sec beans freeze very well. When the pod rattles and is completely dry, you’re well on your way to harvesting dry beans. The beans may need to dry further before storage (you shouldn’t be able to press your thumbnail into their skin), but will store like this for a very long time; they will have to be soaked before cooking. You will need five to seven plants per variety for two people; 10 plants if you want beans to store for winter. Greek gigantes are wonderful runner beans with huge, fat seeds; they need plenty of space between plants. They are as excellent fresh as they are dried. Hungarian rice bean is a very small dwarf variety with beans not much larger than a grain of rice. Thrives in a sheltered, sunny spot. Can be eaten as a green bean, fresh or dried. Best for containers. Yin yang or orca bean, originally from the Caribbean, this dwarf bean has a very good flavour and works particularly well in stews, where it will keep its shape. Can be eaten as a green bean or dried. Borlotto bean (“fagiolo di Lamon”) is the best of the borlotti, with sweet, nutty flavour and dense texture that can thicken soups or be eaten fresh, cooked with no more than herbs, oil and lemon juice. It’s vigorous, but needs a good, long summer to ripen. Anellino di Trento is a dwarf borlotto that is better for smaller spaces or those further north. Excellent green as well as dried. Beefy Resilient Grex is prolific and reliable, with a deep meaty flavour (hence the name). It’s a dwarf cross between a Gaucho bean and a tepary. It does as well in a dry summer as in a wet one. Brown Dutch is a vigorous dwarf bean that is very productive. It has small, oval, golden-brown beans that soften easily, with a delicate, slightly sweet flavour. Perfect for soups. Best if space is limited. Goût de Chataigne d’Echenans comes from eastern France and is a vigorous, early-cropping climber with rich brown, green and purplish beans that taste distinctly of chestnut. Black turtle is a very pretty bean with a deep lilac flower, originally from Mexico. There are both dwarf and climbing varieties; choose the dwarf if you live further north. Can be eaten as a green bean, but best left to mature into inky black beans, which are rich in antioxidants. Growing Beans by Susan Young (Permanent Publications, £9.95).

4/22/2022,"Every morning I wake up slightly surprised that I still have a beard. It’s been there on my face for more than a decade, but I still don’t think of myself as being in any way committed to it. That’s because nothing about a beard involves commitment; I got it by doing nothing, and I could get rid of it tomorrow. Mostly, I don’t think about it. But when I do stop to consider it, I have to wonder how many favours it’s doing me. It certainly makes me look older, although shaving it off wouldn’t necessarily make me look younger: the face beneath hasn’t stopped ageing, and the last time I saw it – briefly, last summer – I was shocked by the settled weight of my expression. So the beard came back, only greyer this time. Which is better? A beard takes months to fill in. How could you even begin to compare the two looks, one against the other? For years I tried to have a beard without being a beard guy; I got rid of it for work and passport photos. I didn’t want to be considered part of the fashion for beards that was well underway by the time I stopped shaving, or to become unrecognisable without one, the way some people are without their glasses. Above all, I didn’t want to decide. Privately, though, I’m beginning to ask myself the question some trend-spotters have been asking for a while: after all this time, why is the beard still here? Through history facial hair fashions have surged and receded: beards were out for most of the 18th century, very much in for the second half of the 19th, and out again by the dawn of the 20th. Their return in the 1960s and early 70s was short-lived; the tide went out pretty quickly. If you had asked me in 1985, I’d have said the beard was extinct. Then again, I’d have said the same thing about the hat. The latest vogue for beard-wearing began around the 2008 recession, and was initially dismissed as a niche pursuit, a hipster thing. The death of the beard has been announced many times since. The first time the Guardian heralded the arrival of “peak beard” – the point after which the fashion would tail off – was in July 2013. My colleague Emine Saner cited what was then considered the beard’s high-water mark: the 2013 Oscars, when Ben Affleck, George Clooney, Bradley Cooper and Paul Rudd all had beards. The hipster fashion had gone mainstream – even Jeremy Paxman grew a beard that year – so naturally was on the way out. The peak of peak beard reports actually came a year later, in spring 2014, with a study from the University of New South Wales called “Negative frequency-dependent preferences and variation in male facial hair”. It appeared to show that beards were an advantage in sexual selection when their prevalence was low, but that ubiquity made them less attractive. “The bigger the trend gets, the weaker the preference for beards and the tide will go out again,” Robert Brooks, one of the authors, said at the time. “We may well be at peak beard.” Yet, despite these pronouncements, the beard endured. In 2017, YouGov research showed that between 2011 and 2016, the proportion of British men sporting some facial hair had risen from 37% to 42%. Razor sales continued to slide. The hipster came and went, but the beard persisted. Any signs of the beard finally fading were obscured by the pandemic. Underneath the masks, beards were everywhere. At first this was a little depressing: the beards seemed to be an outward manifestation of nothing mattering any more. But men were also liberated from societal expectations, and free to try something new. BBC weatherman Tomasz Schafernaker caused a stir when he decided to keep his long hair and beard post-lockdown. So has our attitude shifted permanently? “The beard used to be a signifier of having let go,” says Teo van den Broeke, GQ’s style and grooming director. “If someone had a beard in a film, unless they were working in the great outdoors, they’d given up really. I don’t think that’s the case any more.” Before we consider why the beard doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, we should ask where it came from. The post-recession fashion for facial hair has certain parallels with the Victorian “beard movement”, which ended a clean-shaven era that had lasted more than a century. “Beards and moustaches are rising on every side of us,” read an 1853 newspaper article, “and we seem in a fair way of being as hairy as our ancestors”. What suddenly changed? “In the 1850s it was to do with fears among men about what was happening to masculinity,” says Dr Alun Withey, author of Concerning Beards: Facial Hair, Health and Practice in England 1650-1900. “Think of the Industrial Revolution: there’s lots of guys having to work together in new ways and new places: offices, factories. There are calls by women for more rights and more power, and there’s a feeling in the air that manliness is being diminished.” In search of some kind of timeless expression of masculinity, men didn’t have to look far – soldiers returning from Crimea, along with a new breed of Victorian explorer, offered a ready symbol of male heroism: a massive beard. At the time, promoters offered pseudoscientific justifications – beards were healthy; they acted as a natural filter, protecting the wearer’s throat, lungs and even teeth. But the fashion grew out of a collective male insecurity that periodically reasserts itself. “You could argue that, in a way, we’re looking at similar concerns today,” says Withey. In fluid times, men tend to anchor themselves with pretty obvious symbols. Alongside the hipster beard came a fashion for utilitarian workwear. Men who toiled at social media startups began dressing like lumberjacks. “The movement was a bit aligned with normcore, I guess,” says van den Broeke. “Really caring about individual products and being a bit nerdy about them: the Red Wing boot, or a certain type of selvedge denim made in Japan.” The Victorian beard movement began to dissipate in the 1870s, but facial hair didn’t disappear; it diversified. In late-19th-century America, streetcar tickets were printed with illustrations of five male faces: clean-shaven, side-whiskered, moustachioed, goateed and fully bearded. Conductors clipped the face most closely resembling the passenger to prevent the ticket being passed on. “I often see a period of ridicule, quickly followed by a market,” says Withey. “You get the initial thing of: why are they doing this? Why do they want to look like animals? Then as it becomes more popular, it becomes: I wonder if we could sell them this?” In the early 20th century the Gillette safety razor – and its massive advertising campaign – sold men a culture of daily shaving as a marker of masculinity. The unruliness of the 21st-century hipster beard may have been its point, but it, too, was tamed by marketing. When sales of shaving products slumped, brands looked elsewhere. “Suddenly, there were a lot of beard oils and waxes and all that kind of stuff,” says van den Broeke. “And this whole surge in barbers focused on beard management. That, for me, was the moment the beard became less a slovenly thing, and more like a Furby or a Tamagotchi, something you have to look after.” I first grew a beard in late 2011, after I got punched in the street by a stranger and had a rectangular wound above my top lip; the imprint, I think, of a ring. I couldn’t really shave until it healed, and after three weeks I’d passed the point of dishevelment into something that resembled intent. I’d never tried to grow a beard before – believe it or not, I don’t get punched in the face that often – and I was surprised by the success of it. Above all, it cost me nothing, not even effort. I had discovered the point where sloth meets affectation, and I was happy there. There was, I should also point out, not an ounce of daring in my decision. In 2011, on the advancing slopes of peak beard, having facial hair made you almost invisible. It attracted very little comment. Even my wife hardly seemed to notice the change. In those early weeks only my youngest son, then about 12, mentioned it. “Dad,” he said. “Are you actually trying to grow an actual beard?” “I don’t know,” I said, stroking the chin part, a mannerism I’d been rehearsing in secret. “How do I look with it?” “You look like a freak,” he said. “You look like a hippy from the 1980s.” “Hippies are from the 60s,” I said. “Whatever,” he said. Within a few years I was being given beard oil for Christmas, and had to accept that friends and family had begun to think of me as a bearded person. I also learned that a beard required maintenance. At the very least you’ve got to keep cutting out a mouth hole so you can eat. I’ve shaved it off in disgust a few times in the past five years – sometimes the straggly feeling gets to be too much, especially in summer – but it always grows back. The routine of shaving just seems so oppressive and, these days, unnecessary. Beards are still normal, so who cares? But how does this all end? Is the demise of the beard, so long predicted, just round the corner, or have cultural trends now become atomised to the extent that we’ll be obliged to live with all of them, simultaneously, in perpetuity? Van den Broeke is willing to bet that the beard has finally lost its relevance. “There are far fewer beardy looks than before. Everyone is very clean-shaven,” he says. “It kind of aligns with the more 80s flamboyant haircuts. There are a lot of mullets around. They don’t work with beards.” Withey more or less agrees. “If history tells us anything, it’s that at some point it’ll change,” he says. “It may be that we go back to clean-shaven, and there’s another facial hair movement further down the line. But this stuff is seldom for ever.” We may even see something akin to the retreat of the Victorian beard: a diversification into specialist forms – moustaches, goatees, long, wide sideboards. Every time I’ve trimmed my beard since the start of lockdown (I use dog clippers; they’re heavy duty, and nowhere do the instructions say “dogs only”) I’ve thought about getting rid of it. It is greyer than ever, and possibly less flattering than whatever it was now hiding. Despite my best efforts, a decision was looming. “They say that facial hair is makeup for men; I think there’s a certain truth in that,” says van den Broeke. “You don’t have to commit to it forever.” “That’s the nice thing about beards, they’re slightly prosthetic,” says Alun Withy. “I often think if you’ve made the decision to shave a full beard off, try a couple of styles on the way. Give yourself a brilliant biker’s moustache.” At the Mühle barbershop in London, Oran Lasocki is patiently scraping a vertical line down the centre of my chin with a straight razor, while I lie back and keep very, very still. The beard is going and the style I’m trying on the way is half-and-half. Afterward Oran wraps my face in a hot towel, but it only feels hot on one side. He applies some kind of balm, which only stings on one side. Then, with very little ceremony, he tilts the chair upright. What I see in the mirror is deeply disturbing. It’s impossible to gauge how much volume a beard adds to your face until you’ve viewed yourself in cross-section – one side bushy, the other pale and diminished. There is no point in asking which side looks better, or younger. The overwhelming picture is one of freakish contrast: half mountain man, half turtle. Thank God for mask mandates, I think, on my way home.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Are you a beard guy?

4/22/2022,"The industrialization of agriculture in the last century boosted production around the world – but that success also made our food systems much more vulnerable to the growing climate crisis. Modern agriculture depends on high-yield monocrops from a narrow genetic base that needs lots of fertilisers, chemicals and irrigation. But why does this matter? Because a richer genetic diversity of foods, like we had in the past, will help make our crops more resilient to higher temperatures and changing rainfall patterns. Like an investor with stocks, savings and real estate, diversity in the field spreads the risk: so if an early season drought wipes out one crop, there will be others which mature later or are naturally more drought tolerant, so farmers aren’t left with nothing. Here are five key graphics from our recent special report on the precariousness of our modern food system. Maize or corn is now grown in greater volume than any crop in history, and is still the staple food for about 1.2 billion people in Latin America, the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa. Historically, it spread around the world because of its ability to evolve and adapt to different climates, altitudes and day lengths, and people enjoyed purple, blue, black and orange varieties which all tasted a bit different. Scientists in the 20th century then discovered they could take a locally adapted variety of corn, called landraces or heirlooms, and self-pollinate the plant, creating a genetically identical inbred. And if they did this several times its characteristics would change – perhaps the plant would be taller or have a big ear of corn. These inbreds were then crossed with each other, again and again, to create hybrids. Hybrid seeds, which farmers have to replace every year, contributed to a huge increase in yield but at the expense of genetic diversity and qualities such as taste, nutrition and climate adaptability. In the blink of an evolutionary eye, Mexico lost 80% of its varieties, and 99% of corn grown in the US today is from hybrid seeds. The threat to food from climate crisis is not just a fear, it’s happening now. In Asia, rice fields are being flooded with saltwater; cyclones have wiped out vanilla crops in Madagascar; in Central America higher temperatures ripen coffee too quickly; drought in sub–Saharan Africa is withering chickpea crops; and rising ocean acidity is killing oysters and scallops in American waters. In 1961, this is how many calories people in the United States consumed from various food items each day. Meanwhile, people in China ate some of the same foods. But the overlap between the two countries’ diets was small. But around 40 years ago something else started happening: from country to country, the overlap in our diets started to grow. Over the next half-century, this list got longer. People began eating a larger variety of foods across the world. Let’s take wheat, the world’s most widely consumed grain which is grown in every continent (apart from the Antarctic) to make bread, chapattis, pasta, noodles, pizza and biscuits. It feeds billions but it is vulnerable to climate changes. Last year prices for durum (pasta) wheat soared by 90% after widespread drought and unprecedented heatwaves in Canada, one of the world’s biggest grain producers, followed a few months later by record rainfall. Over the last century, Canadian farmers have increasingly relied on genetically similar high yield wheat varieties, elbowing out crucial diversity. Then there’s one of the world’s favorite stimulants. Whether you prefer espresso or instant, our coffee comes from just two species: arabica and robusta. Smooth tasting, high quality arabica accounts for about two-thirds of consumption and is struggling to cope with the changing climate. Robusta, which is hardier with more caffeine and higher yields, has a bitter, grainy flavor. Wild arabica coffee is native to the forested mountains of Ethiopia and South Sudan, but the coffee we enjoy in our lattes and flat whites today can be traced back to just two sets of arabica plants snuck out of Yemen in the early 17th century. Its future now hangs in the balance. Arabica grows at 1,300 to 2,000 meters (4,200 to 6,500 ft) above sea level and is very fussy about temperature, rainfall and humidity. When it’s too hot and dry, coffee ripens too quickly which diminishes yield and quality. Our arabica doesn’t like it to be too wet or too windy either – which is a major problem for coffee growing regions prone to hurricanes such as the Caribbean, Hawaii and Vietnam. As the climate rapidly changes, higher temperatures, erratic rainfall and more aggressive pathogens could render 50% of current arabica growing regions unsuitable by 2050. As the clock ticks, the private sector is forging ahead with developing biotech solutions such as gene editing and transgenics, which rely on genetic resources in publicly funded gene banks and naturally occurring biodiversity to provide the raw material. Just four agrochemical companies control 60% of the global seed market (and 75% of the pesticides market), and so have a vested interest in making farmers dependent on them for the full shebang. Not all is lost. As the Green Revolution fueled the erosion of genetic biodiversity, it also triggered an organized global effort to find and conserve diversity in gene or seed banks. In the end, though, we need to see greater diversity in farmers’ fields, where old varieties can once again be part of the evolutionary story.

4/22/2022,"The rare sighting of an all-white humpback whale off the coast of New South Wales has sparked speculation it could be the offspring of beloved albino Migaloo. Brayden Blake, a 16-year-old teenager, spotted the white whale just off the coast of Fingal Head in north-east NSW while holidaying on Thursday. “I was out for a paddle and a surf with my friend out the back … I was on my board … then fell in the water and heard this weird singing or screaming noise,” he said. “It was kind of spooky, so I ran up [on to the beach], and because I do surf life saving I knew the lady working [there] and she was like – ‘turn around, there’s a whale’. “But it didn’t look like one, it was all white.” Blake raced back home to grab his personal drone, and when he returned – “there it was” – a white humpback, flapping its tail with a pod of dolphins. “I’ve seen regular humpback whales before, but this one didn’t look at all the same. Every time it came back for a breath of air, it was white,” Blake said. Instantly Blake thought of Migaloo, the famous white humpback whale named from an Aboriginal word for “whitefella”, who has captured the imaginations of Australians for decades. The whale was first photographed passing Byron Bay in June 1991 and was the only documented all-white humpback in the world until 2011, when an all-white calf was filmed. Years after his first sighting, DNA samples of Migaloo confirmed he was born around 1986. A genetic fingerprint, obtained at the time, allows researchers to check for relatives of Migaloo and whether he is the father to calves. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I’ve seen some footage of Migaloo before, and always thought it was cool but never thought about seeing one in real life because they’re so rare, chances are very low,” Blake said. “Where I was on Fingal Head – it’s not a crowded beach area, so it was just me, lifeguards and a couple of bystanders. As soon as I saw it, I got some of my friends to come down and have a look and they were like – ‘wow, once in a lifetime’.” Blake said the figure had the same shape as a regular humpback whale, with a grey tail and grey dorsal fins. But it was slightly smaller than usual, which got him thinking it may be an offspring of Migaloo. In total, he and his mates spent 20 minutes watching the white whale dance in the water – flapping its tail before diving deep and spinning into the air. “It was really cool to see, very special,” he said. Dr Vanessa Pirotta, a wildlife scientist, said she was sure the whale wasn’t Migaloo, as while it was completely white underneath the top of its tail was a normal colouring, and it was smaller. “I don’t know what’s happened to it,” she said. “It makes me think it’s not albino … we do see variation in the appearances of humpback whales on the east coast, some might appear to have more colouration than others, while some may appear to be more white. “But it’s very exciting, and the animal is very playful with the dolphins.” Pirotta also reasoned that, with more than 40,000 humpback whales in the sea, it would be tricky to tell simply by looking at it whether it were a relative of Migaloo. But she agreed it was a “completely weird-looking whale”. “I’ve been watching whales for many years, and I’ve not seen a whale that looks like that other than Migaloo,” she said. “This is a great opportunity for us to learn more about this population – especially as it’s the start of the migration period.” As for the whale’s fate? The last time Blake saw it, the humpback was headed up north, towards the Gold Coast. Perhaps in search of its mate.",News/Australia news,‘Completely weird-looking’: rare all-white whale spotted off the coast of New South Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/22/completely-weird-looking-rare-all-white-whale-spotted-off-the-coast-of-new-south-wales
4/22/2022,"Simon Arora, the billionaire co-owner and chief executive of B&M, the discount chain that cemented its place as one of Britain’s most successful retailers during the pandemic, is to retire. The 52-year old, who runs the business with co-owner Bobby with involvement to a lesser extent from youngest sibling Robin, is to stand down early next year after 18 years running the chain. Simon and brother Bobby, 50, acquired the business from Phildrew Investments in late 2004 when it was an ailing regional chain of 21 stores and built it into a retail empire of 1,100 shops in the UK and France. It is listed on the FTSE 100 with a market value of more than £5bn. The retailer, which sells everything from food to toys, DIY supplies and gardening products, has more than 600 stores in the UK and a further 500 in France. The brothers are estimated to be worth £2.5bn. “Having firmly established a strong, entrepreneurial culture and built a talented and experienced senior management team, Simon wishes to plan for retirement,” the company said in a statement on Friday. In January, SSA Investments, the family office of the Arora brothers sold shares worth £234m, having sold a stake worth £214m a year earlier. The family still owns a 7% stake in the business, which listed on the Londonstock market in 2014. Brother Bobby will remain as group trading director while Robin has a seat on the board. Simon has previously described the family’s background as the “classic immigrant story”. His father emigrated to the UK from New Delhi in the 1960s with “£10 in his pocket” and went on to set up several businesses and “what money he made he spent on educating his kids”. “He also loved talking to his sons about business and commerce, and he filled us with ambition and self-confidence.” Simon studied law at Cambridge and his early career included a stint at the management consultancy McKinsey. Bobby went straight into the family cash-and-carry business after school. Before hitting the big time with B&M, the brothers, who grew up in Sale, Manchester, had already enjoyed success. In the 1990s they established a successful wholesale business, Orient Sourcing, which imported cheap homewares for high street chains, eventually selling it for £30m. Acknowledged as one of the retail sector’s “pandemic winners”, B&M thrived during the crisis when its stores were granted “essential” retailer status and allowed to stay open through multiple lockdowns. Its low prices and out-of-town locations struck a chord with shoppers, who spend more than £4bn a year in its stores, and it is expected to continue to fare well as the cost of living crisis hits consumer spending. The success during the pandemic saw the brothers and other shareholders receive hundreds of millions in dividend pay outs as profits soared. The retirement of the eldest brother will bring to an end an immensely successful two-decade business relationship with brother Bobby. “There’s a Punjabi saying from our childhood that we both believe in: ‘One plus one equals 11’,” Simon has said of the relationship. “Bobby has been shoulder to shoulder with me throughout my business career, and I do believe we have both been more effective by virtue of that relationship.” “We like to keep it simple,” Simon has said of the B&M formula for success. “We sell name brands that our customers recognise; we have direct sourcing, so there’s no middleman; and we have good retail standards.” The company said on Friday that chair Peter Bamford would lead the process to find a new chief executive, and would consider both internal and external candidates. Shares fell 6% after the announcement, making B&M the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 on Friday morning.",News/Business,"B&M boss, Simon Arora, to step down from discount chain",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/22/bm-boss-simon-arora-to-step-down-from-discount-chain
4/22/2022,"Boris Johnson loyalists have hit out at Conservative MPs calling for the prime minister to resign in the wake of an investigation being launched into whether the prime minister lied to parliament. Conor Burns, a Northern Ireland minister, said there was no question of Johnson resigning over Partygate and the prime minister would “rebuild the bonds of trust with the British people”. After an astonishing day in Westminster during which the government capitulated to allow a third inquiry into Johnson’s Partygate denials, Burns insisted the prime minister had been “straightforward” and acted in “good faith”. But Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the Commons defence select committee, urged colleagues to “take matters into their own hands” and fix once and for all the “absence of discipline, of focus and leadership” in No 10. The tussle looks set to continue while Scotland Yard pursues its investigation into Covid rule-breaking parties in No 10. So far, the police have issued 50 fixed-penalty notices. Dismissing the criticism levelled at Johnson by some of his own backbenchers, Burns said there were “colleagues across parliament who have never really supported the prime minister”. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “If the prime minister stepped off Westminster Bridge and walked on top of the water they would say he couldn’t swim. That is a fact. “The reality is that it is is only two years ago since we won a majority of 80 seats, the biggest majority since Margaret Thatcher in 1987.” He added that Johnson had told MPs “I have got business I want to do” with that large majority. Burns added: “What he has also said is that the events in Downing Street and the fine has actually redoubled his determination to rebuild the bonds of trust with the British people.” He told Sky News there was “no question of the prime minister going” and that Johnson was confident when all investigations had concluded “it will be clear that he was straightforward, he said to the house in good faith that he believed the rules were followed”. Ellwood, meanwhile, urged fellow disgruntled Tory MPs to submit a letter of no confidence in Johnson. A total of 54 letters are needed to trigger a leadership challenge. “There’s a recognition that every MP now realises it’s up to us to take ownership of this,” said Ellwood. “Because, I’m afraid, the absence of discipline, of focus and leadership in No 10 during that lockdown period has led to a huge breach of trust with the British people. “It’s causing such long-term damage to the party’s brand and that’s proving difficult to repair. Can it be repaired in time for the next general election? “So it’s beholden upon all Conservative MPs then to take matters into their own hands, and I think, as I say, I think this is where things will go, particularly as we have more bad news to follow.” Ellwood apologised in December 2020 for giving a speech at a club in central London at an event that was billed by organisers as a “Christmas party” for 27 guests, when no mixing of households indoors was allowed. He said when his attendance at the gathering – organised partly by the Iraqi embassy – emerged that it was “fully Covid-compliant” but understood that “during this challenging time perceptions count”.",News/Politics,Johnson loyalists turn on Tory MPs who called for PM to step down,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/22/boris-johnson-loyalists-turn-on-tory-mps-who-called-for-pm-to-step-down
