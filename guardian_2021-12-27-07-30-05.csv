12/27/2021,"After a testing few weeks, this was exactly the kind of performance that Graham Potter required. Brighton’s first victory after 11 winless Premier League matches, courtesy of two spectacular goals from Leandro Trossard and Neal Maupay in the space of eight minutes, lifted them back into the top half of the table.  While Brentford – who began the game level on points with their opponents – put in a typically committed display that occasionally threatened to spoil Brighton’s party at times, they could have no complaints about the quality of the strikes that did for them here. Both goals were the culmination of a dazzling 10-minute spell from Potter’s side just before half-time which hinted that there could be plenty more to come from this team. The hosts had made four changes to the side that started their last Premier League match, with Potter selecting Adam Lallana as captain in the absence of Lewis Dunk and Adam Webster brought in at the back. Brighton’s search for a first league victory since their 2-1 triumph over Leicester on 19 September had included eight draws, while the previous five matches yielded only two goals. Perhaps that and the late kick-off time were both contributing factors to the number of empty seats there were on an unseasonably mild evening on the south coast. Brentford – who had gone more than two weeks since their last league fixture after a Covid outbreak in the squad – were delighted to welcome back top scorer Ivan Toney as one of five changes, with former Arsenal academy player Dominic Thompson handed his full league debut. Seven points from their previous four league matches have ensured that Thomas Frank’s side are well on course to achieve their objective for this season and they started here like a team full of confidence. A tight offside call against Bryan Mbeumo in the fourth minute after Thompson’s clipped pass forward was a symbol of their attacking intent, with Shandon Baptiste then seeing his goalbound shot deflected wide. Brighton’s lack of cutting edge has always been a major concern for Potter and the closest they came to testing Álvaro Fernández in the opening half hour was a Dan Burn header that looped off the crossbar. Enock Mwepu should have done better with his effort from inside the penalty area but missed by some distance. Even without the suspended Yves Bissouma, however, Brighton began to dominate possession in midfield and almost found a way through on a couple of occasions thanks to some intricate passing moves. Yet it was via a more direct approach that the home crowd was finally brought to life. Mwepu’s ball forward meant Trossard did not have to break stride before dinking the ball over the onrushing Fernández and into the empty net. Trossard also came close shortly afterwards when his free-kick flew just over the crossbar, with Brentford then forced into a change as Mbeumo limped off. Things then got even better for Potter just before half-time when Trossard found Jakub Moder on the left and his driving run infield gave Maupay time and space to curl home his seventh goal of the season. Suddenly Brighton were rampant. Trossard failed to emerge for the second half and was replaced by Danny Welbeck, the former Manchester United and Arsenal forward not having featured since the draw with Crystal Palace in September due to a thigh injury. Brentford also made a change at the break as they tried to find a way back into the contest, with Frank Onyeka brought in an attempt to provide some support for the isolated Toney. Mwepu’s brilliant through ball almost created another opening for Maupay but Brighton’s momentum had stalled and Brentford sensed an opportunity. It took two excellent saves within a minute from Robert Sánchez to maintain their two-goal cushion, with the first denying Baptiste after his shot had taken a wicked deflection. The second was just as good as Sánchez dived to his right and managed to push Ethan Pinnock’s header on to the post. Not to be outdone, his Spanish compatriot Marc Cucurella somehow contrived to avoid the crossbar as he leapt to clear another header from Pinnock that had looped over Sánchez. Brentford continued to show belief that they could set up a grandstand finale but were left frustrated in the end despite their best efforts. With his team coasting towards victory at the end, Potter finally acknowledged the fans as they chanted his name in tribute.",Sport/Football,Brighton end winless run after Trossard and Maupay superbly sink Brentford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/26/brighton-brentford-premier-league-match-report
12/27/2021,"Well NOW it’s Christmas. Sarah Phelps has delivered. Not an Agatha Christie adaptation this time but an original drama, A Very British Scandal (BBC One), about the notorious case of Argyll v Argyll – the only one any erstwhile law student ever remembers (and I speak from experience). This is thanks to the fact that it was a vicious divorce case between the Duke and Duchess of Argyll involving multiple allegations of infidelity, one of which was attested to by a photo of the Duchess fellating a man whose face was not visible in the picture but who was not her husband. The duke had various measurements taken so this could be proved in court. The duchess was identified by her pearl necklace. No, really. It’s surprising that no one has brought the story to the screen before now. Here it is a companion piece – or perhaps furtherance of what seems set to become an anthology series about historical media frenzies, national prurience and social hypocrisy – to 2018’s A Very English Scandal, about the Jeremy Thorpe affair.  The Argyll case (or the ‘Headless Man affair’ as it was also known, thanks to the photo that quickly became infamous) of course provoked a media storm. A Very British Scandal opens in 1963 with the Duchess (Claire Foy, most recently seen on the small screen as the Queen in The Crown and here bringing the same masterful skills to another aristocratic but wholly different character) facing the screaming abuse of a crowd (“Scum!” “Slut!”) as she enters Edinburgh’s court of session to open divorce proceedings. Inside, the Duke of Argyll (Paul Bettany) offers her one last chance to end things quietly “Because I’m an honourable man. You’ve played a spirited game but we both know you haven’t the stomach for this.” The look on the duchess’s face suggests we should all buckle up to enjoy the coming ride. We flash back to 16 years earlier, when committed socialite Margaret Sweeny (nee Whigham, the spoilt only daughter of a fabulously wealthy industrialist) who is rumoured to have had affairs with everyone from David Niven to Prince Ali Khan and is about to divorce her first husband, meets the dashing Captain Ian Campbell, heir to the Argyll title and lands. They find their interests align quite nicely and – once he’s divorced from Louise (his second wife and mother of his two sons) – get hitched. At first it seems a good match, if only in the sense that they are as monstrous and self-involved as each other. Campbell’s father dies, they become the Duke and Duchess, move to the family pile in Inverary and she pays for everything from the restoration of the castle to the final bills for Louise’s fur coats. Fairly soon, though, the duke reveals himself to be a violent, vicious drunk. Margaret’s own essential viciousness serves her well. She remains uncowed by her situation and by the end of the episode we see her forging letters from Louise claiming that Ian’s sons aren’t his, to secure her place at Inverary which would otherwise pass to them. A Very British Scandal has been billed – I suspect because anything involving a woman and sex in The Past must – as a feminist retelling of the Argyll marriage divorce, but in fact Phelps doesn’t lean too hard into that. Yes, there are moments when the likes of shit-stirring frenemy Maureen (Julia Davis, simultaneously lightly and deeply malevolent, as is her special gift) tries to shame her for her sexual appetite. And it is clear all along that hypocrisy abounded and life in the 60s wasn’t nearly as liberated for women as the men then, or history since, would like us to believe. But there is, thankfully – because it would do both Margaret and feminism no favours – no attempt to make us view her through a new, heroic lens. We are invited to admire her fortitude with the social odds stacked against her, which is a different thing. The duchess was never a champion of women – she was a champion of Margaret Campbell and Margaret Campbell alone. Not inviting pity, refusing to kowtow to others’ opinions – these are admirable qualities and Phelps and Foy showcase them magnificently, but they are not specifically feminist. The very public divorce came about because the equally stubborn duke and duchess had their teeth buried in each other’s necks equally firmly and wouldn’t let go. A Very British Scandal, with its lean, mean script and its refusal to reinvent the duchess as an icon of the movement, is the very best and fairest tribute that could be given her.",Arts/Television & radio,A Very British Scandal review – Claire Foy is masterful as the ‘dirty duchess’ out for blood,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/26/a-very-british-scandal-review-claire-foy-is-masterful-as-the-dirty-duchess-out-for-blood
12/27/2021,"There was a routine. Kate Sewell would watch the New South Wales premier’s daily Covid press conference at 11am. During the work day, she kept a browser tab running with a pandemic news live blog. She’d pick up her phone and scroll through posts about masks and lockdowns on social media. And then, on her drive home from her healthcare job in Sydney, maybe listen to a podcast or news radio. She never felt exactly good when she turned off the TV or put down her phone, but maybe there was comfort in the noise. “It was the numbers game,” she says. “Are things going up? Are things going down? Chasing that hope that if the numbers are going down, OK, things are getting better.” The announcement in September that Gladys Berejiklian’s daily press conferences were coming to an end was “a hallelujah moment”, Sewell says.  Information-seeking has become a complex habit to manage during recent years of plague and unrest. For some, both relief and anxiety are found on platforms where work, play and social connection are increasingly blurred. It feels necessary to be informed and prepared, but it’s also easy to fall into the numbing embrace of case rates and vaccination statistics – as if comfort can be found at the bottom of the feed. These habits may be about reducing uncertainty, but Covid-19 has been a rather slow-moving crisis. What we must do to stay safe – wear a mask, stay home, vaccinate – has stayed fairly consistent for months. Yet almost every situation prompts us to “check to see if there’s any more information”, according to Art Markman, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas, who suggests “doom scrolling” during the pandemic has kept us unhelpfully focused on a threat “out there”. The stress provoked by this state can lead to self-medicating behaviours, he says. It may also heighten our attention not only to the threat of the virus, but to every other threat in our environment. It makes sense to have contradictory feelings about news consumption in this climate; to feel swamped on the one hand, and reliant on the other. Sora Park, a professor of communication at the University of Canberra, says her research shows Australians consumed more news during the pandemic, but also avoided news more than before. “They also find it overwhelming … really disturbing and negative and emotional,” Park says. Of course, the media itself plays a part in this – because it delivers the news in constant rolling bulletins, and it has an innate preference for novelty and uncertainty over plodding change. And social media thrives on tension. But even allowing for that, how can we wrestle back some agency? To change a habit you must first pay attention to it. Markman suggests keeping a diary about your media and social media consumption for a week or so, noting all the times you pull up a social media app or open a news website. When are you doing it? How often are you doing it? And how are you feeling when you do it? Of course, it’s difficult to stop doing something habitual. Instead, Markman suggests creating an alternative pattern. Take compulsively checking Twitter. If you feel the need to check the feed, do something else instead. Walk around the room, call a friend – something desirable. “You want to begin to associate that feeling of ‘I need to check the news’ with an action that actually creates some amount of joy,” he says. Some days are always going to be better than others. Mike Caulfield, a researcher into misinformation at the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public, suggests reassessing the way we consume information when our attention is continuously being hijacked. One method he’s devised is known as SIFT, which aims to help us resist the temptation to get to the bottom of everything we see. SIFT stands for “Stop, Investigate, Find better coverage, and Trace claims”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Imagine someone emails you an article that makes a distressing claim about Covid-19 vaccines. First stop and think about what you’re looking at and how you’re feeling. If something provokes a strong emotion, that is often a good reason to be cautious. If you don’t recognise the source of the article, have a quick (really quick) look to see what kind of outlet it is. If you don’t recognise it or something seems off, Caulfield suggests waiting to see if the same information turns up elsewhere – if it’s important, other outlets will almost certainly pick up the story. “People have got themselves into this mode that we can’t disregard anything unless we prove it to be untrue, but that’s entirely backwards,” he says. If small things are off about a claim or a source, it can be enough for us to say, “not today”. Finally, if your interest is sparked, trace claims, quotes and media to the original context to ensure you’re not being misled by the way the information is being framed in the email or on social media. Stevie Zhang is a research reporter for First Draft, an organisation that tracks online misinformation. That means almost all their work is focused on social media platforms, which makes it especially hard to turn away from the deluge. “That’s where you go for your information, where you go to do work,” they say. “The personal, the professional, all the research that we do. There’s not that many boundaries.” Even when your job is to investigate how attention can be manipulated, it can be hard to stop endless information-seeking. Zhang says in the past he and his colleagues were “terminally online”, and would continue to browse online after work hours. But now, once the work day is done, they log off and do not log back on. Zhang has found benefit in more purposeful engagement: email newsletters that serve content on a specific theme, for example – although it’s hard not to subscribe to too many. They also have a Twitter account that’s just for fun, which provides some delineation between work and pleasure. But being more choosy is not the same as being actively uninformed. Some may feel their media habits are a necessary and protective way to move through the world, and others may struggle to find information in the formats and languages they need. Nevertheless, it helps to be intentional about what you take in. Caulfield advocates “tuning” your feed on social media: muting, unsubscribing from or unfollowing people who seem to be pushing dubious information. He acknowledges people can react badly to this idea – as if unsubscribing from someone who repeatedly posts inflammatory things is akin to censorship. But unless it’s your job or you have some greater purpose for understanding them, that argument doesn’t hold much water. “When people speak a lot of nonsense or are careless with the truth, you’ve got to stop dealing with them, or they’ll exhaust you,” he says. “You don’t owe people your attention and you’ve got to take action to reclaim it.” For Sewell, the end of the daily press conferences allowed her to reassess her Covid-19 information consumption. She has closed the live blogs, and instead looks only for what she needs to have informed conversations with family and friends. She is also an advocate of the “unfollow” button – especially since consuming other people’s opinions on every little thing to do with Covid began to feel like work. “When people started coming out of the woodwork with some questionable thoughts on vaccination, that was when it was a good time to say ‘no thank you’.” Ariel Bogle is a researcher and journalist with a focus on technology and extremism.",News/Media,No comfort at the bottom of the feed: how to prevent information overload in the time of Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/27/no-comfort-at-the-bottom-of-the-feed-how-to-prevent-information-overload-in-the-time-of-covid
