3/26/2022,"Moments into Olivia Rodrigo’s documentary Driving Home 2 U, we see her turn on a camera in the shoebox-sized home studio of her producer, Daniel Nigro, state the date – March 2021 – and squirm as he plays the first song they wrote together, a year earlier. “And I’m still not over it!” she says of the relationship documented in the song. She seems less embarrassed by the enduring heartache than with confronting a less refined version of her songwriting – a craft she would hone into 2021’s biggest hit. Drivers License, Rodrigo’s lovelorn debut single, came out on 8 January 2021 and broke the Spotify record for the most one-day streams of any non-Christmas song within four days. “My entire life just shifted in an instant,” Rodrigo says in the film, which seems to exist as much to help the then 18-year-old comprehend that rapid change as to entertain her fans. As well as the studio footage, it shows her road-tripping from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles, the places where she wrote her subsequent debut album, Sour, giving atmospheric performances in diners and deserts along the way. Curiously, it never acknowledges why she was in Utah: Rodrigo is a lead character in Disney’s High School Musical TV series, which shoots there. Although the documentary is produced by the Walt Disney Company, it entirely omits the early part of Rodrigo’s career on two of its shows to frame her narrative purely in terms of her growth as a songwriter. The other unspoken detail in Rodrigo’s film is the pandemic, noticeable only in the dates that pop up onscreen and one scene where she and Nigro wear masks to host two label execs who visit near the end of recording. Arguably, her evolution as a songwriter flourished because cloistered working environments were the only viable way to make music during the height of the Covid-19 crisis – and they were conveniently closed to label interference or the danger of a young voice being crowded out in a busy room. She wasn’t the only songwriter benefiting from these reduced circumstances: Driving Home 2 U makes an interesting companion piece to Charli XCX’s Alone Together, another account of creativity persevering during the pandemic. Within days of California imposing its first stay-at-home order in March 2020, Charli, a self-confessed workaholic, is coming apart. “I’m flailing, doing nothing, I just need to be preoccupied,” she cries, filming herself on her phone. So she sets herself the challenge of making an album within five weeks, a process that might usually take a year, calling it How I’m Feeling Now. What’s more, she intends to document every part of it to let fans feel as involved as possible: right down to holding Zoom writing sessions where she toggles between rhymebrain.com and their suggestions in the comments. Charli’s fraught relationship with her label, Atlantic, over the last decade has been well documented: both parties have vacillated between whether she should be a mainstream pop star or an avant garde influencer who innovates alongside close collaborators such as PC Music figureheads Sophie and AG Cook. Unreconciled to this day (her new album Crash offers a meta take on the matter), that identity flux is presumably what made Atlantic fund this experimental project: it’s entirely in character, and so the risks are lower. You wonder whether the lane Charli has carved out also helped create space for Rodrigo to work with just one producer in his home studio on her own major label debut. Not to mention, too, Beyoncé’s brains-trust process, Billie Eilish’s homespun pop – as documented in her own film, The World’s a Little Blurry – and Ariana Grande staking her claim, in 2018, to “put out music in the way that a rapper does” – ie fast and reactive. Sour was initially meant to be an EP, but Rodrigo told her label Geffen that she was determined to make a full album to document that period of her life. Staying in touch with fresh-wound emotions requires intimacy and speed, not the type of diluting creation-by-committee process that can particularly dog young female pop acts who aren’t trusted with their own work. As New York Times pop music critic Jon Caramanica has often pointed out, major stars have started behaving more like cult acts, understanding that doing so helps them protect their vision and speak directly to an invested audience rather than risking their distinctiveness by trying to please allcomers: at the same time as Rodrigo and Charli were making these records, Taylor Swift was recording a pair of surprise albums at home with a coterie of left-field collaborators (a process that she also documented for Disney). These films have wildly different stakes: Rodrigo’s are more about brand positioning, establishing distance between who she is now and who she used to be: she talks, strikingly, about playing the songs “in these places that meant so much to me and revisiting them with older eyes”, as if she were looking back in her dotage and not from a remove of about 18 months. The focus is on establishing her as a born songwriter, not a “former Disney star”, and dwelling on the emotional consequences of heartbreak rather than the drama she obliquely alludes to that characterised much media coverage of her breakout. It’s fans-only fare, for those who already know the details. Charli’s vérité film has more at risk: will she make her five-week deadline? What’s more, it’s her first time cohabiting with her on-off boyfriend – in seven years, they’ve never spent more than 11 days together. It also coincides with her soliciting a therapist to unpick the toxic relationship between her work and her self-worth at what couldn’t be a more acute moment. Nevertheless, documentation offers both artists, a decade apart in age, a form of protection: women’s agency in the studio is often still undermined, and both films leave no doubt as to Rodrigo and Charli’s authorship and role as equal collaborators. We see Charli setting up equipment and learning how to self-produce as well as writing to beats sent in by the likes of Cook and Palmistry; Rodrigo ad libs to a riff that Nigro coins on a whim and comes up with one of the most beloved songs on her debut album. These appear to be entirely empowered working environments, but having a camera present in the studio also seems like it should be an industry prerequisite, offering a kind of security – particularly for young female artists working with older men – in a space that has historically been open to exploitation. Of the two films, Alone Together is by far the better documentary. Rodrigo’s is hermetically stagey, and the wan interviews undermine her pride in the messy emotional truth of her songs. The closing credits show photos of her larking about with the all-female band that backs her “live” performances, and it’s hard not to crave more of that sort of interaction: a group of girls road-tripping and bonding together, not lonely vignettes of Rodrigo in boilerplate landscapes. Charli’s film offers a wider time capsule of life under lockdown, particularly as she focuses on the experiences of isolated LGBTQ+ fans who find inclusion in her project and fan community. But they’re both appreciably devoid of any drama beyond making a creative deadline. Since the New York Times released Framing Britney Spears in February 2021, a cottage industry has emerged for documentaries that “redeem” female pop cultural icons (or pariahs) of previous eras. And pop stars often turn to their own documentary vehicles when they’re in need of a redemption narrative (especially when they’re managed by Scooter Braun). Refreshingly, neither of these films offer a greater conclusion than: I made an album. Driving Home 2 U doesn’t cure Rodrigo of her heartbreak: “Hopefully I won’t be so sad in the next record,” she tells Nigro when they finish recording. Nor does Alone Together redeem Charli of her workaholism: “Shall we do another one?!” she jokes to her boyfriend and manager when she’s done. Creativity alone is presented as a valid marker of personal evolution. Their triumph lies in working within self-imposed limits, not striving to escape anyone else’s.  Driving Home 2 U is out now on Disney+, Alone Together is in cinemas on 14 April and available on demand from 18 April.",Arts/Music,"Taking back control: Charli XCX and Olivia Rodrigo’s films celebrate craft, not drama",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/25/taking-back-control-charli-xcx-and-olivia-rodrigos-films-celebrate-craft-not-drama
3/26/2022,"The Home Office operated an unlawful, secret, blanket policy to seize almost 2,000 mobile phones from asylum seekers arriving in the UK on small boats and then downloaded data from these phones, the high court has ruled. The court found that the policy was unlawful on multiple fronts and breached the asylum seekers’ human rights. The judges ruled that there was no parliamentary authority for seizures and data extractions and that the legal power that Home Office officials thought they could use was the wrong one. Three asylum seekers brought the case against the home secretary about the unpublished policy demanding the handover of the new arrivals’ phones between April and November 2020. During the case the court heard evidence that asylum seekers were “bullied” into handing over their passcodes so that officials could unlock personal information including emails, photos and videos and download them to an intelligence database called Project Sunshine. The Home Office defended its right to seize the mobile phones, saying that it helped officials gather evidence about the people smugglers who organise such journeys. During the hearing, Sir James Eadie QC acknowledged that the Home Office had breached its duty of candour in relation to initially failing to admit that the unpublished policy to seize phones existed. He said it was “extremely unfortunate” and apologised. The judges have ordered a separate hearing to decide what to do about this breach by the Home Office. The Home Office conceded that the way the seizure policy was previously implemented was unlawful in some respects due to its blanket, unpublished nature. Lawyers representing the three asylum seekers welcomed the ruling. Clare Jennings of Gold Jennings said: “Such systematic extraction of personal data from vulnerable asylum seekers, who were not suspects in any crime, was an astonishing and unparalleled assault on fundamental privacy rights.” Daniel Carey of Deighton Pierce Glynn said: “Nearly 2,000 phones were taken from migrants in an indiscriminate blanket policy. All of this had real impacts on very vulnerable people, who lost touch with their families and couldn’t get their asylum documentation, while the phones languished on a shelf for many months.” The Home Office has been approached for comment.",News/UK news,"Home Office illegally seized phones of 2,000 asylum seekers, court rules",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/25/home-office-illegally-seized-asylum-seekers-phones
3/26/2022,"Joe Biden was asked twice in a press conference on Thursday if Nato would respond with military action were Russia were to use chemical weapons in Ukraine, a fear raised repeatedly over the last few weeks by the US, UK and others. “We would respond,” Biden said in his first answer. “We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.” The second answer was less clearly expressed. “It would trigger a response in kind. Whether or not – you’re asking whether Nato would cross – we’d make that decision at the time.” It was clear from the context that a “response in kind” was intended to mean it would be a considered reaction to what was deemed to have taken place. Military action was by no means certain – although Biden was careful not to rule it out either. Russia is one of 193 countries that have signed an international treaty banning the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons – and Moscow denies having or using such weapons. However, Russian agents used a deadly nerve agent, novichok, in Salisbury in 2018, killing one woman. It was used again by agents to poison opposition leader Alexei Navalny in August 2020. Investigative journalists believe Russia retains a covert chemical weapons programme, while its ally, Syria, is accused of repeatedly using a range of chemical weapons during the long running civil war there. Western leaders have become concerned that Russia’s failure to achieve a quick victory following its invasion of Ukraine means it could consider escalating the weapons it uses to avoid bloody urban warfare, which favours the defenders. Helicopters dropping chlorine gas in residential areas of Aleppo in November and December 2016 led to the end of rebel resistance in the Syrian city after four years of fighting. “These weapons are morbidly effective and can break the will of civilians to resist,” said chemical weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon. Biden’s answer was clearly conditional on what any attack would look like. De Bretton-Gordon argues there are two possible types of Russian attack – a chlorine or ammonia attack, which the Kremlin would could try to dress up as an industrial accident, and the use of chemical weapons specifically designed to kill – such as sarin, which was used in Syria in 2017, or novichok. “In the first instance, I am not sure there would be a kinetic [military] response from Nato – allies would more likely want to supply Ukraine with more and better weaponry and extra intelligence if they can. But if Russia used agents only designed for use in warfare, Nato would likely have to respond militarily as they did in Syria,” said de Bretton-Gordon, also a former commander of Nato’s chemical weapons force. The US engaged in two sets of strikes in Syria. Missile strikes took place in April 2017, followed the sarin gas attack. Air and missile attacks followed year later in April 2018, after a chlorine gas was used in Damascus, with the help of France and the UK. Each time what were described as Syrian chemical weapons sites were targeted. But any attack by Nato forces – or a subset of western countries – would be very unlikely to attack chemical sites in Russia directly for fear of starting a general war, which Nato members agree they want to avoid. The reality of Russia’s ability to strike back against the west may well make a military response impossible. Potentially, although nobody knows what Russia’s red lines are. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy made a direct appeal at Thursday’s Nato summit for more higher specification arms, fighter jets, tanks, rocket artillery and air defence systems. Western nations could step up military aid. A second option would be to tighten economic sanctions further, using the illegality of chemical weapons as as justification. Options would include sanctions against other Russian banks and a full ban by the EU and the UK on oil and gas imports, although that would be, for some countries, an economically difficult decision to take. Western leaders say they want to preserve “a bit of ambiguity” in any response, as the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said on Thursday. But the reality is that serious discussions will only take place after any chemical weapons attack.",News/World news,Could Russia use chemical weapons in Ukraine and how would west respond?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/could-russia-use-chemical-weapons-ukraine-nato-west-respond

3/26/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to choose a side when it comes to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine during a heartfelt address to EU leaders. Zelenskiy said Orbán needed “to decide who you are with”, as he thanked EU leaders for imposing sanctions on Russia but reproached them for being “a little late”. A visibly tired but emphatic Zelenskiy name-checked all 27 EU member states in his address by video link on Thursday night, noting those who supported Ukraine and those he thought could do more. But the most spine-tingling moment came when Zelenskiy confronted Hungary’s leader, whose recent condemnation of the war has not allayed doubts about his pro-Kremlin leanings, after years as Vladimir Putin’s staunchest ally in the EU. “Listen, Viktor, do you know what’s going on in Mariupol?” Zelenskiy said, drawing a line between the brutal bombardment of the strategic port city and Hungary’s past. Referring to Hungary’s “tragic history”, Zelenskiy recalled visiting a memorial on the banks of the Danube that commemorates Hungarian Jews who were shot in 1944-45 by local fascists. Scores of iron shoes are embedded in the embankment in memory of men, women and children who were forced to remove their footwear, before being shot into the freezing river. Speaking directly to Orbán, Zelenskiy said: “Please, if you can, get to your waterfront, look at those shoes. And you will see how mass killings can happen again in today’s world. And that’s what Russia is doing again today. The same shoes. In Mariupol there are the same people. Adults and children. Grandparents. And there are thousands of them. And these thousands are gone and you hesitate whether to impose sanctions or not.” Accusing Orbán of hesitancy in allowing weapons to pass through Hungary and in cutting trade with Russia, he said: “There is no time to hesitate. It’s time to decide.” The Hungarian government is not joining other EU countries in supplying arms to Ukraine, nor will it allow weapons to pass through its territory. Budapest argues such steps would endanger people in Transcarpathia, a region in western Ukraine with a large Hungarian minority. The Hungarian government has not commented publicly on Zelenskiy’s remarks. Renewing Ukraine’s appeal for EU membership, Zelenskiy listed every EU member state, evaluating their level of support. Poland, the Baltic states, Slovenia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria stood with Ukraine, he said, but others, he suggested, had some way to go: “Spain, we will find common ground with … Ireland, well almost …. We believe that Germany will also be with us at the crucial moment.” The only other leader Zelenskiy mentioned by name was the French president, Emmanuel Macron, with a hint that he did not detect Paris’s full support yet. “France, Emmanuel, I really believe that you will stand for us.” France, along with the Netherlands, has warned against enlarging the EU too quickly and does not want to rush the membership process. Despite Zelenskiy’s appeal for further sanctions, EU leaders did not make immediate promises for restrictions on Russia, but said in a late-night statement they would “move quickly with further coordinated robust sanctions on Russia and Belarus to effectively thwart Russian abilities to continue the aggression”. Zelenskiy was speaking to EU leaders after they met Joe Biden in a show of transatlantic unity. The US president stressed the importance of keeping up the momentum on sanctions, while expressing understanding of Europe’s difficulty of weaning itself off Russian fossil fuels, according to an EU official familiar with the talks. On Friday, Biden and the European Council president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced that the US would provide “at least” 15bn cubic metres (bcm) of liquefied natural gas to the EU in 2022 to help Europe curb its consumption of Russian gas. Von der Leyen said this was a “big step” and promised the EU would ensure “stable demand” for 50bcm of US sea tanker gas by 2030. In 2021 Russia sent about 155bcm to the EU, about 40% of the bloc’s gas consumption.",News/World news,"‘Decide who you are with’, Ukrainian leader tells Viktor Orbán",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/ukraine-leader-volodymyr-zelenskiy-hungary-viktor-orban
3/26/2022,"The UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, met DP World boss Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem last November and told him that he was “aware of the issues at P&O Ferries” but recognised “you will need to make commercial decisions”, according to official minutes of the meeting. The revelation raises further questions about whether Shapps could have acted to head off the mass sackings last week at the Dubai-owned ferry operator. On Monday, Shapps told the Commons that “the first I heard about it was at 8.30 in the [Wednesday] evening, not through the memo, which I did not see, but instead through communication with my private office to indicate that P&O would be making redundancies the next day”. Shapps said he expected P&O Ferries to consult on more redundancies rather than instigate mass sackings. The Department for Transport minutes show Bin Sulayem welcomed Shapps to DP World’s pavilion at the Dubai Expo on 22 November. During the face-to-face encounter, the sultan warned Shapps: “In respect of our ferry business, there’s a new low-cost competitor from Irish Ferries. This poses challenges in respect of P&O’s operations. We kept ferries operating during the height of the pandemic to support movement of people and goods.” Shapps thanked Bin Sulayem and told him: “I’m aware of the issues relating to P&O. I recognise you will need to make commercial decisions, but please do keep us informed.” Bin Sulayem added: “As we recover we can reinvest in the UK. We make a significant amount of income from the passenger side of our business (even though it only makes up c.30% of total business), because the margins are so tight on the cargo side.” Shapps replied: “I appreciate everything you’ve done to support P&O.” The minutes were published after revelations at Thursday’s extraordinary joint hearings of the Commons transport and business select committees, where P&O chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite admitted wilfully breaking employment law to summarily sack almost 800 crew without consultation. He told MPs that DP World had notified the government of planned changes to the business model. Maritime minister Robert Courts, speaking later in the hearing, said: “There was a discussion about challenges to the business but not any more than that.” The mass sackings have been met with widespread outrage although not action from the government. Earlier on Friday, Shapps called for Hebblethwaite to quit, saying: “I cannot believe that he can stay in that role having admitted to deliberately going out and using a loophole – well, break the law. “They flagged their ships through Cyprus [which meant they] avoided having to tell anybody about this, or they felt they did. And even though they know they’ve broken the law, what they’ve done is to pay people off in such a way to try and buy their silence. It’s unacceptable.” However, Labour said Shapps had the power to disqualify Hebblethwaite as a director rather than simply call on him to quit. Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said: “They should act now. A week on from 800 loyal British workers having their rights trampled on, the Government have still done absolutely nothing to hold P&O Ferries to account.” On Friday, Hebblethwaite emailed P&O Ferries staff attempting to clarify “issues” in his testimony to MPs. Although he had told the committees he would make the same business decision again, he told staff: “The first is that this type of dismissal could not happen again.” He added: “The second point is that no criminal offence has been committed… There has been a failure to comply with the obligation to consult.” A DfT spokesperson said: “DP World did not mention to the transport secretary any changes it would be making to P&O Ferries and there was no indication of the completely unacceptable changes it has subsequently made.”",News/Business,P&O Ferries: questions raised over Grant Shapps’ meeting with DP World,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/25/po-ferries-questions-raised-over-grant-shapps-meeting-with-dp-world
3/26/2022,"“Donald Trump may have caught another lucky break,” said Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday evening, “thanks to this newly elected and soon to be reviled all around the world district attorney Alvin Bragg.” Bragg, recently sworn in as the Manhattan district attorney, abruptly stopped the pursuit of an indictment against the former president for financial crimes following a years-long investigation. The shift prompted the resignation of a senior prosecutor on the investigation, Mark Pomerantz, who said in a resignation letter that he believed Trump was “guilty of numerous felony violations” and that it was “a grave failure of justice” not to pursue charges. Pomerantz went on to say that prosecutors have evidence Trump falsified financial records - “he falsified hurricane records, of course he falsified financial ones,” Kimmel responded. “He’d falsify Don Jr’s birth certificate if he thought he could get his name off of it.” “If they don’t move forward with the investigation,” he continued, “that means Trump has now been let off the hook by Congress twice, Robert Mueller once, he just won that case against Stormy Daniels – I’m starting to think the only one who can bring him to justice is the Batman.” In other Trump news, the former president severed ties with one of his most loyal political lackeys, Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, after Brooks told a campaign rally crowd to move on from the 2020 election. “Mo Brooks was a leader on the 2020 election fraud and then, all of a sudden, during this big rally in Alabama, he went ‘woke’ and decided to drop everything he stood for,” Trump said in a statement. “Mo Brooks was to Donald Trump what ingrown hairs are to armpits. They were like this,” Kimmel said, wrapping his fingers together. “Only the best people.” On the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon mocked a group photo from the Nato emergency summit in Brussels. The “family photo” featuring the heads of state before a stone wall “looks like the sales team at a Honda dealership, doesn’t it?” said Fallon. “I’m expecting them to all say together ‘We’re ready to serve you!’ “It’s a very diverse group – there are suits of every color,” Fallon quipped. “That’s either a Nato summit or a conference for men who don’t know what to do with their arms photo.” In other news, due to an ingredients shortage, General Mills has struggled to supply grocery stores with Totino’s pizza rolls and Pillsbury cookie dough. “It’s serious – as soon as he heard, Biden called Nato back for another emergency summit,” Fallon joked. “Right now General Mills is like, ‘Hey but we still have plenty of Fiber One bars!

3/26/2022,"Across English football, we’ve seen a spate of high scorelines, whether it was last year’s 9-0 victory for Manchester United over Southampton (one of the biggest win margins in Premier League history), United’s 11-10 defeat by Villarreal in the Europa League final, the nail-biting 21-goal penalty shootout between Liverpool and Chelsea in the League Cup final last month, or October’s record-setting non-league match, which saw 44 penalties. I asked Duncan Alexander, sports data expert and chief editor at The Analyst, why. Hi Duncan! So why are there more goals in football now?Do you mean penalties? Or goals generally? Both!In penalty shootouts, yes, there are more. In terms of goals generally, they increase or decrease based on changes to the game. If you go back to the mid-1920s, there was a jump because the offside rule was changed, so rather than having three defenders between you and the goal when the pass is played, it went down to two, which is what it is now. From the 1970s, goals declined, probably because of improved goalkeeping and more effective tactics. Everyone in England and Ireland has a fondness for the 1990 World Cup because both teams did really well. To the rest of the world, it’s seen as this horrible, grim, low-scoring, defensive, cynical tournament. I’m interested to hear you say that. My husband is of the mindset that true fans don’t need goals.He’s got a point. Until it went to penalties, this year’s League Cup final was 0-0, but it was a great game. When VAR came in, more penalties were given. Two seasons ago we were on course to see 300 penalties in the Premier League season, but it slowed down because even the refs thought: this is mad. So you get these spikes. So we are in a spike? I knew it!Well, no. Oh.This season, we’re at 2.77 goals per game. In the history of the Premier League, the average is 2.65. The highest we’ve seen in the Premier League was in 2018/19, which was 2.82. If you go back to the start of football, in the 1890s, then it was more than four. We are getting a few more unusual score lines. I support Wycombe in League One, who had a 5-5 draw last month. There wasn’t a 5-5 for about 25 years, and there have been about five in the past 10 years. But these are random incidents rather than a shift to more goals. Does money factor? I feel as if every time I watch Man City, there are six goals.It’s less about the money paid for players and more about coaching. Italy’s Serie A in the 1980s bought all the best players, but it didn’t turn them into goal-scoring machines. OK, and what about penalties ?Players are really good at taking penalties now. There was also a rule tweak about three years ago where keepers were no longer allowed to move off the line. So we’re seeing penalty shootouts go into double figures. Is there an argument for saying that if governance can generate more goals, then let’s ’ave ’em!There was a José Mourinho quote when Arsenal beat Spurs 5-4 in 2004. He said churlishly: “That is not a proper football score; it is an ice hockey result.” I think the reason football is the world’s most popular sport is that it’s low-scoring.

3/26/2022,"England face Bangladesh in their final group stage match of the World Cup at Wellington on Sunday – a game which they must win if they are to guarantee qualification for the semi-finals. Australia and South Africa have already qualified, but England are still fighting it out with India and West Indies for the two remaining semi-final spots. India face South Africa on Sunday at Christchurch, in what is another must-win match: should either India or England lose their final game, West Indies will qualify at their expense. There is another factor at play. Australia have finished top of the table after winning all seven of their groupstage matches, meaning that whoever finishes fourth will have to play them in the semi-finals – an encounter England will be keen to avoid after their recent disaster in the Women’s Ashes. England may, therefore, wish to go at Bangladesh hard, as if India win then the team with the better net run rate will play South Africa, not Australia, in their semi-final. On the other hand, a win against Bangladesh is by no means a foregone conclusion, especially given England’s catastrophic start to the tournament. By contrast Bangladesh have punched above their weight, claiming a historic nine-run win against Pakistan, and falling only five runs short of a victory against possible semi-finalists West Indies. On Friday it was Australia’s turn to survive a scare. Chasing just 136, Meg Lanning’s team stumbled to 70 for five, after Bangladesh’s off-spinner Salma Khatun tore through their top three, including bowling Lanning for a duck. Australia eventually got over the line with five wickets to spare but the match shows how easily England’s fixture against Bangladesh could turn into a banana-skin. England may opt to bring back Charlie Dean in place of Emma Lamb if the conditions are amenable to spin, but are otherwise likely to play an unchanged XI after Katherine Brunt’s return to form against Pakistan on Thursday. “We certainly talked about me missing games [pre-tournament],” Brunt said. “But every game has been a must-win game.

After three tumultuous months of dodging media scrutiny, he was relaxed enough to take an unscheduled extra question – and boast about being the only prime minister with the Russian first name Boris. Colleagues say the war in Ukraine has given Johnson renewed purpose: he repeatedly urged fellow leaders in Brussels to do more to aid the Ukrainians in their struggle, with one source describing him as “genuinely tortured” at not being able to go further. Certainly, the conflict has driven a very different story about Johnson; the partygate scandal is out of the headlines, for now, and the national polls have narrowed as his vocal support for Ukraine in its hour of need has dominated the news. Even many of Johnson’s fiercest Tory critics believe he is now safe for the foreseeable future. One downhearted MP last week bemoaned the “spineless” cabinet’s failure to get rid of him when the partygate scandal was at its height, sighing: “we’re stuck with him until the next election!” The MP – one of the few to have gone public with a letter of no confidence – said they were “in despair” at colleagues rowing back on their criticism but believed there was nothing the hardcore rebels would be able to do to get rid of him now unless there was an unexpected twist in the scandal. Such a twist may yet come: the Metropolitan police’s statement last week that they were beginning to interview witnesses over allegations of lockdown rule-breaking in Downing Street raised the extraordinary prospect that Johnson could be questioned under caution. The force’s statement also made clear its inquiry now involved reviewing questionnaires from more than 100 people in and around Whitehall. That officers now need to speak to some of them suggests there isn’t a consistent story – and therein lies another potential jeopardy. The former chief whip Mark Harper went public this week with his insistence that the crisis was not over for Johnson, telling ITV’s Peston that while it was not an issue for today, “I happen to think when you’ve got a really difficult international crisis, it’s at exactly those times actually that you’ve got to be clear that your leaders are straight with you, tell the truth at the dispatch box, and can be trusted – and we’re going to have to look at what happened, what’s concluded, and then make a judgment.” Even without partygate, some of Johnson’s internal critics believe the seeds of his destruction are clear to be seen: not least in his loose relationship with the truth. Fresh revelations from a second Foreign Office whistleblower this week cast renewed doubt on Johnson’s insistence that he did not order the prioritisation of an animal charity in the Afghan airlift last summer, in just one recent example. The prime minister’s relationship with the Evening Standard owner, Evgeny Lebedev, whom he ennobled despite concerns from the security services, has also come under fresh scrutiny since the Russian invasion. And Johnson’s ability to offend and outrage remains undimmed. His close aide Munira Mirza quit last month after more than a decade at his side, over his refusal to withdraw a smear against Keir Starmer. Last weekend, he was widely condemned for drawing an analogy between the Ukrainian people’s defence of their homeland against Russian invasion and the vote for Brexit, arguing that people choose “freedom every time”. The former Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko issued a powerful riposte, asking Johnson: “How many citizens of the UK died because of Brexit? Zero … We have whole cities which were completely erased. With this situation, please, no comparison.” Anand Menon, the director of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, said it was no surprise Johnson wanted to hark back to Brexit, which helped win him his 2019 majority. Menon said the coalition the Tories assembled had been united by values – the desire to “get Brexit done” – rather than economics. Uniting voters in a swath of ex-Labour seats with rural shires and affluent commuter belt towns on tax and spending policy may be a difficult task to pull off (levelling up may not play so well in Dominic Raab or Michael Gove’s Surrey seats, for example). Evoking the argument that Brexit was about “freedom” was an attempt to reunite those disparate voters around values, as well as allowing Johnson to replay his greatest political hit, he said. “That coalition from the general election was a values coalition that is split on economics,” Menon said. “Brexit won’t be the top issue at the next election; but Brexit makes that tribe feel like a tribe.” As well as Johnson’s Brexit remarks, that desire to call on values was clear in Oliver Dowden’s speech at the party’s spring conference in Blackpool, which involved nods to “net zero dogma”, the “cancel culture brigade” and the “privet hedges of a free people”. At the carefully choreographed get-together in Blackpool, at which Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed partygate as “fluff”, Dowden set out plans to launch a two-year campaign, to take the Tories to the next general election. Asked about Rees Mogg’s “fluff” comments, Dowden told LBC: “As you know, there’s the police investigation ongoing. At the same time we are seeing this unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, and the leadership that the PM’s showing, genuinely leading the free world, kind of puts those things into context.” The clear message to Johnson’s detractors was that after the chaos of recent months, he is back in business. And as he once told Labour: “plan beats no plan.” Senior Tories denied reports that Brexit has already been singled out as the top issue for the next general election campaign by Johnson and his team. “You wouldn’t run a campaign around something that was of low relevance to voters: it just remains to be seen where we are at the time,” said one party strategist. They expect “Brexit delivery” to feature strongly, but concede it appears unlikely to be near the top of the public’s agenda. And with millions of people dealing with a cost of living emergency, even avid Brexiters are sceptical their pet subject can be an election-winner come 2024. As one Vote Leave veteran put it: “If Brexit was genuinely our number one issue at the next election – that’s not going to win you the next general election. There is no polling that suggests that. How do you say that five years later you’re still fighting on the thing you said you’d fixed?” But the very fact Conservatives are debating how Johnson could fight the next campaign underlines how dramatically the mood has changed from just a few weeks ago, when many at Westminster believed he had little chance of surviving that long. Senior Tories say it has not harmed the prime minister’s hopes of survival that Rishi Sunak’s spring statement bombed so spectacularly this week. “Rishi is doing a good job of doing himself in,” said one party veteran. “There were a lot of people who thought that Sunak was the darling of the Tory masses – that is probably becoming less and less true. And the reason that matters is that leaders are more exposed if there’s an organised group against them, which requires a plausible alternative.” Nevertheless, the danger has not passed. A damning verdict from the Met – and Sue Gray, whose full report the government has promised to publish – would still carry shock value, and the slew of spring statement front pages this week underlined the fact that pressing domestic issues can still recapture the public’s attention, despite the horrors in Ukraine. Harper suggested the gravity of the international situation could then throw the focus back on to Johnson’s personal qualities. “Difficult decisions have to be taken at times like this, so you have to be absolutely certain that the person in charge is making the right decisions for the right reasons – and then being straight about it.”",News/Politics,Is Boris Johnson really out of the woods on partygate?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/25/is-boris-johnson-really-out-of-the-woods-on-partygate
3/26/2022,"What does it mean to be a modern mother? This is a question that has preoccupied many authors in recent years: three of the six shortlisted novels for the 2020 Booker prize focused on mother-child relationships, and fiction writers, especially female ones, are finding imaginative ways to express the notion of maternity. In Rachel Yoder’s 2021 novel Nightbitch, “the mother”, as she is known, lives a life of drudgery and boredom, devoid of the art that once gave her life purpose. The other “mommies” she meets appear to be in a trance, indoctrinated into an institution whose language and mores feel trivial, as conversations about leggings and essential oils jar with the mother’s inner rage and confusion. “I am now a person I never imagined I would be … I am stuck inside a prison of my own creation,” she wants to say to a woman in the supermarket who asks how she is enjoying being a stay-at-home mother. “I feel as though societal norms, gendered expectations, and the infuriating bluntness of biology have forced me to become this person.” Instead, she opens her mouth and says: “I love being a mom.” To become a mother is to transform, and in Nightbitch that transformation becomes literal when the sleep-deprived mother starts to grow fur. A lump is discovered near her tailbone, she grows extra nipples and her teeth seem to lengthen and sharpen. She is becoming a dog, and begins to roam the neighbourhood at night, searching for flesh. In so doing she discovers a “fresh power”, a new way to relate to her son – and an understanding of motherhood’s animalistic power. Nightbitch is not the only recent novel that explores the subject from a creaturely angle. In fact, the monstrous feminine seems to have returned with a vengeance. Some of these novels borrow from old stories, harking back to the metamorphoses of Greek myth – explicitly so in the case of Megan Hunter’s The Harpy. The novel asks: was Medusa truly a monster, or did the sexual violence wrought against her by Poseidon make her that way? There’s a lurking horror in such novels, a masculine fear of female rage and power. As Hannah Williams wrote on the monstrous feminine: “What if the woman who lies next to you at night, folds your laundry, cooks your meals, is merely hiding her claws and scales and razor-teeth and licking her lips with her forked tongue, counting the wrongs you committed against her – against all women – biding her time.” In The Harpy, female fury is again transformative. “There is a trail of anger flowing through my bloodline, from my great-grandmother, to my mother, to me,” its narrator, Lucy, tells us. When a husband betrays a wife, the wife agrees to stay with him only on the condition that she may hurt him three times. Lucy, the wife, has given up so much. She dwells in “parentworld – the place where nothing happens”, makes polite chitchat with the other mothers, many of whom have also sidelined their careers to a “forever part-time, lower-waged track” but under the surface she is becoming a harpy who “can sleep on the wing, her own body a refuge, her nails curled, ready to strike”. There is an uncanniness to the notion of the benign maternal archetype concealing something far more primal and even predatory. In Chouette, Claire Oshetsky’s novel about a woman who gives birth to a baby owl, the mother spends her nights hunting vermin, the body horror of pregnancy transposed on to a more sinister and arcane process of metamorphosis as the protagonist finds herself expecting a child that will horrify everyone but her and miss all her developmental milestones (Chouette is a parable about raising “non-conforming” children). Feminist horror has undergone a resurgence in recent years that has almost directly coincided with the election of Donald Trump and the rise of the #MeToo movement. Just as the short stories of Julia Armfield and Daisy Johnson use metamorphosis as a device to explore adolescent transformation under patriarchy, Yoder, Oshetsky and Hunter turn instead to explore matrescence – the identity transition and process of becoming a mother – and how it collides with societal conceptions of motherhood as an institution. All these novels take place in the “real world” but it collides violently with the brutal, primal realities of mothering. Williams posits that perhaps “we retreat to fantasy when we want escape from that which we cannot change”. I agree, but I also think that “the feminine fantastic” as I would call it (many of these literary examples meet the critic Tzvetan Todorov’s definition of “fantastic literature”) serves to bridge the gap between instinct and institution. The institution of motherhood, as Adrienne Rich argued, is created by men. For Yoder’s Nightbitch, that institution is “neutered and sanitised”, standing in stark contrast to the “brutality and power and darkness” of the experience and the animalistic love that results from it. There is a sense that this brutal reality at the heart of the “republic of Motherhood” remains something feral and primeval that is yet to be fully explored in language. Almost 50 years ago, Hélène Cixous wrote in The Laugh of the Medusa of a need for an écriture feminine that would rewrite the unspoken truths of the female body, it’s “otherness.” In all these works – as well as Camilla Grudova’s The Mouse Queen, from her collection The Doll’s Alphabet, which sees a woman devour her children – the female characters have been abandoned, literally or tacitly, by their male partners. These men live in a different world, the world of work, and in this sense the strangeness of the mother’s new, closed-off reality finds a natural home in fantasy. How strange, the newer novels attest, that so little in the outside world has really changed for women at all. But what if motherhood has been denied you? In Jackie Polzin’s Brood, a grieving woman battles to take care of her chickens in the harshness of a Minnesota winter. It’s a narrative with no supernatural elements, a quietly moving story of a woman’s determination to keep her animals alive, but in its way it is a primal and as desperate as the others. Life, death; it’s all here in its savage, bloody reality. All you have to do is look under the leggings.",Arts/Books,Primal screams: new novels lay bare motherhood’s true brutality,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/25/nature-nurture-new-novels-motherhoods-brutality
3/26/2022,"The number of coronavirus infections across the UK rose by an estimated 1m cases compared with the previous week, with figures in Scotland at a record high, data from the Office for National Statistics has revealed. According to the latest information from the ONS, based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, an estimated 9% of the population in Scotland had Covid in the week ending 20 March – about one in 11 people. The figure is the highest recorded by the survey since it began looking at the situation in Scotland in October 2020. Infection levels also increased in England and Wales, although they decreased slightly in Northern Ireland, with data revealing that about one in 16 people in England had Covid in the most recent week, compared with one in 20 the week before, a rise from about 2,653,200 to 3,485,700 people. The figure is just shy of the all-time high for England, when about 1 in 15 were estimated to have Covid in the week between Christmas and New Year’s Eve last year, at the height of the Omicron wave. Experts have suggested that the recent surge in infection levels in the UK is due to a number of factors, including the lifting of Covid restrictions to various degrees across the UK, changes in behaviour, waning immunity after the booster programme, and – crucially – the rise of the BA.2 variant, which appears to be more transmissible than the earlier form of Omicron. “The percentage of people with infections compatible with the Omicron BA.2 variant increased in England, Wales and Scotland and decreased in Northern Ireland,” the ONS report states. Previous ONS figures have suggested that Northern Ireland experienced a rise in BA.2 before other parts of the UK. The ONS figures also show that infection levels rose in all age groups in England. While the percentage of people testing positive was highest in children between two years old and school year 6, infection levels reached unprecedented levels in older adults: among those who are 70 or over, the figure hit an estimated 5.7% on 19 March. While all regions of England experienced a rise, the highest levels of infection were in the south-east, with about 7.5% of people – or one in 13 – estimated to have had Covid during the week. Sarah Crofts, the head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 Infection Survey, said: “Our latest data show infection levels have continued to increase in England, Wales and Scotland, driven by the rise of the Omicron BA.2 variant. “Northern Ireland was a few weeks ahead of the rest of the UK in this rising variant, where we now see a welcome decrease. Meanwhile, Scotland has now reached the highest level of any UK country seen in our survey. “Across England, infections have increased in all regions and age groups, notably the over-50s, who are at their highest levels since our survey began.” The figures come the week before free community testing ends for the majority of people. After 1 April, most people in England will have to pay to take a a Covid test, while advice to stay at home if someone has Covid symptoms is also set to be scrapped. While vaccinations, improved treatments and a shift in variant severity have all helped to weaken the link between infections, hospitalisations and deaths, the recent surge in the number of people with Covid has nonetheless impacted the NHS, with an uptick in hospitalisations – including an increase in those primarily being treated for Covid – increasing concerns over infections in vulnerable people and posing logistical challenges. Some hospitals have even suspended visiting in the wake of the rising infection levels.",News/World news,"Weekly Covid cases in UK increase by 1m, figures show",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/weekly-covid-cases-uk-rise-ons-data-figures
3/26/2022,"Young people across the world have begun a wave of school strikes for the climate, in the first Fridays for Future action since the Cop26 climate summit. Hundreds of protests were expected in communities on all seven continents, starting in New Zealand on Friday morning and heading west with the rising sun. In Manila, in the Philippines, protests coincided with election campaigning, with activists calling for an end to the government of Rodrigo Duterte, and better leadership on climate. In one of several actions in Bangladesh, young activists in Cox’s Bazar stood with their heads shrouded with black hoods, and tabards calling for a halt to funding of a new coal-fired power station. A tweet by Fridays for Future MAPA (most affected people and areas) said: “Reparation are not charity, it’s the obligation of the global north.” Protesters responding to the callout marched under the slogan “people not profit” and a statement issued by Fridays for Future linking climate breakdown and colonialism, and calling for climate reparations. In words redolent of the 2000s antiglobalisation movement, and reflecting a turn in climate campaigning towards social justice, the movement’s statement declared: “Climate struggle is class struggle.” “Colonisers and capitalists are at the core of every system of oppression that has caused the climate crisis, and decolonisation, using the tool of climate reparations, is the best kind of climate action,” it said. “The richest capitalist 1%,must be held responsible for their actions and wilful ignorance. Their profit is our death. Their profit is our suffering.” In Europe, many events were also linked to the invasion of Ukraine. Big events were expected in Brussels, where Ukrainian and other eastern European climate activists have been lobbying politicians for an embargo on Russian fossil fuels, and Berlin, where Ukrainian and Ugandan activists were to join the protests. Twitter posts showed large crowds in Aachen, Germany, marching behind a banner saying: “Capitalism is not a law of nature.” In Scotland, several protesters chanted outside the Scottish parliament at Holyrood, Edinburgh, holding a banner declaring: “People not profit.” In Glasgow, activists blockaded the offices of a Russia-linked shipping company, demanding an end to gas shipping that is fuelling the invasion of Ukraine. Four activists locked themselves to bikes, a fifth to a gas canister, and another three activists sat and blocked the office. They held banners demanding “Stop Shipping War” and “Make Renewables Not War”, and burned blue and yellow smoke flares, representing the colours of the Ukrainian flag. In England, response to the callout was muted. While in the past thousands of children and young people have demonstrated outside parliament, on Friday no mass actions were planned in London.",News/Environment,Fridays for Future school climate strikes resume across the world,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/25/fridays-for-future-school-climate-strikes-resume
