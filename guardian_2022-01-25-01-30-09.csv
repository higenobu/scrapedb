1/25/2022,"Newcastle could turn their attention to Tottenham’s Dele Alli if they are unable to reach an agreement with Manchester United over a loan deal for Jesse Lingard. Eddie Howe, who has strengthened his squad by signing Chris Wood and Kieran Trippier, is desperate for further additions as he tries to save his side from relegation. Newcastle want more firepower and have targeted Lingard, who has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford.  The 29-year-old forward is likely to leave on a free transfer when his contract expires at the end of the season but it remains to be seen whether he will be allowed to spend the rest of the campaign at Newcastle. Newcastle, who boosted their survival hopes by beating Leeds last Saturday, have had one loan bid turned down by United and could attempt to make the deal happen by offering a bigger loan fee for the England international. However United are being indecisive about whether to let Lingard go out on loan, keep him or make money by selling him. Lingard, who has made 14 appearances this season, is not short of suitors. Spurs and West Ham are interested, though United are reluctant to do business with their rivals for fourth place. Lingard had a productive loan at West Ham last season, but it is unlikely that he will return. The situation is unpredictable, though, and United’s indecision has forced Newcastle to make alternative plans. They are considering a move for Alli, who has fallen out of favour under Antonio Conte at Spurs. The 25-year-old was not even on the bench when Spurs lost to Chelsea on Sunday and has been told that he can leave on loan. Alli’s career has stalled in the past two years and his days at Spurs look numbered. The forward is not in Conte’s plans but his talent is not in doubt. It is understood that Howe has not made up his mind on him yet. Newcastle are also trying to sign a central defender. They have been in negotiations with Sevilla over Diego Carlos and also admire Burnley’s James Tarkowski, who is out of contract this summer. However Burnley are determined not to sell.",Sport/Football,Newcastle push again for Jesse Lingard and could turn to Dele Alli if move fails,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/24/newcastle-jesse-lingard-manchester-united-loan-dele-alli-spurs
1/25/2022,"Seven weeks before the Australian Open began, as most tennis players were figuring out how they would tackle the off-season to come, Stefanos Tsitsipas had a different predicament. After years of pain management and a bitter withdrawal from the 2021 ATP Finals, he had undergone surgery on his right elbow to alleviate his problems for good. As he lay in his hospital bed on 23 November, Tsitsipas faced a race to be ready in time for a new season. On Monday night, before a thunderous crowd filled to its 50% capacity with members of Melbourne’s Greek community, Tsitsipas, the fourth seed, recovered from two sets to one down against one of the tour’s in-form players, defeating American Taylor Fritz 4-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 to reach the quarter-finals. Tsitsipas will next face the 11th seed, Jannik Sinner, who was an efficient 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, 6-4 winner over Alex de Minaur.  “An epic match, that’s what I can say,” said Tsitsipas afterwards. “I gave everything out on the court today. I’m very proud of myself, the way I fought, the way I stayed consistent in the moments that were very close and crucial. I’m overwhelmed. Just too much. The stadium was on fire. It’s too good to be true.” Fritz, the 20th seed, has recently been in the form of his life. He does not have the athleticism of some of his peers, but he is blessed with a fast arm, a big serve and he is technically solid off both wings. He used those weapons and his confidence seamlessly, dominating his service games and generating 13 break points on the Tsitsipas serve. While Tsitsipas was not his direct, attacking best, he dug in; he fought desperately for every last point and he used every inch of big match experience he has accrued in his young career. Such was his focus, Tsitsipas lost track of the score in the second set and initially did not even realise he had won it. When the decisive moments came, Tsitsipas was ready. He snatched the decisive break by soaking up Fritz’ attack and then produced a sweet, dipping forehand passing shot at 4-4 in the fifth set. He ended the set with just four unforced errors and, under immense pressure, he moved on. Tsitsipas, followed by cameras for a Netflix documentary, said afterwards that his recovery from elbow surgery was a surprise even to his own doctor, yet he is still here. “I knew that Australia was coming soon and I would have to be playing again very soon. I missed two weeks of preseason, which was not too bad, because the doctor predicted otherwise. My recovery was faster than anyone would have thought it would have been. My recovery was very surprising to my doctor.” Earlier in the day, Daniil Medvedev, still the tournament favourite, moved on into the quarter-finals with a tough 6-2, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (4-7), 7-5 win over Maxime Cressy. Cressy, a 24-year-old American born in Paris, has frustrated many with his serve and volley style as he has risen up the rankings. On Monday, it was Medvedev’s turn to be irritated as he struggled to convert break points in the third and fourth sets. As his anger rose, Medvedev began to vent, calling the match “boring” and complaining about his opponent’s luck. He spoke in English throughout, his third language. In an interview with Eurosport, Medvedev admitted, apologetically, that he was playing some mind games, which he regretted. “During the match I got a little bit crazy, I think, with myself,” he said. “I even went a little bit, tried to talk something in the air to get into his mind a little bit so maybe he starts saying: ‘What the hell is Medvedev saying?’ And maybe, I don’t know, he’s gonna miss some shots. I’m not happy with what I said today but the most important is that I managed to keep on fighting.” Medvedev expressed regret for his comments in his press conference afterwards. “I don’t like trash talking. I sometimes can unfortunately roll into this, but I don’t like it. I think I try almost never to do it, especially against other players, and again, today was borderline. I don’t think I actually said anything bad about Maxime, but, yeah, borderline where I’m not really happy about it,” he said. Medvedev will face ninth seed Félix Auger-Aliassime next, who recovered from a set down against Marin Cilic to reach his third consecutive major quarter-final with a 2-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) win.",Sport/Sport,Stefanos Tsitsipas roars back to beat Taylor Fritz in Australian Open epic,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/24/stefanos-tsitsipas-roars-back-to-beat-taylor-fritz-in-australian-open-epic
1/25/2022,"At Moorgate tube station in London’s financial district, more commuters braved the return to office on the first Monday since government guidance to work from home was lifted. “It does feel busier today, it’s good – London’s waking up,” said the woman staffing the barriers of the station.  The great awakening is happening slowly, however. Customers at the Lazy Coffee stall in Abchurch Yard, a stone’s throw from the Bank of England, suggest it may take a while. Matthew Staite, the proprietor, has kept the stall going except for the very depths of lockdown: “It’s been a pretty good barometer.” He hasn’t seen a significant rise in numbers but expects next week to be busier. “I’ve heard companies are starting to work out their gameplan. But no one’s said that people are coming back full-time.” He greeted a familiar customer, returning to a nearby investment bank. The young man, who didn’t want to be named, said he had not made the choice to return. “It’s coming from the top,” he said with a grin. The bank will do an 80/20 office/home split in theory: “But not every week”. Transport for London recorded about 6% more tube journeys in the morning peak than a week ago. A similar picture was played out in Manchester, where 9% more tap-ins were recorded on Metrolink trams before 9am this Monday than last, according to Transport for Greater Manchester. Some have happily returned, after Boris Johnson revoked the work from home guidance for England last week. One of the few suited passengers on an early Northern line train to Moorgate, James Warnaby, 32, was heading for a first day back in the office this year at his financial services recruitment firm. “I’m very much pro going back.” But his job-hunting clients have made him think few will return to offices full-time: “We have people saying I want two days a week at home now, or I’m not moving.” On London Bridge another recruitment professional, Alex Edwards, 37, who has commuted in from Brighton throughout, said his train remained “nice and empty – I always get a table for my laptop”. But he said while some clients are “social animals, who want to be in the office”, most of the older ones are devotees of home working, leaving the City barren. “It’s not the same. I don’t think it ever will be.” Walking towards Bank was Diane Nagy, 54, head of bids at the IT firm NTT, on her second day back in the office. “I’m delighted,” she said. “I’ve put a note out to say I was going in. I think everyone’s excited – all my colleagues have been really positive.” Many she has only met so far on Zoom: “I joined this company during the pandemic and don’t know how tall or short they are.” She had walked to work from Wapping in east London, and admitted she may have been more hesitant if commuting. But she missed busy office life: “I miss queueing.” There were no queues at Nicholson & Griffin hairdressers at Leadenhall market. “It’s not changed today,” said Jana Lanka, 27, without a client in the first hour of opening. Pre-Covid, the early slot would be sought-after, and staff had hoped the changed guidance would mean immediate custom: “But on Friday we only had two clients walk through the door. And looking at appointments for this week, it’s not busy at all.” Network Rail, which owns and operates most of the UK’s big train stations, said Monday morning’s footfall was down 0.3% from a week ago, with Mondays now the quietest day of the week for commuting. In Manchester, Holly Paterson was on her way into her city centre solicitor’s office “for the first time in ages”. Her firm has allowed staff to choose their own pattern of working and Paterson was less concerned about the Omicron variant: “I’ve been there, I’ve done it, we’ve had it, so I feel fine.” Dan Draper, one of two solicitors going into his office throughout the whole pandemic, said: “It’s clearly a lot busier than it was 12 months ago on the trams, people are becoming more confident.” But, he added: “Nowhere like pre-pandemic levels … There’s loads of businesses really suffering still.” One passenger making the journey by Metrolink into the city centre was Aisha Iqbal, who works in customer service and has been asked to return to the office every day. She said she feels safe commuting in from Oldham on the tram: “The windows are open and the majority of people are wearing masks.” Iqbal said she welcomed the return to the office: “I prefer it, it just gives me a break. At home, it’s waking up 10 minutes before, logging on and then after work if there’s more to do, I literally sit there until 7pm.” Trainee accountant Phoebe Scott cycled in to central Manchester, after returning by choice in early January. “I’ve got quite a small room, a really, really small desk and a flatmate as well,” she said. “So it’s hard to concentrate.” Back in London, Soho was busier with builders in hi-vis vests than the media and marketing industry workers that thronged its bars and restaurants before the pandemic. Most cafes and flexible working spaces had only a smattering of clients. Francesco Pucino, the owner of Bar Bruno cafe on Wardour Street, said business was still at least 40% down. He said he had not seen a significant return of office workers, and was also missing out on business from early morning clubbers, taxi drivers and tourists. “I hope it will pick up. We need it. We have been struggling. Each person that comes back spends £5 or £10 here and there, and that makes the economy go round. Like this it is impossible to live.” Ben Ravenscroft, in London for a social media marketing photo shoot for the first time since mid-December, said: “It’s good to be back, seeing people and socialising again. With an agency it is really collaborative and it is a lot easier to have a conversation than write an email, a lot quicker.” Lily Hewitt, a receptionist at a suite of media offices, said: “The trains were packed on the way in, and a lot more people have come in today. It’s much better. Before Christmas no one came in for five days. It was really spooky, I had the whole building on my own. It’s been so quiet it’s weird but I hope we will get there.”",News/Cities,‘I don’t think it will ever be the same’: commuters slow to return in England,https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2022/jan/24/i-dont-think-it-will-ever-be-the-same-commuters-slow-to-return-in-england
1/25/2022,"Global stock markets have fallen sharply as fears of military conflict in Ukraine sent shares sliding. European markets tumbled by 4% to their lowest levels since October, after Nato said it was reinforcing its eastern borders with land, sea and air forces as a Russian invasion of Ukraine appeared increasingly likely.  In the City of London, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index was down 2.4% to a one-month low in afternoon trading on Monday, with miners, energy firms, financial companies, housebuilders and travel stocks weaker. In New York, the S&P 500 index of US stocks shed 2.3% in early trading. That took the S&P 500 more than 10% off its record high set at the start of January and into correction territory. Investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as the US dollar, and also the Swiss franc, which hit a six-year high against the euro. The sell-off in risk assets hit cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin falling to a six-month low of about $33,000. Investors were also concerned that the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, would raise interest rates several times this year, starting in March, after US inflation hit a 40-year high of 7% last month. The Fed, which will meet this week, could also start to run down its balance sheet this year, removing some of the stimulus introduced since the Covid pandemic began. The prospect of tighter monetary policy has driven technology stocks lower and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.75% on Monday, adding to recent losses. The UK’s FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies tumbled by 4%, hitting its lowest level since March 2021.

1/25/2022,"Clubbers in London’s Tiger Tiger were mistakenly given caustic soda instead of salt when knocking back tequila slammers, sending four people to hospital after suffering burns. Police attended the nightclub near Piccadilly Circus in central London last month after receiving reports that people had chemical-related injuries, believed to be caused by a staff error. Authorities then closed Tiger Tiger as a precaution.  A Metropolitan police spokesperson said: “Police were called to Tiger Tiger at approximately 10.50pm on Tuesday 7 December following reports of four people who had suffered burns after coming into contact with a substance, believed to be a strong alkali, at a venue in Haymarket. “Four females received treatment at the scene before being taken to hospital. None of their conditions are life-threatening. A fifth person, a male, also came into contact with the substance but has declined hospital treatment. “The incident is not being treated as suspicious and there have been no arrests. The Health and Safety Executive has been informed.” Caustic soda, or sodium hydroxide, is an alkali often used in soap and paper production and in powerful cleaning substances. The Haymarket venue, known for its Ibiza-inspired party rooms, is operated by British hospitality group Novus Leisure, which owns 41 bars, restaurants and nightclubs in cities across the country. A shot of tequila is made into a slammer by licking salt first and then sucking a lime or lemon after. A source told the Sun: “A group of four women and a man necked the tequilas and used salt and lemon to soften the taste, then began to retch. One girl keeled over. Despite music blaring, everyone knew something was wrong. There was panic. People thought it was some kind of terrorist incident. “It took a long time to establish what happened.” According to the Sun, one of the victims is still requiring hospital treatment more than a month after the incident. Tiger Tiger and Novus were contacted for comment. A Met police spokesperson said the force is “not aware” of any similar incidents in London, but said such “accidents” are not always referred to the police and may instead go to the Health and Safety Executive or emergency services. The Health and Safety Executive did not respond to a request for comment. Novus was listed for sale by its private equity owner, Hayfin Capital Management, in 2018.

1/25/2022,"Children’s television makers have said that distinctly British kids’ programmes could vanish from screens and be replaced with imported shows, after ministers quietly closed a £44m fund designed to support the sector. The Young Audiences Content Fund had been intended to help British broadcasters compete with the globalised children’s output available on YouTube and cartoons on US streaming services such as Netflix.  Anna Home, chair of the Children’s Media Foundation campaign group, called on the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, to reverse the decision: “Now we face a definite decrease in the number and range of programmes being made for young people in the UK … and in fact it’s worse as the BBC is facing government-imposed budget cuts of its own over the next few years too.” The pilot scheme had operated for the last three years with a remit to help revive British children’s programming on channels such as ITV and Channel 5. The UK’s commercial broadcasters have massively cut spending on original children’s content after the 2006 ban on advertising junk food to children, essentially handing control of the British children’s TV sector to the BBC. The decision to close the fund comes shortly after Dorries announced plans to freeze the BBC licence fee, forcing the broadcaster to review its own spending plans. Home argued that children should be able to watch distinctly British programmes that reflect their own lives and culture, rather than international content that could have been produced anywhere in the world: “A generation of young people denied their own stories will grow up to be a generation with little loyalty for the institutions and values of the society in which they live.” The fund – along with a much smaller pot for radio programming – helped cover up to 50% of the costs of making a children’s series, with money coming from an unspent levy allocated in the 2010 BBC licence fee settlement. Continuing the fund would have required the government to find another source of funding. The Children’s Media Foundation has suggested the government could reinstate £16m of cash it took away from the fund during the Covid pandemic – or charge US streaming companies such as Netflix and Disney+ a levy to fund British content. Konnie Huq previously spoke out in support of the fund and said society should care more about the media that children are watching. The former Blue Peter presenter said: “We make sure kids are eating their broccoli and pay for all this good stuff to be put into their bodies and make them really healthy. But then it’s easy to shove them in front of a tablet as free babysitting.” The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has been contacted for comment.",Arts/Television & radio,British kids’ TV shows under threat after ministers end funding ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/24/british-kids-tv-shows-under-threat-ministers-end-funding
1/25/2022,"How should culture respond to the climate crisis? Can it provide a wake-up call that isn’t so brutally loud and depressing that we don’t just smash the alarm clock and go back to sleep?  Exhibit A in such debates right now is Don’t Look Up, Adam McKay’s comedy/disaster film about two astronomers (Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence) trying to warn that an Everest-sized comet is hurtling toward Earth. The star-studded allegory of distraction and denialism has been panned by critics but praised by climatologists. Don’t Look Up zooms out on a stellar scale; FloodZone: Photographs by Anastasia Samoylova zooms in to hyperlocal effects of sea level rise, tidal flooding and shoreline erosion in Florida. But the exhibition – at the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk, Virginia – takes aim at the same human flaw of cognitive dissonance. Samoylova is well placed to explore it, having been born in the Soviet Union in the 1980s and observed the gap between its government’s utopian imagery and the grind of everyday life. When she moved to Miami Beach in 2016, she again found a disconnect between idealised visions of tropical paradise and the reality of flooded construction sites, rusted infrastructure and endangered wildlife. After riding out Hurricane Irma in a mandatory evacuation zone, Samoylova wandered the deserted city and photographed gleaming high-rise condominiums towering over flooded streets. Her show juxtaposes giant adverts selling an optimistic image of the future with scenes of decay and disrepair – testament to a rapacious property market determined to keep partying on the eve of apocalypse. “She talks quite a bit about looking at Soviet propaganda images of the good life and how that counteracted her personal experience of things and that, I think, is what she first found in Miami, too,” says Seth Feman, the Chrysler Museum’s deputy director for art and interpretation and curator of photography. “You have the wraparound privacy screens that they put over building sites and those will have images of what is to come: beautiful minimalist condos with happy people lounging about in them. It is propaganda at its core.” But before climate anxiety turns to despair, visitors to the museum will find a companion exhibition: Waters Rising, which includes scientific models, video simulations, photos and artwork examining sea-level rise in coastal communities across Norfolk and other parts of the Hampton Roads region – and some potential solutions. The show, a collaboration with the Institute for Coastal Adaptation and Resilience at nearby Old Dominion University, offers a series of action steps including practical advice on green electronics, light bulbs and washing clothes and how commuters can reduce their carbon footprint. Feman says: “We really wanted to put this in people’s hands to give them a sense that they’ve seen something pretty horrific but they can leave the museum thinking about what they can do.” He adds: “It goes beyond that, too, because I wanted people to try to come to terms with how to express what’s going on. As somebody who lives facing water every day, I often feel like I don’t have the terms to even describe what we’re facing because it’s a slow catastrophe. “It’s not like a volcano erupts or an earthquake happens. It’s this slow wearing away and rising of water. One of the installations in the exhibition specifically focuses on language and how we might grow new terms in order to express the strange feelings that we have when confronted by this. “That really goes hand-in-hand with Anastasia’s work because she is visually expressing this strange emotion of fear and anxiety but also there are moments of real beauty. How do you hold this all together at the same time?” The threat to Norfolk from sea level rise is comparable to that facing Miami and New Orleans. The Chrysler Museum overlooks an inlet from the Elizabeth River, a tidal estuary at the southern end of Chesapeake Bay. During storms, the museum itself can be cut off, effectively becoming an island. “Every day I have to look at the weather and make a decision on how I’m going to walk into the office, how I’m going to walk my dog,” says Feman, 42, who lives four blocks away. “There are roads that are impassable depending on what’s happening. “If there’s a flood or if there’s been heavy rains or sometimes if there’s been heavy winds, it can cause water to pile up in certain areas. So sometimes I have to go right instead of left because I can see from where I’m coming that the road will be impassable if I go down that way. It’s anecdotal, it’s not scientific, but it’s to my mind much worse than it was nine years ago when I got here.” The museum hosts a two-day symposium examining themes and questions raised by the exhibitions on 12 and 13 February. Feman welcomes the ways in which artists are trying to think and feel about the climate crisis differently. “There’s an important role to play for document here but I’m also interested in images that might help us get our minds and our actions moving. Part of the motivation here is that we wanted people to take time and look closely at a problem and it’s really hard to show people images of disaster and to get them motivated. “Sometimes fear works, but oftentimes people will just turn the page or look away and finding artists who can really invite people in to think seriously and effectively about about the world around them is immensely valuable.” The curator notes that Samoylova’s exhibition includes two photos that are not from Florida but Tangier Island, a Virginia fishing town of about 400 people with a rich seafaring culture that appears doomed to sink under water. “She presents two very beautiful images from Tangier and it gets to the point that, since we know it’s about when not if, how might we live differently now? Do we just go wild – the sky is falling so let’s do whatever we want? – or do we meaningfully connect with people? “Do we find another way to move forward in the time in the places that we’ve got? Those images depict things but they are, at their core, about absence. They’re about loss and there’s no escaping it when you look at them.” FloodZone: Photographs by Anastasia Samoylova and Waters Rising: A View From Our Backyard are on display at the Chrysler Museum of Arts in Norfolk until 29 May",Arts/Art and design,‘It’s a slow catastrophe’: artists try to tackle the dangers of rising sea levels,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/24/climate-crisis-floodzone-anastasia-samoylova-exhibition

1/25/2022,"Here is a continuation of Gabriel Tejedor’s fascination with the debris of the former Soviet Union; this latest documentary sets its gaze on the industrial city of Magnitogorsk, situated 2,000km from Moscow. Here, time stands eerily still. Once celebrated as the “socialist city of steel”, Magnitogorsk typifies Stalin’s vision of transforming the largely agrarian nation into an industrialised superpower. Sprawled over the landscape is the colossal structure of Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works (MMK), the “kombinat”, or conglomerate, whose formidable influence embodies state authority, reflecting numerous key chapters in the country’s history. More than a Soviet relic, MMK is still the main employer in Magnitogorsk, and one of the biggest steel manufacturers in the world. Its unnerving omnipresence is evoked here in its conspicuous glossy billboards, and also in the lengthy tracking shots that swirl leisurely around the metal arches and the ever-burning furnaces of the factory – images at once grandiose and terrifying.  Making for a stark juxtaposition is Tejedor’s moving attention to the mundanity of everyday life. Next to MMK, and its strange, over-the-top PR ceremonies held in the style of old-school Soviet propaganda, the people of Magnitogorsk appear small and insignificant, but their simple hopes pierce through the city’s iron-gray listlessness. They dream of leaving, of escaping the hazardous pollution, of sending their children to better schools, or simply of doing anything but steelwork. These snapshots of everyday life capture a growing generation gap – the older residents are grateful for Vladimir Putin’s government while the younger ones do not shy away from criticism. Kombinat could have dug deeper into the historical context of MMK’s creation, but nevertheless it conveys a searing sympathy for those whose future is shrouded in darkness.  Kombinat is available on 28 January on True Story.",Arts/Film,"Kombinat review – dark, eerie doc on Russia’s ‘socialist city of steel’",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/24/kombinat-review-dark-eerie-doc-on-russias-socialist-city-of-steel
1/25/2022,"A call from a stranger may elicit myriad responses – panic, confusion, maybe even excitement – but it turns out that hippos have a rather more corporeal reaction: they spray dung. Researchers studying hippopotamuses in Mozambique have revealed that the creatures not only react to the vocalisations of other hippos, but that the calls act as an identity signal. In other words, they allow hippos to tell the difference between a familiar individual and a stranger.  “Hippos are quite talkative. They have a repertoire of different calls: wheeze honks, grunts, bellows, squeals,” said Prof Nicolas Mathevon, of the University of Saint-Etienne in France, a co-author of the study. “However, the function of these calls has not been studied experimentally. Our study is the first to test experimentally the function of a hippo call.” Writing in the journal Current Biology, Mathevon and colleagues report how they studied the loud “wheeze honk” calls of hippos – a sound not unlike a growling laugh. The team recorded calls from individual hippos within groups – or pods – living in the same or different lakes in the Maputo special reserve. Five pods were then played back calls from an individual in their own group, a neighbouring group at the same lake, and a distant group of hippos that were strangers to them, while two pods were played calls from their own group and a distant group. The team found that hippos responded to the calls by calling back, approaching the sound or by spraying dung. The latter, however, was more common when the call was from a stranger than from a hippo of the same or neighbouring group. “When we played back familiar calls … the reaction was not aggressive. Basically, they just called back,” Mathevon told the Guardian. The team add that the hippos’ responses were stronger for calls from individuals that were less familiar. “Our experiments suggest that in hippos, the arrival of a stranger individual is perceived as more threatening than that of a neighbour,” the team write. While Mathevon said it was not a surprise that hippos use vocalisations to communicate – noting they are an excellent way to send information – he said the results show that hippo groups are territorial. The team add that their experiments show wheeze honks can travel more than 1km (0.6 miles), suggesting hippos would be familiar with the calls of others living on the same lake. “The most interesting thing to come out of this study is that hippos may have a fine-grained knowledge of the voices of all the individuals around them, and that this knowledge can help them navigate in their social network,” said Mathevon. The team said the findings could have implications for conservation, particularly when it comes to relocating individuals. “It may be possible to get the local hippos used to the voice of the new ones before they arrive and vice versa,” said Mathevon. “Of course, we are not saying that this measure will be sufficient to suppress all aggression, since other sensory signals are certainly also involved, but it may help.”",News/Environment,Hippo talk: study sheds light on purpose of call and response,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/24/hippo-talk-study-purpose-call-and-response

Partygate Still the biggest threat to Johnson’s premiership, the government and the Conservative party have been rocked by a series of claims about staff parties held in Downing Street and elsewhere in Whitehall while lockdown restrictions were in place. From the “bring your own booze” party of 20 May 2020 in the Downing Street gardens to the Christmas party in December 2020 that the PM’s former press secretary was filmed joking about, allegations of Covid rule-flouting have mounted up. Sue Gray, the senior civil servant tasked with looking into the claims, is expected to publish her findings this week. She has reportedly interviewed Downing Street police officers about the allegations and was due to interview Dominic Cummings, the PM’s former adviser, on Monday. Islamophobia Johnson has been forced into ordering a formal inquiry into allegations by the Tory MP Nusrat Ghani that she was sacked as a minister after being told her “Muslimness” was “making colleagues uncomfortable”. Ghani, an MP since 2015 who lost her job as a junior transport minister during a reshuffle in early 2020, said Tory whips told her that her “Muslim woman minister status was making colleagues feel uncomfortable”. The Conservative chief whip, Mark Spencer, identified himself as the person accused of making the remarks. Whips’ tactics The Conservative party whips – officials whose task is to ensure party discipline – have been accused of using blackmail against MPs seeking to oust Johnson. The senior Conservative MP William Wragg, who chairs a government scrutiny committee, claimed there was attempted blackmail against some of his colleagues involving public money. Two MPs – the Tory defector Christian Wakeford and Andrew Bridgen, another Johnson critic – have spoken publicly about the tactics they claim were deployed against them. Wakeford backed up the claims by Wragg that threats involving public money were made by the whips. Wragg and others have encouraged MPs to report such behaviour to the police. The culture at No 10 Underpinning all of the above are questions about the culture over which Johnson has presided at the very top of government, including an allegedly rampant drinking culture among staff. Reports of a member of the team filling up a suitcase with booze from a supermarket for one of the parties were reportedly not a one-off. There have been numerous reports that the PM is considering firing several of his aides, including but not limited to Dan Rosenfield, the longtime civil servant who became his chief of staff only a year ago; Martin Reynolds, the PM’s principal private secretary who sent the above-mentioned “bring your own booze” invite; and Jack Doyle, the No 10 director of communications. There are reports that frustrated MPs are taking advantage of the prime minister’s weak position to press for concessions on key policy and legislative changes. These include: Drop planned rise in national insurance contributions (NICs) Conservative MPs have reportedly met the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to apply pressure on the Treasury to ditch the planned 1.25% rise in NICs in April, which they argue will hit families at a time when they are also facing a sharp rise in the cost of living. Cut VAT on energy bills The PM is reportedly considering cutting VAT on energy bills. Labour and energy firms have called for the move – and so have some Tory MPs, who are piling pressure on the PM to act. Push back mandatory NHS jabs The Sunday Telegraph reported that an option being considered by Downing Street is to delay by six months the requirement for all NHS staff to have a Covid vaccine, to help quell a revolt among Tory MPs. Other policies facing scrutiny from Johnson’s MPs include pressure to drop what the Tory peer Lord Marland has called “fluffy” environmental policies, for which Marland provides the animal welfare sentience bill as an example, while the prominent backbencher Steve Baker has said net zero emissions targets could be “bigger than Brexit” for potential to cause unrest. Post-Brexit politics continue to play a role, though, with reports that the Tory MP Bernard Jenkin has laid out Brexiter demands in return for support for Johnson. Elsewhere, a ban on gay conversion practices could be in backbench sights, with as many as 30 Tory MPs warning against rushing through a new law “without debate”.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s many challenges – and how Tory MPs aim to capitalise,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/24/boris-johnsons-many-challenges-and-how-tory-mps-aim-to-capitalise
1/25/2022,"Sarah Palin has tested positive for the coronavirus – on the first morning of her defamation trial against the New York Times. Jed Rakoff, the US federal judge presiding over the case in Manhattan, announced the test result on Monday.  “She is of course unvaccinated,” the judge said, referring to the former Alaska governor, 2008 Republican vice-presidential pick and conservative political star. Two years into a pandemic that has killed more than 865,000 people in America, resistance to vaccinations and other public health measures is common on the political right. Palin has urged followers not to get vaccinated. In December, she told an audience at a conservative event in Arizona: “It’ll be over my dead body that I’ll have to get a shot. I will not do that. I won’t do it, and they better not touch my kids either.” She tested positive last March – and advised followers to wear masks. Her positive test before the New York trial was an at-home test, Judge Rakoff said, adding that she would be retested before it was determined whether jury selection should be delayed or the trial adjourned until February. Palin, 57, says a 2017 Times editorial falsely linked her to a mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona. The editorial was published after a shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, in which Steve Scalise, a member of House Republican leadership, was wounded. The Times said the Tucson shooting, in which six people were killed and a Democratic congresswoman, Gabby Giffords, was severely injured, came after Palin’s political action committee circulated a map putting 20 Democrats including Giffords under “stylised crosshairs”, and that “the link to political incitement was clear”. Palin objected to language that James Bennet, the Times’s former editorial page editor, added to a draft prepared by a colleague. She contends that the added material fitted Bennet’s “preconceived narrative”, and that as an “experienced editor” he knew and understood the meaning of his words. She is seeking unspecified damages, but according to court papers has estimated $421,000 in damage to her reputation. The Times corrected the editorial to remove any connection between political rhetoric and the Arizona shooting. Bennet has said he did not intend to blame Palin. A Times spokesperson told CNN: “We published an editorial about an important topic that contained an inaccuracy. We set the record straight with a correction. We are deeply committed to fairness and accuracy in our journalism, and when we fall short, we correct our errors publicly, as we did in this case.” Many contend that Palin deserves criticism for employing dangerous rhetoric – if not in direct relation to the Tucson shooting. On Sunday, the gun control campaigner Shannon Watts said: “In 2010, Sarah Palin created a target list with crosshairs of a gun sight over Congress members’ districts. While that campaign may not have been directly related to the Tucson shooting, she helped create today’s culture of political threats and violence.” But on the right, many hope Palin’s case will lead to a revision of the high standard for proving libel of US public figures – an aim cherished by Donald Trump among others. Freedom of the press is enshrined in the first amendment to the US constitution, ratified in 1791. The supreme court adopted the “actual malice” standard, which makes it difficult for public figures to win libel lawsuits, in 1964, in the landmark New York Times v Sullivan decision. Two justices on the current, conservative-dominated supreme court, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have suggested revisiting that standard and Palin has signaled that she will challenge the Sullivan precedent on appeal if she loses at trial. Most observers expect her to lose, particularly because the paper so swiftly acknowledged its error. But the Times faces an embarrassing few days in court. Benjamin Zipursky, a Fordham University law professor, told Reuters Bennet’s “immediate sort of emergency mode or panic mode” upon learning what happened strongly suggested he had been unaware of any mistake. “Negligence or carelessness – even gross negligence – is clearly not good enough for Palin to win,” Zipursky said. But Bill Grueskin, a former senior editor at the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News who now teaches at Columbia University, told NPR: “It’s going to be great courtroom theatre. “You’re going to have Sarah Palin up there on the stand. You’re going to have some of the top people at the Times – at least of the opinion section. I don’t see how that can fail to be interesting.” Grueskin also said that when it comes to rightwing attacks on press freedom, the case “could add more fuel for that fire”. Roy Gutterman, a professor of law and communications at Syracuse University, told Reuters: “This is a potentially dangerous area. If we give public officials a green light to litigate on editorials they disagree with, where’s the end?”",News/US news,Sarah Palin tests positive for Covid as New York Times defamation trial starts,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/sarah-palin-new-york-times-trial
1/25/2022,"At the start of 2020, I was working on a piece about Question Time, and how it had transformed over time from being an ambling, rather niche discussion show into politics’ answer to Jeremy Kyle, with an audience of incredibly angry people trash-talking imaginary immigrants living in mansions with their 14 imaginary children. Oh, the spiral! Some lefty would invent the term “gammons”, and then the Twitterati would have an even more vicious spin-off row about whether that word was itself more racist than the original racism. It was all quite hard to unpick. So, with what I now know to be a terrifying naivety, I remember thinking, when the pandemic hit: “Thank God; we’ll surely be right as dodgers in a month or two, but for those few weeks nobody will be wanting dispatches from this peculiar front of the culture war.”  Well, Covid was obviously more horrifying and lasted rather longer than I had supposed, but this week the worlds of Question Time and corona collided. The host, Fiona Bruce, appealed on social media for unvaccinated people to appear in the audience. On the one hand, a laudable – nay, splendid – effort to seek out the voices of the unheard, the people Hillary Clinton might describe as “deplorables”, the citizens saying out loud what so many think, in order to break the liberal-elite stranglehold on common sense. On the other hand, dude, have you really thought this through? What if, being unvaccinated, they all give each other Covid and some become seriously ill? What if the vaxxed audience members, after a risk assessment, decline to sit next to them, and your balanced discussion forum is torpedoed, replaced by middle-aged Hunger Games? What if someone dies? People say that, when you’re making a complex ethical decision, you should try to imagine explaining yourself to a magistrate: “Well, your honour, a lot of people have had enough of science …” This is very much the preoccupation of our age, how to knit a fraying public discourse back together, how to communicate with people whose views don’t match your own. Established principles range from the obvious (try not to be a dick) to the well-worn (don’t hector anyone with your facts and statistics). You’re not supposed to myth-bust, as that tends to reinforce the myth in your opponent’s imagination. Instead, establish from the start that you see the good in them. In a debate with an anti-vaxxer, that might go something like: “I can see that you just want to keep your family safe …” I wouldn’t be able to say a thing like that with a straight face, but that’s just a curse some of us have – highly legible features, like Buster Keaton. Increasingly, though, theorists are moving away from the idea that a perfect argument exists, where you listen in the correct, active way, and use exactly the right language and tone, to metaphorically unblock the Suez Canal, whereupon commerce can once again open up between one side and the other. Instead, if you find yourself in a culture war, figure out whether your opponent is persuadable or implacable. “Persuadable” is wondering what the civil liberties implications are of mandatory vaccination; “implacable” is thinking vaccines are really a plot by a cabal of billionaires to wipe out sheeple by making them infertile. “Implacable” is QAnon, it’s climate change or Holocaust denial, it’s white replacement theory, it’s any idea that relies on a secret, concerted, long-range conspiracy that, if you know anything about humans (their ability to keep a secret, for one), you know to be functionally impossible. There’s no point trying to persuade the implacable, but you do have one job, and it’s the very devil of a job: to stop them persuading anyone else. I think maybe “Keep them off Question Time” is good start but I am – and I hope always to remain – persuadable.
