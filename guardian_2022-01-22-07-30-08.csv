1/22/2022,"Harlequins simply do not know when they are beaten and Alex Dombrandt‚Äôs hat-trick try, in the 85th minute, sealed another dramatic comeback for the scrapbook. Castres had battled their way into a four-point lead in the final minute of normal time and had one hand on a place in the last 16 but the Quins captain came up with a close-range try to break the French side‚Äôs hearts. In doing so Dombrandt laid down a considerable marker for the England No 8 jersey. The make-up of Eddie Jones‚Äôs squad appears to have created an opening at No 8 and, though he has his rivals, few would begrudge Dombrandt a Six Nations start against Scotland. Certainly, he signs off his club duties in considerable style, tipping this chaotic if highly entertaining clash in Harlequins‚Äô favour.  After Toulouse‚Äôs match was cancelled earlier in the day ‚Äì much to the fury of the defending champions ‚Äì this fixture took on added significance. Suddenly Castres‚Äô chances of reaching the knockout stages had been boosted and a bonus-point victory, or a win by eight points or more, would push Toulouse closer towards the brink of elimination. Harlequins, however, knew a bonus-point win by the same margin would be enough to top the pool. Harlequins were already assured of a place in the last 16, hence the decision to leave Marcus Smith and Joe Marchant on the bench and Danny Care out of the squad altogether. But in Joe Marler, Dombrandt, Andre Esterhuizen and Louis Lynagh there was still plenty of star power in the home side‚Äôs ranks. Castres had not won an away match in this tournament since December 2012 but within the first five minutes they had built an 8-0 lead. Ben Botica, up against his former club, kicked a straightforward penalty before the captain and hooker, Ga√´tan Barlot, struck with the opening try from a clever lineout move. Harlequins were reeling when Antoine Zeghdar darted through a gap for another Castres try but the Premiership champions fought their way back into a 19-16 lead. First Dombrandt showed his class with a finish in a tight corner on the left and, while Botica added another penalty, Huw Jones pounced on a loose ball under the posts before Viliami Taulani barged over from close range. A yellow card for Marler for kicking through a ruck played a significant part in Castres taking the lead into the interval, however. Another clever lineout move freed Filipo Nakosi down the left and he released Rory Kockott to cruise over. Botica converted before a Tommy Allan penalty trimmed the deficit to a point. Despite Castres having the numerical advantage, Harlequins clinched the bonus-point try soon after the restart, Dombrandt comfortably finishing off an overlap for his 10th try of the season. Castres would not go away, however, and secured their own bonus point when Nakosi gathered Botica‚Äôs crossfield kick before barging over. Botica pulled the conversion, ensuring Harlequins still led by a point. He really ought to have added another try, too, but after dancing through the Harlequins defence Botica inexplicably dropped the ball just before the line. No matter for Castres, the impressive Adrea Cocagi powered over soon afterwards to nose the visitors ahead once more. Harlequins summoned Smith from the bench and though he brought his usual vim and vigour, it looked as if he was powerless to stop Castres clinging on for victory. Dombrandt had other ideas, though, and after wave upon wave of Harlequins pressure he squeezed the ball over the line ‚Äì the try awarded by the referee Mike Adamson after much deliberation with the TMO.",Sport/Sport,Alex Dombrandt‚Äôs late heroics earn Harlequins thrilling win over Castres,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/21/alex-dombrandts-late-heroics-earn-harlequins-thrilling-win-over-castres

1/22/2022,"All things considered, the Matildas‚Äô 18-0 destruction of Indonesia provided a somewhat anticlimactic stage for Sam Kerr to etch herself into the record books as the greatest goalscorer in Australian history. When it comes to points of historical significance, there is generally a romantic desire for a scene you could slap an orchestral score on ‚Äì circumstances that help contribute to the mythology surrounding the achievement.  Entering the opening game of the AFC Women‚Äôs Asian Cup requiring a single goal to pull alongside Tim Cahill‚Äôs 50 atop the national team‚Äôs all-time charts, Kerr needed just 11 minutes to match and subsequently surpass the Socceroos great‚Äôs tally. With no fans in the stands due to Covid restrictions, and no real resistance in front of her, Australian football‚Äôs golden girl went on to net a further three before her 68th-minute substitution, taking her four clear of Cahill on 54 goals. Her teammates proved equally merciless: Emily van Egmond hit a hat-trick; Hayley Raso, Ellie Carpenter and Kyah Simon struck twice; and Caitlin Foord, Mary Fowler, Tameka Yallop and Aivi Luik all added individual strikes. It was all a bit too easy. Yet Kerr‚Äôs record ‚Äì and what she has accomplished in a career that has many more chapters still to write - is truly remarkable. She reached the milestone in four fewer games than Cahill and, unlike the former Everton attacker, spent much of her formative years juggling careers in multiple leagues in different countries with an intense international schedule just to commit full-time to the sport. Kerr‚Äôs talent eventually saw her become the first marquee player in A-League Women history. During that time, the Matildas secured a number of improvements in working conditions and it is without question that she and her teammates effectively dragged the Australian system with them. Now she is the greatest goalscorer in her country‚Äôs history and one of its most famous and celebrated athletes. Just days out from the start of the Cup, Fifa recognised the striker as the second best player in the game or, to put it another way, declared that of the 3.9 billion women on the planet, just one ‚Äì Spain‚Äôs Alexia Putellas ‚Äì is better at playing football than the 28-year-old from East Fremantle. It is quite possible that had Kerr been afforded the same level of professionalism and opportunities for development as her male counterparts, she would have surpassed Cahill a long time ago. It took just over seven years ‚Äì 2,627 days ‚Äì for her to reach double-figures after scoring her first international goal at the 2010 Asian Cup. In the four and a half years since, she has scored 42. A portion of this is undoubtedly down to her status as her team‚Äôs talisman ‚Äì a challenge for coach Tony Gustavsson to balance with the broader Matildas‚Äô collective ‚Äì but the improvements in working conditions for female footballers on- and off-field during this period cannot be ignored. It is both remarkable and a warning to Australian football not to rest on its laurels that had there been options for her to keep playing with girls as a child ‚Äî as exists now ‚Äî she likely would have followed her family to AFL football. There's another boxer in town! ü•äüòâ Congrats @samkerr1 on becoming the all-time leading üá¶üá∫Australian goalscorer - both men and women! Another amazing achievement! pic.twitter.com/PlO07gqqAb Kerr‚Äôs exploits aside, there is little to be extrapolated from the Matildas‚Äô opening outing in India. It was a procession for the Australians, a 90-minute training drill that provided less challenge than the intra-squad scrimmages in their pre-tournament training camp. A number of Indonesian players sought photos with Kerr after the game ‚Äì clear recognition of her stature in the game and symbolic of how she and her teammates effectively operate on a different plane to some of their continental rivals. Nonetheless, in deploying a high-powered starting XI against a nation 91 places below Australia in the Fifa rankings, Gustavsson was clearly trying to start with a bang. After the match, he said the fixture represented an opportunity to ‚Äúset the tone‚Äù for what is to come and hinted that a ruthless approach, even against such minnows, will be a feature of his side‚Äôs ‚Äúperformance mode‚Äù. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in a similar situation before as a coach going into a tournament when you have a low-ranked team in the opening game and how important it is to treat that team with respect but also show respect to our values and our standards,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe other thing we need to remember is an international team and don‚Äôt get many minutes together. Pre-camp has been very short leading into this one. We have some players coming back from different situations that actually need minutes to get up and running ‚ÄúSo there are different reasons but the number one reason is that we need that cohesion between the players and get off on a good start to send some messages to ourselves and to the other ones how we are treating this tournament.‚Äù",Sport/Football,Record-breaker Sam Kerr out on her own after remarkable Matildas scoreline | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/22/record-breaker-sam-kerr-moves-out-on-her-own-after-remarkable-matildas-scoreline
1/22/2022,"In 1974, on the first anniversary of the Roe v Wade supreme court decision, abortion opponents gathered on the National Mall in Washington to ‚Äúmarch for life‚Äù. They vowed to return each year until the ruling, which established the right to abortion, was no longer the law of the land.  On Friday, anti-abortion activists braved sub-zero temperatures and the coronavirus pandemic to assemble in Washington again, more hopeful than ever that this would be their last march to a court where the fate of Roe will soon be decided. ‚ÄúWe are hoping and praying that this year, 2022, will bring a historic change for life,‚Äù Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, told a crowd tens of thousands strong and waving signs that read ‚ÄúI am the post-Roe generation‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe future is anti-abortion‚Äù. Praising followers for standing against what she called the ‚Äúsingle-most critical rights abuse of our time‚Äù, Mancini said they sent a clear message to the supreme court: ‚ÄúRoe is not settled law.‚Äù Chris Smith, a Republican congressman from New Jersey, described the mood as one of ‚Äúfresh hope and heightened expectations‚Äù. The court‚Äôs conservative supermajority appears open to reversing Roe, thereby overturning nearly 50 years of precedent since the 1973 decision. Dan Lipinski of Illinois, who was one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress before a primary defeat in 2020, said he was optimistic activists would meet next year in a ‚Äúnew era‚Äù, one without Roe. At the White House, Joe Biden‚Äôs press secretary, Jen Psaki, noted the anniversary of Roe v Wade and said ‚Äúreproductive healthcare has been under extreme and relentless assault ever since, especially in recent months‚Äù. She said the Biden administration was committed to working with Congress to pass a bill that protects the right to provide and access abortion care free from forced waiting periods, biased counseling and other restrictions. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre deeply committed to making sure everyone has access to care and we will defend it with every tool we have,‚Äù Psaki said. For decades, polling has found that a majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or some circumstances. In a statement, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, Mini Timmaraju, said: ‚ÄúThe anti-choice movement knows they are on the wrong side of public sentiment, which is why this year‚Äôs March for Life theme relies on deliberate disinformation to maintain its power. ‚ÄúThey falsely claim to be supporters of ‚Äòequality‚Äô all while working ardently to block abortion access and end the legal right to abortion. Make no mistake ‚Äì this movement‚Äôs end goals would only criminalize and endanger people based on pregnancy outcomes, furthering inequality. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ A small but vocal minority is determined to undermine the will of the majority of people in this country who support reproductive freedom.‚Äù Conservative states have recently made inroads. Last month, the supreme court heard oral arguments in a case involving a Mississippi law which bans abortion after 15 weeks and makes no exceptions for rape or incest. A ruling is expected by the end of June, months before the midterm elections. If the court overturns Roe, more than half of US states are ‚Äúcertain or likely‚Äù to ban abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights group that tracks legislation regarding women‚Äôs reproductive health. Conservative states are laying the groundwork for new restrictions as fights over issues like telemedicine and abortion pills gain momentum. Last year, according to Guttmacher, states enacted more than 100 new abortion restrictions, a record. Mancini said: ‚ÄúIf Roe falls, the battle lines will change. But make no mistake, the fight for life will need to continue in the states.‚Äù Hours before marchers arrived on the National Mall, the supreme court declined to accelerate a legal challenge to a Texas law that has effectively banned abortions in the second-largest state. Among the marchers, there were few references to that victory or to the Texas law, which is deeply unpopular, including among Republicans. ‚ÄúI just pray every year that this is the last year we‚Äôre here,‚Äù said Janice LePage, who works for the youth ministry in the Archdiocese of St Louis. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm praying that the following year will be a march of celebration.‚Äù",News/World news,Tens of thousands ‚Äòmarch for life‚Äô in Washington as fate of Roe v Wade looms,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/march-for-life-washington
1/22/2022,"Have the lights gone out on Watford and Claudio Ranieri? Josh Sargent, the American scoring two fine goals, the first a piece of volleyed improvisation, the second a fine header, before Juraj Kucka‚Äôs late own goal, pulled Norwich out of the bottom three, and for the first time this season, Watford fell into the drop zone. A match that embraced farce, in terms of its low-quality football, and a lengthy floodlight failure that came in between Sargent‚Äôs second-half goals, offered plenty of evidence why both teams are where they are. At a club with owners not shy of making multiple managerial changes, Ranieri‚Äôs future can only be in severe question.  With Newcastle struggling to spend their new owners‚Äô cash and Burnley beleaguered, a relegation equation of three from four appears set in stone. Neither of these teams had the finance or ability to take a sunshine Saudi break like Newcastle, and yet might still escape, this the definition of a six-pointer. Norwich could climb out of the Premier League relegation zone for the first time in 53 matches, last week‚Äôs defeat of Everton the first victory any of the bottom four had celebrated in 20. The first half‚Äôs sequence of panicked, mediocre play suggested just why these two were part of that quartet. With a pre-match tribute paid to Graham Taylor, Watford‚Äôs greatest ever manager, on the fifth anniversary of his death, there was a gala atmosphere. It took time for either team to rise to the occasion. Milot Rashica buzzed with intent but Norwich‚Äôs static front pairing of Teemu Pukki and Adam Idah gave him little to work with. It was Rashica, with a blocked free-kick, and a 12th-minute sighter, firing the shots during early-stage dominance by the visitors that did not last. Dean Smith, the Norwich manager, having stopped the rot of six league defeats in succession, had opted for the same team as against Everton, minus injured keeper Tim Krul, replaced by Angus Gunn. Todd Cantwell, linked with a January transfer, was absent from the squad despite being on the pitch with his colleagues pre-match. He was soon joined in the stand by Jacob S√∏rensen, replaced in midfield by Kenny McLean after an early knock. It took until the 16th minute for Watford to string two passes together, a move that ended with Emmanuel Dennis‚Äôs misjudgment of a cross. Characteristically, Ranieri had shuffled his pack after last week‚Äôs draw with Newcastle ended a run of seven defeats, making four changes, though he was also forced to swap in his goalkeeper with Ben Foster, missing with Covid, replaced by Daniel Bachmann. Craig Cathcart, another of Watford‚Äôs veteran class, was also missing. In his absence, new signing Samir climbed highest to a Tom Cleverley corner but his header on the half hour was saved easily by Gunn as Watford began to ratchet up the pressure. Norwich stayed back in numbers, now themselves incapable of completing a sequence of passes. Dennis, having been booked for a foul on Pierre Lees-Melou, was perhaps lucky to escape a second booking for simulation when hitting the deck with the same player in his vicinity. The first half closed with Jo√£o Pedro and Moussa Sissoko missing decent chances for Watford. Sissoko‚Äôs muscle, shouldering off Max Aarons, created an early second-half chance that Jo√£o Pedro wafted over the bar as the ineptitude continued at both ends, with Watford soon paying for theirs. Sargent‚Äôs first goal, as well taken as it was, saw Sissoko lose possession before Samir was caught and robbed by Pukki, and the ball rattled off the crossbar, behind the line and out before it was awarded. Ranieri soon made his first change, the ineffective Cleverley coming off for Cucho Hern√°ndez. That came just a few moments before the floodlight failure saw Mike Dean, the referee, halt proceedings in the 61st minute. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Norwich City, we play in the dark,‚Äù mocked the away fans though it might be said both teams had played much of the game as if blindfolded. After players informed Dean that the lights, which flickered on and then off to ironic cheers, were not sufficient to play under, there was a touchline pow-wow with both managers that ended with the game restarting after ten minutes and still in the half-light. Within two minutes of the restart, Norwich and Sargent had their second, Rashica escaping down the left, and his cross headed in by a player clearly now flushed with confidence. The home fans, staring down the barrel of Ranieri‚Äôs tenth league defeat in 13 matches, began to show their disquiet and Dennis was shown a second yellow card for a high challenge on Max Aarons. Amid gloom in both senses, Watford did try and push back into the game, with Ben Gibson forced to make a goal-line clearance, Joao Pedro having another dig from distance and Kucka having one chalked off for offside. Fully fifteen minutes had added on, but Kucka‚Äôs error, in misjudging Idah‚Äôs byline cross to knock the ball past Bachmann, hastened the end for Watford, and perhaps for Ranieri.",Sport/Football,Norwich‚Äôs Josh Sargent doubles up on a dark night for Ranieri and Watford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/21/watford-norwich-premier-league-match-report
1/22/2022,"Civil servants have been ordered to return to the office, with government departments told to rapidly get back to ‚Äúfull occupancy‚Äù after the lifting of plan B Covid-19 restrictions in England. But the announcement on Friday night sets up a clash between the government and unions, who have warned against a ‚Äúheadlong rush‚Äù back to workplaces with coronavirus cases still high. Across the UK, 95,787 positive tests were reported on Friday.  No date was provided for the return but Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, said it was important to maximise the use of office space from next week. ‚ÄúNow we are learning to live with Covid and have lifted plan B measures, we need to move away from a reliance on video meetings and get back to the benefits of face-to-face, collaborative working,‚Äù Barclay said. He is expected to raise the issue at cabinet next week and urged ministers to make sure their offices were working at full capacity as soon as possible, the Cabinet Office said in a statement. Barclay‚Äôs call for government departments to enable a return to full capacity was echoed by Alex Chisholm, the Cabinet Office‚Äôs permanent secretary and chief operating officer of the civil service, who has written to leaders across Whitehall asking them to support a significant and swift return of staff to the workplace. The government move, which is also designed to boost footfall in city centres, comes as businesses edge slowly back to the office. The London underground network recorded 8% more journeys on Thursday compared with a week earlier. Companies providing flexible office space said they were already experiencing a rise in demand as businesses and their staff returned to offices in greater numbers and adopted hybrid working patterns. The number of visitors to UK city centres outside London was up nearly 2% on Thursday compared with the same day a week before and almost 4% higher in the capital. Before the Cabinet Office announcement, the Public and Commercial Services union said it was demanding that departments consult unions and health and safety representatives on any plans for a return to workplaces. The PCS, which was among civil service unions that met the Cabinet Office on Thursday to discuss what the changes in government policy mean for members working for the civil service in England, said its position remained that it was safer for staff to work from home where they could, given the continuing threat from coronavirus. There is also resistance from the FDA, which represents senior civil servants and believes the world of work has changed for good. Dave Penman, the FDA‚Äôs general secretary, said: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement has more to do with moving attention away from the prime minister‚Äôs troubles than it has to do with how the civil service operates. ‚ÄúAll the evidence shows that across the economy, hybrid working is being embraced, delivering efficiencies for employers and flexibility for employees. Despite this, ministers are clinging to an ideology of presenteeism that demonstrates they are out of touch with how the world of work has changed since the pandemic began.‚Äù The Cabinet Office said measures had been put in place in government buildings to reassure staff and allow the transition back to office working, including increased ventilation and improved cleaning routines. It added that there was no government requirement or recommendation for employers to limit capacity in the workplace.",News/World news,Civil servants ordered back to office after Covid restrictions lifted in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/civil-servants-ordered-back-to-the-office-plan-b-covid-england
