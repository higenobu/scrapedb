3/27/2022,"Elon Musk discussed how ""great"" Russian engines are, following Russia's decision to stop US sales. Boeing and Lockheed Martin's joint ULA venture uses the Russian-made RD-180 engine. Musk suggested SpaceX wouldn't be impacted as it designs its own rocket engines. Elon Musk recently addressed the quality of Russian engines, amid Russia's decision to halt sales of rocket engines to the US. In an interview with Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, which took place at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California, Musk said the Russian-made RD-180 engine is ""a great engine."" He also acknowledged US aerospace companies, including Boeing and Lockheed Martin's use of Russian engines. ULA, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, relies on the RD-180 engine to power its Atlas V rocket, per The Verge. The plan is for the engine of ULA's new Vulcan rocket to be produced by Blue Origin, although delays have caused frustration. Musk's comments come as Russia stopped supplying rocket engines to the US in retaliation to sweeping sanctions over the country's invasion of Ukraine. ""In a situation like this, we can't supply the United States with our world's best rocket engines. Let them fly on something else, their broomsticks, I don't know what,"" Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the Russian space agency said previously. ""Is it dangerous for the United States of America?"" Döpfner asked Musk. In response, Musk said: ""Boeing and Lockheed have strongly relied on the Russian RD-180 Engine. Which I should say, to be fair, is a great engine."" He added: ""They are hoping to move away from that in the future with engines from Blue Origin. There is also the Antares which uses the RD-180, I believe. They will not be able to fly as a result."" Antares is a two-stage vehicle rocket manufactured by Northrop Grumman that provides low-earth orbit capability for payloads weighing up to 8,000 kg. It is primarily used for NASA's commercial resupply missions as part of the company's contract with the space agency. Musk's remarks echo a concern by record-breaking astronaut Peggy Whitson in a recent interview with Insider about international cooperation within the space industry. Whitson discussed the use of Russian engines by the US, saying it depends on Russian rocket engines more than she thinks it should. ""We do rely on Russian engines a bit more than I think we should, more than is ideal,"" Whitson said. ""I'd like to see us stimulating more rocket engine development in the US. I think that'd be good for us."" In regards to whether SpaceX faced risk or opportunity from halted sales of Russian engines, Musk said: ""At SpaceX, we design and manufacture our own rocket engines. So we did not really own any Russian components at all.""

3/27/2022,"DOHA (Reuters) - Turkey and other nations must still talk to Russia to help end the war in Ukraine, Turkey's presidential spokesman said on Sunday, adding that Kyiv needed more support to defend itself. NATO member Turkey has good relations with both Russia and Ukraine and has sought to mediate in the month-long conflict. ""If everybody burns bridges with Russia then who is going to talk to them at the end of the day,"" Ibrahim Kalin told the Doha international forum. ""Ukrainians need to be supported by every means possible so they can defend themselves ... but the Russian case must be heard, one way or the other,"" so that its grievances could be understood if not justified, Kalin added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged the West to give his country tanks, planes and missiles to fend off Russian forces. The West has responded to Russia's invasion by slapping sweeping economic sanctions on Moscow. Ankara says Russia's invasion is unacceptable but opposes the Western sanctions on principle and has not joined them. Turkey's economy, already strained by a December currency crisis, relies heavily on Russian energy, trade and tourism, and since the war began on Feb. 24 thousands of Russians have arrived in Turkey, seeing it as a safe haven from the sanctions. Ahmet Burak Daglioglu, head of Turkey's investment office, told the forum separately that some Russian companies were relocating operations to Turkey. Asked on a panel about Turkey doing business with any people which could be of benefit to President Vladimir Putin, he said: ""We are not targeting, we are not chasing, we are not pursuing any investment or capital that has a question mark on it."" Two superyachts linked to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich have docked in Turkish resorts. Western governments have targeted Abramovich and several other Russian oligarchs with sanctions as they seek to isolate Putin and his allies over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
