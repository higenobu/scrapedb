12/24/2021,"The number of NHS staff off sick because of Covid is rising sharply, new figures show, prompting fresh fears about how hospitals will be able to respond to any Omicron-driven surge in patients needing care. One health service leader said the NHS was now facing “a double emergency” of growing numbers of people hospitalised with Covid alongside increasing sickness absence on the frontline.  The number of staff days lost to Covid across the NHS in England hit 124,855 last week, a 38% jump on the 90,277 seen the week before, according to the latest “winter sitreps” data published by NHS England. The total number of staff absences for any medical reason – such as a cold, flu or mental health problem – also increased, though less steeply, from 416,995 to 457,135, a rise of 10%. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “These figures show how Omicron is having a tangible real-time impact on a service that was already operating beyond full stretch. This is a big worry for trust leaders.” “Absences due to Covid-19 are up nearly 40% and with community infections surging ahead, that figure may well get worse before it gets better,” he added. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, declared that “the NHS is on a war footing”. The surge in staff sickness absence is “worrying, high and rising”, he added. Covid staff sickness has rocketed 122% in a week at hospital trusts in London, which has had more Omicron cases than anywhere else in England. In the capital, 3,874 NHS staff were off for that reason on Sunday 19 December – more than double the 1,540 seen a week earlier. Across England as a whole, the number of health workers off because of Covid rose 54% in a week, from 12,240 to 18,820. In London, 515 staff were off for that reason at Guy’s and St Thomas’s trust, more than double the 193 a week earlier. The trust plans to scale back non-essential services and redeploy staff to help in A&E. At King’s College hospital foundation trust, numbers jumped from 193 to 505. The British Medical Association has estimated that anywhere between 32,000 and 130,000 NHS staff across England could be off sick with Covid by Christmas Day. “The latest data from the frontline of the NHS show that the spread of Omicron is causing a double emergency for NHS capacity, as both hospitalisations climb and as rapidly rising numbers of Covid-positive staff have to self-isolate,” said Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation. Other NHS England figures showed that London hospitals are now treating about 1,200 people who have Covid. The figures came as separate data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that about one in 45 people in private households in England had Covid-19 in the week to 16 December, up from one in 60 the previous week. One in 45 is the equivalent of about 1.2 million people and is the highest number since the ONS began estimating infection levels for England in May 2020. In London, about one in 30 people were likely to test positive in the week – the highest proportion for any region – while Yorkshire and the Humber had the lowest proportion, at about one in 65.",News/World news,NHS staff absences due to Covid soar by 38% in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/nhs-staff-sick-days-absence-england-covid
12/24/2021,"For a tennis player of such high achievement, Darlene Hard, who has died aged 85, was never really given her due. In an era that started with the domination of Louise Brough and Doris Hart and continued through such outstanding champions as Althea Gibson, Margaret Smith Court and Maria Bueno, Hard’s remarkable record of winning 21 grand slam titles – three in singles, 13 in doubles and five in mixed doubles – tended to get lost amid the blazing headlines that her rivals attracted. A happy, fun-loving personality off court, Hard was a tenacious force on it. In the days when top male players automatically played doubles and mixed, she had her pick of partners – a sure sign of the respect with which she was held. “Yes, I think she just came and asked me if I wanted to play with her at Wimbledon,” Rod Laver said. “I had seen her play and saw how well she served and volleyed which we all did in those days, so I thought I’d give it a go although I never really rated myself as a doubles player.”  The partnership clicked and they won back-to-back Wimbledon titles in 1959 and 1960 and added the French title at Roland Garros in 1961. “I served first but after that I sort of let her get on with it,” said Laver. “She volleyed so well that I knew we had good protection at the net.” Roy Emerson, another great Australian champion of the era who won numerous doubles titles but mostly evaded mixed (“because I never liked aiming at the girl”) offered an insight into what makes a successful mixed doubles team. “The woman player has to be brave enough and good enough to handle everything the men throw at her,” Emerson said. “It was clear that Darlene was tough enough to do that and, of course, in women’s doubles she was a dominant force.” Billie Jean King, who was tutored on occasion by Hard while growing up in southern California, called her the best doubles player of her generation and her record at the US championships alone would back that assertion. Hard appeared in seven consecutive doubles finals at Forest Hills between 1957 and 1963 and won five of them. Before that she had claimed her first grand slam title with Beverly Fleitz at Roland Garros in 1955 before winning again in Paris two years later with Britain’s Shirley Bloomer at her side. Hard’s success on the singles court reached its peak in the early 1960s when she defeated Yola Ramírez of Mexico in the 1960 Roland Garros final, added the US title with a thrilling 6-4, 10-12, 6-4 victory over Bueno that September and defended her title on the Forest Hills grass in 1961 by beating Britain’s Ann Haydon. But by then her career had become inextricably linked with that of Gibson, the first black player of either gender to win a grand slam title. In 1957, Gibson justified her controversial inclusion in the Wimbledon draw by beating Hard to win the women’s singles title. Gibson, who ploughed a lonely furrow in a discriminatory world, had found it difficult to find doubles partners in a lily-white game and, the previous year at Wimbledon, it had taken Angela Buxton, a British Jew who knew all about discrimination, to ask her to become her partner. They won the title and in 1957, Hard, filling Buxton’s shoes, helped Gibson defend her doubles crown. That year Gibson would win the first of her two Wimbledon singles titles, beating Hard in straight sets in the final. Either by design or just because the gesture fitted her generous personality, the blonde Californian planted a big kiss on Gibson’s cheek at the Centre Court presentation ceremony. It would pass without comment now but in the 1950s, the kiss made quite a statement. Hard turned professional in 1967 as the era of Open Tennis loomed and spent much time coaching near her home in Montebello, California, where she was born. Both her parents enjoyed sport, and her mother, Ruth, played tennis and taught her on the local courts. Darlene attended nearby Pomona College with ideas of studying medicine but, after her success on the tennis tour, she taught tennis at local clubs on retirement and opened two tennis shops. In 1981 she was offered a job at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. She worked on the production and design side of the USC’s student newspaper, the Daily Trojan, and stayed for 45 years. Except for Roy Emerson’s daughter, Heidi, who wrote for the college paper, few knew of her tennis exploits. Hard’s brief marriage, to Richard Waggoner, ended in divorce. She is survived by her sister, Claire.

12/24/2021,"On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog, went the New Yorker cartoon. Nearly 30 years later, it says so in your profile. My Instagram feed is full of dogs, or people posting as their dogs from their own accounts. Some I know well, like my sister’s sweet but vacant pug Margot.  Others I have found by searching hashtags for my favourite breeds. Now I see almost as many dogs as I do friends. It makes my Instagram a relatively peaceful place – and through the pandemic, it’s been practically restorative. Pictures of cute dogs invite only joy, not self-comparison or consumerism. It is very hard to form a parasocial relationship with someone else’s pet – or so I thought, before I found @leothepeke. With his sandy centre-parted hair and long dark ears, Leo looks like a fancy rabbit, or an Ewok. He posts about his daily life in Pennsylvania, his favourite snacks and spots to sit in and, occasionally, his views on politics. Leo hates baths – but as a Democrat, he hated Trump more. With around 2,300 followers, Leo is not a big name among dogfluencers – he describes himself as: “Just a seven-year-old pekingese, trying to make sense of the world.” But ever since I came across his profile in 2016, Leo has been my most consistent source of joy online. Whenever I felt overwhelmed by my inbox, or stressed by Twitter, I would scroll pictures of Leo to remember that the internet wasn’t all bad. By 2021, I was basically codependent. Just the sight of his dark eyes, gazing out from underneath his hair, makes my blood pressure drop and my heart swell. Over five years I’ve kept up with Leo through challenging home haircuts, celebrity deaths (he posted touching tributes to Anthony Bourdain and Ruth Bader Ginsburg), a Trump presidency and now a pandemic. I’ve seen him struggle, like everyone else on my Instagram. Last August, in an uncharacteristically long, emotional post, Leo acknowledged his “botched hair”: “Our household decided that grooming me is a luxury we shouldn’t spend on right now. No surprise – Mom’s afraid to work in schools this year … Is this our America, or am I in a very bad dream? The dereliction of duty in this administration is omnipresent.” I responded with a supportive message. After all, Leo had brought me solace for years. His photo is even my profile picture on Instagram, meaning everybody knows me as a dog on the internet. But after his outburst, I wondered: what did I really know about Leo? It is fair to say that Leo, or our interlocutor, Sandra, was surprised to hear from me. After a hesitant back-and-forth, she set up an email address especially for Leo – and we began our correspondence. “From the get-go, Leo was different,” Sandra told me. Leo’s grandfather Malachy had won best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show (held in New York) in 2012. He had been destined to be a show dog, too, but his testicles never descended, disqualifying him. Leo was adopted as a puppy by Sandra’s daughter, while her son started his Instagram. At first, “It was fun to match Leo’s face with the right words,” said Sandra. But then her son moved away and Sandra took over. Now she worries Leo’s posts are mundane. Sandra, a Democrat like Leo, tries to keep the politics to a minimum. But when she makes references to music or movies or art: “Those posts are not as well received as a cute photo of him.” Leo is “one of the most polite dogs I’ve ever known”, Sandra wrote. He awaits his meals patiently, sits on Sandra’s lap after dinner and barks when someone rings the doorbell. But, she added: “He has a pretty boring life.” He sleeps almost all day, never plays with his toys and only goes outside to do his business. Leo only likes to do two things: go in the car and chew on a beach towel. What motivates Sandra to keep up with his Instagram – “What touches my heart the most” – are the comments. One follower told her Leo reminded her of her childhood peke; another said he had provided comfort through a health crisis. “While I feel stale about his Instagram, helping a few people to have joy gives me a reason to keep posting,” Sandra said. 2021 has been a tough year for her family, too, with three deaths (including their shih-tzu Chloe, Leo’s companion) and a health scare. “I just want to move on to 2022,” Sandra wrote to me. “Next year I want to visit my grandchildren more often … I want to go to the beach and walk with the sand between my toes. I’d love to see Leo at the beach – can’t imagine him with sandy hair. And Leo would get what he loves most: being with his family, on the longest car ride of his life. Take care, Elle,” she signed off. I thought of Leo by the sea with sand in his hair, and of what PG Wodehouse said: “All one needs in life is two good friends, books and a pekingese.” He may be small, and a bit strange, but Leo the Peke really does add something to mine.",Lifestyle/Life and style,The dog who got me through 2021: Leo the Peke made my blood pressure drop and my heart swell,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/23/the-dog-who-got-me-through-2021-leo-the-peke-made-my-blood-pressure-drop-and-my-heart-swell
12/24/2021,"Netflix’s Selling Sunset is clearly doing well, given that it’s expanding its universe with a series of spin-offs. And the follow-up that has piqued my interest in particular? Selling Tampa, which follows the lives of the all-female, all black agents of Florida-based Allure Realty. As with Selling Sunset, there is plenty of cattiness and consumerism off the bat. Cast-mates preen and casually discuss “lucky Chanel handbags” on all-expenses-paid trips to Miami. It’s set against a backdrop of impractically large, undeniably impressive mansions. But while Selling Sunset focuses on a luxury real estate agency whose glamorous, all-female agents are employed by the two brothers who rule the roost – giving it a Playboy mansion feel at times – it’s female boss Sharelle Rosado at the helm of Allure. She is often a shoulder to cry on (even if some of her own clapbacks are enough to cause tears themselves). Compared with the established company run by the Oppenheim brothers in Selling Sunset, Allure Realty is essentially a startup, so the stakes feel even higher.  Like its Los Angeles-based predecessor, Selling Tampa also has a certain edge that realty-reality shows have over their contemporaries. The women more often bicker over business than boys, while also touching on themes such as divorce, familial trauma and how unplanned pregnancies can reshape a working woman’s career aspirations. Many of them are navigating their high-powered roles while juggling family life. But what it has been praised most for is its diversity. The ethnic makeup of the cast means these often sidelined conversations are even more powerful. We don’t hear enough from women in these spaces, let alone black women, and we rarely see the inner workings of black-owned businesses. In fact, Allure Realty is an all-black, all-female agency because Rosado had previously worked at companies where she was the only woman of colour and in 2019, decided to become a part of the change she hoped to see. With their casual brokering of multimillion-dollar deals, the cast is one of many US reality show ensembles that lead the way in depictions of the African American middle class. Reality TV programmes in the US have pioneered aspirational black representation, with shows like The Real Housewives franchise or Married to Medicine, which follows female doctors and the wives of doctors in Atlanta. That isn’t to say the genre hasn’t exacerbated stereotypes with their black fronted programming; fist fights and relationship woes remain central in many shows. But there are enough black casts to ensure more than one story is being told. Selling Tampa isn’t alone in focusing on affluent, successful black women. But it takes it even further in the right direction, by focusing on women whose inclusion is not by virtue of their adjacency to successful men. The commission is earned entirely by these women, with scenes more often than not passing the Bechdel test. It operates in the sweet spot between positive representation and the mess required to keep a reality show from becoming a documentary – something we haven’t yet seen in the UK. While Channel 4’s Highlife must be applauded for showcasing a different black reality, it lacked the drama needed to hold attention. ITV’s Peckham’s Finest currently lacks either. Portrayals of black excellence via reality TV aren’t perfect, but I’m glad they exist. The aim of the genre is rarely to bathe subjects in glory – programmes such as Jersey Shore, The Hills and in the UK, TOWIE and Made in Chelsea, make caricatures of their cast. But there is so little black representation that more of it can only ever be a good thing. When Cardi B name-checked her dentist Dr Catrise Austin in her 2017 hit single Bodak Yellow (and trebled the dentist’s business in the process), I was amazed to see she was a fabulous, bouffant haired black woman. My best friend, a fervent fan of shows like Married to Medicine – and the successful black people they portray – didn’t even blink.",Arts/Television & radio,Hooray for Selling Tampa! Why British reality TV urgently needs diversity lessons from the US,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/23/hooray-for-selling-tampa-why-british-reality-tv-urgently-needs-diversity-lessons-from-the-us
12/24/2021,"Comedians are not scared of anything. We’re already doing the most frightening thing of all – and once you’ve disobeyed your Asian mother, anything is possible. I’ve withstood appalling reviews, complaints from customers, dying on stage and my parents refusing to speak to me for doing jokes about them. When I performed a comedy show about Islamic State called The Kardashians Made Me Do It, the tabloids accused me of recruiting young people to the terrorist group. I’ve been called mad, bad and dangerous. Someone once threw a trifle in my face. None of this deterred me from getting up on stage and doing the same material night after night. As a comedian it is my right to offend you, and it is your right to be offended. Trust me, nothing can shut a comedian up; try getting a word in edgeways on a panel show.  The idea that cancel culture is “on the cusp of wiping out comedy”, as Maureen Lipman told the BBC this week, is self-righteous hysteria. The same YouGov poll that brought this apparently terminal threat back to the front pages also revealed that two-thirds of British people don’t know what “cancel culture” is, including 38% who have literally never heard of it. The notion that professional comedians are scared of offending for fear of their careers ending is as outrageous as having a Christmas party in the middle of a lockdown. I heard some comedians talking backstage at a gig recently about Dave Chappelle. They were saying, “He’s been cancelled.” I thought, “Cancelled? Is he a train? The 12.50 at Aintree? A credit card?” How can a person be cancelled? My peers told me Chappelle had done some offensive jokes about transgender people in his latest TV special, and he’d consequently had his new documentary pulled from some film festivals. I bought a ticket to see him at the Hammersmith Apollo. It quickly sold out. Surely if 5,000 people turn up to see you, you’re not really cancelled. Chappelle is famous for doing uneasy material. Race, drugs, sex and defending Michael Jackson. It’s groundbreaking and challenging, it’s difficult to do and sometimes difficult to watch. When that’s the nature of your comedy, it’s going to be divisive, and there’s going to be a tsunami of people on Twitter who are upset. Chappelle knows this, but it hasn’t stopped him. Everyone’s voice has the right to be heard – and his is being heard. It’s also true that over generations, people’s sense of humour changes. While a white man making jokes about his Pakistani neighbour may have been considered funny in 1975, they are not found funny today because the world has evolved. This has made a lot of people angry: mainly old white men crawling over our screens like reptiles, whining, “You can’t say anything these days.” There is a difference between being cancelled and being unemployed. Chappelle may have been “cancelled” by a few film festivals, but he is definitely not unemployed. If you’re a comedian and you are unemployed, maybe it’s because your material is as dated as you are, and it’s more convenient to blame all the petition-signing woke vegans for the fact you can’t get on Blankety Blank any more. This is all fine. I respect and revere Lenny Bruce, but I don’t laugh today at material he did in the 1950s. If you’re a comedian, you are outspoken. That’s the job. No one wants to be a secret, quiet, anonymous comedian. This furore over “cancel culture killing comedy” is entirely a media invention. In real life people have real problems: my friend Maureen, who works in a corner shop, isn’t getting “cancelled” for the jokes she tells her friends. And the biggest threat to professional comedy in the UK right now is venues closing down, tours being postponed, and my show going out of date quicker than the spinach in my fridge. People who want to say racist, sexist, homophobic or transphobic things also want a licence to say them – but then they get upset when people respond, “That’s racist, sexist, homophobic or transphobic.” That’s right. If you say bigoted things, that makes you a bigot. That’s how it goes. Just like breaking into a bank and stealing money makes you a bank robber. That’s what the words mean. Cancel culture is just a term used by people to put a cloak of respectability over the fact they want to be able to say offensive things without consequences. When I first started standup, I got a death threat and it was considered shocking and dangerous. Now comedians get death threats on Twitter all the time. It’s the same with so-called cancel culture, it’s water off a duck’s back. In the future maybe every comedian will be cancelled for 15 minutes; it can be worn as a badge of honour, and none of us will ever shut up about it. Shazia Mirza is a comedian.

12/24/2021,"In the middle of downtown Cairo is an anonymous-looking concrete building that stretches along one side of a huge landscaped roundabout. If you peer upwards, you’ll see it labelled, between rows of air-con units, in Arabic and English: “Opera office building and garage.” As monuments to past cultural glories go, it’s not a thing of beauty. But this block marks the site of the Khedivial Opera House – a venue erected in 1869 – and which, on 24 December 1871, staged the first performance of a new opera by the world’s then most famous composer: Giuseppe Verdi’s Aida. Today, Aida is one of the most regularly performed operas across the globe. Its just-add-pyramids ancient Egypt setting is as beloved by directors and audiences as Carmen’s Spain or Madama Butterfly’s Japan, almost always preserved as a spectacular backdrop for its conventional Italian-opera love story. Yet in recent decades Aida’s overt exoticism has attracted controversy. The Palestinian intellectual Edward Said argued that it was just another product of European imperialism – an opera that has had, he wrote in 1993, “an anaesthetic as well as informative effect on European audiences”.  Tempted to dismiss Said’s critique as outdated or too grandly abstract? Don’t be: in 2019 Aida made the news when the American soprano Tamara Wilson refused to wear blackface makeup to sing the title role at Italy’s Arena di Verona. I’ve loved Verdi’s score for as long as I’ve known anything about opera, but it’s impossible to ignore Aida’s problems today. Yet in Europe at least, the piece’s roots in 19th-century Cairo have been largely forgotten and Egyptian perspectives on it marginalised amid the liberal handwringing. Which is why, to mark the 150th anniversary of Aida’s world premiere, I’m standing next to roaring traffic in central Cairo, staring up at an office block in the hope of finding out what happened next. Not the familiar story of Aida’s popularity on the mainstages of Europe and North America – but the opera’s fate here in the Egyptian capital. Never an enthusiastic traveller, Verdi would probably not have appreciated the gesture. In fact he might have been pleased that the Egyptian origins of his “Egyptian” opera have mostly been forgotten. He confessed to a friend while working on Aida: “If anyone had told me two years ago, ‘You will write for Cairo’, I would have considered him a fool.” To another, he described ancient Egypt as “a civilisation I have never been able to admire.” No wonder the composer refused Egyptian ruler Khedive Isma’il Pasha’s initial request, for a hymn commemorating the new opera House’s official opening. “It is not my custom to compose occasional pieces,” Verdi explained icily. When the Khedive instead asked for a new “purely ancient and Egyptian opera”, promising a splendid staging, Verdi continued to play hard to get. Weighing up other options, the Opera House’s management reckoned ­that Richard Wagner “could do something grandiose”. But Wagner’s Aida remains one of music history’s great what-ifs: the 150,000-franc fee finally proved irresistible – though Verdi refused to travel to Cairo to supervise the premiere because he was “afraid of being mummified”. That joke’s conflation of contemporaneous and ancient Egypt is significant. Few cultures can match the powerful hold that ancient Egypt has had on the European imagination since 19th-century archaeologists scrambled to unearth monuments and bag treasures dating from pharaonic times. Aida’s setting was designed to capitalise on the fashionable world of pyramids, mummies and hieroglyphs. Like the archaeological excavations themselves, the opera’s historical spectacle drew its audience’s attention away from contemporary Egypt and instead focused minds on the country’s glorious past. As singing teacher and impresario Neveen Allouba puts it, “Aida shows the past of Egypt, it’s our history. And so we’re proud of that. But modern Egypt is so totally different.” In this city of 21 million inhabitants, vehicles jostle for space on smog-filled boulevards and car horns are a permanent feature of the soundscape. Arriving there in 2021 feels like plunging into the polyphonic thudding of a superclub. So has Aida become a historical relic in its own right? Magdy Saber, president of the current Cairo Opera House – opened in 1988 after fire destroyed the Khedivial Opera House – insists Aida still has modern-day meaning. “It’s very important to the history of the Egyptian military,” he explains, “because Radamès [Verdi’s tenor hero] is the head of the Egyptian military and when he commits a crime, he admits it – so it’s about the honour of the country’s history and at the same time the honour of the Egyptian military.” Meanwhile soprano Fatma Said – Egypt-born and a rising international star – tells me the opera’s Triumphal March is still used for university graduation ceremonies in Cairo. “We’re very, very proud of the music,” she says. Even though it was written by an Italian who refused to visit Egypt? “Art isn’t only about taking facts and putting it into music,” she argues. “It’s all about using our imagination. I think this is the most interesting part: how artistically involved these western artists [such as Verdi] were with the Middle East.” Ahmed El Maghraby, who runs a performance space dedicated to traditional Egyptian music, is less convinced. Aida is good for tourism, he admits. But celebrating the opera as one of modern Egypt’s cultural exponents? “Why should you play Aida when we have our own music?” Allouba, too, confesses she would love to see operas about “the real Egypt now, the real Egyptians – what is happening and the problems and the successes that we have through our life now”. But my assumption that ancient Egypt might feel like, well, ancient history to those growing up there today couldn’t have been more wrong. “When I was 12 or 13, I could see the pyramids from my house,” says Daniel, a twentysomething dentist and tenor-in-training. “We used to take taxis and we’d go to the pyramids. This is part of my identity.” Back at the roundabout where Cairo’s first opera house stood – still called Meidan El-Opera – I ask our taxi driver whether he’s ever seen Verdi’s Aida. “No.” Would he want to, I wonder? “Of course! Who wouldn’t?”  Aida at 150, presented by Flora Willson and produced by Steven Rajam, is on BBC Radio 3 at 19:15 on 26 December and then on BBC Sounds.",Arts/Music,Travesty or tragedy?
