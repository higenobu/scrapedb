5/4/2022,"How do you strip away cherished rights? The best strategy is incrementally and undramatically, a death of a thousand cuts. That’s how Republicans were hacking at voting rights until recently, when the rest of us woke up and began to pay attention to the cumulative impact of voter ID laws, the shuttering of polling places, restrictions on voting by mail, and all the rest. Reproductive rights have been under attack for more than 30 years – by rightwing terrorism against abortion providers all through the 1990s and as recently as 2015 in Colorado Springs, but also by a sort of attrition, narrowing down access by shutting clinics, limiting how many weeks pregnant you can be, and other such measures. Overturning Roe v Wade upends all this stealth and incrementalism. Judging by last night’s reaction, it may be exactly the kind of overstep that leads to a backlash. After all, the great majority of Americans support the right to choose. There are many kinds of actions to take in response to this likely overturning of a fundamental right to bodily self-determination and privacy. (And it’s bitterly amusing that a court that wants to set policies reaching into the uteruses of women across the country apparently feels violated by having its own internal workings exposed with this leaked draft opinion.) Direct support for the poor and unfree women who will be the most affected is already under way – and by unfree I mean those who are under the domination of a hostile partner, family, church or community. People have organized to offer travel to clinics for those far from them, access to abortion pills, and other forms of support. But by backlash I mean and am hoping for the kind of backlash Trump’s election and subsequent outrages provoked, the 2018 election that swept the Squad and many other progressives into office and took back the House of Representatives. A Democratic majority in both houses could make abortion a right by law, and it’s worth remembering that Mexico, Ireland and Argentina are among the countries that recently did so. What is striking this time around in the US both about the rightwing agenda and the response is that it is broad enough to build powerful coalitions. The human rights activism of the 1990s was siloed: though the same voters and politicians might support LGBTQ rights and reproductive rights and racial justice, largely separate campaigns were built around each of them, and the common denominators were seldom articulated. This time around – well, as I wrote when the news broke last night: “First they came for the reproductive rights (Roe v Wade, 1973) and it doesn’t matter if you don’t have a uterus in its ovulatory years, because then they want to come for the marriage rights of same-sex couples (Obergefell v Hodges, 2015), and then the rights of consenting adults of the same gender to have sex with each other (Lawrence v Texas, 2003), and then for the right to birth control (Griswold v Connecticut, 1965). It doesn’t really matter if they’re coming for you, because they’re coming for us.” “Us” these days means pretty much everyone who’s not a straight white Christian man with rightwing politics. They’re building a broad constituency of opposition, and it is up to us to make that their fatal mistake. It’s all connected. If Texas wasn’t suppressing voting rights so effectively, rightwing politicians might not be running the state. If non-Republican turnout can overcome the restrictions, Texas itself – now leading the attacks on abortion rights and trans rights – could elect Beto O’Rourke governor in November and turn Texas Democratic. O’Rourke tweeted today: “If they want states to decide, then we must elect a governor who will protect a woman’s right to abortion.” The right knows that it represents a minority and a shrinking minority as Americans as a whole become more progressive and as the country becomes increasingly non-white. They have made a desperate gamble – to rule via minority power, for the benefit of the few, which is why voter suppression is so crucial a part of their agenda. It cannot be a winning strategy in the long run. But in the short run it can perpetrate immense damage to too many lives and to the climate itself. Last night’s revelations should strengthen our resolve to resist by remembering our power and strengthening our alliances, winning elections, and keeping eyes on the prize.

5/4/2022,"The beginning of May before midterm elections marks the start of primary season and six months of fall campaigning. The conventional view this year is that Democrats will be clobbered in November. Why? Because midterms are usually referendums on a president’s performance, and Biden’s approval ratings are in the cellar. But the conventional view could be wrong because it doesn’t account for the Democrat’s secret sauce, which gives them a fighting chance of keeping one or both chambers: Trump. According to recent polls, Trump’s popularity continues to sink. He is liked by only 38% of Americans and disliked by 46%. (12% are neutral.) And this isn’t your normal “sort of like, sort of dislike” polling. Feelings are intense, as they’ve always been about Trump. Among voters 45 to 64 years old – a group Trump won in 2020, 50% to 49%, according to exit polls – just 39% now view him favorably and 57%, unfavorably. Among voters 65 and older (52% of whom voted for him in 2020 to Biden’s 47) only 44% now see him favorably and more than half (54%) unfavorably. Perhaps most importantly, independents hold him in even lower regard. Just 26% view him favorably; 68% unfavorably. Republican lawmakers had hoped – and assumed – Trump would have faded from the scene by now, allowing them to engage in full-throttled attacks on Democrats in the lead-up to the midterms. No such luck. In fact, Trump’s visibility is growing daily. The media is framing this month’s big Republican primaries as all about Trump – which is exactly as Trump wants them framed. But this framing is disastrous for Republicans. The Republican Ohio primary, for example, became a giant proxy battle over who was the Trumpiest candidate. The candidates outdid each other trying to imitate him – railing against undocumented immigrants, coastal elites, “socialism”, and “wokeness”, all the while regurgitating the Big Lie that Democrats stole the 2020 presidential election. Whether Trump’s endorsements pay off in wins for his chosen primary candidates is beside the point. By making these races all about him, Trump and the media are casting the midterms as a whole as a referendum on Trump’s continuing power and influence. This is exactly what the Democrats need. June’s televised hearings of the House January 6 committee will likely show in detail how Trump and his White House orchestrated the attack on the US Capitol, and rekindle memories of Trump’s threat to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless Ukrainian president Zelensky came up with dirt on Biden. But the real significance of the hearings won’t show up in Trump’s approval ratings. It will be in the heightened reminders of Trump’s reign in Washington, as well as Trump’s closeness to Putin. The result is an almost certain shift in marginal voters’ preferences toward the Democrats in November. The leaked decision by the supreme court to uphold Mississippi’s ban on abortions after 15 weeks and reverse Roe v Wade – courtesy of Trump’s three Court nominees – will green-light other Republican states to enact similar or even tighter bans, and spur Republicans in Congress to push for national legislation to bar abortions across the country. Republicans believe this will ignite their base, but it’s more likely to ignite a firestorm among the vast majority of Americans who believe abortion should be legal. Score more Democratic votes. There is also the possibility of criminal trials over Trump’s business and electoral frauds – such as his brazen attempt to change the Georgia vote tally – whose significance will be less about whether Trump is found guilty than additional reminders, in the months before the midterms, of Trump’s brazen lawlessness. Meanwhile, Trump will treat America to more rallies, interviews and barnstorming to convince voters the 2020 election was stolen from him, along with incessant demands that Republican candidates reiterate his Big Lie. More help to Democrats. Somewhere along the line, and also before the midterms, Elon Musk is likely to allow Trump back on Twitter. The move will be bad for America – fueling more racism, xenophobia and division. But it will serve as another memento of how dangerously incendiary Trump and Trumpism continue to be. Accompanying all of this will be the ongoing antics of Trump’s whacky surrogates – Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, Steve Bannon, Madison Cawthorn, Trump Junior, et al – who mimic Trump’s bravado, bigotry, divisiveness, and disdain for the law. All are walking billboards for Trumpism’s heinous impact on American life. All will push wavering voters toward Democrats in November. I’m not suggesting Democrats seeking election or re-election center their campaigns around Trump. To the contrary, Democrats need to show voters their continuing commitment to improving voters’ lives. Between now and November, Democrats should enact laws to help Americans afford childcare, cut the costs of prescription drugs, and stop oil companies from price gouging, for example. But Democrats can also count on Americans’ reawakened awareness of the hatefulness and chaos Trump and his Republican enablers have unleashed. And it’s this combination – Democrats scoring some additional victories for average Americans, and Trump and others doing everything possible to recollect his viciousness – that could well reverse conventional wisdom about midterms, and keep Democrats in control.

5/4/2022,"Will Americans ever stop killing wolves? We stopped commercially hunting whales, and the mass slaughter of bison. We no longer clearcut old-growth redwoods, or use explosives on prairie dog towns, or build massive dams on wild salmon rivers. We no longer kill egrets and herons to adorn women’s hats with their feathers. So why shoot and trap wolves, God’s dog, the forebear of all our beloved domestic dogs? Why destroy an animal that is playful, cooperative, cunning, giving, loving, predatory, faithful, intelligent, savage and social and dedicated to family? Not unlike us. Over the past few years, as the US Fish & Wildlife Service delisted the gray wolf as an endangered species, many states enacted laws to reduce wolf numbers, some that permitted wolves to be chased on all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles, and caught by snares. Idaho earmarked $200,000 to kill 90% of its wolves. More than 200 were killed in less than 60 hours in Wisconsin. In recent months, more than 500 wolves have been destroyed in the northern Rockies, including roughly one-fifth of those that frequent Yellowstone National Park, a prized population studied in great detail since wolves were re-introduced there beginning in 1995, after a 70-year-absence. Because of how wolf packs have revitalized the park, Yellowstone today represents a rewilding and ecological renaissance admired around the world. And this recent killing spree “is a huge setback,” the wildlife biologist Doug Smith told Science. In southwest Montana, adjacent to Yellowstone, where anti-wolf bumper stickers say “Smoke a pack a day,” hunting and trapping ended when the total number of kills hit a threshold. Not since wolves were shot, trapped and poisoned to near-extinction a century ago has the US seen such a vigorous assault on its poster apex predator. Ranchers and hunters detest wolves for taking their livestock and big game. Conservationists prize them as essential for ecosystem health, and say wolves aren’t nearly as abundant and wide-ranging today as they once were. Hated by some, loved by others, wolves polarize us. Why? Autumn 1909. A few months out of Yale Forest School, 22-year-old Aldo Leopold sits eating his lunch on a rimrock in Apache National Forest, Arizona Territory, when he and a fellow Forest Service employee spot an animal far below, crossing a river. A deer? No – not a deer. When the animal reaches the riverbank and shakes itself dry, several pups bound out from golden willows to greet her, their tails high. Wolves! The young men grab their rifles and begin shooting. When the gunsmoke clears, they clamber down to inspect their work. Many of the pups are dead. One drags itself over scree rocks, bleeding, trying to escape. But it’s the mother that Leopold will never forget. “We reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes. I realized then, and have known ever since, that there was something new to me in those eyes – something known only to her and the mountain. I was young then, and full of trigger itch; I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, that no wolves would be a hunters’ paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view.” Beginning as far back as 1630, wolf bounties did their job, allaying fears that wolves would kill livestock – or worse, eat settler’s children. Valley after valley, state by state, wolves were extirpated across a young, growing nation. In 1890, the US Bureau of the Census showed the “unsettled” American frontier – places with a population density of less than two people per square mile – gone. The historian Frederick Jackson Turner said this was significant because “the democracy born of free land, strong in selfishness and individualism, intolerant of administrative experience and education, and pressing individual freedom beyond its proper bounds, has its dangers as well as its benefits.” Today’s American wolf killers – who say they prize life and liberty – eagerly kill an animal that embodies life and liberty. An animal that does not kill children, and at most takes only a small percentage of cattle and sheep. Cattle and sheep some ranchers raise on US public land. Cattle that belch methane and are “a worldwide curse,” according to the author and wilderness advocate Doug Peacock. Sheep that are “hoofed locusts,” according to the great naturalist John Muir. Might these same ranchers ever consider the rich human cultures that preceded them; that lived light on the land, strung no barbed wire, and seldom if ever killed wolves? Might a rancher have a crisis of conscience? An epiphany as Leopold had? “What did you learn today?” Leopold would ask his children at the dinner table. Not what did you do but what did you learn – a big difference. By then an admired professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he would take his family north where they owned a cabin (an upgraded chicken coop they lovingly called “the shack”) and the kids could run and play wild and free. Like wolves. Three of Aldo and his wife Estella’s five children were ultimately elected to the National Academy of Sciences, an unequaled achievement for an American family. When wolves returned to Yellowstone in the mid-1990s, they created what ecologists call a “trophic cascade.” The wolves killed some animals, but enlivened the park in ways that thrilled, informed and inspired millions. Deer and elk became more alert and on-the-move; where they had over-browsed and -grazed, aspens and willows now prospered. Songbirds returned. Soil erosion decreased. Beavers spread from one colony to nine, and built new dams and ponds. Even the rivers changed, with deeper channels, more riffles and shaded pools – better habitat for amphibians, fish and ducks. All because of wolves? It’s an ongoing debate, one filled with “competing and very complex arguments,” says Doug Smith. One thing is certain, however: wolves made the park wilder. Recently, a federal judge reinstated wolf protections in 44 states, but not in the northern Rockies around Yellowstone. Conservation groups have asked US Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland for an emergency relisting of the northern Rockies gray wolf under the Endangered Species Act. Or better, a national Carnivore Conservation Act to end the cycles of listing, delisting, killing and relisting to permanently protect wolves, cougars, coyotes, grizzly bears and black bears. When he died in 1948, at age 61, Leopold had just completed writing a book that would become his masterpiece, A Sand County Almanac. “That land is a community is the basic concept of ecology,” he wrote, “but that land is to be loved and respected is an extension of ethics.” Wolves deserve our protection. They have ecosystems to heal, rivers to restore. Kim Heacox writes frequently for The Guardian about the climate crisis, biodiversity loss and threats to US public lands.

5/4/2022,"The first word that would pop into your brain to describe this drama, based on actual events, is “timely”. But, tragically, that means little given the regularity with which people die at the hands of US police, either by accident or design. The killing at the centre of director David Midell’s almost unbearably tense film happened in White Plains, NY, in 2011. However, as there are only audio recordings, forensic reports and witness statements to document what happened, Chamberlain’s death didn’t capture the public imagination in the same way that George Floyd’s or Breonna Taylor’s did in 2020, for example. Viewers might care to discuss the difference between such cases’ circumstances and the times in which they happened, but one of the film’s more audacious qualities is that it just leaves such debate to us, choosing to simply depict the events as gathered from investigators and witnesses. It’s probably best absorbed by knowing as little about the story as possible, other than that Chamberlain (played with exceptional skill by Frankie Faison) was a 68-year-old African American former marine with a heart condition and mental health issues. Chamberlain accidentally pressed his health alarm in the middle of the night, which set in motion a fatal encounter with police. There’s a bit of text at the end that fills in a little of the story’s background and outcome, but the drama cleaves entirely to staging a faithful reconstruction of the events, practically in real time. It’s almost like an American true-crime version of The Death of Mr Lazarescu, Cristi Puiu’s canonical contribution to the Romanian new wave, but with a suspense-building musical underscore. Playing policemen with their own contrasting approaches to the situation, Steve O’Connell and Enrico Natale offer sturdy support to Faison’s indelible, wrenching, but entirely unsentimental star turn.

5/4/2022,"On 20 October, 1966, 10-year-old Eryl Mai Jones, from Aberfan in south Wales, told her mother about a dream she’d had the night before. “I dreamt I went to school and there was no school there,” she said. “Something black had come down all over it.” The next day, at 9.14am, a colliery waste tip came crashing down the hillside, smothering the village school and the surrounding houses. Eryl Mai was among the 144 dead. Visiting Aberfan in the days after the tragedy was John Barker, a 42-year-old psychiatrist and superintendent of a large mental hospital in Shropshire who had an interest in “psychiatric orchids”, or unusual mental conditions. Barker had conducted studies on Munchausen syndrome, sufferers of which are known to feign illness, and was in the midst of researching Scared to Death, a book about people who accurately foretold their own deaths. Eryl Mai Jones wasn’t the only child to anticipate the tragedy at Aberfan: the day before, an eight-year-old boy, Paul Davies, had drawn a picture of a mass of figures digging at a hillside accompanied by the words “The End”. Barker was so struck by their portents that he wrote to Peter Fairley, science editor at London’s Evening Standard, and asked him to publish an appeal requesting that anyone who had experienced premonitions of Aberfan to get in touch. They received 76 replies. In The Premonitions Bureau, a strange and gripping account of Barker’s adventures in precognition, the journalist Sam Knight writes: “Premonitions are impossible, and they come true all the time. The second law of thermodynamics says it can’t happen, but you think of your mother a second before she calls.” His book – an expansion of a New Yorker article published in 2019 – blends history and popular science with biography as it plots the career of Barker, a highly respected doctor who was also a member of Britain’s Society for Psychical Research, founded in 1882 to investigate paranormal happenings. The rational response to premonitions is that they are a coincidence. We tend to make predictions and look for patterns, since the idea that life is random is just too bleak to countenance. Yet, Knight observes, “we resist meaning almost as often as we insist upon it. We refuse its presence to make life simpler and to spare ourselves … Letting things go, surrendering to chance, is its own narrative act but we talk about it much less.” Another rational response to premonitions is that they are based on the most likely outcomes. During the public inquiry into Aberfan, it was revealed how the disaster had been preceded by other tip slides in the area. A local government engineer had twice written to the National Coal Board about the danger posed by tip number seven on the village school below. But this doesn’t account for the dreams and drawings of young children, or indeed the experience of Kathleen Middleton, a music and ballet teacher from Edmonton in London, who, on the morning of the disaster, “awoke choking and gasping and with the sense of the walls caving in.” After their initial inquiry about Aberfan, Barker and Fairley decided to broaden their study. In early 1967, they opened the Premonitions Bureau, where people would be able to send their dreams and forebodings, which would then be monitored for accuracy. They received hundreds of replies, most of them clearly bogus; most, but not all. Middleton, for whom portents were a regular occurrence, was one of the Bureau’s star correspondents – whenever her premonitions proved correct, Barker would write and congratulate her. Another, Alan Hencher, a post office telephone operator, successfully predicted a plane crash in Cyprus right down to the number of the dead. Hencher and Middleton separately foretold a fatal rail crash in Britain days before a train from Hastings was derailed on its way to London, killing 49 passengers. Barker and Fairley’s ultimate plan was to present the Bureau’s findings to the Medical Research Council, with a view to setting up an official national early warning system, though their proposal had an obvious flaw: if a catastrophe is foretold and then fails to materialise, any visions that might have preceded it would appear to be fantasy. And how can an event that doesn’t happen yield a vision in the first place? Knight tells Barker’s story in lucid, no-nonsense prose, portraying him as compassionate and progressive, with a clear stubborn streak and a taste for the limelight (his research made eye-catching headlines and he was a regular on BBC science programmes). That the author neither endorses the claims of seers (or “percipients” as Barker called them) nor dismisses them as cranks, is exactly as it should be, though it means the book’s underlying inquiry – can the human mind really see into the future? – is yet to be put to bed. Nonetheless, the most hardened sceptic can’t fail to be electrified by the stories of ordinary citizens assuaged by visions of earthquakes, tornadoes, collapsing buildings and planes falling out of the sky, and the eminent physician in their thrall. The final chapter brings a doozy of a plot twist that stretches all rational responses to breaking point.

5/4/2022,"Boohoo has admitted its clothing prices are likely to rise this year after profits almost halved amid weakening consumer demand and rising costs. The online fashion specialist said pre-tax profits fell 94% to £7.8m in the year to 28 February. Sales rose 14% to almost £2bn but growth was down more than 40% in the previous year, as deliveries overseas were held up by disruption to international shipping and wavering demand during the pandemic. The cost of shipping and flying in goods from factories was up £22m, while the bill for posting them out to customers rose £38m. Marketing costs also soared as Boohoo relaunched new brands bought during the pandemic including Debenhams, Dorothy Perkins and Burton. Profits and sales took a hit as customers returned more unwanted items than they had during the pandemic lockdowns, when the group sold more stretchy garments, such as leggings and hoodies, where an exact fit was less important. The company said it expected to continue to face increased costs in the year ahead and was aiming to “maximise efficiencies”, including adding more automation at its warehouses, to help cut costs “before passing prices on to consumers”. It said sales growth was likely to drop to less than 5% for the year to February 2023 amid “uncertain consumer demand” and ongoing problems with transporting goods around the world. Sales are expected to fall until the end of May and then to recover somewhat. Shares in Boohoo dived more than 10% on Wednesday morning to 71.6p, as analysts said they expected Boohoo’s underlying profits for the year ahead to be about 18% below previous expectations. Boohoo said in a statement: “We remain extremely confident in the group’s future growth prospects, and as short-term demand uncertainty and material cost headwinds as a result of the pandemic unwind, the group’s belief that it continues to be capable of executing its strategy aimed at leading the fashion e-commerce market remains unchanged.” Julie Palmer, a partner at analysts Begbies Traynor, said: “Boohoo has been hit by lower demand in key markets, long delivery times and higher return rates, and is also facing up to rising shipping costs, spiralling wage bills and more expensive materials. “The outlook isn’t pretty, with inflation a real concern for this outfit, and falling consumer confidence may mean customers thinking twice before refreshing their wardrobes as we head into summer. “Throw in the costs of a new factory in Leicester after allegations two years ago the company wasn’t paying workers the minimum wage, along with spending on new distribution centres as it prepares for hoped-for expansion, and Boohoo has a lot of ground to make up.”",News/Business,Boohoo likely to raise prices after pre-tax profits fall 94%,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/boohoo-likely-to-raise-prices-after-pre-tax-profits-fell-94
5/4/2022,"Welcome to The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly (and free) cricket newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version every Wednesday, just pop your email in below. An extreme heatwave sits over southern Asia, hitting early and without precedent. March was the hottest in India since records began 122 years ago. In Delhi, temperatures are expected to pass 44C this week; in Pakistan’s Balochistan region, the mercury has been touching 50C for some time. Crops are failing and there are power shortages as the demand for electricity soars. Uncontrollable fires are breaking out, including in landfill sites on the outskirts of Delhi, adding to the toxic air. The Indian Premier League continues regardless. Last week the Royal Challengers Bangalore captain, Faf du Plessis, talked about the challenges of playing in such debilitating conditions. “I take a lot of fluids before the game,” he said. “We practised today and it was very, very hot. It’s good to get your body used to what you are going to get with respect to the conditions. But also, on the day, it is very important to try and manage the intensity. When it is very hot, like it is at the moment, you have got to make sure you conserve as much as you can.” “For instance, when you’re batting,” agreed the RCB bowler Harshal Patel, “when there’s a definite two, you try and take a two, but when there’s not a definite two, just try and conserve some energy.” The 2019 Hit for Six report examined the physical and psychological risks to cricketers from intense heat, from heatstroke to impaired decision-making. It pointed to the particular dangers to athletes of high wet-bulb temperatures, which measure how well humans cool down by sweating when it’s hot and humid. A wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) of more than 35C is deadly – last week it hit 29C in cities in West Bengal and Odisha. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that extreme caution is taken with any continuous exercise with a WBGT of 23C and over. Among other things, Hit for Six suggested that countries came up with heat rules, heat-resistant clothing and reminded governing bodies they had a duty of care to children, who are less able to regulate their body temperatures and have none of the resources of IPL teams, with physios on hand to ensure the players are properly hydrated, have prepared properly and can cool down their core temperatures with ice towels handed to them on the boundary. Disha Shetty, a science journalist based in south Asia and a reporter for The Fuller Project, sees a real lack of engagement with the dangers of climate change. “We are having some conversations about why our school students are stepping out in that heat, but it needs a lot more engagement on the public health side, as well as decision-makers across different sectors, including sports administrators. Extreme heat, coupled with dehydration, can be deadly. “I think in developing countries we have had a tendency to not invest much in public health but the climate crisis is a public health crisis. While this is understood in climate circles and public health circles, it isn’t acknowledged much outside of that. We have to have big conversations on how we manage sports facilities given both the high air pollution levels in south Asia and now the extreme heat. At the moment we just kind of live with it but there are certain things we are just not going to be able to live with and heatwaves will be one of them.” In late April the Indian PFA wrote to the Indian Football Association, asking it to reschedule matches that were set to kick off at 3pm in the state of West Bengal with temperatures sitting at around 40C: “The health ministry’s notification states that people should stay indoors during this heatwave … it is rather sad and unfortunate that the Federation and the league organisers of the country have no concern on the health hazard faced by professional footballers playing in these extreme conditions.” In India, though, it is cricketers, not footballers, who have voices loud enough to reach government – just as Marcus Rashford was able to in the UK over free school meals. For Shetty, cricketing voices could be crucial in increasing both action and understanding. “Cricketers in India have a lot of clout, a lot of following, and it would help tremendously if they would talk more about climate and environmental issues. I also wonder how sustainable sports will be in this changing climate. Cricket is a low-cost way of entertainment and joy but it is played out in the open and in a heating world that is going to be increasingly problematic.” Sherry Rehman, Pakistan’s minister for climate, told the Guardian Pakistan was facing an “existential crisis” – one that links it with India and other countries in the global south who are and will be experiencing the climate emergency disproportionately to their historic emissions. “I see a distinct difference in the way this heatwave is covered in the Indian media and the western media,” says Shetty. “In the western media, questions are centred around what should Indian and Pakistan leaders do, whereas in the Indian media we are talking a lot more about equity and how the rest of the world is going to have to reduce its carbon emissions. “We are talking about what historically high carbon emitters are going to do to help those without that footprint – a conversation that I don’t see a lot of western publications having. In terms of climate change, the solutions are going to be global and not just something the developing world has to grapple with. Global climate emissions have to be brought down, not just in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.” This idea was touched upon in the Hit for Six report, when it suggested the ICC set up a global climate fund to help countries particularly hit by the climate crisis.

5/4/2022,"Good morning. Joe Biden has warned that a leaked draft supreme court ruling overturning Roe v Wade, the 1973 case that guaranteed the right to abortion, would represent a huge change in America law and could imperil a wide range of other civil rights. In a historic moment that shook the US to the core and highlighted jagged social and political divisions, the court confirmed the draft was authentic but said it did not “represent a decision by the court or the final position of any member on the issues in the case”. The US president called the provisional court opinion “radical” and said the ruling, if handed down, would represent a “fundamental shift in American jurisprudence” and could imperil rights including same-sex marriage and access to contraception. Politico published the draft by justice Samuel Alito on Monday night. The website said the draft was supported by four other rightwingers on a panel conservatives control 6-3. What’s the reaction been like? As news broke, demonstrators gathered in major cities across the US. There were tears and tension as protesters swarmed outside the US supreme court to voice their outrage. How soon could US states outlaw abortions if Roe v Wade is overturned? While the draft could still change, if it is not substantially altered it would result in 26 states immediately or as soon as practicable banning abortion, a sea change in the American legal and political landscape. How significant is a leak of a draft supreme court ruling? The Guardian’s Washington correspondent, David Smith, called the leak “stunning and unprecedented” and said it would be the worst security breach in the court’s history. Ursula von der Leyen has proposed a total ban on Russian oil imports to the EU, saying Vladimir Putin had to pay a “high price for his brutal aggression” in Ukraine. Member states in Brussels are scrutinising a proposed sixth package of sanctions, but in a speech on Wednesday the European Commission president said Russian oil flows had to stop. Von der Leyen said Russian supply of crude oil would be prohibited within six months and refined products would be banned by the end of the year, while she acknowledged the demands from countries such as Slovakia and Hungary for additional flexibility. “Let us be clear: it will not be easy,” Von der Leyen said in a speech to the European parliament. “Some member states are strongly dependent on Russian oil. But we simply have to work on it. We now propose a ban on Russian oil. This will be a complete import ban on all Russian oil, seaborne and pipeline, crude and refined. What else is happening? More than 100 evacuees who managed to leave the besieged city of Mariupol – many trapped under the Azovstal steel plant – reached the relative safety of Ukraine-controlled Zaporizhzhia. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed in his latest national address 156 people, mainly women and children, were successfully evacuated. What else do we know? Here’s a roundup of everything we know on day 70 of the invasion. Author JD Vance won the Senate Republican primary in Ohio yesterday, securing a victory after receiving Donald Trump’s endorsement in the hotly contested race. Vance was leading the crowded pack of primary candidates with 32% of the vote when the Associated Press called the race, about two hours after polls closed. Former state treasurer Josh Mandel looked likely to finish second, and state Senator Matt Dolan, who had a last-minute surge in support, rounded out the top three. Addressing supporters in Cincinnati, Vance thanked Trump for his endorsement and attacked the media for highlighting his past criticism of the former president. “They wanted to write a story that this campaign would be the death of Donald Trump’s America First agenda,” Vance said. “It ain’t the death of the America First agenda.” Vance, the bestselling author of the memoir Hillbilly Elegy, will face Democratic congressman Tim Ryan in November to determine who will fill the seat of retiring Republican Senator Rob Portman. Why is this race so important? The Ohio race could prove crucial in determining control of the Senate, as Republicans look to retake the upper chamber this November. The Senate is evenly split 50-50, but Democrats have the majority thanks to the tie-breaking vote of Kamala Harris. Democratic lawmakers in more than a dozen states are following California’s lead in seeking to offer legal refuge to displaced transgender youth and their families. The coordinated effort, which was announced yesterday, comes in response to recent actions taken in conservative states. A death row inmate in Arizona has two weeks to choose his preferred method of death – either lethal injection or hydrogen cyanide, a poisonous gas made notorious by the Nazis as a mass killing technique during the Holocaust. Atwood’s lawyers are scrambling to try to persuade him not to opt for cyanide. The first major study since Brexit of UK citizens living in the EU has revealed its profound impact on their lives, with many expressing serious concerns over free movement and voting rights – and a very different perception of Britain. Some said they felt “deep shame” and were now “embarrassed to be British”. North Korea launched a suspected ballistic missile toward its eastern waters today, South Korean and Japanese officials said, a few days after the North Korean ruler, Kim Jong-un, vowed to bolster his nuclear arsenal “at the fastest possible pace”. As a leaked document signals that the US supreme court is poised to strike down the landmark 1973 ruling in Roe v Wade, millions of American women face losing their access to legal abortions, joining millions more living in those countries rejecting a woman’s right to choose. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), unsafe abortions kill more than 47,000 people every year, with 5 million hospitalised for complications such as bleeding or infection. Jim DeRogatis began reporting on the R Kelly’s abuse of Black women and girls back in 2000. The Chicago Sun-Times music critic has received an anonymous fax telling him that “Robert’s problem – and it’s a thing that goes back many years – is young girls.” DeRogatis and his colleague Abdon Pallasch began digging, and thus began one of the longest-running investigations in journalism, and the most influential. So why were the revelations ignored for so long? New Mexico’s governor asked President Joe Biden to declare a disaster as firefighters scrambled to clear brush, build fire lines and spray water to keep the largest blaze burning in the US from destroying more homes in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham said it was important that the declaration be made on the front end rather than waiting until the fire is out. The blaze has already charred 228 sq miles (590 sq km) of mountainsides, destroying around 170 homes in its path. An investigation into an “extraordinary breach of security” is under way after an intruder pretending to be a priest reportedly spent the night eating and drinking with soldiers at a barracks close to Windsor Castle in England, which is the Queen’s main residence. Police were alerted to reports of an intruder at Victoria Barracks on Sheet Street, Windsor, on Wednesday, while the Queen was at Sandringham, another residence, for Easter.

5/4/2022,"Aston Martin has appointed its third chief executive in three years, with Tobias Moers stepping down after only two years in charge. Moers will leave the board of the British carmaker with immediate effect but will stay until the end of July to “support the leadership team with a smooth transition”, Aston Martin Lagonda announced. The former Ferrari boss Amedeo Felisa will replace him as chief executive. Felisa joined Aston Martin’s board as a non-executive director in July 2021. Aston Martin, known as the maker of sports cars used in the James Bond film franchise, has gone through many turbulent periods in its 109-year history. Its latest problems began with a stock market listing in 2018 that quickly went sour as high listing costs forced it to look for new funding. The fashion billionaire Lawrence Stroll stepped in to bail out the company in early 2020, forcing out the former Nissan chief operating officer Andy Palmer and poaching Moers from Daimler’s high-performance unit, Mercedes-AMG, to take over. Moers has overseen a period of retrenchment by Aston Martin, as it sought to reduce the number of cars left with dealers – which Stroll saw as a key step to restore an element of exclusivity to the brand even as it tries to more than double sales to 10,000 a year. However, financial results for the first three months of 2022 showed the company continued to struggle. Losses before tax for the quarter almost tripled to £112m. It made revenues of £232m, suggesting a long way to go to hit its target of £2bn annually. Felisa, who led the Italian maker of sports cars Ferrari for eight years as chief executive, will oversee the electrification of Aston Martin’s range, and will reorganise the company’s structure and make appointments in the coming weeks. Among those is Roberto Fedeli, another former Ferrari executive announced as Aston Martin’s chief technical officer on Wednesday. Stroll, who has the role of executive chair, said Moers “joined Aston Martin at a critical time for the company and brought significant discipline to its operations. The benefit of these actions is clear in the improved operating performance of the company and in our great new product launches. “Now, there is a need for the business to enter a new phase of growth with a new leadership team and structure to ensure we deliver on our goals.” Stroll said Felisa has “extensive knowledge of both Aston Martin’s business and the wider automotive industry with an excellent track record and previous experience of leading a major ultra-luxury car manufacturer”.",News/Business,Aston Martin appoints third CEO in three years as Tobias Moers steps down,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/aston-martin-appoints-third-ceo-in-three-years-as-tobias-moers-steps-down
