2/10/2022,"A Giant bull moose spent an hour trampling a dog sled team in Alaska even after the owner emptied her gun into the animal. Bridgett Watkins and her team of dogs were attacked by the moose last week while on a 52-mile run, leaving three dogs needing surgery. ""This has been the most horrific past 24 hours of my life,"" Watkins said in a Facebook post. As the giant moose charged at her and her team, Watkins shot the animal, but it didn't stop him from stomping on the dogs, according to the post. ""I ran for my life and prayed I was fast enough to not be killed in that moment,"" she wrote. After she and a friend trailing her took refuge behind her snowmobile, the moose charged at them and stopped 2 feet in front of the machine. She was able to cut six dogs free, but the moose went back over to continue trampling them for nearly an hour. ""I have never felt so helpless in my life. He would not leave us alone and he even stood over top of the team refusing to retreat,"" Watkins wrote. Some of Watkins' friends arrived at their location and were able to kill the moose, but four dogs sustained serious injuries.

2/10/2022,"This was more than a monster truck trying to squeeze into a compact parking space. A Celebrity cruise ship that stopped in Key West over the weekend jutted out into a passageway used by the Navy. And the Naval Air Station Key West says the ship partially blocked the entrance to the Navy’s Truman Harbor. By exceeding the boundary line, the 1,004-foot Celebrity Apex’s mooring was more than a bad parking job at the privately run Pier B. “Any activity that restricts or prohibits vessel transit in or out of the Harbor impacts our defense mission capabilities there,” said Trice Denny, a spokeswoman for Naval Air Station Key West. “The violation is that it’s past the boundaries of the submerged land lease in the deed and it juts out into the opening into Truman Harbor,” Denny said. “We need all that opening space to safely maneuver vessels in and out of the harbor.” The Naval Air Station said it has drafted a notification of the violation to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, which has a lease with the dock’s private owner, Pier B Development Corp., that allows cruise ships to dock. The notice is working its way through the Navy’s administrative process. “The next step is up to the state,” Denny said. Representatives of the state Department of Environmental Protection did not respond to emailed messages on Wednesday seeking more information and comment. Asked about the mooring incident, a manager for Pier B said that it “followed up to correct any issues on docking location.” “We have a good working relationship with the city, Navy and harbor pilots,” Tom McMurrain, manager of Pier B, said in a statement. “The harbor pilots bring in cruise ships as well as some of the Navy vessels so we all work together in the Harbor to insure the proper docking of ships.” Naval Air Station Key West considers harbor access on a case-by-case basis, Denny said. Federal regulations give access control to the station’s commanding officer. Cruise critics in Key West seized the chance to denounce Celebrity over the mooring controversy, which happened the day after a protest at Mallory Square to greet the arrival of another ship, the Celebrity Constellation. Some posted photos of the Apex’s mooring, including Safer Cleaner Ships, the group behind three referendums that easily passed in 2020 to drastically restrict cruise ship traffic to the island — including banning the largest ships altogether. But state legislators put a stop to those changes. In June 2021, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation that overturned the voters’ decision. Those voters want the city and Pier B to stick to the terms of the referendums: Ban cruise ships with more than 1,300 passengers from docking in Key West and limit the total number of people, both passengers and crew, who can disembark each day to 1,500. This week, in light of the Apex’s mooring, Safer Cleaner Ships asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to immediately suspend cruise ship docking at Pier B and to revoke the permit it granted to the company. The arrival of the Apex, which can carry 2,910 passengers, is part of a pattern, the group says. They have rounded up a list of 350 violations of the lease’s limits on ship length and width between 2016 and 2022. The list includes upcoming scheduled ships. Pier B has accepted the most cruise ships in Key West since the cruise industry resumed business last year after the industry shut down in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the ships at Pier B do qualify under the referendum’s limits, Arlo Haskell, a founder of Safer Cleaner Ships. “They’ve been busy,” Haskell said of Pier B. “They’ve had a number of smaller ships that qualify but lately they have been bringing in these giant ones. If the Corps takes the action they’re required to do by permit, it will shut down cruise operations at Pier B.” On Saturday, the day before the Apex moored at Pier B, a few hundred people turned out to protest large cruise ships docking in Key West, two years after the Key West referendum vote. “No big ships! No big ships! No big ships!” the crowd chanted while gathered at the city-owned Mallory Square on Saturday. Some held handmade signs: “Save our reef,” and “KW voted no.” One man held one that read, “Floating toilets go away.” The square was filled with large flags bearing the blue, white and yellow Safer Cleaner Ships logo. Cruise ship critics also took to the water on boats. During the protest, the 965-foot Celebrity Constellation loomed large as a backdrop, docked at Pier B. No elected officials were seen at the protest. “There’s no politician, there’s nobody coming to our rescue in the Florida Keys,” said Will Benson, a flats fishing guide and a founder of Safer Cleaner Ships. “I’ve been working these issues for a long time and they don’t care.” Key West is home to three piers that can accept cruise ships, and the city manages two of them. Pier B is owned by the Walsh family of Delray Beach, along with the Opal Key Resort and Marina behind it facing Front Street. Pier B leases from the state the bay bottom below the saltwater. Locals question whether Pier B owns the pier outright. But the Monroe County property appraiser says it’s privately owned. “The pier is privately owned, yes,” said Phillip Nguyen, a geographical information systems specialist for the Monroe County Property Appraiser’s Office. “They lease the bay bottom from the government.” There is a submerged land lease in place between the company and the state, meaning the bay bottom. Two companies with Pier B in their names are recorded legally as the warranty deed holders. Nguyen said the dock is made up of two parts owned by separate companies: Pier B Development Corp. and Pier Bravo Development Corp., both owned by the Walsh family, according to state records posted online. Mallory Square, which the city owns, is next door. The city has also leased the Navy’s Outer Mole pier to bring in cruise ships.

2/10/2022,"MOUNTAIN BROOK, Ala. (AP) — A Jewish high school student said he couldn't believe what was going on when a history teacher in a wealthy Alabama school system had classmates stand and give a stiff-armed Nazi salute during a lesson on the way symbols change. Once he shared a video and photos of the incident on social media, Ephraim Tytell said, he received a reprimand from school administrators in Mountain Brook, a suburb of Birmingham. “They proceeded to tell me that I’m making Mountain Brook look bad for uploading the video and sharing it and asked me to apologize to my teacher, which I refused to,” he told WIAT-TV. “The day after, he made our class, and our class only, put up our phones and he moved me from sitting in the back of the class to right next to him.” First reported by the Birmingham-based Southern Jewish Life, the incident last month gained traction on social media. On Tuesday, the school system issued a statement saying the video and photos shared online “are not representative of the lesson” and no one tried to teach students how to do a Nazi salute. “Understanding the sensitive nature of this subject, Mountain Brook Schools has addressed the instructional strategy used with the teacher and does not condone the modeling of this salute when a picture or video could accurately convey the same message,” the statement said. A system spokesman did not immediately return an email Wednesday seeking additional comment. The point of the lesson, Tytell said, was that something very similar to what’s now widely known as a Nazi salute was used before World War II to salute the U.S. flag. Called the “Bellamy Salute” for decades, it was ditched in 1942 for the now-familiar right-hand-over-the-heart gesture after the United States’ entry into the war. “He explained to us that in America we used to do that before WWII and everything, and then he proceeded to show us, ask us to stand up to salute the flag, and he and everyone else did the Nazi salute,” Ephraim said. “I felt upset, unsure of what’s going on —just kind of shocked.” Mountain Brook Listens, a group that works to promote diversity in the virtually all-white city of 22,000, issued a statement saying the incident showed the need for more resources, education and training on understanding implicit biases, building empathy and acting with more compassion. “And our entire community, including our school system, must foster an environment where people feel safe to report behavior that they are concerned about and certainly not create an environment that cultivates any ‘fear of reprisal,’” it said. The controversy comes just months after Mountain Brook’s school system responded to community complaints about a diversity program produced by the Anti-Defamation League, which combats anti-Semitism, by dropping the lessons. Schools had begun using the material after anti-Semitic events, including a video of a student with a swastika drawn on his body, but opponents claimed the lessons focused too heavily on race and gender and were produced by a group they considered controversial politically.",U.S./Associated Press,Jewish student reprimanded for revealing class' Nazi salute,https://news.yahoo.com/jewish-student-reprimanded-revealing-class-172021876.html
2/10/2022,"The mayor of Hudson, Ohio, presented a bizarre argument against permitting ice fishing at a local park — he said it will lead to prostitution. In a viral video clip, Craig Shubert told city council members that if the winter pastime were allowed at Hudson Springs Park, an entirely different type of pastime would naturally follow. “If you open this up to ice fishing, while on the surface it sounds good, then what happens next year? Does someone come back and say, ‘I want an ice shanty for X-amount of time?’” he asked in the clip, referring to the use of portable shelters for ice fishing. “And if you then allow ice fishing with shanties, then that leads to another problem — prostitution,” he continued. “And now you’ve got the police chief and the police department involved. Just data points to consider.” It’s not clear what “data points” Shubert, a Republican, was referencing. Shubert’s colleagues seemed to nervously laugh off his suggestion. The conversation leading up to that point was about the risk of death that comes with ice fishing, for which there are actual data points. Shubert, who serves in a largely ceremonial role in a wealthy Cleveland suburb, has already been in the news for his opinions about sex. Last year, he argued that Hudson school board members should be held accountable for “pornographic content” in schools. Among the materials he found objectionable was a book called “642 Things to Write About.” Two of the book’s prompts involved a sex scene.An investigation into Shubert’s conduct at a school board meeting revealed that those specific prompts had never even been assigned. It didn’t matter, though, once the scandal made national headlines and school board members started receiving death threats. Shubert also argued that 40 other unnamed books “of highly sexual and pornographic material were made available to children in the school,” the Akron Beacon Journal reported in November.

2/10/2022,"WASHINGTON — House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday he agreed that the Capitol riot was a violent insurrection, the clearest answer he’s given after dodging the issue this week. Asked Wednesday about Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) description of the riot as a “violent insurrection,” McCarthy said he agreed. “No one would disagree with that,” McCarthy told reporters. Plenty of Republicans disagree with the term “violent insurrection” ― several House members have even suggested that federal agents actually tricked Trump supporters into ransacking the Capitol. The Republican National Committee censured Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) on Friday for sitting on the Democrat-led panel that’s investigating the attack on the Capitol. “Representatives Cheney and Kinzinger are participating in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse,” the censure resolution said. McCarthy’s response to the RNC resolution has stood in stark contrast to that of McConnell, who unequivocally rebuked the body for what it did. The House GOP leader, on the other hand, has avoided clear statements. On Tuesday, he said “everybody knows” there was legitimate political discourse on Jan. 6, 2021, later clarifying that he meant to say “anybody who broke inside was not” engaged in legitimate political discourse. He also made excuses for the RNC, insisting it had not intended the term “legitimate political discourse” to refer to the riot — something he repeated on Wednesday, arguing that the RNC had been referring to subpoenas served on people who weren’t in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021. “Had they explained out what they were talking to this wouldn’t be controversial at all because they weren’t referring to people who had broken into this building,” McCarthy said. The resolution did not mention any subpoenas or even say that the committee had strayed from its mission to investigate the attack on the Capitol. Still, McCarthy said the resolution was fine, even though its clear meaning is different from what he says was intended. “The RNC put out their resolution,” he said. “I think they have a right to do [with] their resolution what they wanted to.” As for Cheney, McCarthy said a New York Times story about how little time she spends with Wyoming Republicans, who voted to oust her from the state party last year, gave him the impression “she shifted to focusing on maybe running for president” instead of holding her seat in Congress.  HuffPost asked Cheney if it’s true she might run for president like McCarthy mentioned.  “It won’t surprise anybody that truth is not Leader McCarthy’s strong suit,” she said.  Cheney gave McCarthy no credit for saying he agreed that the Capitol riot was a violent insurrection.  “Leader McCarthy has been among those leading the effort to prevent any investigation of the attack and try to embrace former President Trump and whitewash what happened,” Cheney said. In the immediate aftermath of the riot, McCarthy stated the obvious: Donald Trump bore responsibility for the attack. Within days, he started backtracking, saying Trump hadn’t provoked the attack, that maybe “everybody across this country” bore responsibility for what happened.  In recent weeks, as Trump has made increasingly provocative statements ― such as his pledge to consider pardons for rioters he thinks are being treated unfairly by law enforcement ― McCarthy has been relatively quiet, eschewing his weekly press conferences and trying to avoid reporters. Republicans expect to win the House in the upcoming midterm elections, and if McCarthy wants to become speaker, he needs the support of a majority of the House GOP conference, which is still loyal to Trump. So McCarthy wants to avoid provoking the former president. Trump is certainly paying close attention to what lawmakers say, putting out a statement Wednesday in response to McConnell’s remark that the riot had been part of a violent insurrection meant to stop the transfer of power. “Mitch McConnell does not speak for the Republican Party, and does not represent the views of the vast majority of its voters,” Trump said. “He did nothing to fight for his constituents and stop the most fraudulent election in American history.”  This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.
