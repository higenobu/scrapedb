3/17/2022,"Remember “Labour isn’t working”? It was the election poster that summed up the tail end of the 1970s and helped to sweep Margaret Thatcher into power. It showed a long dole queue snaking out of an unemployment office, it turned Labour politicians puce (“selling politics like soap powder,” harrumphed the then chancellor Denis Healey) and it made the front pages. There was always less to that photo than met the eye – literally. The supposedly ordinary folk pictured were, in fact, members of the Hendon Young Conservatives group in north London, only 20 of whom had bothered to turn up. They had to be photographed again and again to fill out the space. The jobs market has long shaped our politics, but were that poster to be updated to reflect today’s reality, it would sport a different title. We might call it “Work isn’t working”. Because after four decades of politicians of both main parties promising to “make work pay”, the truth is that it doesn’t – not as much as it once did. A new report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) shows that workers born in the 1980s and on the median wage earn no more than those born in the 1960s did at their age. Put bluntly, Thatcher’s children have been diddled. Today’s thirty- and fortysomethings were taught that work was how to get ahead, but they are no better off than their parents. In fact, when you factor in exorbitant house prices, they are far poorer. You could ask for few clearer signs of an economy that has failed its people, and a political class that has let down its voters. Much of the blame can be laid at Thatcher’s door. It was her government that broke the trade union movement and drafted the legislation which today makes it so hard for workers to organise and mobilise. It also followed scorched-earth economics that devastated the manufacturing industry, a sector that generally paid far better than the services that have replaced it. The Conservatives of the 1980s encouraged Britons to turn into entrepreneurs, and their exhortations have paid off: the UK now has among the highest levels of self-employment in the rich world. But as the IFS report shows, self-employment is increasingly a byword for poverty pay. Meanwhile, at the other end of the scale, chief executives are paid many multiples of what their employees earn and companies are vastly more profitable – profits that get pocketed by shareholders. Figures out this week show that British employees are entering their third squeeze on real wages in just over a decade, while more workers have dropped out of the post-pandemic labour force. Employers are crying out for staff to drive HGVs, provide care to sick and elderly people, to stack shelves in supermarkets – but economists talk of a “missing million” workers who have either retired early, emigrated or simply stopped looking for a job. You don’t need to study the statistics to realise that work no longer pays – you might simply look at your payslip. Getting into this mess took decades; getting out of it will not happen overnight. What is unlikely to work is Rishi Sunak’s plan to make social security even meaner – that will just impoverish many already poor households. Better is Labour’s plan to lift some of the restrictions on union organising and collective bargaining. But this needs to be combined with a serious strategy to encourage the growth of good jobs and less exploitative work. The side that can establish its credentials as the party of employment will have – as Thatcher’s example teaches – a crack at winning power.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the jobs market: work isn’t working | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-jobs-market-work-isnt-working
3/17/2022,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 44, was born and raised in Tehran and studied English literature at the capital’s university before becoming an English teacher. After a devastating earthquake in Iran in 2003, she went to work as a translator in the relief effort for the Japanese International Cooperation Agency. She then went to work for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies before moving to the World Health Organization as a communications officer. Zaghari-Ratcliffe came to the UK in 2007 after securing a scholarship at London Metropolitan University to study for a masters in communication management. It was a month after her arrival in the UK that she met her future husband, Richard Ratcliffe, through mutual friends. Describing their first date, Ratcliffe, an accountant, said they “clicked” and he felt as if he had “come home”. The couple were married in August 2009 in Winchester and their daughter, Gabriella, was born in June 2014, something Mr Ratcliffe said changed both their outlooks on life. “It was very important for Nazanin to keep going back to Iran to show her daughter to her parents … Before she would always go once a year, but she tried to go twice after,” he said. Zaghari-Ratcliffe began working at Thomson Reuters Foundation in 2011 as a project coordinator before taking on the role of a project manager. Ratcliffe described his wife as very house-proud, meticulous and tidy, and said she has a “pretty keen sense of justice” and is “outraged” by what has happened to her and her daughter. On 17 March 2016, Zaghari-Ratcliffe travelled to Iran to visit family for Iranian New Year with Gabriella, then nearly two years old. On 3 April 2016, members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard arrested her at Imam Khomeini Airport as she and her daughter were about to board a flight back to the UK. Until her release on 16 March 2022, she was held in Iran and accused of plotting to overthrow the country’s government, which she denied. She is returning to the UK. Anoosheh Ashoori, 67, is a British-Iranian businessman. He spent 10 years in the UK from 1972, while he studied mechanical and aeronautical engineering, before returning to Iran to take care of his ailing father. He returned to the UK in 2005 to expand his business abroad. Iranian authorities arrested him in August 2017, when he visited his mother. In August 2019, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison – 10 years for allegedly “spying for Israel’s Mossad” and two years for “acquiring illegitimate wealth”. Ashoori denied both charges. According to Amnesty International UK, Ashoori was “subjected to torture, repeatedly interrogated without a lawyer present, and forced to sign ‘confessions’ while sleep-deprived”. It described the prison conditions he was in as “overcrowded and unhygienic”. In January 2020, Ashoori’s wife, Sherry Izadi, who lives in London, said she feared he had no “hope in hell” of being released. She also said her husband had attempted suicide twice and went on a 17-day hunger strike in protest against his detention. In a piece for the Guardian, Ashoori described his experience in prison. He wrote: “Every day, I face a choice: make or break. I tried to kill myself once, when in the torture house called 209. When you hit absolute rock bottom, the only way back up is to rise again and be reincarnated. I have to stop the feeling of pure rage or of self-pity. Break isn’t a choice; only survival. I am not the same person who stepped into prison.” He was released on 16 March and is returning to the UK. Responding to his release, Ashoori’s family said: “This day has been a long time coming, and we are thankful for the efforts of everyone involved in bringing Anoosheh home. 1,672 days ago our family’s foundations were rocked when our father and husband was unjustly detained and taken away from us. “Now we can look forward to rebuilding those same foundations with our cornerstone back in place.” Morad Tahbaz, who was born in Hammersmith, London, is a tri-national (Iranian-American-British) businessman and conservationist. He graduated from Colgate University in Hamilton, in the state of New York, in 1977 with a degree in liberal arts and from Columbia University in 1983 with an MBA. Tahbaz was a co-founder of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation (PWHF) and in January 2018, Iranian authorities arrested him along with eight other PWHF-linked individuals. The group were accused of espionage after tracking endangered species with cameras. They had been researching endangered animals such as the Asiatic cheetah and the Persian leopard. Iranian authorities said the conservationists has been using the scientific and environmental projects as a cover for collecting classified information and in November 2019, the Iranian judiciary sentenced Tahbaz to 10 years in prison for “contacts with the US enemy government”. UN human rights experts said it was “hard to fathom how working to preserve the Iranian flora and fauna can possibly be linked to conducting espionage against Iranian interests”, while a government committee concluded that there was no evidence to suggest they were spies. Tahbaz was held in the notorious Evin prison. Amnesty have described him as a “prisoner of conscience” and said there was evidence that Tahbaz was among those subjected to “torture and other ill-treatment”, including prolonged solitary confinement. US officials had also been calling for Tahbaz’s release with the US special envoy for Iran, Robert Malley, describing him as a “father, an environmentalist and a cancer victim”. On 16 March 2022, he was released on furlough and remains in Iran. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said Tahbaz had been unable to return to the UK due to complications arising from his US citizenship.",News/News,"Who are Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Anoosheh Ashoori and Morad Tahbaz?",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/16/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-anoosheh-ashoori-morad-tahbaz
3/17/2022,"The family of Molly Russell, the 14-year-old who killed herself in 2017 after viewing harmful content online, have expressed frustration at the time taken by Meta to disclose data relevant to her death, a coroner has heard. Oliver Sanders QC, representing Molly’s family, told a pre-inquest review: “If I could just put on record the immense frustration and disappointment of the family at the fact that we’re conducting this process now when it could and should have been conducted two years ago.” He said Molly’s father, Ian, needed a chance to review all the Instagram posts Molly interacted with before he could submit a witness statement to the inquest. Molly, from Harrow, north-west London, viewed an extensive volume of material, including some linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide, in the months before she died in November 2017. Her inquest will look at how algorithms used by social media firms to keep people hooked may have contributed to her death. Elizabeth Lagone, the head of health and wellbeing policy at Meta, is likely to be called to give evidence by video link from the US, the hearing was told. Sanders said the family also wanted to review 29 internal Meta documents “setting out research into the impact of self-harm and suicide of material online on teenagers”. He added: “There’s a considerable volume of material that we haven’t yet seen that we need to be able to review and process and follow up before the hearing can go ahead. And before Mr Russell can finalise his witness statement, because he wants to be able to reflect on the full disclosure and what he’s learned and give his evidence about that on behalf of the family.” The review, held at Barnet coroner’s court in front of the senior coroner, Andrew Walker, heard that Meta had uncovered 12,576 pieces of Instagram content that Molly interacted with in the six months before her death in November 2017. Sanders told the coroner: “This is unfamiliar territory, I’d imagine, for all of the advocates and for you, sir, too.” Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC, representing Meta, told the review that the content had yet to be redacted to protect the privacy of users, including many children. She said Meta would need another month to do this and to produce the content in the chronological order in which Molly viewed it. Walker agreed to delay the start of the inquest until a provisional date of 19 September so that full social media data and the internal Meta research could be disclosed and reviewed. Gallagher rejected the family’s criticism of the time involved. She said: “The family’s criticism is not accepted by Meta … It would be quite wrong to suggest that this data should have been provided before and that Meta failed to do so. It was only in December of 2021, three months ago, that Meta was made an interested person. And since that time Meta has engaged at great speed. “There are multiple people engaged in ensuring we can provide content to you as quickly as possible and in as accessible away as possible. Of the 12,576 pieces of content, 1,580 pieces of those are content previously inaccessible, as they were behind private accounts.” Gallagher said the company had to balance the privacy concerns of its users. She added: “The data provided to you is extremely extensive in volume and goes far beyond what would ordinarily provided even in the law enforcement context.” She pointed out that when printed out, the data was likely to run to 36,000 pages. Gallagher suggested providing data covering a shorter period than the six months before Molly’s death. She said: “We have very much in mind concerns about proportionality and other matters and we wanted to raise with you the possibilities of providing you with a pdf for shorter periods.” This request was rejected by Sanders, who noted that another social media company, Pinterest, had already supplied data from its site that Molly was known to have viewed. He said: “We do want to see at least the six-month period in the order Molly interacted with it. The data that we have from Pinterest is covering the six-month period. It would make sense to see that material, notwithstanding the large volume.” In the UK and Ireland, the youth suicide charity Papyrus can be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or by email at pat@papyrus-uk.org, and Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 by email at jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

3/17/2022,"Manchester United are in a serious pickle: knocked out of the Champions League on Tuesday the club’s trophy drought will stretch to at least five seasons as Ralf Rangnick’s team fight to finish in the top four. The squad are patently not good enough. A perfect scenario would allow a double-figures clear-out of players but this is impossible. So, the category included below of “stay by default” recognises this; “must go” is self-explanatory; and “must stay” takes in the dead certs and those out of contract next year who should be persuaded to re-sign. Mason Greenwood, suspended indefinitely, has not been included in this list. Eric Bailly (contract expires 2024, defender) The 27-year-old should be enjoying his peak years yet through no fault of his own is too injury-prone, illustrated by his making only seven appearances this season. Edinson Cavani (2022, forward) A victim of United’s mixed messages: Ole Gunnar Solskjær projected as a coup having the striker renew terms but the Norwegian proceeded to sign Ronaldo and Cavani was relegated to the stand-in No 9. Is often not match-fit by self-declaration. Phil Jones (2023, defender) Now 30, Jones is another whose body has, sadly, serially let him down: the player Sir Alex Ferguson once claimed could be United’s greatest ever last pulled on a United shirt more than 10 times in a season in 2018-19. Jesse Lingard (2022, forward) Was persuaded to stay last summer, yet relations with his boyhood club have become particularly frosty (to characterise in polite terms) and he will depart. Anthony Martial (2024, forward) A spluttering, underwhelming seven-year United career will surely end after a half-season loan at Sevilla. Juan Mata (2022, midfielder) Has become United’s eternal substitute – the Spaniard was once the club record signing but is 34 next month. Nemanja Matic (2023, midfielder) The 33-year-old is a two-time Premier League champion with Chelsea but age has reduced him to a plodding presence whose lack of dynamism sums up one of the many faultlines in the United XI. Paul Pogba (2022, midfielder) The Frenchman is bright in bursts but has never returned a single season of consistent, game-wresting brilliance. It is time to say a polite goodbye to the World Cup winner. Harry Maguire (2025, defender) Too slow and error-prone to be a regular and thus should not be the captain. However Maguire is both. As with Victor Lindelöf (who is the marginally better player) he requires the metaphorical kick up the posterior the recruitment of an elite centre-back could give. Marcus Rashford (2023, forward) In his seventh career season he has become lost and lacklustre. But given United’s forward options he may remain for next term – unless Rashford pushes for the move he is seriously contemplating. Cristiano Ronaldo (2023, forward) At 37 he should not be United’s focal point. But which other club would take on his circa £490,00-a-week wage? Offloading Ronaldo would be a headline statement but unless the player wishes to leave it seems unlikely he will. Aaron Wan-Bissaka (2024, defender) Is pacy and loves to tackle but too often anonymous. Priorities in other positions mean he likely stays as back-up. Diogo Dalot (2023, defender) Has been edging Wan-Bissaka for the right-back berth. Is better than the latter going forward though not as accomplished defensively. David de Gea (2023, goalkeeper) “I love the club,” he said after Tuesday’s exit but De Gea is out of contract in June 2023 and though his inability to command airspace is a glaring vulnerability United should move to re-sign the 31-year-old. Anthony Elanga (2026, forward) The 19-year-old has three goals in 18 appearances in a bright start. A suspicion harboured is that he may prove underwhelming but deserves a chance to show otherwise. Fred (2023, midfielder) Has gone from maligned to quasi-magnificent – on occasion – the Brazilian benefiting from being allowed a more dynamic role. Tom Heaton (2023, goalkeeper) Solid third choice. Dean Henderson (2025, goalkeeper) Has become the No 2 goalkeeper after a brief run as first choice last term. Henderson’s ambition means he wants to leave but United should retain him for the same reason: De Gea, as with all players, requires competition. Bruno Fernandes (2025, midfielder) Has a vigorous case for being the club’s best footballer. The Portuguese may be below the level previously set but is still the second-top scorer with nine goals and the talisman. Victor Lindelöf (2024, defender) Flashes of class when stepping up to ignite goal-yielding attacks suggest the Swede, at 27, is beginning to sparkle. Lindelöf’s terms end in two years: these should be renewed and if an elite centre-back is recruited the challenge of jousting with him and Raphaël Varane for a place should further elevate his game. Scott McTominay (2025, midfielder) Shines in a mediocre side but not enough: a hunch says with better players around him McTominay will prove a genuine A-list performer. Jadon Sancho (2026, forward) The 21-year-old could end as United’s player of the year after a mid-season resurgence. Sancho currently flows through contests offering luminous moments and, vitally, end product. Luke Shaw (2023, defender) A post-Euro 2020 hangover (maybe), injury and Covid-19 could be factors in the defender’s under-par campaign. At his best Shaw is a potent attacking force and impressive part of the rearguard. Alex Telles (2024, defender) The Brazilian is a capable deputy to Shaw and his dead-ball contributions are an asset. Donny van de Beek (2025, midfielder) On loan at Everton, the word from United’s training ground is that the Dutchman is worth the opportunity to glitter that he is yet to be given. Raphaël Varane (2025, defender) Initially off the pace after joining in the summer but Varane’s smooth defending casts him as the class act of a shaky rearguard. Brandon Williams (2024, defender) On loan at Norwich but has the aggression and thrust missing from the team: his local-lad status will also enhance the dressing room.",Sport/Football,Manchester United: who must go and who should stay this summer?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/manchester-united-who-must-go-and-who-should-stay-this-summer
3/17/2022,"Iran’s release of the British-Iranian nationals Anoosheh Ashoori and Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been greeted with joy by their families, with Richard Ratcliffe saying: “Homecoming is a journey, not an arrival.” Ratcliffe, who has been at the forefront of campaigning for his wife’s release since she was imprisoned in Tehran after going there to visit family, told broadcasters that there would have to be a recovery process, adding: “You can’t get back the time that’s gone.” Speaking alongside the couple’s seven-year-old daughter, Gabriella, he added: “I don’t think it will just be today, there will be a whole process, and hopefully we’ll look back in years to come and just be a normal family and this will be a chapter in our lives, but there are many more chapters to come.” He also expressed thanks for the help given by UK government and Foreign Office officials, along with “ministers at different points” and MPs during the campaign to bring his wife back to Britain. He added: “It has been a tough journey for all of us for lots of different reasons and I’m really grateful for the grace, patience and stoicism that they have shown to get Nazanin home.” He and Gabriella had already chosen the toys that she was going to bring to meet her mother when the plane carrying her back from Iran landed in Britain. Ashoori’s family, meanwhile, said they were “delighted” he had been released from Iran and was returning to the UK. The 68-year-old, a retired civil engineer, was arrested in August 2017 while visiting his elderly mother in Tehran, and was detained in Evin prison. He was returning to Britain along with Zaghari-Ratcliffe after the UK government settled a £400m debt owed to Iran. A statement from Ashoori’s family said: “We are delighted to confirm that Anoosheh has been released and will be returning to the UK today after five long years. “This day has been a long time coming, and we are thankful for the efforts of everyone involved in bringing Anoosheh home.” They added that it had been 1,672 days since the “family’s foundations were rocked” when he was detained and taken away from them. “Now, we can look forward to rebuilding those same foundations with our cornerstone back in place,” the statement added. Despite living in the UK for 20 years, the father and husband was later convicted of spying for Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency and sentenced to prison for 10 years. Both Ashoori and Zaghari-Ratcliffe have always protested their innocence. However, there was a very different reaction from the family of a third dual national, Morad Tahbaz, a British-American businessman born in Hammersmith, London, who also has Iranian citizenship. He has been released from prison on furlough. His sister, Taraneh, told the World at One on BBC Radio 4 that the family were “absolutely and utterly devastated” that the only British-born hostage in Tehran was “being left behind”. She added: “As far as a hostage goes he has been there under trumped-up charges and he was, as Nazanin was, visiting his family. He is an environmentalist, a conservationist who was taken hostage.” She said that her brother was very unwell. The family had had to rely on the media for updates about his situation, she said. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said on Twitter that Tahbaz had been released from prison “on furlough” and that the UK government would continue to work to secure his departure from Iran.",News/News,‘A long time coming’: Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori’s families joyful at release,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/16/a-long-time-coming-zaghari-ratcliffe-and-ashooris-families-joyful-at-release
3/17/2022,"When the sculptor Grenville Davey won the Turner prize in 1992 the Guardian described him as the “rank outsider”. The Wall Street Journal was even blunter in its headline: “Brit Art-Prize Fiasco: Grenville Who?” The media bewilderment was in part because Davey, who has died suddenly aged 60, beat the favourite, Damien Hirst, to the award. Nor did Davey make particularly good tabloid column inches. When Hirst eventually won two years later he claimed he spent the prize money in one night behind the bar at the Groucho Club in Soho; Davey told reporters his plan was a “couple of days off” and beyond being grateful for the cash prize, “what I have to say is probably not worth anything. I think there will be turkey on the table this Christmas.” His work proved less flashy too. While he was part of the same generation of YBAs (young British artists) who attended Goldsmiths’ College (now Goldsmiths, University of London) in the late 1980s, Davey’s work possessed a beguiling austerity at odds with the more flamboyant sensationalism of his peers. On news of Davey’s death, Hirst, a friend, acknowledged the debt he held to the artist. “Without Grenville Davey there would have been no YBAs. Grenville was the first artist to truly inspire my generation … his cool surreal circles directly led to me making my spot paintings.” At the Turner prize exhibition at Tate Britain, the artist exhibited Hal, two steel columns, each just under 2.5 metres in height. Like much of Davey’s work, Hal triggered associations with mundane, everyday objects – either oversized drinks cans or undersized industrial chimneys – but with details removed or altered. Davey had been nominated for the prize in part for an exhibition a year earlier at the Lisson gallery in London, where his work fitted with the gallery’s interest in the minimalism of a previous generation of British artists, such as Richard Long and John Latham, as well as Americans such as Carl Andre and Donald Judd. The younger artist took their pared-down aesthetic and interest in repetition and infused it with a slightly more “pop” edge. Untitled Pair (1987) features what might be two domestic satellite dishes, painted immaculately with a turquoise sheen, hung at different heights. The enigmatic painted steel and rubber Grey Seal (1987) resembles a big porthole cover. While Davey continued to exhibit regularly, as well as immersing himself in public and architectural commissions, the press would not leave alone the idea of his supposed obscurity. In 2011 one critic asked: “Where is Grenville Davey now? Come to that, who is Grenville Davey?” Davey himself was sanguine, refusing to play the fame game required of artists in the 90s. “Things got really noisy – I just had to get away. There was interest in the press, people recognised me in the street, in the pub. It was good to get away,” he said, swapping his Brixton studio in a condemned former fish and chip shop for a farm in rural Essex. From there he took on more collaborative commissions. These included a permanent public artwork for the Olympic Park in east London, commissioned in 2011. Inter Alia consists of 61 trapezoid brass markers that jut from a wall, each identical but with a series of rings on the facing surface, likened by Davey to fingerprints. They were, he said, “reminiscent of the finger in the icing, on an industrial scale”. While accessible, the sculptures were developed through a highly theoretical framework. In 2010 Davey had undertaken a six-month residency at the Centre for Research in String Theory at Queen Mary, University of London, working with the physicist David Berman to draw out parallels between the theoretical geometries within string theory and Davey’s own longstanding interest in symmetry. Continuing the project as an artist-in-residence at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Cambridge, Davey exhibited a series of maquette works at Chelsea Space in London in 2014 that referenced the concepts of T-duality and mirror symmetry. Grenville was born in Launceston, Cornwall, to Lillian, a nurse, and Clifford Davey, who was in the Royal Navy Engineers and later became a police officer. After attending Launceston college, Davey did a foundation fine art course at Exeter College of Art and Design, then a fine art degree at Goldsmiths’. In the final year of art school, before graduating in 1985, he discovered the workshop with its metalworking equipment. “I was shy of it at first but got over it,” Davey recalled. “That’s where things started to take off.” After being included in a group exhibition at the Showroom gallery a year later, in 1987 he had his first solo show at the Lisson. In 1988 he was included in the Venice Biennale and a year later Charles Saatchi bought works, which, given the collector’s outsized influence at the time as tastemaker, placed Davey on a trajectory to success. Institutional shows followed at the Stichting De Appel Foundation in Amsterdam (1990), the Kunsthalle, Berne (1991) and, after his Turner win, the Chisenhale gallery in London (1992). In 1996 Davey undertook the first of many public commissions, working with landscape architects to develop public seating at Newcastle Drawdock, a neglected boat landing on the River Thames in east London. Two years later a pair of site-specific sculptures for the offices of the Dr Martens shoe factory in Northamptonshire was unveiled. His interest in the public realm continued into the new millennium, and he collaborated on civic redesigns in Manchester city centre, Barnsley, Stockton and Middlesbrough. In 1998 he began teaching at the University of the Arts, London, and in 1999 at the University of East London, where he remained until his death, becoming head of the MA fine art course in 2009. He is survived by his son, Sennen, from his marriage to Victoria (nee Burton), a sculptor, which ended in divorce in 2015, a stepson, Charles, and three brothers, Graham, Chris and Adrian.

3/17/2022,"Your article (Teachers ‘buckling under strain’ of pupils’ mental health crisis, 11 March) highlights the serious impact that the pandemic is having on the mental wellbeing of children and school staff. We’ve long campaigned for government-funded counselling support in every secondary school, academy and further education college in England, provided by qualified staff. The need has never been more acute than now to support young people and alleviate the growing strain on school staff. Schools can’t do this alone. We’re seeing an increase in demand for services as young people struggle to come to terms with how their lives have been transformed by the pandemic – and that demand is only going to rise. We know that counselling can have a transformative effect on young people’s lives and that early, accessible help is key. Indeed, research indicates that school counselling alleviates psychological distress and improves self-esteem. This is crucial to help with the range of emotional challenges that children and young people are facing. There is a trained counselling and psychotherapy workforce that can meet the demand if funding was secured for universal access in all schools and colleges. We need to act now to prevent overwhelming pressure on mental health services in years to come.Dr Hadyn WilliamsChief executive, British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy  Your article about the unwise spending of £5bn on Covid tutoring (National tutoring scheme failing disadvantaged pupils, say MPs, 10 March) is cause for great anger and concern, but not surprise. The Department for Education’s strategy of appointing a large service provider to design and administer the scheme was wrong, since it would inevitably involve costly layers of administration for schools to access funding and deliver tuition. Instead, funding should have gone directly to schools based on the numbers of disadvantaged children and those with special educational needs. Schools are not only in the best position to identify pupils who need tuition the most, but also to provide tutors via their own networks. Schools could employ recently retired teachers, offer extra hours to part-time staff or call on supply staff. There are already systems in place for financial accountability in schools, so they would be able to provide evidence that extra funding was being spent on pupils in need. Given the scathing report from the education select committee, the current strategy should be ditched in favour of direct funding to schools. The government needs to respect the professionalism, dedication and judgment of teachers, and change its strategy on tutoring.Pauline ChaterMorchard Bishop, Devon  Many years ago, in my job as a teacher educator, I came across an inner-city primary school in Liverpool where each day started with an art class. When I asked the headteacher why he did this, he replied: “Because it is calming and civilising.” The school performed well in the league tables. The government’s emphasis on catching up on reading, writing and arithmetic in primary schools does not make for a cohesive curriculum. It also appears that referred pupils with particular needs often get help where art is used as a therapy.

3/17/2022,"Greater equality than that experienced in other Mesoamerican cities may have been key to the successes of an ancient Zapotec community in Mexico which survived far longer than any contemporaneous metropolis, a new study suggests. The ruins of Monte Albán – which include pyramids, canals and a ballgame court – sit on a semi-arid hilltop above the city of Oaxaca. At its peak the city, founded in 500BC, was the administrative and religious capital for the Zapotec people, and home to 17,000 people, despite a lack of water supplies or fertile land. The peer-reviewed paper, published in Frontiers in Political Science, suggests that less extreme divides in wealth and power could help explain the city’s rapid population growth, as people sought both security and a higher standard of living. It indicates that collective processes directed from below may have significantly contributed to the 1,300-year period of relative prosperity. Globally, it is rare for a single settlement from that era to have endured so long, the authors add. “There is very little indication of highly autocratic or concentrated power, nor stark inequalities of wealth,” Gary Feinman, study co-author and the MacArthur curator of anthropology at the Field Museum in Chicago, told the Guardian. “Plus, there are many indications of cooperation between households.” Leaders of that period generally were not glorified. Just one depiction of a seemingly important individual has been discovered from the first 400 years of the city: a stone carving of an individual wearing a rain god mask while appearing to lead a ritual. The site’s architecture, meanwhile, suggests the existence of a far more collectivist society than elsewhere during the same period. Although there are obvious signs of social stratification, most homes were made with adobe bricks and stone which were used exclusively for high status houses elsewhere. Residents, who shared terraces and retaining walls, were also economically interdependent upon each other, exchanging crafts and food. “There are no rich tombs, no great caches of household riches or other evidence of extreme wealth differences and no large, ornate palace that is clearly the ruler’s residence,” the study reports. “From early in the site’s history, the city’s core was centered on a large plaza that could have accommodated a significant proportion of the site’s population.” Previous research has also suggested that compared with other cities in the area, the skeletons of poorer people in Monte Albán were less likely to show signs of malnutrition than their counterparts nearby. Differences in nourishment between men and women also appeared far less pronounced than elsewhere. The new study reports “no indication of central-governmental food storage” but instead a market system. The rulers may not have been as autocratic as elsewhere, but there was a hereditary aristocracy. Some lived closer to the top of the hill than others, and certain homes were more attractive and larger than others. There were more elaborate funerals and burial offerings for elites. From AD800 the city’s populace began to depart as inequality grew, though there is no consensus on the reasons behind the eventual abandonment. Tour guides at the Unesco world heritage site often attribute the decline to drought. But research suggests its inhabitants may have left for emergent independent city-states amid elite infighting and growing class divisions, with the wider populace excluded from public ceremonies and rituals. Feinman, who authored the paper along with adjunct Field Museum curator Linda Nicholas, adds that art individualising leaders generally emerged around the period of the city’s slump. “Monte Albán was a city where a new unwritten social contract was implemented at its foundation,” he said. “And with its collective and relatively equitable government, it endured for more than a millennium. Yet when it collapsed, the city’s population declined drastically and many of its institutions dissolved, ushering in a period of more autocratic rule.”",News/World news,Monte Albán: the ancient city that thrived due to greater equality,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/monte-alban-mexico-zapotec-community-oaxaca
3/17/2022,"Your editorial (14 March) helpfully argues that it is time the government recognised the public harm that gambling does. It refers to the recent appeal from senior doctors that there should be a statutory levy on the gambling industry to pay for treatment for gambling dependency. From 2004-06, I ran the Responsibility in Gambling Trust, the body then responsible for raising “voluntary” funds from the industry to pay for research, education and treatment. It was evident then that voluntary funding was inadequate, and I costed full national treatment needs and campaigned internally with the industry and the government to impose a statutory levy to pay for it. Sixteen years on, it has still not happened. However, I now believe it is utterly misguided. Benson & Hedges doesn’t fund smoking addiction care nor does Carling fund alcohol dependency treatment. It is time the state recognised that gambling addiction is on a par with those problems and should be funded by the public purse, with proper taxation on the gambling industry to support it. The lobbying of the gambling industry on MPs and ministers means that the levy route is doomed to failure, as well as being a cop-out on the government’s responsibility.Robin BurgessNorthampton  GambleAware works closely with the Department of Health and Social Care and commissions the National Gambling Treatment Service, bringing together a range of providers, which is well integrated with the NHS. Furthermore, all our work is led by research and is independently evaluated. GambleAware is also a strong supporter of a mandatory levy, is accountable to the Charity Commission and has robust systems of governance in place, ensuring that the gambling industry has absolutely no influence over any of our activity. Gambling requires a public health approach which includes addressing social vulnerability, prevention and treatment. We are proud of our contribution to the national strategy to reduce gambling harms and continue to support more than 40,000 people each year via the National Gambling Treatment Service.Zoë OsmondChief executive, GambleAware  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
