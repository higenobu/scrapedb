1/23/2022,"It must have felt a little peculiar at full-time for Manchester City, as they left the pitch for the first time without the full complement of points in a Premier League game for the first time since October. They may have failed to extend their winning run to 13 matches but they avoided defeat after Aymeric Laporte headed in a second-half equaliser to open up a 12-point advantage over second-placed Liverpool.  Southampton faded and survived two late VAR calls, the first for a possible penalty when Kevin De Bruyne bobbed towards the box and the second for a red card on Stuart Armstrong. Both seemed sensible calls and the Saints deserved to take something from a lively encounter for their endeavour. Pep Guardiola is viewed as a magician by so many but here it was almost a case of forecasting the future. Before kick-off he stuck to a familiar script, insisting his team are not invincible and that they would drop points, and reiterating that the most important thing for him is how City react when they do find themselves in a spot of bother. Rather inevitably, then, with seven minutes gone, just as City were stamping their authority on the game, they trailed to a game Southampton side that seemed intent on being the ones to halt a winning streak that had seen City win their previous 12 matches by an aggregate score of 34-7. It was a fine goal, too. Kyle Walker-Peters motored forward from right-back and played a neat one-two with Nathan Redmond, controlling the return pass with his left foot before, with his next touch, stroking the ball into the far corner with the outside of his right boot. The galling thing for Guardiola, who at one point found comfort squatting on the edge of his technical area in a black puffer coat and brogues, was that City passed up an opportunity seconds earlier. City succinctly shifted the ball from left to right but Raheem Sterling undercooked the key pass after spying Kyle Walker on the overlap. Sterling was guilty of missing a decent opening too, blasting over after cutting inside Che Adams but Southampton had the goalkeeper Fraser Forster to thank for preventing City from levelling. Phil Foden sent in a teasing cross from the left flank, which Romain Perraud failed to clear and just as it seemed Sterling would tap-in – the Southampton supporters in the Chapel Stand behind the goal sighed in unison as the ball found its way towards the back post – a sprawling Forster saved with his legs. Guardiola could afford a wry smile as he headed down the tunnel at the interval and the scoreline would have been worse had Armando Broja been onside when the commanding Oriol Romeu, who was given his Barcelona debut by Guardiola, played the striker in on goal with a wondrous through ball on 23 minutes. Broja crept behind Walker but had strayed a shade offside. The home support were on their feet again five minutes later in anticipation of a penalty when the referee, Simon Hooper, put his whistle to his mouth after Ederson brushed with Broja as the striker surged on to Adams’s pass in the box, only to award City a free-kick for an offside. Southampton had no desire to sit on their lead and within a couple of minutes of the restart Ederson pushed a Jan Bednarek header from a James Ward-Prowse corner to safety. City were zipping the ball around, with Jack Grealish, operating down the middle as a false nine, drawing the odd foul but the hosts, not for the first time, came closest to doubling their advantage before City began to dissect their opponent. Another Ward-Prowse corner caused havoc in the City box and Broja nodded against a post from a yard out. Guardiola had seen enough and called for Gabriel Jesus, who replaced Sterling. Rodri earlier curled a shot on the roof of the Southampton goal and Foden saw a volleyed effort repelled by Forster as City tried to ratchet through the gears. Then came the equaliser that swung momentum in City’s favour. De Bruyne flighted a free-kick towards the back post, where there was a scattering of dark blue shirts and Laporte powered in a header. Guardiola clenched both fists and embraced his assistant, Juanma Lillo. From there, City refused to give Southampton their ball back and the visitors piled forward in search of a winner. De Bruyne could only bite his lip in frustration after curling a shot against the woodwork and Guardiola had his hands on his head when Jesus headed against a post with the goal gaping. City would not go quietly but Southampton held on through six minutes of second-half stoppage time.",Sport/Football,Aymeric Laporte spares Manchester City’s blushes at battling Southampton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/22/southampton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report
1/23/2022,"Ralf Rangnick hailed the dressing room atmosphere after Marcus Rashford’s winner 27 seconds from the end meant Manchester United overtook West Ham to claim fourth place. It was the interim manager’s first back-to-back wins in the 10th game of his tenure and given the reported unrest surrounding the club due to unconvincing form and inconsistent results Rangnick was content.  “The atmosphere [in the dressing room] is amazing,” he said. “Quite rightly, the boys were celebrating. They know what a massive win this was. This was an extremely emotional game and an extremely emotional moment. “If you score in the last seconds of the game and there is no time for the other team to reply: knowing this was extremely emotional. “Thank you to the [fans] – the way they supported the team all through the game, they pushed us and carried us. It was amazing. Since I arrived, it was by far the best atmosphere in the stadium.” Given how late the winner came, Rangnick was asked if there might now be “Ralfy Time” as there was once “Fergie Time”. “I don’t know how long Fergie Time was. Was that the last five minutes? I wouldn’t mind if that happened,” he said. “But we would also like to have more games like Brentford when we were 3-0 up [United won 3-1]. But if you score in the last seconds the big advantage is there is no time for the team to reply.” The winning goal was Rashford’s second in consecutive games and Rangnick said: “He’s one of the top strikers in England – we know the qualities he has. He has almost everything a modern striker needs: pace, skill, the size and physicality. “In the end it’s all about confidence for strikers and I’m pretty sure those two goals will have raised the level of confidence with Marcus and now it’s about taking steps, it’s about continuity. I think he can play a very important role for the rest of the season for us.” Rashford said: “It is an important goal and [to score so] late on is an amazing feeling. We have to use that winning feeling.” United’s next game is at home to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup on 4 February. “We have high ambitions in the Cup,” said Rangnick. “We know in all of these games we have to perform on a high level.” David Moyes was unhappy at how his team conceded. “I’m pissed off with that result for sure,” West Ham’s manager said. “We completely switched off.”",Sport/Football,Rangnick hails Rashford following ‘emotional’ winner against West Ham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/22/rangnick-hails-rashford-following-emotional-winner-against-west-ham
1/23/2022,"Tennis Australia appears to have dumped Santos one year into a “multiyear” partnership deal after a campaign targeting the fossil fuel company for “sportswashing”. Circumstances surrounding the termination of the agreement are unclear as neither party are commenting but the decision to part ways took place before 5 November 2021.  The deal was announced in February 2021, with Tennis Australia saying at the time that Santos had “joined the Australian Open and ATP Cup family as Official Natural Gas Partner”. “The Summer of Tennis events will provide a platform for Santos to showcase how natural gas is used in everyday life. Connecting with tennis at a grassroots level is also a priority,” it said. The company’s branding was widespread during the 2021 Australian Open, with the Santos logo appearing courtside and advertisements promoting the jobs provided by the gas industry playing during broadcasts. In another instance, a “fuelled by Santos” slogan appeared on the score count during an epic rallies video. Tennis Australia confirmed to Guardian Australia that Santos had been dropped as a partner. A spokesperson for Tennis Australia did not respond to detailed questions regarding the circumstances of the decision except to confirm that the partnership agreement had ended. “Santos was a partner of AO2021, however they are no longer a partner now,” they said. Tennis Australia is a signatory to the UN Sports For Climate Action framework, which seeks to use the “soft power” of sport to encourage meaningful action on the climate crisis. Tennis is among those sports considered to be uniquely affected by climate change. The 2014 Australian Open – where play was stopped and 1,000 spectators were treated for heat exhaustion when temperatures rose above 40C – is considered an example of how climate change affects sport. The 2021 partnership deal faced strong community backlash, with 7,600 people signing a petition addressed to the Australian Open chief executive, Craig Tiley, as part of a campaign on social media. Sports organisations have also come under internal pressures, with 300 professional athletes signing up to a campaign urging more action on climate change. The chief executive of 350 Australia, Lucy Manne, whose organisation coordinated the campaign, welcomed the end of the arrangement, saying Tennis Australia “should be congratulated for ending their association with Santos”. “It’s really important we start to see our biggest, most loved sporting events move away from partnerships like those with Santos,” Manne said. “Tennis Australia hasn’t told us why this has occurred and they may not, but regardless, this is a huge public benefit in terms of not having a big fossil fuel company’s brand splashed all over a major event. “There was a big effort to make it unacceptable for cigarette companies to sponsor events … now it’s the time to do the same for fossil fuel companies.” Santos – which is seeking to develop new gas projects in the Beetaloo Basin, Barossa, and Narrabri – still sponsors several major sporting events, including the Tour Down Under, which begins on Monday. Last year the International Energy Agency said limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop in 2021.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Manne said it was “perverse” that during the 2020 Tour Down Under sections of the route passed through areas hit by the Black Summer bushfires, while the company was promoting its business through its sponsorship. “There’s a big opportunity for sports like those overseen by Tennis Australia and the Tour Down Under to educate the public about what the effects of climate change look like,” Manne said. “And it’s easier to do that without fossil fuel sponsorship.”",Sport/Sport,Tennis Australia ends partnership with Santos after one year,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/23/tennis-australia-ends-partnership-with-santos-after-one-year
1/23/2022,"A lot of people predicted Ash Barty would play Naomi Osaka in the Australian Open’s last 16. Barty was not one of them. “That was your expectation,” she told press after Osaka fell to Amanda Anisimova. “My expectation was whoever it would be.” Barty’s expectation is in close alignment with her memory, and her memory is of being one set and three games down against a 17-year-old Anisimova the semi-final at Roland Garros in 2019.  “I remember the biggest moment of that match was coming out of the chair at 3-0 down the second set,” she recalled. “I remember, to this very day, what I was saying to myself at that change of ends. From then on it’s held me in pretty good stead, sticking to those values and continuing to try and grow each and every time on court, and problem-solve and work my way through.” On Sunday Barty will renew her rivalry with the American, who has not made it past the third round of a grand slam since but continues to demonstrate that she very much remains a danger to the Australian’s chances at Melbourne Park. “I try to forget, but also I remember that I learned a lot from that moment,” she said. “That was a turning point in my career, and you have to be able to take learnings from those moments, as hard as they are sometimes. I was able to navigate and find a way through. Which at that point in my life, in my career, it was a massive turning point.” Most immediately, that turning point yielded a three-set win and the French Open trophy after she overcame Markéta Vondroušová in the final to secure her first grand slam title. Since then the 25-year-old, who added last year’s Wimbledon title to her major collection, has been the untouchable world No 1 with no sign of slipping off the summit. “It feels like it’s a lifetime ago, but some of those memories are still really vivid,” she said. “Without a doubt we will take that and use that experience, use those feelings and those emotions as best we can. “I would have loved to have had the opportunity to play Naomi. I love to test myself against the very best. In the position we’re in, Amanda has played a fantastic tournament. She deserves her spot in the round of 16. I think the match we will play will be exciting. It will be good for both of us to get out there and test ourselves against each other.” The encounter has the potential to swing both ways. Anisimova, now 20, has brought an aggression to Melbourne Park that Belinda Bencic also failed to contain, and a wide, discombobulating serve. Barty, however, has won 57 consecutive service games stretching back to her first match of the year at the Adelaide International against Coco Gauff. At this tournament she is yet to be broken in 23 service games, even during a couple of tough moments against Italian third-round opponent Camila Giorgi. “It’s been really solid over the last couple of weeks,” she said. “Particularly in Adelaide I felt like I found a really good rhythm with it. Here so far in my matches I’ve been able to squeeze out of a few really tough games.” The match will open the evening session on Rod Laver Arena, despite Barty making no secret of her preference to play during the day. “I think I love to play in the daytime, that’s no secret,” she said. “I’ve always been a morning person, always been up early, and have grown up playing in the Australian sun. I love it. I love the extra bounce and the heat in the court. “But night sessions here at the Australian Open are really special. The experience and the atmosphere that’s created in a night session is absolutely brilliant. “So, I mean, everyone has preferences, but I don’t argue either way. I’m happy to play at any given time and get the opportunity to go out there and try and do what I can do, enjoy it, and take it for what it is.” Anisimova, whose good form over the past few months has coincided with the presence in her camp of Australian coach Darren Cahill, is well aware of the threat the twice-grand slam winner poses. “She’s an amazing player, I look up to her a lot,” Anisimova said. “I love her game. She’s very consistent. She’s a champion. “So it’s just going to be exciting to go up against her, another amazing opportunity for me. I’m going to get back on the practice court tomorrow and work on my game and just try to give myself the best chance.”",Sport/Sport,Ash Barty draws on French Open experience in bid to topple Amanda Anisimova ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/23/ash-barty-draws-on-french-open-experience-in-bid-to-topple-amanda-anisimova
1/23/2022,"Charlotte Leslie has been hit with threats that would have broken a lesser woman. The former Conservative MP for Bristol North West crossed a Tory donor, Mohamed Amersi. Now she has learned what journalists and whistleblowers already know: when you challenge the moneyed elite, oligarchical Britain’s legal system will throw you into “a world of pain”. “We both know you’re in a great deal of trouble,” Carl Hunter OBE, a party fixer and adviser to Tory ministers told her in February 2020. “I think you need to consider your position, as in being able to walk the dog at night, being able to sleep well at night.”  In the unlikely event she had missed his meaning, the recordings Leslie made to protect herself show Hunter telling her: “Mohamed feels somebody has written an anonymous letter. “You’re looking into a world of pain on this… If you are not careful this will keep you up at night, monopolise your life, for as long as it lasts.” Amersi denies that he was aware of what Hunter was saying or that Hunter was operating on his instructions. He met Leslie in her capacity as the director of the Conservative Middle East Council, an influential group that promotes better relationships with a region that is both strategically sensitive and, of course, awash with oil wealth. Amersi and Leslie discussed in March 2020 the possibility of Amersi becoming its chair. After Leslie and the council’s president, Nicholas Soames, decided not to work with him, Amersi set up a rival organisation. Leslie and Soames sent a private due diligence note setting out their concerns to Ben Elliot, the Tories’ co-chair, and to a handful of political and intelligence sources: this is apparently the “anonymous letter” Hunter referred to in his threatening phone calls. Although we do not know its contents, Leslie said she compiled it from publicly available sources. Amersi said its claims were “defamatory and inaccurate” and Leslie was “damaging his reputation” in the eyes of the people who mattered most to him. In a Commons debate on Thursday about the ability of the extremely wealthy to abuse the law, David Davis noticed Amersi had announced that he was “driven by a desire to create a world that’s better for everybody. Let’s test that against public domain facts, shall we?” In 2002, while Amersi was a solicitor, Mr Justice Peter Smith described Amersi’s conduct as “lamentable” and his evidence as “unreliable”, “unconvincing” and “unsatisfactory”. In 2005, Amersi made £4m helping a Luxembourg company buy a Russian telecoms business. The following year, a Swiss judge concluded the company was secretly owned by what Davis described as a “top crony” of Vladimir Putin. As the Guardian and the BBC reported, the Pandora papers showed Amersi was involved in the structure of a deal for the Swedish firm Telia that was later found to include a $220m (£162m) bribe for the daughter of the then president of Uzbekistan. (At the time, Amersi’s lawyers said he had “no reason” to believe it might be a bribe and that the underlying arrangements for the deal had been put in place before his involvement.) Despite all this information being publicly available, Davis concluded, “Amersi has used his wealth and influence to try to bully Charlotte Leslie into silence”. The taped calls from Hunter, revealed last week by Simon Walters of the Mail, are horrible to hear. Leslie is desperate to escape from the “world of pain”. At one stage, she offers to apologise if that will get Amersi off her back, but her contrition does not satisfy Amersi or his lawyers. Amersi told the Observer he condemned “any language that was threatening”. As far as he was concerned, Hunter was an honest broker trying to settle a dispute. He told the Mail that Leslie was “trying to portray herself as the victim when the reverse is true” and that MPs had “hidden behind parliamentary privilege to recycle false allegations”. Meanwhile, Hunter told the Mail “he did not recollect” suggesting it would not be safe for Leslie to go out at night. He said he was trying to help her. The Metropolitan police are examining allegations of malicious communications and harassment. No one, however, can deny the scale of the legal pressure rich men can apply in the UK. Charlotte Leslie has had scores of threatening legal letters from Amersi’s solicitors, Carter Ruck. In a pattern familiar to Carole Cadwalladr, my colleague who investigated the Leave campaign, Catherine Belton, the exposer of Putin’s cronies, and Tom Burgis of the Financial Times, who examined the power of a Kazakh mining conglomerate, Amersi is suing Leslie personally, along with her employer. First, he alleged that Leslie had breached his rights under the Data Protection Act. As David Davis said: “Usually, the information commissioner deals with such disagreements, but when a rich man wants to silence and destroy someone, they go to the courts.” Mrs Justice Tipples threw out his case, saying that Amersi and his lawyers had not “taken the trouble to follow the correct procedures”. Undeterred, Amersi is bringing another data protection case and is threatening a libel action, not only against Leslie but against colleagues on the council who have stood by her. During the Commons debate, the Conservative MP Julian Lewis told a hapless government minister that Leslie was threatened with financial ruin for checking whether someone who “wanted to take over a political organisation within the Conservative party was clean or dirty”. If the minister could not understand why Leslie and people like her needed protection, “then he needs to… restudy his brief”. The minister said the government would respond. But I don’t see how it can. The Conservative party is the beneficiary of a system Amersi himself described as “access capitalism”. He paid money to Ben Elliot whose Quintessentially “concierge” company provides the super-rich with any luxury they desire. Elliot is Prince Charles’s nephew and Amersi went on to become a trustee of the Prince’s Trust. Like hedge fund managers and Russian oligarchs, Amersi and his Russian-born partner, Nadezhda Rodicheva, have donated lavishly to the Tory party. Wealth, monarchy, government and law mix so thoroughly that the boundaries disintegrate into a foaming broth. Do not in these circumstances be surprised by the Conservative attacks on rights to vote and demonstrate and threats to destroy the BBC. Oligarchical money is of a piece with oligarchical politic and Charlotte Leslie won’t be the last person it sends into a world of pain.

1/23/2022,"After spending three decades murdering every plant I touched, I was astonished to find myself in lockdown with a functioning edible garden. Perhaps isolation taught me patience. Perhaps the pandemic made me more careful. It certainly helped that there were already veggies growing in raised garden beds when we moved in: from them I learned that part of gardening is watching plants die (some died! it was OK!), and from that I gained the confidence to plant more.  My first tip is to start simple. Basil, dill, parsley, chilli, snow peas, lemon thyme, strawberries and mint are all hardy if you have good soil (did you know you can simply go out and buy an entire bag of worms? And then just chuck them in?), enough sun and remember to water each day. I keep my herbs and small vegetables in balcony boxes that hang above the garden beds, which grow zucchini, beans and tomatoes I can take little credit for; the beds were already irrigated. My second tip is to keep it simple by way of cheap accoutrements that remove both guesswork and legwork. I have a big rubber tub ($4, Bunnings) collecting rain (free, La Niña). I have a soil meter ($17) that measures moisture, pH and light (a magical tool that tells you when to water and has kept my indoor plants alive as well). I plant seeds in a seedling box ($12) first, which keeps the weather off until they’re big enough to be moved. Once set up in their balcony boxes ($11), I scatter a smorgasbord of year-round flowers around them to lure bees that will pollinate the plants. Bees: also free! It is obscene how much joy this all brings me – and it takes around five minutes each day to tend. I run out every morning now with my dumb cute watering can ($20) to water everyone, trim off the dead leaves (it helps the plant focus on the living ones) and see if anything has happened. A new strawberry! A different flower! A bee! Look at this BEE! I yell all the developments at my bored partner and show him the tiny yield I have gathered in a tiny basket (so it looks bigger). Sometimes I wear a hat while I’m doing it, like some lady in a boring BBC show. It’s so much easier than I thought! And incredibly dull.

1/23/2022,"Metiria Turei, the former Green party co-leader, left parliament more than four years ago, resigning from the co-leadership and the party list after right wing lobby groups, with an able assist in the form of the parliamentary press gallery, led a ruthless campaign against the former lawyer for admitting that she once had to commit benefit fraud to feed her young family. The admission came in a landmark speech condemning New Zealand’s miserly welfare system. Struggling families were paid far too little to survive, something policymakers had known for decades, with examples ranging from Turei’s own to anonymous sole parents who were coming forward to describe how they spent $380 of the $480 in assistance from the State on rent alone. Turei and the Greens were promising to lift the rate of sole parent support, remove sanctions, and make other necessary and progressive reforms to the welfare system in order for people to meet their basic needs.  Four years after that speech the assertion that families are entitled to enough to meet their basic needs seems uncontroversial. This year the Labour government is lifting benefits between $32 and $55 a week, indexing future increases to wage growth, and lifting what are called abatement thresholds, so that beneficiaries can keep more of what they earn in part-time and other forms of work. In short, Turei was vindicated. Those right wing lobby groups, the press gallery, and even a number of her own Green Party colleagues who drove Turei to resign for her “dishonesty” appear now, not even half a decade later, out of step with the facts and the times. This is the kind of political and personal bravery that is unimaginable in the current Green party. Turei’s stand saw the Green’s bleed off more of Labour’s vote. Andrew Little, the then Labour leader, lost confidence in his own ability to lead Labour and a last-minute plea was made to the then Labour deputy leader Jacinda Ardern. The rest is, as the cliche goes, history. Today the Greens struggle to break the 10% ceiling Turei and her co-leader Russel Norman were so regularly breaking in the 2010s. Part of this is because, according to a good number of former members, the party’s timidity in government. The Greens provide the Labour majority with confidence and supply – meaning they’re obliged to vote for the budget and in confidence motions – and in exchange co-leaders James Shaw and Marama Davidson occupy ministerial roles outside cabinet. In one sense, it’s a sweet deal. The Labour government doesn’t need the Greens, but the party still receives something anyway. However the deal is proving toxic within the party. Under the inter-party agreement, the Greens are free to criticise Labour outside their portfolio areas. In practice this is rarely the case. Shaw and Davidson are smart enough to know that progress in their portfolios relies as much on good relationships with the minister of finance and his closest advisers as it does on simply “being right” on the issues or having the public on side. That means the Green co-leaders are, for the sake of making progress, often hostage to the whims and wishes of their far larger partner. In most cases this is probably fine. The two parties agree on more than they disagree. But in the policy area that cuts right to the Greens’ identity – climate change – it is a disaster with the minister of climate change, James Shaw, defending and enacting the government’s line. Not the Green party’s line. This means balancing regressive farming interests with progressive environmental interests. It means taking account of the vocal business community that Labour seems so often to fear as well as taking account of the “just transition” arm of the union movement. This is, of course, what a good minister does. Balances competing interests. But an effective minister does so and then takes a position that aligns with their politics. Shaw and many Green party members find this increasingly difficult as Labour, to pick one example, insists on “voluntary” inclusion of agriculture in the Emissions Trading Scheme. It becomes more farcical as Shaw, whose party’s political identity is staked on lowering emissions, meekly defends New Zealand’s increasing emissions because, well, he’s the minister of climate change. This is the price a party of government pays for the limited decision-making power it gets. As the Māori party found out between 2008 and 2017, policy is made primarily in cabinet – the decision-making body where they exercise no sway outside limited committees. The Māori party example is instructive. The party went from five seats in 2008, their first year in government, to three seats in 2011, and then two seats in 2014. Come 2017 they were gone. But at the last election, after a good deal of rebuilding networks and changing strategy, the party came roaring back with two MPs who won their seats against Labour’s incoming tide. Why? Because the party rejected the idea of joining government and embraced opposition politics. Labour was at the height of its powers and, for Māori, a party was needed to hold the major left wing force to account on issues from Ihumātao to housing prices. This is where the Greens can take their inspiration from Metiria Turei again. In 2016 the former Green party co-leader said that house prices must drop. Almost six years later, as every suburb in the country records a median house price increase, where is the opposition party brave enough to say the same again?

1/23/2022,"Several years ago a friend packed a batch of premixed cosmopolitans on his first multiday hike. It took until the first night to realise that the warm, syrupy liquid wasn’t quite as refreshing as he’d hoped in the tropical heat of north Queensland, but if he’d been on the Grampians Peaks Trail (GPT) in western Victoria, it might have been a different story. The second night of the brand new 13-day trail is spent at a campsite named Gar, which hugs the lip of an escarpment above a thickly forested bowl, ringed in tiers by jagged mountains that rise up like the walls of a colosseum. Tent platforms are democratically arranged along the cliff edge so that everyone has a view to the west, while the vegetation between the tents and the sheer rock wall behind provides a welcome sense of privacy.  Nearby sits an elegant shelter of steel clad in blackened timber with west-facing floor-to-ceiling windows and a solar-powered USB charging station, while the wooden deckchairs bolted into the rock are a nice extra touch (even without a cocktail in hand). Sitting in one as the sun turns into a giant fireball and a golden haze hovers over the valley below, it’s impossible to deny that Gar is one of Australia’s most picturesque campsites, though over the next week and a half I’ll find a few other contenders further down the track. Opened in November 2021 after several years of construction, the 160km GPT passes through open forest and flower-studded grassland, ascends quartz-capped mountain peaks and skirts shimmering lakes as it crosses the Grampians (Gariwerd) national park from north to south. The trail is divided into three sections of four to five days each, and because it connects existing tracks with 100km of newly built trail, it opens up parts of the park that have previously been all but inaccessible to walkers. Within metres of taking my first step on day one, I’ve worked up a sweat as I climb the steep, exposed slope of cruelly named Flat Rock. It’s hot work, especially in the full sun, but the payoff arrives quickly. From the open space at the top of this initial ascent, I can see the pancake-flat plains of the Wimmera stretching out into oblivion – neatly arrayed olive groves and viciously straight fence lines contrasting markedly with the gnarled formations that still tower over me in the other direction. Nobody could accuse this hike of hiding its true nature; whether you tackle a few hours or the full 160km, you’ll encounter plenty of steep climbs and spectacular lookouts. Rugged peaks of cracked rubble rise above a wall of vivid orange sandstone and throughout the northern section of the walk there are unexpected echoes of Purnululu’s beehive domes. As I progress farther, views to the south reveal a sharp spine of peaks thrusting up from the surrounding plains, each looking like a wave arrested on the point of breaking. Days of between eight and 16km might sound like a breeze for seasoned multiday hikers, but ungroomed paths and significant elevation changes conspire to make walking times significantly longer than expected. By the time I walk into Halls Gap at the end of day four (the only night not spent at a campsite) I feel like I’ve thoroughly earned a warm shower and a cold drink. In the days on either side of the town, I encounter several walkers tackling short sections of the GPT but they thin out significantly as I continue south. It means I have the entire landscape to myself for days at a time as I scale rocky ridges, climbing up innumerable stone steps and across broad slabs that absorb and radiate the sun’s heat. The hike’s exposed nature means the GPT is definitely not a summer walk – autumn and spring are the best times to tackle it, with the latter bringing an abundance of wildflowers. A third of Victoria’s plant species – almost 1,000 in all – are found within the region, and when I reach the Duwul campsite at the end of day seven, my tent platform is surrounded by yellow and maroon native peas, shy curls of flame grevillea and delicate lilac orchids blooming beneath rough barked gums, wreathed in a halo of crimson flowers. For days afterwards the way ahead is fringed by splashes of red, white and pink as the trail skirts the easternmost edge of the Grampians, through sections of grade 5 track suitable only for experienced and well-equipped bushwalkers. It means walking the entirety of the trail is a serious undertaking and of the first 2,000 campsite bookings, only eight hikers planned to tackle the full 13 days. On some of the tougher sections I wonder whether I’m being foolhardy by joining their ranks but the joys of hiking in this quintessentially Australian landscape come regularly to the fore. By the final night of the hike I can see the southernmost slopes of the Grampians and the small town of Dunkeld reflected in the window of the Mud-Dadjug shelter. Over a makeshift dinner of leftovers, I enjoy a front-row seat as the setting sun adds a honeyed glow to everything it touches, while the town lights flicker on beneath a lilac and apricot sky. Above them looms the dark blue mass of Mt Sturgeon, a reminder that even on the final stretch, I can expect some challenging climbs and spectacular lookouts. If a 13-day hike is a step too far, there are many more approachable alternatives, especially in the park’s northern section. Day hike: From Halls Gap, ascend past burbling cascades and waterfalls, through bushland rich in wildlife to a deep cleft in the rock before emerging at The Pinnacle for fabulous views of the town and surrounding landscape. Overnight: The first day of the GPT follows the rich orange rock of Taipan Wall past seasonal creeks and waterfalls to the Barigar campsite, which sits in a sheltered valley and looks east towards a striking escarpment. In the morning, it’s a 4km walk to the Gar trailhead. Multiday: Take in some of the highlights of the trail on the four-day northern section, which includes two of the most striking campsites at Gar and Werdug, before walking into Halls Gap. Guided walks also tackle this stage.

1/23/2022,"Last week, a prominent member of the Liberals’ right faction, Tim James, snared the safe New South Wales state seat of Willoughby replacing the former Liberal premier Gladys Berejiklian, a leading moderate, in the lower north shore Sydney seat. No one saw it coming. The lower north shore is a moderate stronghold within the party and the popular former Willoughby council mayor Gail Giles-Gidney, a moderate with a high local profile, was seen as the frontrunner.  Giles-Gidney had the endorsement of the people who count in those parts: Berejiklian and the moderate powerbroker Trent Zimmerman, the federal MP for North Sydney. But by the end of a three-hour preselection meeting attended by more than 100 members of the local branch and state executive, moderates were left shellshocked. The new “Warringah rules” for choosing the candidate via a plebiscite of local members, with a 25% voting component from the state executive, had delivered an unexpected result. James, an acolyte of the former prime minister Tony Abbott with a record of pushing development of gas and opposing higher carbon emissions reduction targets, was on his way to becoming the member for Willoughby. Just a suburban soap opera? Or a sign of something deeper happening in the NSW Liberal party? In other states, notably Western Australia and South Australia, there has been an influx into the party of conservative members recruited from Pentecostal churches and other religious groups. It has fundamentally changed the Liberal party in WA and caused tensions in SA. In Queensland there were similar concerns in 2020 about the growing influence of climate-denying Christian conservatives. In Victoria, there have been highly publicised reports of organised attempts at branch stacking by the conservative right, including recruitment drives run out of MPs’ offices. But in NSW, at least on the surface, there appeared to be peace within the warring factions, of which there are three: the moderates, the hard right and the smaller centre right. The hard right is dominated by conservative Catholics with the premier, Dominic Perrottet, its poster boy. The centre right, controlled by the federal immigration minister, Alex Hawke, is more closely aligned with Pentecostal and Protestant churches and boasts Scott Morrison as its high-profile member. The moderates are led by the NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, and Zimmerman. The animus between the factions a decade ago, when John Brogden was the state opposition leader, is legendary: brawls in local branches, fierce branch stacking and chronic destabilisation of the parliamentary leader. During this time the right also split, mainly on sectarian lines. But after a decade in the wilderness a desperate Barry O’Farrell convinced the factions they should declare a detente in the interests of winning government. The peace was cemented under Berejiklian. Hard-right leaders like Perrottet, who has been a central player in the factions since he was in the Young Liberals, and Damien Tudehope, who commands influence in the north-west of Sydney, prospered, becoming treasurer and finance minister. David Elliott, a leading figure of the centre right, has risen too. So did the leading moderates such as Kean. At least in cabinet, the factions had checked their weapons at the door. But there was always the question of who would succeed Berejiklian. About three years ago, Kean is said to have struck a further deal with Perrottet to make Perrottet premier, even though he came from the right, while Kean would become treasurer. Until that point the moderates, the biggest faction, had laid claim to the premier’s job. Kean and Perrotett have never confirmed the deal, but subsequent events appear to confirm it. Despite a senior moderate, Rob Stokes, nominating for premier after Berejiklian resigned, Perrottet won with support from Kean’s bloc of moderates. Both men have now risen to the top before turning 40: Perrottet as premier and Kean his treasurer. But has the deal emboldened the right and diminished the moderates? “It’s been the best infiltration I have seen in my life,” says one disillusioned moderate. “Rather than beat us up, they got us to do what they want.” How much Perrottet’s rise has strengthened the right is debated within the party – there have so far been no attempts to push a conservative social agenda. “Perrottet is not offensive to most moderates – he mainly sticks to economic issues and he’s endorsed net zero by 2050,” says a senior moderate. “I don’t think he’s sitting watching Sky after Dark night after night. He’s probably reading Margaret Thatcher’s biography – and we can live with that.” But the new rules for preselecting candidates have provided an avenue for increased influence and there are signs right operatives are active. “The right are taking the car out for a spin to see what’s possible,” says one factional player who asked not to be named. Abbott’s original Warringah rules establishing branch member plebiscites to choose candidates were substantially modified before being adopted. Safeguards against branch stacking, such as being a member for two years and monthly limits on new members signing up, were included. A quarter of the vote was allocated to the state executive council in the broader party interest. James’s preselection, only the second under the new rules, raises questions about whether the moderates have underestimated the right. James, a long-time participant in the faction, had hoped to succeed Abbott in the federal northern beaches seat of Warringah until the independent Zali Steggall made it unwinnable for a person with a track record of support for fossil fuels. James has also made two unsuccessful tilts at the state seat of North Shore, also regarded as moderate territory. So Willoughby was a real surprise. There were about 110 selectors assembled for the preselection on 12 January. James came second to Giles-Gidney in the first round of voting but edged her out in the second round. “He was just hungrier for it,” said one attendee. By all accounts he gave a strong speech and demonstrated his policy depth as a former director of the Menzies Research Centre. Some say Covid-19 played a role, with older members who supported Giles-Gidney reluctant to attend in person. The NSW Liberal party said: “There were three outstanding candidates contesting the preselection, with Tim James selected by members to represent the party at the upcoming election, based on his vision for the community.” James had a bloc of 11 Young Liberals from the right who were eligible to vote under party rules that allow Young Liberals to attend branches where they live or adjoining branches. They included Thomas Ryan, who is married to Francesca Perrottet , the premier’s sister; Anthony Swales, an electorate staffer for state minister Anthony Roberts; Pierre Okosdinossian, a graduate of Redfield College, the conservative Catholic school attended by Perrottet; and Benedict Kang, In 2018 Kang wrote in the conservative Spectator: “At the heart of the political process is grassroots action … Something is astir in the air, and the winds of change, of reform, are blowing. This article may very well be prophetic, and I sincerely hope that it is. Join a party, be the conservative voice, change the tide of battle. Believe me, there has never been a better time to be young, restless, and right-wing.” There is clear evidence elsewhere that conservatives have heeded the call and signed up to branches in anticipation of the Warringah rules. Branches that had just five or 10 members have seen numbers swell to the 30s in the past two and half years. The MP most under threat is the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, in the seat of Farrer in southern NSW. She is facing a challenge from conservative Christian Ellis, a member of the right faction, who moved to Deniliquin from Sydney. He previously worked for Perrottet and the former federal resources minister Matt Canavan. He also ran as a candidate for Family First against the Liberal Philip Ruddock, earning him a suspension from the party. Ellis was one of the organisers of a right group known as the NSW Reformers, which gained publicity in 2019 over a plan to recruit 5,000 members to the Liberal party through conservative churches. In Farrer, Ellis has been running on water issues and several members of the local group “Speak up for Water” have joined local branches. Unless there is an intervention by the state executive or by the prime minister, Ley will lose, local Liberals say. Since the Willoughby upset there are also concerns about what could occur in preselection for the federal seat of North Sydney, held by Zimmerman, which overlaps Willoughby. Until now, moderates have brushed off a preselection challenge from the right’s Hamish Stitt and the centre right’s Jessica Collins as a distraction with no chance. Now no one is so sure. Zimmerman declined to comment. And in the north-west of Sydney there are also renewed concerns about the seat of Mitchell, currently held by the centre right’s organiser, Hawke, but under challenge from the right. In a sign of the escalating competition between the factions, the Hills shire mayor, Michelle Byrne – backed by the centre right – found herself without a position on the Liberal ticket for the local government elections. “I don’t agree with the process that has taken place within the Liberal party or how we got here,” Byrne said in her resignation statement. So has there been a recruitment drive since in anticipation of greater democracy under the Warringah rules? A spokesman for the NSW Liberal party said numbers had steadily increased over the last five years but declined to give details. “The party welcomes new members from across the community, and we have had members continue to join us from a diverse range of geographic, socio-economic and cultural backgrounds,” he said. With a federal election due to be held by May, the NSW Liberals appears to have adopted a strategy of delaying remaining preselections rather than risking the uncertainties of the Warringah rules. There is constant talk of a peace deal to carve up the seats using urgency powers. “Whoever holds the parliamentary seats ends up being reflected in the culture and control of the party,” says one long-time factional player. “So what happens in this election will determine how much influence the right has in NSW. If North Sydney and Wentworth were to go [to independents], they are two very important seats held by the moderates,” he says. “While Morrison remains prime minister, then the centre right is a force, but they are the smallest group and query what happens if he is no longer the leader,” he says. And if the right claim more seats as well as the premiership, their influence will increase. “After the Willoughby result,” says a senior party member, “no one is at all confident about what’s happening.”",News/Australia news,The Right stuff: why shellshocked NSW Liberal moderates are fearing factional fights ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/23/the-right-stuff-why-shellshocked-nsw-liberal-moderates-are-fearing-factional-fights
1/23/2022,"A few years ago Dr Krati Garg, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon in Melbourne, was in theatre about to commence work on a patient when she told the anaesthetist she could smell sevoflurane. Sevoflurane is the anaesthetic gas used to put – and keep – patients asleep during surgery. Ingested via a tube that is placed down the throat, in large quantities its bitter smell can be noticeable, but trace amounts are largely indiscernible.  No one else in the room could smell it through their masks, but the anaesthetist, who’d worked with Garg before and knew of her sensitive nose, checked the fit of the tube, discovering a small leak and a need to adjust the seal. It’s not unusual for Garg to smell things that others can’t. She notices the smell of earth before it’s about to rain and at home with her husband, she’s overly prone to discarding food she thinks smells off, often saying to him: “It’s probably better that you taste and tell me if it’s off or not, because I might throw it out even without it going off.” Growing up in India, she was known in her family as having a super-sensitive nose, just like her grandmother. She’d astonish her mother by coming home from school and being able to describe the precise foods and spices used in the curries cooked in her absence. Certain smells gave her a strong aversion – even trace amounts of a particular rose-fragranced syrup, commonly used in milkshakes in India, made her recoil. The body odour of a private tutor her family had hired to help her with physics was so disconcerting, “I couldn’t focus at all … I would just try to stop, start my breathing. And then I would look at the clock. After a few months, I said to my mum: ‘Look, I can’t sit.’ And we had to let him go.” While understanding that she has a heightened sense of smell has been a “continuous process” throughout Garg’s life, this year she started becoming more curious about this skill. Working in healthcare in Melbourne, she was being regularly tested for Covid-19, but noticed she was also “subconsciously” running her own early-warning testing system, by constantly checking in on her sense of smell. (Loss of smell is a symptom of Covid infection.) After reading up on the topic, Garg came to the conclusion that she was possibly a “super-smeller” – a rare condition, medically known as hyperosmia. Dr Leah Beauchamp, a neuroscientist at the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Melbourne, says individual “olfactory acuity” – our ability to smell – is highly variable and altered by genetics, age, gender (women have a stronger sense of smell) and even mood. Our sense of smell occurs via a complex process, where an odour molecule enters the nose and hits a patch of tissue – “basically at the place where you get your Covid test” – from where electrical impulses travel to various regions within the brain for interpretation. Not a lot is known about those on the outer edges of smelling ability – it’s rare, and subjective, which makes it difficult to measure. According to Beauchamp, it is theorised that hyperosmia could be biological – it’s known that changes in hormones and electrolytes associated with medical differences, such has pregnancy or Lyme diseases, heighten smell sensitivity – and also that is can be learned; a sommelier, for example. One of the most extreme cases of a super-smeller to emerge in recent years – now being studied in the UK – is a Scottish woman who noticed a certain “musty smell” on her husband in the years preceding his diagnosis with Parkinson’s disease. It was only once she walked into a support group for people living with Parkinson’s that she realised the scent was common among them. “Someone with that kind of acuity is basically off the charts,” says Beauchamp. “But you do get variability in humans. That’s how biology works.” For Beauchamp, it is the absence of a sense of smell that offers the most intriguing grounds for research. “Smell is great opportunity for us to access the brain … People think that sense of smell is all about the nose, and the nose is important obviously, but it really gives us an indication of brain health.” The Florey institute has a number of projects investigating smell deficits, including one examining why a cohort of people in Melbourne still have no sense of smell up to 12 months after recovering from Covid. It’s unlikely that someone like Garg would ever get – or need – an official diagnosis of hyperosmia. Beauchamp says that unless it is “disturbing day-to-day function … they wouldn’t need to get it treated”. Garg says that simply being aware of her ability is enough for her. “I almost feel empowered in some ways that I’ve got this little extra strength or tool.” Being a super-smeller means she occasionally having to take evasive action, like “staying away from a particular group of people because someone’s wearing a very strong perfume in a party”. It also means navigating intense memories. Unlike other senses, the area of the brain that processes smell directly receives information from the part of the brain associated with memory, the hippocampus. For Garg, a certain “damp” smell takes her back to the stressful experience of having her house flooded as a child; conversely, the smell of petrol, which she “quite likes”, overwhelms her with nostalgia for her childhood in India. “There are people who actually come and fill it for you and you just sit in the car with your windows down, or you’re on your two-wheeler and you can smell it with the dust and everything.”",News/Society,"‘I’ve got this little extra strength’: the rare, intense world of a super smeller ",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/23/ive-got-this-little-extra-strength-the-rare-intense-world-of-a-super-smeller
1/23/2022,"Australian adults who are being bullied online will be able to report incidents to the eSafety commissioner from Sunday. New powers were given to the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, as part of the wide-ranging Online Safety Act, which passed in 2021. Under the new laws, social media companies and other websites will be compelled to remove content deemed to be bullying within 24 hours or face fines of up to 500 penalty units (up to $111,000 for individuals and up to $555,000 for companies).  The laws also modify a scheme already in place for reporting the online bullying of children, broadening who they apply to beyond social media platforms, and shortening the removal timeframe to 24 hours from 48 hours. Here’s what we know about how the system will work. Under the scheme, you first need to ask for the bullying content to be removed by the company that is hosting it, such as Facebook or Twitter. You should also report it to the police. It remains a crime to harass people online, and the eSafety commissioner’s powers only extend to the removal of content, not legal action. If the platform or website fails to remove the content, you can report it to the commissioner, who can launch an investigation and issue notices for the content to be removed within 24 hours, or the host risks a fine. The government has sought to downplay concerns the scheme would amount to censorship of speech by setting the bar “deliberately high”, Inman Grant said. Content is considered adult cyber abuse if it is intended to cause serious harm and is menacing, harassing or offensive, and targeted at an individual. You cannot report offensive comments said about minority groups for example. “Serious harm could include material which sets out realistic threats, places people in real danger, is excessively malicious or is unrelenting,” Inman Grant said. Something people find offensive or disagreeable on its own would not be enough. “The scheme is not intended to regulate hurt feelings, purely reputational damage, bad online reviews, strong opinions or banter,” she said. It won’t cover defamatory comments, either. In a submission to the parliamentary inquiry into social media and online safety, Inman Grant said examples of what would reach the threshold would be publishing private or identifying information about someone with malicious intent, encouraging violence against an Australian adult based on their religion, race or sexuality, and threats of violence. If a notice is issued to remove content, the legislation requires there be a process for a decision to be reviewed by the office of the eSafety commissioner. The decision can also be appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. At the end of last year, Scott Morrison announced draft anti-trolling legislation, which is separate from the Online Safety Act. The anti-trolling legislation is largely focused on making it easier for people to unmask anonymous online commenters who they want to sue for defamation. Under the draft legislation, social media companies can be fined and potentially held liable for defamatory comments posted online by commenters if they do not assist in unmasking the anonymous commenter. The government is still seeking comment on the legislation and it is not entirely clear whether it will be introduced or passed in parliament before the federal election. The Online Safety Act also gives the commissioner significant powers over the regulation of other content online – including adult content. The commissioner is currently working with industry on developing codes to enforce the new rules around adult content, with a view to developing a roadmap to require age verification for adult content online by the end of this year.",News/Media,How will new laws help stop Australians being bullied online?,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/23/how-will-new-laws-help-stop-australians-being-bullied-online
1/23/2022,"The debate about potential school closures or delays has initiated discussions about children’s mental health once again. Kids are very resilient, but the impacts of Covid-19 have been big – and continuing. Childhood mental health is important because it lays the foundations for social and emotional wellbeing in later life. The good news is parents and carers can positively influence their children’s wellbeing, and “good enough” parenting can have a meaningful impact.  At the population level, there were increasing rates of psychological distress in children prior to the pandemic and this has further increased during the pandemic. Lockdowns and having parents or carers who are also experiencing psychological distress are associated with poor mental health in children and adolescents. Fortunately, in Australia Covid has not to date been associated with a rise in suspected deaths by suicide. And a 2022 Canadian study found no increases in self-harm presentations in teens. Though a NSW study found an increase in mental health presentations to emergency departments through Covid times. And in Australia, more people of all ages have been seeking mental healthcare through 2020 and 2021. For instance, the Australian Kids Helpline has experienced a 17% increase in calls compared with pre-pandemic. The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms during Covid has doubled for children. Initially we found creative ways to address Covid stress – remember all those dance parties on TikTok? Adults and children are now weary. Chronic stressors are known to be particularly challenging. As the pandemic enters its third year, evidence is showing that lasting mental health challenges are unevenly affecting those with financial issues, those who have had Covid or lost someone to Covid and those whose mental health was poor before the pandemic. Some have faced enormous challenges; others feel “blah”, lacking motivation and focus. An Australian study showed though that some older children (12-18yrs) have had positive experiences during Covid. Some have benefited from more family time, a slower pace of life and more control over one’s day. We have only a handful of studies regarding the singular effect of school closures (or delays, or online learning) on children’s mental health – it is not easy to tease out impacts of the pandemic itself compared with school closures. Existing studies typically ask the parents’ view, and study teens. A 2021 analysis in JAMA Pediatrics showed school closures may only modestly reduce pandemic spread. Disruptions, change in teachers can in themselves cause distress in children … but kids need socialisation and quality education. Emerging research shows that masks have not adversely affected children’s emotional development. You might remember the famous study by Tronick back in 1975, called the Still Face experiment. In the study, when parents were instructed to keep a straight face, their kids withdrew and got upset. Some people have worried masks would have the same effect. But initial studies into adult mask wearing and primary school kids’ reactions have shown children continue to interact and perceive emotions as they did before. Parents are stressed by decision-making and risk assessments. Parental stress has a significant impact upon child mental health. So it’s worth keeping in mind the suggestions below can boost mental health for adults and kids. Prioritise your own mental wellbeing. Give yourself permission to do the things that might give you a lift, even if only temporary, and take a break from what drains you. Seek social connections that feel safe, and keep the basics – enough sleep, eating well and keeping physically active. Allow space and time for enjoying your child. Positive relationships and play, silliness and sharing in fun activities protect our mental wellbeing and that of our children. In you, your child has their best resource. Consider the opportunities for teaching your child mental wellbeing skills, like accepting feelings. Accepting the full range of feelings helps children with emotion regulation. There is no need to hurry your children out of “negative feelings” – listening, comforting, being there and riding it out is enough. Breakdowns in relationships between parents and kids happen. Repair matters. Parents can role-model repair by expressing warmth, talking about what happened, and apologising. Remember that perfect parenting is not required to raise psychologically healthy children. Good quality information can reduce fear and uncertainty for all. Giving your child manageable amounts of accurate, age-appropriate information can help alleviate concerns. Follow your child’s questions and resist the urge to provide too much reassurance (paradoxically, this sometimes makes fears stronger). Prevent Covid infection, if you can. A Lancet article reports that adults who have been infected with Covid-19 are at an increased risk for anxiety and mood disorders after the infection compared with other infections (we don’t know if the risk is similar for children). Give time for unstructured play (like making a fort) – it is key to the development of self-esteem, self-determination and the ability to self-regulate, all vital parts of emotional development that help prevent mental health challenges. Positive event scheduling (that is, doing things you enjoy) prevents and treats depression, done together it can also strengthen relationships. This could be as simple as a card game together. Worries about Covid and other worries should not usually be thought of as a mental illness. Courage challenges can help children overcome their worries and build confidence in themselves (for example, learning to jump into water). Given exposure to a chronic stressor, most people will have engaged in some negative parenting. Be kind to yourself. Humans are amazingly resilient. We have surprisingly useful abilities to make the best of a bad situation. Good-enough parenting is all it takes. You are your child’s best resource. Stabilising emotional wellbeing through connection, fun and play can recharge the whole family’s battery. Professor Alexandra Martiniuk is an epidemiologist at the University of Sydney.

1/23/2022,"The man convicted of the cold case murder of US mathematician Scott Johnson has lodged an appeal, only days after he stunned his lawyers by pleading guilty. Lawyers for Scott White, 50, lodged an appeal this week in the New South Wales court of criminal appeal against his conviction, Guardian Australia has confirmed.  The appeal marks another significant development in a death that was initially dismissed as a suicide by NSW police and had been subject to three coronial inquests, before being investigated by detectives as a gay hate crime with a $2m reward for information. Johnson, 27, was found dead at the base of a cliff near Manly’s North Head in 1988. The area was a popular meeting spot for gay men. In 2017, coroner Michael Barnes found Johnson fell from the cliff “as a result of actual or threatened violence” by people who attacked him over his sexuality. Barnes criticised the initial police investigation as inadequate and found it likely more than one person ambushed Johnson. Police launched a new investigation and announced the reward in 2018. White was arrested in May, 2020. During a supreme court hearing on 10 January, White made the remarkable admission that he was guilty of murdering Johnson. White’s publicly-funded lawyers immediately appealed his decision to plead guilty, arguing the plea should be vacated because of White’s cognitive impairment, his previous insistence he was innocent, his failure to tell lawyers he planned to change his plea, and his extreme agitation on the day of the hearing. The integrity of the plea was so undermined that to hold White to it would constitute a miscarriage of justice, his lawyers argued. As part of their submissions, his lawyers included the notes of a conversation they had in the cells with White immediately after he made the plea. “I’m really sorry to all of you, I appreciate all your work, but I can’t handle it,” White said, according to notes taken of the meeting and the recollection of his legal aid lawyer, Louise Sutherland. “If I get out she’ll just come after me again, I can’t do it, I just can’t, I’m sorry. I am better off in here. I’m safe in here. This is too much stress.” The reference to “she” was clarified to be a reference to his former wife, who had been expected to give evidence against White. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “You told us before court you were going to say not guilty and you have told us consistently that you didn’t do it,” Belinda Rigg SC, White’s senior counsel and the NSW senior public defender, replied. “I didn’t. I didn’t do it, but I’m saying I did it, you know what I mean. I’m saying that. 10 years, I’ll take that,” White said. Rigg and White continued to speak, according to the file note, with Rigg telling White he would not receive a sentence as low as 10 years, and reiterating that a guilty plea meant he was “telling the whole world” he killed Johnson.

White was asked what he would say if he was again asked to plead. “Not guilty,” he confirms. White later signed legal instructions which read in part: “Today I was confused … I was stressed. I’ve had no food, no sleep, no shower. I saw the brother of the deceased in court. I saw police point at me … I maintain that I didn’t cause Scott Johnson’s death.” In a decision handed down on 13 January, NSW supreme court judge Helen Wilson rejected the application to vacate the guilty plea. The application had been opposed by the prosecution. In her decision, it was made clear that part of the evidence against White included recorded conversations he had with two undercover police operatives. Wilson listed 12 matters she had considered as part of her decision, including that White had not raised his innocence in the conversation under the cells until it was mentioned by his lawyers, and that he had given considered reasons for his plea which had “a flavour to them of remorse for and acceptance of responsibility for Dr Johnson’s death”. White had been found by multiple experts to be mentally fit to plead, and while Wilson agreed that he was cognitively impaired, either because of intellectual disability, alcohol-related brain damage, or a combination of the two, that was “immaterial for present purposes”. “I accept that he functions socially and intellectually at a level well below that of most people in the community and he is thereby disadvantaged,” she found.

1/23/2022,"When customers walk through the doors of V’s Punjabi Grill, a family-run restaurant in Gravesend in Kent, the sign above their heads says in gold-letters: cocktails, grills, events. Now, the family might need to paint a fourth bullet point: vaccinations.  After their father, Jagtar Chopra, was hospitalised with Covid in December 2020, brothers Rav and Raj Chopra were inspired to immunise the local community from their Punjabi grill. The brothers’ kebab shop is one of hundreds of little walk-in vaccine centres, alongside sports stadiums and shopping centres and nightclubs, that form part of the NHS’s wider vaccination programme. It opened on 10 January in a marquee attached to the restaurant and has already immunised dozens of people. “Come down, get your jabs” to “protect everyone in society”, said Rav Chopra, who along with his brother is also a pharmacist. Raj, 43, told the PA news agency he was inspired by the experience of his 74-year-old father, who has since fully recovered, in battling the virus. “From a personal point of view, it was very debilitating to see Dad like that,” said Raj. “It got everyone’s emotions in play. “To see it hit home so close to our hearts, it was a very tough pill – pardon the pun – to take. However, every cloud has a silver lining and it’s inspired us to really emphasise the job that we do, help the community and help out the fellow citizens in our home town and really try and protect as many people as we can.” His father, Jagtar, believed he would succumb to the virus. “I thought I wasn’t going to make it, it was so bad,” he said. “I was in hospital for about six nights and I was really, really ill, but thanks to all the doctors, all the staff, I pulled through.” V’s Punjabi Grill vaccination hub has attracted the attention of politicians. The Conservative MP for Gravesham, Adam Holloway, praised the “fabulous” initiative to boost the rollout. “Here, the provision has been quite patchy,” Holloway told PA. “What’s great about this is that these guys are prepared to ramp up” the booster campaign. “We must remember that while we’re coming out, God willing, of the pandemic, and into an endemic phase, this current variant is not the last one we’re going to have,” he added. “So these guys are showing real health entrepreneurialism operating out of the back of a restaurant in the middle of Gravesend. It’s a fabulous thing.”",News/World news,Kebabs ’n’ jabs: the Punjabi grill in Gravesend offering a side of Covid shots,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/kebabs-n-jabs-the-punjabi-grill-in-gravesend-offering-a-side-of-covid-shots
1/23/2022,"The UK detected 76,807 new Covid infections in the past 24 hours, a 54% drop on the 176,191 cases detected two weeks ago as the record-breaking Omicron wave appears to have spiked. The UK reported a further 297 people died within 28 days of a positive Covid test on Saturday, 3% up on the 287 deaths reported last Saturday. Over 177,000 people in the UK have Covid on their death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics, the seventh highest tally in the world.  It comes after the health secretary, Sajid Javid, reiterated his message the UK is “learning to live with” Covid. Javid confirmed steps on Wednesday to axe virtually all Covid restrictions in England despite warnings from senior NHS figures it could provoke a resurgent wave. Javid said: “Our exceptional vaccine rollout means the number of people severely affected by Covid-19 is low, and the UK’s innovation and research has discovered life-saving treatments for those most at risk.” Ahead of the deadline for England’s NHS workers to be vaccinated or lose their jobs on 1 April, Dr Nikki Kanani, deputy lead for the NHS Covid vaccination programme, said it’s the “duty” of staff to protect patients. Kanani’s comments were made amid protests against mandatory vaccines in London on Saturday. Meanwhile, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has designated the Omicron offshoot known as BA.2, which has a potentially higher growth rate, a “variant under investigation” – but virologists have said there’s no immediate cause for concern. The UKHSA’s decision comes as cases of BA.2 climb internationally. Infections from the BA.2 offshoot remain low in the UK but now make up almost half of Omicron cases in Denmark. The UK has sequenced 426 cases of Omicron BA.2, the UKHSA said on Friday, with the agency investigating the significance of its viral mutations. Early indications suggest an “increased growth rate” than the already highly mutated Omicron BA.1 variant but there’s a “low level of certainty” without further analysis. UKHSA did not designate BA.2 a “variant of concern,” the highest rank of risk. The UK’s first confirmed case was confirmed by genome sequencing on 6 December. “So far, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether BA.2 causes more severe illness than Omicron BA.1, but data is limited and UKHSA continues to investigate,” Meera Chand, Covid-19 incident director at UKHSA, said in a statement on Friday. Chand said it’s natural for viruses to evolve and mutate and the pandemic will continue to see new variants emerge, adding: “Case rates remain high throughout the UK and we must remain vigilant and take up vaccinations. We should all continue to test regularly with LFDs and take a PCR test if symptoms develop.” London has detected 146 BA.2 cases and south-east England has confirmed 97. In total, 8,040 sequences of the Omicron offshoot have been uploaded to the international GISAID database from 40 countries. “Initial analysis shows no differences in hospitalisations for BA.2 compared to BA.1,” Denmark’s Statens Serum Institut said on Thursday. The institute added tests on vaccine efficacy are ongoing but “it is expected that vaccines also have an effect against severe illness upon BA.2 infection”. Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College, said in a Twitter thread, as countries near or pass their Omicron BA.1 peaks: “I would be very surprised if BA.2 caused a second wave at this point.” As its been getting increasing attention recently, I'm going to write a short thread on what we currently know about BA.2.-what is BA.2?-what is BA.2 doing currently?-Should we be concerned about it? Other countries to confirm more than 100 BA.2 samples include India (530), Singapore (127) and Sweden (181). Addressing BA.2, Javid said: “Thanks to our world-leading surveillance system we can rapidly detect and carefully monitor any genetic changes to Covid-19.”",News/World news,Daily Covid infections in UK less than half recorded two weeks ago,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/daily-covid-infections-in-uk-less-than-half-recorded-two-weeks-ago
1/23/2022,"The well-heeled shoppers strolling through the grand promenade and pleasure gardens of Cheltenham’s prosperous centre might be expected to offer Boris Johnson’s bruised government some desperately needed respite. But the mere mention of the prime minister’s name provokes a reception as frosty as the chill air sweeping the Cotswolds spa town. Outside the House of Fraser department store, Chris Carter, 74, is fed up with the man he helped put into No 10. “I don’t like the bloke – I’m not happy,” says Carter, clutching some bags. “He is hiding lots of things. He’s only saying sorry when he’s caught out [over the parties in Downing Street], but there is more to come out. It’s not just parties – what else is he lying about?”  Carter, who has voted Conservative all his life, also worries about the other more devastating crisis that threatens the Tories’ electoral fortunes: the rising cost of living. The potential for the average household gas and electric bill to jump by £700 a year when the price cap changes in April is on his mind. “It won’t affect rich people. Poorer people will be desperate. And people [like us] in the middle won’t get any help at all,” he says. “I couldn’t vote Labour; I would probably vote Liberal [if there was an election tomorrow].” This will worry local and national Conservatives. Cheltenham is finely balanced between the Tories and the Lib Dems. The town was staunchly Liberal Democrat for 23 years until the Tories captured it in 2015. The current Conservative MP, Alex Chalk, whom Johnson appointed solicitor general, has a small majority of 981 votes. It would take a swing of less than 1% to turn it from blue to yellow. Rising prices are not only eating away at people’s stagnating wages – they are eroding Tory support in the south, just as much as in former “red wall” seats in the Midlands and north. In an upmarket salon on the corner of two Regency terraces, one of the hairdressers, James Wellings, 41, is feeling the squeeze and tiring of the party he voted for in 2019. “I’m a single dad. You really feel the pinch,” he explains as a customer waits patiently. “On the weeks I don’t have my son I go through the dregs of what’s in the freezer so at least I can get him some nice stuff when he stays with me. [My son] doesn’t ask to have things any more – he asks if we can afford things. He’s learned from me.” Wellings is not sure who he would vote for now, but is leaning towards Labour. “I voted Conservative [in 2019] because I thought they were the best of a bad bunch. But am I impressed with the government? No. Am I happy with how they have dealt with things? No,” he says. “It’s frustrating when you have a prime minister who describes his salary [for writing a newspaper column when he was mayor of London] as ‘chicken feed’. They are out of touch.” Even those planning to vote Conservative again struggle to find anything positive to say about the PM. William Mortimer Moore, an author and landlord, remarks: “I never liked Boris. He’s a bit seat of the pants, he wouldn’t necessarily tell the truth, takes liberties, messy personal life.” Away from the tourists and moneyed shoppers, there is another, poorer side of Cheltenham. Here low wages, inadequate benefits and rising costs are pushing many into debt and drastic cutbacks to make ends meet. Anne Crockard, 62, who earns the minimum wage as a healthcare assistant, fears she will not be able to retire. “They need to put wages up. I’m working more hours than I have ever worked. I do 48-50 hours a week,” she says. “It’s hard work. It’s not good for me any more – hoisting up old people. I’ve got a bad back. But I have to do the hours to pay the rent and the bills. It’s horrendous.” Crockard, who voted for Johnson’s Conservatives in the last election, is not convinced by any of the leaders yet. “[Johnson’s] let the side down. But who are we going to choose next?” Jade Brock, 25, who cares for her two children and works part-time as a shop assistant, has ended up in rent arrears. “My food shop used to be £60 – now it’s £100. My weekly energy costs have gone from £20 to £40,” she adds, after listening to Crockard. “I’m in arrears. I want to get out of it but I can’t do more hours because I’ve got two kids.” Gregory Orchard, 29, cannot move out of home even though he is working full time in a DIY store. “It’s depressing – I just try to struggle on through,” he says. His family often can’t afford to turn the heating on and fear the coming increase in energy bills. “We’ve never got the heating on. We can’t afford to. We sit there with three of four layers on,” he says. His friend, Jemma Ward, 29, who gets a carer’s allowance, puts her four children first, which increasingly means she goes without. “The first priority is them,” she says. “It does get you down because you are hungry and you’ve got no energy to look after them, but you have to keep going.”",News/Politics,‘They are out of touch’: chilly Cheltenham gives Boris Johnson’s Tories cold comfort,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/22/they-are-out-of-touch-chilly-cheltenham-gives-boris-johnsons-tories-cold-comfort
