4/7/2022,"A teenage gorilla in a Chicago zoo has been getting too much screen time, according to zoo officials. Amare, a 415-pound gorilla at Chicago’s Lincoln Park zoo, has been staring a little too frequently at the screens of cellphones from visitors who show him pictures and videos through the glass wall – including selfies, family photos, pet videos and even footage of Amare himself. He has apparently become so distracted as a result that last week, when another teenage gorilla rushed at him in a show of aggression, Amare did not appear to notice. “It seemed to almost surprise Amare because his attention was very much distracted,” said Stephen Ross, the director of the Lester E Fisher Center for the Study and Conservation of Apes, to the Chicago Sun Times. In recent months, zoo staff have had to install a rope line to keep visitors several feet away from the glass and have had to step in to explain why the phone screens were a problem. “It’s probably a cyclical phenomena: the more he shows interest, the more people want to engage in it,” Ross said. Three other male ‘bachelor’ gorillas live in the same enclosure with Amare, and zoo officials are worried that they, too, might also become addicted to screens. “It’s within the realm of possibility and something we really want to get ahead of,” said Ross. “What we’re keeping an eye on here is that he doesn’t end up watching screens that the visitors are presenting him for hours on end. It’s more of a quantity issue than a quality issue. If we can all sort of agree that we want to do what’s best for the animals, then we can sort of resist that desire to sit there and flip through pictures for an hour with him.”",News/US news,Chicago zoo concerned that exposure to phone screens has teen gorilla addicted ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/06/gorilla-chicago-zoo-screen-time
4/7/2022,"Spoiler alert: this article is for people watching Moon Knight on Disney+. Do not read unless you have seen episodes one and two. After the slightly muted but largely positive reaction to Moon Knight’s screen debut last week, we reach episode two: Summon the Suit. Would Steven discover why he’s been moonlighting (sorry) as a crimefighting hero after dark? Would we ever establish which London museum he’s supposed to be working at? And will we forgive the accent now we know it’s essentially Marc Spector putting it on? One thing I have been thinking about since last week is who it might be on the end of the phone when Steven calls his mum and leaves voicemails. We began with Steven chained to his bed, then saw him making his way to the British National Natural History Art Gallery and Albert Museum, and attempting to come clean about smashing up the toilets. Sadly for him and his gift shop career, there was nothing concrete on tape showing the jackal pursuit and it looks very much as if Steven vandalised the property. That was definitely Marc who emerged from the toilets and stared at the camera, however – the clue was in the fringe. It is also very likely that Marc was the face reflected in the table during the HR meeting. (Reflections are a big deal in Moon Knight, and after rewatching the first episode, I noticed a scene in which there were two reflections, possibly hinting at a further personality to come in future episodes.) You know when you are being chased by a fallen Egyptian deity because you have stolen its special scarab? And then your estranged wife arrives on a scooter to save you? Talk about timing. Despite some clunky expositional dialogue between her and Steven, the scene in Steven’s flat, in which it appeared that Marc – while constructing Steven’s personality – had borrowed liberally from Layla’s life (the French, the Egyptology) was illuminating, even moving. In spite of his looks and effortless ability to play swaggering characters such as X-wing ace Poe Dameron, he really is convincing as an out-of-his-depth, friendless museum nerd struggling with amnesia. Just as soon as Steven was taken by the shady police officers – completely fake and pretending, or real police under Harrow’s control? – he was given a tour of Harrow’s corner of the city, where crime has stopped and people can speak Mandarin while playing futsal. Everyone aspires to speak three languages, food is free, veganism is admired, young men from Mexico provide lentil soup recipes and Bob Dylan songs play over a loudspeaker. Interesting that in using his powers to try to create a utopia, Harrow has in fact recreated some of the more annoying enclaves of north London. During the conversation, we learned more about Khonshu and his quest for justice, and Harrow’s time as Khonshu’s avatar, before Marc took the mantle. Of course, how true all this turns out to be, devoid of context, is another matter, but it served to paint Khonshu and Moon Knight’s path as the villainous one and Harrow as the enlightened saviour. Thankfully Steven isn’t as daft as he sounds and quickly saw the grey area of pre-judging potentially innocent people, and that Ammit is indeed the evil element. After being hurled from a window by the jackal, Steven, resisting letting Marc take control of his body, summoned a suit of his own. This is the Mr Knight persona, a less violent, more cerebral version of Moon Knight not unlike Trebor’s Mr Soft, for those old enough and British enough to remember him. While Steven started to get the hang of his powers, he had to cede control to Marc and the full might of the Moon Knight, who quickly skewered the jackal on a monument and looked like a complete badass while doing so. Finally, we saw Steven and Marc level with each other in a way they haven’t managed yet, with Khonshu revealing himself to be something of a bully, albeit a bully with a magnificent, sonorous voice. On the whole, this was an entertaining episode, moving the story along nicely, revealing more about Harrow’s motives, introducing Layla and developing the relationship between Steven and Marc. I’m not too sure where the series is heading, but for now I am all aboard. Keep your eyes on the living statue. His reaction to Steven’s hug is the first time he has responded to the character at all, suggesting he is at least real and not a figment of Steven’s imagination. The actor, Shaun Scott, is listed on IMDb as Crawley. In the comics, Moon Knight regularly speaks to his homeless informant called Bertrand Crawley. Expect that statue to play a bigger part before the end of the series. When Steven asks Marc how long he has been Moon Knight and he answers “a long time”, how long do you think he means? Decades? Years? The expiry date on Marc’s passport was 15 December 2028. Good to know he has plenty of travelling ahead of him before he needs to renew. The DOB, meanwhile, and assuming the episode takes place in the present day, has Marc at 35. Oscar Isaac is 43, and is presumably a big fan of expensive moisturisers. For the scenes involving Steven and Marc talking to each other, Isaac hired his brother, Michael Hernandez, a journalist in Miami, to play against. The song playing over the final credits was El Melouk by Ahmed Saad ft 3enba & Double Zuksh. Are you buying Oscar Isaac in both roles? What did you think of Layla?

4/7/2022,"Peru’s beleaguered president, Pedro Castillo, is at the centre of a spiralling political crisis caused by rising fuel and fertiliser prices triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – and his own heavy-handed efforts to quell the unrest. On Tuesday Castillo lifted a curfew in Lima that he had decreed less than a day earlier in an attempt to quell sometimes violent protests over rising fuel and food prices. But the move came too late to defuse public anger. Demonstrators in downtown Lima fought with riot police who responded with teargas. Vandals and looters attacked buildings belonging to the judiciary, the public prosecutor’s office and the national electoral board. Shops were also smashed and looted on one of the city centre’s main thoroughfares. In the latest chapter in Peru’s chaotic politics, Castillo has appeared under attack from all sides amid a rising clamour of calls for him to step down. In just eight months in office, he has survived two impeachment attempts and rattled through four cabinets and more than 45 ministers. “In a country with a weak state, in a country with a lack of reforms, in a country which has a lot of social demands, he has been able to make things much worse in a very brief time,” said Eduardo Dargent, a political science professor at Lima’s Pontifical Catholic University. Fernando Tuesta, a political scientist, argued that the only way out of the crisis would be the resignation of the former schoolteacher followed by fresh elections. “His tenure is only a guarantee of instability, misgovernment and maintenance of the pipelines of corruption,” he said. “[Peru needs] new elections with political reform to have a light at the end of this long dark tunnel.” Castillo narrowly won the election last year with the backing of the rural poor but his support rapidly ebbed after a rash of bad decisions and allegations of corruption. At least one protester was killed on Wednesday in Ica region, around 300km south of the capital, pushing the death toll to six in the ongoing protests by farmers and transport workers over the soaring prices of fuel, food and fertiliser. School was cancelled for a second day on Wednesday due to security concerns.

4/7/2022,"Joe Biden announced the pause on federal student loan collections in the US will be extended until 31 August. The pause on federal student loans first started at the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 under the Trump administration. This is the seventh time the pause has seen an extension since then. “We are still recovering from the pandemic and the unprecedented economic disruption it caused,” Biden said in a statement Wednesday, adding that data from the Federal Reserve has suggested that if collections were to resume, “millions of student loan borrowers would face significant economic hardship, and delinquencies and defaults could threaten Americans’ financial stability”. Nearly 37 million borrowers have been affected by the pause, with a delay of $195bn of payments since the start of the pandemic, according to the Federal Reserve of New York. In addition to the extension, the White House announced that borrowers who have defaulted or are delinquent on their loans will get a “fresh start” on their payments once collection resumes. Consequences experienced by borrowers who have defaulted on their student loans include having tax refunds withheld, wage garnishment and diminished Social Security benefits. “During the pause, we will continue our preparations to give borrowers a fresh start and to ensure that all borrowers have access to repayment plans that meet their financial situations and needs,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement. Advocates for those with student debt, who have been pushing the Biden administration to extend the pause for weeks, praised the continuation of the pause but noted that the five-month extension is too short for borrowers and for the Department of Education to get ready to restart collections. “The pause is a temporary measure that should be in service of a long-term fix, or borrowers may be back in the same crunch four months from now,” Abby Shafroth, interim director of the National Consumer Law Center’s Loan Borrower Assistance Project, said in a statement. The announcement of the extension also comes off the back of a rally held in Washington DC on Monday urging Biden to cancel student debt outright. Calls for Biden to cancel student loans have gained momentum over the course of the pandemic. At the end of March, dozens of Democratic lawmakers signed a letter asking Biden to extend the pause until at least the end of the year and “provide meaningful student debt cancellation”. US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who signed the letter, tweeted on Tuesday that extensions could be read as “savvy politics” but still leaves borrowers with instability. “I don’t think those folks understand the panic and disorder it causes people to get so close to these deadlines just to extend the uncertainty,” she tweeted. I think some folks read these extensions as savvy politics, but I don’t think those folks understand the panic and disorder it causes people to get so close to these deadlines just to extend the uncertainty. It doesn’t have the affect people think it does.We should cancel them. https://t.co/ZvkGRwliLT Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, who also signed the letter, said that the extension is “a very good thing” but added that Biden should move forward with broader debt cancellation. “The president should go further and forgive $50,000 in student loans permanently. It’s a huge burden on so many people,” Schumer told reporters on Wednesday. As a candidate for president, Biden supported the idea of cancelling at least $10,000 of student loans per person. Since entering office, Biden has been mum on any plans to cancel student debt. Last month, Biden’s chief of staff Ron Klain suggested that the administration was considering policies that go beyond a pause extension saying: “The question whether or not there’s some executive action on student debt forgiveness when payments resume is a decision we’re going to take before payments resume.”",News/Education,Biden extends pause on federal student loan payments to end of August,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/06/biden-extends-pause-federal-student-loan-payments
4/7/2022,"The identities of Putin’s daughters have never been confirmed by him or the Kremlin and no photographs of them as adults have ever been officially released. Even the number of children Putin has fathered is subject to intense speculation. Officially, Putin has two children, Maria and Katerina, from his marriage to Lyudmila Putina, a former Aeroflot steward whom he divorced in 2013, becoming the first Russian leader to divorce since Peter the Great in 1698. Putin, who has very rarely spoken publicly about his children, responded to questions at his annual press conference in 2015, saying his daughters had not fled the country, as had been speculated. “They live in Russia. They have never been educated anywhere except Russia. I am proud of them; they continue to study and are working,” he said. “My daughters speak three European languages fluently. I never discuss my family with anyone. “They have never been ‘star’ children, they have never got pleasure from the spotlight being directed on them. They just live their own lives.” Putin said his daughters were “taking the first steps in their careers”, and were “not involved in business or politics”. However, both daughters have since launched business ventures. Katerina Tikhonova, 35, the younger daughter, was born in Dresden in 1986 while Putin was working as a KGB spy. Tikhonova, who uses the surname of her maternal grandmother, studied at St Petersburg State University and Moscow State University and has a master’s degree in physics and mathematics. As well as studying, Tikhonova has a passion for Japanese culture and acrobatic rock’n’roll dancing, an athletic form of boogie-woogie. In 2013 she and her dance partner came fifth in the world championships in Switzerland. It was footage from her dance competitions, compared with pictures from the website of Moscow State University, where she works, that helped to first establish that Tikhonova was Putin’s daughter in 2015. Tikhonova married Kirill Shamalov, the younger son of Nikolai Shamalov, a close confidant of Putin and co-owner of Rossiya Bank, which the US government has described as “the personal bank” of top Kremlin officials. Kirill was appointed Gazprom’s chief legal counsel for foreign economic activity in 2002, when he was just 20. The couple were married at a secret three-day ceremony at the exclusive Igora ski resort in 2013, before photos of the event leaked. They divorced in 2018, but details of any financial settlement have not been made public. Less than two years after the wedding, Shamalov was named by Forbes magazine as one of Russia’s youngest billionaires after acquiring a 17% stake in petrochemicals company Sibur from Gennady Timchenko, a Putin ally who was later hit by sanctions. An investigation by Reuters in 2015 estimated that the couple had corporate holdings worth more than $2bn, as well as a luxury £4m beachfront villa in the French resort of Biarritz. The eight-bedroom Alta Mira villa in the Atlantic resort was last month broken into by anti-Putin protesters, who posted a video on social media declaring: “This house was bought with the money stolen by Putin and the Russian mafia.” They said: “Instead of a luxurious retreat for the oligarchs Putin-Shamalov, we decided to organise a place here for rehabilitation and life for the victims of the Putin regime, especially refugees from Ukraine and Russia who have been forced to flee from war, repression and torture prisons. The time when dictators and oligarchs could rob their own countries and live carelessly in villas in Europe is past.” Tikhonova worked in various roles at Moscow State University before, in 2020, she was appointed the head of a new $1.7bn “artificial intelligence issues and intellectual systems” institute at the university. Putin has previously described the Innopraktika center as “one of the most essential tools in the national strategy of developing AI technology”. Her official advisers at the university have included five members of Putin’s inner circle, including two former KGB officers who lived in the same block of flats in which she grew up in Dresden. Putin’s elder daughter, Maria Vorontsova, 36, is a paediatric endocrinologist, studying the effects of hormones on the body. In 2019 Vorontsova, who lives in a penthouse apartment opposite the US embassy in Moscow, gave an interview on Russian state TV revealing plans for a £500m medical venture aimed at helping to cure cancer. Vorontsova married the Russian-born Dutch businessman Jorrit Faassen in 2013, and the couple lived in the penthouse of an exclusive Amsterdam apartment building. In 2014 some Dutch neighbours called for her to be expelled from the country after the downing of MH17 by pro-Russia forces over Ukraine. Recently a group of Amsterdammers appealed to Vorontsova to plead with her father to end the invasion of Ukraine. A sign placed on land owned by the couple reads: “Less than 2,000km from your peaceful piece of free land, your father is decimating an entire free country and its people. It seems your old man is hard to reach and clearly impossible to stop by even his hangmen. But as we all know, fathers and daughters are a different story.” Speculation is rife in Russia that Putin has a third, even more secret, daughter from a years-long affair with Svetlana Krivonogikh, a Russian woman who reportedly grew up in an overcrowded St Petersburg apartment and worked as a cleaner. The Pandora Papers revealed that Krivonogikh, 46, became the owner of the apartment in Monaco through an offshore company that was reportedly created just weeks after she gave birth to a girl, Luzia. The Kremlin has dismissed the suggestion that Luiza is the president’s daughter. Putin has previously said: “I have a private life in which I do not permit interference. It must be respected.”",News/World news,Who are the daughters of Vladimir Putin facing US sanctions?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/who-are-the-daughters-of-vladimir-putin-facing-us-sanctions
4/7/2022,"Erik ten Hag is confident of being offered the position of Manchester United’s next permanent manager following the agreement between the Dutchman’s camp and the club that Steve McClaren should be appointed as his No 2 if the 51-year-old does take over. The Ajax coach has held more talks with United over succeeding Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and is understood to view the club’s willingness to consider McClaren, who Ten Hag worked under at FC Twente for the 2008-9 season,as a positive sign he could be heading to Old Trafford. Although a final deal is yet to be sealed, there would now be surprise from Ten Hag and his advisors if the Ajax coach misses out. From United’s initial five-man shortlist which also included Spain coach, Luis Enrique, Sevilla’s Julen Lopetegui, Chelsea’s Thomas Tuchel and Paris Saint-Germain’s Maurico Pochettino, Ten Hag has emerged as the executive’s clear favourite.At the start of the process Enrique was a particularly admired candidate but after the 51-year-old made it clear he would not leave Spain until after the winter’s World Cup he effectively ruled himself out as United want the new manager in place for the summer transfer window. Tuchel, too, has proved unattainable due to his commitment to Chelsea and though Lopetegui and Pochettino were interviewed, Ten Hag emerged as the first-choice, impressing in discussions led by John Murtough, United’s football director, and overseen by Joel Glazer, the co-chairman. If Ten Hag is appointed and McClaren joins him it will be a return to the club 21 years after for the 60-year-old former England coach was Sir Alex Ferguson’s No 2, from 1999-2001. At the end of his first season at United the club claimed the treble.

4/7/2022,"As the war in Ukraine enters a new phase, Nato countries have been gradually stepping up their supply of weapons to Kyiv. In doing so, western nations are quietly crossing the defensive-only threshold set by leaders at the start of the crisis. But the question remains whether the gradual escalation in arms deliveries can avoid a Russian retaliation and turn the tide on the battlefield, where Moscow is seeking to wage a more conventional military-on-military war in the eastern Donbas. “The issue will be how much the west shifts to offensive weaponry,” said Phil Osborn, a former UK chief of defence intelligence, “and the absolute criticality of ensuring that the supply of critical military kit is maintained and increased.” Ukraine’s military spent the first six weeks of the war trying to pick off invading Russian armoured columns with light infantry using anti-tank bazookas. Poor Russian tactics and Ukrainian determination successfully forced the overstretched attackers to abandon their attacks on Kyiv, and Chernihiv and Sumy in the north-east. But Ukraine now has to deal with Russian forces in the east and south that have made more defensible gains and are better dug in. In the past 24 hours it has emerged that the Czech Republic has sent a dozen Soviet designed T-72 tanks, plus howitzer artillery pieces and BMP-1 armoured vehicles, a significant shift in the direction of supplying “offensive weapons” that western politicians had insisted they were not prepared to do. That by itself is not enough to make more than a dent in the 94 tanks that Ukraine is estimated by researchers at Oryx to have lost in the fighting so far – but there is persistent speculation Poland could spare 100 more, now it has reached a separate agreement on Tuesday to buy 250 US Abrams tanks for $4.75bn. The next phase of the war – which could yet be decisive – is expected to unfold in the Donbas in the next month as Russian forces seek to capture Mariupol, create a land bridge to Crimea, expand the area of occupation in the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk – and perhaps encircle Ukraine’s main fighting force ranged against it. It is a struggle that will unfold over the course of April. Western intelligence officials believe the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will want an “announceable success” for the country’s traditional Victory Day parade on 9 May, placing considerable emphasis on what the west is prepared to supply now. A handful or two of Czech tanks, or the four Bushmaster armoured vehicles sent by Australia, will not make much difference. “If we had already got what we needed – all these planes, tanks, artillery, anti-missile and anti-ship weapons – we could have saved thousands of people,” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said earlier this week. The US announced it would send a further $100m of Javelin anti-tank missiles on Wednesday, on top of $300m of equipment on Friday, which includes two new sets of weapons, designed to help Ukrainian forces better attack the Russians. Friday’s batch included “laser-guided rocket systems” thought by experts to refer to APKWS rockets. These are traditionally mounted on planes – and possibly drones – but can be used on the ground, and could in that instance help counter Russia’s preponderance in heavy artillery, which has caused so many Ukrainian casualties. A second element of Friday’s package was 10 Switchblade 600 combat drones, which have a range of 90km and can fly for 40 minutes, and carry the same anti-tank warhead as the Javelin anti-tank weapon – a replacement for lost Turkish TB2 drones, giving Ukraine more options on the battlefield. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare expert at Rusi, said he believed the Switchblade drones were “an urgent requirement” because they could help “strike Russian command nodes, electronic warfare vehicles, logistics hubs, artillery and air defence systems in depth” – reaching deep behind the frontline in Donbas. The growing supply will certainly help Ukraine fight the second phase of the Russian attack, but it is probably not until the end of April that a clearer picture will emerge of the revised military balance. Without more tanks, in particular, it is not obvious that Ukraine can relieve the besieged Mariupol. Meanwhile, the west’s aims are becoming less clear. Is the goal to allow Ukraine to force the Kremlin into peace talks – or try to inflict a more heavy defeat that would risk provoking an unpredictable Russian president? A western official cautioned on Wednesday that it would be “fundamentally different” to try to force Russian forces out of the separatist republics of Donetsk and Luhansk and Crimea because of “the way in which Russia would defend those interests”.",News/World news,"As Ukraine war enters new phase, can western arms turn the tide?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/as-ukraine-war-enters-new-phase-can-western-arms-turn-the-tide
