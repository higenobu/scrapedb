A Lyft driver on Friday kicked out a woman who entered his car and started making racist remarks, a video that went viral on social media shows. The Lyft driver, who identified himself as James W. Bode, posted the video taken from his dashcam on Facebook. The video, timestamped 10:37 p.m. on Friday night, shows a woman entering Bode's car, with a man following behind her. ""You're like a white guy,"" she says when she enters. ""What's that?"" he asks her. ""You're like a white guy?"" she says. ""You're like a normal guy, like you speak English?"" Bode then can be seen turning around to face her in the video. ""Nah, you can get out of the car,"" he tells her. ""What?"" she asks. ""That's inappropriate,"" Bode says.

5/16/2022,"In a Dallas suburb last week, a whip-cracking 9-year-old white boy came to the front porch of one of his neighbors and banged on their door while demanding to confront a Black child in the home. A Ring camera video of the moment went viral after it was posted to social media. The parents of the Black girl, Carissa Nash and her husband Dee Nash, say they posted the video to highlight how local law enforcement told them the boy is too young to face any criminal penalties. But the boy’s father, Bryan Thomas Brunson, is not, and he later would be arrested for his actions in the aftermath of the incident. “This kid comes to my door with a whip looking for my 9-year-old daughter, then puts a big ass scratch on our Audi,” Carissa wrote of the incident that took place on Thursday, May 12, in Kaufman County Texas. “The police came out and tells us, ‘it’ll work itself out since he moving soon.’” She also communicated what happened when they went to the child’s home. Saying that when her husband returned home, the two of them went to talk to the child and his family “about the damages done” to their vehicle. First, the mom says she could hear the boy’s father tell him to lie and say he is not home, but minutes later the man emerges and “comes to the door with a gun.” “He almost shot himself and his daughter standing behind him,” she wrote. The couple posted a video of their visit to the 9-year-old’s home on YouTube. In the footage, Dee is seen talking to the father, who says the reason why he has a Ruger semi-automatic pistol is because they have had beef before. Dee then attempts to show the man the Ring video of what transpired at their home, but Brunson tells them to leave his property. An argument ensues between the two men in Brunson’s driveway, and the boy’s father places the firearm on the ground. When he picks it up, he accidentally pulls the trigger, and the camera records the sound of a shot. Carissa is heard saying, “y’all is so violent.” The Nashes called the police and were told no charges could be filed on the boy because he was a 9, a year too young to face criminal mischief charges. However, TMZ reports that the Kaufman County Constable Precinct 2 Chief Administrator Jason Johnson, confirmed the bullet almost struck Brunson’s own daughter who was standing behind him. The father reportedly was hit with a felony charge of deadly conduct. The Nashes, who have made multiple somewhat inconsistent social media posts about why the boy was at their door, say it all started because the upset boy claimed he got into a fight with the couple’s 13-year-old son — although another narrative says it was their 9-year-old daughter — while he was coming home from school. The couple contends it would have been impossible for the son to be involved because the two minors attend separate schools. “The kid claimed as he was walking home and was jumped by our son,” Dee Nash said online. “Our son is 13 years old. He gets out of school two hours after the 9-year-old gets out of school. So there’s no way our son could have touched or even seen this 9-year-old kid.” The Nashes also say this is not the first incident they’ve encountered with this same boy, stating the boy has claimed that their son assaulted him before. The father says he has social media posts dating back to 2019 regarding the blond child. Dee and Carissa Nash both took to Instagram with videos offering an account of what precipitated Thursday’s events, saying the white boy and their 9-year-old daughter, Jordan, had tussled earlier that day. “We spoke with a group of kids that walk home with a 9-year-old, as well as my daughter, and the entire group,” the father shared. “The 9-year-old kid was saying rude things to the group of kids.” Carissa Nash said the boy shouted out racial slurs to the other kids. Other Black children allegedly got into an altercation with the child, and he took his skateboard and started hitting the others around him. He struck one girl and her brother beat him up. Carissa said, “There was a brother and he got in there and said, ‘I had to defend my sister. He was hitting my sister.’” The couple claims what happened next was the 9-year-old hit the Nashes’ daughter, Jordan Nash, and she defended herself. The child was furious that the girl was fighting back. To make matters worse, while she was fighting the child, another boy pushed him from the back into some water. When he got up, the first person he saw was Jordan and he viciously attacked her. Jordan came home and told Carissa what the entire ordeal was. While they were talking the boy came to the door. A Ring camera, located on the Nash family’s door, captured the boy approaching their porch and banging on the door. In his hands, he had a whip and he snapped it a couple of times at the door. He waited for someone to answer his frantic address. When Carissa opened the door, she chastised him for causing such a ruckus and disrespecting her home. She is heard on the clip saying, “Little boy, you better get your ass up and off my porch before I call the police, beating on my door like this! I will call the police, you need to leave. Don’t you ever beat on my godd-mn like that. GO!” He pouted as he left the property.",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,"Texas 9-Year-Old Brings a Whip to a Black Family’s Porch to Demand Their Daughter Emerge; Boy’s Father Fumbles with Gun When Confronted, Nearly Shoots His Own Child",https://news.yahoo.com/texas-9-old-brings-whip-183000134.html
5/16/2022,"If Roe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court, Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts wants to ban abortion in his state, and he wants that ban to apply to victims of rape. CNN’s State of the Union host Dana Bash asked the governor about a recent effort he supported to pass a “trigger” abortion ban that would go into effect immediately if the Supreme Court rules to overturn abortion rights, which appears to be imminent considering the recently leaked Supreme Court draft opinion.

Gov. Pete Ricketts: ""Those are babies, too."" Bash: ""Including in the case of rape or incest?"" Ricketts: ""Yes, they’re still babies."" pic.twitter.com/iFdofhhmve — Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) May 15, 2022 “Nebraska, your state, does not have a so-called trigger law on the books. But there was an effort, as you know, to pass one,” Bash said in a Sunday interview with Ricketts. “It failed by only two votes last month. The abortion ban that you tried to pass did not include any exceptions for rape or incest.” The host then asked, “Do you think that the state of Nebraska should require a young girl who was raped to carry that pregnancy to term?” Ricketts replied, “So, Nebraska is a pro-life state. I believe life begins at conception. And those are babies too. So, if Roe vs. Wade, which was a horrible constitutional decision, gets overturned by the Supreme Court, which we’re hopeful of, here in Nebraska, we’re going to take further steps to protect those pre-born babies.” “Including in the case of rape or incest?” Bash clarified. “They’re still babies too. Yes, they’re still babies,” the Republican replied. Bash next asked the governor if he would call a special session of the Nebraska legislature to impose an abortion ban following a Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe, Ricketts said, “That would certainly be my intention.” Ricketts joins fellow Republican Governor Tate Reeves of Mississippi in callously defending abortion laws without certain exemptions. Last week, Reeves defended Mississippi’s trigger law that would force victims of incest to have their assailant’s child if they become pregnant. Even abortion bans with rape and incest exceptions are dangerous to pregnant people. Although a person may be eligible for an exception in a state where the law includes such allowances, it is still often extremely difficult or impossible for them to obtain an abortion because those laws can contain requirements, like mandating a rape victim file a police report in order to qualify. “These exceptions don’t do the job that people think they’re going to do,” Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute, told The Atlantic. Abortion bans without exceptions are becoming increasingly popular in the U.S. At least ten states — including Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma — have passed abortion bans lacking exceptions for rape, incest, or both. While most of those laws have been blocked by courts, they could go into effect in the very likely event that Roe is overturned.
