12/20/2021,"A former manager of a Papa John's location Colorado says he was fired after 13 years with the brand. He was let go a day after he closed the restaurant three hours early due to a scheduling conflict. His post describing the situation on Reddit's ""antiwork"" message board went viral before it was removed. The former general manager of a Papa John's franchise location in Colorado was fired this week after scheduling conflicts led him to close the restaurant three hours early on Tuesday evening. Chris Jackson told Insider he has been with Papa John's for more than 13 years and had been working long stretches of back-to-back open-to-close shifts for the pizza chain due to difficulty with hiring and retaining staff during the pandemic. In a Reddit post to the fast-growing r/antiwork community, Jackson explained that on Monday, the Tuesday evening shift leader told him they had a medical appointment and couldn't cover the shift. Jackson said he too had a family medical obligation at that time and asked his area manager for coverage. On Tuesday afternoon, Jackson was told that no one was coming to cover the shift, so he closed the restaurant at 5pm. The next morning he was fired. ""I hadn't had any issues at all, that's why I was confused,"" he told Insider. ""This is the only incident that ever happened."" Jackson's Reddit post racked up over 6,600 upvotes and 650 comments on Friday, but was removed by moderators for violating the platform's ban on sharing confidential or personal information. Insider spoke with Jackson, who provided screenshots of text messages and emails that were consistent with his story, including a company form that said he was fired. ""Chris closed the restaurant without approval,"" the form reads. ""Closing a restaurant without approval is cause for immediate termination of employment."" Colorado is an at-will state, where employees may be fired at any time, for any reason, or no reason at all. A spokesperson for Papa John's told Insider that franchisees typically handle their own hiring and firing procedures without corporate involvement, and that he did not want to speculate without a more detailed knowledge of the situation. The franchise owner did not respond to Insider's request for comment. As a salaried manager, Jackson says he was responsible for covering far more than full-time hours for no additional pay. ""If I worked 50 hours or 60 hours, it didn't matter in the pay at all."" he said. Jackson said he was able to agree to a weekly cap of 55 hours on his own schedule, but he was not authorized to offer a wage or salary high enough to attract and retain workers and managers for his restaurant. ""They'll just be like, ""This is the top line where we can pay,'"" he said. ""And you know, it's expensive. It's like, it's really expensive here.""

12/20/2021,"Donald Trump Jr. started a chant of ""let's go, Brandon"" at a weekend conference hosted by the conservative organization Turning Point USA on Sunday. Full video of Trump's speech was not immediately available, but Newsmax journalist Benny Johnson shared a clip on his Twitter account: The four-day event, known as AmericaFest, is being held in Phoenix, Arizona, and also features speeches from Charlie Kirk, Sarah Palin, Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene (R-Ga.), Tucker Carlson, and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.). ""How about a 'Let's go, Brandon'?"" Trump said as he took the stage. The crowd obliged. After about 30 seconds of chanting, Trump added, ""You know there's another way to say that, but I will not condone that kind of behavior from you fine, young individuals."" ""Let's go, Brandon"" became a euphemism for ""F--k Joe Biden"" after a sportscaster mistook the latter for the former at an October NASCAR race. In his speech, Trump criticized progressive attempts to promote gender equity and transgender inclusion, The Independent reports. ""Just like when they talk about the breakdown of the labor force between men and women. Why don't they ever talk about that there's a grossly underrepresented portion of ... female bricklayers,"" he said, adding sarcastically ""I think that's a disgrace."" He also claimed China is ""laughing"" at the U.S. over attempts by the U.S. Air Force to ""make sure you have plenty of transgender pilots."" The Air Force announced in April that it would be implementing new policies to ensure equitable treatment for airmen who have undergone a gender transition or are in the process of transitioning. He went on to criticize his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, for allowing transgender swimmer Lia Thomas — who recently won a race by an unheard-of 38 seconds, according to the Daily Mail — to compete on the women's team. It's unrealistic to ban football. But it might not be ethical to watch it, either.

12/20/2021,"An El Cajon jury acquitted a former La Mesa police officer of charges that he filed a false report after a controversial arrest of a young Black man in 2020. The jury deliberated only one day before returning with the not-guilty verdict on Friday, Dec. 10,. While the ex-cop’s lawyers say that he is feeling relief, the San Diego NAACP is feeling something completely different: “disappointment.” The civil rights organization released a statement on its website expressing displeasure over the verdict. It read in part, “The NAACP San Diego Branch is disappointed with the not guilty verdict returned by the jury in the case of former La Mesa police officer Matthew Dages. The Branch believes there was more than enough evidence to convict this former police officer. The justice system failed in this case.” Signed by the chapter’s First Vice President Brian Bonner, the note focused on the viral video that showed Dages harassing Amaurie Johnson while he waited for his friends in front of their apartment building. “After a video of a violent arrest of a young black male by a La Mesa police officer became public, public protests, a review by the La Mesa Police Department and the San Diego County district attorney led to charges against former officer Matthew Dages for lying on his arrest report,” the statement continued. The organization also maintains that the “lack of diversity” of the jury played a major part in the outcome of the case, “In spite of the strong evidence presented by the District Attorney, this jury, which as we previously noted lacked diversity and perhaps even interest in the case, returned a not guilty verdict. While we respect and have confidence in the jury system as a whole, the NAACP San Diego branch strongly disagrees with this not guilty verdict. This case demonstrates that the fight for justice must continue.” The NAACP isn’t the only organization that takes issue with the decision. Yusef Miller of the Racial Justice Coalition, balked at the acquittal. “It’s obvious that this man [Johnson] — innocent of any crime, any violation — was targeted, and that’s what started this thing snowballing out of control,” said Miller. On May 27, 2020, the then 23-year-old Johnson was approached by Dages, who was serving on a “fare compliance operation” for the department. Though the assignment required him to check to see if people had the correct fare to ride the trolley, he approached the young man who was across the street from the Grossmont Transit Center in front of the apartments. The officer accused Johnson of smoking, even though he was not. He was talking on his cell phone. Police reports would later confirm that Johnson had no “smoking paraphernalia” on his person and that Dages was mistaken. The incident, captured by several cameras, escalated quickly, eventually leading to Johnson being arrested. Johnson was not charged for smoking in a “no-smoking” zone. He was arrested for assaulting an officer and resisting arrest. Though smoking was why Dages initially approached Johnson, in his police report, he failed to mention that at all. He was later fired for misrepresenting the facts of the arrest. The now-retired Police Chief Walt Vasquez who terminated Dages says that his report of the incident reflected racial bias and that he believed the officer profiled Johnson because he was Black. Misrepresenting the facts in a report as an officer is a crime under the CA Penal Code § 118.1 and Dages faced up to three years in prison had he been convicted. His acquittal freed him from this possibility. “I think our client is relieved,” Dages’ attorney Joshua Visco shared. “It’s been a very, very long journey for him, and his family and his supporters — of which he has a lot.” Visco further stated that he believed that his client was a victim of a “political prosecution,” Fox 5 reports. He stated, “A ‘not guilty’ verdict shows that the DA should have never prosecuted this case in the first place.” San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan disagrees, standing firm on the American principle of due process. “While I respect the jury’s verdict, I remain proud that my team courageously fought for justice without prejudice against or favor towards anyone,” he said in a statement. “The integrity of our criminal justice system depends on police officers filing truthful police reports and our thorough review of the facts and evidence led us to bring the charge and present the case to the jury.” He concluded, “The community can take comfort in knowing that the vast majority of police officers in our county serve with honor and uphold the law while doing the difficult job of keeping our communities safe.” More news from our partners: ‘How Is This Deescalating?’: Bystanders Outraged After Viral Video Shows Minneapolis Police Officer Violently Arresting Elderly Black Man “Death Appears To Be Part Of A Disturbing Trend” | Ex-NFL Player Glenn Foster Choked Before Dying In An Alabama Sheriff’s Department Custody Pandemic Pivot: Entrepreneur Turns His Nightclub Into Houston’s First Black-Owned Grocer Featuring Black Brands",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,"Despite Video Evidence, Ex La Mesa Cop Charged with Lying In a Police Report About the Arrest of a Black Man That Went Viral Acquitted by Jury",https://news.yahoo.com/despite-video-evidence-ex-la-173000319.html
