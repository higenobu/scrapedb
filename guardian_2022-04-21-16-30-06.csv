4/21/2022,"Near one of the oldest and most beautiful squares in Kyiv, Sofiivska, I met Andriy Khlyvnyuk – a famous Ukrainian singer who recently joined the police civil defence. I wrote about him during the first days of the war. The video of him singing the century-old march Oh, the Red Viburnum in the Meadow went viral. Pink Floyd collaborated with Khlyvnyuk and issued their version of the track, Hey Hey Rise Up, in support of Ukraine. At the start of the war, the streets of Ukrainian cities emptied. So when strangers meet now they say hello, and when you come across someone you know, even a distant acquaintance, you hug each other. I told Khlyvnyuk I’d just come from Donbas, and had a feeling of irreversible tragedy lying ahead in anticipation of possibly the biggest battle of the war. “How are you holding yourself together?” Andriy asked me. “I’m not thinking too hard,” I told him. “I just focus on what I should do next.” “The same with me,” he said. This is the case with most of my friends and the people I meet. A few days after the liberation of Bucha, I walked through the most damaged street – Vokzalna. According to the Ukrainian authorities, at least 400 people were killed there during the Russian occupation. Bucha is a suburban town near Kyiv, where middle-class professionals prefer to buy affordable flats and houses since there are more kindergartens and fresh air. Among the wreckage of burnt tanks, Ihor and Volodya – workers in a communication company – were repairing fibre cables to restore internet connections in the town. Metres away, rescue workers were de-mining the area. In the neighbouring town of Irpin, which was heavily shelled, the mayor asked residents to help clean up the debris. He needed 300 volunteers; 1,500 signed up at once, and within days almost 10,000 had joined the clean-up effort. I take photographs of every house I see. First, I photograph all the houses that have not been destroyed – these are the majority. I post these photos so people who have managed to escape can check whether their homes survived. For a brief moment, I feel I have come to these areas not just to provide a grim account of horrors, but to give hope that their towns have survived, that there is a place to go back to. Travelling between liberated villages and towns around Kyiv to document evidence of crimes – something I see it as part of my job to do – has become hard. Many bridges were bombed and roads are being cleared, so traffic jams are enormous. People are now coming back en masse. But the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has asked residents to wait. Air raid sirens are still sounding, though we hear them less often. The full-scale assault on the capital may resume. Oleksandr Gruzevych, deputy chief of staff of land forces and the general in charge of the defence of Kyiv, says it doesn’t matter how the battle in Donbas goes: the Ukrainian capital will remain a key target for Russia. Others are concerned that after the sinking of the Moskva battleship, the Kremlin is keen for revenge and will consider another attack on Kyiv. Nevertheless, there is a feeling of victory. So far Kyiv has been saved not because of Putin’s mercy but because of the capital’s air defences, the best in the country. The Russians’ retreat was not a goodwill gesture; they withdrew because they failed to conquer the capital. Some checkpoints in the streets of Kyiv are now being removed to allow traffic to flow more freely. A beauty parlour near my house sends a message: “We’re open again.” A plumber is ready to come to my friend’s flat as soon as tomorrow. Pupils attend online lessons in schools. The overnight curfew starts later – 10pm, not 7pm as it was in the first days of war. This allows residents to commute to work, and essential shops and businesses have reopened. A few restaurants are open again too. I am not ready to go to restaurants yet, and opt for a supermarket instead. Eating out, having a good time, doesn’t feel right. Many Kyiv residents feel survivor’s guilt. The city authorities say 228 сivilians, among them four children, were killed in Kyiv, and almost 400 people wounded. Still, the level of destruction cannot be compared to Kharkiv or Mariupol. Moreover, in nearby towns such as Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel, many residents paid the highest price possible for not letting Russians in. They were tortured, robbed, murdered. Many houses were burned. Coming back to Bucha a few days ago with a group of foreign journalists who wanted to see destroyed Russian tanks, we couldn’t find any, and even Vokzalna street is now open to vehicles. Houses have been destroyed by shelling, yet it’s not obvious that a fierce battle took place here. The journalists looked disappointed. For us it’s still the place we live, though cleaning up doesn’t mean erasing the memory of what happened here. Ukrainians are resilient because we know how to switch to survival mode very fast. That’s our history. You do what you have to do, because you might not get another chance. Oddly enough, it’s me who calms down western friends and colleagues who complain that they feel powerless. Here in Ukraine we do not feel powerless. We do something practical to defend ourselves all the time. My major criticism of western intelligence analysts, who were correct about Putin’s war, is that, among the often dire scenarios they outline, the one in which Ukraine wins is rarely mentioned. These days the most popular image in Ukraine is the photograph of a kitchen cabinet that stands untouched on the wall of a bombed-out building in the town of Borodyanka, near Kyiv. “If a kitchen cabinet holds up,” people say, “we definitely can.” Nataliya Gumenyuk is a Ukrainian journalist specialising in foreign affairs and conflict reporting, and author of Lost Island: Tales from the Occupied Crimea (2020)",Opinion/Opinion,We forced the Russians back from Kyiv.

4/21/2022,"In a famous experiment from the late 1920s, IA Richards set his Cambridge students the task of reading a series of short, anonymous literary extracts. They were asked to pay minute attention to rhythm, sound, tone, texture and syntax before attempting to date each text. Richards conceived this Practical Criticism, as the methodology came to be called, as a tough-minded challenge to what had hitherto passed as literary criticism. In the prewar period, university professors were apt to make vague aesthetic judgments about a book’s “beauty” or “soul” before lobbing in a few comments about the author’s mother or the publishing practices of the time. Richards’s students, by contrast, were asked to exclude all such background blather in favour of what they could deduce from the words on the page. In this exhilarating book, Terry Eagleton describes the sea change in literary criticism that occurred between the two world wars. The five intellectuals he concentrates on here are inevitably male – as well as Richards, there is TS Eliot, William Empson, FR Leavis and Raymond Williams – since Cambridge, the university with which they were all connected, was not particularly welcoming to female academics. Or, indeed, to anyone at all: most of the time these men appeared to dislike each other intensely and enjoyed saying so. Indeed, Eagleton’s great achievement here is to look beyond the scrim of five tricky personalities to identify the continuities in their work, which added up to a revolution in the way that people – not just professional academics, but the whole community of readers throughout the English-speaking world – thought and talked about books. Richards’s experiments in practical criticism revealed that most of his students had a tin ear for nuance. It wasn’t unusual for them to misidentify a slipshod bit of Victorian sentiment as a passage from one of the scalpel-sharp metaphysical poets of the 17th century. Richards’s intention was not to humiliate his students but to point to the way in which their critical faculties had been dulled by the onslaught of modern mass media, especially journalism and cinema. These were the very discourses that TS Eliot had so brilliantly pastiched in The Waste Land (1922), his dissonant verse sequence, which Richards had influentially welcomed as a “music of ideas”. Not all Richards’s original close-readers were duffers. The cleverest was William Empson, whose brilliant Seven Types of Ambiguity (1930) was written when he was just 22. Here, Empson’s earlier training as a mathematician becomes apparent as he teases out linguistic puzzles in the work of his favourite poets – including Shakespeare and Keats – in a way that multiplies the meanings available to the alert reader. Empson’s rigorous methodology was exported to the US, where it became the cornerstone of the hugely influential if somewhat chilly New Criticism. Another of Richards’s original guinea pigs took a very different line. FR Leavis declared reading to be an intensely moral act and famously spent much of his time deciding which authors did and did not deserve to be a member of the Great Tradition, best understood as his own personal fantasy football team of English literature. Dickens was out at first but then he was grudgingly allowed in. Jane Austen, George Eliot and Joseph Conrad were all picked for the first team. The captaincy, though, was reserved for DH Lawrence, whose work Leavis simply adored. At which point Eagleton cannot help but raise a quizzical eyebrow given the ample evidence of antisemitism, totalitarianism and misogyny at work in Lawrence’s life and writing. It would be hard to think of any writer better able to lay out the dust-ups and love-ins of interwar literary culture than Terry Eagleton. His own critical interventions have always been distinguished by an exemplary clarity, not to mention a generous humour. Here, for instance, he shows us the riotously promiscuous William Empson trying to get off a charge for importuning his taxi driver in Tokyo by claiming that he found it hard to tell Japanese men and women apart. Or TS Eliot, begetter of the hugely influential Tradition and the Individual Talent, whose favourite conversational topic was the various routes of London buses. IA Richards, meanwhile, may have been a whiz at practical criticism but he was also a quick-thinking man of action, once repelling a bear in the Canadian Rockies by urinating on it. Eagleton’s goal here is not to mock or diminish. His respect for these thinkers, in whose tradition he is perhaps the last member (he was taught by Raymond Williams, the youngest of the Cambridge group) shimmers gratefully and lovingly on the page.
