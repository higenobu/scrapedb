3/11/2022,"Northern Territory police officer Zachary Rolfe has been found not guilty of murder in relation to the shooting death of Kumanjayi Walker. Rolfe, 30, was also cleared of two alternative charges of manslaughter and engaging in a violent act causing death. The verdict comes after an almost five-week trial in the supreme court, and after the case was delayed multiple times because of legal argument and the pandemic. The trial heard Rolfe shot Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, while trying to arrest him in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs, on 9 November 2019. Walker stabbed Rolfe with scissors prior to the first shot being fired. This shot was not subject to any charges. But, the court heard, 2.6 seconds after the first shot, Rolfe fired again, and then 0.5 seconds later he fired a third time. These final two shots were fired from close range at a time when Rolfe’s partner, then constable Adam Eberl, was attempting to restrain Walker on a mattress. The prosecution alleged Walker no longer posed a threat to Rolfe or Eberl by that stage. Rolfe defended the charges on the grounds he feared for the life of Eberl and was acting in good faith and “the reasonable performance of his duties” when he fired the final two shots. “When Kumanjayi Walker deliberately and … viciously tried to stab both officers with potentially fatal consequences,” Rolfe’s barrister David Edwardson QC told the jury in his closing address. “The only appropriate response was to draw his firearm and pull the trigger, discharging each bullet into … Walker until the threat was removed.” Rolfe had given evidence in his own case, telling the court he believed Walker was trying to stab Eberl at the time of the shots, and Edwardson said the prosecution “did not land a glove on him”. Prosecutor Philip Strickland SC accused Rolfe of lying in the witness stand about crucial parts of his evidence, saying that Walker never put his hand on Rolfe’s gun, nor had Rolfe seen Walker stabbing Eberl. In his closing address, Strickland said the jury should consider the context to Rolfe confronting Walker in the Yuendumu property known as House 511 where the shooting occurred. This context, Strickland said, included what he alleged was Rolfe’s “preoccupation” with an incident three days earlier, when Walker threatened two police officers with an axe at a separate Yuendumu property known as House 577, Rolfe’s “keenness” to be deployed to Yuendumu, his “insistence” upon leaving the Yuendumu police station to immediately track down Walker, and the “manner” and “state of readiness” in which he searched House 577 minutes before the shooting. “All of those matters, we say, are evidence of a particular state of mind,” Strickland said. “They’re all evidence of a mentality the accused had at that time and that mentality was that if Kumanjayi Walker showed any resistance, if he presented with an edged weapon, he would be prepared to draw his weapon, and if necessary fire it at Kumanjayi Walker.” Strickland claimed that Rolfe had lied to the court to “justify the unjustifiable”. The defence said that was “absurd”.

3/11/2022,"After months of absence, Chiang Mai’s waterfalls, night markets and hostels are once again filling up with a familiar sight: backpackers. While Thailand was once a haven for budget travellers, Covid-19 devastated the tourism industry, which is only now starting to take tentative steps towards reopening. People familiar with Chiang Mai at its tourism peak will still find the city relatively quiet, but those in the travel industry are seeing glimmers of hope after two years of despair. “We can see the number slowly increase,” said Palakorn Viriya, owner of Deejai Backpackers hostel. Speaking to the Guardian from the hostel lobby, he described the previous two years as a “struggle”. Palakorn said before Covid, he usually had 40-60 guests every night, but now he gets about 10 each night. Still, this is a marked improvement from 2020 and 2021. “The last customer left the hostel in July 2020 and then there was nothing until November 2021,” when Thailand eased entry restrictions for vaccinated visitors, he said. Palakorn says he was lucky because he owns the property outright but estimates as many as 80% of his competitors were forced to close down, mostly because they couldn’t afford rent with no customers. “Now the customer is more than last year but still not really that much if compared before Covid,” said a Thai tour guide and driver who goes by the English name Vincent. Vincent said before Covid hit, he had customers every single day, but now he only has customers two or three times a week, and many are still domestic travellers. During peak Covid waves, he had no customers at all and was forced to go back to working at his family’s rice mill. According to data from the country’s tourism ministry, nearly 204,000 tourists arrived in Thailand in the month of February. January arrivals slumped to 134,000 due to an Omicron wave, while December saw about 230,000. The previous 11 months combined saw less than 200,000. But the recent uptick still pales in comparison to the 39.8 million international tourists that graced Thailand’s beaches, mountains and cities in 2019 before the pandemic, contributing 21.9% of Thailand’s total GDP. Still, Palakorn and Vincent both believe the industry has rounded the corner. “I can see the town is getting busier,” Palakorn said. “I think the tourist situation will absolutely improve in next year,” said Vincent. Deejai hosted a pool party on 6 March, its first event in two years, and Palakorn says there will be more to come, although there are still complications. He estimates that about 250 people attended, a “successful” turnout. All attendees were given rapid tests before being admitted, with two people testing positive and getting sent home. Israeli tourist Or walked down the street in Chiang Mai’s old city, wearing a tell-tale backpack half his size. He politely declined persistent offers for a ride from tuk-tuk drivers, incredulous that he would walk in the blazing heat. The 22-year-old was taking time off to travel after compulsory military service, a common tradition in Israel. He arrived in Thailand in mid-February, after a few months in India. “In Thailand I was shocked because in comparison to India there was a large amount of tourists,” he said. He said the highlight of his trip so far was a motorbike ride to a monk’s village in the Chiang Mai mountains. He also planned to go to a traditional Thai cooking class, a very popular tourist attraction in Chiang Mai. “I find in Chiang Mai they love cuisine and food and I want to experience more of this,” he said. But constantly changing regulations and onerous requirements may be keeping some tourists at bay. In Thailand, fully vaccinated travellers must apply online for a Thai Pass before entering, which requires vaccination, health insurance, flight bookings, and a pre-booked hotel and PCR test for the first night. This costs hundreds of dollars, which must be spent before the traveler has even been approved to enter. Some tourism experts have urged Thailand to scrap the Thai Pass and the first-night quarantine. “Thailand is at a crossroads now. There’s no choice but to open up and get rid of Test & Go,” said Thailand Hotels Association president Marisa Sukosol earlier this month. In neighbouring Cambodia, fully vaccinated tourists simply need to take a rapid test on arrival and are free to go if it comes back negative. Or is planning to visit Cambodia next, and said the process was “way easier”. Palakorn would like to see Thailand’s policies change as well, or risk losing budget travellers to countries like Cambodia. “I want to see, when you arrive at the airport you just show your vaccine and that’s it,” he said.",News/World news,Backpackers’ return brings glimmer of hope for Thailand tourism revival,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/backpackers-return-brings-glimmer-of-hope-for-thailand-tourism-revival
