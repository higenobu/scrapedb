4/14/2022,"Moscow has shifted its focus in its war against Kyiv after nearly 50 days of fighting with a senior U.S. defense official reporting Wednesday that all of Russia’s ground forces have now entered Ukraine’s eastern flank. Security officials have been sounding the alarm that the Kremlin’s inability to take the capital city of Kyiv meant it would launch a major offensive in eastern Ukraine. 
US BACKS OUT OF SENDING MI-17 HELICOPTERS TO UKRAINE AS PART OF $750M PACKAGE Russia launched its second convoy this week and ground forces are flooding across Ukraine’s northern border into the Lunhask region, the official said. ""I think you’d go so far as to say all their ground forces are either in the Donbas – Luhank Oblast or the Donetsk Oblast – and then in the south arrayed all the way from Mariupol down to Mykolaiv,"" the official added. Defense officials have warned that Russia’s determination to continue with its ""special military operation"" in a concentrated location like the Donbas, will mean an even more brutal fight ahead. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy mocked Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion Wednesday, questioning how many will need to die before he gives up. ""Do you remember how Russia bragged that they would seize Kyiv in 48 hours? Instead, Ukraine has been repelling the enemy for 48 days,"" he said in an address to the nation. 
KHARKIV HIT WITH 53 STRIKES IN 24 HOURS, DOZENS INJURED AS RUSSIAN CONVOY PUSHES SOUTH ""They say they do everything for the sake of the people, for the sake of Donbas, but even during World War II, Donbas did not see such cruelty in such a short time,"" he continued. ""In Donbas, the story of the siege of Leningrad was repeated. What would the people who died or almost died in Leningrad during the Nazi blockade say about this? What would they say about the blockade of Mariupol?"" Zelenskyy said this week that Ukrainian forces were not getting what they needed from allies to quickly end the war before it escalates even more in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian president again urged the U.S. and NATO to send warplanes so that his troops could remove the weeks-long blockade on Mariupol and help repel more invading Russian forces from taking a greater hold in the region. The U.S. has provided more than 1.7 billion in security assistance since the invasion began but has refused to provide jets over fears it could direct Russian aggression toward NATO nations across Ukraine’s borders. The Biden administration is expected to announce another round of security aid this week.",World/Fox News,All Russian ground forces have entered Ukraine's eastern flank: senior US defense official,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-ground-forces-entered-ukraine-172227087.html
4/14/2022,"Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on Wednesday said that federal agencies should immediately cut ties with management consulting firm McKinsey & Company amid reports of the firm allowing its employees to consult for government agencies. “McKinsey & Company’s entire business model is to profit from undisclosed conflicts of interest,” Rubio said in a statement. Rubio also cited the company’s relationship with the Chinese Communist Party, China’s leading government power, saying the party poses an “existential threat to our nation.” “We know the company has been doing this with opioid producers and federal regulators, which underscores the massive danger posed by McKinsey’s work for both the Chinese Communist Party and vast segments of America’s national security infrastructure. The Chinese Communist Party poses an existential threat to our nation, and McKinsey cannot be trusted. Every federal agency should immediately cut ties with the company.” Rubio’s latest statement comes following a report from The New York Times detailing thousands of internal documents that showed the firm allowed its employees who consulted for pharmaceutical companies to also advise government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In a letter sent to McKinsey’s Global Managing Partner Bob Sternfels, Rubio wrote that his company has repeatedly lied to his staff about the company’s relationship with the Chinese government. “McKinsey’s refusal to answer those questions takes on new importance given reports that ‘a McKinsey consultant highlighted the firm’s work for the F.D.A. and stressed “who we know and what we know,”’” Rubio said in his statement. “Previous reports make clear that McKinsey’s “work with both the Pentagon and powerful Chinese state-owned enterprises poses a potential risk to national security that federal agencies can no longer ignore.” For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.",Business/The Hill,Rubio: Federal agencies should immediately cut ties with McKinsey,https://news.yahoo.com/rubio-federal-agencies-immediately-cut-174208017.html
