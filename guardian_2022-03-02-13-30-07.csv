3/2/2022,"Joe Biden denounced Russian “tyranny” in his first State of the Union speech, but also carved plenty of time time to make his pitch for Democrats as the US midterm elections loom. The president, who is struggling with a low approval rating and faces the prospect of Democrats losing control of the House and the Senate in the November, condemned Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. He announced a flight ban on Russian aircraft, before turning to the domestic policies Biden hopes will make voters choose him. Biden pointed to his administration’s success in the fight against Covid 19, and said America was moving towards “more normal routines”, but could not completely cover up the failure of his signature piece of legislation, the $2tn Build Back Better act. Here are some key takeaways from the speech: As expected, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine played a prominent role in Biden’s speech, as the president condemned Putin in the strongest terms yet. “Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways,” Biden said. “He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. He met the Ukrainian people.” Traditionally, State of the Union speeches focus on a president’s domestic achievements and agenda, but Biden was forced to adapt the address, and he spent the first third of his speech addressing the war in Ukraine. Biden outlined the efforts the US and other countries have taken against Russia, including the flight ban announced on Tuesday night, as he reiterated that US troops “will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine”. Putin “thought he could divide us here at home”, and said the Russian leader had believed Nato and the west “wouldn’t respond”. “Putin was wrong. We were ready,” Biden said. There was a warning, however, that the US will feel the impact of the conflict. “A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world,” Biden said. He said the US had worked with other countries to release 60m barrels of oil from reserves, which he said would “help blunt gas prices here at home”. “I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming,” Biden said. “But I want you to know that we are going to be OK.” “Tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia,” Biden said. He stressed that the move was not merely symbolic, but would add “an additional squeeze on their economy”. “Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run,” Biden said. The airspace ban will further cement Russia’s pariah status. A number of European countries, including France, Germany, Spain, Poland and the UK have already banned Russian aircraft and airlines from their airspace. Russia reacted by ordering those countries not to enter Russian airspace. American, Delta and United have all halted flights over Russia. Biden devoted significant time to his efforts to combat US inflation, which is currently at its highest rate in 40 years. It was part of an attempt to reassure Americans on the economy, the key factor in coming midterm elections that Democrats are expected to lose. Biden laid out a plan to combat the rise, but his $2tn Build Back Better agenda was conspicuous by its absence. The legislation was to be a key component of his first term, but is loathed by Republicans and was ultimately torpedoed by Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat who renewed his criticism of Biden almost immediately after the president finished speaking. Still, Biden proposed some measures that were in that bill, including cutting the price of prescription drugs, reducing energy costs for families, providing affordable childcare, and raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest Americans. His “plan to fight inflation”, Biden said, “will lower your costs and lower the deficit.” But past presidents have mostly failed in their attempts to combat inflation, which is mostly a task for the Federal Reserve. Biden seemed to accept there were limitations to what he can actually do, with part of his pitch sounding almost like a plea to big business. “Lower your costs, not your wages,” Biden said. “I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted,” Biden said, as he moved to discuss efforts to tackle the pandemic. “But I also know this. Because of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.” Biden referenced new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which said people in many parts of the US can now go mask-free in most indoor and outdoor spaces. “Based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks,” Biden said. He also announced that more free tests will be made available to Americans starting next week. Biden also acknowledged the polarized response to the pandemic – typified by the number of Republicans in the House and Senate who railed against mask wearing, vaccine mandates and school closures – but asked that Americans “use this moment to reset”. “Let’s stop looking at Covid as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: a God-awful disease. Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: fellow Americans,” Biden said. Black Lives Matter demonstrations, inspired by the police killing of George Floyd, saw tens of thousands of Americans take to the streets in the summer of 2020. The protests sparked political discussion of serious police reform, sometimes under the banner of the “Defund the police” movement, but Biden came out firmly against that on Tuesday. “I know what works: investing in crime prevention and community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety,” Biden said. “We should all agree: the answer is not to defund the police. The answer is to fund the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities.” With a rise in violent crime in many US cities, policing and crime is expected to be a key issue in the midterm elections, and Biden appeared to be taking a line he hopes will appeal to the voters he won away from an increasingly radical Republican party in 2020. But the unqualified praise of police will likely come as a blow to progressive Democrats, who have called for serious restructuring of police departments to combat continuing police violence, particularly against people of color. Progressives would like to see money redirected from police to mental health services and community resources, but Biden took the opposite tack.",News/US news,State of the Union takeaways: Biden talks tough on Putin and touts Covid progress,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/state-of-the-union-takeaways-biden-putin-coronavirus
3/2/2022,"Ukraine’s besieged cities have come under more heavy bombardment after Russian commanders facing fierce resistance intensified their shelling of urban areas. As US president Joe Biden warned Vladimir Putin that he would “pay a price” for his aggression, the Russia leader’s forces have shown no sign of stopping an assault that has included strikes on the capital Kyiv and rocket attacks in the second city of Kharkiv, resulting in the deaths of dozens of people. Ukrainian security chiefs said on Wednesday morning that Russian paratroopers had landed in Kharkiv and engaged in heavy fighting with Ukrainian forces. In a ringing attack on Putin in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, Biden told the massed members of US Congress in Washington that the invasion of Ukraine had left Russia “weaker, and the rest of the world stronger.” “Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson – when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos. They keep moving. And, the costs and threats to America and the world keep rising. “Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.” Biden announced he was banning Russian flights from US airspace from Wednesday. Ukraine’s ambassador to the US got a standing ovation at the start of the address, as Biden called on the House to show the world that the United States of America stands with Ukraine. Facing emboldened Ukrainian troops bolstered by citizen soldiers, Russia has failed to capture a single city since its full-scale invasion began nearly a week ago. Western analysts say Russia has resorted to the bombing of built-up areas before entering them. Moscow’s strategy in Chechnya and Syria was to use artillery and air bombardments to pulverize cities and crush fighters’ resolve. The UK Ministry of Defence said on Tuesday night that it believed the second city of Kharkiv was “likely encircled” by Russian forces, along with Kherson on the Black Sea, and the strategically important Sea of Azov port city, Mariupol. In other developments: Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled the fighting as a miles-long Russian military convoy north of Kyiv advances toward the city. West of Kyiv, in the city of Zhytomyr, four people, including a child, were killed on Tuesday by a Russian cruise missile, a Ukrainian official said. A Russian military strike in the small town of Borodjanka north-west of Kyiv on Tuesday night tore through two apartment blocks, videos on social media and confirmed by multiple news sources show. Russian troops in Kharkiv attacked a military hospital, according to the Security Service of Ukraine. Despite the buildup of forces outside the capital, a US defence official said on Tuesday night that Russia’s move on Kyiv had stalled as its forces struggle with basic logistics challenges, including shortages of food and fuel. Some units appeared to be gripped by low morale, the official said. In addition, commanders may be considering more bombardment instead of using the kind of armoured thrusts that characterised the first few days of the war, a US military thinktank said on Tuesday. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said on Tuesday that the Kremlin was preparing to cut off a large part of Ukraine from the internet and communications in an effort to break local resistance. In a highly emotional address to the European parliament on Tuesday that was greeted with a standing ovation, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said at least 16 children had been killed on Monday and mocked Russia’s claim that it was going after only military targets. “Where are these children, what kind of military factories do they work at? What tanks are they going at, launching cruise missiles?” “We resist the invasive aggression,” Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter late on Tuesday, after thanking western leaders for their support. “Today, more than ever, it is important for us to feel that we are not alone.” The United Nations says at least 136 civilians have been killed in the invasion, but that the real number of people is likely much higher. The Russian drive to force a Ukrainian capitulation coincides with a second round of negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian officials, scheduled for Wednesday. The first round, held on the Belarus border, yielded no positive results. Russian president Vladimir Putin has drawn global condemnation for ordering the invasion of Ukraine last Thursday, but the west has responded with sanctions that have sent the rouble to historic lows and raised the prospect of a severe recession in Russia. The sanctions are designed to shut off Russia’s economy from the global financial system, pushing international companies to halt sales, cut ties, and dump tens of billions of dollars’ worth of investments. The sanctions have had an immediate impact on Russia’s economy, with queues forming outside banks as Russians rush to salvage their savings. Apple, Exxon, Ford, Nike, Boeing and Jaguar Land Rover have joined the list of multinational companies that suspended sales of their products or other operations in Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine, which is not a member of Nato, has called on the western military alliance to implement a no-fly zone – a request rejected by Washington, which fears stoking a direct conflict between the world’s two biggest nuclear powers. The US, Germany, Sweden and other countries have instead sent weapons to Kyiv, and treasury secretary Janet Yellen said the United States had agreed with partners to convene a taskforce “to freeze and seize the assets of key Russian elites”. The move “will inflict financial pain on the powerful individuals surrounding Putin and make clear that no one is beyond our collective reach,” Yellen said in a statement following a Tuesday call with Group of Seven officials. The IMF and the World Bank condemned the Russian action in Ukraine and the “horrifying” suffering of people there, and pledged a $3bn package of support for the country in a strongly worded joint statement.",News/World news,Bombardment of Ukraine’s cities intensifies as Russia counters resistance with air strikes,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/ukraine-cities-bombardment-russia-attack-kyiv-kharkiv-russian-war-invasion
3/2/2022,"Apple has said it will pause all product sales in Russia, heeding requests from Ukrainian officials to take action against the country in response to its invasion. “We are deeply concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and stand with all of the people who are suffering as a result of the violence,” Apple said in a statement on Tuesday. The company outlined a number of actions in response to the invasion, including stopping all exports into its sales channels in the country. It added that Apple Pay and other services had been limited, and that Russian state media, RT News and Sputnik News, were no longer available for download from the Apple Store outside Russia. The decision came days after Ukrainian officials called on the tech companies to take further action against Russia, urging them to restrict access to their services within the country, more forcefully curtail the spread of false information, and crack down on Russian state-backed outlets. “In 2022, modern technology is perhaps the best answer to the tanks, multiple rocket launchers and missiles,” said the Ukraine vice-prime minister and minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, in a letter to Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook. Following the announcement on Tuesday he urged Cook to “finish the job” and block access to the App Store in Russia. “They kill our children, now kill their access!” he tweeted. The decision comes as tech companies face increased scrutiny over their response to the ongoing conflict. With billions flocking to social media for news on the war and Russian state media using tech to disseminate its own messaging, concerns about mis- and disinformation are on the rise. Neighboring countries have made similar requests, with the prime ministers of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia sending a joint letter to the chief executives of Google, Facebook and Twitter last week. “Although the online platforms have undertaken significant efforts to address the Russian government’s unprecedented assault on truth, they have not done enough,” they said in the letter. Other companies have also taken action, with Reddit announcing on Tuesday it has quarantined its r/Russia channel to address a rise in misinformation – making it more difficult for users to find by suspending it from searches, recommendations and feeds. Facebook’s parent company, Meta, has taken steps including barring Russian state-run media from selling ads on its platforms, removing networks of accounts spreading misinformation, and blocking access to RT and Sputnik across the European Union. An activist group monitoring Facebook policy that calls itself the Real Facebook Oversight Board has urged the platform to take “more aggressive action” to stop the spread of misinformation. “Facebook is following its damage control playbook, taking a victory lap for action that looks good on the surface but falls tragically short,” it said.",News/Technology,Apple to pause product sales in Russia as tech firms feel pressure over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/01/apple-russia-ukraine-facebook
