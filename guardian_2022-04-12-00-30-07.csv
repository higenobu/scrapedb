4/12/2022,"A gang accused of stealing the £3.75m Portland tiara and brooch from a Nottinghamshire gallery in 2018 was involved in a number of “ruthlessly executed” burglaries that also targeted footballers Ashley Cole and Tom Huddlestone, a court has heard. Opening the case against 11 defendants at Nottingham crown court, the prosecutor, Michael Brady QC, said the burglaries and violent robberies were “extremely serious, high-profile and carefully planned”. At about 10pm on 20 November 2018, three members of the group are alleged to have broken into the Harley gallery on the Welbeck estate in Nottinghamshire and stolen the tiara and brooch within eight minutes, before any security personnel could arrive. They wore motorcycle helmets and boiler suits, and each was carrying a hand or power tool used to gain entry to the gallery, vault and display case, the court heard. The diamond-encrusted Cartier jewellery, worn by the Duchess of Portland at the coronation of Edward VII in 1902, was stolen in a “professionally executed, well-planned offence”, the jury was told. Brady said the theft was a “shocking event” and the pieces would “never be seen again in their original state”, having been transported to a jeweller’s in Hatton Garden, London, for conversion hours after the break-in. Video footage seized by police showed Ashley Cumberpatch, one of the defendants alleged to have carried out the burglary, had filmed a visit to the site with his partner and children on a GoPro camera a year before as part of a reconnaissance exercise. The defendant can be heard marvelling at the items in the Portland collection, which also included a Michelangelo painting and a pearl earring worn by Charles I at his execution, and dwelling in front of the glass case housing the tiara and brooch. Towards the end of the visit he handed the camera to his partner, Kelly Duong, who is charged with conspiracy to burgle in relation to the theft of the tiara. She is heard saying she will film some nearby sheep “so it looks like I’m filming everything”. Defendant Kurtis Dilks is also alleged to have been part of a group who robbed the former England defender Cole and his partner, Sharon Canu, of watches, mobile phones, cash, a Gucci bag, headphones and a BMW smart key during a break-in at their home in January 2020. The home of the former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Huddlestone was targeted in a “well-planned operation” while he was playing a match for Derby County. Dilks, Cumberpatch and Andrew MacDonald are accused of conspiring to rob Huddlestone’s wife, Joanna Dixon, of £500,000 worth of jewellery and handbags, including her wedding and engagement rings. Jurors were told the robbers used cable ties to fasten Dixon’s hands behind her back, with one allegedly saying: “Don’t make this difficult, we don’t want to manhandle you.” Brady said: “The presence of householders did not deter these defendants. They were armed with weapons and the means to subdue them. The presence of children did not perturb them.” Stolen items from the burglaries were passed to Tevfik Guccuk and Sercan Evsin, professional handlers who “operated an ostensibly legitimate jewellery business in Hatton Garden”, Brady said. “Such was the value and conspicuous nature of some of the items stolen that it was not possible to sell them in the UK,” he told the jury. “The inference to be drawn from the evidence is that at times the property had to be disposed of abroad.” The diamond-encrusted tiara, whose centrepiece is the Portland diamond, has been described as a national treasure. “It is difficult to overstate the importance and cultural value of these pieces of jewellery,” Brady said, adding that many of the items in the Portland collection were “extremely valuable, unique and of significant historical importance”. The defendants deny all charges.

4/12/2022,"Jeremy Corbyn will not have the Labour whip restored while he continues to associate with the Stop the War coalition, Keir Starmer has suggested, saying it was “very clear” those who wanted to be Labour MPs had to be supporters of Nato and reject “false equivalence” between Nato and Russian aggression. Starmer has previously suggested Corbyn may be allowed to return to sitting as a Labour MP if he apologises for a statement made in the wake of the equalities’ watchdog report into antisemitism. But speaking to the Guardian on Monday, the Labour leader suggested there was now a bigger obstacle to his return. “Amongst the very clear changes of the Labour party that I’ve made, one is our approach on antisemitism, where I said I would tear it out by the roots. And that obviously led to the whip being removed from Jeremy Corbyn because of his response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission,” he said. “And the other is to say there is no place in the Labour party for this false equivalence between Russian aggression and Nato, which is why the chief whip wrote letters to the Labour MPs on both those issues. I couldn’t be clearer about the Labour party that I lead.” The Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted Labour’s chief whip to write to all Labour MPs who had signed a Stop the War statement, warning them of disciplinary action if they did not withdraw their names. The former shadow cabinet ministers Diane Abbott and John McDonnell, key Corbyn allies, also withdrew from a Stop the War rally. Corbyn both signed the statement and spoke at the rally. The motion urged Nato to “call a halt to its eastward expansion” and accused the UK government of “sabre-rattling” over Ukraine. He has since told Jacobin he is “horrified at the war in Ukraine, horrified at the loss of life”, but defended Stop the War, saying there was “no evidence that they’ve done anything other than stand up for peace around the world”. Pressed on whether that meant Corbyn could not return until he too had disavowed his association with Stop the War, Starmer said that no one “should be in any doubt” about where Labour stood on both those issues, “on our unshakable support for Nato and on tearing out antisemitism.” He said they were “very clear” requisites for being a Labour MP. “That’s the Labour party I lead.” There have been private efforts by some leftwing MPs to attempt to bring a resolution to Corbyn’s suspension in recent months, which would have included the offer of a further apology, but sources on both sides have said efforts have reached an impasse. Though he has been readmitted as a Labour member, Starmer has not allowed him to take the Labour whip, meaning he cannot sit as a Labour MP. In a letter from the chief whip, Corbyn had been told he must commit to supporting the party’s efforts to comply with recommendations by the watchdog and apologise unequivocally for statements made after the critical report. Allies of the former Labour leader have previously suggested they do not believe Starmer’s office was prepared to have discussions in good faith and claim a deal that was negotiated to readmit him after a clarifying statement was never upheld.",News/Politics,"Corbyn will not regain Labour whip while endorsing Stop the War, suggests Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/11/jeremy-corbyn-will-not-have-labour-whip-restored-starmer-suggests
4/12/2022,"Acouple of months after causing widespread astonishment and dismay in the sport by selling some of its most precious naming and image rights to the gaming giant Playtech, Nevin Truesdale, the Jockey Club’s chief executive, stuck his head above the parapet this weekend, to defend the Playtech deal and discuss all things Jockey Club, in a fascinating interview with the Racing Post’s senior writer, Lee Mottershead. The Playtech deal, Truesdale said, had been “a little misunderstood”. The rapid-play gaming products that will be allowed to parasitise events like the Cheltenham Festival and Grand National are, he claimed, “very safe and they’ve been around for years, with close links to racing. For us, it’s about saying, if this is already happening using brands closely associated with our own, and if we’re in a position to make some money out of it, shouldn’t we be involved?” As defences go, Derby County’s back line in their disastrous 2007-08 Premier League campaign was watertight by comparison. It has a big hole in the middle, where the argument should be. “Misunderstood” is the first giveaway, the first word that chief execs (and politicians too) tend to grab for when they do something that everyone else thinks is a terrible idea. In politics, it is the sure sign of an imminent U-turn. In business, unfortunately, five-year contracts are much more difficult and expensive to unpick. Of greater concern, though, is Truesdale’s persistent failure to see the Playtech deal in the context of the huge regulatory change which is certain to be unleashed on Britain’s gambling industry long before the contract even hits halfway. Those “close links” between gaming – on fixed-margin casino products – and betting with variable margins, on racing and other sports, are the result of gaming muscling in on racing’s territory since the 2005 Gambling Act wiped out most of the previous distinctions between the two. The biggest brands in British gambling have been making hay ever since, first by sucking billions of pounds from – for the most part – the most deprived areas of the country via £100-a-spin gaming machines, and also by vigorously cross-promoting gaming products to sports punters wherever possible. But they were never going to get away with it forever, and at some point in the not-too-distant future, a hard rain’s a-gonna fall. The vital issue for racing is how much of it will fall specifically on gaming, which is acknowledged to have much higher problem-gambling rates than betting, and how much drenches everything else. The most sensible plan is for racing to be standing as far away from gaming as possible when the heavens open. The Jockey Club’s Playtech deal is more akin to standing under the tallest tree around when it feels like there’s thunder in the air. While Truesdale has taken the flak, however, he can only act with the say-so of the stewards of the Jockey Club, the organisation’s equivalent of a board of directors. The Playtech contract could not have been signed without their approval, so who, exactly, should take ultimate responsibility? Oddly enough, and for the moment at least, it is not an easy question for an interested racing fan to answer. Any normal business with an annual turnover north of £200m might be expected to list of its board of directors somewhere on its website, but for several months now, the only person with a profile on the Jockey Club’s website has been Sandy Dudgeon, the senior steward. A call to the Jockey Club reveals that while there are normally seven stewards, since 1 January this year there have been eight. The lack of bios on the website for the last three-and-a-half months is due, it seems, to a lack of photographs of two new members – Carolyn Warren and William Wyatt – and will be rectified shortly. The other five stewards are Lord Teddy Grimthorpe, Dido Harding, Tim Syder, Justin Dowley and William Rucker. Only two of those would be instantly recognised by a significant number of racing fans, and probably just the one for racing-related reasons. But – gender aside – they are all fairly typical of the individuals that have steered the Jockey Club throughout its 272-year existence, for the most part as the sport’s ruler and regulator and, since 1993, as its most powerful commercial group. They are steeped in racing, frequently from birth, and for the most part as owners and breeders too. They work unpaid, undoubtedly share the fans’ passion for the sport, and have the same interest in seeing it thrive. At the same time, though, it inevitably feels increasingly outdated that self-appointed clubs of people who were born with a 20-length lead should have total control of such power, wealth and influence in an industry which employs tens of thousands of people. Short-sighted, strategically inept choices like the Playtech contract can only increase scrutiny. Flogging the good name of some of sport’s crown jewels to a gaming firm was a betrayal of racing’s interests, for short-term gain, by a body operating under a Royal Charter which obliges it to act for the long-term good of the sport as a whole. That obligation should have been the first thing on their minds when Playtech came calling and they asked themselves “why not?”.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Jockey Club’s Playtech deal defence is very leaky,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/11/talking-horses-jockey-club-playtech-deal-defence-is-worryingly-leaky-horse-racing
4/12/2022,"John Oliver took aim at the dark art of data brokers, raising the alarm on unregulated practices that many internet users are unaware of. The Last Week Tonight host discussed the “unsettling moments” that often happen throughout the day online, as we discover that companies are “monitoring our activities a little bit closer than we would like”. He called attention to data brokers, who are part of a multibillion-dollar industry that encompasses “everyone from credit reporting companies to these weird people-finding websites whenever you Google the name of your friend’s sketchy new boyfriend”. They “collect your personal information and then resell or share it with others” and have once been referred to as the “middlemen of surveillance capitalism”. It’s a sprawling, unregulated ecosystem”, and looking into what they do and how they do it can get “very creepy, very fast”. “They know significantly more about you than you might think, and do significantly more with it than you might like,” Oliver said. The main tools are cookies, which enable websites to remember you and have evolved to include third-party cookies, which track where else you are going on the internet. “I don’t know about you but I don’t want a whole crowd of strangers watching what I search for on the internet,” he said. “Not because it’s gross, but because it’s private.” The process takes breadcrumbs of where we have gone and what we have done online, and packages it to share with marketing firms. Users are then sorted into groups, such as couples with clout, ambitious singles, boomers and boomerangs and kids and cabernet. The dark side of this includes more narrowly targeted lists, which separate us by certain ailments or sexual preferences. Investigations have found that people are defined by their depression, diabetes, cancer and pregnancy. It’s a “system that seems ripe for abuse” as “what they can buy is pretty troubling”. While marketing firms have claimed the data is anonymous, the process of “de-anonymising” is fairly easy as Oliver details as people can be discovered by a quick data investigation. “None of us are really anonymous online,” he said. He called it all “objectively unsettling” and used an example of a priest who was forced to resign after a Catholic newsletter used app data signals from Grindr and matched his phone to his residence, outing him. It’s a “massive, harmful invasion of privacy” and also incredibly dangerous. He used the example of a domestic violence victim whose address came up on a data broker website. Oliver also shared a horrifying story of a stalker who killed a former classmate after finding her with info he brought for $45. Requesting removal of information is a “complex process” and there is no federal law requiring that the companies honour an opt-out request. It also suits the government as both FBI and Ice have bought data to aid criminal investigations and deportations. “The entire economy of the internet is basically built on this practice,” he said. “All the free stuff that you take for granted online is only free because you are the product.” He said there needs to be a comprehensive federal privacy law but many politicians build their campaigns on use of personal data. He used the example of the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988, which was passed when Congress freaked out when they realised their video rental histories could be shared. “It seems when Congress’s own privacy is at risk they somehow find a way to act,” he said. To show this, Oliver’s team used “perfectly legal bits of fuckery” to target members of Congress. They bought ads and showed them to men over 45 in DC who had searched for divorce, massage, hair loss and mid-life crisis, creating a group called Congress and cabernet. “This whole exercise was fucking creepy,” he said with ads that pushed divorce help, Ted Cruz erotic fiction and voting twice. He said it might worry members of Congress that he now has the information of who clicked on what. “You might want to channel that worry into making sure that I can’t do anything with it,” he said.",Arts/Television & radio,John Oliver on online data brokers: ‘What they can buy is pretty troubling’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/11/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-data-brokers
4/12/2022,"“It is one of the biggest challenges to perform as the away team at the Bernabéu and it is even more difficult if you have to earn a certain result,” Thomas Tuchel said, sounding very much like a man in need of another marathon chocolate session to raise the mood before Chelsea attempt to pull off one of the unlikeliest comebacks in the history of the Champions League. On first inspection it seemed Tuchel was raising the white flag again. He had written the tie off after Chelsea lost the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid last week, with their title defence in serious peril following an emphatic 3-1 home defeat, and he kept the talk of heroic comebacks to a minimum before Tuesday night’s return game. “If you need to win with a minimum of two goals it makes it almost impossible,” said Tuchel, who briefly appeared to be on the verge of announcing he was taking the youth team to Spain. “You need to overperform.” Amid the pessimism, though, there was a sense of Madrid being lured into a trap; a sense of Tuchel trying to convince Carlo Ancelotti’s players to lower their guard. “There are many comebacks,” Mateo Kovacic pointed out later, the Chelsea midfielder’s mind drifting back to the west Londoners upsetting the odds en route to becoming European champions in 2012. “They lost 3-1 at Napoli and came back at Stamford Bridge. Football is always surprising.” It certainly has been in this competition in recent seasons. Sometimes logic flies out the window, as Tuchel discovered when his Paris Saint-Germain side somehow threw away a commanding lead over Manchester United in 2019. The German knows what happens when complacency sets in and, with away goals no longer counting double, there is no doubt that in private he will be giving a much bolder message to Chelsea’s players, who will be sent out with instructions to test Madrid’s nerve and believe that anything is possible. It will not be easy. Karim Benzema destroyed Chelsea last week, scoring a ruthless hat-trick, and Ancelotti got the better of Tuchel tactically. Vinícius Junior was able to exploit the space between Andreas Christensen and Reece James on Chelsea’s right flank during the first half, César Azpilicueta was exposed by Fede Valverde’s movement on the opposite wing and it was too easy for Madrid to play through the press, with N’Golo Kanté and Jorginho unable to stop Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric running the game in midfield. Something has to change. Christensen was hooked at half-time and Kanté also failed to make it out for the start of the second half after having one of the worst games of his Chelsea career. Nothing went to plan. Kai Havertz scored and played well up front but Mason Mount and Christian Pulisic offered little in the No 10 positions. Jorginho, mistakenly preferred to Kovacic by Tuchel, was sloppy and slow. Édouard Mendy gave away a horrible goal. Thiago Silva lost Benzema for both of the France striker’s gorgeous first-half headers. Yet focusing on individuals overlooks how Chelsea had struggled as a collective since the international break. They were hammered 4-1 by Brentford and picked apart by Madrid. With the club’s ownership situation not exactly helping the mood, Tuchel could not believe how sloppy his side had become. He gorged on chocolate to ease his stress after staying up all night to analyse the Madrid game and then delivered a few home truths during a team meeting last Thursday. “It’s never easy to come back after the international break but it’s not an excuse that we underperformed,” Kovacic said. “It was necessary to have a talk.” The result was a vastly improved performance and a 6-0 win over Southampton. Timo Werner and Mount scored twice, while Tuchel saw that Kanté and Kovacic are his best pairing in midfield at the moment. The intensity was back and Tuchel knows that Chelsea need to make more of their speed against Madrid’s veterans. “We wanted it more physical but we did not work hard enough in the first match,” Tuchel said. “We are a team that needs the physicality, commitment and investment to be a special team. We could not implement that enough in the last match, which was also due to their quality and their capacity to slow the game down. We struggled with our counter-pressing and finding intensity and runs. We will need to play a more physical game. Of course that is part of the solution.” Tuchel had clearly been thinking about the problems posed by Madrid. He has been working out how to drag them out of their comfort zone. He usually craves control but this time he could do with some chaos. It could help Chelsea defy the odds.

4/12/2022,"Charles Leclerc’s dominant win in Melbourne was a consummate display but his Ferrari was truly the class of the field. It is well balanced, versatile, quick through the corners, easy on the tyres and the engine is a powerful beast. Having written off last year and thrown everything into developing this season’s model there must be no little sense of satisfaction at Maranello. The task for Ferrari now is not to throw it away. The challenge for the engineers this season is going to be a fierce development war, as with the new regulations there will be gains to be found all season, and the team that finds them quickest will have the whip hand. Ferrari have been here before in 2017 and 2018 when their car opened as the quickest on the grid but was outpaced by Mercedes’ advances as the season went on, a setback compounded by team and driver errors. If they are to take the title the team have to be firing at maximum capacity on every level in a pressure-cooker environment, a fascinating prospect. Leclerc was almost flawless at the front of the field, sealing a grand slam at Albert Park. He is a joy to watch, the 24-year-old enjoys such a light pleasure in driving to the extent of being able to joke with his team over the radio, it is infectious. There is also a natural ease to his skill that has always been present but only now is being given full reign. His win in Bahrain showed both skill and mettle as he faced down Max Verstappen, as did his second place in Saudi Arabia. In Australia what was clear was how controlled he can be when the car is on form. Errors in recent years have done him a disservice, often being caused because he was forced to push so hard with underperforming and poorly handling machinery. This time he has what he needs under him and is a man inspired, comfortable in his confidence and execution. Lewis Hamilton exhibited the same trait when Mercedes gave him their all-conquering ride of recent years. Alexander Albon’s Williams, in contrast, is off the pace and no easy drive to handle. Albon, in his first year with the team, has come to grips with it with aplomb. At Albert Park he delivered a remarkable performance to wrestle it into 10th place and gain the team’s first point of the season. Having been disqualified from qualifying when Williams were unable to supply a fuel sample, Albon started at the very back. With a long afternoon ahead the team opted to take a chance on him making the best of a bad job. Starting on the hard tyre he stayed out for almost the whole race, working his way through the field. He made the tyres last and kept his pace throughout, such that he held seventh place until he had to take his mandatory stop one lap from the end. He emerged in 10th, a brilliant result, confirming the 26-year-old’s talent and that he has not been phased by his testing and confidence-sapping experience at Red Bull. The new race directors Niels Wittich and Eduardo Freitas, who replaced Michael Masi this season, have been forthright in their application of the rules over these opening rounds. Certainly they are stricter over issues such as track limits and impeding – which was pursued vigorously with many reprimands during practice at Albert Park. However before the weekend Wittich issued a further notice, reminding drivers that the wearing of jewellery or piercings while in the car was forbidden for safety reasons, relating to potentially impeding the exit from a car. He followed it up at the drivers’ briefing on Friday by reminding them that they could not wear non fire-retardant underwear. Who and how a check on drivers’ pants will be accomplished has yet to be revealed but Hamilton, for one, appears set for a showdown over being made to remove his bling, particularly his ear rings. “I don’t have any plans on removing them,” he said. “They are personal things. You should be able to be who you are. There is stuff that I cannot move, I literally cannot even take these out. These ones on my right ear are welded in so I would have to get it chopped off. They will be staying.” Verstappen was scathing in his assessment of his second DFN in three races that it will be impossible to fight for the title if his car cannot finish a race. But the task facing his team is more nuanced than just making their car reliable. Over the opening three rounds Ferrari enjoyed the advantage in two and in Australia the Red Bull’s weaknesses illustrated the complexity of their challenge to match their rivals. Verstappen struggled with the balance through practice, he has not felt truly comfortable with it in qualifying, a discipline in which he excelled last year. With what seems to be a narrow operating window, their tyres are graining easily and finagling their setup for what appears to be a demanding car. It is proving tricky and hard to nail down, especially where compromise is required in order to maximise its performance through tight corners such as in the final sector at Albert Park. They have pace in a straight line without doubt but if it cannot be married to a driver-friendly balance through the corners, Ferrari will leave them behind.",Sport/Sport,Lessons from the F1 season so far: Ferrari are a class apart and Albon shines | Giles Richards,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/11/what-we-have-learned-so-far-as-ferrari-show-they-are-a-class-apart

4/12/2022,"It began with the host Jason Manford joking about the danger of awards ceremony slaps but the Oscars of the theatre industry held few shocks or hard edges. Instead there was plenty of warm feeling about the resilience and can-do spirit shown through the pandemic lockdowns. A surge of pent-up energy was palpable in the room after a three-year hiatus since the last in-person ceremony but the awards themselves felt safe in their focus on big splashy revivals and well-loved adapted stories. Rebecca Frecknall’s darkly reworked juggernaut, Cabaret, deserved its seven wins, as did Lola Chakrabarti’s Life of Pi for its sensational puppetry (it claimed five awards). But the habit of finding one or two big winners felt oddly tunnel-visioned this year when it might have been the perfect opportunity to spread the love and recognition more widely. Cabaret’s two big celebrity turns by Eddie Redmayne and Jessie Buckley were charismatic but predictable winners and it is a shame that strong contenders in less perfectly formed shows went unrecognised, such as Arinzé Kene’s kinetic performance in Get Up, Stand Up! The Bob Marley Musical (the show took home a gong for its sound design instead). The winning “new” shows felt like revivals in concept too: Life of Pi has had a lucrative former life as a bestselling book and a Hollywood film. Back to the Future, which won for best new musical, is based on Robert Zemeckis’s 1985 box-office smash movie. Both could be called comfort theatre for their warm, fuzzy familiarity and striking aesthetics. Back to the Future, particularly, seems to be part of an emerging crop of adaptations from films which seem designed to drag in a generation of nostalgic 40- and 50-somethings (Moulin Rouge, which won best costume design, is among them). It was gratifying to see edgier play revivals rewarded, from the National Theatre’s The Normal Heart, for which Liz Carr won best supporting actress, to Nick Payne’s Constellations, which was daringly re-worked by Michael Longhurst to feature four pairs of casts this time around (including best actress winner Sheila Atim). A highlight came in the best entertainment or comedy win for Pride and Prejudice* (*sort of). Hit by Covid regulations and then cut short, this was a plucky David of a production against the Goliath of West End attractions and it did not gather the audiences it deserved. Writer and co-director, Isobel McArthur, collected the award and reminded us that this witty, karaoke-infused show began at Glasgow’s Tron. Producer David Pugh took a risk in bringing a former fringe show to a major West End venue and it proved to be one of the most original comedies of the year. There was no equivalent to the Oscar slap but a metaphorical sucker punch came in the “best supporting actor” category. The prize was collected by the seven actors (not all male) behind the Royal Bengal tiger, a majestic puppet full of character and drama, in Life of Pi. The puppeteers called it a landmark moment which “opens the door for more puppets in central roles of theatre”, but by this rationale, should the puppeteers behind War Horse’s Joey have won an acting gong too – and what about the talking car in Back to the Future? Shouldn’t a prerequisite for “best actor” be one human heartbeat rather than seven? The victory is, at best, an argument for creating a new category for puppeteers given the very welcome rise of high-quality puppetry in the West End.",Arts/Stage,The Olivier awards toasted theatre’s winning can-do spirit through the pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/11/the-olivier-awards-toasted-theatres-winning-can-do-spirit-through-the-pandemic
4/12/2022,"The last act of service for Sir David Amess MP followed a ritual he had performed for 38 years. This time it was in Belfairs Methodist church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, where he invited people to come to tell him their problems. Amess took his constituency surgery duties more seriously than some MPs. On this day, the offer of help was there for someone who claimed they had just moved to his constituency of Southend West, and already needed his advice. However, this was an attempt to seek not help, but jihadist martyrdom, fashioned with deceit and meant to end in bloodshed. Ali Harbi Ali, then 25, had hatched a premeditated plot to hunt down, ensnare and murder an MP. For the previous two years Ali had been crisscrossing London, carrying out reconnaissance – sometimes standing outside parliament for up to three hours – looking for an MP to assassinate. Ali saw himself as a soldier of Islamic State and wanted to punish a British lawmaker for the UK’s actions in Syria. The terrorist group had declared a state there, which became a magnet for violent extremists around the world. On Friday 15 October 2021, Ali bought a train ticket at 4.58am and set off from his home in Kentish Town, London. First he took a train across the capital, and then to Leigh-on-Sea’s small train station at 10.23am. He had booked his appointment for midday by email, providing a false address to deceive Amess’s staff. Ali’s plans to murder a politician had been frustrated so far and he finally chose Amess, who advertised his advice surgery with dates and times and places on the internet. He was also in the vanguard of MPs who resumed full face-to-face advice surgeries after the pandemic. Because Amess wanted to make it easier for his constituents to see him, he held this surgery in a church and not his constituency office, where there were some security measures. Amess’s virtue made him vulnerable. When Ali arrived at the church just before midday, nothing about him raised suspicions. The church was often busy: as well as hosting religious services, it was home to slimming classes, Irish dancing classes and “Robot Reg” to teach youngsters to read, as well as other youth activities. Ali booked in, asked to use the toilet, then returned to the waiting area. An aide to the MP chatted with Ali and was taken in by the cover story that he had just moved to the area. To the aide, Ali appeared relaxed and “chatty”, and said he liked the Southend area. Just after midday the aide walked Ali to meet Amess, who was in a side room. Once there, Ali talked to the MP about why he had moved to the area, and said he wanted to discuss politics and foreign affairs. Amess reminded Ali that the point of the surgery was to talk about specific problems. Ali was using his mobile phone during the conversation and Amess became suspicious. The MP asked if he was making a recording. Ali offered reassurance, held the phone up to Amess to show its screen, and placed it on the table. After several minutes the meeting was interrupted when Ali’s phone rang. He stood up from his chair, put his hand in his pocket and said “sorry”. He then rapidly pulled a knife from his pocket, leant over the table and stabbed the 69-year-old repeatedly in the stomach. Amess screamed at times as the blows continued, raising his hands to defend himself. Two constituents, one male and one female, arrived at the church entrance for their appointment, entering a scene of mayhem and terror. One saw Ali clutching a knife, and the assailant said: “I’ve killed him”. She did not run, despite the obvious danger. She asked Ali to put down the knife and asked if she could go to help the mortally wounded MP. Ali refused and told her to get back. A man who entered the church at that time saw Ali standing under the strip lights in the church hall, holding a knife in his right hand, saying: “I want to kill David, I want them all to die.” Ali was still on the phone and the witness could hear a female voice saying “what have you done”, to which Ali replied he had done it because of Syria and that he wanted to be shot and killed. The man asked Ali why he had done it and he replied: “I wanted to kill David and every MP who voted for bombings in Syria, I wanted to die, be shot and be a hero.” The man asked Ali to let him check on Amess, but Ali raised the knife to scare him away as the MP bled. Amess lay dying, slumped in the church, stabbed 21 times in total. All the blows had been directed only at him, with Ali making no attempt to harm anyone else, despite ample time and opportunity. While waiting for the police, Ali sent a message he had written three weeks earlier on his Samsung mobile phone to all of his WhatsApp contacts. It gave what he saw as his justification for the killing of the backbench MP. Officers from Essex police arrived within minutes. At first they decided to wait for armed officers to arrive, faced with scenes of fear and terror. One woman told them: “He’s stabbed David. The man is still inside the church and he is brandishing a knife, waving it around. He will stab you if you go in, he will stab you.” The two officers from Essex police walked into the church and saw Ali, a knife in his right hand and a phone in his left, which he seemed to still be talking on. The police were armed with extendable batons and PAVA spray. The two officers shouted at Ali, ordering him to drop the knife. He could see their protective equipment in their hands and asked if it was a gun or a Taser, to which one officer replied: “It’s not a gun.” Ali then rushed at the two officers, who backed away and shouted for him to drop the knife. Ali complied, placing the knife on the ground. The officers grabbed Ali by the arms and placed him under arrest. Ali was taken into custody as paramedics battled to save Amess. An air ambulance was called to a nearby field but was not used, so grave were the MP’s wounds. He was pronounced dead at 1.13pm, barely an hour after the attack. An inquest later heard that Amess died from multiple stab wounds to the chest area. With Ali in custody, Essex police started passing information to Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command, known as SO15. Some suspects talk when arrested, others do not. Ali very quickly confessed, telling police that in 2014 he was such a devotee of IS that he considered travelling to Syria to join their nascent caliphate, but did not do so. By 2017 he had chosen to carry out an attack in the UK. Lockdowns during the Covid pandemic disrupted his plans after March 2020, Ali said. As Britain opened up, and restrictions allowed people on to the streets, Ali stepped up his efforts. He confessed all to police, including how he had settled on a plan some years ago to kill an MP. He mentioned two in particular, MPs whom he had stalked as he carried out reconnaissance ahead of a potential attack. He had made repeated visits to the London address of the cabinet minister Michael Gove, and drawn up plans to kill him, including one while he was out jogging. Ali told police that in September 2021 he attended the constituency surgery of a different MP in London, Mike Freer, to reconnoitre an attack, but decided it would be too difficult. He also went to the Houses of Parliament to carry out this reconnaissance, but backed out because he felt the armed police presence was too great. That plot thwarted, Ali told police he made an appointment to speak to Amess during his regular constituency surgery with the intention of murdering him on 15 October. Two notes found on Ali’s phone were written in May 2019 and contained Gove’s home address and details of an attack plan. Detectives uncovered extensive evidence of Ali, always alone, conducting hostile reconnaissance. They tracked his phone using cell site analysis, triangulated with his bank card usage from the previous two years as he travelled across London on the tube, and found CCTV footage confirming he was watching MPs as his plans developed. He was located outside Gove’s address on six occasions, beginning on 9 March 2021, through to July. On 20 July that year he conducted “hostile reconnaissance” outside parliament, and then again on 21 and 22 July for almost two hours. He did so again on 18 August and 20 and 22 September. It is not known whether he was armed with a knife. MI5 started searching for traces of Ali on their databases but there were none, as he was unknown as a terrorist suspect to them. But ​checks by police on their systems showed he had appeared on their radar. ​S​even years earlier, when Ali was studying, he concerned teachers enough that they contacted Prevent, the official counter-radicalisation scheme. There, Ali was assessed as being of enough concern that he should receive intensive help and support on the Channel scheme. That year, in 2014, he was considering joining IS in Syria. People referred to Channel are ​among those of most concern and are supposedly offered intensive help to turn them away from the ideology of violent extremism. Ali had volunteered to take part in the Channel scheme. He strung those working with him on Channel along. In fact, he was becoming radicalised at the same time he was convincing them he posed no terrorist danger. Over seven years, mainly via the internet, he became convinced by IS propaganda that violence was mandated by his religion. He told the court he had enjoyed a problem-free childhood, and at one stage had wanted to be a doctor. For Prevent he had been seen as a success story after several months of support. His details were not passed on to MI5 or counter-terrorism police​, a sign he was thought not to pose a danger. Seven years later, that assessment was proven wrong, as an ideology of hate consumed him​, with disastrous and chilling consequences.",News/UK news,‘I’ve killed him’: David Amess murder was last act of two-year plot,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/david-amess-last-act-two-year-plot-ali-harbi-ali
4/12/2022,"A lacklustre French presidential election campaign overshadowed first by the Covid pandemic and then by the war in Ukraine has exploded into life, propelling Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen into what looks like being a brutal runoff. Here are five key takeaways from the first round of voting as France and wider Europe brace for a nervous two weeks before the deciding 24 April vote that will determine who occupies the Élysée Palace for the next five years. In the end it was a more comfortable victory for the incumbent than many pollsters and commentators had predicted: Macron finished on 27.8% of the vote, while Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally) managed 23.1%. Both scored higher than in the previous first round in 2017, but the gap between them was also wider, giving Macron a much-needed boost going into the second round after weeks when the momentum was all Le Pen’s. Although early second-round polls show the president marginally ahead, the final result is far from certain. Le Pen will gain votes from the far-right TV pundit Éric Zemmour, and Macron from the more mainstream right and left and the Greens. But he will also need the backing of some who voted for the radical-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon, many of whom would rather abstain or – although the La France Insoumise (Unbowed France) leader urged them not to – vote for Le Pen. The former Socialist minister came in at a very close third with a significantly higher than expected 22% and at one stage, late in the evening as the big-city votes were being counted, looked as if he might pip Le Pen to the second round. Cementing his status as the only powerful voice on a weak and divided left, his passionate oratory and radical programme were a big hit with the young: he was far and away the most popular candidate among 18- to 34-year-old voters – who unfortunately for him were also the least likely age group to vote. He also benefited from a last-minute surge from left-leaning voters initially tempted by parties such as the Greens and the Communists but who concluded, too late in the day, that despite some of his more extreme policies Mélenchon was the only leftwing candidate with a chance of making it to the second round. The radical realignment of French politics that began in 2017 when Macron swept to power at the head of his “neither left nor right” startup reached its logical conclusion with the near-total electoral destruction of France’s two traditional parties of government, the rightwing Les Républicains and the Socialist party. On the right, Valérie Pécresse scored just 4.7%; the deep divide between moderates and hardliners in her party, still a force at local level, could now see it implode. On the left, the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, managed just 1.7%, also a historic low for a Socialist party that only a decade ago controlled the Élysée, parliament and most of France’s regions. In the place of the classic left-right divide has emerged a new political landscape made up of a mainstream bloc in the centre that is liberal, pro-European and globalist, and by two extremes on the right and left that are, to varying degrees and in different ways, populist, protectionist, and nationalist and/or identitarian. Roughly 53% of registered French voters who cast their ballots on Sunday voted for an anti-establishment candidate, on the right or the left. Perceived by many as “the president of the rich”, Macron’s challenge in the second round will be to persuade enough of them that though they may dislike him, they loathe Le Pen more. The far-right leader’s relentless focus on the cost of living crisis was smart and spoke to many voters’ core concerns. Macron will seek to point out the incoherences in her programme, defend his economic record and paint a forward-looking picture; she will portray him as out of touch and a representative of the elite. Perhaps the most striking of the multiple divides between the two rivals’ voters was this one, pinpointed by pollsters Ipsos: 43% of voters who said they were “very satisfied” with their life voted for Macron, compared to 21% for Le Pen, while 46% of those who said they were “not at all satisfied” voted Le Pen and just 4% Macron. Zemmour’s pro-Kremlin rhetoric came back to bite him, but for all Le Pen’s past cosying up to the Russian president – including Kremlin photo ops, support for his annexation of Crimea and campaign loans from Moscow banks – she was quick to condemn the Ukraine invasion and paid no electoral price for her previous positions. Macron initially benefited from a rally-round-the-flag polling boost at the outbreak of the war, and his shuttle and telephone diplomacy with Moscow since has played well with his electoral base, for whom, polls suggest, foreign affairs tend to matter more than for voters likely to cast their ballot for Le Pen. The second-round campaign will produce a sharper focus on the far-right leader’s past Kremlin sympathies, which some voters may be inclined to view as a potentially significant factor in a vote that Le Pen herself described as “a fundamental choice between two opposing visions of society and civilisation”. Largely absent from the race until now, Macron will be far more active during the second round, with campaign visits planned to northern and eastern France on Monday and Tuesday before a big rally in Marseille on Saturday. The highlight of Le Pen’s first week will be a rally in Avignon on Thursday. Both candidates are booked on several evening TV news shows before the key event of the campaign, the traditional head-to-head candidates’ debate at 9pm on 20 April. Le Pen’s disastrous performance in the 2017 debate is widely seen as having ensured her defeat; she will not want to make the same mistake again. At midnight on Friday 22 April the mandatory period of “electoral silence” begins during which the media will be barred from quoting candidates or publishing opinion polls, with voting stations due to open at 8am on Sunday 24 April. Early estimates of the result will come as polls close at 8pm local time.",News/World news,France election: five key takeaways and moments ahead ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/france-election-key-takeaways-emmanuel-macron-marine-le-pen-runoff-first-round-voting-presidential-race
4/12/2022,"On 6 May 2017, the day Emmanuel Macron was elected president of France after running on a “neither-left-nor-right” platform and defeating his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen, the new ruler made a promise to the French people: that the country would never again see a far-right candidate reach the second round of the presidential election. “Our task is immense,” Macron said as he took office. “In the five years to come, my responsibility will be to appease fears, to revive the French optimism … I will fight with all my strength against the divisions that undermine us.” He vowed to “rally and reconcile” the French, for “the unity of the people and the country”. Today, almost five years later, France woke up to the result of the first round of the presidential election – and the prospect, once again, of a runoff between Macron and Le Pen. The incumbent president (of the La République En Marche party, founded by Macron in 2016) won 27.6% of the vote on Sunday, followed by Le Pen (National Rally, formerly National Front) with 23.4%. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the leftwing party La France Insoumise, came close but failed to qualify for the runoff with 22%; then came Éric Zemmour (Reconquête party), the openly racist candidate who ran on a platform based entirely on the “great replacement” theory, with 7.1%. France’s traditional parties are close to extinction: Valérie Pécresse, of the rightwing Républicains, got only 4.8%, while Yannick Jadot of the Greens reached 4.6% and Socialist candidate (and Paris mayor) Anne Hidalgo, only 1.8%. None of the three reached the 5% threshold to be fully reimbursed for their campaign spending, effectively putting their parties’ futures in danger. Bleaker still: add up Le Pen and Zemmour’s results, and you’ll realise that almost one in three of my fellow citizens who cast a ballot has chosen to vote for the far right, although turnout was low (74% of the population voted, compared with 79% in 2017). Macron has had many shortcomings, but this one really stings. He has failed to honour his first and most crucial pledge to the French – and now it feels like Groundhog Day, except with fewer groundhogs and more far-right threat. In the run-up to the first round, Macron admitted that he “did not manage to contain” the rise of the far right. It would have been more honest to confess that he has done very little to prevent it. In five years, France has spectacularly shifted to the right, to the point that far-right theories such as the “great replacement” conspiracy, which states that white European populations are being replaced by “non-European” people, has been voiced not only by Zemmour, but also Pécresse, who later tried to distance herself from her initial remarks. The media are in no small part responsible, having let anti-Islam rhetoric run rampant on air and having fed a morbid fascination for Zemmour’s views that greatly favoured his candidacy. But instead of distancing himself from the far right, Macron has dangerously played on its turf, adopting a tough stance on immigration that saw police officers destroying refugees’ tents in Calais, invoking the language of the founder of the far-right group Action Française in the Assemblée Nationale, paying homage to the “great soldier” Marshal Pétain, the 1940s French leader who collaborated with the Nazis, and giving interviews to far-right magazines. During the campaign, Macron has condemned Zemmour’s views, but just last year, Zemmour revealed that the president had asked him for a brief on the immigration measures he’d like to see applied. Facing Le Pen on a TV show in February 2021, Macron’s interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, declared that she was “too soft on immigration”. In 2020, when Zemmour was verbally abused on the streets, Macron personally called him to express support; yet in 2021, when leftwingers, including Mélenchon, were targeted with death threats by far-right extremists in a video calling to “shoot down leftists”, the president remained silent. His government has failed to condemn the rising number of attacks by far-right groups in Paris, Lyon, Strasbourg and Nantes. How is this supposed to convince leftwing voters that choosing Macron on 24 April will help contain the far-right threat? The president effectively spent five years maintaining the far right as his only credible opponent for 2022, but one thing has changed since 2017: this time, Le Pen has a real chance of winning. Polls currently show an extremely close race, with Macron at 54% to Le Pen’s 46% for the second round – a much thinner margin than in 2017, when Macron defeated her by 66% to 34%. I lived in the UK during the EU referendum campaign; now that I’m back in France, these polls bring the Brexit result to mind. A victory for Le Pen should terrify anyone who cares about democracy and peace. Le Monde has warned that “the changes she is planning to the constitution aim for the implementation of an authoritarian system”; and she has several times declared her “admiration” for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. In his concession speech last night, Mélenchon said France now must “choose between two evils” and called on voters to “not give one vote to Le Pen”. One of these two is definitely more evil than the other, but the choice is nonetheless a painful one for the French left. Many feel betrayed after five years of Macron’s liberal, rightwing reforms that have widened the gap between the rich and poor, given greater powers to the police (who visited violence on protesters during the “gilets jaunes” crisis) and failed to implement any real measure to curb emissions. Macron now has two weeks to reverse course and show the left he cares about the climate and social justice. He could, for instance, finally pledge to implement the 100 green measures he asked French citizens to come up with before discarding almost all of them in 2021. He could walk back on his widely hated pensions reform. He could announce a real plan to save the greatly underfunded public hospital and school system. This would “rally and reconcile” many more voters than playing on the far right’s turf ever will. It may be too late, but it’s well worth a try. Pauline Bock is a French journalist based in Paris.

4/12/2022,"When Russian soldiers left the village of Novyi Bykiv after a month of occupation, Natalia Samson returned to her house to find they had stolen her perfumes, jewellery, some wine, a scooter, a novelty cushion and a collection of old coins. A few days later she ventured into the village school, where she works as the deputy headteacher, and discovered the Russians had taken most of the computers, the projectors and other electronic equipment. In the headteacher’s office, an opened pair of scissors had been inserted into a plasma screen that was left behind, apparently in an attempt to ensure that what could not be stolen was instead destroyed. “People saw them simply loading everything on to Ural trucks, everything they could get their hands on,” said Samson, shaking her head in disbelief. A dozen houses on the village’s main street had been looted, as well as all the shops. Other villagers reported losing washing machines, food, laptops and even a sofa. Over the past week, during reporting from numerous places where Russian troops had occupied Ukrainian territory, the Guardian has collected evidence that suggests looting by Russian forces was not merely a case of a few wayward soldiers, but a systematic part of Russian military behaviour, across multiple towns and villages. Reports of looting have prompted widespread outrage among Ukrainians, as well as among Russians opposed to the war. “Those who fight like this are not regular army, but rabble,” wrote Vladimir Pastukhov, a liberal Russian political scientist who is a columnist for Novaya Gazeta. “Even in the Soviet and Nazi armies, looting was fought as much as possible, albeit not always successfully. In the Russian army … it is a form of additional motivation of the personnel.” At one flat in Irpin, a town outside Kyiv that was partially controlled by Russian forces for part of the last month, one family returned home to discover that Russian soldiers had been living there. They found discarded alcohol bottles, food wrappers and cigarette butts strewn around the apartment, large piles of faeces blocking the toilets and family photographs torn and thrown around the house. They also found that a lot of things had gone missing. “They took away all the clothes – literally everything, male and female coats, boots, shirts, jackets, even my dresses and lingerie,” said one of the residents, who asked for the family’s names not to be used, but supplied photographs of the damage. According to Hajun, a Belarusian investigative media project, more than 128 packages – totalling nearly 3,000kg of freight – were sent to Rubtsovsk alone from the Belarusian border town of Mazyr in video shot on 2 April this month. Rubtsovsk, which is located in the southern Altai Krai region of Russia, is a poor town known for hosting four prison facilities. The data on the parcels was collected during a three-hour surveillance video that showed Russian soldiers wrapping and stuffing clothing, TVs, tools, fishing equipment, car batteries and other household items into packages before they were sent as far as Siberia or even to Russian towns close to the Pacific Ocean. In the surveillance video, soldiers in fatigues joke with other customers as they shuffle about the cramped office for hours, laughing as a soldier comes in with a looted e-scooter to be sent back to Russia. Hajun published the data of 16 Russian soldiers who had sent parcels back to Russia on 2 April from the offices of CDEK, a Russian express delivery company that works across the former Soviet Union. The influx of looted goods, as well as growing attention to Russian looting in Ukraine, has led the company to begin requiring a bill of sale or check from a store in order to send goods abroad. Hajun identified Evgeny Kovalenko as the solider who sent the most freight that day: 17 parcels totalling 440kg. According to Hajun, that included tools, speakers, a table and a tent. The Guardian has attempted to contact a number of the soldiers accused of looting, without success. The Russian sociologist Alexandra Arkhipova said it was not just poverty and material shortages among soldiers that led to the widespread looting. “A lot of Russian soldiers feel this war is absolutely useless and senseless. It’s an absurd war and they are staying in Ukraine with the immediate risk of being killed … So [they think]: ‘I’ll take this computer because my kid needs a computer back home.’ It makes a senseless situation less absurd and more practical,” she said. However, this does not explain the destruction that has accompanied the looting. Many people have found their houses or businesses defaced with pro-Russian graffiti. In the town of Trostianets, soldiers smeared faeces on the walls of a meat shop that they also looted. Many homes appear to have been demonstratively smashed up. Often, the victims are people living modest lives who now find themselves with nothing. In the village of Staryi Bykiv, east of Kyiv, the Andrusha family are primarily concerned about the whereabouts of their daughter, Viktoria, who was kidnapped by Russian soldiers on 26 March on suspicion of supplying Ukrainian authorities with coordinates of Russian positions. She was held for a day with other prisoners before disappearing, and has not been seen since. But in an added insult, her father, Mykola Andrusha, reported that soldiers had robbed the family during searches of their home, taking electronics and cash. “I’m not a rich person. We had about $3,000 and about 60,000 hryvnia (£1,600). But for me, that was big money. We wanted to do house repairs – me, my wife and my daughter,” he said. The soldiers also took the family’s laptop and their mobile phones. The confirmation of widespread looting was preceded by telephone audio, leaked by Ukrainian intelligence, which claimed to reveal Russian soldiers discussing with their wives what to steal while on assignment. The authenticity of the intercepts could not be confirmed, but the reports from liberated areas has lent them credibility. “I bet all the boys have taken something there,” said one wife to her husband in one of the leaked telephone calls. “I bet you’re not alone.” “Everyone’s got a bag with him,” the soldier replied.",News/World news,‘They took our clothes’: Ukrainians returning to looted homes,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/ukrainian-homes-looted-by-russian-soldiers
4/12/2022,"Jennifer Wilson, who has died aged 89, played a pivotal role in The Brothers, a hugely popular 1970s BBC television drama about conflicts in a Midlands family haulage business. Her character, Jennifer Kingsley, was the secretary revealed as the secret lover of her boss, the patriarch and owner of the firm, Robert Hammond – who died while making love to her. The drama began with the reading of the will and the family’s shock at discovering that Hammond Transport Services had been left equally to the road haulage magnate’s three sons – and his secretary, with provision for her daughter with him. This grenade sparked the boardroom-to-bedroom dramas that would follow. “Have you ever asked why he needed me?” Jennifer taunted Robert’s widow, Mary (played by Jean Anderson), setting the tone for their relationship. Jennifer later transferred her affections to the eldest son, Edward, whom she then married. Wilson appeared in all 92 episodes (1972-76) of the drama, which also starred Hilary Tindall, Gabrielle Drake and Kate O’Mara. She had also portrayed the “other woman” in A Man of Our Times (1968), another series mixing business and domestic melodrama. Max Osborne (George Cole) was the furniture factory middle manager made redundant and offered a job in Australia, which his lover, Muriel (Wilson), encourages him to take, with the promise that she and her daughter will go with them – if he divorces his wife. Wilson followed this with the role of Detective Sergeant Helen Webb in the first series of Special Branch (1969), which featured a fictional clandestine Scotland Yard department safeguarding national security and followed Z Cars in moving police dramas on from the homely Dixon of Dock Green. Switching to another police series for a 1970 episode of Softly Softly: Task Force, Wilson played a sex worker in a three-dimensional portrayal that stood out from the many stereotypes of the time. As her character realises she is trapped in a room with a knife-wielding client, Wilson’s face positively exudes fear. After The Brothers, she spent most of her career on the stage. Jennifer was born in London, to Frederick Lohr, a writer, and Irene (nee Morgan). She grew up in Chigwell, Essex, and, aged 12, took her stepfather’s surname following her mother’s divorce and remarriage to Herbert Wilson. After attending Sibford school, Oxfordshire, she studied art at South East Technical College, in Dagenham with the intention of becoming a fashion designer. She switched to acting and won a scholarship to Rada, where she was awarded the Forbes Robertson prize. While there, she made her screen debut with a small role in a BBC TV production of The Taming of the Shrew (1952). She also appeared in the film musical biopic The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan, released in 1953, a year after her graduation. On joining Nottingham’s rep, Wilson’s first role was Rosalind in As You Like It (1952). The following year, she played Viola in Twelfth Night at the Regent’s Park open air theatre, with one critic describing her performance as “touching and true, and with a pleasant glint of humour”. Her talent for the classics led to a stint with the Old Vic theatre company (1955-56) that included playing Lady Macduff in Macbeth and Lady Capulet in Romeo and Juliet. Then, she took part in its American tour of four Shakespeare plays (1956-57) and joined a company led by Marius Goring to take Scenes from Shakespeare to Finland (1957), and India and Sri Lanka (1958). In the West End, Wilson had a long run as Florence Crompton in Spring and Port Wine (Mermaid and Apollo theatres, 1965-67) but a much shorter one as Mrs Captain Phobbs in the flop farce Lend Me Five Shillings (Vaudeville theatre, 1968). She also played Mrs Darling in Peter Pan at the Coliseum theatre (1973-74), alongside Maggie Smith as Peter Pan and Dave Allen as Captain Hook/Mr Darling, and Mrs Boyle in The Mousetrap (St Martin’s theatre, 1999-2000, 2004 and 2008-09). Wilson’s early TV roles included Kate Nickleby in a 1957 BBC serialisation of Nicholas Nickleby, during which she met her second husband, the actor-director Brian Peck, who was playing Smike. They married two years later. She also starred as Lizzie Holroyd in The Widowing of Mrs Holroyd (1961) and played Anne Appleby in the BBC glossy magazine soap Compact during 1965. Wilson’s first marriage, to the artist Stanley Swain, in 1954, ended in divorce. She and her second husband appeared on stage together many times and divided their time between homes in Britain and the south of France. In 2014, they appeared on TV in Coronation Street as Mr and Mrs Bradbury, a bickering elderly couple. Peck died in 2021. Wilson is survived by Melanie, the daughter of her first marriage.

4/12/2022,"In the 80s I was a street performer in a band called Pookiesnackenburger with Steve McNicholas. I was the drummer, and rather than carry kits around I started getting into playing objects and experimenting with visual ideas. I had an act called the Urban Warriors where we would drum wearing suits of armour. I started doing lots of stunt performances, such as being suspended off the pier in Brighton or hanging off a ship at sea.I was also doing session drumming – I was in Beats International with Norman Cook – but there was a part of me that really enjoyed performance, creating scenes and movement. We had a pitch busking at Covent Garden in London, and saw the phenomenal Drummers of Burundi there doing a publicity spot. At the end they lifted these drums up and hitched them over their shoulders, so as they walked away they looked like old fashioned dustmen with metal bins on their shoulders. That’s where the idea for the bin number came from. We started to think about the iconic things we have that make a noise. We’re not dancers, but using props allowed us to dance and make visual rhythms. Lots of crazy things happened. We did a Heineken advert; we got dragged into a TV show called The Mondo Beyondo Show by the New York performance art group the Kipper Kids, which Bette Midler was hosting – she is married to one of them. Stomp was an idea to combine all these acts and rather than just the two of us, have eight people and put it together as a show, a hybrid of music, dance and comedy. We did a 40-minute version at Brighton fringe, very high energy – we were all terrible smokers, so when we performed the whole thing through we couldn’t breathe. We got the midnight slot at the Edinburgh festival fringe in 1991. We had to go to the top of Arthur’s Seat to rehearse because it was the only place we could bang our dustbins without getting kicked out. We didn’t get a public audience because no one knew who we were, but a lot of the other performers came to watch us after their own shows. The first show was great, it was mad, there was nothing like it at the time. Rhythm is infectious, but people enjoying themselves is also infectious. I was introduced to Luke when he was coming off stage, all sweaty from doing a show at a pub in Brighton. He was 17 and quite a formidable looking young lad with a skinhead. We were a few years apart but found we had complementary interests. He is a drummer, I was originally a violinist, working in theatre. He is rambunctious and I was quiet. Quite often people thought we were brothers; we were just strangely on the same wavelength.In the early days we would do miners benefits and things like that, Luke put together the brooms piece for a benefit. We were watching a bunch of street cleaners at a big event in Glasgow, 12 of them going down the street and it looked great. That’s where the concept came from. Luke did a thing swinging from the ceiling of a club in Brighton with Cook. We realised all these pieces could fit together. Luke is the percussion master and I have often been the outside eye looking for light and shade, asking how do you make repetitive rhythms into a piece of theatre? And trying to stop it just being a group of self-indulgent drummers. The first show at the Assembly Rooms in Edinburgh cost us £8,000 to put on. We paid for it by making music for adverts, bizarrely we ended up doing a whole load in the US for Hershey’s Kisses chocolate. We lost all the money, obviously, because we didn’t have an audience. But there was a kind of punk energy to it and there was a lack of group productions at the time. It was the rise of alternative standup comedy – which Luke’s brother Addison was a key player in – and the time was ripe for a new ensemble piece. We got booked to go to three festivals in Australia and I remember being in Sydney thinking: this is not going to work. But when we got to Adelaide it started snowballing. There was a buzz we weren’t expecting at all and it went absolutely crazy. Bob Dylan came to see us and stood at the back wearing a hoodie.I think we have done the show in about 50 countries. When the pandemic shut us down, I calculated that for 26 years we had always had a show on somewhere in the world. At our peak in the 90s we had six shows running simultaneously; now we’ve got two in the US – one in New York, one touring, and a company in Europe who play everywhere. I’ve watched the show all over the world and you realise that while rhythm is universal, so too is humour. It’s very knockabout, physical humour based on one-upmanship and that’s something everyone in the world recognises.

4/12/2022,"Singin’ in the Rain was not exactly conceived as a masterpiece. Arthur Freed, head of the musicals unit at MGM, had a back catalogue of songs – not all of them classics – that he’d co-written for various films at the studio between 1929 and 1939, and had the idea of stringing them together as a song score for a single new musical. Screenwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green were hired to cobble a story around the disparate tunes; Howard Keel, a stolid bass-baritone in the MGM stable who had acquitted himself respectably in Annie Get Your Gun, was pencilled in as the lead. As a producer, Freed tended to alternate artistically ambitious prestige musicals – just one week before Singin’ in the Rain premiered, he picked up a best picture Oscar for Vincente Minnelli’s ravishing, Gershwin-scored pop ballet An American in Paris – with cheerful, brightly disposable filler. (Remember Pagan Love Song? The Belle of New York? No?) At the outset, one might have expected the sketchily contrived Singin’ in the Rain to fall firmly on the B-list. But that would have been reckoning without Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, at that point something of a dream team for Freed and MGM. Their first film as a director-choreographer duo, the sailors-on-leave romp On the Town, had elevated its featherweight material with visual wit and restless movement; separately, Donen had brought fleet-footed flash to his direction of the Fred Astaire vehicle Royal Wedding, while Kelly’s stardom had reached a peak with An American in Paris. When production on the latter wrapped, making Kelly available, the script for Singin’ in the Rain was passed on to him. Changes were made. The rest, as they say, is history. History, of course, takes time to take shape. Back in 1952, Freed would probably have been surprised to learn that Singin’ in the Rain, rather than An American in Paris, would eventually become the most canonised of all Hollywood musicals – the one routinely cited even by non-acolytes of the genre as one of the greatest films ever made. (In the last four editions of Sight & Sound’s decennial critics’ poll, it has consistently been the highest-scoring musical, twice placing in the all-time top 10.) Upon its release, however, it wasn’t treated as any kind of milestone. Reviews and box office were good if not phenomenal; the Academy, having lavished six Oscars on An American in Paris the year before, gave Singin’ in the Rain a scant two nominations. (Even the Globes handed their best musical award to the drab Susan Hayward vehicle With a Song in My Heart instead.) Watching it 70 years later, you can see why an industry then preoccupied with prestige and television-beating spectacle took time to give the film due respect. Nothing about Singin’ in the Rain announces itself as Art, or even as a grand event: it’s a film so light on its feet as to make its genre-melding entertainment look deceptively easy. The script shuffles warm romantic comedy, breezy Hollywood satire and fanciful Broadway reverie with casual speed, never straining for punchlines or pathos; there’s occasionally a jukebox carelessness to the song placements that fits with the film’s general insouciance. Squint slightly at the screen, and you can see the sweet, amusing, throwaway B-musical this might have been, given duller casting and a little less directorial care. But then, just as you’re settling into the film’s sunny, effortless groove – wondering, amid your pleasure, if it’s maybe a notch less masterful than you remembered or had been told – Donen and Kelly hit you with a shot of pure lightning-in-a-bottle magic. It’s surprisingly slow to start as a musical: the film’s first full-scale musical number comes nearly half an hour in, with Donald O’Connor’s silly-putty physicality making a stunning gymnastics act of the frothy Make ’Em Laugh – one of only two new songs composed for the film, and a shameless knockoff of Cole Porter’s Be a Clown at that. You don’t need musical freshness with that dynamism in the delivery. It’s only getting warmed up. The romantic overture You Were Meant for Me is given a staging of heart-stopping romanticism, wedged between all the film’s daffy farce. An empty soundstage, bathed in artificial cotton-candy twilight, furnished with only a ladder – a sparse playground for the swoony effects of Kelly’s choreography. And yet this too is overshadowed by the film’s genuinely iconic centrepiece, the single number without which, for all its other marshmallowy delights, Singin’ in the Rain wouldn’t be nearly so enduringly remembered. (What would it even be titled, for starters?) A studio streetscape, drenched in artificial rain; a lamppost turned dance partner; Kelly more limber than any man has ever been in a sodden tweed suit. It’s hardly the film’s most effortful set piece: far more manpower, hoofing and production design went into the film’s extended Broadway Melody pitch sequence, with its shifting sets, twirling banners of fabric and steamy, leggy Cyd Charisse cameo. Yet that lengthy number isn’t the first, second or even tenth thing you remember about Singin’ in the Rain; its arbitrary purpose and placement in proceedings functioned as a clever meta-commentary on the ramshackle storytelling of the standard Hollywood musical, making its lavish conception somewhat deliberately self-defeating. It’s certainly no match for a single dancer humming a tune and splashing boyishly in a puddle, and perhaps that was the point. Set in the late 1920s, the film depicts a Hollywood in a state of transition, throwing everything at the screen to survive as silents gave way to talkies. Meanwhile, its sendup of panic-driven production excess was timely in 1952. The studios’ fixation with supersized widescreen epics, aimed at combating the threat of the small screen, began to bleed into the humble musical, changing the shape of the genre to what would eventually become the gargantuan form of 1960s blockbusters like My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music. (Freed, tellingly, would win one more best picture Oscar in the 1950s, for the hyper-decorated frou-frou excess of Gigi.) In its shuffling, unfused way, however, Singin’ in the Rain called on Hollywood to cool their jets, take a breath and appreciate simpler showmanship: a little dance, a little laugh, a little romance, a little rough weather. It might not have seemed a very big deal at the time. But it’s reached 70 with nary a wrinkle.",Arts/Film,Singin’ in the Rain at 70: Hollywood’s show-stopping musical remains a winner,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/11/singin-in-the-rain-gene-kelly-stanley-donen-classic
4/12/2022,"Four years have passed since Napoli “lost a Scudetto in the hotel”. That was how Maurizio Sarri explained things after his then team was thrashed 3-0 by Fiorentina in April 2018, effectively ending their title bid. They had begun the weekend with hopes of going top of the table but suffered an emotional collapse after watching Juventus come from behind to beat Inter the night before. The Bianconeri trailed that game as late as the 87th minute, despite playing with an extra man for more than an hour. They should have gone down to 10 themselves when Miralem Pjanic, already booked, leapt knee-first into Rafinha at the start of the second-half. Instead, an own goal from Milan Skriniar allowed them back into the match and Gonzalo Higuaín snatched a winner at the death. To the Napoli players watching on televisions in Florence, it felt like a dagger to the heart. One week earlier, they had beaten Juventus in Turin, closing to within a point of first. Inter’s lead had dangled the prospect of an opportunity to overtake. For Higuaín, their former teammate, to snatch it away, felt especially cruel. Mathematically, the title race was far from over. Napoli could maintain the one-point gap by beating Fiorentina, and Juventus’s remaining three games included a daunting trip to Roma. But in Sarri’s telling, the dream ended with Higuaín’s strike. He saw players “crying on the stairs” as he made his way up to bed. There were echoes of that story this weekend as Napoli prepared to face Fiorentina. Just like in 2018, Napoli found themselves a single point from Serie A’s summit. An impressive, and essential, 3-1 win away to Atalanta in the previous round lent fresh fuel to the Scudetto dream. Just like four years ago, they were forced to watch a title rival play before them. Inter started the weekend three points behind Napoli but with a game in hand. Their 2-0 win over Verona on Saturday effectively raised them above the Partenopei into second; they hold the head-to-head tie-breaker. Right place, right time 👊Nicolas Gonzalez gets to the rebound and smashes it past the keeper.Fiorentina lead 1-0. pic.twitter.com/FG4S02Iw2d The emotional impact of that result could hardly be the same as Juventus’s win in 2018. Despite wobbly recent form, Inter were clear favourites at home to mid-table opposition. Still, the result did reinforce the need for Napoli to respond with a win of their own. Luciano Spalletti has brought them closer to the summit than any manager since Sarri, but he deflected a question on Saturday about whether he had done enough to earn a Scudetto. “The ones who deserve it most would be Napoli’s supporters,” said Spalletti, adding that a full Stadio Diego Armando Maradona – possible for the first time this season with relaxation of Italy’s Covid laws – could be “the missing piece of the puzzle”. He might be looking at the picture on the jigsaw box backwards. If Napoli do miss out on the title again, they will not have lost it in a hotel this time but rather in their very own home. They had already suffered four league defeats in Naples, and Sunday became their fifth. Fiorentina took the lead in the 29th minute through Nicolás González, gave up an equaliser to Dries Mertens after half-time but then roared back to win with further goals from Jonathan Ikoné and Arthur Cabral. Three goals, just like in 2018. Not even a spectacular late strike from Victor Osimhen could rescue Napoli from fate. The result was a fair reflection of the match. Napoli did start brightly, Osimhen sending a header narrowly off target and having another goal disallowed for offside, but Fiorentina came to control the midfield and punished moments of sloppiness. Kalidou Koulibaly, whose last-man foul on Giovanni Simeone marked the beginning of the collapse four years ago, was at fault again, appealing for a free-kick when he ought to have been closing González down. In the second half, the visitors targeted Napoli’s right-back Alessandro Zanoli, making just his second senior start. Ikoné, on as a substitute, barely had time to take his first touch before firing a shot through the 21-year-old’s legs and into the bottom corner. Zanoli was caught too high up the pitch as Napoli countered down his side again for Cabral’s winner. It was a day to celebrate the work of Fiorentina’s manager, Vincenzo Italiano, whose team finished the weekend in seventh. The January sale of Dusan Vlahovic was supposed to derail the Viola’s European ambitions. Instead, they have collected 17 points from nine games without the Serbian and are 23 better off than they were at the corresponding point last season. Italiano has achieved these results by avoiding overreliance on any one player. His Fiorentina team also won 5-2 away to Napoli in the Coppa Italia at the start of this year. All eight of their goals across the two games had a different scorer. Even so, questions must be asked of Napoli, who have played as well as anyone in Serie A this season and yet faltered in front of their own fans. They could have been leading the title race if they had not drawn with Inter and lost to Milan in Naples over the past two months. In between was a 4-2 defeat to Barcelona – more comprehensive than the scoreline suggests – with whom they drew with at the Camp Nou. Domestically, Napoli have not beaten a top-half team at home since they thumped Lazio in November. It is tempting to wonder whether Spalletti’s intense rhetoric has hindered them. Before the Barcelona defeat, he invoked Maradona, cheering the team on from heaven. Ahead of the loss to Milan, he told his players they must decide whether they wanted to be “immortal” or “quickly forgotten”. Might some players have been better served by defusing the pressure instead of raising it? In more tangible terms, we can ask whether he is getting his tactics right. Osimhen has endured another injury-disrupted season, and Napoli’s position might look different if he had been available throughout, but too often there seems to be disconnect between him and the rest of the team. He touched the ball only 28 times on Sunday, and still produced a goal and an assist. A midfield that was a strength earlier in the season has lost its way – with Piotr Zielinski a shadow of himself. Lorenzo Insigne had a chance to make this season a glorious send-off before leaving for Toronto but has offered little. Empoli 0-0 Spezia, Inter 2-0 Verona, Cagliari 1-2 Juventus,  Genoa 1-4 Lazio, Napoli 2-3 Fiorentina, Sassuolo 2-1 Atalanta, Venezia 1-2 Udinese, Roma 2-1 Salernitana, Torino 0-0 Milan Spalletti described defeat on Sunday as “a bit of a sentence”, suggesting that time was running shor. That was before the leaders, Milan, drew with Torino. The gap to first is only two points but Inter have a chance to claim top spot if they can win their game in hand against Bologna. If Napoli do fall short, there will be other games they look back on with greater regret . Losses at home to Empoli and Spezia feel more damning than to an upwardly-mobile Fiorentina. Even so, those four-year-old echoes linger. “If I could replay any one match from my career, it would be the Fiorentina-Napoli game from 2018,” said the former Napoli keeper Pepe Reina. “That team deserved more.” They pushed on, all the same to a club-record 91 points. At best, Napoli can end this campaign with 84. That could be enough, but feels like a distant target for a team that cannot get comfortable in its own home.",Sport/Football,Home discomforts and Fiorentina damage Napoli’s hopes of the Scudetto | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/11/napoli-scudetto-hopes-fiorentina-football
4/12/2022,"Maryland has become the 15th US state to allow health professionals other than doctors to carry out abortions, as part of a bill expanding access to reproductive rights for women. Under the new law, midwives, senior nurses and trained doctor’s assistants will be authorised to perform medical abortions from 1 July. The bill also directs the state to ring-fence $3.5m a year for abortion-care training. The bill was vetoed by the Republican governor, Larry Hogan, but approved on Saturday with substantial majorities in the state house and senate. Hogan claimed in an open letter the bill would “endanger the health and lives of women” and “set back standards for women’s health care and safety”. There is no evidence that allowing advanced clinicians to provide abortion care in states including California, New Mexico, Colorado, Illinois and New Hampshire has led to lower standards. The law, which may face legal challenge from anti-choice groups, also requires most insurance companies to cover the cost of an abortion at no cost to the patient. The average cost of an abortion is $500 but costs vary widely across the US and can be much higher when accounting for travel and days off work. The Maryland legislation comes amid a surge in bills in Republican-run states seeking to severely restrict or ban access to abortion. Last week, a young woman was jailed in Texas after being accused of causing the “death of an individual by self-induced abortion”. Lizelle Herrera, 26 and from Starr county, was released on Sunday after charges were dropped amid widespread condemnation. Lawyers and rights groups warned that the incident would have a chilling effect for women, even though the current law in Texas explicitly exempts women from being criminalised for any self-managed abortion. Research suggests that hundreds if not thousands of women in Texas have been forced to cross state lines to access abortion care since the state enacted an almost total ban last year. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research group, lawmakers in 19 states approved a record-breaking 108 abortion restrictions in 2021 – more than any other year since the 1973 Roe v Wade supreme court ruling which established the right to abortion. By the end of March 2022, 529 restrictions had been introduced across 41 states. The supreme court is poised to severely weaken or overturn Roe later this year. In 2017, Maryland became the first state to pass legislation guaranteeing funding for Planned Parenthood, the country’s largest abortion provider, regardless of federal cuts.",News/US news,Maryland expands abortion access as lawmakers override Republican governor,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/11/maryland-abortion-republican-governor-larry-hogan
4/12/2022,"Russian forces pounded the north-eastern city of Kharkiv with heavy shelling over the weekend, killing at least 10 civilians. The airport in Dnipro, further south, was destroyed by Russian air strikes on Sunday. Russia’s defence ministry claimed it had destroyed a S-300 anti-aircraft missile system there. In Mariupol on the coast, 213 civilians were evacuated on Sunday through humanitarian corridors, according to Ukraine’s deputy prime minister. And Ukraine’s prosecutor general claimed a total of 1,222 bodies had been found in the region around the capital, Kyiv. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
4/12/2022,"Children think farm animals deserve to be treated as well as human beings but lose this belief in adolescence, a groundbreaking study has found. Researchers from the universities of Exeter and Oxford asked a group of British children aged nine to 11, young adults aged 18 to 21 and older men and women about their attitudes to different sorts of animals. In general, the children said farm animals and human beings should be treated the same and found eating animals less morally acceptable than both sets of adults. The findings suggest that “speciesism” – a moral hierarchy that gives different value to different animals – is learned during adolescence, according to the study. “Humans’ relationship with animals is full of ethical double standards,” said the lead author, Luke McGuire, a lecturer at the University of Exeter who specialises in social and moral development. “Some animals are beloved household companions, while others are kept in factory farms for economic benefit. Judgments seem to largely depend on the species of the animal in question: dogs are our friends, pigs are food.” The report says an important aspect of the human mind is “moral acrobatics”: people can hold ethical values that contradict each other and employ moral double standards. But the origins of moral acrobatics relating to animals is poorly understood and the researchers say this new study provides some of the first evidence examining the differences in how children and adults think about animal treatment. Among other tasks, participants in the study were presented with pictures including a farm animal and companion animals and asked to categorise them as “food”, “pet” or “object”. They were asked how animals were treated, and how they should be treated. Children did not judge all animals to be equal. They concluded, in fact, that dogs ought to be treated better than pigs – but also that pigs ought not to be treated differently from humans. The two sets of adult groups said pigs ought to be treated less well than dogs, while humans and dogs ought to be treated the same. McGuire said the study suggests that while children think farm animals and humans ought to be treated equally well, by adulthood people believe that companion animals and humans ought to be treated better. He said children rated eating animals as significantly less permissible than young adults and adults did. “Something seems to happen in adolescence, where that early love for animals becomes more complicated and we develop more speciesism,” said McGuire. “It’s important to note that even adults in our study thought eating meat was less morally acceptable than eating animal products like milk. So aversion to animals – including farm animals – being harmed does not disappear entirely.” McGuire said that while adjusting attitudes was a natural part of growing up, the “moral intelligence of children” could be valuable. He said: “If we want people to move towards more plant-based diets for environmental reasons, we have to disrupt the current system somewhere. For example, if children ate more plant-based food in schools, that might be more in line with their moral values, and might reduce the normalisation towards adult values that we identify in this study.” The paper, published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, is titled “The development of speciesism: age-related differences in the moral view of animals”.",News/World news,"Farm animals and humans should be treated the same, children say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/farm-animals-and-humans-should-be-treated-the-same-children-say
4/12/2022,"This Friday sees the beginning of Passover. It’s the liberation story of the Jewish people: the journey from slavery to freedom. I’m sitting in my dressing room – the “Isherwood room”, named after the writer whose Berlin Stories gave birth to our production of Cabaret – with 10 extraordinarily liberated people. There are more pierced nipples and “wearable erotic accessories” in here than this sheltered man from Muswell Hill could shake a stick at. So, I keep my painfully heteronormative stick to myself. A few seats away sits my friend Matt who plays Hans in the show, a specialist in obscure sexual practices: art and life have never been more attuned. He’s wearing lederhosen and glitter, polishing some sort of leather harness. “What’s that for?” I ask. “I’m going to a club after this evening’s show, where I’m strapped on to a swing and penetrated throughout the night.” “Wow,” I say. “How extraordinary.” “Not really, mate. For me it’s just like shaking hands.” Well, buckle up Matt and let me tell you about the time I escaped from the original “house of bondage” three and a half thousand years ago. On Passover, Jews relive the exodus from Egypt as if it were happening to us now. We don’t just tell the story, we reenact it. We gather for the Seder night and recount through story, food and song our escape from slavery under the Pharaoh – our “deliverance from the house of bondage to the promised land”. It’s biblical cosplay – with matzah. That’s the unleavened bread we eat to remind ourselves that we had to flee Egypt in the dead of night – without time for the bread to rise – before the Pharaoh changed his mind. And we eat bitter herbs to remind us of the tears we cried in our anguish as enslaved people. We drink wine to celebrate our escape and spill wine to remind us of the drowning of our enemies in the Red Sea and the plagues they suffered. Emotional paradoxes are a Jewish tradition. Laughter needs tears. Happiness always needs its opposing corollary. Is it an injunction or just superstition that makes us eschew unadulterated joy? Even during a wedding ceremony, at the very moment of unity, a glass is smashed to remind us of the destruction of the temple (in our production of Cabaret, there is a further link to Kristallnacht). But the Seder story makes another crucial antithetical connection, which has become part of the Jewish intellectual DNA: hope shares centre stage with caution. We recite from the Haggadah: “Not just Pharaoh, but in every generation there are those who rise against us to annihilate us” and every year we marvel at the pessimistic prescience of the third-century sages who wrote it. If fearing the worst is a tribal habit, drummed into us at every Passover, then the loss of that fear has also become part of our collective cautionary tale telling. My character in Cabaret, the Jewish greengrocer, Herr Schultz, like so many of his generation, assumes that the superstitious injunction to be fearful of despots no longer applies in the enlightened world of Germany. He refuses to acknowledge the growing danger. His hope that the Nazi threat will pass is not counterbalanced by the ancient tribal command to fear the worst. He shrugs off his friend Clifford’s advice to leave, and “dramatic irony” – the audience’s gift of hindsight – allows us to assume the worst fate befalls him. To have hope and ignore its lurking shadow is not a recipe in the Jewish cookbook. But if the Seder is a sort of preparedness drill, an annual escape dress-rehearsal, then the message is not lost on us this year. As we were rehearsing and discussing Schultz’s naive optimism, the thought of a Russian invasion would be dismissed as alarmism, even though Putin’s troops were amassing on the border. Ukrainians went about their daily business. Greengrocers sold their fruit. Weeks later, and the booby-trapped bodies of Bucha make the 10 plagues of the Passover story seem tame. Unimaginable horrors are being perpetrated by the capricious hand of this generation’s Pharaoh. And we are unprepared. Hope has lost its bedfellow. The Passover Seder is an evening of paradoxes. It is prophetic and discomforting, while also a joyous meal of celebration and ancient drinking games. Wine is drunk leaning to the left to mimic Roman aristocrats and glasses must be filled, finished, and refilled according to a set plan that no one has ever agreed on. We even have an extra cup of wine for Elijah the prophet: we open the front door and sing a song to welcome in Eliyahu Hanavi – the eternally wandering Jew, the forever refugee, the stranger in a strange land – to seek asylum in our home. Children stare at the glass to see if he has taken a sip while the adults gently knock the table. But Elijah isn’t just a Jewish Santa to keep the kids awake. Yes, he is the bringer of good news and joy but also the spectre at the feast. As the door opens, we feel the chill wind of reality. Elijah speaks for all of Earth’s wanderers, all those looking for shelter. With millions of Ukrainians fleeing war, his arrival is salutary. Today’s exodus doesn’t require historical reenactment at the Seder meal. It is playing out in real time and despite the thousands of people signing up to host refugees, scandalously few have made it to a place of greater safety. This year, maybe because my character Herr Schultz failed to escape, I will be thinking about a man who succeeded. A Ukrainian, also called Elijah, who listened to the ancestral warning of Passover and made the decision to flee his home town of Kyiv, after two of his brothers were killed because a new despot had arisen with a taste for violence, just like the Pharaoh. He was lucky enough to find asylum in the UK. But, however current his story sounds, this was a long time ago. Elijah Zivatovsky of Kyiv was my grandfather. There is an exodus in every generation. So, when we open the door during the Seder meal for Elijah the prophet we welcome in the original time-traveller. He comes from another time to shake us out of our docility and acquiescence. He enters the party like an embodiment of relativity. The personification of history repeating itself. Here to unsettle us and call us to action. Can we call ourselves free if others are still in bondage?’ I notice that Matt has stopped his polishing. “Fascinating stuff, Elliot. Seder night sounds like a lot of fun.” “Why don’t you join us on Friday after the show, if you’re not too tied up?” “I’ll be there with knobs on,” says Matt.

4/12/2022,"It’s some feat bringing corpse paint to the mainstream, but Ghost have done it: the Swedes arrive for the opening night of their first UK tour in three years having seen their new album Impera reach No 2 in the charts last month. The band’s identities were once totally secret, and although the rest remain anonymous – referred to as Nameless Ghouls, and wearing headgear that’s part steampunk, part Tom Hardy’s Bane – Ghost are a less mysterious proposition now that the theatrical Tobias Forge is known as their frontman. Not that this has had any impact on their symphonic, pop-savvy metal. What started as a doomy occult band has morphed into a blockbusting arena act, like a spooky Def Leppard without the flowing locks. We’re two songs in and the prescient Rats already has a packed arena in raptures. Released pre-pandemic, Forge sings: “In times of turmoil, in times like these / Beliefs contagious, spreading disease.” Remove the driving guitar chugs from Spillways and in another lifetime it could be an Abba staple, such is its outrageously catchy chorus – that plinking piano opening surely a tribute to Mamma Mia from their fellow Swedes. “Do you like a lot of oomph?” Forge enquires, before the band launch into Mummy Dust. Its zany keytar solo isn’t fooling anyone: with hulking, Metallica-esque riffs, this is Ghost’s heaviest song. On the moody Cirice, Forge slinks across the stage wearing bat wings, before funereal stomper Square Hammer inspires the most frenzied singalong of the night. There are confetti cannon, costume changes, flamethrowers and other forms of pyro, but the band is self-aware, preventing proceedings from ever getting too cartoonish. As one of the three guitarists relishes a solo spot on From the Pinnacle to the Pit a little much for his liking, Forge playfully reprimands them with a wagging finger; this is pantomime as much as rock’n’roll. Ghost have often delved into history for thematic fare – 2018’s Prequelle drew on the Black Death, Impera from Victorian empires – but they’ve always seemed one step ahead during their sensational, transatlantic rise. Forge has said that he’s already decided the title of Ghost’s next album; one only hopes that he’s not forgetting to take all of this in, because his band have something magnificent to offer in the present.",Arts/Music,Ghost review – rock’n’roll pyro pantomime is hellishly good fun,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/11/ghost-review-rocknroll-pyro-pantomime-is-hellishly-good-fun
4/12/2022,"Downing Street has conceded that it cannot say whether any other ministers or their spouses have or have previously held non-dom tax status, or whether Boris Johnson will take any steps to find this out. It came as Keir Starmer called on Boris Johnson to “bring this saga to a close” and say whether any other ministers had taken such efforts to reduce their tax bills. No 10 has confirmed that Christopher Geidt, the independent adviser on ministers’ interests, is to examine the interests and declarations of Rishi Sunak, after the chancellor requested this to happen. Johnson’s deputy spokesperson said that while the inquiry would look into declarations about the non-dom tax status of Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, it would not necessarily look at Sunak’s decision to maintain a US green card for a period as an MP and minister. After it emerged that Murty does not pay UK tax on overseas earnings – which she has since agreed to do – the health secretary and former chancellor, Sajid Javid, said he had also held non-dom status for six years while he worked as a banker. Asked if they could confirm that no other ministers or spouses were in the same position, the spokesperson said: “Ministers are required to make the relevant transparency declaration, but it wouldn’t be for me as an individual to know someone’s personal tax arrangements. “The relevant transparency declarations are made. Some of those are made public, but where it can relate to private tax information, sometimes that isn’t made public, for the reason that it is private tax information.” Asked if Johnson would now try to find out whether any ministers had formerly been non-doms – MPs and peers are barred from having the status – or any spouses still had it, the spokesperson said they did not know. In a statement on Monday, Starmer said: “To appoint one chancellor with suspect tax affairs is sloppy, to appoint two is a habit.” The Labour leader added: “Boris Johnson needs to bring this saga to a close and confirm that no other sitting Conservative minister is doing or has done anything to reduce their own personal tax bill, while they preside over the biggest tax hike in 70 years.” Starmer has asked for answers within 24 hours on whether any minister had used non-dom status, benefited from offshore trusts or had other links to tax havens, or used tax minimisation schemes subsequently condemned by HMRC. Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Johnson said he had not known about Murty’s tax status. Asked if the prime minister knew Sunak had held a green card allowing him US residency, the spokesperson said: “I haven’t asked him with regards to the green card. But it’s not a requirement to provide that information to the prime minister.” They added that they did not know if Geidt’s inquiry would look into the green card issue. On Sunday, Sunak wrote to Johnson to formally ask that the prime minister refer his financial arrangements and declarations to Geidt. This had now happened, the spokesperson said: “I’m not aware of whether Lord Geidt himself has begun his work, but I can confirm that the prime minister has agreed to the request from the chancellor for Lord Geidt to undertake this work.” The results would be published “in a timely manner”, they added. Earlier, the environment secretary, George Eustice, said he had never held non-dom status but could not speak for any colleagues. Asked if he knew whether other ministers might come forward, Eustice said on Sky News: “Well I don’t, all I can tell you, as I said, I’m not the accountant for my ministerial colleagues in cabinet, I don’t know anybody who may or may not have had non-dom status. I can tell you that I never have and would never seek to have one.” Eustice said he was confident Sunak had done the right thing. “The man who is chancellor at the moment has paid all of his taxes and paid taxes on his income and declared all of that in the UK and he’s been clear about that,” he said. On Sunday, Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, wrote to Johnson and Geidt seeking answers on issues including whether Sunak had benefited from the use of tax havens, and whether his status as a green card holder while an MP and minister meant he had been legally a permanent US resident",News/Politics,No 10 unable to confirm whether other ministers have non-dom status,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/11/other-ministers-may-have-held-non-dom-status-but-i-never-would-says-george-eustice-rishi-sunak
4/12/2022,"A man has been convicted at the Old Bailey of the terrorist assassination of the Conservative MP Sir David Amess. Ali Harbi Ali, 26, stabbed Amess to death on 15 October 2021, fuelled by Islamic State propaganda and having spent at least two years researching which MP to murder. Ali was being radicalised in 2014 at the same time he was going through Prevent, the official UK anti-radicalisation scheme. The Guardian understands that in 2015, while Ali was becoming an adherent of terrorist violence, Prevent assessed he did not pose a significant danger of terrorist violence and his case was closed. Amess died barely an hour after the attack at a church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, as he held an advice surgery for those from his Southend West constituency. Ali was arrested at the scene having posed as a constituent to gain an appointment. He told police after his arrest that he supported IS and he picked Amess whose constituency surgery details, including location and time, were advertised online. Amess, 69, was stabbed 21 times and died in the church, before paramedics could get him to hospital. The jury at the Old Bailey in central London convicted Ali of the murder of Amess and planning other attacks against MPs after under 20 minutes of deliberation. He refused to stand as the unanimous verdicts were delivered. Ali, from Kentish town, north London, took a train to Essex and booked an appointment at the constituency surgery with the sole aim of killing Amess. He lied to Amess’s aides that he had recently moved to Essex. Once in the room with Amess, Ali received a call, said sorry, stood up and pulled a knife from his pocket and began a frenzied knife attack. As Amess lay dying, Ali sent a note from his phone justifying his actions to his WhatsApp contacts and stayed in the church. He did not try to attack anyone else, despite ample time and opportunity. A man who entered the church just after the stabbing saw Ali standing holding a knife in his right hand, saying: “I want to kill David, I want them all to die.” Ali was on the phone and the witness could hear a female voice saying: “What have you done?”, to which Ali replied that he had done it because of Syria and that he wanted to be shot and killed. The man asked Ali why he had done it and he replied: “I wanted to kill David and every MP who voted for bombings in Syria, I wanted to die, be shot and be a hero.” After his arrest Ali told police he wanted officers to shoot him and had rushed towards them. Instead, once he realised the first officers on the scene were unarmed, he heeded their command to drop his knife. He had planned an attack for two years, since May 2019, supposedly angered by western actions in Syria. He had carried out reconnaissance on other MPs, even scouting the home of Michael Gove. He loitered around the Houses of Parliament on several occasions looking for a chance to strike. Counter-terrorism officials believe he acted alone. Ali had visited the north London constituency office of Mike Freer MP and been spotted peering in through a window. Searches of his electronic devices showed research on MPs including Dominic Raab; the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, and Ben Wallace. Amess’s killing sparked shock and outrage as well as a review of MPs’ security. He was known as a diligent constituency MP with 38 years in parliament. The jury was told the murder was “an attack on democracy”. The issue of whether the level of danger Ali posed was properly assessed may be an issue for the inquest into Amess’s death, expected at a future date. Once Ali was referred to Prevent, he was assessed as being of sufficient concern that he was seen by the Channel programme – reserved for those at greatest risk of radicalisation. Police and security sources have given little detail about his involvement with Prevent, which was first revealed by the Guardian. Each year a small proportion of the thousands referred to Prevent are then referred on to the Channel programme for more intensive support. DCS Dominic Murphy said after the verdicts: “He spent some time in Prevent and then came out of Prevent and by his own admission, carried on his activity in secret over many years, forming his plan and conducting reconnaissance and focusing his efforts on many MPs.” A government commissioned review of Prevent is expected to be published this month or next. Ali will be sentenced on Wednesday and the Crown may ask the court to impose a whole-life tariff, meaning he will never be released. Mr Justice Sweeney said the jury had faced harrowing evidence and excused them from jury duty for a decade, adding: “This is the sort of case none of us will ever forget.”",News/UK news,Ali Harbi Ali guilty of murdering MP David Amess in terrorist attack,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/david-amess-verdict-terrorist-attack-ali-harbi-ali-guilty
4/12/2022,"The Conservative Sir David Amess, 69, was one of the longest-serving MPs, having first been elected for Basildon in 1983 and then for Southend West in 1997. A long-term Eurosceptic, he supported Brexit in the 2016 EU referendum and tweeted a picture of a lifesize cardboard cutout of Margaret Thatcher on the day the UK left the European Union. A father of five, he was born in Plaistow, Essex and became a primary school teacher in Bethnal Green, east London after graduating in economics and government from what is now Bournemouth University. He later became a recruitment consultant. On Monday, Ali Harbi Ali, 26 was convicted at the Old Bailey of his murder and plotting to attack other MPs, including Michael Gove. Initially elected as a councillor to the London borough of Redbridge, after winning the Basildon seat Amess served as parliamentary private secretary to Michael Portillo for 10 years. When, against the odds, he held the marginal Basildon seat in 1992, it was the first clear demonstration that Labour would not win that election. He later wrote a book about his experiences, entitled 1992: Against All Odds, which was launched in the Commons at an event to mark the 20th anniversary of the election. Before the 1997 election, with a boundary review dividing Basildon, he was selected for Southend West. Amess’s ambition from the age of 11 was to become an MP. Although he did not serve as a minister, or hold positions as a Conservative spokesperson, he was well known for his campaigning from the backbenches. Issues close to his heart included animal welfare, and he was one of the few Tory MPs in favour of a foxhunting ban. Fuel poverty was another area he had been active in addressing. While serving on the health select committee from 1998 until 2007 he campaigned on various issues, including obesity and endometriosis. A devout Catholic, Amess had been described as one of parliament’s most dedicated anti-abortion activists. He was knighted in the 2015 new year honours list for political and public service. Most of his campaigning efforts in recent years were associated with the Essex coastal town he represented, including his long-running campaign to make Southend a city. In December 2019, he secured an adjournment debate in the Commons specifically on the topic, telling MPs: “I am not messing about. We have got it from the prime minister that Southend is going to become a city – and it will become a city.” A proposed marina and the airport were among his supporting arguments. He saw the Queen’s platinum jubilee in 2022 as another opportunity, asking in November 2020 for a new statue of the Queen and for a city status competition to ensure Southend got the recognition he believed it deserved. Another campaign he supported was for a memorial to Dame Vera Lynn on the white cliffs of Dover. Addressing a short debate on the future of Southend hospital in 2017, he spoke of the “rudeness” he experienced during that year’s election campaign. “The things that people now say, young, middle-age or old, to we the politicians, who take the blame for decisions of bureaucrats and others who are paid twice as much as we are, frankly, but the way they can use the word F, C and all the rest of it disgusts me,” he said. Amess recently wrote of how MPs had received security advice about holding surgeries, and how attacks had “spoilt the great British tradition” of the voters meeting politicians. In Ayes & Ears: A Survivor’s Guide to Westminster, which was published in November, he wrote about Jo Cox’s murder in 2016 and how she had been attacked “in the most barbaric fashion imaginable”, and about the 2000 sword attack on Nigel Jones MP, which resulted in the death of Jones’s aide Andy Pennington as he tried to protect him. “We all make ourselves readily available to our constituents and are often dealing with members of the public who have mental health problems. It could happen to any of us,” Amess wrote. “We regularly check our locks and many others have CCTV cameras installed, but probably the most significant change has been with constituency surgeries.” Amess and his wife, Julia, who is a part-time caseworker for her husband, had four daughters and a son. Their eldest daughter, the actor Katie Amess, was critical of her father’s stance on gay rights after he defied his friend David Cameron to vote against same-sex marriage. The MP and his three-year-old French bulldog Vivienne were running in the forthcoming Westminster Dog of the Year Show, which promotes responsible dog ownership. “Every time I walk into the room Vivienne throws herself at me, lies on her back with her legs in the air to be tickled. But before that she always brings a toy so she is of a generous, giving nature,” he told his local newspaper website. He also regularly judged at local dog shows and supported various local animal charities. In 1997, he was duped by Channel 4’s satirical programme Brass Eye into asking a question in parliament about the made-up drug “cake”.",News/UK news,Sir David Amess profile: Eurosceptic MP with a passion for animal welfare,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/15/sir-david-amess-eurosceptic-mp-passion-animal-welfare
4/12/2022,"The actor Sam Elliott has apologised for comments he made last month about Jane Campion’s western The Power of the Dog. While speaking with Marc Maron on the latter’s WTF podcast, Elliott had described the film as a “piece of shit” western with “allusions of homosexuality”. Elliott, 77, compared the cowboy characters in the film to male strippers and questioned New Zealander Campion’s credentials in making the movie: “What the fuck does this woman from down there know about the American west?” Speaking on Sunday during an event for Deadline, Elliott claimed that he had told Maron “Campion was a brilliant director” but went on to say he wanted to “apologise to the cast … brilliant actors all. “And in particular Benedict Cumberbatch. I can only say that I’m sorry and I am.” Elliott said that he wanted to discuss the film, but that he “wasn’t very articulate about it”. “And I said some things that hurt people and I feel terrible about that. The gay community has been incredible to me my entire career. Friends on every level and every job description up until today. I’m sorry I hurt any of those friends and someone that I loved. And anyone else by the words that I used.” Reaction to Elliott’s comments was universally contemptuous, with many surprised the actor had apparently failed to realise some films are not shot in their exact settings. Campion later responded to Elliott’s comments: “I think it’s really unfortunate and sad for him because he’s really hit the trifecta of misogyny and xenophobia and homophobia,” she said. “I don’t like that. I think he was being a little bit of a b-i-t-c-h. Plus he’s not a cowboy, he’s an actor.” Cumberbatch, meanwhile, referred obliquely to Elliott’s comments as a “denial that anybody could have any other than a heteronormative existence because of what they do for a living or where they’re born” as indicative of a continued “massive intolerance within the world at large toward homosexuality”.

4/12/2022,"The Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer’s visit to Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday is intended to tell the Russian president that he has “lost the war morally”, Austria’s foreign minister has said, as the EU discusses how to impose sanctions on Russian oil. On a day of brisk diplomatic activity, Nehammer is due to become the first western leader to meet Putin since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. In Luxembourg, EU foreign ministers are discussing how to help Ukraine further, while Joe Biden will hold talks with Narendra Modi, where the US president is expected to press India’s leader not to increase imports of Russian crude. Austria’s foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, said someone needed to tell Putin the truth. “It makes a difference to be face to face and tell him what the reality is: that this president has de facto lost the war morally,” Schallenberg said ahead of the meeting with his EU counterparts. “It should be in his own interest that someone tells him the truth. I think it is important and we owe it to ourselves if we want to save human lives.” Nehammer said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom he met on Saturday, had been informed of his Moscow trip, as had the EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Austria, which is not a member of Nato, is calling for humanitarian corridors, a ceasefire and the full investigation of war crimes. Lithuania’s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, sounded sceptical about further talks with Putin, after a series of high-profile visits by EU leaders failed to deter the Russian leader from launching his attack. He said: “I have seen a lot of effort by many leaders, by Emmanuel Macron, to try and see whether they can talk to the guy. I personally have no reason to believe that he is ‘talkable’.” The visit comes as Zelenskiy warned that Russian troops would move to “even larger operations” in the east of Ukraine. In his nightly video address on Sunday, Zelenskiy also accused Russia of trying to evade responsibility for war crimes. “When people lack the courage to admit their mistakes, apologise, adapt to reality and learn, they turn into monsters. And when the world ignores it, the monsters decide that it is the world that has to adapt to them. Ukraine will stop all this,” he said. Zelenskiy said he had discussed with Scholz how to strengthen sanctions against Russia, adding: “I am glad to note that the German position has recently changed in favour of Ukraine. I consider it absolutely logical.” Russia said on Monday that it had destroyed air defence systems in Ukraine over the weekend, in what appeared to be a renewed push to gain air superiority and take out weapons Kyiv has described as crucial, before a broad new offensive in the east. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said there were “massive indications of war crimes”, adding that while “the courts will have to decide”, it was “central to secure all evidence”. EU ministers met Karim Khan, chief prosector of the international criminal court in The Hague, and Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s chief prosector, who is tasked with overseeing nearly 2,000 cases of war crimes committed by Russian occupying forces. Several ministers confirmed the EU was drawing up further sanctions against Russia, targeting lucrative oil sales, although it remains unclear how quickly the bloc will move in cutting imports of Russian crude. The EU is banning Russian coal from August, but Germany opposes an immediate oil embargo. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, confirmed that the European Commission, which is responsible for the sanctions proposals, was “now working on ensuring that oil is part of the next sanctions package”. “The European Union is spending hundreds of millions of euros on importing oil from Russia, that is certainly contributing to financing this war. We need to cut off that financing,” Coveney said. “The sooner that can happen the better.” The Swedish foreign minister, Ann Linde, said: “I think we might make progress when it comes to oil. We are constantly developing our positions and more countries are understanding how important this is.” The bloc, which imports 27% of its oil from Russia, is likely to argue over the phaseout period. Germany has pledged to phase out Russian coal and oil by the end of the year, but said ending dependence on Russian gas would take until at least 2024. Referring to these plans, Baerbock said: “We need a joint, coordinated plan to completely phase out fossil fuels, to be able to withdraw as a European Union.” The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, deplored the “brutal, brutal aggression of Russian troops against the civilian population”, but declined to elaborate on further EU action against Russia, stating: “sanctions are always on the table.” The US, which has been pressing Berlin to sever Russian energy ties, is expected to make the same argument to India later on Monday. India has not imposed sanctions on Russia. Taking advantage of low prices, India has bought 13m barrels of Russian crude oil since the invasion of Ukraine began, compared with 16m barrels in all of 2021, according to Reuters. Biden has accused India of being the only “somewhat shaky” country on Ukraine in the Quad group of nations, which includes Japan and Australia. “President Biden will continue our close consultations on the consequences of Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine and mitigating its destabilizing impact on global food supply and commodity markets,” the White House said in a statement.

4/12/2022,"When Daniel Wilcox read the tweet ESPN’s Adam Schefter posted to break the news of NFL quarterback Dwayne Haskins’ death, he thought about how some view athletes as mere entertainers without taking the time to see them as human. “When you’re in the NFL, you’re just a piece of meat. You’re a name and you’re a number,” says Wilcox, who played tight end for the New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Baltimore Ravens. Schefter caught backlash after listing Haskins’ career setbacks while reporting on his death, which occurred when the 24-year-old was hit by a truck in the early hours of Saturday morning. “Dwayne Haskins, a standout at Ohio State before struggling to catch on with Washington and Pittsburgh in the NFL, died this morning when he got hit by a car in South Florida, per his agent Cedrick Saunders,” Schefter tweeted. “Haskins has a family, and they’re hurting,” says Wilcox. “You’re pointing out a flaw in someone instead of embracing the fact that someone has just lost their life. There’s a level of insensitivity. With being a reporter, sometimes you want to be the first one to get it out and you don’t think about the people that you affect when you say things.” The sports community spoke out against Schefter’s tweet, which was posted at a time when Haskins’ family, friends, and former teammates were taking in the enormity of his death. Schefter would eventually delete the tweet, but the damage was done. How about “ Dwayne Haskins, son, husband, buckeye brother, friend, beloved teammate has passed away” TF his career ups and downs have to do with him unfortunately losing his life🤦🏾‍♂️ STFU! Let his family & friends grieve instead of throwing shade. Praying for the Haskins family!! pic.twitter.com/gb1D9KcgCQ Athletes such as Dez Bryant, Lamar Jackson, and former Ohio State University quarterback Cardale Jones all lashed out at Schefter on social media with Jones tweeting: “How about ‘Dwayne Haskins, son, husband, buckeye brother, friend, beloved teammate has passed away’ TF his career ups and downs have to do with him unfortunately losing his life.” Haskins was with the Pittsburgh Steelers at the time of his death. Ryan Clark, a former Steelers defensive back who now works with Schefter at ESPN, says the writer has apologized to him directly for the tweet. But, as of Monday morning, Schefter has yet to give a public apology. This is not the first time Schefter has appeared to be more excited about breaking news that thinking about people’s humanity. When a grand jury decided not to indict Deshaun Watson on sexual assault charges earlier this year, Schefter’s tweet read like a PR statement for the quarterback: “This is why Deshaun Watson, from the beginning, welcomed a police investigation: He felt he knew that the truth would come out.” Many pointed out that a failure to indict is not a proclamation of innocence and that Watson is still under investigation by the NFL and in civil lawsuits over allegations of sexual misconduct made by 22 women. On that occasion Schefter apologized for his “poorly worded” tweet. Schefter was not the only person who acted like an NFL scout in the wake of Haskins’ death. Former Dallas Cowboys executive Gil Brandt sounded like he was assessing a college player’s suitability for the NFL rather than speaking about the death of a young man when he appeared on the NFL’s SiriusXM channel. “He was a guy that was living to be dead … Maybe if he stayed in school a year he wouldn’t do silly things [like] jogging on a highway,” Brandt, who subsequently apologized, said. Jason Wright, former NFL running back and president of the Washington Commanders, shared his thoughts on Brandt’s statement by tweeting, “There is a pervasive, trite and false narrative about athletes, especially NFL and NBA, that great athleticism cannot come with great intellect and character. It subjugates men, pushing the idea that they are worth nothing apart from the arena. It has deep roots and it’s harmful.” Beyond the blunders of those in the media, there are notable instances where dehumanization has served as a practice in the NFL. For decades, the NFL used “race-norming,” which assumed that Black players possessed a lower baseline of cognitive abilities. In turn, it was harder for retired Black players to receive compensation based on mental declines linked to their playing days. In response to a lawsuit by former NFL players, the NFL implemented a plan in March to eliminate racial bias in testing and payout. “They don’t want to pay for your health insurance when you’re done,” Wilcox says. “They don’t want to care for your broken bones. They don’t care about your torn ligaments. The surgeries you have while you are playing for them, they don’t care. All they care about is what they can do to get you on the field to help them win. They want you to make them more money and continue to bring in billions of dollars to the organization.” It was left to other athletes and those who knew and loved Haskins to step in and remind us that we didn’t lose a football player this weekend, we lost a person. Steelers linebacker TJ Watt remembered that Haskins “was always making people smile, never taking life for granted.” His head coach Mike Tomlin said that Haskins “was one of our hardest workers, both on the field and in our community” Even Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder, perhaps the least sympathetic figure in the NFL, managed to give Haskins the humanity others could not. “He was a young man with a tremendous amount of potential who had infectious personality. To say we are heartbroken is an understatement,” Snyder and his wife Tanya said in a statement. But it was an athlete from another sport, New York Mets slugger Pete Alonso, who himself was nearly killed in a car accident earlier this year, who reminded us that we are all as vulnerable as Haskins. ""That could have easily been me.""Pete Alonso says when he heard the news of Dewayne Haskins' death today, he flashed back to his car accident last month and how close a call it was for him: pic.twitter.com/qx3jnTgcrY “That could have easily been me,” Alonso said following the Mets game against the Washington Nationals on Saturday. “Everyone that is above ground should be thankful for another day. Life is fragile, but we should all count our blessings if we are on the right side of the dirt. It’s an emotional thing to go through something like that, and I feel so bad for not just [Haskins’] teammates, but also his family.” Alonso was right. Haskins wasn’t just a quarterback.

4/12/2022,"Shanghai authorities will start easing lockdown in some areas on Monday, despite reporting a record of more than 25,000 new Covid cases in the country’s most populous city and one of its most significant financial centres. The metropolis of nearly 26 million people will allow what city official Gu Honghui said was “appropriate activity” in some neighbourhoods where there have been no positive cases for at least two weeks. Residents of these neighbourhoods are not allowed to travel to those still under severe lockdowns. “Each district will announce the specific names of the first batch [of communities],” Gu told a news briefing. It is unclear how many residents stand to have lockdowns immediately eased. On Monday, Shanghai reported a record high combined number of cases for the previous 24 hours, with 914 symptomatic cases and 25,173 asymptomatic. For Saturday, the authorities reported 1,006 cases with symptoms and 23,937 without. Frustration has continued to grow across Shanghai. Online, harrowing tales of residents unable to access medical resources on time have been shared multiple times. Affected residents posted pleas for help with medical facilities and complaints about difficulties in buying food. They ranged from well-connected celebrities to working-class citizens. On Monday, Lang Hsien-ping, a well-known TV pundit, reported on Weibo that his 98-year-old mother had died while waiting for her Covid test results in hospital. According to regulations, patients have to be clear of Covid infections before being able to receive treatment during this period. “My mother left us for ever after waiting four hours (for her Covid test results) at the door of the emergency room,” Lang wrote on Weibo. “I wanted to see her for the last time, but because my neighbourhood has been sealed off, I spent a long time communicating with relevant departments before they allowed me to go to the hospital.” Lang said he was then unable to hail a taxi on the streets because the city was under lockdown, meaning he did not manage to bid farewell to his mother. “It was an avoidable tragedy,” he wrote. Over the weekend, a 19-minute recording of a Shanghai couple being forced to move to a centralised quarantine facility was posted on WeChat. In it, the couple were told by the local centre for disease control (CDC) that they were Covid-positive, but they insisted they were not, as their test reports showed. The exchange ended with the CDC representative threatening to enforce the decision against the couple’s will. As news of Shanghai residents struggling to buy food spreads across China, in recent weeks residents in other provinces have reportedly rushed to stockpile goods. Multiple “survival guides” have been shared on social media in the past few days as people in other parts of China watched the plight of Shanghai with shock. This was certainly the case in my supermarket in Beijing today. There were far more people than normal, and everyone seemed to be filling one or even two carts.https://t.co/CBgZ21dhPm via @scmpnews The situation in Shanghai also prompted other Chinese cities to take a zero-risk approach to Covid. On Monday, the southern city of Guangzhou cancelled in-person classes at elementary and middle schools and shifted them online. The measures were taken after more than a dozen cases were found, and the authorities said they would last for at least a week. On Friday, Dr Zhong Nanshan, the country’s top respiratory diseases expert, criticised the city for its under-preparedness. “The measures for prevention and control [of the Covid outbreak] in Shanghai were not sufficient, and there was insufficient understanding of the transmission characteristics of the Omicron variant,” he was quoted as saying in a university webinar.

4/12/2022,"Ali Harbi Ali’s descent to extremism followed an otherwise unremarkable childhood. Born in Southwark, London, in 1996 to Somali parents, Ali grew up in a three-bedroom 1980s terrace house in Croydon with his mother, two sisters and younger brother. His father, Harbi Ali Kullane, was a former communications adviser to the prime minister of Somalia, who moved to the UK from Mogadishu in the 1990s. Ali’s parents split when he was young and his father began to divide his time between London and east Africa. He is reported to have homes in Mogadishu and Nairobi in Kenya. Ali and his siblings were among the first Muslim families to attend Parish Church junior and infant school in Croydon. Former staff have told reporters how, as a small boy, he would cheerfully join in singing hymns in assembly. He later went to the same secondary school as the model Kate Moss: Riddlesdown Collegiate school in Purley, south London. He is said to have excelled academically in his first five years at the school. He stayed on for A-levels and his intention was to study medicine at university. Friends have told reporters he would spend every break playing football. He was not particularly popular but nor was he a loner, it has been suggested. It was later in his education years that he is said to have taken a turn towards extremist views, and during sixth form, his school work and attendance began to decline. It is now known that he received extensive support under the government’s Channel counter-terrorism programme before his case was closed. He was first referred to Prevent, the early intervention scheme designed to turn people away from the risk of supporting violence, as a teenager in 2014. Each year a small proportion of the thousands referred to Prevent are referred on to the Channel programme for intensive support, overseen by a panel with expertise in deradicalisation and helping those deemed vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism. Both programmes are voluntary and do not involve criminal sanctions. Ali was referred to the Channel scheme while he was at school in 2014 over concerns about him being drawn towards an Islamist ideology. He went through the process and was discharged. He was not believed to be on any of the security services’ watchlists. His A-level results were not as expected: two Ds and an E. It was agreed he would stay at school to resit his examinations. He left school in 2015 having retaken his biology A-level. Later that year, he enrolled at City, University of London for a degree in radiotherapy but records indicate he withdrew from the course on 22 September 2016 for “personal reasons”. He told police he dropped out of university to focus on whether or not he was going to make hijrah – migrate to Muslim lands – or focus on carrying out an act of domestic terrorism. Family and friends have told reporters Ali started to watch extremist videos online, including those posted by the notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary. After his arrest for the murder of David Amess, searches of his mobile phone and laptop devices found plenty of extremist material. Images of terrorist attackers and “inspirational” Islamic State (IS) propaganda images were found. One mobile phone had been used since 2016 to receive messages that appeared to be official IS propaganda and communications via a channel on the encrypted Telegram app. Ali’s father told reporters he was “traumatised” by his son’s actions. Known to international diplomats in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, Kullane was involved in several anti-terrorist campaigns against the jihadist group al-Shabaab while working for the prime minister. Kullane returned to the UK two years ago. He lives with his sister in the north London district of Bounds Green. Ali had been living with an aunt and her sons in a council house in the upmarket north London Kentish Town area, in a street of £2m three-storey townhouses. It emerged Ali had researched attacks on other MPs, including the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove. He had also looked at Mike Freer MP’s website and Wikipedia pages for the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and Richard Fuller MP.",News/UK news,Ali Harbi Ali: an academic high-flyer who fell into extremism,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/ali-harbi-ali-an-academic-high-flyer-who-fell-into-extremism-david-amess
4/12/2022,"More flights were cancelled on Monday as airlines and airports struggled to cope with the big Easter getaway, and Heathrow said it was increasing resourcing as fast as possible to deal with rising passenger numbers. British Airways cancelled at least 64 domestic or European flights to or from Heathrow. Affected UK routes included Heathrow to Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Manchester and Newcastle, while the international routes affected were services to and from Berlin, Dublin, Geneva, Paris and Stockholm. British Airways said passengers were given advanced warning of the cancellations. EasyJet cancelled at least 25 flights to or from Gatwick, affecting routes between the West Sussex airport and Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Glasgow and Milan. The low-cost carrier said cancellations were being made “in advance to give customers the ability to rebook on to alternative flights”. Long queues have formed at some UK airports over the past week, with many families travelling abroad for the school Easter holidays – often for the first time since the travel restrictions were lifted. Travellers at Manchester airport have faced particularly long waits. On Monday, Heathrow – which is aiming to hire 12,000 staff to cope with an expected summer holiday boom – admitted that resources were “stretched”, as an increase in bookings created long delays over the Easter holiday period. “Following a very weak January and February, passenger numbers in March were the highest since the start of the pandemic, following the government’s removal of all travel restrictions, making the UK the first country in the world to do so,” the airport said. “The aviation sector has been rebuilding capacity ahead of a summer peak, so resources are stretched. Heathrow is working closely with airlines and ground handlers to make sure this increase in demand can be met while keeping passengers safe.” Heathrow said that demand was being driven by weekend and school holiday trips as the public “make the most of the freedom to travel and cash in vouchers from trips cancelled during Covid”. Heathrow was used by 4.2 million travellers in March, a 675% increase over the same month last year. In February 2020, the month before the onset of the pandemic resulted in the government implementing travel restrictions, it was used by 5.4 million. In the year to the end of March, total passenger numbers hit 27.3 million, an almost 200% increase over the previous 12 months. The airport has forecast 45 million passengers this year, just over half of pre-pandemic levels. However, the airport said holiday and business travel from foreign countries remained weak because of high Covid levels in the UK and the requirement to test before returning home. Last month, Heathrow said it was embarking on a recruitment drive to cope with a travel boom that would result in some days at the airport returning to almost pre-pandemic passenger levels. However, the airport said it would feel significantly busier because of additional pre-departure checks. “Half of global markets still require Covid checks including testing, vaccination status and quarantine, which is causing particular congestion in check-in areas at peak times,” the airport said on Monday. “Heathrow is advising passengers to check with their airline to confirm when they should get to the airport. Other airport processes are currently working to plan and Heathrow is working with Border Force to ensure sufficient levels of resource are in place to cope with the large number of passengers returning to the UK over the next couple of weeks.” Heathrow, which intends to reopen Terminal 4 before July, said last month that it was “particularly concerned over Border Force’s ability to scale up to meet demand” for the summer crowds. Failures in passport e-gates as well as additional Covid requirements have at times caused long queues in the immigration halls. “It is fantastic to see the airport coming back to life after two years, and I want to thank all team Heathrow colleagues for working together to serve our passengers,” said John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow. “Everyone at Heathrow is doing everything we can to make sure passengers get on their way as smoothly and safely as possible.” As the aviation industry recovers, passengers are facing fare increases after the Civil Aviation Authority approved a 37% rise in landing charges at Heathrow from January. The interim increase, from £22 to £30.19 a passenger, was less than the airport was seeking but nevertheless outraged airlines. Willie Walsh, a former chief executive of the parent company of British Airways who now leads the International Air Transport Association, accused Heathrow of “gouging” its customers. Last year, Holland-Kaye said between 15,000 and 25,000 jobs had been lost across the airport, including airline partners such as British Airways, in the first year of the pandemic.",News/Business,More flights cancelled as increased Easter passenger numbers pile on pressure,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/heathrow-airport-stretched-amid-busiest-period-since-pandemic-started
4/12/2022,"On a recent trip to Mexico I was reminded of the country’s astonishing variety of wild herbs and greens. Handfuls of different ones are used to flavour and colour broths, soups and corn doughs (which are used to make the likes of tamales). This herby green rice recipe has long been a favourite– it looks fabulous on a Lenten table spilling out of a whole chicken. Try different herbs in the puree – any mix of wild garlic, dill, tarragon and parsley would taste wonderful. I only use one ancho chilli if I am feeding this to the whole family, but try two if you like a little heat. Aleppo chilli flakes make a suitable substitution if you can’t find ancho. Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 20 minServes 6-8 For the chicken250g long-grain rice120g spinachA small bunch of corianderA large handful of wild garlic (or 2 fat garlic cloves, peeled)1 large onion, peeled and roughly chopped500ml chicken stock or water2 tbsp olive oil1 large chicken, at room temperature For the ancho butter1-2 ancho chillies, or 1-2 tsp aleppo chilli flakes2 fat garlic cloves70g butter, at room temperature1 handful fresh oregano (or thyme), leaves stripped and roughly chopped Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Soak the rice in cold water for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, wash the spinach, coriander and wild garlic (if using). Shake them dry. Blitz with the onion, and if using, garlic cloves, in a food processor, using 100ml of the stock to loosen it into a vivid green puree. Heat a large, deep saute pan over a medium heat and add the oil. Add the greens and stir-fry for a minute or two. Drain the rice and add to the pan, stirring well. Now add the rest of the stock, season generously and simmer for 15 minutes until the rice is a little under-cooked – not raw, but still retaining some bite. It will continue to cook a little in the oven. While the rice is cooking, de-stalk and de-seed the ancho chilli, tear into a few pieces and cover in boiling water. Leave to soften for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, smash the garlic and oregano together in a pestle or small food processor with a teaspoon of salt. Drain the ancho and add it to the garlic and oregano. Blitz to a paste before adding the butter. Mix well. Loosen the skin from the chicken all over the breast and thighs and smear the butter underneath. Put it in a roasting tray and stuff the cavity with the green rice, allowing what doesn’t fit inside to spill out into the tray. Pour the wine into the tray and roast for 50-60 minutes, until golden on the top and the juices run clear when the thighs are pierced with a skewer. (If you allow 15 minutes per 500g of bird plus 15 minutes you should be right). Serve with a plate of green vegetables or salad on the side. Instead of chicken, this recipe is delicious if you stuff a few hollowed-out squashes with the rice, and slather them in the ancho butter before roasting.

4/12/2022,"It’s impossible to watch this absorbing documentary about anti-Putin dissident Alexei Navalny without a terrible suspicion entering your mind: did Putin order his grotesque Ukraine invasion because of Navalny? Was it a diversionary tactic against the huge, growing wave of protest spearheaded by Navalny who, in 2021, had defiantly returned to Russia from German exile and whose instant arrest and imprisonment merely fanned the flames of his international celebrity? Putin was no doubt deeply enraged by this social-media megastar who had not only survived a Novichok assassination attempt but then humiliated the Kremlin by unmasking his malign and cack-handed would-be killers online. Navalny is an extraordinary figure in many ways: approachable, telegenic and easygoing. Or mostly easygoing, anyway: he can still sound irritable and defensive when questioned about his appearances on the same stage as extreme Russian nationalists about 10 years earlier, and perhaps this film could have looked harder at the facts of Navalny’s early life. But the real eye-opener is the interview with the Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grosev of the website Bellingcat who managed such breathtaking feats of detection on Navalny’s behalf in finding the FSB assailants. Grosev is all about data: by getting hold of passenger manifests, travel details or call records – and everything digital leaves a trace – he can put together an objective picture, even retrieving the culprits’ passport photos. It is quite staggering. And Navalny’s story has a particular resonance in Britain: he survived, but Dawn Sturgess did not – the blameless British national was fatally poisoned with Novichok on British soil in 2018, as the chaotic byproduct of a bungling attempt by Russian agents to kill former agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. For so many reasons, Navalny’s story concerns us all.  Navalny is released on 12 April in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Navalny review – staggering portrait of Putin’s extraordinary arch-enemy,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/11/navalny-review-staggering-portrait-of-putins-extraordinary-arch-enemy
4/12/2022,"When Kahiye Alim, director of the Council of Somali Organisations (CSO), saw reports that the suspected killer of Southend West MP David Amess was of Somali heritage, he was in a state of shock. Alim was out for dinner on a Friday evening when he heard the news, and could no longer eat. He began to worry about the repercussions the event would have on the British Somali community. Two weeks after the killing, his fears were realised. Abdirachid Fidow, from the Anti-Tribalism Movement, one of the few Somali organisations that reports hate crime, said they normally supported 60 victims a year. But the group had 40 cases, the majority of victims being women, reported to them in response to the naming of Ali Harbi Ali as the suspect. Fidow said at the time the organisation had been “overwhelmed” with the number of people calling them about their experiences in the two weeks afterwards. One of the charity’s grantees received death threats via emails, while another victim received racial abuse from her neighbour, referring to “MP killers”. These reports are likely to be a significant underestimate as the Somali community are unlikely to report hate crimes. It is for this reason that Alim worked to create educational videos explaining what a hate crime is and how to report it. While little is known about Ali himself, his family are well-established figures of political life in Mogadishu, Somalia. His uncle, Awale Kullane, is Somalia’s ambassador to China, while his grandfather ran as an MP in the 1960s. His father, Harbi Ali Kullane, a former communications adviser to the prime minister of Somalia, told reporters he was “traumatised” by his son’s actions. In his role as media adviser, Kullane worked on anti-terrorist campaigns against the jihadist group al-Shabaab. Friends and former colleagues described him as a liberal, charismatic, open-minded man who was not very religious. As the trial ends, so will the heightened attention on the community. Abdi Gure, the coordinator of the Hayaan project that supports the London Somali community with mental health issues, which is run by the charity Mind, warned it will then be business as usual, with long-known socioeconomic issues continuing to be ignored. Community organisers were struggling to get support for what Gure described as “an intergenerational gap”, which he said was feeding the grooming of boys into gang violence and a mental health crisis increasingly affecting the young. “We need to have a conversation with these young guys and establish a dialogue with them … [so they can] be an active part of the community, to give them recognition, and to give them the support and chance to lead,” Gure said. “This is not confined to the Somali community, but all communities need it.” As well as making a video on how to report hate crimes, the CSO created a second video highlighting the contributions of British Somalis in media, education, health and local politics. “People don’t understand who Somalis are, and it’s very important that they just don’t link the word Somali and extremism, because Somalis are not extremists,” Alim said. “We are British citizens and we’ve lived here for about 200 years.” That these basic facts about the community have to be repeated was a huge source of frustration. Fidow was particularly angry at the media, which he accused of fuelling racial tension. He was incredulous that journalists have been stopping British Somalis walking in the streets of west London to ask for their thoughts on the incident. “If you compare when Jo Cox was sadly killed by a white caucasian man, we did not see the media focusing and interviewing white British citizens. This is a form of discrimination and profiling,” he said. “Some media were purposely trying to focus the ethnicity of the suspect rather the crime and were creating a poisonous ‘us and them’ narrative.” As for the tragic killing of Amess, along with the rest of the country, the Somali community was stunned and devastated. “The community was shocked because they could not contemplate what has forced a 25-year-old who has never committed a crime to go to Southend to kill a member of parliament. To this day we still cannot figure out this case and the suspect’s motive,” Fidow said.",News/Society,‘The community was shocked’: British Somalis and the death of David Amess,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/11/the-community-was-shocked-british-somalis-and-the-death-of-david-amess

4/12/2022,"As France trudges towards a runoff election between a technocrat and a populist, it’s natural to want to help. “Don’t do it!”, say Americans on the socials, “Please, France, this is a really bad idea.” “It might seem fun now,” we, their neighbours, chime in, “but once you’re fielding a moral vacuum on the world stage, you’ll see that it isn’t fun at all.” It reminds me of the period just before the referendum, when Europeans begged us not to leave, with heart emojis and witty videos, and it changed my mind only insofar as it made the whole situation sadder, while not changing the minds of the leavers in any way. Or maybe that’s wrong: maybe it made them more determined. We often talk about political parochialism, and why it is, exactly, that we’re only interested in our own elections and have trouble focusing on other nations even when they’re very close by. Is it because we don’t, in the UK, tend to speak any other languages? Is it because foreign voting systems are baffling, or it’s often hard to figure out what a party stands for from its name? No, it’s because impotence is extremely painful. You think you have no democratic agency in your own nation, just because things never go the way you want – you don’t know what “no democratic agency” means until you’ve watched an election that you even halfway care about in a foreign land. You can have made every single mistake they’re making, with the battle scars to prove it, yet your advice counts for nothing, you’re just a wasp, buzzing warnings through double glazing.

Victoria Willing’s latest play bristles with the same deadpan darkness as her breakthrough show, Spring Offensive. It’s held together by a sharp sense of humour and truthfulness but could do with a bit more fire in the belly. Surrounded by dust and debris, in an economically effective set from Alys Whitehead, Gloria sits on a deckchair with her daylight lamp turned on full blast. She’s a woman on permanent holiday from reality. Debra Baker does well to bring light and shade to the central role but she’s a little muted.

The dialogue never feels as alive as Gloria’s monologues but there are fleeting moments of insight: the ugly liaisons with ghastly leftie neighbour Daniel, played with glowing smugness by Lucas Hare; the delicate sparks of affection with Gloria’s burned-out husband Graham (Kevin N Golding); the straight-talking relationship with eastern European best friend Magda, performed with biting precision by Izabella Urbanowicz.

4/12/2022,"Electric vehicles are on the rise – more electric cars were registered in the UK in 2021 than in the previous five years combined, and in December they accounted for one in every four cars sold, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. If you’re yet to be convinced, here’s what you need to know before you join the EV club … Can an electric car really be driven 380 miles on one charge?Potentially, yes. The new BMW all-electric iX 50 M Sport, for instance, has a WLTP-tested range (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure) of up to 380 miles*. This range could cover your weekly commute and leave enough charge for running around at the weekend. The range of an electric vehicle depends on a number of factors, including: driving style, route and weather conditions and how much luggage you’re carrying. So, as with regular cars, if you are driving shorter journeys and want the power it’s there. But if range is more your thing, you will have a large range – you just have to tailor your driving style. You are, in every sense, in the driving seat. Do I need a home charger?A study (pdf) found that 72% of UK drivers have access to off-street parking, meaning it could be easy for them to charge their cars at home. However, for those without driveways, charging can still be relatively simple. Venues as varied as supermarkets and gyms may have chargers, meaning you can top up your car as you shop or work out. Numbers of lamppost chargers are increasing all the time and some employers offer free charging at the workplace. What’s more, the latest generation of EVs charge faster, so you can charge on the go without having to stay stationary for too long. How do I find the chargers?There are now more than 30,000 public charging points across the UK, in more than 19,000 locations. Many new electric cars come with a built-in satnav that tells you where to find the nearest charging point, while the BMW Connected Drive system and the My BMW app can help you identify public charging locations and will literally guide you there. How much do electric cars cost?Although the price tags of some electric cars tend to be higher than their petrol-powered equivalents on paper, the government offers grants of up to £1,500 for the purchase of electric cars priced under £32,000. Electric cars are also exempt from vehicle tax. While prices for electricity are going up, so are petrol and diesel, and EV drivers with an annual mileage of 9,000 might enjoy significant savings, according to analysis by Which?. It found that charging an EV costs £500-£830 a year, if done mainly at home on a standard tariff, compared with the annual average fuel cost of £1,306-£1,916 for medium to large petrol or diesel cars. BMW has a fuel saving calculator that can estimate potential fuel savings. What is the driving experience like?From acceleration to noise, driving electric cars is smoother and more elegant. In fact, BMW has worked with composer Hans Zimmer on the driving noise of its all-electric i4 and iX models. You can deliver power instantly to the wheels in EVs, because they are free of the mechanical complexity of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Nowhere is this more thrilling than in the BMW i4 M50, which delivers powerful acceleration from a standstill. How much maintenance do they need?Electric vehicles need significantly less maintenance than their ICE equivalents for a very simple reason – they have fewer moving parts. There’s so much less that can go wrong. Also, the main parts of an EV, such as the battery and electronics, don’t need as much maintenance. What happens if I break down in an EV?Roadside assistance organisations such as the RAC have invested heavily in training and equipment for their patrols to support drivers of electric vehicles. Many of them carry mobile charging units, meaning they could get you back on the road quickly. All new BMWs purchased from a UK authorised BMW Centre come with roadside assistance cover for the first three years. How sustainable are EVs really?Sustainability is not just minimising emissions from driving, but the holistic philosophy behind the entire vehicle. For instance, the BMW iX is produced at facilities that use hydroelectric power. The cobalt and lithium used in EV batteries is procured by BMW, which ensures that environmental standards are maintained during extraction and processing. Materials used in the interiors include FSC certified wood in the centre console and olive-leaf tanned leather upholstery. Recycled aluminium and thermoplastics are also used intelligently where possible. What is the lifespan of an electric car battery?Although most manufacturers quote a five to eight-year warranty on their battery, with BMW offering the latter figure (or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first), the technology is improving at a rapid rate. All the more reason to say goodbye to your combustion engine and accelerate into the future. Book your BMW iX test drive+ here. To test drive+ the BMW i4 click here *These figures were obtained after the battery had been fully charged. The BMW i4 is a battery electric vehicle requiring mains electricity for charging.

4/12/2022,"The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, is to meet Vladimir Putin on Monday, the first European leader to meet the Russian president since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. In a tweet, Nehammer said Austria was “militarily neutral” but that it had a “clear stance on Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine”. Russia’s defence ministry claims it has destroyed a S-300 anti-aircraft missile system near Dnipro that had been supplied to Ukraine by an unspecified European country. The claim has been described as disinformation by Slovakia’s prime minister, Eduard Heger, whose country donated an S-300 system last week. In his nightly address to the nation on Sunday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of having “lost connection with reality to a degree that they accuse us of committing what Russian troops have obviously done”. Tens of thousands of people are likely to have been killed in Russia’s assault on the south-eastern city of Mariupol, and more than 300 Ukrainian hospitals have been destroyed, Zelenskiy told the South Korean parliament. Russia is likely to continue strikes on transport infrastructure “in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of hostilities”, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces has said in its latest operational report. In its latest intelligence update on Ukraine, the UK’s Ministry of Defence warns that Russia’s past use of phosphorus munitions in Donetsk “raised the possibility of their future employment in Mariupol as fighting for the city intensifies”. Pro-Russian forces in the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk have said they will intensify their fight in eastern Ukraine. Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia’s republic of Chechnya, has said there will be an offensive by Russian forces not only on ​Mariupol, but also on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, says Germany has seen massive indications of war crimes in Ukraine. Norway is to extend its deployment of 200 troops in Lithuania until August. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, has said the European Commission is working on details of an oil embargo on Russia as part of a possible new sanctions package. France’s ambassador to Ukraine, Etienne de Poncins, has posted a picture from Lviv showing teams of forensic officers that have arrived from France to assist local authorities in investigating war crimes.

4/12/2022,"When was the last time you saw a scientific paper? A physical one, I mean. An older academic in my previous university department used to keep all his scientific journals in recycled cornflakes boxes. On entering his office, you’d be greeted by a wall of Kellogg’s roosters, occupying shelf upon shelf, on packets containing various issues of Journal of Experimental Psychology, Psychophysiology, Journal of Neuropsychology, and the like. It was an odd sight, but there was method to it: if you didn’t keep your journals organised, how could you be expected to find the particular paper you were looking for? The time for cornflakes boxes has passed: now we have the internet. Having been printed on paper since the very first scientific journal was inaugurated in 1665, the overwhelming majority of research is now submitted, reviewed and read online. During the pandemic, it was often devoured on social media, an essential part of the unfolding story of Covid-19. Hard copies of journals are increasingly viewed as curiosities – or not viewed at all. But although the internet has transformed the way we read it, the overall system for how we publish science remains largely unchanged. We still have scientific papers; we still send them off to peer reviewers; we still have editors who give the ultimate thumbs up or down as to whether a paper is published in their journal. This system comes with big problems. Chief among them is the issue of publication bias: reviewers and editors are more likely to give a scientific paper a good write-up and publish it in their journal if it reports positive or exciting results. So scientists go to great lengths to hype up their studies, lean on their analyses so they produce “better” results, and sometimes even commit fraud in order to impress those all-important gatekeepers. This drastically distorts our view of what really went on. There are some possible fixes that change the way journals work. Maybe the decision to publish could be made based only on the methodology of a study, rather than on its results (this is already happening to a modest extent in a few journals). Maybe scientists could just publish all their research by default, and journals would curate, rather than decide, which results get out into the world. But maybe we could go a step further, and get rid of scientific papers altogether. Scientists are obsessed with papers – specifically, with having more papers published under their name, extending the crucial “publications” section of their CV. So it might sound outrageous to suggest we could do without them. But that obsession is the problem. Paradoxically, the sacred status of a published, peer-reviewed paper makes it harder to get the contents of those papers right. Consider the messy reality of scientific research. Studies almost always throw up weird, unexpected numbers that complicate any simple interpretation. But a traditional paper – word count and all – pretty well forces you to dumb things down. If what you’re working towards is a big, milestone goal of a published paper, the temptation is ever-present to file away a few of the jagged edges of your results, to help “tell a better story”. Many scientists admit, in surveys, to doing just that – making their results into unambiguous, attractive-looking papers, but distorting the science along the way. And consider corrections. We know that scientific papers regularly contain errors. One algorithm that ran through thousands of psychology papers found that, at worst, more than 50% had one specific statistical error, and more than 15% had an error serious enough to overturn the results. With papers, correcting this kind of mistake is a slog: you have to write in to the journal, get the attention of the busy editor, and get them to issue a new, short paper that formally details the correction. Many scientists who request corrections find themselves stonewalled or otherwise ignored by journals. Imagine the number of errors that litter the scientific literature that haven’t been corrected because to do so is just too much hassle. Finally, consider data. Back in the day, sharing the raw data that formed the basis of a paper with that paper’s readers was more or less impossible. Now it can be done in a few clicks, by uploading the data to an open repository. And yet, we act as if we live in the world of yesteryear: papers still hardly ever have the data attached, preventing reviewers and readers from seeing the full picture. The solution to all these problems is the same as the answer to “How do I organise my journals if I don’t use cornflakes boxes?” Use the internet. We can change papers into mini-websites (sometimes called “notebooks”) that openly report the results of a given study. Not only does this give everyone a view of the full process from data to analysis to write-up – the dataset would be appended to the website along with all the statistical code used to analyse it, and anyone could reproduce the full analysis and check they get the same numbers – but any corrections could be made swiftly and efficiently, with the date and time of all updates publicly logged. This would be a major improvement on the status quo, where the analysis and writing of papers goes on entirely in private, with scientists then choosing on a whim whether to make their results public. Sure, throwing sunlight on the whole process might reveal ambiguities or hard-to-explain contradictions in the results – but that’s how science really is. There are also other potential benefits of this hi-tech way of publishing science: for example, if you were running a long-term study on the climate or on child development, it would be a breeze to add in new data as it appears. There are barriers to big changes like this. Some are to do with skills: it’s easy to write a Word document with your results and send it in to a journal, as we do now; it’s harder to make a notebook website that weaves together the data, code and interpretation. More importantly, how would peer review operate in this scenario? It’s been suggested that scientists could hire “red teams” – people whose job is to pick holes in your findings – to dig into their notebook sites and test them to destruction. But who would pay, and exactly how the system would work, is up for debate. We’ve made astonishing progress in so many areas of science, and yet we’re still stuck with the old, flawed model of publishing research. Indeed, even the name “paper” harkens back to a bygone age. Some fields of science are already moving in the direction I’ve described here, using online notebooks instead of journals – living documents instead of living fossils. It’s time for the rest of science to follow suit.

4/12/2022,"This soulful, heavy hearted drama tells a tale of gentrification and community displacement in Cambodia. It’s a fictional story about the real-life White Building, an iconic modernist apartment block built in 1963 in the centre of Phnom Penh and demolished in 2017. The film’s director, Kavich Neang, has a personal connection: he grew up in the White Building and opens his film with an extraordinary drone shot that floats above the building’s roof. From this angle the mosaic of chipped tiles and rusted corrugated sheets looks strangely beautiful: a metaphor perhaps for the White Building itself, which is crumbling and not fit for habitation, but still home to a vibrant diverse community, everyone happily jostling in the corridors. Neang’s story is about a boy’s coming of age as his family is evicted. Piseth Chhun gives a sensitive performance as Nang, who at the start of the movie, bleached streaks in his hair, dreams of boyband-style fame with his hip-hop dance squad, which is basically him and two mates. He lives with his mum and sculptor dad in the building, whose residents are being pushed out so property developers can move in. The miserably low payoff will force most of them out of the city, where house prices are skyrocketing. The film follows Nang as he matures from boy to man. His dad is spokesman for the tenants’ association, and there are bad-tempered meetings about whether to accept the eviction deal. Then the building’s water supply is switched off. Worryingly, Nang’s dad has an infected big toe, which appears to be gangrenous, a complication of diabetes; the blackening spreads like the mould on the apartment’s ceiling. This is a gentle-going watch, understated – underpowered even – and sometimes a little drowsy. Still, it has real sensitivity and insight into the transition to adulthood, as gradually it dawns on Nang that his parents don’t have all the answers. White Building is available on Mubi from Wednesday.",Arts/Film,White Building review – soulful drama captures coming of age and eviction in Cambodia,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/11/white-building-review-soulful-drama-captures-coming-of-age-and-eviction-in-cambodia

4/12/2022,"As I start this latest cutesy adventure with the adorable pink blob Kirby, I’ve just returned from a journey of my own – and with an unwelcome stowaway, in the form of whatever variant of Covid I picked up on the trip. As Kirby is whisked away to an overgrown world that looks eerily like a post-apocalyptic Earth, the skies outside my flat turn an ominous grey. Happily, Kirby’s colourful capers prove to be just the tonic I need. From an opening sequence in which our perky pink blob transforms into a car and cruises along to a Japanese pop song (complete with karaoke-ready lyrics) to the bouncing ball’s signature level-completion moonwalk, Kirby and the Forgotten Land is a delight from start to finish. What I really enjoyed about this kid-friendly adventure is that Nintendo gets endearingly weird. Throughout the 10-hour romp, there are several moments where I have to double check I’m not having a Covid-induced fever dream. One moment I’ve become a walking vending machine, leading a gaggle of happily waddling ducklings back to their concerned mother, the next I’m thrown into a post-apocalyptic shopping mall, cleaving snarling creatures in two with a gigantic sword. It’s this utterly bizarre dichotomy that keeps me interested, despite the absence of challenge. Where Nintendo’s perky pink mascot jumped and swallowed his way through expectedly bright, abstract levels in previous versions, this cutesy take on a post-apocalyptic wasteland abandons all that for overgrown theme parks and eerily abandoned research facilities. They’re landscapes that feel less like Mario, and more as if they have been torn from the code of 2017’s trippy Nier: Automata. By the time you reach the end, things escalate sharply for our poor pink pal. The Forgotten Land’s finale feels closer to something you’d expect from Final Fantasy. From scaling overgrown tower blocks to navigating ghost-ridden haunted house rides in a creature-infested theme park, it feels endlessly inventive. After decades of fun but fairly forgettable adventures, Kirby is emerging from Mario’s shadow. The Forgotten Land has surprisingly cinematic flair, and many of the levels are broken up by impressively slick cutscenes. A rip-roaring orchestral soundtrack also helps elevate this adorable hero’s outing from his usual mid-budget fare; it stands shoulder to shoulder with Mario Kart 8’s brassy bangers. You can play the entire game in co-op, too – given that I was ridden with the ’rona, though, I bounced, jumped and swallowed alone. Still, it says a lot about The Forgotten Land’s charms that even Covid didn’t kirb my enthusiasm. If you’re looking for a sliver of joy in bleak times, Nintendo always delivers.

4/12/2022,"The murder of Sabina Nessa would have provoked a more intense public outcry if the primary school teacher had been white, her relatives have said, as they accused the home secretary of exploiting her death for publicity. Nessa’s sister, Jebina Yasmin Islam, said there had been no support from the government, describing people in senior positions as useless, and saying the murder of Sarah Everard six months before that of Nessa had received more press coverage. “My sister didn’t get as much headlines, I feel, at the start. Maybe was it down to her ethnicity?” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “She didn’t get the front pages on some of the papers and, in Sarah Everard’s case, she did. I think it’s just down to our ethnicity, to be honest. And I feel like if we were a normal British white family we would have been treated equally, I guess.” She said the family had received the support of Clive Efford, the Labour MP in whose constituency the murder took place, as well as the local authority, the Royal Borough of Greenwich. But she said “higher-up people” had been “useless”, adding: “They’ve not said nothing. Priti Patel has done a tweet on Friday and I was not happy about it because all of a sudden she’s using my sister’s name for publicity reasons. And to be honest she has no right.” On Friday, Koci Selamaj was jailed for life with a minimum of 36 years for the murder. He admitted travelling to London from the south coast to carry out the premeditated attack on a random woman on 17 September last year. He targeted Nessa after happening upon her as she walked through Cator Park in Kidbrooke, south-east London, to meet a friend. CCTV footage captured the moment he ran up behind her and hit her over the head, before dragging her away and killing her by asphyxiation. Selamaj refused to attend any of his two-day sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey and Islam said: “I was frustrated. We were like: ‘He is such a coward, not facing up to what he has done.’ “It made me angry because I wanted him to hear our impact statement to show how much hurt he’s caused my family.” Asked if the court should have the power to force someone to attend, she said: “Definitely.

4/12/2022,"Good morning. Austria’s chancellor is to meet Vladimir Putin on Monday, the Russian president’s first face-to-face meeting with an EU leader since ordering the invasion of Ukraine, amid warnings of a fresh offensive and shelling in the east. Karl Nehammer said the meeting would take place in Moscow and that Austria had a “clear position on the Russian war of aggression”, calling for humanitarian corridors, a ceasefire and full investigation of war crimes. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser in Washington, has warned that the appointment of a new general in command of Russia’s military campaign is likely to usher in a fresh round of “crimes and brutality” against civilians. Alexandr Dvornikov, 60, came to prominence at the head of Russian troops in Syria in 2015-16, when there was particularly brutal bombardment of rebel-held areas, including civilian populations, in Aleppo. What might Russia do next? The UK Ministry of Defence warned on Monday morning that Russian forces may resort to using phosphorous weapons in Mariupol as fighting for the city intensifies. It cited the previous use of the munitions by Russian soldiers in Donetsk. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 47 of the invasion. A key Republican on the House January 6 committee disputed a report that said the panel was split over whether to refer Donald Trump to the Department of Justice for criminal charges regarding his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, leading to the Capitol attack. “There’s not really a dispute on the committee,” the Wyoming representative Liz Cheney told CNN’s State of the Union. The New York Times said otherwise on Sunday, in a report headlined: “January 6 panel has evidence for criminal referral of Trump, but splits on sending.” “The debate centers on whether making a referral – a largely symbolic act – would backfire by politically tainting the justice department’s expanding investigation into the January 6 assault and what led up to it,” the paper said. Citing “members and aides”, the Times said such sources were reluctant to support a referral because it would create the impression Democrats had asked the attorney general, Merrick Garland, to investigate Trump. What did Cheney say? “We have not made a decision about referrals on the committee … [but] it’s actually clear that what President Trump was dealing with, what a number of people around him were doing, that they knew it was awful. That they did it anyway.” France faces a brutal two-week campaign over the country’s future, as the centrist incumbent, Emmanuel Macron, faces the far-right Marine Le Pen for the presidency, positioning himself as a pro-European “progressive” against what he calls her anti-Muslim, nationalist programme and “complacency” about Putin. Macron topped Sunday’s first round of the French presidential election with 27.6% of the vote, ahead of Le Pen’s 23.4%, according to initial projected results by Ipsos for France Télévisions. He scored higher than his result in the first round five years ago, and clearly gained support in the final hours of the campaign after his harsh warnings to voters to hold back the far right and protect France’s place on the international diplomatic stage during the war in Ukraine. But Le Pen’s score was also higher than five years ago. Why is Le Pen doing better this time? She had steadily gained support after campaigning hard on the cost of living crisis and inflation, which had become voters’ biggest concerns. What has Macron said? He told reporters: “When the far-right, in all its forms, represents that much in France, you can’t consider things are going well, so you must go out and convince people with a lot of humility, and respect for those who weren’t on our side in this first round.” A federal judge has indicated that an attempt to stop the far-right Republican congressperson Marjorie Taylor Greene running for re-election will be allowed to proceed. The challenge from a group of Georgia voters says Greene should be disqualified because she supported insurrectionists on 6 January 2021. After dozens of botched, evidently painful lethal injections in recent years, prisoners in at least 10 states have been making a surreal argument: they would prefer the firing squad. As more “technological” methods have proved grisly, some states are considering shooting prisoners instead. Elon Musk has performed a U-turn on joining Twitter’s board despite becoming the social media company’s largest shareholder with a 9.2% stake. He was due to become a board member on Saturday but Twitter’s chief executive, Parag Agrawal, said on Monday morning that Musk had declined the offer. The British chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has written to the prime minister to ask for an investigation into his own affairs after days of criticism over his wife’s “non-dom” tax status. Sunak has also been criticised over his decision to keep a US green card conferring permanent residency months while chancellor. In an unusual and labor intensive project, two political scientists paid a group of regular Fox News viewers to instead watch CNN for a month. At the end of the period, the researchers found surprising results; some of the Fox News watchers had changed their minds on a range of key issues, including the US response to coronavirus and Democrats’ attitude to police. The findings suggest political perspectives can be changed – but also reveals the influence partisan media has on viewers’ ideology, writes, Adam Gabbatt. As one half of the White Stripes, the Detroit musician conquered the world. His supercharged garage rock duo was a global phenomenon, and he has barely paused since. He fronted the Raconteurs and played drums in the Dead Weather, worked with the country singer Loretta Lynn and has been a producer and video-maker, while his eclectic Third Man operation takes in everything from a record label and record shops to a publishing imprint. After a busy lockdown, he is back with two new solo albums. The world of money is at least as unbalanced and unfair as the world of political power – but in ways that may make it a little easier for climate advocates to make progress. Putin’s grotesque war might be where some of these strands come together. It highlights the ways that fossil fuel builds autocracy, and the power that control of scarce supplies gives to autocrats. But we’ve got years, not decades, to get the climate crisis under some kind of control. We won’t get more moments like this.

4/12/2022,"High in la Alpujarra, on the slopes of the majestic Sierra Nevada in Andalucía, the silence is broken only by the sound of a stream trickling through the snow. Except it is not a stream but an acequia, part of a network of thousands of kilometres of irrigation channels created by Muslim peasant farmers more than a thousand years ago. The channel begins at an altitude of 1,800 metres (5,900ft) and, fed by the melting snow, for centuries supplied water to the village of Cáñar and beyond until it fell into disuse in the 1980s through the gradual depopulation of the area. Now, it is flowing again thanks to a project devised by the laboratory of biocultural archaeology at the University of Granada and backed by local and European funding. With the help of volunteers, the MemoLab project is restoring the region’s extraordinary hydrological network at a time when the climate crisis is exposing Spain to prolonged periods of drought and intensive farming is putting extreme pressure on water supplies. When Arabs and Berbers colonised Spain early in the eighth century, they brought techniques in water conservation acquired over centuries in the Middle East. “The Islamic agricultural revolution was the first green revolution. They brought together techniques and knowledge about water, soil, plants and also how snow behaves,” says José María Martín Civantos, an archaeology professor at the university and the driving force behind the project. “They transformed the way water is used in the Mediterranean.” The techniques introduced by the Muslims allowed for more agricultural diversity, with crops such as sugar cane and citrus fruits introduced. “Involving people in the creation of these irrigation systems was a way of assimilating the existing population, who could see the advantages,” adds Civantos. Rain comes to the Mediterranean in brief, torrential bursts, with the result that most of the water is lost as it runs off into rivers and the sea. The genius of the acequia system is that by controlling the flow of the water, whether from rain or snowmelt, it reduces runoff, while at the same time allowing water to be absorbed into the land to replenish the aquifers in what is literally a trickle-down effect. Civantos describes this as “sowing water”. Rather than diverting water towards specific crops, the idea is to “soak the mountain” so that water can be stored in aquifers to be used in times of drought. “The basic requirement for the system to work is that the channel isn’t too permeable and has a gradient that maintains the correct flow of water. Then you need a community of people to maintain it,” says Sergio Martos-Rosillo, a geologist involved in the project. “The system is efficient, the aquifers get replenished and no technology is required,” he says, adding that the revival of similar techniques is being explored in several Latin American countries, including Peru, and there is also interest from California where modern irrigation techniques have become unsustainable. The system in Spain “has been in use for over 1,000 years, proving its adaptability”, Martos-Rosillo says. “It’s much more manageable and adaptable than building a dam and much more resistant to climate change.” Cayetano Álvarez, president of the community of irrigators in Cáñar, is in no doubt about the impact the project has had on the village. “Everyone is obliged to maintain the channels on their land,” he says. “This project has made a big difference, but there are abandoned acequias in many other villages nearby.” The system is integrated and if land is abandoned and channels left to clog up, the water cannot flow past the blockage. So every spring, the university and villages organise groups of volunteers to clear obstructions from the acequias. “It is not just a matter of clearing away leaves and mud. We also consult with local people about how to lay the pieces of slate that line the acequias,” says José Antonio Palma García, who has been volunteering for five years. “I feel good doing this work. I feel like I am giving something back to the earth. I also meet people I’d never normally meet – we’re like a big family.” On the other side of the sierra lies the village of Alfacar, high above Granada, close to where it is widely believed fascists murdered the poet Federico García Lorca at the start of the civil war in 1936. It is also the site of a brick-walled pool of clear mountain water known as the teardrop spring. “It’s called that because of its shape,” says Elena Correa Jiménez, a researcher on the project. “The spring is supplied from an aquifer and the acequia was created 1,100 years ago to supply water to Albaicín, the medina of Granada, 8km [five miles] away.” MemoLab has restored much of the acequia and, although it doesn’t reach Albaicín, it now irrigates the university’s gardens. Civantos says one of the challenges of the project was trying to recover collective knowledge that was never written down. Due to the Catholic reconquest of Islamic Spain and the expulsion of the Muslim population early in the 17th century, much of this knowledge was lost. “People don’t think peasant farmers could devise anything this complex,” Civantos says. “The Romans built aqueducts and other waterworks but it was always for the glory of the state. This work was done so ordinary people could survive. “Recovering this system involves recognising an important part of our heritage. Muslim Spain was primarily an agrarian society. “You can’t understand the glory of Córdoba or Granada without understanding that what lay behind it was the wealth created by a form of agriculture that was much more advanced and productive than elsewhere in Europe.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Spring time: why an ancient water system is being brought back to life in Spain,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/11/ancient-water-system-restore-spain-sierra-nevada-aoe
