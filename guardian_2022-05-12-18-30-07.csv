5/12/2022,"More than 100 fixed-penalty notices have now been handed out for breaches of lockdown rules in Downing Street and other government buildings, the Metropolitan police has announced. The force previously said it had issued more than 50 such fines, but it had not updated the public on the progress of its investigation in recent weeks while the local election campaign was taking place. In a statement on Thursday it said the total had reached twice that. Its investigation is still ongoing. Downing Street confirmed on Wednesday that the prime minister had still received only one fine, for a birthday party in June 2020. His wife, Carrie Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were fined for the same event, which the junior minister Conor Burns described as the prime minister being “ambushed with a cake”. Boris Johnson has told friends he believes he will not receive further fines, and said publicly last week that he had not yet received a questionnaire from the Met about the leaving do of his aide Lee Cain, at which he is believed to have poured drinks. Some fines have already been issued for the “bring your own booze” garden drinks organised by Johnson’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, on 20 May 2020. Johnson admitted attending that gathering for a few minutes but insisted he believed it was a work event. Many Conservative MPs are awaiting the publication of the senior civil servant Sue Gray’s full report on lockdown breaches in Downing Street before deciding whether to move against the prime minister. Johnson also faces an investigation by the House of Commons privileges committee into whether he misled parliament by reassuring MPs when the Partygate stories first emerged that “all guidance was followed completely” in Downing Street.",News/Politics,Partygate: Met says over 100 fines now issued for lockdown breaches,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/12/partygate-met-says-over-100-fines-issued-lockdown-breaches-downing-street
5/12/2022,"Iwas very fit and healthy when I was deployed for the Gulf war. I ran to work every morning and led the military fitness training. I was also into motocross and used to play rugby. Now, after 30 years of suffering from “Gulf war syndrome”, I still struggle to breathe and just a month ago I had to have an injection in my spine to block the pain from my damaged nerves. For decades since the Gulf war, thousands of veterans have suffered from mystery illnesses. Part of that suffering has been not knowing the cause of that illness and not knowing what was really happening to my body. Now US scientists, partly funded by the American government, say what caused thousands of soldiers like me to fall sick was the nerve agent sarin, released into the air when Iraqi chemical weapons stocks were bombed. I worked primarily as a tank transporter in the Gulf, driving ahead on a motorbike to find safe routes through the desert. Soldiers in the tanks were probably safe inside, but I only had a cloth over my mouth to prevent me swallowing bugs or sand, and so was heavily exposed to chemicals in the air. On returning from the war I received treatment for PTSD. But the doctors noticed that something was wrong: my body as well as my mind was affected. My joints became incredibly sore, I struggled to breathe and started to suffer from chronic fatigue. This, of course, exacerbated my PTSD. I am not alone in suffering these symptoms. I’m one of a relatively small number receiving a war pension for my service in the Gulf, but I know there are likely far more struggling. (Research by the Royal British Legion suggests that although 1,300 people in the UK receive a war pension for service in the Gulf, 33,000 veterans have Gulf war syndrome.) My doctors guessed this right. They wrote off the idea that I had been exposed to depleted uranium deposits, and suspected exposure to chemical weaponry instead. In the US, the government has long recognised the existence of Gulf war syndrome. However, despite all the evidence, Britain’s Ministry of Defence denied that Gulf war syndrome even existed until 2005. In 2010, it was refusing the majority of claims for war pensions from veterans suffering from the condition. Most veterans with symptoms do not receive a war pension for service in the Gulf to this day. This matters to me because the time I served in the Gulf and what happened to me there had a huge effect on my life and does to this day. I still suffer from PTSD, and the physical pain makes it worse. My family life has fallen apart. The support that I have had in recent years has been from charities and doctors, who have gone out of their way to help me. But I feel ignored by the government. Even now I face a lack of clarity over my pension. We can’t turn back the clock, but now that we have strong reason to believe these debilitating illnesses are caused by exposure to sarin gas, I want the MoD to say sorry for ignoring what doctors and veterans were telling them. The suicide rate among Gulf war veterans is high and the parents of veterans who took their own lives as well as the thousands of us who continue to suffer from exposure to sarin deserve confirmation of what we are now being told. But most of all we deserve an apology.

5/12/2022,"We are reaching the climax of Othello and a young man in the audience is getting fractious. Every time Othello is characterised as “the Moor”, he shouts out. He is further infuriated by Iago’s degrading animal imagery. An usher shushes him. “You’re spoiling it for everyone,” he says. The boy is quick to respond: “They’re spoiling it for me.” Unwilling to be thrown out, the boy takes to the stage. Like an egalitarian Thomas Bowdler, he is on a mission to rewrite Shakespeare. Out must come the othering language, the insulting talk of the “beast with two backs”, and the implication that a union between Gabriel Akamo’s black Othello and Rayyah McCaul’s white Desdemona presents a problem. The boy wants an end of labels and an acceptance of possibility. Stepping out of character as Desdemona, McCaul morphs into Cathy, a needy actor, grateful for getting her first gig in two years. She thinks she might be to blame for the disruption. Preparing a backstory in rehearsals, the actor imagined Desdemona had been pregnant with twins. She hadn’t thought through the implications of bringing mixed-heritage children into the world, but here is Harris Cain’s Nothello stepping out of the audience to put her right. Joining him is Aimee Powell as his sister, Desdeknownow. She has spent the past four centuries auditioning for a part (“not too black, not too white”) that never comes her way. Now is their time. In Mojisola Adebayo’s clever and joyful play – partly inspired by conversations with residents of Coventry, the home of 2 Tone – the twins wear down Alex Scott Fairley’s Iago and their would-be parents in order to stop the age-old repetition of racist tropes. They need a happy ending in order to be born. It runs for only 75 minutes, but somehow Justine Themen’s production also finds time to comment on the death of George Floyd, gender fluidity and Covid (“Try being locked down for 400 years,” says Powell). Even more inclusive is the all-ages community cast, seamlessly melding with the professional actors in a show that is as bright and brainy as it is urgent.

5/12/2022,"The new chairman of GB News has a history of sharing articles that dismiss the threat of climate breakdown, it can be revealed, sharpening concerns about the TV channel’s role as a platform for advocates of the continued burning of fossil fuels. Alan McCormick, a co-founder of Legatum Group, a Dubai-based investment firm and one of the channel’s key funders, tweeted several articles by climate science deniers, an investigation by DeSmog found, including one claiming there was “no scientific proof” that humans were causing the climate emergency. GB News frequently hosts guests who cast doubt on climate science and oppose green polices, including the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) of Conservative MPs. In March, Nigel Farage, one of the channel’s main presenters, launched a call for a “net zero referendum” on the UK’s climate targets modelled on his Brexit campaign. McCormick, whose appointment was made public at the end of April, has also tweeted praise for calls for economic deregulation in the UK by the Tory MP Steve Baker. Baker is also leading the NZSG’s backbench revolt against the UK’s 2050 net zero goal and is a trustee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), which opposes action on the climate crisis. McCormick’s tweets about climate change, reviewed by DeSmog, appeared between 2013 and 2017 and mostly consisted of an article headline and a link without comment. In March 2015, he tweeted a Wall Street Journal article headlined “The Political Assault on Climate Skeptics”. The writer was Richard S Lindzen, a US scientist who has received thousands of dollars from fossil fuel-funded thinktanks and said believing carbon dioxide is the main cause of climate change is “pretty close to believing in magic”. The same month, McCormick tweeted “Why I am a climate sceptic”, an article by Patrick Moore published by the Heartland Institute, a US fossil fuel-backed thinktank. In it, Moore suggests claims that humans are behind the climate emergency are scientifically unsound and calls on readers to “celebrate carbon dioxide”. In May 2017, McCormick tweeted a WSJ editorial in which the columnist Holman W Jenkins Jr writes that “climate advocacy has morphed into a religion”. The climate sceptic tweets appear to stop in 2017 but McCormick recently retweeted an article by the GWPF adviser Matt Ridley recycling unproven claims that anti-fracking protests have been funded by Russia. McCormick’s appointment as chairman of GB News’s parent company, All Perspectives Ltd, was first reported by Guido Fawkes, the political blog. Companies House records show he has been a director since April 2021. He and two other men involved in Legatum – Mark Stoleson, its Maltese chief executive, and Christopher Chandler, a New Zealand-born billionaire – are listed as “persons with significant control”, meaning they hold at least a quarter of shares or voting rights. GB News has not only emerged as an arena for Conservative MPs opposed to net zero to make their case, but also employs presenters who have used the channel to promote climate sceptic views. Last summer, Dan Wootton, the former Sun showbiz editor, used his platform on GB News to accuse the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of using “hysterical” language and “spreading terror”. Last month, Darren Grimes accused the UK government of “net zero zealotry” in a self-described “ode to oil”. Farage, brought in as GB News’s main presenter after the departure of the founding chairman and broadcasting heavyweight Andrew Neil, has likened his net zero campaign to his push for Brexit. Jennie King, from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue thinktank, said GB News had become a “central hub” for climate scepticism in the British media, and that “its influence increasingly extends beyond UK borders”. “Using GB News as a platform, Farage and others have almost single-handedly manufactured controversy around a net zero referendum, despite minimal evidence of public support,” King said. “Such content not only influences policymaking in the UK, but is excerpted and used by anti-climate movements across the globe.” Legatum and GB News did not respond to requests for comment.",News/Media,GB News chairman has history of dismissing threat of climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/12/gb-news-chairman-alan-mccormick-has-history-of-dismissing-threat-of-climate-crisis
5/12/2022,"Clare Balding, 51, joined the BBC as a trainee in 1994, and has since led the coverage of sporting events including the Olympics and Paralympics, Royal Ascot and the Commonwealth Games. She is also the president of the Rugby Football League. In 2021, you present the BBC’s coverage of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics … from Salford. How was that?The tech team did a terrific job; with Bethany Firth, the swimmer who won gold for Team GB at the Paralympics, we had her mum on the line just as her hand touched the wall, which was brilliant. The other benefit of being here is that you know what’s catching on and what people are responding to, which you don’t always know when you’re in another time zone. Of course, the big difference since the last Olympic cycle is that athletes have more confidence in their own voice, whether that’s Simone Biles or Emily Campbell, the weightlifter who wanted to use her platform to talk about body image. They have become much more vocal, and they represent more than just sport. What would you be doing if you weren’t a presenter?I nearly went into advertising, which I don’t think is dissimilar to my job now. What I’m doing is finding a hook, and a way of making people care about sports and sportspeople. What show had you gripped during the last year?The Morning Show. I bloody loved it.

5/12/2022,"Sarah, 45, describes herself as a “total Cupid” – “always single, and always connecting my single friends”. When we speak, she has just set up an old friend with a new one she met through yoga. “They hit it off straight away,” she says. She is waiting for a positive outcome from another pair too: “I haven’t given up on them yet.” A generation ago, the Sarahs of this world were in heavy demand: your extended network was the first place you’d look for love. For a while, it seemed that technology had made them redundant: a 2019 Stanford University study showed the proportion of couples who had met through friends had plummeted, displaced by online dating. But, as the Tinder era enters its second decade, many single people are once again yearning for a more personal romantic approach. This could be why nearly 70% of respondents to a 2020 Pew Research Center survey said their dating lives were not going well. “It’s become easy to meet, but harder to connect,” says Lakshmi Rengarajan, a New York-based workplace consultant at WeWork and elsewhere, who has been pairing people up for over a decade. Her goal has always been to “make dating more human”, she says. But the pandemic presented her with her biggest challenge yet. “All of a sudden, everybody had no choice but to use the apps.” In response, Rengarajan started the podcast Paired by the People, which is dedicated to reviving the art of the setup. In each episode, Rengarajan interviews a couple whose meeting was engineered by friends, or sets up strangers herself, with a view to showing listeners how they might go about it. As confident as they might be about making connections elsewhere in life, says Rengarajan, many people feel unsure about how to facilitate or request a date, worrying it could be intrusive to offer or desperate to ask. “I think they have a very antiquated notion of what a setup looks like,” she says. So, if you are single and want to be set up, how should you go about it? First, Rengarajan says, be clear about it with your friends – but only tell them the absolute deal-breakers for your potential partner such as sexuality or politics. “At the most basic level, it’s saying: ‘I am open to being introduced.’” Providing them with a laundry list of desired characteristics piles on too much pressure – and goes against the setup’s spirit of serendipity. “The language is important: don’t use words like ‘perfect’ or ‘match’ – even ‘good for me’ has a lot of judgment,” Rengarajan says. The perfect phrasing, she suggests, is “someone you think I would get along with”. “Give them permission to go with their gut, and tell them that if it doesn’t work out, it’s not a big deal.” By putting them at ease, says Rengarajan, you lower the stakes for yourself, too. Dating apps can make us so particular and quick to judge, she says, but if a friend has put in the effort of choosing someone for you, you are less likely to dismiss them out of hand. “People have a very low tolerance for awkward conversations. With a setup, I think your tolerance is slightly higher: ‘I’m not going to discard this person immediately – I’m going to at least let them finish their latte.’” If you are finding someone a date, be thoughtful, but don’t overthink it. “Don’t ask yourself if they could get married, or even if they could spend eight hours together,” says Rengarajan. “Just imagine: would they get along?” Rather than explicitly setting up her housemate and colleague, Imogen “deliberately and repeatedly” engineered for them to meet at social events. “I was sure they would fall in love: they’re both into philosophy and the same Korean restaurant in east London.” When they eventually went on a date, “I was so excited that my scheming and string-pulling had worked,” says Imogen, 32. But her housemate called it off abruptly, hurting her colleague’s feelings – “and now she doesn’t want to come round to my house any more”, says Imogen. “I sort of wish I’d left it well enough alone.” But Imogen doesn’t think that a more considered setup would have had a happier ending – it might have made her feel even more guilty, she says. “I think that’s something you have to be ready for if you do an explicit set-up. Rengarajan’s response to such disasters is sanguine. “What I always say to people is, your friends have sent you to bad restaurants, bad parties or bad vacation spots, and you didn’t punish them for that. I think good friendships can survive this.” The introduction itself is crucial, Rengarajan says. Many people give recommendations, such as: “She’s a great friend,” which are too general to be telling. Sharing an entire relationship history, on the other hand, might extinguish a potential romance prematurely. Instead, Rengarajan swears by offering a telling anecdote. “I can tell you ‘Bob is a great guy,’ or I can tell you ‘Bob is such a good friend, he helped me move into my fourth-floor walk-up apartment in New York in the summer.’” Such stories prime the pair to see each other as rounded individuals, rather than just another date, she says. “It’s unbelievable how it changes the trajectory – they even start to look different to you.” Bonnie, 36, encouraged her housemate to go on a date with her friend, and they are now married with two children. “I joke that the reason I suggested they invite each other for a drink was that they both have great taste in balsamic vinegar, and that Polly would be able to hold her own when Tom inevitably launched into a long conversation about international relations,” she says. “In truth, they were simply both a couple of the smartest, most well-put-together and funniest people I knew – I just had a feeling.” And that feeling was reciprocated: “A nudge was all they needed – that first drink turned into a three-day date,” says Bonnie. After making the introduction, you could check in to see whether your friends have made plans to meet (and give a gentle push if not: inbox overwhelm is real, says Rengarajan), or suggest a venue or activity. But the rest is down to them, for better or worse. “I don’t think you should feel entitled to an update,” she says. It is natural to feel some trepidation about bringing friends together, Rengarajan says, but the worst-case scenario could be no more than slight awkwardness. “You will survive running into an ex, or having to rearrange your dinner party.” In fact, involving more people in your search for love can make it feel fun. On one episode of Paired by the People, Rengarajan interviewed a woman who roped her friends into finding her 12 dates for her “date of the month club”. “I’m not looking for Mr Perfect, I’m looking for Mr November,” Jenny Tolan told them in her explanatory email. Her friends responded with enthusiasm – and Tolan ended up marrying Mr July. For anyone burnt out by dating, Rengarajan says, this approach can be refreshing. “People think it’s this big production, and it’s not. You can have fun with it. “We do know how to do this,” she adds. Our instincts might be rusty – “but I don’t think they’re gone”. Sarah, for one, is confident that her latest introduction will eventually pay off. “I think it’s a match made in heaven … I wish a friend would do it for me.” Case studies’ names and some identifying details have been changed",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘I was sure they would fall in love!’ The dos and don’ts of amateur matchmaking,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/12/dos-and-do-nots-of-amateur-matchmaking
5/12/2022,"The first streaming service I subscribed to was Hulu, back in 2009. It was free, with very little content, so the effort-to-reward ratio of setting up a password was almost too extravagant to bother with. I guess Netflix came next – the first subscription service I paid for. Netflix had nothing much on it, either, back in 2011, but at $8 a month, the price point was so tempting it somehow seemed cheaper than free. Then came Amazon Prime Video, included in the annual Prime package. At the time, my monthly cable bill was about $140 a month, and this new model offered a startling promise: not only to slash my bills, but to obviate the need to deal with Time Warner Cable ever, ever again. Well, ha, as they say. Ten years later, from such humble beginnings, I dare not do the maths on my monthly subscriptions. My Netflix bill has almost doubled, Hulu is no longer free, and they have been joined by a clutch of other streaming services that, cheap in isolation, almost certainly add up to more than cable used to be. In our house, as well as those original streamers, we have Disney+, HBOMax and Peacock Premium Plus. I use someone else’s password for Brit Box. I pay for a VPN to get BBC iPlayer. For the longest time, I held out against Apple TV – I didn’t need to see The Morning Show – but this month caved and subscribed, to watch Severance. My line in the sand is Showtime. I nearly did it, for Yellowjackets, but held my nerve and after reports that the series went off a cliff after episode three, am confident that I made the right call. I won’t do Paramount+ and don’t even talk to me about Starz. The whole situation has become ridiculous and every month, glancing at my outgoings, I tell myself something has to go. It’s not a singular frustration. Last month, Netflix reported a first quarter net loss of 200,000 subscribers, with million further losses predicted and an almost 35% plunge in the company’s share price. A few days later, CNN+, a subscription service off-shoot of CNN, announced it would be closing. Consumers are tapped out, financially, and otherwise. Post-pandemic, we are, apparently, going out more, with less time for TV. There’s too much, In the case of Netflix, it’s also a question of quality. In the last few years, the company has vastly overpaid for questionable content, including the laughable $100m it paid for Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry’s whimsical ideas, a spend that has backfired. Last week, it killed Pearl, the cartoon Meghan was apparently working on with – and this makes me laugh every time – David Furnish, and that along with the couple’s other unrealised jottings, will be a footnote in the overall demise of the company. At least Netflix saved on production costs; over the last few years, plenty of expensive garbage has actually made it to screen. (Girlboss, anyone? How about Snowpiercer?) As a result, Netflix announced this week that by the end of the year, it will in all likelihood have introduced ads, as other streamers including Hulu have done. The company also suggested it might crack down on password sharing. Last month, Netflix mentioned during its earnings call that something like 100 million households share their passwords, a fact that might incur a small extra fee when the streamer detects any given account being used at more than one address. This seems reasonable. (I shared my Netflix password with a friend, who shared it with her mother, then changed my password when the streamer cut us off; you can’t watch Netflix on more than two screens simultaneously without paying extra. Now I’m back to sharing with the same friend – not her mother – but am still obliged to call her, occasionally, and yell at her to kick her son off his screen, while she’s on hers, so I can get on mine. There’s a lesson in all this that goes beyond subscription etiquette.) I would cancel Netflix at this point, if I could. As in 2011, there’s nothing on it I want to watch. Among all the bad decisions, however, the streamer has made a very good one: investing in tween shows like Sam & Cat, starring Ariana Grande, and Henry Danger, both of which my seven-year-olds are addicted to. Cutting them off would cause more turmoil than I have the energy for. Also: cake shows. My kids have the entire Disney library at their disposal, but – testament to the quirks of the market and how hard it is to guess what will keep an audience hungry – would rather watch someone make a cake that looks like a shoe.

5/12/2022,"Surging cases of the flu are putting extra demand on emergency departments around New South Wales, with major outbreaks in boarding houses contributing to a doubling in cases in a week. According to NSW Health, 2,000 flu cases were reported in the week to 7 May – up from 1,024 the week before. The state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said there has also been about 60 people hospitalised with flu-like illnesses over the same period, adding further strain to an already struggling system. She urged all people who could to get their flu vaccination, including students in boarding schools who were particularly vulnerable, to do so. “As with Covid-19, boarding schools are a high-risk setting for flu transmission,” she said. “We’re strongly encouraging all students and staff in boarding schools to get their flu vaccine. Boarders with flu should be isolated from others until their symptoms resolve.” Schools with three or more boarders with the flu were told to contact their local public health unit for advice. Health experts have been warning that this flu season would probably be worse than previous pandemic years after historically low transmission rates of influenza last year, largely attributed to border closures and lockdowns. Immunisation Coalition chief executive, Kim Sampson, said it has not been a good start to the flu season because “people have kind of stopped caring”. “[People are] rolling their eyes and don’t really want to know about it,” he said. “There is considerable concern that we’re going to see this escalation in cases progress through the coming months. “As it gets colder, wetter and people stay indoors for longer periods, then we really do expect it to increase. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Key among Sampson’s concerns was the chance of people getting Covid and the flu at the same time, and creeping “vaccine fatigue” leading to lower than usual take-up of the jab. “If we start to see an increase of co-infection, we don’t know what impact that’s going to have on the health system,” he said. NSW’s seniors minister, Mark Coure, said residents 65 and over were eligible for a free flu shot at pharmacies and GPs. He said it was important every year and “especially important this year” given the stubbornly high number of Covid cases in the community still. “We have come a long way and have a strong Covid-19 vaccination rate, but it is important to take any additional steps we can to protect ourselves and others as we head into the winter months,” Coure said. “The flu shot and Covid-19 booster can be given at the same time, so if you are yet to get either, make sure to book in today.”",News/Australia news,Surge in NSW flu cases sparks concern over hospital capacity with Covid numbers high,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/surge-in-nsw-flu-cases-sparks-concern-over-hospital-capacity-with-covid-numbers-high
5/12/2022,"Boris Johnson has refused to rule out the introduction of a windfall tax which would help to relieve pressure on the cost of living crisis. Speaking to LBC’s Nick Ferrari, Johnson said that while he believed a disadvantage of windfall tax would be the impact it would have on investment, the prospect of such a tax was still something to be looked at. Johnson said: “The disadvantage with those sorts of taxes is that they deter investment in the very things that they need to be investing in – new technology, in new energy supply.” When asked by Ferrari whether he would completely rule out a windfall tax, Johnson did not say whether that would be the case, instead saying that he did not “like them”. He added: “I didn’t think they’re the right thing. I don’t think they’re the right way forward. I want those companies to make big, big investments.” The comments come in response to Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP, saying that BP’s plans for investment would not be affected by a windfall tax. Robert Halfon, a Conservative MP and the chair of the education select committee, has joined calls for oil companies to be subject to a windfall tax, labelling their executives as “the new oligarchs”. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “I do think that the government should consider properly a windfall tax. “Oil companies or oil bosses are the new oligarchs – one of them earning a salary over £76m, getting a £4.5m bonus.” Reports suggest that the Treasury was also considering introducing a windfall tax to help ease the cost of living crisis. According to the Daily Mail, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has asked Treasury officials to look into plans to introduce the tax, with a source telling the paper that a one-off levy would be a “no-brainer if the chief executives themselves are saying they have no problem with it”. The proposal of a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas has been a policy the Labour party has pledged over the past few months, with Labour estimating that the tax would reduce the average household energy bill by £200 and would remove VAT from domestic energy bills over a year. Profits on North Sea oil and gas firms are taxed at 30% corporation tax plus a 10% surcharge, however Labour have proposed raising the combined rate to 50%.
