5/2/2022,"A woman accused of driving drunk blamed her GPS for her attempt to drive down stairs at a police station, cops said. The 26-year-old drove through the police department’s garage and across its “pedestrian plaza” in Portland, Maine, the Portland Police Department said in a Facebook post on Saturday, April 30. She then tried to drive her SUV down a flight of stairs to get to the street, police said. The woman told officers that she was following instructions from her GPS, according to police. “But responding officers felt it was her excessive blood alcohol level,” the police department wrote. The driver, who was not named, was “issued a summons for OUI.” “We are fortunate that she didn’t strike anyone and this ended with just a small amount of property damage,” police said. “Please don’t drink and drive.” No other information about the incident had been released as of Sunday, May 1.

5/2/2022,"Retired Admiral James Stavridis said severe missteps have led to deaths among top Russian officers. Stavridis said Russia has so far displayed ""amazing incompetence"" in its invasion of Ukraine. ""In modern history, there is no situation comparable in terms of the deaths of generals,"" he said. James Stavridis, a former NATO supreme allied commander for Europe, said on Sunday that the ""amazing incompetence"" of the Russian military in invading Ukraine has led to an unprecedented number of deaths among generals and other high-ranking officers. Stavridis made the observation about the Russian forces during a WABC 770 AM radio interview with New York businessman John Catsimatidis. ""In modern history, there is no situation comparable in terms of the deaths of generals. … Here, on the Russian side, in a two-month period, we've seen at least a dozen, if not more, Russian generals killed,"" he told Catsimatidis. Stavridis noted that ""not a single general was lost in actual combat"" while the US engaged in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""It's not just the generals being killed,"" he said of the Russian military, but pointed to its dysfunctional logistical practices and middling battle plans, along with the loss of its Black Sea flagship Moskva. ""It's been a bad performance by the Russians thus far,"" he added. Top Russian military leaders who have reportedly been killed include Vladimir Petrovich Frolov, the deputy commander of the 8th Army; Vitaly Gerasimov, the first deputy commander of the 41st Army; and Sergei Sukharev, a top paratroop commander of the 331st Guards Parachute Assault Regiment. Stavridis blasted Russia for committing war crimes throughout the country, starting with ""the illegal invasion of a neighbor and a democracy"" and escalating the battle to include the ""massacring"" of civilians. The commander said that Gen. Alexander Dvornikov — who was installed by Moscow to lead the conflict — is ""well known to Western intelligence as the 'Butcher of Syria.'"" Dvornikov led Russian forces in Syria in 2015, and human rights groups are closely monitoring his efforts. Stavridis said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""creating the expansion of NATO by his unwarranted attack on a neighbor,"" nothing that ""more nations may join NATO as a result of this, notably Sweden and Finland, which [have] very capable militaries."" ""It's not just the NATO alliance. It's the democracies around the world,"" he added, pointing to Japan's strong opposition to Russia's actions. Last month, retired Gen. David Petraeus — a former Central Intelligence Agency director who led the 101st Airborne Division during the War in Iraq in 2003 and commanded US forces in Afghanistan — echoed similar sentiments, telling CNN that Russian military forces were ""just surprisingly unprofessional"" in fulfilling their mission in Ukraine. ""They clearly have very poor standards when it comes to performing basic tactical tasks such as achieving combined arms operations, involving armor, infantry, engineers, artillery and mortars,"" he said. He added: ""We have known for decades that the Soviet system, now the Russian system, has always lacked one of the key strengths of US and Western militaries, which is a strong, professional non-commissioned officer corps.""

5/2/2022,"Evangelical Christians have been a subject of head-scratching puzzlement to many other Americans for years, but the author of a popular book analyzing the group says that’s because their views are formed by an entire subculture that is “invisible” to others. “Most non-evangelicals are not aware of the culture of evangelicalism and just how influential it is on ordinary evangelicals,” said Kristin Kobes Du Mez, author of “Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation,” a New York Times bestseller released in 2020. Du Mez, a professor of history and gender studies at Calvin University — a private evangelical college — said the evangelical subculture begins at an early age, with “youth group culture” and separate systems for education, from home schooling to private Christian schools that begin in kindergarten and extend up through college, like Calvin itself. There is also the “consumer culture” of Christian publishing, Christian radio, Christian music, online media and other inputs. “There's a whole universe out there that really forms the faith of ordinary evangelicals. And it is largely invisible to people outside this community,” Du Mez said in an interview on “The Long Game,” a Yahoo News podcast. “These sources are really formative for shaping their understanding of what is good and true.” One of the arguments in Du Mez’s book is that evangelical Christians believe that their worldview derives from the Bible, when it has in fact been shaped more by American popular culture. “They primarily identify as Bible-believing Christians. … That’s their brand,” she said, arguing that instead, it is “cultural and political allegiances [that] actually shape the ways in which they understand what is biblical.” Evangelicalism, she writes in the book, is a “historical and cultural movement forged over time by individuals and organizations with varied motivations — the desire to discern God's will, to bring order to uncertain times, and for many, to extend their own power."" Du Mez’s book makes the case that American culture, not the Bible, has shaped the beliefs of many American evangelicals, most of them white conservatives, about gender roles, what it means to be strong, and the definition of true power and how to properly use it. The book documents decades of evangelical literature that describes Jesus as a “warrior God.” Du Mez says conservative evangelicalism has long been grounded in views of male domination over women, the idea that the United States is God’s chosen country and that it must be defended at all costs and by any means necessary, and a fear of any threats to white racial identity. “Jesus and John Wayne” has been criticized by numerous conservative religious writers. Some have accused Du Mez of spreading “false teaching,” a serious allegation among evangelicals. But much of the pushback from conservatives has been measured in tone and has included an acknowledgment that the patterns she documents are troubling. Du Mez began writing the book after a recording of Donald Trump’s comments to the host of ""Access Hollywood,"" Billy Bush, was leaked to the public in the weeks leading up to the 2016 presidential election. She was not surprised by how quickly many evangelicals forgave Trump after they heard the bombshell recording, and the second half of her book discusses her theory as to why he did not lose favor with evangelicals after the episode. It explores connections between conservative views on gender roles and how churches handled cases of sexual misconduct and abuse. Du Mez’s argument is that “the more an evangelical leader emphasized male authority and female submission, the more twisted his justifications for any personal scandal.” The list of scandals involving evangelical figures and institutions was long enough when Du Mez wrote her book, but it has grown even longer since. In the past few weeks, celebrity pastors at Hillsong Church have been accused of preying on women and have resigned from their jobs; a renowned pastor, John MacArthur, has been accused of protecting a pedophile who was in leadership in his family of churches; and top former editors at Christianity Today magazine have been accused of sexual harassment in the workplace. Other scandals in recent years include the extensive sexual misconduct allegations against Ravi Zacharias, who was celebrated by evangelicals until his death in 2020 as one of the great champions of the Christian faith. After his death, however, it was reported that he abused his power to solicit and pressure at least 200 women for sexual favors. The Southern Baptist Convention has faced turmoil over the Houston Chronicle’s revelations in 2019 that church officials routinely swept allegations of sexual abuse under the rug. A culture that considered male authority not just as important but as a central pillar of the Christian faith itself led to patterns of protecting abusers and minimizing the effect of their actions on victims, who were usually women and children, Du Mez writes. She concludes in her book that “evangelicals’ response to allegations of abuse in the era of Trump cannot be explained by political expediency alone.” “Rather, these tendencies appear to be endemic to the movement itself,” she writes.",U.S./Yahoo News,"The evangelical world remains confusing to many because it is 'invisible' to them, author says",https://news.yahoo.com/the-evangelical-world-remains-confusing-to-many-because-it-is-invisible-to-them-author-says-090029486.html
5/2/2022,"STORY: Around 50 Ukrainian civilians reached the relative safety of a temporary camp in Russian-held territory on Sunday after being evacuated from a ruined steelworks in Mariupol, where the United Nations said a ""safe passage operation"" was in progress. A convoy of vehicles with Ukrainian number plates, Russian forces and vehicles with United Nations symbols arrived in the village of Bezimenne, located in the Donetsk region, around 20 miles from Mariupol. The city is under Russian control but some fighters and civilians remain holed up in the Azovstal works - a vast Soviet-era plant designed with a labyrinth of bunkers and tunnels to withstand attack. It is one of the first major signs of an evacuation agreement to ease the ordeal of the most destructive siege in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Russia's defense ministry said on Sunday that 46 civilians had left the area around the steel plant the previous day. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi pledged continued support for Ukraine when she met President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in an unannounced visit to Kyiv. ""We believe that we are visiting you to say thank you for your fight for freedom that we are on a frontier of freedom and then your fight is a fight for everyone. So, our commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done."" Russia's defence ministry said on Sunday it had carried out a missile strike on a military airfield near the port city of Odesa, destroying a stock of Western-supplied weapons. It released video showing a missile being launched, which it said was used to carry out the strikes. On Saturday, Ukraine said Russian missiles had knocked out a newly constructed runway at Odesa's main airport. President Zelenskiy pledged in an overnight address to rebuild it. It was unclear if they were referring to the same incident and Reuters could not immediately verify the reports. Moscow has turned its focus to Ukraine's south and east after failing to capture Kyiv in the early weeks of the war. In the northern city of Irpin - one of the main fighting hotspots before Russian troops pulled back - people gathered to honor their military dead, laying flowers on freshly dug graves. Ten year old Saveliy Krotkikh’s father Ivan was killed by shelling. His mother Alla said she was thankful to her husband who she said died defending their city. Her 21-year old son and her husband's brother, who were also in the army, were both wounded trying to help rescue her husband. Tetyana Blyznyuk’s husband also died fighting. She said he always used to bring her flowers. But today, it was her turn to bring them to him.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Civilians evacuated from Ukraine's Mariupol,https://news.yahoo.com/civilians-evacuated-ukraines-mariupol-161726687.html
5/2/2022,"By Andrew Hay MORA, N.M. (Reuters) -Firefighters in New Mexico failed on Friday to pin back the flames of the United States' largest wildfire, which is burning perilously close to a string of mountain villages. The blaze is the most destructive of dozens in the U.S. Southwest that are more widespread and burning earlier than normal in the year due to climate change, scientists say. Thousands of people in the Mora valley, about 40 miles (64 km) northeast of Santa Fe, prepared to evacuate as smoke billowed from forest around the nearby farming community of Ledoux. High winds blew embers over a mile, spreading a wildfire that has scorched about 75,000 acres (30,351 hectares), or 117 square miles (303 sq km), of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains since April 6, destroying hundreds of homes and structures. ""It looks very scary out there,"" incident commander Carl Schwope told a briefing. ""With the rate of spread, it's very difficult for us to get any fire control."" Winds were expected to blow from the south on Saturday, pushing the blaze towards villages such as Mora, as well as the city of Las Vegas, with a population of 14,000, fire officials said. ""It's coming, and it's here,"" said Mora County sheriff's official Americk Padilla, urging residents to evacuate to the towns of Taos and Angel Fire if requested. More than two decades of extreme drought have turned forested mountains and valleys into a tinderbox, said fire expert Stewart Turner. ""It's moving a lot faster than we anticipated,"" Turner said of the blaze. ""This is a very, very serious fire."" Locals lashed out at the U.S. Forest Service for a deliberate, ""controlled burn"" meant to reduce fire risk that inadvertently started part of the blaze. ""The U.S. Forest Service needs to be held accountable,"" said Skip Finley, a former Mora County commissioner, as he loaded his car to evacuate his home.
