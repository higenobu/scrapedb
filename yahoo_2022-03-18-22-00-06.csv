3/18/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - Russia has lost any illusions about ever relying on the West and Moscow will never accept a world order dominated by the United States, which is acting like a sheriff seeking to call all the shots in a saloon bar, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. Western nations have imposed sweeping sanctions across Russia's financial and corporate sectors in response to Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, plunging Russia's economy into its gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. Lavrov, President Vladimir Putin's foreign minister since 2004, said the West's reaction to what Moscow has called a ""special military operation"" had illustrated that the West was completely dominated by the United States and that the European Union was largely powerless. ""If there was any illusion that we could one day rely on our Western partners, this illusion is no longer there,"" Lavrov told Russian state-funded RT in English. Russia would look eastwards, he said. ""What the Americans want is a unipolar world which would not be like a global village but like an American village - or maybe like a saloon where you know the strongest calls the shots,"" Lavrov said. He added that many countries such as China, India and Brazil did not want to be ordered around by ""Uncle Sam"" acting like a sheriff. Russia's invasion has killed thousands of people, displaced more than 3 million and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States, the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Lavrov's defiant response to the West's effort to isolate his country echoed that of Putin, who has indicated in recent days that the post-1991 era of Russian history has drawn to a close and that from now on Moscow will look to China, India and, increasingly, inwards. ""We will now have to rely only on ourselves and on our allies who stay with us,"" Lavrov said. ""We are not closing the door on the West - they are doing so."" As the Soviet Union crumbled and the Cold War ended, many in both Russia and the West hoped that the confrontations which had divided the post-World War Two world would recede or even be bridged. Putin says Moscow's actions in Ukraine were necessary because NATO's enlargement threatened Russia, and that Moscow needed to save Russian-speaking people in Ukraine from oppression. Ukraine casts the invasion as a Russian imperial-style land grab.

3/18/2022,"STORY: South Korea hit a record daily COVID-19 high with more than 600-thousand new cases and 429 deaths, authorities said on Thursday. But the country that once held an aggressive stance against COVID is set to end restrictions. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said the highly infectious Omicron variant was driving the record wave of infections. Despite the numbers, the government shows no sign of rethinking plans to remove almost all social distancing restrictions in coming days and weeks, and public opinion appears to support those moves. Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency spokesman Lee Sang-Won. “There is a limit to curbing the Omicron's high transmission rate with the social distancing rules that we have imposed until now. And the tough distancing rules cause a lot of social burden.” The country has pushed back a curfew on eateries to 11 p.m., stopped enforcing vaccine passes, and plans to drop a quarantine for vaccinated travelers arriving from overseas. A decision on whether to ease further measures, such as a current six-person limit on private gatherings, is expected as early as Friday. South Korea also mandates masks in all public indoor and outdoor spaces. Though it never adopted a ""zero COVID"" policy and never imposed wide lockdowns, South Korea once used aggressive tracking, tracing, and quarantines to control new cases. Nearly 63% of the country's 52 million residents had received booster shots, officials said, with 86% of the population fully vaccinated.",Politics/Reuters Videos,"Amid surge, S.

3/18/2022,"Have you seen the tanker ship anchored just north of the Pell Bridge with the big ""Z"" freshly painted on its smokestack? Those who are up on current events know that ""Z"" has become a symbol for those who support Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A lot of people have taken to Facebook and Twitter and elsewhere online to wonder about the 600-foot oil tanker, called Galassis, parked in Rhode Island waters. One of them is Mike Ritz, executive director of Leadership Rhode Island, who was alerted to the vessel's presence by a professor at the Naval War College who had gone through Leadership RI's program. ""Well, what's going on with that?"" Ritz asked The Providence Journal in an interview Wednesday, after emailing the paper about the ship. ""The port authority could refuse [to let] it dock if it's really a Russian ship."" ""Should we meet at the tavern?"" Ritz asked. He was referring to Sabin Tavern, in Providence, where Colonial Rhode Islanders plotted how to welcome another ship to Narragansett Bay: the British customs schooner Gaspee, which, of course, they burned to the waterline in 1772. Before you grab your pitchfork, though, a few additional facts: The Galissas, which has been in Narragansett Bay about two weeks now, is Greek, not Russian. And the freshly painted ""Z""? It's the corporate logo of the ship's owner, Zeus Lines Management, which recently acquired the tanker. While an exact date of sale couldn't be confirmed immediately, it's so recent that online ship-tracking services still list its previous owner: Benetech Shipping, also a Greek company. This article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: Z on ship Galissas in RI is not connected to Russia Ukraine invasion",World/The Providence Journal,What's the Z? Is the ship in Narragansett Bay supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine?,https://news.yahoo.com/whats-z-ship-narragansett-bay-213207623.html
