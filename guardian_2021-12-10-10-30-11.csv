12/10/2021,"Jagged Little Pill, the third album from the Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, unlocked us. Certified 14 times platinum in Australia and topping the Aria album charts in 1996, it’s packed with anthemic, intelligently introspective and sometimes playful rock tracks. The album gives voice to Morissette’s inner life with such keen emotional insight that her audience – particularly women and people in conflict with polite society – found a soundtrack for their struggle.  Nowhere was that clearer than in You Oughta Know, the album’s alt-rock masterpiece that hurls long-repressed rage at its subject with glorious, full-bodied commitment. It demands a reckoning. More than 20 years later, songs (mostly) from that album, some in full and others in fragments – have been given new life in a musical penned by Diablo Cody (who wrote the film Juno) and directed by Diane Paulus (though Leah Howard is the resident director in Australia). Now they are the music of the Healys, an upper middle-class US family. Mary Jane (Natalie Bassingthwaighte), a perfect-seeming mother with an opiate addiction and long-avoided trauma, is struggling to keep it together. Her husband, Steve (Tim Draxl), is a workaholic with a porn addiction. Son Nick (Liam Head) is a golden child who lacks emotional maturity. And then there’s Frankie (Emily Nkomo), the activist daughter. Frankie, who is black and queer (she and her “best friend” Jo, played by Maggie McKenna, make out while Mary Jane rhapsodises elsewhere about platonic girlfriends) is resentful of her mother’s refusal to engage: insisting that she doesn’t see colour; dismissing Frankie’s activism as a fad; and refusing to call Jo, who is non-binary, by the name that makes them most comfortable. When Nick’s classmate Bella (Grace Miell) is assaulted at a party, both Healy children attend, and the gulf between Frankie’s quest for justice and Mary Jane’s preferred method of ignoring a problem becomes a chasm. There’s nothing to do but sing. Jagged Little Pill desperately wants to be meaningful, tackling more social issues than it can fairly balance (misogyny, racism, transracial adoption, transphobia, classism, disability rights) while also needing to play all the hits you expect to hear in a jukebox musical. It’s an exploration of trauma that tries to touch so many hearts it ultimately risks reaching none. A plethora of protest signs held aloft in the first act feel like cynical set-dressing for sociopolitical relevance. The Broadway production, of which this is a replica, has failed to act upon those values behind the scenes. It also doesn’t seem to trust its own soul – that is, the catalogue of Morissette hits. Tom Kitt’s orchestrations tend to work against the material, cutting into songs and spreading them thin while layering in more conventionality than necessary. Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui’s choreography transforms the ensemble into a witnessing chorus of young people unafraid to take up space and dance with their whole hearts, but they also crash intimate moments, as though the songs themselves aren’t enough to make us feel. This is already theatrical music with a point of view, but the show rarely lets anyone hold and own that view, especially solo. (It also veers into silliness whenever the Healy men are handed their own lyrics; it’s hard to believe the music belongs to them.) Still, there are moments that transcend. When Jo discovers that Frankie has been seeing someone else – a white, cis conventionally attractive guy – we watch them collapse and then rebuild with the only possible song, the jewel of the musical, perhaps its whole point: You Oughta Know. McKenna crafts a journey with it, the most clarifying of the show, and the song rips out of their throat and lands in our guts. In that moment, it doesn’t matter that Jo is backgrounded too often in the story, or that Frankie doesn’t reckon with the harm she’s caused. All that matters is that song in the right hands, setting us all alight. McKenna received a rightful mid-show standing ovation on opening night; later, at curtain call, it was their bow that compelled the majority of the Theatre Royal audience to their feet. Nothing else can touch that moment but, whenever the show comes close, it’s the work of women: Bassingthwaighte’s performance is a bold one, her choices smart and compelling. Nkomo is charismatic and rounds out Frankie’s youthful spirit with the promise of a roar. Miell refuses to betray Bella’s story with easy dramatics, delivering a gorgeously judged, too often backgrounded performance. In the band, it’s Emma Ford’s drums that propel us into new feelings. Jagged Little Pill means so well. It works so hard. Its cast is a treat. If only it weren’t so frustratingly gestural. We shouldn’t be able to see right through it.  Jagged Little Pill plays at Sydney’s Theatre Royal until 19 December. It opens at Melbourne’s Comedy Theatre on 2 January and Perth’s Crown Theatre on 14 May before returning to the Theatre Royal in Sydney from 9 July",Arts/Stage,Jagged Little Pill review – Alanis Morissette musical has moments of silliness and transcendence,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/dec/10/jagged-little-pill-review-alanis-morissette-musical-has-moments-of-silliness-and-transcendence
12/10/2021,"Today, citizens are unwitting participants in a covert policy experiment. It embraces the idea of higher government spending without the necessity of increased taxes. While modern monetary theory (MMT), the doctrine, has obvious appeal for politicians, irrespective of economic religion, the long-term consequences may prove problematic. A state, MMT argues, finances its spending by creating money, not from taxes or borrowing. As nations cannot go bankrupt when they can print their own currency, deficits and debt don’t matter. Accordingly, governments should spend to ensure full employment, guaranteeing a job for everyone willing to work. Alternatively, though not formally part of MMT, governments can fund universal basic income (UBI) schemes, providing every individual an unconditional flat-rate payment irrespective of circumstances.  While no government or central bank overtly advocates MMT, since the 2008 global financial crisis and, more recently, the pandemic, policymakers have adopted many of its tenets by stealth. Popular one-off payments and increased welfare entitlements, which could become permanent, increasingly support economic activity. As the graph below highlights, central banks now buy a high percentage of new government debt, effectively financing this additional spending by money creation. Source: Nick Baker, Marcus Miller and Ewan Rankin (2021 September) Government Bond Markets in Advanced Economies During the Pandemic; Reserve Bank of Australia Bulletin MMT is actually a melange of old ideas: Keynesian deficit spending; the post gold standard ability of nations to create money at will; and quantitative easing (central bank financed government spending) pioneered by Japan. However, there are several concerns about MMT. First, the source of useful, well-compensated work is unclear. While MMT suggests taxes can be used to direct production, government influence over businesses that create jobs is limited. The impact of labour-reducing technology and competitive global supply chains is glossed over. Getting one person to dig a hole and another to fill it in creates employment, but it is of doubtful economic and social value. The woeful record of postwar centrally planned economies, where people pretended to work and the government pretended to pay them, highlights the issues. Second, excess government spending and large deficits financed by money creation risk creating inflation. MMT argues that this is a risk only where the economy is at full employment or there is no excess capacity, and can be managed by fine-tuning intervention. Third, MMT may weaken the currency. Roughly half of Australia’s government and significant amounts of state, bank and business debt is held by foreigners. Devaluation and loss of investor confidence in the stability of the exchange rate would affect the ability to and cost of borrowing overseas and importing goods. The expense of servicing foreign currency debt would rise. Fourth, while available to nation states able to issue their own fiat currencies, it is unavailable to state governments, private businesses or households who are major borrowers in Australia. Fifth, who decides the target employment rate or UBI payment level? Unemployment, inflation and output gaps are difficult to accurately measure in practice. Effects on employment incentives, workforce participation and productivity are untested. How will policymakers control the process or what would happen if MMT failed? The theory delegates management of MMT operations to politicians, rather than unelected economic mandarins. But financially challenged elected representatives may be poorly equipped for the task. Political considerations and cronyism may influence decisions. Sixth, there are implications for financial stability. Lower rates, the result of central bank debt purchases, and inflation fears might drive a switch to real assets, increasing the price of property and shares representing claims on underlying cashflows. It may encourage hoarding of commodities. This exacerbates inequality and increases the cost of essentials such as food, fuel and shelter. Fear of debasement of the value of paper money, in part, is behind unproductive speculation in gold and cryptocurrencies. Seventh, MMT might undermine trust in the currency. Instead of spending the payments, citizens may question a world where governments print money and throw it out of helicopters. Finally, Japan’s use of persistent deficits to boost short-term economic activity and incur government debt (currently more than 260% of GDP, compared with a global average of about 100%) does not prove the effectiveness of MMT. The country’s circumstances are unique and it has been mired in stagnation for three decades with its GDP largely unchanged. MMT’s allure is the irresistible promise of freebies; full employment, unlimited higher education, healthcare and government services, state-of-the-art infrastructure, green energy and “the colonisation of Mars”. But monetary manipulation cannot change the supply of real goods and services or overcome resource constraints, otherwise prosperity and utopia would be guaranteed. While the current game can and will continue for a time, the bill will eventually arrive. The borrowings will have to be paid for out of disposable income, higher taxes or through inflation, which reduces purchasing power, especially of the most vulnerable, and destroys savings. Other than nature’s free bounty, everything has a cost.
