3/14/2022,"Russia’s deadly multiple missile strike on Ukraine’s military base in Yavoriv, less than 15 miles from the border with Poland, was clearly designed to send a message. Not only can Russian forces strike the western limits of Ukraine, killing at least 35 people near where western arms will be crossing into the country, but the Kremlin does not care if US or other volunteer fighters were training there. A day earlier, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov had said its military would treat arms shipments to Ukraine from Nato countries as “legitimate targets”. The facility, well known as a location where Nato forces trained Ukrainians in years before the war began, is near the most direct route between Rzeszow airport, where western arms are being flown in, and the city of Lviv. It is a place where foreign volunteers are said to have congregated as they start training with Ukraine’s armed forces. But even if the base is not used or heavily used for either purpose, it is a site long viewed with suspicion by Russia. Yet there are important limits to the Russian attack. While the proximity of lethal missile strikes to Nato borders may appear unnerving, the US and other allies have taken steps to reinforce and protect Poland’s air defences. The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, announced at the end of last week that two US Patriot missile batteries had been moved into Poland, stationed at Rzeszow. British military sources say a companion, the medium-range Sky Sabre system, already in the country after recent exercises, may be positioned alongside them soon. Despite Rybakov’s rhetoric, a direct Russian attack on a Nato country, with its defences recently reinforced, would be unlikely in any circumstances, but particularly so given how Moscow’s forces are struggling, losing men and materiel in their attack on Ukraine. Nevertheless, the presence of the Patriot batteries is designed to reassure that it will be possible to intercept any stray missiles entering Polish airspace as the Russian offensive against Ukraine gets closer to the west of the country. Romania, another Nato country bordering Ukraine, already has its own Patriot system, while Germany and the Netherlands said a few days ago they would reposition one of their own in another border country, Slovakia. As for the supply of western arms to Ukraine, experts believe it is unlikely to be constrained by a single attack, even one as deadly as that of Sunday morning. The Polish-Ukrainian border is more than 300 miles long, and steps are being taken to conceal the vital supplies as they cross into the country and beyond. It is not realistically possible to cut off or interdict the movement of arms with periodic airstrikes because the territory is too vast. To do so is only practical where Moscow’s forces dominate an area. For now, Russian ground troops, focused on Kyiv and the cities of east, are a long way from Lviv and the western border. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare specialist at the Rusi thinktank, said: “[Vladimir] Putin will struggle to interdict supplies into western Ukraine, but stands a much better chance of eventually encircling and thus cutting off Kyiv, as well as potentially cutting off crossings along the Dnieper River. But this will take time.” Russia’s dominance of the skies, particularly at night, will mean it is likely to engage in more missile attacks and show again it can strike in the west. But these do not in themselves dramatically alter the balance of the war, which is already deadly enough.",News/World news,Russia sends message with Yavoriv strike but attack on Poland unlikely,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/russia-sends-message-with-yavoriv-strike-but-attack-on-poland-unlikely
3/14/2022,"When Lizzie Jarrett was 12 years old, she walked into her grandmother’s home and met a man she didn’t recognise. “I thought, ‘Who’s this muscly, baldy-headed, strapping Aboriginal man?’” she tells the Guardian. “Not realising, you know, it was my father, and that it was also me. I didn’t have that bond, not with him or my own people.” In 1980s Australia, Jarrett, a Bundjalung Gumbaynggirr Dunghutti woman, had been placed in a series of foster homes – “white Christians mostly” – across New South Wales and Queensland after her parents’ marriage broke down. “Shipped around like I was a commodity” from the age of about four to 12, she says. When she was 12 she was placed in the care of her grandmother, who reintroduced her to the father she had been separated from as an infant. “It was like, almost an out-of-this-world experience. It was overwhelming, heartwarming, heartbreaking. It was a complete culture shock. I find it hard to put into words,” she says. It’s a story that has been repeated for generations of Aboriginal families in Australia, and it’s still happening today. In 2019/20, 952 Aboriginal children across NSW were removed from their families, a 2.6% increase on the year prior. In total, there were 6,688 Aboriginal children in what is known as “out-of-home-care” – about 41% of the total number of kids in the system. This is despite Aboriginal children only making up 6% of Australia’s under-18 population. At the same time, another 1,144 Aboriginal children in the state were on a “guardianship order”, a longer-term care arrangement where they remain in state care until the age of 18. Aboriginal children make up about 35% of that cohort. The disproportionate use of separation powers on Aboriginal families is not a secret. Indeed, multiple reports have been commissioned to examine why it is happening. The most significant of those was the Family is Culture report. Commissioned by the NSW government in 2016, the report’s author, Prof Megan Davis, a Cobble Cobble woman, constitutional lawyer and public law expert, examined the case files of 1,144 Aboriginal children between 2015 and 2016. Her findings, released in 2019, described a system not only in deep chaos, but often in breach of its own laws. The report found that at times “children who did not appear to be at risk of harm were removed from their families” by department caseworkers who “regularly” provided “false or misleading” evidence to the children’s court. Her recommendations were sweeping. The government, she said, should introduce an independent Child Protection Commission to oversee the child protection system, the adoption of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care should be banned, and funding in the system should be redirected to early intervention. Three years later though, leaders within the sector say the government is sitting on its hands and Davis, a pro vice-chancellor at the University of NSW, is disillusioned with the response to her report, describing it as an “incredibly disappointing”. “[The] recommendations as a whole are not being adequately implemented,” she tells the Guardian. “Key foundational reforms such as those aimed at increasing independent oversight of the system have been ignored, while the updates provided by the minister in 2021 show that many recommendations remain in preliminary ‘scoping’ stage or are said to be ‘in progress’. After all this time, this is unacceptable.” The government says it has made progress, including completing reviews on 97% of the 3,000 individual case recommendations made by Davis. But structural reforms underpinning the report have so far been ignored. Until now the government has said it would delay considering any recommendations requiring legislative change until a review in 2024, something Davis calls “incredibly distressing”. “There are many aspects of the child protection system that are flawed and in need of reform,” she says. “The decision-making around removals is flawed, the training and qualifications of case workers is inadequate, the department’s record keeping is abysmal, the implementation of the Aboriginal child placement principle is problematic, the removal of newborns in hospitals is traumatic and dangerous, and the Crown’s failure to be a model litigant in child protection cases is deeply worrying.” A bill to be introduced in the lower house of the NSW parliament next week will seek to change that. If passed, it will – for the first time – require magistrates to “presume” an inherent harm in removing a child from their family, including a “serious harm arising from disrupting the child or young person’s connection to his or her culture”. It also seeks to force a reallocation of funding towards prevention by “mandating the provision of support services to prevent entries into care”, and allow courts to dismiss applications for care orders in circumstances where the department cannot show it had considered “alternatives”. Based on Davis’s recommendations and drafted with the support of groups such as the Aboriginal Legal Service and the state’s Aboriginal child and family peak organisation, AbSec, the bill was put forward by the Greens MP David Shoebridge. He says he drafted the bill after the government “refused to make these changes”. “The fact we’re so close to passing this bill is thanks to the many First Nations mothers, grandmothers and advocates who have led this struggle for years,” Shoebridge says. “We are committed to making these much-needed reforms law and we are grateful to the wide range of MPs who have stepped up as co-sponsors. This is a case of politics working. “Successive governments have broken countless promises to stop tearing families apart – it has been 14 years since the apology, yet First Nations children are still being ripped from their families and deprived of their kin and culture.” Last month, the bill sailed through the upper house with a coalition of supporters, including Labor, the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party, the Animal Justice party, and Fred Nile’s ultra-conservative Christian Democrats. The only opponents were One Nation and the government. Natasha Maclaren-Jones, the minister for families and communities, has sought to address criticism of the government’s response to the report since taking on the portfolio in December, by committing to fast-tracking the review of some of the key recommendations. While the government previously insisted it would wait until 2024 to review the recommendations requiring legislative change, Maclaren-Jones says she has instructed the department to begin work on some of those reforms. “One area that the premier and myself have a focus on is closing the gap and, particularly in the Family is Culture report there were a number of things [where] I wanted to know what more we could do in addition to the review in 2024,” she says. “Our aim is to take [reforms] to our parliament this year.” But some changes remain off the table until 2024, including the key recommendation for an independent oversight body, something Maclaren-Jones says would remain “a long-term focus because it’s a complicated change”. “It would require more consultation. What I’m looking at is what are the things that can be done to draft legislation sooner,” she says. Maclaren-Jones insists the government will not support the Shoebridge bill because, she says, more consultation was required with the legal sector. But key figures in the sector disagree. John Leha, the chief executive of AbSec, which is a member of the government’s Knowledge Circle, says that after several reviews of the sector have found systematic issues it is “insanity” for the government to ask for more consultation. “The Family is Culture recommendations built in consultation,” Leha says. “It was a comprehensive, independent, Aboriginal-led review of Aboriginal children in child protection. I do not agree there needs to be more consultation and it’s a reminder that in the two or three years since it was released there has been little to no progress on the report’s implementation. “It is beyond frustrating, it’s insanity. It’s offensive.” After the bill easily sailed through the state’s upper house, supporters are hopeful it will find its way through the NSW legislative assembly – even without government support. The Guardian can reveal that carriage of the bill in the lower house will be taken not by the Greens, but by independent MP Greg Piper, while fellow independents Alex Greenwich and Joe McGirr, and the Shooters party MP Roy Butler, are among its co-sponsors. Still, substantial barriers remain. After the bill passed the upper house One Nation MP Mark Latham appeared in the Daily Telegraph labelling the bill as a “paedophile’s picnic” because, he claimed, recognising harm in removals would prevent them from taking place in cases where they are warranted. While supporters say that’s not true, the Guardian understands Labor will move more amendments when the bill comes to the lower house, confirming that recognition of the inherent harm of removals won’t stop them happening in cases where harm is already occurring. After she reconnected with her father as a 12-year-old, Lizzie Jarrett started to learn about her family’s history. He and his siblings, she discovered, were members of the stolen generations, removed from their mother’s care when they were children. Today, she continues to see her story repeated over and over again. As an advocate for Aboriginal people caught up in the community justice system, she spends her days in courts across Sydney helping mothers seeking restoration orders or just to visit their children. Or she’s at midwife appointments with pregnant women who have been the subject of what’s known in the sector as a “birth alert”, meaning the NSW Department of Communities and Justice is monitoring their pregnancy and, in some cases, will remove the child from their care at birth. “It enrages me,” she says. “I’m a black mother, I have three sons; for all these years I have had to hold my breath and tick every single white box to make sure this didn’t happen to me, a third generation of the government taking my children. “But I see how it still happens every day. We’re told the White Australia policy is gone, that we said sorry for the stolen generations. People think it’s all in the past, it’s OK now, get over it. Until you learn this is the reality today. Black mothers are still having their children stolen.” ",News/Australia news,‘People think it’s all in the past’: push to reform system taking Aboriginal kids from families,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/people-think-its-all-in-the-past-push-to-reform-system-taking-aboriginal-kids-from-families
3/14/2022,"Stories are an integral part of the human condition. Through the power of narrative, humanity is able to organise and contextualise its experiences, allow meaning to be assigned to what is important, and, potentially, change its perceptions of what has come before. The symbiotic relationship between storytelling and sport, therefore, is obvious. It is through the avenue of stories that we chronicle not only what happened in a contest but also why it happened and, more importantly, why we should care. And after a challenging season, this weekend’s A-League Women’s finals certainly delivered a much-needed shot in the arm on the folklore front. Looking at Friday evening’s semi-final between Sydney FC and Melbourne City, for instance, the most basic descriptor is that the Sky Blues defeated City 4-2 to book a place in the ALW grand final in a fortnight’s time. But dive a little deeper and a tale of resilience, heartbreak, excellence, and overwhelming joy reveals itself. Initially, it appeared a parable on hubris: the Sky Blues altering their pre-game routine to stage a presentation for their newly won premiers’ plate only to find themselves down 2-0 after an hour thanks to Hannah Wilkinson’s brace. But buoyed by half-time addition Cortnee Vine, Sydney rallied, halving the deficit through their Matildas attacker in the 73rd minute before snatching a heart-stopping late equaliser through María José Rojas in the 91st. Down to 10 players thanks to Tyla-Jay Vlajnic’s 88th-minute red card, the wilting visitors had no answer as Sarah Hunter and Vine powered their side home in extra-time. Salt was then poured onto wounds when goalkeeper Melissa Barbieri was shown red in the 115th minute. It was a triumph of Vine, of coach Ante Juric, and a triumph of a Sydney ALW program with no equal when it comes to consistency. Of course, good stories need to be engaging, not necessarily fun. Adelaide’s 2-1 defeat against Victory on Sunday did not feature the heart-stopping drama of Friday, but it did provide a classic tale of tragedy: a Reds season which had delivered so much joy and promise cut down by the harsh reality of experience and the mercilessness of Melina Ayres. Finally breaking their 14-year finals drought and hosting the defending champions, Adelaide was the neutral’s favourite team. They were the underdogs, they were young, they were hopeful and they were finally being rewarded for investing and trusting a contingent of local players to take it to the league’s heavyweights. But goals from Lia Privitelli and Ayres were enough for Jeff Hopkins’s side to withstand Nanako Sasaki’s bolt from the heavens and advance to a showdown with City next week. Romance be damned. It was the wisdom of Victory’s experience as they closed the game out, the inability of the inexperienced Reds to find a finals gear and Ayres’ near-supernatural ability to be in the right place at the right time that triumphed. In all, the action set the scene perfectly for a fortnight of finals football to come: a first-ever finals Melbourne Derby now set to decide which team will seek to deny Sydney FC their fourth title. And while to expect ‘the Dub’ to throw anything less than chaos and drama up may, in hindsight, have been folly, it is safe to say the ALW needed some positive and engaging storylines after a challenging regular season. Like its men’s equivalent, the 2021-22 campaign has been heavily disrupted by Covid; waves of fixtures postponed and testing the league’s largely part-time player pool with a fixture wedged into the narrow window remaining in the calendar. Elsewhere, frustrations that the path to greater professionalism and an extended home-and-away season was unclear (made apparent this off-season, per the APL) also dominated an increasingly rancorous discourse. Add to this a disastrous Asian Cup campaign from the Matildas that sucked oxygen out of the conversation, amongst other challenges, and it has been easy for pessimism to frame the narrative. Nonetheless, especially with time, great endings can serve to absolve, or at least obscure, all manner of sins. And after a barnstorming opening round of ALW finals, organisers can take heart from the knowledge that even more plot threads are ready to be pulled on in coming weeks. Reminders of why this competition is capable of enrapturing and the latent potential that still exists within it. Can Sydney equal City’s four ALW champions and once again seize the crown of the undisputed class of the competition? With the legendary Barbieri now 41 years old and out of contract, can City ensure that her unlikely standout season and, possibly, her legendary professional career, ends in a grand final and not in the stands? Can Victory overcome a shaky regular season and shock everyone by going back to back? In the true spirit of tragedy, can this final loss for Adelaide serve as a moment of catharsis that sees them transform into a side that can win these big games? Oh, what stories we have left to tell.",Sport/Football,"A-League Women finals a tale of tragedy, resilience and anti-romance | Joey Lynch",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/14/a-league-women-finals-a-tale-of-tragedy-resilience-and-anti-romance
3/14/2022,"The Black Cop, a short film commissioned by Guardian Documentaries and supported by the BFI Doc Society Fund (awarding National Lottery funding), has won a BAFTA Film Award. Directed and produced by Cherish Oteka, and produced by Emma Cooper, The Black Cop triumphed at the 75th British Academy Film Awards, winning the British Short Film category at a ceremony held in the Royal Albert Hall, London (Sunday 13 March). The Black Cop is the first Guardian Documentary to win a BAFTA Film Award. It follows recent Guardian Documentaries success with Colette, which won an Oscar last year for best documentary short, and an Oscar nomination in 2019 for Black Sheep. The Black Cop’s executive producers for the Guardian are Ekaterina Ochagavia and Jess Gormley, and Lisa Marie Russo for the BFI Doc Society Fund. The commissioning editor is Lindsay Poulton, the Guardian’s head of documentaries. The Black Cop, available to watch on the Guardian website now, is an intimate portrait of Gamal ‘G’ Turawa, an ex-Metropolitan police officer, who explores his memories of racially profiling and harassing Black people and homophobia in his early career. Now an openly gay man, Turawa’s story is a multi-layered one and sits in the centre of three pivotal moments in recent British history, from the Black communities’ resistance of oppressive policing, to the push for LGBTQIA equality and the aftermath of the west African ‘farming’ phenomenon, where white families took care of Black children outside the remit of local authorities. Cherish Oteka, director and producer of The Black Cop, says: “Winning a BAFTA Film Award means the world to me and is a huge collective win for the many underrepresented communities that The Black Cop speaks to as well as the entire team that brought this film to life. It’s so heart-warming that audiences have connected with The Black Cop in such a meaningful way and winning best short film is more than I could ever have hoped for. A massive thank you to the teams at The Guardian and the BFI Doc Society Fund for believing in the idea and supporting me throughout the journey.” Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief, Guardian News & Media says: “This award from BAFTA is a huge achievement, and a tribute to the talented filmmakers who have produced such a powerful and stirring documentary. I’m delighted that the Guardian’s global platform played a part in helping Gamal’s story reach audiences. The Black Cop is the Guardian’s first BAFTA Film Award and joins several other award-winning short films in our acclaimed Guardian Documentaries strand. Congratulations to all involved.” Lindsay Poulton, head of documentaries, Guardian News & Media, says: “I’m thrilled that The Black Cop has received this recognition from BAFTA and am proud that Guardian Documentaries was able to support Cherish and the filmmakers to tell this important story of identity and acceptance. The Guardian has been at the forefront of commissioning ambitious short form documentaries for audiences around the world, and The Black Cop is a great reflection of our wide-ranging documentary strand, helping to bring different perspectives and new ways of thinking to compelling and vital journalism.” Lisa Marie Russo. executive producer for the BFI Doc Society Fund, says: “​​We are over the moon that The Black Cop has won the BAFTA Short Film Award, in a category with stiff competition from fiction and doc titles. It is a testament to the power of the genre, and the filmmaking talent of director Cherish Oteka and producer Emma Cooper, who tell an urgent and engaging story, which speaks to our time. And many thanks to Gamal Turawa for speaking truth to power.” Guardian Documentaries have received critical acclaim around the world, playing at major film festivals and winning numerous awards, including an Oscar, a BAFTA Film Award and a Grierson, plus accolades at Cannes, Sheffield Doc/Fest and others. The Black Cop has screened at Raindance, British Shorts Film Festival, Aesthetic Short Film Festival, Out On Film, Atlanta’s International LGBTQ Film Festival, The Pan African Film & Arts Festival, American Black Film Festival, and Leeds International Film Festival.

3/14/2022,"Russian soldiers have shot people dead in the street as they took over Ukrainian villages, according to fleeing residents. Soldiers shot randomly at buildings, threw grenades down roads and went from house to house confiscating phones and laptops, witnesses said. Online groups created for family members or friends looking for information about people in affected areas are receiving hundreds or even thousands of requests a day. One witness, Mykola, described how soldiers arrived in Andriivka, a village to the east of Kyiv. “They threw grenades down the street. One man lost his leg and the next day this person died,” he said. “They then came down the central street and started shooting at the windows and hit one woman. Her children managed to hide.” Mykola lived within walking distance of his brother, Dymtro. “My brother came out the house with his hands in the air. They beat him and then executed him in the street,” he said. Dymtro’s wife said she saw the killing of her husband from a window. She said she also witnessed their neighbour being killed in the same manner. Dymtro’s daughter believes both were shot because they had earlier helped the Ukrainian army as volunteers. Mykola said they wanted to bury his brother, but his wife feared the soldiers would shoot them. “The next day they went house by house, confiscating phones and laptops,” he said. At this point, 3 March, there was no electricity. “Those who came into our house behaved OK. But they told us that it’s good you have a cellar, collect some water, because you’re going to be bombed for six days.” The Russians would not let them bury Dymtro in the graveyard, so they buried him in the garden. Dymtro’s daughter, Yulia, said that soon afterwards a mortar attack began and the neighbouring house started to burn. A Russian soldier told them to wait behind their tank because it was safer, she said. “We were terrified. We didn’t understand whether it was Russians shooting or our guys. Everything after that was a blur. We ran home and barely made it under constant mortar attack.” On 8 March, Mykola, his family and Dymtro’s family decided to leave, as they had no phone signal and no electricity. Dymtro’s wife approached the soldiers to ask for permission, but the soldiers starting shooting in the air. Mortar attacks were also ongoing, so the family decided to leave without permission. “As we were leaving, they were shooting at our car, even though we had [the word] ‘children’ written on bits of paper in the windows. But evidently they weren’t particularly interested in that fact,” said Yulia. The father of a family that left with Mykola’s group was shot at when a soldier saw him calling someone from his garden, Yulia said. “How can you understand that people could be killed just for ringing their relatives to say that they’re alive?” When the Russians entered Druzhnya, another village west of Kyiv, they shot at the houses, according to Serhiy, who has since fled his home. “I think they did this so that they weren’t attacked with molotov cocktails,” he said. “So all of those houses along the main road from Bordyanka to Makariv were hit and some people died. Then they started to go house by house. They killed a teacher who was outside feeding her chickens,” Serhiy said. “They told people not to go outside and to stay at home.” Serhiy said the soldiers told him: “If you see us, don’t make any sudden moves, put your hands above your head.” He added: “There’s absolutely no connection, we still have relatives there and we cannot contact them. They took some people’s phones, and they temporarily took other people’s phones to check that they hadn’t photographed anything or filmed anything.” On 10 March the Russians agreed to a facilitate a humanitarian corridor to evacuate residents from Borodyanka and the neighbouring villages. According to Serhiy, the bombing was even heavier that day. Serhiy’s brother-in-law cycled along a forest dirt road to check if it was clear of Russians, which it was. The family then drove out through the forest. One Telegram group for relatives searching for people still in the affected areas, run by a well-known Ukrainian TV presenter, has had more than 60,000 inquiries since it launched on 26 February, and now receives about 1,000 new requests a day. Community Facebook groups for the affected areas are full of hundreds of desperate appeals from relatives, hoping that someone in the area might have signal and be able to tell them if their loved ones are still alive. Valeriy, 34, HR professional who lived in Kyiv, was at his country house in the village of Lypivka when the war started. After the Russians moved into a neighbouring town, he started receiving messages on a community group from relatives of people in the town who were no longer able to reach their family members. “The messages were like: ‘Please help me find Ivan Ivanovych,’ with a photograph and address. And the number of messages just built and built, and I became scared,” Valeriy said. “Then started to come information that they were destroying the multi-storey buildings in Borodyanka with people in them using tanks.” From 1 March there was no phone signal or electricity but there was some patchy signal in the fields, he said. “Either they somehow blocked the signal, or it was because of the lack of electricity.” He managed to escape under shelling on 3 March. *Names have been changed.",News/World news,"Tanks, bombs, shootings: Ukrainians describe Russian takeover of villages",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/tanks-bombs-shootings-ukrainians-describe-russian-takeover-of-villages
3/14/2022,"There cannot have been a better way to sum up the rotten state of English football than the moral vacuum that lay at the heart of this strange and upsetting occasion at Stamford Bridge, where a capacity crowd turned up to watch one club with a disqualified owner take on another backed by the public investment fund of a nation which executed 81 people on Saturday. This was a dark day for anyone who cares about the game’s soul. No amount of sportswashing could make the putrid air hanging over this fixture disappear. Not when some Chelsea fans were still determined to belt out their boorish chants of support for Roman Abramovich, a man described by the UK government as a pro-Kremlin oligarch with long-term links to Vladimir Putin, and the sight of flags of Saudi Arabia in the Shed End served as further evidence of soft power at play, making Newcastle look like little more than a useful tool for a repressive regime hoping to cleanse its reputation through sport. This behaviour, this farcical cognitive dissonance, cannot be defended any more. There was defiance spilling over into sheer blinkered arrogance, witnessed when the home crowd roused themselves in the second half and sang in praise of Abramovich, even now they have seen the government accuse him of being involved in destabilising Ukraine by supplying steel which may have been used to build Russian tanks (a claim that has been denied). A reminder: Abramovich is no hero. Nineteen years ago he turned up out of the blue to buy a football club and transform it with his billions. He was a mystery back then and it is only now that Ukraine has been subjected to Russia’s monstrous invasion that the source of Abramovich’s wealth has been openly questioned so widely, leading to the sanctions that have left Chelsea fretting about falling into administration after being granted a special licence by the government to continue operating. These are undoubtedly unnerving times for the world champions. For almost two decades they have known only success. It is all down to Abramovich and his impact was even felt in this tense win over Newcastle, the decisive goal arriving when Kai Havertz controlled a sumptuous pass from Jorginho and blasted a volley into the net, £112.5m worth of talent combining to give Chelsea a victory that keeps them on track to finish in the top four. But still, it is time to be thankful for the memories and move on. To take seriously the allegations that bloodstained money has funded this project; to remove the “Roman Era” banner hanging in the Matthew Harding Stand and accept that continuing to back this disgraced billionaire will only make the outside world think that Chelsea fans care more about their team than Ukrainian victims. Similar principles apply to Newcastle fans, who were in boisterous spirits after seeing their side spend their way out of relegation trouble. They looked to make light of Chelsea’s new era of austerity, branding them the “Bankrupt boys” and singing “We’re richer than you”, but there was a staggering lack of awareness to them chanting about Abramovich being a “war offender”. Had they not heard about Saudi Arabia’s actions in Yemen? Or did they simply not care? Ignorance is not an excuse. After the game Eddie Howe was pressed repeatedly on Newcastle’s ownership. Asked about those 81 executions, he made his position clear: he was but a humble football manager and was only there to talk about the game. Never mind where the money comes from. Let’s just talk about whether Newcastle were unlucky not to get a penalty in the second half. Of course the point Howe clumsily missed is that the football was not a distraction on Sunday. The focus was not on Havertz’s lovely finish, Timo Werner’s errant first touch or Newcastle’s improved defending. The game cannot escape the geopolitical edge now. Just look at Chelsea, where they have had to shut the club shop, stop selling programmes and cap travel costs for away games after being placed under heavy restrictions because of the sanctions on Abramovich. None of this was normal and the only hope is that the events of the past two weeks serve as a reckoning for English football: a realisation that the Premier League must develop a spine and be stronger on who is deemed a fit and proper person to own a club. It is time to start asking proper questions.

3/14/2022,"A Russian default on its debts after western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine is no longer “improbable”, but would not trigger a global financial crisis, the head of the International Monetary Fund said on Sunday. The Washington-based fund’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said the sanctions imposed by the United States and other nations were already having a “severe” impact on the Russian economy and would trigger a deep recession there this year. The war in Ukraine will also drive up food and energy prices, leading to hunger in Africa, she added. Georgieva told CBS’s Face the Nation programme: “In terms of servicing debt obligations, I can say that we no longer think of Russian default as an improbable event. Russia has the money to service its debt, but cannot access it. What I’m more concerned about is that there are consequences that go beyond Ukraine and Russia.” Last week, the World Bank’s chief economist, Carmen Reinhart, warned that Russia and its ally Belarus were “mightily close” to default. Asked whether a Russian default could trigger a financial crisis around the world, Georgieva said: “For now, no.” The total exposure of banks to Russia amounted to around $120bn, an amount that while not insignificant, was “not systematically relevant”, she said. Last week, she said the IMF would downgrade its previous forecast for 4.4% global economic growth in 2022 as a result of the war. Separately, Russia said on Sunday that it was counting on China to help it withstand the blow to its economy from sanctions, but the US has warned Beijing not to provide that support. The Russian finance minister, Anton Siluanov, said Moscow was unable to access $300bn of its $640bn in gold and foreign exchange reserves, but still held part of its reserves in the Chinese currency, the yuan. “And we see what pressure is being exerted by western countries on China in order to limit mutual trade with China. Of course, there is pressure to limit access to those reserves,” he said. “But our partnership with China will still allow us to maintain the cooperation that we have achieved, and not only maintain, but also increase it in an environment where western markets are closing.” Russia is due to make two interest payments on 16 March. However, it will have a 30-day grace period to make the coupon payments. Siluanov said on Sunday that it would be “absolutely fair” for Russia to make sovereign debt payments in roubles until its foreign exchange reserves were unfrozen, according to Interfax. The IMF head expressed concern about the spillover effects from the war on the immediate neighbours of Russia and Ukraine because they have close trade relations with both countries, and about the large numbers of of Ukrainians fleeing the conflict, Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. The IMF is also “very worried” about countries that have yet to recover from the Covid-induced economic crisis, which will be hit hard by the surge in wheat and other commodity prices. “For them, this shock is particularly painful,” Georgieva said. Other countries are very dependent on energy imports from Russia. “Yes, war in Ukraine means hunger in Africa, but war in Ukraine also has social implications for many, many countries through the three channels,” she said. “One, commodity prices, energy, grains, fertilisers, metals … the impact that has on inflation and in countries where inflation has already been high, this is dramatic.” Georgieva gave Brazil and Mexico as examples. Surging inflation will force the authorities to tighten financial conditions, bringing further hardship to people. However, economic growth remains robust in countries like the US that have been quick to recover from the pandemic, she told CBS.",News/World news,"Russian default on debts no longer ‘improbable’, says IMF head",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/russian-default-on-debts-no-longer-improbable-says-imf-head
3/14/2022,"On a mild, peppy, boisterous afternoon at the Emirates Stadium Arsenal made it five Premier League wins in a row to reclaim fourth spot ahead of Manchester United.* Thomas Partey was assertive in central midfield, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli hugely impressive as the wide players in that voraciously hungry press-and-move attack. It is a mark of Arsenal’s progress since the turn of the year that there were times during this 2-0 defeat of an under-strength Leicester where they almost seemed to be having too much fun with those attacking combinations, trying to dance the ball into the net in the grand modern-day Arsenal tradition. This is, after all, the youngest squad in the Premier League. They probably deserve to have a little fun, and that quality that has been key to Arsenal’s surge of form, the sense that Mikel Arteta has created both a clear tactical system, and more importantly, a vibe, a feeling of something juiced with its own youthful energy. The past no longer lingers around this place. Or at least, not while they continue to win. And this was the start of a key period in the slog towards the season’s end game. Arsenal have benefited from the combined effects of a pared-back schedule and a young, biddable squad. One game a week. Time to groove and drill. People under the age of 25 who actually listen to you. What more could a furiously meticulous details-manager want? That favourable terrain has now ramped up into an intense triple-header: this game, Wednesday and Saturday, with Liverpool and Aston Villa respectively a genuine test for what is still a sparse-looking squad. Leicester may have had their thoughts elsewhere, resting Youri Tielemans and Wilfred Ndidi from the start for Rennes on Thursday. Arteta went with three of his fabulous four, an Ødegaard-Martinelli-Saka attacking tripod revolving fluently behind Alexandre Lacazette. And steadily those patterns began to assert themselves against a Leicester team that sat deep. With nine minutes gone Saka produced a stunning piece of skill, pulling a long diagonal pass out of the sky on the run with the tip of his toe, then sniping back inside, and forcing a corner. Martinelli’s kick was hard and flat – and headed straight in at the near post by Partey. It looked a little too easy. Partey took the space and refused to be shifted. His influence has been profound in the current run. Here he started in a deep midfield double-bolt with Granit Xhaka, who has been marauding a little further forward in a kind of Kanté-lite king-of-the-turnover role. And for a while Arsenal swamped Leicester and pinged neat, zingy triangles just in front of the back four. With 17 minutes gone Partey hit the post with a high-craft curling shot dug out of a tight spot. Moments later Saka slalomed through the left-hand side of the Leicester defence and put Martinelli in for a shot at goal. This Arsenal attack has been so aggressively drilled in winning the ball back in that band of grass 40 yards or so from goal, and they did it repeatedly here, hunting in carefully tessellated packs. It took 23 minutes for Leicester to construct anything resembling an attack, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall measuring a lovely pass over the top for Harvey Barnes, whose stab at goal was smothered by Aaron Ramsdale. And six minutes later Ramsdale produced something spectacular, leaping to claw away with his left hand a close-range header from Barnes. It was a wonderful, cinematic save. He probably shouldn’t have had a chance to make it. With 29 minutes gone there was a moment of slightly overblown drama as Gabriel collapsed in a writhing heap after some minor contact from Kelechi Iheanacho’s gloved finger. And by now James Maddison was starting to bring his influence to bear, working cleverly with Nampalys Mendy to wrest some control in those central areas. But Arsenal emerged re-energised after the break and asserted that early pressure once again, with both wide attackers cutting inside to make a tight five in the centre. Martinelli jinked and feinted almost to the goalline and forced a desperate block. And just before the hour mark there was an extended VAR drama as Kasper Schmeichel saved well from Ben White as the red shirts swarmed in on goal. The ball bounced out to Partey and his header was blocked on the line. After much zooming and rewinding the cameras detected a fine deflection off the fingertips of Caglar Soyuncu. It was a clear penalty, brilliantly detected by the technology. Lacazette slowed in his run-up, then smashed the kick into Schmeichel’s top right-hand corner to make it 2-0. At that point Arsenal had taken 15 shots at goal to Leicester’s three, and had begun to thrum up through the gears. Emile Smith-Rose came on for the final 10 minutes and immediately offered his own kind of scurrying creativity. For Leicester defeat here interrupted a promising run of four straight wins, although the season seems to be focused for now on the glories of the Europa Conference. Arsenal spent the whole second half looking like a team playing with something in reserve. The next week could tell us exactly how much.",Sport/Football,Partey and Lacazette punish Leicester to lift Arsenal back into fourth,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/13/arsenal-leicester-premier-league-match-report
3/14/2022,"Young environmental activists have disrupted the red carpet at the Baftas to call for more attention to the climate crisis and for celebrities to speak out about it. Just before 4pm on Sunday, a group of about two dozen activists prepared to storm the entrance to the red carpet VIP area of the Royal Albert Hall in London, but were prevented from getting inside by police and security. Four activists were able to gain access to the red carpet by getting tickets after entering a lottery. They took off their shirts to reveal T-shirts reading “Just Stop Oil”, and chanted: “Just look up, just stop oil,” in a reference to the recent film, Don’t Look Up. The satire is in the running for four awards and the attempt by scientists in the film to warn of impending armageddon due to a comet has been compared to experts’ ignored warnings over the climate crisis. Other activists were able to blockade the entrance to the red carpet area. VIPs had to enter the event on foot after the activists barred the road leading into the cordoned-off area. The action comes weeks ahead of a planned Just Stop Oil campaign, which insiders say has recruited hundreds of young activists to blockade oil and gas infrastructure sites in the UK. Activists from Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain have said they will support the campaign. Protesters said they were targeting the Baftas to urge celebrities to use their platforms to speak out about the climate emergency. Claudia, 23, said: “I am here supporting Just Stop Oil because I am absolutely terrified about our future. Last year, the UK government’s former chief scientific adviser warned us that what we do within the next three to four years will determine the future of humanity. “Yet our government, knowing this, knowing that continuing to support the oil industry is a death sentence for us all, remains determined to drag us down this path of suffering and destruction. And the mainstream media doesn’t care. “So we are asking those with power and influence to use it, to do what is necessary, and use their platform to demand the government just stop oil. We have to act like our lives depend on it, because they do.” Ahead of the action, activists met at Queen Catherine’s temple in Kensington Gardens near to the Royal Albert Hall for a briefing, where they discussed how the action would take place and what tactics they would use. The protesters discussed details such as how to maintain non-violent discipline, whether to “go floppy” when arrested or tackled, and the best ways to apply superglue – “getting your fingertips really close together” to make it more difficult for removal teams to soak solvent between them.",News/Environment,Environmental activists disrupt Bafta red carpet in London,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/13/environmental-activists-disrupt-bafta-red-carpet-in-london
