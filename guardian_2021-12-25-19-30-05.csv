12/25/2021,"In a pastoral scene that has changed little in centuries, farmers wearing red woollen ponchos gather on a December morning in a semicircle to drink chicha, made from fermented maize, and mutter an invocation to Pachamama – Mother Earth – before sprinkling the dregs on the Andean soil. Singing in Quechua, the language spread along the vast length of the Andes by the Incas, they hill the soil around plants in the numerous small plots terraced into a patchwork up and down the Peruvian mountainside.  The Andes sustains one of the most diverse food systems in the world. Through specially adapted farming techniques, these farmers conserve a great variety of maize, also known as corn, and other biodiverse crops that could be key to food security as global heating causes a more erratic climate. Maize has been grown in Lares, near Cusco, for thousands of years, in one of the highest farming systems in the world. Choquecancha and Ccachin communities specialise in more than 50 varieties of the cereal in a myriad of different sizes and colours. “In the old days, the Incas grew these ecotypes and now we continue the path set down by our ancestors,” says Juan Huillca, a conservationist in Choquecancha, a tiny mountainside village. On a blanket are ears of corn ranging in colour from faintly yellowed white to deep purple. All have thick kernels and evocative names. Yellowish corncobs with red tinted kernels are called yawar waqaq (blood crier). White cobs flecked with grey, whose toasted kernels are served as crunchy canchita with Peru’s flagship dish ceviche, are more prosaically called chuspi sara (small corn). Historians believe what is now the world’s most widely grown cereal crop was first domesticated by people in modern-day Mexico about 10,000 years ago and subsequently spread south down the spine of the Andes to reach Peru about 6,000 years ago. Long before the climate crisis, these farmers’ ancestors adapted to growing crops in different niche ecosystems, from icy mountain peaks to sunny valleys. “In this landscape it would be difficult to produce just one variety of one crop, because in one year you can have frosts, hail, droughts or torrential rain,” says Javier Llacsa Tacuri, an agrobiodiversity expert who manages a project to safeguard the farming techniques, which have been identified as one of a handful of globally important agricultural heritage systems. “With a few varieties, you could not face a farming year, so the response is to have many varieties. The frosts and hailstorms have always occurred and their ancestors knew how to face them,” he says. With more than 180 native domesticated plant species and hundreds of varieties, Peru has one of the world’s richest diversity of crops. Backed by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, the project supports the farmers to preserve the native species, and Llacsa Tacuri and colleagues help find markets for the multicoloured corns. “Peru is one of eight places in the world which is considered a centre of origin for agriculture,” says Llacsa Tacuri. “The first inhabitants and their descendants – the peasant farmers who are here – started their adaptation to this landscape more than 10,000 years ago.” Huillca says his village and its neighbours are already feeling the climate crisis. “Diseases like stem rust or blight arrive, sometimes we get frost or hail. That’s why we have our seed bank in order not to lose our maize ecotypes, so we can recover what we’ve lost and resow those varieties,” he says. In a simple farmhouse in Ccachin lies the genetic heritage of thousands of years of crop domestication and variation. Dozens of types of dried kernels are stored in plastic containers for rainy days. “But many young people migrate to the city because this doesn’t generate much income,” Huillca adds. “What we do doesn’t bring enough income to sustain the family, so they move to the city.” Sonia Quispe, a maize conservationist in Choquecancha, says the harvest is half what it would normally be. “With the climate crisis, there’s less harvest, but we substitute our diet with potatoes,” she says. “It’s important to work with the different varieties of maize for our food security. With global heating, there are varieties that are more resistant to illnesses and pests.” Quispe can identify the variety of three-month-old maize shoots from the stalks. She explains that the ones with red at the base will produce red-tinted cobs with a bitter taste that repels pests, which are moving further up the mountain as the sun becomes more intense. Julio Cruz Tacac, 31, a yachachiq, or farming teacher, who returned to Ccachin after studying in Cusco, has seen weather patterns change. “When I was little, the sun didn’t shine with such intensity, the temperature was mild,” he says. “It’s as if we live in an Eden in terms of food products, we have everything to hand,” he says of his childhood home. This is in contrast to city life, where “everything is money”, he says, and which became even harder during the Covid-19 pandemic – Peru had the world’s highest Covid mortality rate. The custom of ayni, reciprocal communal work, remains in these remote villages, but a bartering form of exchange, known as trueque, has been hit by the pandemic’s economic impact. “We go to the market and we trade with the fruit and coca from the farmers in the valley,” says Genara Cárdenas, 55, from Ccachin. “But now with the pandemic the people don’t want to barter, they want money.” Financial pressures have affected the village’s traditional way of life, but their crops have helped them remain self-sufficient despite the economic problems. Even so, the climate crisis presents new challenges, says 55-year-old farmer Victor Morales. “When I was young, the rains, the frost, all had their time. But today everything has changed. We had many types of potatoes and maize, now we have varieties which are more resistant to climate change.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,A seed for all seasons: can ancient methods future-proof food security in the Andes?,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/25/a-seed-for-all-seasons-can-ancient-methods-future-proof-food-security-in-the-andes
12/25/2021,"It was a year of promises and postponements, of dodgy mask-wearing in the stalls – and of sudden soarings. It was no surprise that Rebecca Frecknall’s spectacular production of Cabaret, with Jessie Buckley and Eddie Redmayne, should prove one of the big excitements of the year – and one of the most expensive. But who in the Pre-Puppet Era (before The Sultan’s Elephant and War Horse) would have thought that a three-and-a-half-metre-tall creature made of wicker and fabric would prove such a powerful reminder of how the theatre can stir hearts and stretch eyes?  Little Amal, the child-refugee puppet who walked from the Syrian-Turkish border to Manchester, was pelted with stones in Greece, danced in Trafalgar Square, became an ambassador for political change – and for the imagination. She was a reminder of how theatrical truth does not depend on naturalism: as were the small white daemon puppets that lit up the stage like Chinese lanterns in Bryony Lavery’s adaptation of Philip Pullman’s La Belle Sauvage, and the marvellous driftwood creations that scuttled and sashayed through Lolita Chakrabarti’s version of Life of Pi. Ingenious adaptations of prose and verse provided some of the best theatrical nights. Often with a feminist twist. Zadie Smith brilliantly reworked Chaucer in The Wife of Willesden – showing there is no new lewdness under the sun and allowing Clare Perkins to display her tremendous acting gifts. Emma Rice brought swagger and musicality to her version of Wuthering Heights, with Nandi Bhebhe gusting and gutsy as the spirit of the moor. And in Pride and Prejudice* (*sort of), Isobel McArthur reworked Jane Austen from the viewpoint of her unnamed servants, rocking the plots karaoke-style, with Lizzie Bennet crooning You’re So Vain to Darcy. In further female claiming of the stage, Cush Jumbo triumphed when she became Hamlet in Greg Hersov’s jumbled production: thrillingly intertwining derangement and pretended madness, she was a perfect prince. After a surfeit of lockdown Zoom drama, I met no one who was much looking forward to a big Covid play. We were spared that – and treated to much longed-for buoyancy – but directors did not flinch from examining harsh times. Nicolas Kent and Richard Norton-Taylor’s staging of the Grenfell Tower inquiry was a revelation: verbatim, detailed testimony; functional design; acting so transparent that the word performance seemed out of place; an evening that made you long for similar treatments of some of our current disgraces. The Lyric Hammersmith staked a claim to be at the forefront of new writing. Under the overarching title Out West, three short plays by Tanika Gupta, Simon Stephens and Roy Williams, directed by Rachel O’Riordan and Diane Page on a bare wood set, had a long reach, speaking strongly of past and present prejudice. Modern dilemmas also glinted in surprising places. In Blanche McIntyre’s production of Measure for Measure, a ruler was shown holding himself and his citizens to entirely different standards. Carousel at Regent’s Park Open Air theatre and, at Chichester, South Pacific were rethought musically and visually; the lushness of their scores was shown to fly against the bitter depiction of violent men and racism. At the end of the year, James Graham again proved why he has become so vital for the theatre. In Best of Enemies he produced a marvel of a play – which looked back to the 60s and forward to the future, examining the point at which debate turns to poisonous rant. It was a buoyant example of what he has been advocating during the pandemic: work that bowls over boundaries – financial, geographical, racial, psychological.

12/25/2021,"In uncertain times, there’s a lot to be said for Christmas traditions. Tastes and smells, like familiar tunes, can instantly transport you back to childhood. Food matters, especially at Christmas – and tradition is part of the reason why it packs such a punch. Let’s start with the stocking. Gone are white sugar mice and candy cigarettes, replaced by gummy bears and chocolate reindeer poo. But it’s good to know the traditional tangerine – usually left to rot under the bed – continues to have its place for my own kids. The chocolate coins remain. The story goes that three sisters unable to afford a dowry were doomed to be sold into loveless marriages. Wishing to keep his donation anonymous, and inspired to act, the 4th-century Saint Nicholas secretly dropped coins down the chimney into stockings they’d left drying by the fire. I’m not sure anyone knows how it turned out for the girls, but clearly a colossal fail for St Nick’s wish to remain anonymous.  Now to dinner. There’s an end-of-year obsession with eating foods said to bring prosperity. Steal a coin-like silver scale from your carp on Christmas Eve, place it in your wallet, and there it will trick other money into joining it. Luckier still are lentils which resemble piles of pennies, while green vegetables are a symbol of wealth and luck in nearly every culture going. There’s the sixpence added to the Christmas pudding batter, which, provided you don’t break a tooth, should grant good fortune for the coming year. In fact, the Christmas pudding is possibly the most ancient of the modern traditions. Starting out in medieval times as an unappetising meat, spice and fruit porridge, over the years it’s been outlawed, reinstated, immortalised by Charles Dickens, and set on fire time and again. Christmas traditions – like with the pud – are forever changing, not least when families merge. Recognising all faiths, dietary requirements and television programming preferences can be an undertaking. Supposedly rational adults will suddenly become hysterical because the gravy’s not in the special Christmas jug, while the smallest of changes have ripple effects. A menu swap to beef means no bones for turkey soup. Think of the sacrifice the turkeys made to get to your plate. Back in the day, farmers would walk the fowl from Norfolk to London: to protect their feet on the 100-mile hike, they crafted the birds leather shoes. It was notoriously harder to cajole a goose into wearing these shoes so their feet, instead, were dipped in tar and feathers – and the phrase “to shoe a goose” was born, marking a futile task. These days, we’re broadly more discerning about how our food gets to our plate. But for those who can’t be bothered with the faff, a solution born of the pandemic may well change Christmas dinner for ever. At-home dining kits are available for every festive menu imaginable and encompass every dietary requirement, crafted by top chefs with fresh, local ingredients and delivered direct to your door. Just put it in the oven and watch YouTube for the plating instructions. If you go for a home deli hamper, you don’t even need to do that. Admittedly, they can be a little pricey; anything from £20 for a mince pie kit to several hundred pounds for a seafood extravaganza. Truth be told, I would miss the holiday kitchen. The smell of oranges studded with cloves, ready for mulling wine, the sight of lopsided gingerbread houses with runny icing glue. There are, of course, traditions definitely worth losing. Being force fed 12 mince pies to ensure a year of happy months – a watered-down superstition that harks back to the early 1800s, when mince pies could only be eaten during the 12 days of Christmas and, for the full lucky effect, one each in 12 different houses. Then there’s the headache-inducing buck’s fizz that my mother insists we drink on Christmas morning. Originally created in 1921 at Buck’s Club in London, buck’s fizz is traditionally made with one part orange juice to three parts champagne; for some unfathomable reason, it suddenly became a hit in the 1980s and is still around today. The last tradition to note is New Year’s Eve. Here, haggis deserves a mention. Offal sausages were prized by the Vikings and the Romans – even a mate of Socrates raved about a tasty feast of offal-stuffed bladder. Made of lamb innards, onions, oatmeal and spice, it isn’t exactly plant-based. But it’s bang on trend for nose-to-tail eating. Throw tradition to the wind and fry yours in butter before dousing it with whisky. Add neeps, tatties and some bagrock, and you’re set for the year ahead.

12/25/2021,"Going into Boxing Day in fourth is more than we could have hoped after our worst start ever. The recovery has definitely been helped by the inconsistency of others but, in the chaos of the pandemic, most of us are just grateful to be able to witness some genuinely scintillating football. There’s enough appetite, intensity and resolve on show to inspire even the most fickle among the Arsenal faithful. 7/10  Stars/flops Tomiyasu, Tavares, White and Lokonga have settled well, and Aaron Ramsdale’s exuberant personality has made him an instant favourite. But above all it’s the chemistry between Martinelli, Saka and Smith Rowe which has us full of optimism. As for negatives: Pépé is increasingly looking like a £72m write-off, and it’s sad to see Auba’s time here come to such an ignominious end. Happy with the manager? He’s treading that gossamer fine line, only ever a couple of poor performances away from losing credibility. His uncompromising nature can be a positive but, with Auba joining the ranks of Torreira, Guendouzi and Saliba, it’s worrying that there’s no way back for players who fall foul of him, especially when resources aren’t as big as those of some rivals. 7/10 We will finish … Top six. Anything else would be a huge let-down. Funniest moment in 2021? Hearing the year’s best song – “Tottenham getting battered everywhere they go” – really catch on.  Bernard Azulay goonersdiary.co.uk @GoonerN5 Given we’ve lost the best player in a generation and the best manager in 10 years, it’s surprising to be calling this a 7/10 start. Gerrard has just begun so well. We’re a work in progress – tactically we have to evolve and new blood is needed – but, with some players standing two inches taller under the new regime, there’s plenty of room for optimism. This was always a crucial season: keeping Konsa and Watkins is only likely if we carry on making progress – but I’m mildly confident that this first Gerrard month hasn’t just been a honeymoon. Stars/flops Konsa is a rock and Cash is our best full-back since Mark Delaney. I’m gutted for Marvelous Nakamba, who was outstanding before getting crocked. Jacob Ramsey is on the sharpest upwards curve of all, though, a thrusting midfielder who could be really special. The new arrivals have all taken a while to settle in but Buendía has turned the corner. Less sure about Bailey and Ings. Happy with the manager? It was sad Dean Smith was given such a short rope – he’ll never want for a pint in north Birmingham again. But Gerrard has wowed most Villa fans, both on and off the pitch. We’ve improved, won where we’d have lost earlier in the season, and he’s really impressed me with the way he shrugs off the tedious journalistic obsession with his Liverpool past. And when he talks, he seems to have watched the same game I’ve just watched, which can’t be said for all managers. 8/10 We will finish … 9th. Funniest moment in 2021? Not sidesplitting, maybe, but bang on for fan sentiment against the Super League: the “we want our cold nights in Stoke” banner made by Chelsea fans.  Jonathan Pritchard So far, I’m very pleased with how it’s gone, especially as we have no barometer to measure against. Exciting wins against Arsenal and West Ham and nail-biters against Liverpool and Chelsea have set the entertainment bar very high. Injuries have floored us but we’re still chiselling points out. If you told me a year ago that Brentford would be 12th going into our first Christmas in the Premier League with games in hand, I would have laughed in your face. 8/10 Stars/flops Ivan Toney is a machine. He puts in a shift every match all over the pitch. Nørgaard has been class and Janelt is incredible – he never gives up. Also a shout to Rico Henry, who has taken his game to another level recently. It’s been harder for sixth-in-line centre-back Charlie Goode and back-up keeper Fernández, who were parachuted in due to injuries. Both have had tricky starts to their Premier League careers, but are learning fast. Happy with the manager? He’s done a fantastic job with a paper-thin squad and the league’s smallest budget. He’s comfortable going toe-to-toe with top coaches, switching it up if needed and isn’t afraid to take a risk. And he gets Brentford. Love him. 9/10. We will finish … If we get our injured players back by March, I’d like to think we’ll finish the season as brightly as we started. Glass half full says 14th. Funniest moment in 2021? I could be churlish and say Fulham being relegated a year after mocking us for losing in the play-off final. But I won’t. I still chuckle at the time we recorded a podcast at the Globe pub with our directors of football, Rasmus Ankersen and Phil Giles, in front of a live audience then surprised them as we put them on the spot about a future signing they thought was under wraps – Frank Onyeka. The pub roared with laughter as Rasmus was completely tongue-tied trying to talk his way out of that one.  Billy Grant Beesotted podcast and blog; @Beesotted; @BillyTheBee99 We started so well – the talk even turned to Europa League qualification. But then we stopped scoring. If we don’t beat Brentford we’ll have gone 100 days without a victory: an unbelievable run given that we’re still playing incredibly entertaining football and fell out of the top half only this month. We just need one win to get ourselves back on track. 7/10 Stars/flops Leandro Trossard has been our standout player; he scored the winner at Brentford in September and hopefully he can do it again as we host them. It’s been wonderful to see Shane Duffy thriving on his return from Celtic, Joel Veltman works hard every week and big-hearted Solly March creates chances. But it’s hard to be super scary and fired up without the injured Lewis Dunk. And Aaron Connolly should be moved on: it really isn’t happening for him. Happy with the manager? We’re privileged to have him. He’s instilled class and fight - and he comes across as a really decent guy in interviews. He’s smart, has the all-round welfare of the players at heart and stood his ground admirably after a few ridiculous boos following the draw with Leeds. It was heartening to see the applause he got at West Ham. 8/10 We will finish … 9th. Funniest moment in 2021? Maupay’s stunning 89th-minute equaliser on 1 December against West Ham. Fan site We Are Brighton noted: “Nothing in this world is certain except death, taxes and West Ham not beating Brighton.” And on a personal level, realising I was about to get my first tattoo from a Palace fan. Eek.  Steph Fincham It’s hard to be pleased with how it’s going. We’ve won just once and the bottom three at Christmas is never a good place to be. The results have been a continuation of the second half of last season, which brought us only 17 points. Performances have been better than the results – but it’s results that will determine whether we stay in the division. It’s not great off the field, either: there’s a lack of communication with the supporters’ organisations since the takeover. We need big improvements. 4/10 Stars/flops Undoubtedly the big star has been Maxwel Cornet, signed from Lyon in August: an exciting talent. Nathan Collins, another summer arrival, has really impressed and looks a real prospect in defence. Charlie Taylor has also been outstanding in so many games this season. A few have struggled, though: Chris Wood hasn’t looked the same player this season – representing New Zealand at the Olympics probably didn’t help. He’s still scored three goals, though: we need a return from the other strikers. Happy with the manager? He’s having a tough spell but he’s done a great job over nine years here. He just needs backing during this difficult time. 7/10 We will finish … Hopefully, 17th or higher. But I doubt it’ll be much higher. Funniest moment in 2021? It’s hard to laugh when you’ve lost but Newcastle’s reaction to beating us – a lap of honour and dressing-room celebratory photos – really was funny.  Tony Scholes UpTheClarets.com, @utcdotcom It’s been a solid first half of the season. Recent form has been a disappointment – defeat at West Ham at the start of December, plus draws with Everton and Wolves – but overall we have to be happy to be in the top four at this stage. Until the recent stumble we were probably exceeding expectations, leading the table for a good couple of months above two excellent teams in City and Liverpool. 8/10 Stars/flops Reece James, Thiago Silva, Ben Chilwell and a resurgent Mason Mount are the pick so far: Mount has added some much-needed goals to his impressive work rate and, once again, Silva is just oozing class at the back. As for flops: Saúl, on loan from Atlético Madrid, has really found the Premier League a tough gig; Lukaku started well but has failed to impress lately; and Pulisic continues to struggle with form, fitness and limited minutes. Happy with the manager?Tuchel appears as frustrated as the rest of us with the way things have been going recently but he knows what he’s doing. If he can crack getting past the parked buses and get our forwards firing we’ll have a successful second half of the season. 8/10 We will finish … 3rd. Funniest moment in 2021? Rüdiger charging down the pitch like Usain Bolt to join in the post-match melee with the Leeds players this month was hilarious. He loves a tear-up.  Paul Baker in memory of Trizia Fiorellino With so many players off in the summer, and the search for a manager taking so long, plenty were tipping us to finish bottom this season. So in short, it’s gone far better than anyone expected. The style of football has been an utter transformation: dominating possession, playing out from the back – unimaginable in the grind of the last campaign. To a man all of the new signings have settled in wonderfully and this young, attacking team has filled even the most hardened Palace fans’ hearts with joy. 8/10 Stars/flops Conor Gallagher has been a revelation: goals, assists, boundless energy, all with a beaming smile on his face. Marc Guéhi’s partnership with Joachim Andersen can be a foundation stone at the back for years to come, Michael Olise has been very effective off the bench, and Odsonne Édouard looks very promising up front. And James McArthur has belied his years – we’ve badly missed him since his injury. Luka Milivojevic and Cheikhou Kouyaté haven’t always looked settled, though, and Christian Benteke and Jordan Ayew still miss too many chances – though you can’t fault their work rate. Happy with the manager? Everyone knows Vieira wasn’t first, second or even third choice but he has settled in brilliantly. He commands incredible respect from the players, and he gets what the club stands for. He is very clear in his football philosophy, which has the total backing of his fans. If he can just get the team to manage leads late in the game better, then we will have the complete package. 9/10 We will finish … 11th. Funniest moment in 2021? Winning 2-1 at Brighton with the last kick, having had just two touches in their box for the entire match. Wonderful.  Chris Waters @Clapham_Grand A decent start, then a terrible run in the last 10 games: one win, two draws, seven defeats. We’ve a terrible injury list with questions over the club’s rehab programmes – but that doesn’t disguise Rafa Benítez’s poor selection, tactics and game management, or the less than stellar performances from experienced players. So it’s 3/10 – and it would have been 2/10 save for the performances against Arsenal at home and Chelsea away. Stars/flops Pickford has been in superb shot-stopping form. Anthony Gordon is growing into his role, while Gray is the signing of the season: pace and goals, all for £1.7m. Flops? Rondón, unsurprisingly not fit and too slow; sadly Iwobi, technically superbly talented in training but not in matches; and Digne, disappointing and seemingly out of the door in January. Happy with the manager? Always a contentious hire, he made a good start and communicated well. But the downturn revived all the concerns about him; dour, cautious football, no cohesion, an inability to get the best out of players and so on … 2/10 We will finish … DCL’s return will be a lift but it’s still a threadbare squad. No better than 12th, no worse than 16th. Funniest moment in 2021? If any young pro wants lessons on how to engage and endear yourself to fans, look at Richarlison. Not his greatest season on the pitch but fabulous off it. A recent video of him managing a team on a local park was hilarious.  The Esk TheEsk.org; @TheEsk It’s a cruel twist of football that, if last season hadn’t been so good, this one wouldn’t be rating so low. Maybe we got carried away but, far from building on ninth, Leeds have been dragged into a relegation scrap we thought we’d dodged. We’re still on target for the big-picture aim of establishing the club in the Premier League over two seasons but it’s not nearly as much fun. 1/10 Stars/flops Illan Meslier, the young keeper with Serge Gainsbourg’s voice, veers heroically between winning points and keeping scores down. Up front, Joffy Gelhardt is worth his hype. A shout, too, for Adam Forshaw, 771 days out injured, never playing better. The rest? Staying fit would be a start. Happy with the manager? Marcelo Bielsa is getting full support in spite of everything that’s happened lately, and it’s fun how it really annoys people who don’t understand Leeds United Football Club. 10/10 We will finish … 15th. Just like being back in the Championship. Funniest moment in 2021? For a few weeks Bielsa was spotted wearing wonky glasses. Eventually Pat Bamford confessed to belting him in the face with a shot in training, and the boss was too busy to get them fixed. It’s a sort of charming chaos at Leeds sometimes.  Daniel Chapman thesquareball.net; @MoscowhiteTSB Am I pleased with how it’s gone? In a word, no. Leicester have been well short of their best – arguably turning in only two good 90-minute performances all season. The dominant wins over Manchester United and Newcastle showed our finest form isn’t unreachable but ultimately our performances this season have more often resembled our yellow-bellied humbling by Chelsea. Thankfully, though, the results have been better than our displays. 5/10 Stars/flops It’s pleasing to see Vardy and Patson Daka scoring so regularly, and to see Maddison finally rediscovering his form. Youri Tielemans continues to show flashes of genius – fans voted him our player of 2021. Less positively, signing half the backline of the team you beat 9-0 in Vestergaard and Bertrand has gone down exactly as you’d expect … Happy with the manager? To borrow an over-used cliche, Rodgers has credit in the bank but he has a lot of work to do to iron out Leicester’s defensive chaos and general malaise. Most fans are willing to give him a chance to rediscover our best football – but they won’t wait forever. 5/10 We will finish … With injuries and our defensive record, anything above 10th would be a minor miracle. Funniest moment in 2021? It’s hard to look past Kelechi Iheanacho wearing the FA Cup as a crown and offering to sell it to two Wembley stewards.  Chris Whiting clippings.me/chriswhiting; @ChrisRWhiting  Part two: Liverpool to Wolves",Sport/Football,"Premier League fans’ half-term reports, part one: Arsenal to Leicester",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/25/premier-league-fans-half-term-reports-part-one-arsenal-to-leicester
12/25/2021,"We are becoming accustomed to hearing moments in women’s sport – on and off various fields, pitches, courts, pools and tracks – be described as gamechanging. It could be seen as an overused phrase or an exaggeration given how frequently it is rolled out. Except women’s sport is benefiting from a broader movement and advocacy for women in society generally – against sexism and abuses, for reproductive rights and equal pay – and the broad increase in consciousness around these issues. What is no longer acceptable in wider society is also not acceptable in women’s sport and athletes, coaches and the women’s sports community are picking up the pitchforks to demand better in increasing participation and, critically, there is momentum behind the drive for change.  The reality, then, is that referring to a moment or event in women’s sport as a game-changer or gamechanging is not an exaggeration because we are living in a golden age in the development in women’s sport, and 2022 promises to be no different. Women’s football has the potential to take a huge leap forward next year, especially in England. The home European Championship in England, postponed from summer 2021 to 2022 because of the pandemic, is central to this. England has hosted a women’s Euros before, in 2005, yet the impact was minimal. So, what makes this tournament different? In part, it relates to the time we are living in, when women’s football is being championed domestically and internationally as never before. The 2005 tournament did not benefit from the same level of media coverage and financial backing as women’s football does today. For the 13th edition of the competition, everything including the kitchen sink is being thrown at it to make sure it leaves a deep legacy. How successfully or effectively that is being done remains to be seen and many variables will affect how impactful the tournament is. A strong performance from England is key, but preparations have not been easy. Because the host nation qualifies automatically the Lionesses missed out on a number of competitive fixtures and struggled to arrange high-quality friendlies owing to Covid restrictions. The gap between the close of the 2019 World Cup and the start of the qualifying campaign for the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in September 2021 was large. This tumultuous time also resulted in Phil Neville leaving earlier than planned, forcing the Football Association to turn temporarily to Hege Riise as interim England head coach and manager of Team GB for the Olympics, before the arrival of Neville’s planned successor, Sarina Wiegman. Under Wiegman England have breezed through World Cup qualifying to date, and the newly launched Arnold Clark Cup in February promises to offer their first real warm-up test. Spain, who boast a number of Barcelona’s Champions League stars, Germany, the Euros’ most successful team, and the Olympic champions Canada will travel to England to play a round-robin format consisting of three double-headers across seven days and will put England’s credentials as European title contenders under extreme pressure. This mouthwatering mini-tournament is sandwiched by the second half of a most-watched domestic season that has twists and turns left to go. With Arsenal four points clear of Chelsea at the top of the Women’s Super League, unbeaten but having dropped two points in a draw with Brighton, this has been the first time in a number of years where there has not been an air of infallibility around a single team. The first season with the Sky Sports and BBC Sport broadcast deal offers a level of exposure in the buildup to a women’s international tournament unlike anything seen before. For the reigning European champions, the Netherlands, the boost from hosting the 2017 Euros was huge. The country was awash with orange as Dutch fans flocked to support the team’s phenomenal run to the final under Wiegman, who left to join England this summer. Still, the national team have tens of thousands show up to watch friendlies. Yet the profile of women’s football in the Netherlands and the development of the country’s domestic leagues before that tournament are dwarfed by the state of the game in England. The Lionesses will be talked up as a contenders, but the competition in European women’s football has never been fiercer. Seven of the eight teams in the last World Cup quarter-finals were from Europe, with only the eventual champions, the United States, bucking the trend. Regardless of whether England triumph in July, there is a real opportunity to embed women’s football into society. Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and England could, to varying degrees, legitimately be aiming for the trophy because the competitive level is better than ever, denting England’s hopes of emulating the Netherlands’ success. No fewer than 700,000 tickets are available across the month-long tournament. In the Netherlands 240,000 attended games. The FA has sold 162,000 tickets in pre-sales and had 268,000 tickets requested through a first ballot window in October. Come the close of the Euros the new domestic season will be on the horizon and positioned to capitalise on any increased interest. Few, if any, countries have managed to translate the thirst for international women’s football into an appetite for the domestic game. Could 2022 be the year that changes? Maybe.",Sport/Sport,Euro 2022 can kickstart a great leap forward for women’s football | Suzanne Wrack,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/25/euro-2022-can-kickstart-a-great-leap-forward-for-womens-football
12/25/2021,"However incompatible they superficially appear, the link between English cricket and Christmas has blossomed since the moment their first travelling team docked in Melbourne on 24 December 1861. But the visitors’ yuletide experience has changed considerably from the days when WG Grace visited in 1873 and spent Christmas Day hunting, unsuccessfully, for kangaroo before enjoying “a good, long, late night”. Or the apparently less enjoyable trip 24 years later when Ted Wainwright, the Yorkshire all-rounder, mournfully informed his teammates over lunch: “I wish I was back in the little cottage turning the meat.” On the Bodyline tour of 1932-33, Douglas Jardine spent the big day fishing in Tasmania, a turn of events the local tourist board considered so exciting they issued a commemorative postcard. In 1936 the tourists, already away from home for more than three months, celebrated with particular gusto – although “some confessed they would rather be among the snow and sleet of England” than at the team’s Christmas dinner in a private room at Usher’s hotel in Sydney, where “all formality was dropped, and there was much good-natured banter and singing” – being as they were 2-0 up in a five-Test series. They lost the next three.  The Boxing Day Test has become, in the words of Mark Butcher, “a major part of cricketing folklore”, but it was a surprisingly recent addition to the calendar. England and Australia first met on that date in 1950, when the second Test resumed on 26 December after two days off. The following year, West Indies played Test cricket on Christmas Day itself, which one tourist declared “sacrilegious” and was not much more popular with the home side. “I have never played on Christmas Day before in my life and don’t like having to do so now,” an unnamed Australian said. The first Test to start on Boxing Day followed 18 years later, and the first time England had a go was 1974. Since 1980 only four Australian summers have been without one – 1984, 1988 and 1994 – when Tests started before Christmas and resumed afterwards, and the fallow year of 1989, when Australia played an ODI against Sri Lanka instead. Between 1980 and 1985 there were four draws in six years and in this period the MCG was heavily criticised for everything from the quality of pitches to their toilet facilities. Thankfully, as the Guardian reported in 1981, “the Melbourne public are said to be willing to watch anything”, and in 1982 the nascent tradition was boosted by “one of the most consistently thrilling Tests of all time”. It was the first to feature four innings that all ended within 10 runs of each other, was on a knife-edge from the start and never left, and remains the joint third closest in history. It ended with Australia needing 292 to win but after Norman Cowans, playing his third Test and having taken a total of one wicket in his first two, had snaffled his sixth of the second innings to dismiss Rodney Hogg they were 74 away as their last batter, Jeff Thomson, came out to join Allan Border. “The rest of the blokes in our dressing room thought I would have a slog and get out. But it didn’t happen that way,” Thomson said. “I can still picture the England side’s growing anxiety. They had stupid fields, bowled badly and everything was in the batsmen’s favour.” After a couple of rain delays they were still 37 away at the end of day four, and 18,000 people turned up to see them edge towards their target the following morning. Australia were just four away when Ian Botham bowled to Thomson. “It was a half-tracker and a bit of an away swinger. A bad ball, really,” Thomson said. “I just tried to push it for a single rather than smash it. All I did was get an edge.” The ball flew straight to Chris Tavaré at second slip, who caught it with his left hand but couldn’t hold it; Geoff Miller at first slip grabbed it before it fell to earth. “I couldn’t talk about it for years,” said Thomson. “It was one of the all-time low moments in my life.” In the crowd, attending his first Test, a 13-year-old Shane Warne sat transfixed; he went on to play 10 Boxing Day Tests, took a hat-trick as England were beaten in 1994, and now has a statue outside the ground. Of the 10 MCG Boxing Day Tests England have won four, lost four and drawn two, making it a particularly fertile fixture. The other Ashes classic came in 1998. An Australia side already 2-0 up in the series and apparently coasting to victory, set just 175 to win and at one point 103 for two, were derailed by “their own complacency and an astounding effort from the England pace attack”, in the words of the Guardian’s Mike Selvey. It ended with a mammoth four-hour session which ended after Mark Taylor decided, with seven wickets down and just 13 needed, to claim a discretionary half-hour to complete Australia’s victory. England promptly took three in five balls to win by 12. Where once visiting English cricketers were hunters, this year’s tourists seem to have spent most of their trip being hunted. However their Christmas ends, though, it will have looked very different to the one the players experienced in 1903, when before going to the theatre on Christmas Eve they were taken on a tour of Sydney’s opium and gambling dens. “Interesting to see,” Sussex’s Bert Relf wrote. “Would not go again.”",Sport/Sport,Great escapes and all-time thrillers: the history of Boxing Day Ashes Tests,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/25/great-escapes-and-all-time-thrillers-the-history-of-boxing-day-ashes-tests
12/25/2021,"Remarkably, the website is still live. Eight months after the European Super League disintegrated in an embarrassing fireball, you might think its founders would be minded to erase all trace of their hubris and humiliation. But perhaps that would be to credit them with too much competence. And so there it remains to this day: “The Super League is a new European competition between 20 top clubs comprised of 15 founders and five annual qualifiers.” Well, good luck with that. There is, of course, an alternative theory. After all, the Super League is still not quite dead in a legislative sense; certainly not if you believe the loud and persistent avowals of Andrea Agnelli at Juventus, Joan Laporta at Barcelona and Florentino Pérez at Real Madrid, the three remaining hoarse men of the apocalypse. Meanwhile the impulses that generated the Super League – greed, inequality, shifting financial models, Covid – have not disappeared. Perhaps on reflection, that the Super League website is still up is not an oversight, but a warning.  The junking of the Super League may have been a rare moment of harmony in a toxically clannish game – and really, it takes some effort to unite the commentariat, the players, the coaches, the broadcasters, the vast majority of the clubs and the vast majority of fans in revulsion at your product. But in the days and weeks afterwards fans talked openly of a new compact in football, a renegotiated and more equitable power settlement that placed supporters and communities at its heart. As we near the end of one of the most tumultuous and rancourous years in the history of football, how’s that going? In order to answer that question let’s start at Oldham, who banned three of their own fans from Boundary Park for “promoting dislike” against the club’s owner, Abdallah Lemsagam, before reversing their decision amid a widespread backlash. In his three years in charge, Lemsagam has overseen nine managerial changes and a drop to 23rd in League Two. Explaining his original decision (taken from his home in Dubai), Lemsagam offered this reasoning: “If they are not behaving like every person just watching the game, they deserve to be banned. If you want to protest, nobody can stop you. But why can’t I also ban you?” In a way, this is the basic ideological faultline of modern football: what is a club and who does it belong to? The romantic will tell you a club is the sum total of its people and its history, that players and coaches pass through but fans remain true, that owners are no more than custodians preserving the institution for the next generation. The three briefly banned fans may feel that Oldham are more their club than Lemsagam’s. But the Companies House filings will tell a very different story. This is why any attempt to frame the power imbalance in football as one of bigger clubs against smaller clubs, or even bigger leagues and smaller leagues, often obscures as much as it illuminates. Part of the ideological opposition to the Super League was based on the idea of football as a pyramid: a linked whole driving not just investment but aspiration and hope. But within this structure all sorts of complex smaller battles are being fought: between fans and owners, fans and other fans, players and governing bodies, clubs and agents, clubs and broadcasters, broadcasters and fans. The economist Paul Mason argues that football is not so much a pyramid as a “class struggle”: between fans and players on one side, and the massed ranks of owners, broadcasters, the financial sector and big tech on the other. If one side possesses most of the fervour, the talent and the human emotion, the other side owns pretty much everything else. To modern capitalism, football is essentially a product to be sold, generated, grown, disseminated. Anything that distracts from this fundamental goal – player welfare, fan sentiment, 3pm kick-offs – must by extension be suppressed. The Super League crystallised this vision perfectly. Too perfectly: in explicitly stating its intention to convert 65 years of European football history into a sort of fungible on-demand content stream, an enclosed circus, a Vegas residency, it horrified not just long-standing “legacy” fans but also advocates of the status quo. The snap-back has been modest but not inconsequential. Manchester United’s first ever fan advisory board will meet in January with Joel Glazer in attendance. Liverpool and Chelsea have announced similar plans. None of this would have happened without the Super League. So is this a defining moment? Have the owners of the biggest clubs undergone a Damascene conversion to democracy? Or was it merely an attempt to stave off the more far-reaching reforms proposed by the government’s fan-led review, which was unveiled last month with proposals for an independent regulator and a levy on Premier League transfer fees? The fierce backlash to the latter proposals from some owners – the Leeds chief executive, Angus Kinnear, derided them as “Maoist” – suggests any meaningful change in the game will have to be won over the stiffest resistance. And besides, what are the available vehicles for change? Fifa? National governments? Fan boycotts? Good luck with any of that. What is certainly true is that the appetite for change is there. Breaking with football’s traditional model of saturation and endless growth is no longer a niche opinion but a mainstream opinion. “Football must change quickly,” the Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, said in a recent interview. “The quality of the show has dropped a lot. The players cannot take it any more. Fatigue, injuries, games that end 10-0. Enough is enough.” This is not a conversation we were having 20 years or even five years ago. But of course, everyone agrees on the need for change. It is the direction that is contested. For people such as Pérez, Ancelotti’s boss, the answer to competitive imbalance is simply for Madrid to stop playing teams such as Elche and Leganés (“I do not think it’s more attractive to watch unfamiliar teams,” he said during the infamous El Chiringuito interview in April). The answer to player fatigue is to reduce games to 45 or 60 minutes with plenty of ad breaks for the broadcasters. The Super League itself may have been defeated but its ideas continue to triumph everywhere. In April, Uefa quietly pushed through its new 36-team Champions League format that provides an even bigger safety net to the biggest clubs. Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain may have been toppled in Italy and France, but elsewhere established giants firmly laid to rest any notion that Covid might offer a temporary levelling of the playing field. Sheriff Tiraspol made it six titles in a row in Moldova, Red Bull Salzburg eight in a row in Austria, Bayern Munich nine in a row in Germany, Ludogorets 10 in a row in Bulgaria. Across Europe, clubs are partnering with cryptocurrency companies with the sole intention of further milking their fanbases for cash. In England, virus-emaciated squads are being forced to play three games in a week because nobody is brave or foolish enough to slow down the gravy train. And yet even in these grim days of midwinter, it remains possible to glimpse something better. The Super League protests showed us that when fans and players and genuine football lovers speak with a single voice, not even the most powerful men in the game can thwart them. Eight months on, much of that initial energy may have diffused and dissipated, but the will to change football for the better has not subsided. In time, we may come back to look on 2021 as the year when football’s silent majority finally, tentatively, discovered its voice.",Sport/Football,2021 was the year when football’s silent majority finally found its voice | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/25/2021-review-premier-league-esl-fans-silent-majority
12/25/2021,"It’s going pretty much how most Liverpool fans expected: we’re up at the top and we cruised through the Champions League group stage to the knockouts. We’re playing some brilliant football and we’re a joy to watch. We’ve had our big names back from injury, which has boosted confidence, and, when we do go behind, the belief is there that we’ll score and score again, and usually go on to win. 9/10  Stars/flops Mo Salah is the obvious standout performer and remains on another level to anyone else in the league. It’s a thrill and privilege to watch him play every week. We’re finally seeing how brilliant Thiago is and new signing Konaté is already proving he’ll go on to be a major player. A word, too, for young Tyler Morton who has been eased into the team and really shown his potential. As for flops? I seem to have been saying this for some time but we really don’t have any. Happy with the manager? He has elevated us to Europe’s most revered and feared team. He makes us smile in our play and his actions. We could have no better boss. 10/10 We will finish … 1st. Funniest moment in 2021? During the games against Atlético Madrid, seeing Diego Simeone reduced from touchline hard case to panto villain. Oh, and Fred lunging at a laughing Konaté at Old Trafford, sending himself viral.  Steph Jones I don’t think it could have gone much better. We’re top of the tree at Christmas, three points clear of Liverpool, topped our Champions League group (ahead of PSG) and have managed our squad really well. The only real disappointment so far was getting knocked out of our beloved Carabao. 9.5/10 Stars/flops Plenty of stars. But the standout, without doubt, has been Bernardo Silva. He and Salah are comfortably the best players in the league this season. He’s always been a one-man pressing machine, a mesmeric dribbler, and capable of dictating the pace of a game on his own, but this season he’s added goals and assists. He can literally do everything. Cancelo and Rodri definitely deserve mentions too. Both have taken their games to another level. Happy with the manager? Of course. Pep has proven yet again that he’s the best in the business. Klopp is a close second and Liverpool’s resurgence is mightily impressive, but Pep’s consistency and relentlessness is unrivalled. I thought the lack of a striker would hamper us – Pep really wanted a No 9 and I thought he’d struggle to keep the striker-less system fresh – but he’s done it. He has us perfectly positioned going into 2022. 10/10. We will finish … 1st. Funniest moment in 2021? Ole being at the wheel. I think I speak on behalf of all City fans when I say I’m gutted that era is over. It was a great laugh. Oh, and people seriously tipping United for the title in August.  Lloyd Scragg ninetythreetwenty.com; @lloyd_scragg It’s been awful. Many of us expected to be legitimate title challengers after finishing second last season and adding Varane, Sancho and Ronaldo. Going top after Ronaldo’s second debut against Newcastle added to that sense. So what followed beggared belief. The 5-0 defeat to Liverpool was the worst, most humiliating loss in living memory. It was clear for a while that the players had stopped playing for the manager: Ole should have walked then rather than wait for further defeats to City and, embarrassingly, Watford. 2/10 Stars/flops We’ve become over-reliant on Ronaldo but Greenwood and a rejuvenated De Gea have been the best out of a poor bunch. Varane’s injury was a blow: he steadied a flapping defence bereft of any confidence. Flops? Bruno has been way below his usual standard but his mediocre performances are nothing compared with the pathetic fare served up by Wan Bissaka and captain Maguire. Both consistently woeful. Happy with the manager? It’s too early to rate him but he talks a good game. I admired his comments about players not wanting to be at the club, and him saying: “I don’t communicate with agents via the media and press.” I hope he clears the decks of the wage thieves and will address the lack of quality in the midfield. We will finish … 4th. Funniest moment in 2021? The reaction of rivals when we re-signed Ronaldo on that Friday afternoon in August. It really lifted our spirits in what seems otherwise like a really drab 12 months of football.  Shaun O’Donnell One win in 18, calamitous defending, rotten luck and some troubling refereeing … it’s been a nightmare, even by our standards. But Ashley’s departure and Eddie Howe’s appointment lifted the mood. Home matches no longer reek of toxicity and, at times, the atmosphere has been electric. Yes, the short-term prognosis is dire and it’ll take a long time to emerge from Ashley’s shadow, but the future looks brighter than it has in years – whether we are relegated or not. There is hope. 2/10 Stars/flops Callum Wilson is a true Newcastle No 9: vital to the cause. But our error-prone defenders – especially Jamaal Lascelles and Ciaran Clark – are threatening our Premier League status and, sadly, Joe Willock hasn’t lived up to his promise. In truth, after years of neglect, we’re lacking in real quality all over the pitch. There are too many Championship level players in the current squad. Happy with the manager? Howe “gets” Newcastle and has the respect of our fans. The team look fitter and more positive going forward … and he seems to have turned the much-maligned Joelinton into a world beater… At 4-0 down against Man City, we were singing “Eddie Howe’s black and white army”, which says it all. 7/10. As for Steve Bruce, we’re surprised he didn’t get the Manchester United job, given the esteem the football intelligentsia seem to hold him in… 2/10 We will finish … 17th. That’s with huge investment in January, and a miraculous turnaround. Funniest moment in 2021? Local lad Sam Fender’s hungover appearance on BBC Breakfast the morning after the takeover was completed. Fair play, he did well to get through it.  David and Richard Holmes We’re bottom, we’ve been there for most of the season, we’ve scored eight goals and have been ridiculed by everyone from the MotD crew to that bloke on Twitter who reckons we should declare and hand back our Premier League cash. It’s been grim, basically. As is invariably the case when we breathe in this refined air, we’ve struggled to compete. It seems our “self-funding” model, however worthy, is incompatible with being competitive at this level. 3/10 Stars/flops Mathias Normann – a summer loan signing from Rostov – has been the pick of the bunch but in typical Norwich fashion managed to pick up a pelvic injury just when he’d really started to make a difference. Ditto Milot Rashica who, after a slow start, found a rich vein of form before, you guessed it, picking up an injury that ruled him out for all of December. Happy with the manager? Dean Smith has an unenviable task but, armed with a squad that is simply not good enough, has made a decent enough start. 6/10. Daniel Farke was brilliant at getting us promoted but unable to work his magic in the Premier League. We will finish … 20th. Funniest moment in 2021? Laughs have been limited in Norfolk, so my thanks to Leeds fans who, while watching their team getting pumped by Arsenal, found it in their hearts to speak for the nation with a song about Boris Johnson. Not repeatable but it was both amusing and spot-on.  Gary Gowers myfootballwriter.com; @Gary_Gowers; @MFW_NCFC Performances have largely been fine but instinctively it feels that results haven’t quite matched them – despite taking seven more points compared with the corresponding games last season. That’s probably a result of the ever-growing but ever-tedious “points dropped from winning positions” statistic. If we could hold on to a lead we’d be comfortably in the top half and very happy with life. 6/10 Stars/flops Mohammed Salisu and Tino Livramento have stood out in a defence that has often struggled as a collective. Armando Broja has scored some important goals at the other end in a relatively unproductive attack, while Che Adams’ displays have been better than his goal return would suggest. On the flipside, Jan Bednarek has regressed and captain James Ward-Prowse – following a bumper new contract in September – hasn’t been up to his usual high standards. Happy with the manager? Reasonably. He still makes some baffling selections and can still be too slow to react to opposition changes, but we are pretty well-drilled. He’s also now the longest-serving Saints manager since Chris Nichol in the 80s, which says quite a lot – not much of it positive – about the club over the last 30 years or so. 6.5/10 We will finish … 12th. Funniest moment in 2021? I was a big fan of the whole England setup winding up the Conservative party during the Euros, and the government flailing desperately to row back on the criticism as we progressed further in the tournament. Funny in many aspects but also a sad indictment on modern life and governance, I guess.  Steve Grant SaintsWeb.co.uk; @SteveGrant1983 The Tottenham rollercoaster. You have no choice but to get on it and no way of getting off it. From Kane in Disneyland to the misguided appointment of “nice guy” Nuno to then finally getting our man. No, not Mauricio; Antonio. Conte is the jolt Spurs have been desperate for. With games in hand we’re in contention for the top four – even in crisis, we still find a way to potentially gatecrash. Conte will fix us but it will take time. 8/10 for Spursyness, 6/10 for the mess we’ve allowed Antonio to inherit. Stars/flops Eric Dier, Ben Davies and Oliver Skipp have excelled: proof that Conte can reboot players. Tanguy Ndombele continues to be benched, not because he lacks talent, but because, like Dele Alli, he doesn’t quite fit. Unless they too are rebooted. Future acquisitions need to blend into the blueprint. Happy with the manager? Nuno was a cursed placeholder. 4/10 is the most diplomatic score I can offer him. Conte? We are blessed. His obsessive mentality is what we need: a culture-defining appointment. 9/10 for simply getting him in our colours. We will finish … 4th, because I wear my heart on my sleeve. I’m a romantic fool. Covid, postponements and the impact on training make it improbable that we’ll find the momentum, but … well, this is THFC. We often do the opposite of what everyone expects. Funniest moment in 2021? Getting beaten by Zagreb, whose manager was in prison, was a glorious moment of dark comedy. A very special moment indeed, would you agree, José?  Spooky dearmrlevy.com; thefightingcock.co.uk; @spooky23 Some things haven’t gone well, some things haven’t worked and perspective is always shaped by the most recent events … So, overall “could have been a lot better, could have been worse” sums it up. 5/10 Stars/flops Emmanuel Dennis has grown from being an occasionally effective irritant to consistently top class. Also Moussa Sissoko, more captainy with every game, is dominant in a reworked midfield. Less successful have been Danny Rose, who has been very decent sometimes but less than decent too often, and William Troost-Ekong, who has suffered a crisis of confidence in our volatile defence. Happy with the manager? Results haven’t really improved but that disguises the stark contrast between the relatively gentle opening to the season and a daunting run more recently, at just the point when a rejuvenated side under Ranieri might have picked up some momentum. We recorded our first win at Everton, thrashed United, scared Chelsea and limited a rampant Man City to 3-1. We now have a presentable, credible side with a couple of things that aren’t quite working. Progress. 7/10 We will finish … 14th. Funniest moment in 2021? Bournemouth’s collapse was enjoyed and celebrated far and wide. And Tyrone Mings’ own goal on the opening day – via a perversely unlucky deflection – also had a touch of karma about it. Two years ago he somehow escaped a red card against us at Villa Park before unwittingly scoring a last-minute winner when Ezri Konsa’s shot deflected in off his backside.  Matt Rowson bhappy.wordpress.com; @mattrowson There’s been a slight slump recently but we’ve progressed with surprising ease in the Europa League and been challenging for the top four. With fans back, the London Stadium has finally started to feel more like home and West Ham have at times been massive (everywhere we go), beating Spurs, Man United, Man City, Liverpool and Chelsea, which is unprecedented. The only downside is that the squad is now looking stretched. 8/10 Stars/flops Declan Rice has looked the league’s best defensive midfielder, gliding through matches and adding a great turn of pace. He’s also had a social media hit with Rice Baby. Credit also to Jarrod Bowen, who’s on fire and, erm, dating Dani Dyer, Antonio, Fornals, Benrahma, Johnson and the unsung Craig Dawson. Relative flops have been Soucek, who looks very tired, and new signings Vlasic and Kral, though it’s early days. Happy with the manager? He has transformed the club, taking us from relegation fodder to contenders for a Champions League place. We very rarely have two good seasons in a row, but so far Moyes has bucked that trend. Should he get us to a cup final the party could rival one of Boris’s. But as he says, having set high standards, the players have to keep them up. The only gripe is Moyes’ failure to secure a back-up striker in the summer. 8/10 We will finish … 7th. The pressure on our small squad is likely to tell with Zouma and Ogbonna out, and having Antonio as our only striker. Funniest moment in 2021? Arthur Masuaku proving that he really is better than Lukaku with that late winner against Chelsea. Don’t be fooled by Arthur’s false modesty – he definitely saw Mendy off his line and scored with a sublime Messi-like chip.  Pete May Author, Goodbye to Boleyn; hammersintheheart.blogspot.co.uk Rice Rice Baby🎶😂 #singyourdialect Better than expected. I was worried about Nuno being replaced by a new coach with little reputation, and by only minor surgery to a squad that limped home last season. But Lage has proved an astute tactician, the new players have done well and we’ve been a highly competitive outfit. Not too shabby at all. 8/10 Stars/flops Max Kilman has graduated from squad filler to first-team regular and looks like a top Premier League defender. Behind him José Sá had big boots to fill replacing Rui Patrício but has been an upgrade in almost every respect. It’s harsh to call them flops but Traoré, Trincão and Podence haven’t managed a single league goal between them and our attacking output has been poor. Happy with the manager? 9/10. You just have to look at the group of players he’s working with and the level of competition. He’s done about as well as anyone could expect. He wants to be progressive in possession but is also wise enough to know he has to play to the team’s strengths. We will finish … 9th. I’ve seen enough to believe we can hold our own in the mid-table scrap but Europe will probably be out of reach unless we make some decent additions in January. Historically, we don’t do much so I’m not holding my breath. Funniest moment in 2021? Raúl’s viral failed Rabona gave me a chuckle. His comeback has been one of football’s feelgood stories this year and he’s looked like he’s really enjoying his football – maybe a bit too much on that occasion…  Thomas Baugh wolvesblog.com; @wolvesblog  Part one: Arsenal to Leicester",Sport/Football,"Premier League fans’ half-term reports, part two: Liverpool to Wolves",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/25/premier-league-fans-half-term-reports-part-two-liverpool-to-wolves
12/25/2021,"As Simone Biles entered the Ariake Gymnastics Centre for the women’s team final at the Tokyo Olympics, the eyes of the sporting world slowly fixated on her. She was, to many, the most dominant athlete in the world and the greatest gymnast in history, undefeated in the all-around, team and floor competitions since 2013. She had pushed the boundaries of the sport even further throughout the summer and after winning four gold medals and a bronze in Rio, it was the start of what could have been the final, crowning moment of her career. Instead, what unfolded that evening was astonishing. On her first event in the team final, the vault, Biles completely lost track of herself in the air as she attempted her 2.5 twisting Yurchenko vault, one of her most trusted skills. After aborting the skill and somehow avoiding injury, Biles disappeared from the competition floor with her national team staff. When Biles eventually returned, she huddled with her teammates, and then she was done.  After the competition, Biles could have avoided speaking in depth or even walked straight past the journalists in the mixed zone. Instead, numerous reporters departed in awe of what they had heard after she openly explained her mental health struggles. Asked exactly why she decided not to compete, her response was clear: “To focus on my wellbeing,” she said. “There is more to life than just gymnastics.” Later that evening, during the official press conference, her teammates rallied around her and offered their unending support. Biles had followed in the footsteps of Naomi Osaka, whom she referenced, by placing discussions about mental health in the centre of sports. As with Osaka, another prominent black woman, it immediately led to predictable backlash and scorn across social media. But Biles remained resolute and in the following days her issues became clearer. She had developed the twisties, which occurs when a gymnast’s mind and body are out of sync, rendering them unable to complete certain skills safely. Biles had completely lost her air-awareness during her twisting skills so continuing to compete meant there was an extremely high chance of her falling and injuring herself, possibly seriously. Each day brought news of Biles withdrawing from another event, but she would still travel to the arena for each final and cheer louder ithan anyone else for her compatriots and rivals from other countries alike. Behind the scenes, Biles was secretly doing everything in her power to return. She located a private gym outside of the Olympic Village and each day she would safely attempt her skills into its foam pits. At no point in Tokyo did she regain her twisting ability, but Biles decided to remove all of the twists from her balance beam routine and attempt to compete on the very final day of competition. After days of hearing her mental strength questioned, Biles returned to competition and threw down an extremely clean routine to earn a bronze medal despite the diminished difficulty level. Over the past few years, so much has happened to Biles that led to the events in Tokyo. She has competed at the highest level since 2013, an eternity in women’s gymnastics. Even though she has avoided any lengthy injury layoffs, which are common in gymnastics, so many years of pounding her muscles and joints in training has left a painful mark on her body. After nearing what finally seemed an appropriate finish line for her career, she was distraught when the pandemic pushed the Olympics back by a year. Meanwhile, Biles continued to compete and cement her greatness while coming to terms with being a very public survivor of sexual abuse by the former US team doctor Larry Nassar, who also abused many of her former teammates. She wrestled with the reality that she could only continue to chase her personal goals in her sport by representing USA Gymnastics, the organisation that had failed to protect her. That she was the last remaining survivor on the team only increased the pressure she felt to continue to compete and hold the governing body to account. As Biles collected her medal on 3 August and digested her thoughts, she was not yet prepared to fully embrace the narrative that she had ended her week triumphantly. Speaking afterwards, she finished most comments by noting that despite her pride at bouncing back, it “sucked” she had to withdraw from so many events. Beyond the medals and golds, after all of her efforts to make it to Tokyo, it was crushing that she simply could not perform as she wished. But in the months since she returned home, with time and space, Biles has come to fully understand the impact of her decisions. She cherishes the bronze medal and the fortitude it took to gain it. She has said that she often felt in recent years she was competing for other people, and here she decided for herself. In a sport known for creating a toxic culture of overtraining and competing with injuries, she has shown a generation of new gymnasts the importance of prioritising safety and wellbeing. After spending so many years changing her sport within the confines of the competition floor, she did so again by stepping away from it.",Sport/Sport,Jaw-dropping sport moments of 2021: Simone Biles at the Tokyo Olympics,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/25/jaw-dropping-sport-moments-of-2021-simone-biles-at-the-tokyo-olympics
12/25/2021,"The first proposals for a spate of developments designed to meet new green measures in London include a biodiverse training complex at the All England Lawn Tennis Club in Wimbledon, a green-walled skyscraper in the City of London and a densely planted mini forest in Chelsea. Skyscrapers, historic estates and suburban parks across the capital are counting up scores for greenery under new planning metrics set out in Mayor Sadiq Khan’s London Plan, which are intended to enhance developments’ contribution to the environment.  The Urban Greening Factor (UGF) formula, inspired by the Swedish city of Malmö’s “green points” system, scores each part of a development’s plan – including street-level areas, balconies and roofs – from 0 to 1, with trees, planters and green roofs earning high scores, while paving slabs and barren rooftops receive no score. Central government has also set out plans in the Environment Act 2021 to make developments deliver an uplift to biodiversity, which will require a 10% “biodiversity net gain”. The green space factor (GSF) – sometimes called an urban greening factor or green area factor – is a way of calculating green space requirements for new developments. GSF measures typically give each square metre of tarmacked car park a score of zero and every square metre left as open meadow a value of one. Other spaces can earn higher or lower scores. In Malmö, a pond or stormwater system filled with water for more than half the year also scores one, a permeable gravel area with some plants has a value of 0.4, and paved areas designed to channel stormwater into sustainable drainage systems score 0.2. These numbers are added up and divided by the total area of the development to give a score. Cities may demand that each development reaches a minimum target, typically 0.3. “The Urban Greening Factor is a complete step-change in how much green stuff we’re putting on buildings,” said Craig Robertson, head of sustainability at AHMM architects. Even city centre sites will be tasked with achieving a UGF score of 0.4, equivalent to turning 40% of their footprints over to nature. Biodiversity net gain will mark another big shift, Robertson added, pushing developers to consider vegetation and ecological benefits to their surroundings. “It’s really difficult – in a positive way. It’s a really positive challenge to have.” Biodiversity net gain, which will be required in planning law from 2023, uses a complex algorithm to account for nature losses and gains – although critics have called for urgent revisions to the current formula. Although some London boroughs are yet to formally adopt UGF measures, the Greater London Authority (GLA) began requiring it in March, meaning all large developments across the capital must now calculate their score. Draft guidance to help boroughs and developers deliver UGF effectively has been put out for public consultation and will formally be adopted next year. Residential developments are typically set a target of 0.4 and commercial developments 0.3, giving landscape architects and designers “authority and opportunity” to reach these scores in creative ways, said Peter Massini, an ecologist who helped write the UGF policy at the GLA. London was already spattered with green roofs, with 700 in central London alone, but the UGF makes them all but essential in dense urban plots with little street-level space. Green walls offer another way of lifting UGF on crowded sites, but Robertson said many designers are doubtful of their benefits amid a rash of high-profile die-offs. The “cascading” green terraces of The Ray, his practice’s redevelopment of the Guardian’s former headquarters in Farringdon, are one indicator of where the city could be heading under UGF, said Robertson, alongside biosolar roofs, which combine plants growing around photovoltaic panels. The City of London approved a 33-storey “green tower” at 70 Gracechurch Street in February, which exceeded a UGF target of 0.3 with a collection of living roofs, planted terraces and a green wall. Cadogan, the main landlord in Chelsea and Knightsbridge, is targeting a 25% increase in its UGF across its 36-hectare (90-acre) Chelsea estate, including designing a densely planted Miyawaki forest. The UGF incentivises developers to not settle for bland green space, said City Hall. Wild grassland or dense tree planting score more than double typical lawns, meaning lawns can be upgraded to help reach targets in historic areas where buildings are protected. Plans for an extension to the home of the Wimbledon Championships has reached the near-perfect UGF of 0.97, almost totally green space. The All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) bought a former private golf club in 2018 neighbouring the tournament’s courts, on site that been a parkland estate designed by Capability Brown. By 2030, it will provide 39 tennis courts, designed to sit within a “mosaic of habitats”, with much open to the public, said Andrew Wayro, senior landscape design manager at AELTC. While its UGF was already far above the 0.4 requirement at the outset of the project, it aims to push it higher while achieving a 10% biodiversity increase by switching rolling fairways for “priority habitats for the area, like reedbeds and acid grassland” and specialist habitats for hedgehogs and Daubenton’s bats, said Wayro. But the Wimbledon plan has met with objections by some residents, who argue that the development will “cause substantial harm” to the park. Vanessa Ross, founder of Arc Landscape Design and Planning, said it remains up to developers, designers and ecologists whether the new metrics will truly make a difference to lives and ecosystems in London, or simply push architects into “designing by numbers”. For example, private gardens can score highly for green space but offer little benefit to people unless accessible, Ross added.
