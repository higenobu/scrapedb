3/26/2022,"Russian troops ran over their own commander in response to the Ukraine invasion, a Western official said. The official said it was done as ""consequences of the losses they had taken,"" one report said. The official said the colonel died, and an earlier report said he was brought to hospital with injured legs. Russian soldiers ran their commander over in protest of the heavy losses that Russia has suffered during its invasion of Ukraine, a Western official said. The official was cited by several UK defense writers on Friday afternoon. It appeared to confirm a previously-reported story about a senior commander run over by a tank. Larisa Brown, defense editor of The Times of London, tweeted, citing the unnamed official, that the commander ""has been killed by one of his own units"" and that the colonel ""was ran over by his own troops deliberately."" The colonel was named as Colonel Medvechek, commander of 37 Motor Rifle Brigade, by Deborah Haynes, security and defense editor for Sky News, who also cited a Western official. The earlier report had named him as Colonel Yuri Medvedev, a similar but not identical name, The official said he was ""run over by his soldiers,"" according to Haynes. Haynes tweeted that the official said: ""The brigade commander of one of the units was killed by his own troops and killed by his own troops, we believe, as a consequence of the scale of loss that had been taken by his brigade."" Gordon Corera, the security correspondent for the BBC, tweeted a similar account. An earlier report said that the colonel was not killed, but that his feet were crushed. Ukrainian journalist Roman Tsymbaliuk said on Facebook on Wednesday that a soldier ran over the officer's legs with a tank, and that he was brought to a hospital in Belarus. Russia's progress in invading Ukraine has been significantly slower than what Russia expected. Intelligence officials have spoken of very low morale among Russian forces, who appear to be poorly supplied and some of whom have said they were misled about the invasion. A senior NATO member said on Wednesday that up to 15,000 Russian troops may have been killed. Fewer than 3,000 American troops were killed in Afghanistan over 20 years.

3/26/2022,"A Google employee is sharing the everyday perks she enjoys at the tech company’s offices. This jealousy-inducing insight comes courtesy of a TikToker named Sophie (@sophielawlor5), who appears to work at Google’s offices in Dublin, Ireland. Her clip, which now has over 7 million views, shows an apparently regular workday — and all the food, relaxation and office perks that are included. Can switching your auto insurance really save you money during the holidays? An expert weighs in Her video is just the latest popular TikTok that gives a behind-the-scenes look at interesting work lives. Earlier this month, a former “HQ Trivia” host went viral sharing how much money she made per episode. Before that, a former pro football player explained what NFL waterboys “actually do.” Google employees in particular have consistently sparked interest on the app. Last year, a former employee shared what it was like to work at the company’s Bay Area office. Sophie’s tour of the Dublin office drew a similar reaction. Her tour started in the morning with a trip to the breakfast buffet. Then, she showed off a fancy-looking coffee machine, followed by some time working from a remote-controlled massage chair. Next, she had lunch at a vast buffet line. Then she got some “fresh air,” on a rooftop patio featuring some colorful swing sets. Finally, Sophie shared clips of her desk area and a stationery cubby. TikTokers had strong reactions to the clip. Many expressed their jealousy over Sophie’s job. With just $1,000 and one day, this Harlem bedroom gets a brand new look: “I wanna work at Google,” one commenter wrote. “Why am I a nurse again?” another joked. “Google looks after their staff,” another replied. Other users wondered whether all the perks really beat staying at home, and some questioned how they affect productivity. “I’ll take working from home over this any day,” one user wrote. “Do you actually do any work or are you just eating there?” another added. Google’s offices, especially the famous “Googleplex” in Mountain View, Calif., have long been the subject of fascination. The company’s vast array of office perks — along with its employee benefits — have earned it an extremely strong talent retention score by comparison with other companies. However, some have commented that the cushy surroundings at the offices come with a downside. In a 2022 interview with NPR, Clive Wilkinson, the architect behind the Googleplex design, said the campus was “dangerous” because it made workers too dependent on their employer. “This notion that you can provide everything that would support a worker’s life on campus might appear to be extremely generous and supportive,” Wilkinson said. “But it also has a whole range of potentially negative impacts.” Amber Riley's favorite Black-owned beauty brands for glowing skin: The post Google employee wows TikTok with tour of her everyday office perks appeared first on In The Know.
