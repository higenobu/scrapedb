3/23/2022,"A 23-year-old woman visiting a Disney park alleged on TikTok that she was “dress coded” and asked to wear a replacement shirt. User @toragrams did not specify what theme park she was in but based on her TikTok bio identifying her as being Florida, outlets like Newsweek have suggested that it was at Walt Disney World in Orlando. According to the Disney World site, “Disney reserves the right to deny admission to or remove any person wearing attire that is considered inappropriate.” With just $1,000 and one day, this Harlem bedroom gets a brand new look: In terms of what constitutes “inappropriate,” the site adds, “clothing which, by nature, exposes portions of the skin that may be viewed as inappropriate for a family environment.” This isn’t the first time a woman has gone viral for claiming that an amusement park employee dubbed her outfit “inappropriate.” A year ago, a mom shared a whole saga on TikTok after a Six Flags employee allegedly asked her to leave the park over the length of her shorts, which went so viral Six Flags actually responded to it. It’s not just limited to amusement parks either — in June 2021, two 20-year-olds were asked to leave a bar because the manager said they were basically “topless,” and a few months later a woman was told to “wait outside” while getting her car fixed because she was wearing a crop top. In @toragrams’s case, she filmed herself wearing a black cropped cardigan that tied in the center. It was clear @toragrams was not wearing anything underneath the cardigan, and one commenter who claimed to have worked at Disney said that “the rule is that your top can’t have just a string to hold it together.” The TikToker didn’t seem to have any hard feelings about the incident and even captured the video, which now has almost 6 million views, with: “I mean, I kinda agree [with] them looking back at this video.” Protocol for being “dress coded” was for @toragrams to receive a voucher to go pick up a new shirt. While @toragrams mentioned that the shirt was free for her, other viewers debated in the comments whether that was always the case. Other commenters seemed confused about why, specifically, @toragrams’s shirt was questioned — considering that most of her upper body was covered by the cardigan. “Honestly that crop isn’t even bad. It’s just cute, what’s the problem?” one person asked. “I don’t see anything wrong with your outfit…??” another said. “It’s hot in Florida..?” But several people pointed out that the strings could come off on rides or, worse, get tangled on them and potentially injure someone. “I worked at Disney World, and even though it’s NOT a bad top … you reach over 80mph winds on coasters and rides,” someone pointed out.

3/23/2022,"Two Arizona sisters who were reported missing by their family in Switzerland died by assisted suicide, authorities say. Lila Ammouri, a doctor, and registered nurse Susan Frazier flew to Basel, Switzerland on 3 February, and had been due to return to the United States on 13 February. When they failed to show up for work at Aetna Health Insurance in Phoenix, friends and family appealed for help to find them. Their deaths were confirmed by the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs on 19 February, but no cause of death was given. A spokesman for the Basel-Landschaft Public Prosecutor’s Office confirmed to The Independent that the sisters had died by suicide “within the legal framework”. “The public prosecutor’s office of the Canton of Basel-Landschaft confirms that the two US women died during their stay in Switzerland. They both committed suicide – with the help of an assisted suicide organisation,” Michael Lutz told The Independent. Mr Lutz said assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland “under certain conditions”. “In the specific case, the on-site checks by the authorities revealed that the assisted suicide took place within the legal framework, so that the Basel-Landschaft public prosecutor’s office did not open a criminal investigation.” Brother Cal Ammouri told The Independent he had last spoken to his sisters a few weeks before they travelled to Switzerland, and they had appeared health and happy. He had not been told an official cause of death by the US Consular services, he said. “Nobody else really knows the specifics,” he told The Independent. Mr Ammouri, who lives in New York City, said he was still coming to terms with the loss of his two sisters, who were his only living family. Both sisters were adored by everyone who met them, he said. “They were really special. They never hurt anybody. They were always helping everybody. They would go out of their way to help people, which is rare. According to an online profile, Dr Ammouri, 54, was a hospice and palliative care specialist in Flagstaff, Arizona. She practised at Flagstaff Medical Center where she was “board certified in Hospice Care and Palliative Medicine”. Ms Frazier, 49, was remembered as a “smart, fast” operator at work who had recently been promoted to the nurse leadership team at Aetna Health Insurance. One friend said Ms Frazier was always smiling, and “could laugh the stress away”. The two sisters were described as “best friends” who did everything together. After they were reported missing, it was initially suspected they might have been the victims of foul play. Longtime friend David Biglari said the last text he received from Ms Ammouri had spelling mistakes that were completely out of character. He told KPHO that friends had “reason to believe” someone else was texting them from the sisters’ devices. In a separate interview, Dr Biglari said red flags had been raised when the sisters didn’t turn up for work. “Are they being held somewhere, hostage? Held for ransom?” According to Swissinfo.ch, around 1,300 people died by assisted suicide in Switzerland in 2020. Most are carried out with the assistance of the two largest assisted suicide organisations, Dignitas and Exit. In the United States, physician-assisted dying is legal in Washington, DC and nine states: California, Oregon, Colorado, Vermont, New Mexico, Maine, New Jersey, Hawaii and Washington. Legislation has also passed to allow assisted dying in Montana, but its status is disputed after a 2009 court ruling. Euthanasia, which involves another person administering a lethal dose, is banned under federal law.",World/The Independent,"Arizona sisters who went missing in Switzerland died by assisted suicide, authorities say",https://news.yahoo.com/arizona-sisters-went-missing-switzerland-133819450.html
3/23/2022,"The Queen and Prince Charles are reportedly thinking of ways they can offer 'practical support' to Ukrainian refugees who have fled their country following the Russian invasion. So far, over three million Ukrainians have left their homes to seek refuge across Europe. Now, the Royal Household is possibly preparing to open its doors and provide a place for those entering the UK from Ukraine to live. According to a source who spoke to OK!, Balmoral – the Queen's 50,000 acre Scottish estate – has been approached to host Ukrainian refugees in the accommodation typically used by staff. ""Balmoral have been approached and I understand are keen to help but there are practicalities to overcome,"" the insider said. ""However these should not be insurmountable given the goodwill out there."" Seemingly confirming the news, a Royal Household spokesperson responded: ""The Royal Household is looking at a number of ways to offer practical help and support."" In addition to the doors at the Balmoral estate potentially being opened up, Prince Charles is apparently thinking about welcoming refugees at his Scottish estate, Dumfries House, as well. News of the Queen potentially hosting Ukrainian refugees comes just weeks after she showed a subtle sign of support for the war-torn country. During her first engagement since testing positive with COVID-19, Her Majesty met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and a blue and yellow floral arrangement – representing the colours of the Ukrainian flag – could be seen sitting on the console table in her Windsor Castle parlour room. Prior to that, the Queen made a ""generous donation"" to support the people of Ukraine, confirmed by The Disasters Emergency Committee. ""Many thanks to Her Majesty The Queen for continuing to support the Disasters Emergency Committee and for making a generous donation to the DEC Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal,"" the organisation wrote in a tweet, thanking the Queen for her help. And she's not alone, with both Kate Middleton and Prince William pitching in too with a visit to the Ukrainian Cultural Centre in London where they met volunteers gathering supplies. Showing their support for the Ukrainian people, the Duke and Duchess both wore badges displaying the Ukrainian flag, and told volunteers: ""We are all behind you."" They also touched upon how their three children have been dealing with the conflict, pointing out they've been having ""difficult"" conversations with them about it. ""Ours [children] have been coming home asking all about it,"" William explained. ""They are obviously talking about it with their friends at school.""

3/23/2022,"During the second day of Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Sen. Lindsey Graham grilled the nominee on her faith and judicial record before storming off during a back and forth about detainees in Guantanamo Bay. Graham has made it clear from the very beginning that he is not supportive of Jackson's nomination over South Carolina's J. Michelle Childs. Just a day ago, Graham said Childs' nomination was botched by the ""radical left"" wing of the Democratic Party and that he and Sen. Tim Scott and several other GOP lawmakers would have supported the judge. ""The attacks from the Left against Judge Childs was really pretty vicious, to be honest with you,"" Graham said to Jackson. Live updates: Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson speaks on abortion, her faith, CRT, Gitmo in hearing ""So you say Judge Jackson, you don't have any judicial philosophy per se. Well, somebody on the left believes you do, or they went and spent the money to have you in this chair,"" Graham continued, making unverified statements of dark money groups bankrolling Jackson's candidature. Graham rounded up GOP grievances and said that conservatives are focusing more on philosophy than someone's ""race"" Graham added that Democrats and the press hounded other nominees Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett during their hearings. ""The media will be your biggest cheerleader. They're in your camp,"" Graham said. ""They have every right to pick who they want to pick. There won't be this constant attack on you like judge Kavanaugh and other conservative judicial appointments. ""They won't be any questioning of where you go to church. What kind of groups you're in in church, how you decide to raise your kids, what you believe in how you believe in God, nobody's gonna do that,"" Graham said to Jackson. ""And that's a good thing. So you're the beneficiary of a lot. You're the beneficiary of Republican nominees having their life turned upside down, and it didn't work."" During his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh was accused of sexually harassing Christine Blasey Ford, a professor of psychology. Last year, Politico reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation received 4,500 tips but chose not to investigate it and sent them to the White House instead. In a letter, an FBI official said that she was concerned that the Trump administration may have under investigated or dismissed the tips on Kavanaugh. A day after telling Jackson that she would not be 'vilified' for her views on her faith, Graham spent a lot of time circling her faith and how she engages with it in her daily life. ""On a scale of one to ten, how faithful would you say you are in terms of religion?"" Graham asked. Jackson said that she was a non-denominational Protestant and that her faith was very important to her. ""But as you know there’s no religious test in the Constitution,"" Jackson said, continuing that she was ""reluctant"" to talk about her faith in public interest and the groups who expected her to separate her personal views from her work. The flashpoint of the hearing came when Graham focused on Jackson's record as a public defender for Guantanamo Bay detainees and how she had referred to the Bush administration as ""war criminals"" in a brief written years ago and also said that Gitmo, a shortened name for the detention camp, had a high recidivism rate. Here, Dick Durbin, D-IL, the Senate Judiciary Committee Chair intervened and added context to Graham's statements. ""On the issue of Guantanamo, 39 detainees remain. It’s $450 million per year. Each of these detainees is being held at the expense of $12 or $13 million per year. If they would be incarcerated in Florence, Colorado, the supermax federal prison, the amount would be dramatically less,"" Durbin said. ""Since 2009, with the beginning of the Obama Administration, the repeat rate of Guantanamo detainees is 5 percent.” Graham directed his ire towards Durbin and asked the Democrat if he supported the detention of Gitmo prisoners. Several international and domestic human rights groups have said that Guantanamo Bay, though aimed to detain 9/11 suspects, has been in the center of violating the Third Geneva Convention, the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention Against Torture (CAT), and customary international law, which includes violations such as illegal and indefinite detention, torture, inhumane conditions and unfair trials (military commissions). During the heated argument, Jackson said that her job as a public defender for the detainees was enshrined in the constitution. In response, Graham said, ""As long as they're dangerous, I hope they all die in jail if they're going to go back to kill Americans. It won't bother me one bit if 39 of them die in prison. That's a better outcome than letting them go and if it cost $500 million to keep them in jail, keep them in jail because they'll go back to the fight. Look at the freaking Afghan government made up of former detainees at Gitmo. This whole thing by the left about this war ain't working!” After that, the senator stormed out and said that Jackson's answers raised ""red flags"" for him, hinting that he would not vote for the nominee, even as he's voted to nominate her to the Circuit Court before. If picked, Jackson, a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, would be the sixth woman, and the first Black woman to preside over the high court.

3/23/2022,"Two parents have been charged with manslaughter after allegedly allowing their daughter to become morbidly obese. In what is believed to be the first case of its kind, the parents of Kaylea Titford, 16, appeared in court on Tuesday after being charged with gross negligence manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable person. The disabled teenage girl was found dead at her home in Newtown, Powys, Wales, in October 2020. It is alleged that between March 24 and Oct 11, 2020, Kaylea's father Alun Titford, 44, and mother Sarah Lloyd-Jones, 39, of Colwyn, Newtown, failed to ensure that her dietary needs were met, leading to morbid obesity. Nor did they ensure that she got enough exercise, was in a hygienic condition, had a safe and hygienic environment, that her physical health was maintained or that reasonable medical help was sought, the charge claims. The pair appeared before Welshpool Magistrates' Court on Tuesday and stood together in the dock wearing face masks. They spoke only to confirm their names, ages and address, but did not enter any pleas. Helen Tench, prosecuting, asked both defendants to remain on conditional bail and not to have contact with anyone under the age of 18. They will appear before Mold Crown Court on April 14. The case is believed to be the first time parents have been charged with such an offence. In 2014, two parents were arrested on suspicion of cruelty and neglect of their obese child. A 49-year-old man and a 44-year-old woman, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, were questioned by officers over the child's care and released on bail. At the time of the separate case, Norfolk Police said intervention at this level was ""very rare"" and only occurred where other attempts to protect the child had been unsuccessful. According to reports, the 11-year-old boy in the case was 5ft 1in tall and 15 stone, with a body mass index (BMI) of 41.8. ""When dealing with sensitive issues such as obesity and neglect of children, officers from the force's Child Abuse Investigation Unit work closely with partners, significantly with both health care and social services, to ensure any response to address them are proportionate and necessary,"" Norfolk Police said in 2014. However, the case against the parents in Norfolk was dropped and they were not prosecuted.",U.S./The Telegraph,Couple charged with manslaughter over death of morbidly obese daughter,https://news.yahoo.com/couple-charged-manslaughter-over-death-201203499.html
3/23/2022,"There’s a lot of talk about menopause. But menopause doesn’t happen overnight. There’s a transitional period before the start of menopause that many women don’t know much about. It’s called perimenopause, and it’s “characterized by gradual decline in ovarian function,” Dr. Kecia Gaither, director of perinatal services at NYC Health + Hospitals/Lincoln in the Bronx, tells Yahoo Life. Perimenopause “generally begins in the 40s,” says Gaither, “but may begin in the 30s or even earlier, depending on genetics or other medical conditions.” It also lasts longer than you might expect. On average, perimenopause lasts about four years, according to the Cleveland Clinic. During this time period, a woman’s ovaries slowly make less and less estrogen until the onset of menopause — defined as going through 12 consecutive months without a period, according to the Mayo Clinic. Hormonal levels tend to fluctuate during perimenopause, going “up and down like a rollercoaster,” according to a Cleveland Clinic website. Every woman is different, but symptoms of perimenopause usually include irregular periods, hot flashes, lowered libido, fatigue and exhaustion, breast tenderness, discomfort during sex due to vaginal dryness, mood swings, insomnia and urinary urgency. Irregular periods are one of the first signs that perimenopause has started. This can include longer or shorter days between periods, flow that’s lighter or heavier than usual periods or skipped periods, according to the Mayo Clinic. However, since abnormal periods can indicate other serious conditions, it’s important to see a doctor if your periods become very heavy including clotting, last several days longer than normal or you experience spotting or bleeding after a period or after sex. That said, it’s possible to be going through perimenopause and not realize it. Women’s health expert Dr. Jennifer Wider tells Yahoo Life that “there have been reports of people not experiencing severe enough symptoms to recognize anything. In some women, symptoms are so subtle and gradual, they don't recognize them until their period completely stops.” While perimenopause is a natural process that signals the end of a woman’s reproductive years, some of the symptoms associated with this transition period may benefit from treatment. “Low-dose birth control pills or other hormonal options are sometimes prescribed to help with the hot flashes,” explains Wider. Estrogen therapy, which comes in several forms including gel, cream, vaginal ring or pill, can be prescribed in some cases to stabilize estrogen levels and help with symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Gabapentin, a seizure medication, can also help some women with hot flashes. While hormone therapy is used in some instances, it’s worth noting that that option carries an increased risk of uterine cancer, stroke, heart attack, blood clots and gallbladder disease, so it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits with your primary care physician. In some cases, your primary care physician may recommend an antidepressant, which research shows can help lessen the frequency and severity of hot flashes. In addition, Wider says that some women benefit from using a vaginal lubricant to counter vaginal dryness. According to the North American Menopause Society, “During perimenopause, less estrogen may cause the tissues of the vulva and the lining of the vagina to become thinner, drier, and less elastic or flexible,” adding that “vaginal secretions are reduced, resulting in decreased lubrication.” When it comes to managing most natural changes in our bodies, maintaining a healthy lifestyle by eating a balanced diet; exercising consistently (including strength training); and incorporating stress management techniques such as deep breathing, meditation or yoga into your life, can make a difference. You'll experience a lot of changes in your 40s, especially when it comes to your period. Watch the video to find out how perimenopause might affect you.

3/23/2022,"A bear in Connecticut got more than it bargained for when it picked a fight with two pigs. Instead of a quick snack, the bear soon found itself in a fight of its life with two Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs in New Milford: Owners Kevin David and Rebecca Shaw told local media the pigs’ names are Hammy and Mary. “I am very proud of them because Hammy, the little one especially, he’s afraid of his own shadow and the way he came charging out when he seen Mary tussling with the bear,” Shaw told NBC Connecticut. “He was like, ‘Oh no, no way, get out.’” Despite the bear battle, the pigs were no worse for wear. “They’re fine,” David told WTNH, the ABC station in New Haven. “They’re some heavy pigs and we’re pretty sure that bear is still a cub.” Fox 61 noted that the Connecticut legislature is considering a bill that would legalize the shooting and killing of “nuisance” bears in some situations, such as the destruction of crops and beehives.

A “UFO researcher” says he has discovered evidence of ancient aliens at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The researcher, Scott Waring, shared the discovery earlier this month. Waring believes that a circular object he found off the coast of Nazca, Peru while perusing Google Earth is in fact a submerged UFO.

There has always been a lot of skepticism about the prospect that aliens exist. Some scientists believe that alien life exists on planets we have yet to discover. Others believe that aliens have visited Earth, resulting in the mass of “UFO sightings” that have been reported over the years. There are even some that make a case that octopuses are aliens. No matter what camp you fall in, the story of this submerged UFO is definitely an intriguing find. The UFO, which Waring reported on in early March, was discovered while Waring was “exploring” the Pacific Ocean using Google Earth. The object in question is a dark circle, and it can be found off the Peruvian coast. Waring believes that the object is an almost 5-mile-wide UFO sitting at the bottom of the ocean. He also believes that it is somehow directly connected to the Nazca Lines in Peru. This connection, he says is amplified because of the submerged UFO’s proximity to the lines. The Nazca Lines are a group of geoglyphs in the Nazca Desert. Archaeologists have long connected the lines as a possible attempt to contact deities in the sky. Others believe they were used as points of observation related to cosmology and astronomy. Unfortunately, because they’re so old, we may never know the true meaning behind them. Waring believes that the deities the people in ancient Nazca culture were trying to contact could have been aliens, though. Sure, anything is possible, but there’s no solid proof to suggest that as fact. Waring seems intent that the object is a submerged UFO, though. In his original post he writes, “this disk at the bottom of the ocean is 100% proof of ancient aliens and the technology is just sitting there on the bottom of the ocean.” But is it, really? While the thought of finding a submerged UFO in the Pacific Ocean is enough to get any fans of alien life excited, there’s just no solid proof to suggest that this object is actually a UFO. It could just as easily be something natural on the bottom of the ocean or even submerged trash of some kind. Without any distinct proof, there’s just no way to say for sure. There may be alien life out there. After all, it’s a big universe. Unfortunately, we just don’t know. What we do know, though, is that even scientists looking for alien life haven’t been able to find it. Could this new object be another clue to the existence of aliens? I guess that’s up to you to decide. Click here to read the full article.

3/23/2022,"(Adds background) March 21 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Monday it was recalling some lots of blood pressure drug Accuretic and two authorized cheaper versions of the drug due to the presence of elevated levels of a nitrosamine, a potential cancer-causing impurity. Pfizer said https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-voluntary-nationwide-recall-lots-accuretictm it has not received any reports of adverse events related to the drug till date. Nitrosamines are common in water and foods, including cured and grilled meats, dairy products and vegetables. Exposure to the impurities above acceptable levels over long periods of time could increase the risk of cancer. However, there is no immediate risk to patients taking the drug, Pfizer said. Patients currently taking the products should consult with their doctor about alternative treatment options, the drugmaker said. Pfizer Canada earlier this month recalled Accuretic due to the presence of the same impurity.

3/23/2022,"Ukraine says it's killed at least five Russian generals, an unusually high total for senior officers. A European diplomat told Foreign Policy that poor communications were leaving commanders exposed. Russia is sustaining high overall casualties in its invasion of Ukraine. Russian generals are moving into advanced positions leaving them exposed to attacks because they're struggling to get their orders through to conscripts, a European official told Foreign Policy magazine. Ukrainian officials have said Ukrainian forces have killed at least five Russian generals so far. Such a toll is unusually high for such senior officers. On Saturday, Ukraine said its forces had killed Lt. Gen. Andrei Mordvichev when they struck an airfield near Kherson, one of the few Ukrainian cities Russia has managed to occupy. On Sunday, Russian officials said a senior naval commander, Andrei Paly, had been killed by Ukrainian forces near the besieged city of Mariupol. A European diplomat briefed on intelligence reports told Foreign Policy that a failure of Russian communications systems was leaving generals exposed to interception and targeted strikes. The diplomat also said that difficulties in getting conscripted troops to follow orders were making them take positions close to the front. The Russian military is using conscripts alongside its regular military in the invasion of Ukraine, despite having promised that it would not. Experts have said conscripted troops are often poorly trained and have low morale. ""They're struggling on the front line to get their orders through,"" the European diplomat said. ""They're having to go to the front line to make things happen, which is putting them at much greater risk than you would normally see."" The diplomat said that about 20% of Russia's top commanders in Ukraine had been killed in the conflict, reducing its military effectiveness and stalling its advance. The theory corroborates a report published Monday by Insider's Christopher Woody. The report cited a US official as saying Russian generals were at inherently greater risk than their US counterparts because of a Russian command structure that gives lower-ranking officers less autonomy and demands closer involvement of generals. US officials believe that about 7,000 Russian troops have been killed in the fighting so far. On Monday, a Russian tabloid reported, citing the country's defense ministry, that the death toll was higher than 9,000, but it subsequently retracted the claim.

3/23/2022,"DECATUR, Ala. (AP) — An Alabama liquor store owner has sued after a police officer responding to a robbery call at his store punched him in the face and broke his jaw in March 2020. The Decatur Daily reports that Kevin Penn sued the city of Decatur and police officer Justin Rippen on March 11 in federal court. Penn is Black and Rippen is white. The suit alleges the incident is an example of systematic use of “excessive force” by the Decatur Police Department that the city often ignores. The lawsuit alleges Penn’s constitutional rights were violated by illegal seizure, false arrest and excessive force, seeking money damages. City Attorney Herman Marks said Thursday his department hasn’t yet received the lawsuit and declined comment. Decatur Mayor Tab Bowling said he regrets a lawsuit has been filed but referred questions to Marks. The lawsuit alleges the city regularly receives complaints that officers “react with unjustifiable violence and false charges when a citizen speaks up or otherwise asserts his rights as an American citizen.” The suit also accuses officers of “using common charges like obstructing governmental operation, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest” against local citizens. “It is well known in the Decatur legal community that Decatur officers frequently use these charges, commonly referred to as POP (p— off police) charges, without a legal basis,” the lawsuit states. Penn had trapped a shoplifter with an electronic lock and the suspect was lying on the ground, with Penn holding him at gunpoint. Surveillance video shows Penn unloading his gun as police arrive. The video appears to show Penn setting the gun magazine down as the officers approach. An officer walked past the suspect and told Penn to put down his weapon. Penn refused saying, “I have a right to have my gun,"" according to body camera video. But police said in 2020 they believed Penn was reloading the gun. An officer, who has been identified as Rippen, then appears to punch Penn. Rippen and two other officers wrestled Penn to the ground and handcuffed him, the video shows. Penn was arrested and charged with obstructing a robbery investigation. Penn's lawyer, Hank Sherrod III, said using the obstructing governmental operations charge “is standard procedure for most police jurisdictions and 100% used in north Alabama.” The lawsuit says city officials failed to ensure officers were properly trained and supervised. City leaders were aware of numerous situations “in which citizens were subjected to unconstitutional stops, searches, arrests and uses of force but took no action to investigate and discipline officers,” the lawsuit says. Penn spent six weeks with his jaws wired shut as he recovered. Sherrod said the misdemeanor charges against Penn are still pending. “I don’t know why they’re still active or they haven’t set a court date,” Sherrod said. Sherrod said Penn “promptly” filed regarding the assault and false arrest complaint after he was punched “and the city did nothing. Mr. Penn hasn’t heard from the city to this day.” Rippen wasn’t disciplined, the Penn lawsuit says. No investigation began until the video became public in June 2020, three months after it happened.",U.S./Associated Press,"Black store owner reports robbery, gets punched by officer",https://news.yahoo.com/black-store-owner-reports-robbery-001343889.html
