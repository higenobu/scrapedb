2/12/2022,"Two drivers are facing charges after a chaotic road rage encounter on a North Carolina highway was captured on video, according to state law enforcement officials. The nearly two-minute video posted on Facebook just after 8 a.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 9, showed a white van and black sedan swerving in and out of traffic before a North Carolina State Trooper caught up to them. The person recording, identified by WAVY as Pete Denny, provided colorful commentary throughout. “Look at this fool,” Denny said in the first few seconds of the video. “Look, look at this dude, man. Going in the right lane! Boy, somebody p----d somebody off this morning.” The video has been watched more than 434,000 times and generated over 4,000 reactions and comments as of 5 p.m. on Feb. 11. It was also posted on the “Public Freakout” Reddit page, which has 3.8 million followers. Christopher D. Knox, a spokesperson with the N.C. State Highway Patrol, identified the drivers as 62-year-old Jerry Ray Wyatt, of Eden, and 25-year-old Joshua Ian Livesay, of Mayodan. Both were charged with failure to maintain lane control and careless or reckless driving. Their first court date is April 14 at 8:30 a.m. Knox said a trooper assigned to Guilford County first clocked the two drivers at 7:20 a.m. on N.C. 68 near Pleasant Ridge Road on Feb. 9. Wyatt was driving a white Nissan van and Livesay was driving a black Mazda. The trooper pulled them over after a “near collision,” Knox said. Denny, who owns TGI Turf Services Inc. and posted a video of the encounter on his business’ Facebook page, had been driving behind them for several minutes before law enforcement arrived. At the start of the recording, the utility van is seen swerving to the right of a semi-truck carrying lumber and driving on the shoulder in an apparent attempt to overtake the Nissan. A few seconds later, Denny is heard saying that “they’ve been at it for at least six or eight minutes trying to cut each other off.” The driver of the van made a second attempt to pass the Mazda as they approached the Oak Ridge exit on N.C. 68 by speeding into the exit lane, swerving around a Penske moving truck before getting back on the highway, the video shows. “Golly, there he goes again,” Denny said in the video. “He’s going to kill somebody!” The van then continued to tail the Mazda from behind as they changed lanes. “He is all up on that lady. Look, road rage! Get away from her, dude,” Denny said in response, unknowingly thinking the Mazda was driven by a woman instead of Livesay. He added that he was unknowingly driving 100 mph to keep up with them. The video cut to a different section of roadway at about the one-minute mark as the two drivers tried to merge into traffic. The van, however, got too close, and the black car is seen running off the road into the center median. “Uh-oh, uh-oh,” Denny can be heard saying. “That’s what happens.” That’s when a state trooper shoots through traffic with lights flashing. “Oh snap, get em’, get em’, I hope that’s the law,” Denny said after the near-crash. “Yeah! Yeah! Get em’ baby! Tear his head up! Woohoo! Good guys win!” In the final seconds of the video, a trooper can be seen immediately exiting his car as Denny drives by.

2/12/2022,"If you can't get the backing of former President Donald Trump, perhaps that of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) will suffice. According to four ""longtime Republican operatives"" working on competitive GOP primaries nationwide, an MTG endorsement is ""not only considered as welcome, but also as one that should be actively courted,"" The Daily Beast reports, noting the congressmember's power lies in her direct line to the former president, as well as her large network of grassroots donors. ""It is stunning,"" one source told The Daily Beast. ""Her popularity among much of the base and what she brings to a campaign right now is not nothing. Actually, it can be good for the candidate, and I don't know if I would have predicted that a year ago."" ""If you can't get Donald Trump, you are going to want to have MTG in your back pocket,"" said another operative, who also ""professed zero personal admiration for Greene,"" The Daily Beast notes. At this point, at least seven Republican candidates have earned Greene's stamp of approval, including the ""loudly pro-Trump"" Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.). Typically, Greene's been picking mostly challengers to Republicans who have broken from Trump, ""either by impeaching him or criticizing him faintly, or even by working with Democrats,"" writes The Daily Beast. ""It's not that everyone is trying to get her endorsement, but … if you're running on 'Let's own the libs,' and 'Let's be culture warriors,' that's where you go,"" veteran Republican strategist Doug Heye told The Daily Beast. ""One of the things we've seen over the past decade-plus now, but that Donald Trump really drove home, is that politics is performance art."" Added former Cobb County, Georgia GOP chair Jason Shepherd of Greene's now-coveted endorsement: ""I did not see that coming when I first met Marjorie.""

2/12/2022,"Talk show star Wendy Williams is at risk of defaulting on her mortgage and leaving her employees without pay after Wells Fargo Advisors froze access to her accounts, according to court documents. While the money manager said it believed Williams was being financially exploited, Williams has filed a petition in New York state court asking a judge for an injunction that would give her control again over accounts worth several million dollars. ""Until Wells Fargo reopens my personal, business, deferred compensation, and investment accounts, unfreezes my financial assets, my family and I are at risk of suffering continued irreparable financial harm,"" Williams said in court papers. Williams, 57, is a native of Asbury Park and Ocean Township, and lived in Livingston. The legal battle over her finances comes as Williams is struggling with medical issues. Producers reportedly have plans for her eponymous series to move on with a new host. Williams last appeared on ""The Wendy Williams Show"" to close out its 12th season in July 2021. In her petition for an emergency injunction filed Feb. 4, Williams' lawyers said the talk show host lost access to her accounts after Wells Fargo financial adviser Lori Schiller said Williams was unsound. Williams fired Schiller and alleged improper conduct in their professional relationship, the court papers said, but Wells Fargo has continued to deny Williams access to her financial assets and statements, even as bills are coming due. in its response, Wells Fargo said regulators have increasingly been urging finance companies to beware of possible exploitation of their clients. It froze Williams' accounts because it had reason to believe Williams was the victim of undue influence and financial exploitation, according to court documents. Wells Fargo said the financial adviser has an unblemished record over a 23-year career and noticed telltale signs of exploitation, including Williams' own apprehensions, court papers said. ""Wells Fargo’s priority is the financial well-being of Ms. Williams and the preservation of her privacy,"" the company said in a statement. ""As we have expressed to the Court, Wells Fargo is open to working with Ms. Williams’ counsel to release funds directly to her creditors for bills historically and regularly paid from her accounts."" Williams' show launched Season 13 in October featuring a string of guest hosts, while Williams — who has the autoimmune disorder Graves' disease and a thyroid condition — remained off-air due to medical issues. Williams also tested positive for a breakthrough case of COVID-19 in September.  Sherri Shepherd, who has been among the series' replacement emcees, is on deck to become a permanent guest host, TMZ reported on Tuesday. According to TMZ, who cited ""multiple sources with direct knowledge,"" if Williams is not well enough to return by September, Shepherd will take over as the star, and the name of the series would be changed. A representative from ""The Wendy Williams Show"" did not respond to a request for an official comment on Friday morning.
