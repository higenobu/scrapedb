2/27/2022,"More EU countries – including France, Italy and Greece – have said they would back a ban on Russia using the Swift global payments network in a bid to pile further pressure on the country after its invasion of Ukraine. Cyprus and Hungary also said they would support such a measure. The move, which it is hoped would hit Russian trade by making it harder for companies in the country to do business, is being considered to escalate sanctions on Vladimir Putin’s regime. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, warned on Thursday that European and US politicians would have “blood on their hands” if they did not support a ban. The following day, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said a ban did not get the “necessary unanimity” but that it would remain a possibility for future consideration. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said on Friday she did not believe a ban was the best course of action and France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said one should be used only as a final resort. But on Saturday Kuleba said the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, had supported cutting Russia out of Swift during a phone call with him. Writing on Twitter, he also said that France was ready to supply Ukraine with weapons and military equipment. Call with my French counterpart @JY_LeDrian. France supports banning Russia from SWIFT. I urged to immediately introduce the third package of EU sanctions to stop Russian invasion. France is also ready to supply weapons and military equipment to help Ukraine defend itself. The office of the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, also said it would support any EU sanctions. In a statement, his office said Draghi had spoken to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday, reiterating that the country would “fully support the European Union line on sanctions against Russia, including on Swift”. Greece said it would support any EU line on sanctions against Russia. A senior government official told Reuters: “Greece will support the EU’s line on sanctions, including on Swift.” Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, also called Zelenskiy on Saturday, saying that the country supported the harshest EU sanctions and was ready to provide assistance. Hungary said it would support all EU sanctions. Speaking during a visit to the Ukrainian-Hungarian border the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said: “Hungary made clear that we support all the sanctions, so we will block nothing, so what the prime ministers of the European Union are able to agree, we accept it and we support it.” He added: “This is the time to be united, it’s a war.” The Cypriot finance minister, Constantinos Petrides, also said Cyprus would not oppose any EU sanctions. “In the name of EU unity and solidarity to Ukrainian people Cyprus has not objected to any EU sanctions including cutting Russia off Swift,” Petrides wrote on Twitter, adding that “everything is on the table”. It followed speculation that Cyprus, which has significant business links with Russia and Ukraine, was among countries with reservations about cutting Russia from Swift. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has been pushing for Russia to be banned from Swift but on Friday said that it was not within Britain’s control. Meanwhile, the governor of a central bank within the eurozone said on Saturday that a decision on Swift would be taken within days and a ban was “just a matter of time”. The unnamed banker told Reuters: “Is it sufficient? No. Is it necessary? Absolutely. Sanctions only make sense if there are costs for both sides and this will be costly.”",News/World news,Swift: EU leaders line up to back banning Russia from banking network ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/swift-eu-leaders-line-up-to-back-banning-russia-from-banking-network
2/27/2022,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will on Saturday accept an award from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a leading US civil rights group, in recognition of their work to help a woman’s shelter in Texas, their promotion of Covid vaccine equity and a partnership to create community relief centers. The NAACP president’s award is given each year in recognition of special achievement and distinguished public service. It has been won by Muhammad Ali, LeBron James, Rihanna, Jay-Z and Lauryn Hill, and political figures including the Rev Jesse Jackson, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. In a statement, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said: “It’s a true honor to be recognized by Derrick Johnson and the NAACP, whose efforts to propel racial justice and civil rights are as vital today as they were nearly 115 years ago [when the NAACP was formed].” Johnson, the NAACP president, said the couple had “heeded the call to social justice and have joined the struggle for equity both in the US and around the world”. The NAACP also created a new award in partnership with the couple and their charity, Archewell. The NAACP-Archewell digital civil rights award, which will recognize leaders at the intersection of social justice and technology, comes with a $100,000 prize. Johnson said the couple had “decided to inspire the next generation of activists … ensuring the support and recognition of generations of civil rights leaders to come”. The first recipient will be Safiya Noble, author of Algorithms of Oppression, a 2018 study of how internet search engines serve to reinforce racial and sexist bias. “Digital civil rights and protections from harm on the internet are a crucial pathway to a more just world,” Noble said. Noble’s work on how digital technologies reinforce cultural, race and gender stereotypes began after it was suggested she use Google to search for the term “black girls”, and was horrified to find that search results led to pornographic sites. When the couple announced the formation of their Archewell charity, two years ago, they put out a note explaining its purpose. They said they believed in the “best of humanity” and said they would “work to build a better world, one act of compassion at a time”. “I am my mother’s son,” Harry said, referring to Princess Diana. “And I am our son’s mother.” Organisers said the NAACP awards ceremony, to be broadcast in the US by BET on Saturday night, would include a performance by Mary J Blige and appearances by Issa Rae, Kerry Washington, LL Cool J, Michael Strahan, Morgan Freeman, Nikole Hannah-Jones, Paula Patton, Questlove, Samuel L Jackson, Simu Liu, Tiffany Haddish and Zendaya.",News/UK news,Harry and Meghan to receive civil rights award award from NAACP,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/26/prince-harry-meghan-markle-civil-rights-naacp
2/27/2022,"Even if you have no outdoor space, you can still grow a tasty, nourishing crop, albeit a mini one. Microgreens are seedlings of vegetables and herbs that are harvested (well, snipped with scissors) when their first leaves appear. They may be tiny, but their flavour is mighty. They also look pretty scattered over salads and soups. Most veg can be grown as microgreens; simply sprinkle seeds thickly on a seed tray filled with multi-purpose compost. Lightly sieve more compost over them to keep in place (a tea strainer tapped vigorously works well), then dampen the surface with a mister. Try beetroot, red cabbage and radish for vivid colour, and herbs like coriander and basil for big flavours. Otter Farm sells a mixed pack of microleaf seeds, which includes cress, chives, amaranth, rocket, leek and radish for £2. Aquascaping is the art of creating submerged landscapes in a tank. Fish are relegated to extras darting about among the ferns, mosses and pieces of twisted wood (known as hardscape). Enthusiasts take it to great lengths, recreating replicas of natural habitats – a riverbed in Borneo, say – which are called “biotopes”. Beginners can try a 30-litre Nano cube starter kit that includes an LED light, substrate layer and soil base (£114.99 Aquariumgardens.co.uk); plants, hardscape and fish are extra. The UK Aquatic Plant Society sells a variety of plants and kit. Aquascaping guru George Farmer has plenty of advice on his website and YouTube channel. For a mess-free way to grow veg indoors, hydroponics – growing in water, rather than soil – could be the answer. Many hydroponic kits, basically souped-up gardening trays with LED lamps and watering systems, are available and come in compact designs that suit modern kitchens. Plants are grown in an inert growing medium (one that contains no nutrients) and nutrients are delivered to the roots via fertiliser dissolved in water. Growth is boosted by artificial light, making the plant concentrate on growing leaves, rather than root systems. Leafy veg, such as lettuce and herbs, give the best results, although chillies and cherry tomatoes are worth a go. The Akarina 01 Starter Pack (£169.99) has an inbuilt light and timer and comes with seeds and liquid nutrients. It also looks pretty snazzy. The Bottle Farm Kit (£24.99) repurposes empty plastic bottles into mini gardens. It doesn’t have a light but comes with seeds, growing medium and suction pads to stick it on to the window. Once spurned as suburban, rockeries have made a welcome return to contemporary gardens. Miniature versions add alpine glamour to front gardens when positioned either directly on the soil or in a good-sized planter. A few stones or rocks (sourced locally or salvaged where possible), arranged in a container, make a naturalistic setting for pretty little plants. Put your chosen vessel on bricks (to allow drainage) in a sunny spot, then fill with peat-free, sandy compost. Position the stones, then plant in between before topping off with horticultural grit. Most garden centres have an alpine section where a huge variety of dainty delights await. Many alpines will attract butterflies, bees and other insects. The Alpine Society website has a list of specialist growers. A shady part of the front garden, below the canopy of a tree perhaps, is the ideal spot for a stumpery. You don’t need actual tree stumps (although they’re great if you can find some), a few logs of differing heights and widths will do the job. Bury them halfway into soil in an attractive grouping, firm the earth around them, top dress with wood chippings, then plant with shade-loving plants like ferns. (Fernatix has a good selection) You have now created a sanctuary for insects, reptiles and, hopefully, small mammals, including the hedgehog. As the logs settle and rot, moss and lichen and fungi will make an appearance and add to the mini forest-floor vibe. A hive buzzing with bees is a cheerful thing and need not be restricted to a rural setting: bees in urban gardens near pollen-rich flowers thrive. Maintaining a hive does take application, time and knowledge, however, so allowing an established beekeeper to set up their hives in your front garden could be the answer. First, see if your garden is suitable. Send a photo and description to the British Beekeepers Association. The beekeeper needs to be able to visit their hive at all times (an advantage of a front garden), and you must consider the sensitivities of neighbours and pedestrians passing by. (Bees will tolerate anyone within a few metres of the hive.) Plant flowers that attract honey bees – cosmos, verbena, lavender, borage and salvias are good ones to start with, try Higgledy Garden for seeds. Then a share of the joys of bee-keeping, and the honey, will be yours. A sunny balcony sheltered from wind can be a productive veg-growing patch. Remember to plant in a few good-sized containers, rather than lots of little pots that dry out quickly and lose nutrients: the RHS recommends a container at least 45cm deep and wide. Make sure the pots have drainage holes and fill with a good quality, peat-free, multi-purpose compost. Feed once or twice a week (a diluted tomato feed is fine), keep well-watered, then prepare to harvest. 1 Dwarf French bean “Traviata” (seeds, £2.45, chilternseeds.co.uk). Nice and upright, so perfect for containers. Produces loads of beans per plant. 2 Mentha requienii (9cm pot, £5.99, crocus.co.uk): this tiny-leaved, low-lying herb is loved by bees and has spikes of mauve flowers in autumn. 3 Rondo carrot (seeds, £1.99 per packet, Suttons.co.uk): a bite-sized carrot that thrives in containers filled with free-draining soil. 4 Tomato “Micro Cherry” (seeds, £4.95, sarahraven.com): tiny explosions of flavour that grow happily in pots in a sunny, sheltered spot. 5 Summer salad mix (€2.80, brownenvelopeseeds.com): lettuce, leaf beet, orache and quinoa in one seed packet. Also suits window boxes. 6 Lettuce “Little Leprechaun” (seeds, £1.20 per packet, tamarorganics.co.uk): small lettuce with crinkly red leaves and a firm heart. Jettison petunias and lobelia and plant hanging baskets with edibles instead. Then you can walk a few steps from the living room and pick fruit and veg dangling tantalisingly at nose height. Try blackberry “Black Cascade”, which is thornless and trails prettily (9cm plant £9.99, dobies.co.uk); strawberry “Toscana”, which also trails and has large pink flowers pre-fruiting (five plug plants, £6.99, brooksidenursery.co.uk); or tomato “Hundreds and Thousands”, which produces masses of cascading cherry tomatoes (10 seeds, £2.55, prettywildseeds.co.uk). Herbs also thrive in hanging baskets: three in one basket – parsley, sage, thyme, for example – will be productive, attractive and a stuffing mix in waiting. Line the basket with sodden moss or a coconut liner, fill with nutrient-rich, peat-free compost, like Melcourt’s SylvaGrow (3x15-litre bags, £20.97, crocus.co.uk), plant it and keep well-watered and fed. This is essential as hanging baskets dry out quickly and nutrients drain away during watering. Don’t neglect the balcony walls. Think vertically and fix a trellis, then plant veg that need support and height and are pleasing to look at. Pea “Blauwshokker” has pretty pink flowers followed by striking purple pods (£2.50 for a packet of seeds, sarahraven.com), and Ushiki Kuri squash produces small orange orbs in autumn (€2.80, brownenvelopeseeds.com). Alternatively,invest in a vertical planting kit and plant lettuce, herbs and cherry tomatoes in its pockets. Wonderwall (crocus.co.uk, £56.99) has a self-watering irrigation system that keeps plants going for two weeks. If you have any outdoor space at all, you can grow fruit trees. All you need is a good-sized container, compost and the right plants. It is said that five trees make an orchard, but a couple is all it takes to deliver blossom in spring and abundant fruit in autumn. When choosing apples, look for self-pollinating varieties grown on dwarfing or semi-dwarfing rootstock (otterfarm.co.uk has a good selection of semi-dwarfing varieties). Dwarfing rootstocks (on to which trees are grafted) reduces the size of the plants, which are often listed as patio trees. Small varieties to look out for include Red Falstaff, Greensleeves and Saturn (chrisbowers.co.uk has all three). To plant, soak the rootball for at least 10 minutes then dig a hole twice the size of the rootball. Plant the tree, making sure the graft (where the trunk bulges) is above the surface of the soil, backfill and water well. You don’t need to restrict your orchard to apples. Other to try are pears and quinces, plums and damsons, peaches, nectarines and apricots, all of which have varieties grown on dwarf or semi-dwarf rootstock which grow well in containers. Small gardens tend to be flat, with any height introduced by plants or a sapling. Thinking in three-dimensions instead, and sculpting the surface with a mound or two, adds a whole new level of interest. Heap up a pile of topsoil or earth from the garden (you could make a small pond in the process) into a pleasing hump, then cover it with wildflower turf. This can be bought by the metre and comes ready studded with native plants, such as red clover, scabious and ox-eye daisies (£23.10 per metre, thelawnstore.co.uk). Rake the soil removing any stones, tread over the surface to firm, then roll out the turf. It’s an easy, cheat’s way to create a mini flower meadow. You could, of course, sow wildflower seeds for a more economical route to the same effect. Visit plantlife.org.uk for instructions and seeds.

2/27/2022,"Peaky Blinders is back and, with it, the largest number of Brummie and Brummie-ish accents you’re likely to hear on TV all year, at least until MasterChef makes its recently announced move to Birmingham and Gregg Wallace is forced to start calling everyone “bab”. In the Radio Times last week, Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight had a chat with Adrian Chiles about how the series has revived a sense of mythology around the city. “I did think very consciously that what we don’t do in Birmingham – and, in fact, in England as a whole – is mythologise our own environment and be bold about it,” Knight said. It’s certainly true that Peaky Blinders has created a whole mythological industry around it. I’ve written before about the proliferation of Peaky Blinders-themed pub crawls, how you’d be hard pressed to go out in the West Midlands (and beyond) on a Saturday night without seeing at least one flat cap and a waistcoat. Last year, I test-drove a car around a village that the garage owner swore had been a Peaky Blinders filming location and though nothing on Google or, for that matter, on screen could confirm his story, that sense of local pride was palpable. Knight mentioned “a sort of cultural cringe”, pointing out that Americans write songs about almost all of their cities, while we seem a bit embarrassed about some of ours. Cultural cringe was coined by the academic AA Phillips in 1950, who used it to describe an Australian sense of inferiority about the country’s culture. In the UK, there are plenty of cities without an inferiority complex. The cultural giants such as Manchester and Liverpool are happy to celebrate their histories and you can’t turn on the telly at the moment without getting stuck in the six-hour vortex of an edgy drama set in Bristol. But the attention is lopsided. I say this as someone who comes from Lincolnshire, largely celebrated for being flat, and I can’t think of many songs or TV series that mythologise that. Tinie Tempah mentioned Scunthorpe in a song, but only to say he’d never been there. British humour is largely based on taking the piss, specifically out of ourselves, and I suppose that makes it harder to celebrate much of anything. But British cities are bursting with character and it is a shame to limit stories to the usual ones. Where are the Lichfield romcoms? Why aren’t there more thrillers set in Hull? Knight has proved that we only have to make an effort to instil a bit of local pride and more of it will follow. After seven years and two victories, Oti Mabuse has announced her departure from Strictly Come Dancing. “She leaves a dazzling legacy behind her, as the only professional dancer to lift the glitterball trophy in two consecutive years,” ran the BBC’s official statement, which was sweet, even if it read a bit like an obituary. The ever-popular Mabuse managed to win across the talent divide, securing victories as partner to both Kelvin Fletcher and Bill Bailey; her range is unparalleled and it doesn’t feel like it will be quite the same show without her. Yet for a while now, Mabuse has been more famous, arguably, than half of the celebrity contestants who do Strictly. She is all over TV, on every channel, presenting, guesting, doing Tipping Point. At the start of a new series, differentiating between pro dancer and famous person is never the easiest of tasks, and sometimes it can feel like the toss of a coin. (If there’s a mention of either TikTok or the word “YouTuber”, I know I’m in trouble.) Watching her team up with someone who once appeared in Hollyoaks in 2009 would feel strange now. She will be missed, but surely it’s time for her next step. Viewers who caught the jawdropping Netflix documentary The Tinder Swindler will be familiar with Simon Leviev, whose real name is Shimon Hayut, a man alleged by the film to have pulled off a whopping con that parted several women from an awful lot of money. According to the documentary, he claimed to be the billionaire son of a diamond dealer, wooed women he met on the dating app by flying them around Europe, told them he and his bodyguard, Peter, were under attack, then asked them to send him tens of thousands of dollars. What’s amazing – and tragic and heartbreaking – is that they did. As the story indicates, we are living through an age that has a complicated relationship with the concept of shame. Leviev, meanwhile, has turned himself into a celebrity. It was wearyingly inevitable. An American talent agency has signed him up. His website flogs T-shirts with “catchphrases” from the film, charmingly reviving his panicked message, “Peter’s hurt, send money”, by emblazoning it on the chest; you can add a personalised video for $200. I wonder if he’d do an impression of the women who thought they loved him sobbing at the mountain of debt they racked up so he could have a lavish holiday in Mykonos with a new girlfriend. In his first interview since the film, he denies being a conman as alleged – the two years in prison in Finland for fraud must have been an anomaly – but then again, he is selling NFTs (non-fungible tokens), which does seem like a reliable indicator of character. The women who spoke on the documentary about their experiences, meanwhile, have been trolled.

2/27/2022,"Dave Grohl was born in Ohio in 1969 and raised in Virginia. He got his start as a drummer with the punk band Scream before joining Nirvana in 1990. Following the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, Grohl formed Foo Fighters, who released their 10th album last year. He has directed several documentaries, and last year published an autobiography, The Storyteller. His latest project, in which he stars with his band, is the horror-comedy film Studio 666, on general release now. Grohl lives with his wife and three daughters in Los Angeles. Wet Leg This [Isle of Wight] band is starting to blow up in America. A friend forwarded me their song Chaise Longue and I thought, Oh this is great. It’s fun, it’s fresh, it’s new, it’s just completely entertaining. Great sense of humour, great beat, great riffs, totally hooky. I started forwarding it to my friends, and whenever we get together for our living room dance parties, that’s the one song everyone jumps off the couch and dances to. There are nights when we just play that song on repeat. They make brilliant videos too. I can’t wait to see them live. Hot Ones (YouTube) This series, hosted by Sean Evans, is one of the greatest ideas for a [celebrity] interview show: 10 chicken wings with 10 increasingly hot sauces, and each wing accompanies a question. Watching your favourite celebrity try to choke down hot sauce with a Scoville count of 1.5 million is amazing. Gordon Ramsay was my favourite episode, because you’ve never seen the guy get it back so hard, after all the pain he’s given out. The person who survived without a scratch, and almost looked like she was enjoying it, was Lorde. Take her for a curry. It’ll blow your mind. The Lyrics by Paul McCartney (Allen Lane) I’m familiar with every one of Paul McCartney’s songs, and I could probably recite most of them off the top of my head, but to have this new perspective coming from the writer, explaining the songs himself, is really rewarding. It humanises the whole process. I did love the [Beatles] documentary Get Back too. I watched Ringo the entire time: I know what it’s like to sit on a drum stool and watch a bunch of people argue. All you want to do is play a beat. Come on, fuck it, no more words! American barbecue The resurgence of American barbecue in the past few years is exciting for me, because I grew up in Virginia where barbecue was everywhere. Nowadays, you’ve got chefs getting into the molecular science of a brisket, but you should never forget that it’s a very simple food that’s meant to feed a large amount of people at one time. My favourite barbecue chef is Sam Jones in North Carolina, who still cooks on a pit that his great-grandfather cooked on 130 years ago. It’s so simple, but it is without question the most delicious thing ever. Euphoria (HBO/Sky Atlantic) I don’t watch much TV, but Euphoria has completely blown my mind, and I think Zendaya is one of the greatest actresses to come out of American television in the past 30 years. It’s about a group of young friends navigating a difficult life that becomes a hurricane of drugs and sex and family issues. I watched an episode the other night that had to do with addiction and withdrawal, and it was so on the fucking nose that I was traumatised after watching it. But then you start to fall in love with the characters and, oof, it’s good. NFTs I love the idea of an NFT [non-fungible token], though I don’t completely understand it. I just figure that whatever I create eventually belongs to everyone. But if you can make $10m off of a fucking drawing, then I’ll make them all day long. There’s one in my studio right now. Someone gave us an NFT. It’s this thing in a frame and you plug it in and then it’s an image. It’s just colours.

2/27/2022,"Peter Dinklage is the latest actor to take on the rather thankless role of Cyrano de Bergerac (others include José Ferrer, Gérard Depardieu and Steve Martin), the poet, swordsman and wit so insecure in his looks that he uses a handsome thicko as a kind of human sock puppet to woo the love of his life, Roxanne (an apple-cheeked and appealing Haley Bennett). Dinklage is a world-class acting talent who is more than able to hold his own against the rather overegged directing style of Joe Wright, who never saw a frame he didn’t want to fill with jostling extras and livestock. But even Dinklage struggles with Cyrano’s musical component, a selection of shapeless, virtually tuneless songs. The best thing about the original compositions is that they are at least easily forgettable. Meanwhile, the screenplay embraces the wallowing tragedy of the story, but is less successful at conveying Cyrano’s parrying humour. It’s as though an essential part of the character’s appeal is missing; the knock-on effect is that the film’s glorious scenery and Sicilian backdrop end up doing rather a lot of heavy lifting.",Arts/Film,Cyrano review – Peter Dinklage woos to no avail in Joe Wright’s musical romance,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/26/cyrano-review-peter-dinklage-woos-to-no-avail-in-joe-wrights-musical-romance
2/27/2022,"The weather was a trifle chillier than Antonio Conte might have wanted but, in so many ways, this trip to West Yorkshire proved every bit as restorative as a week in the sun at the Tottenham manager’s favourite resort hotel in Sardinia. All those not so veiled threats about walking out on Spurs after losing at Burnley last Wednesday were forgotten as, with Harry Kane and Ryan Sessegnon excelling, Conte’s team repeatedly cantered through Marcelo Bielsa side’s defence, reviving their, albeit still slender, hopes of Champions League qualification along the way. For Leeds the statistics are damning. Despite possessing one of the Premier League’s most admired goalkeepers, Leeds have conceded 60 league goals this season, more than anyone else and have collected only one point from the last possible 18. Given Conte’s left wing-back was enjoying such a fine game for Spurs it was perhaps appropriate that it was Sessegnon’s cross which created the opening goal for the onrushing Matt Doherty. The right wing-back took that delivery seamlessly in his stride, lifting a first time shot over Illan Meslier. Bielsa’s goalkeeper was soon beaten again. This time the danger derived from the right where Conte’s Juventus loanee winger, Dejan Kulusevski, assumed possession. He played a slick one-two with Doherty, cut inside and, having dodged Junior Firpo with almost contemptuous erase, deceived Meslier by fixing his eyes on the far corner. No prizes for guess Kulusevski then proceeded to squeeze a left-foot shot just inside the near post. After a few moments of introspection starting bleakly at the ground beneath his feet, Bielsa switched from a back four to a back three, with Stuart Dallas reassigned to right wing-back with the fairly thankless of minding Sessegnon. Briefly, Leeds improved and when Raphinha and Robin Koch exchanged passes, Koch was unlucky to see his eventual shot rebound off the inside of a post with Hugo Lloris beaten. It proved a purely temporary respite for Bielsa. When Pierre-Emile Højbjerg lifted a pass into the area, Kane lost Diego Llorente and used his left foot to volley the dropping ball beyond Meslier from a particularly awkward angle. The exquisiteness of Kane’s finish on a day when the England striker was fully back to his best proved no consolation to Elland Road regulars who must have been tempted to start watching through their fingers every time Spurs crossed the halfway line. On Friday Bielsa pledged that his attacking philosophy remained “the only path” for Leeds but his team has conceded at least three goals in each of its five games since Newcastle secured a modest 1-0 win here on January 22. Given that Leeds shipped six goal at Liverpool on Wednesday they trudged off at half-time here against a soundtrack best described as somewhere between mutterings of discontent and gentle booing. Although, shortly before the break, Meslier saved well from Sessegnon after the wing-back was cleverly cued up by Kane, it was not quite as one-sided as the scoreline suggested. Indeed Spurs were forced to weather a few periods of intensive Leeds pressing and, despite Raphinha’s usually reliable radar appearing to have gone a little awry – and Leeds fans can only hope he has not fallen out with Bielsa – an unmarked Luke Ayling directed a very decent headed chance off target. There is though no point in, a la Leeds, commanding around 60% of possession if your defending is consistently disastrous. Despite the introduction of Mateusz Klich and Rodrigo little of substance changed for Leeds with Meslier continuing to make a series of good saves. Meanwhile Conte was yellow carded for protesting too vigorously after Rodrigo caught Cristian Romero painfully on a calf. Scowls subsequently turned to smiles on the visiting bench as Kane crowned an afternoon punctuated by some glorious passing, often from defender-disorientating deep positions, provided Son Heung-min with a stellar diagonal delivery and, having taken a steadying touch, Son shot Tottenham’s fourth. It proved the cue for many of those who had earlier been, somewhat defiantly, signing “marching on together” to march out of Elland Road in a despairing exodus. Those who remained booed Bielsa’s side off.",Sport/Football,Kane and Son seal Tottenham’s romp to leave Leeds and Bielsa in trouble,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/26/leeds-tottenham-premier-league-match-report
2/27/2022,"Oh!” said Emily Maitlis’s jumper. You have a feeling that the producers of Newsnight might be saying something stronger. Last Tuesday a photo showed the jumpered-and-jeaned Newsnight lead presenter Maitlis alongside her fellow Americast host, BBC North American expert Jon Sopel (suit, no tie), in a radio studio. Nothing unusual there… except that behind them was a Global logo, instead of a BBC one. That was a surprise. And the tweet that accompanied the picture, announcing that Maitlis and Sopel are joining Global to host a new podcast and a show on LBC? Well, that was a complete shock. Not just to the public, but to BBC management. “Everyone was completely blindsided,” says a BBC source. “It’s a massive blow.” It is. Both Sopel and Maitlis are BBC “big beasts”: high profile, highly experienced, strong personality-ed political journalists. Maitlis, best known for presenting the BBC’s flagship news analysis show, Newsnight, has been a star for a while, but she became even more so when she pulled in the “no sweat” 2019 interview with Prince Andrew. Sopel was the BBC’s well-respected North American editor for eight years, and considered to be one of the frontrunners for the BBC political editor job when Laura Kuenssberg steps down in April. Both had established a strong following for their Americast podcast, launched to cover the last US elections and continued afterwards, due to its popularity. Maitlis’s departure leaves Newsnight needing a presenter, as well as a programme editor, since Esme Wren has left to become the editor of Channel 4 News. Within the BBC, it had been noticed that Maitlis was taking an oddly timed sabbatical for a few months: perhaps, some thought, she was planning to move to Channel 4 News herself, to take up Jon Snow’s old position? But instead she and Sopel (who’d also taken a step back from the BBC, supposedly to write a book) have followed Andrew Marr, who will start a 6-7pm Monday to Thursday show on LBC from 7 March. Before Marr, there was Eddie Mair (ex-presenter of Radio 4’s PM, moved in 2018) and Shelagh Fogerty (ex-Radio 5Live, joined 2014), who both have daily shows on LBC. Not to mention John Humphrys and Moira Stewart, ex-Radio 4 and ex-Radio 2, who host on Global-owned Classic FM. If you’re not an LBC listener, you might wonder why such big names are making the move. There’s a sense, among those who don’t listen to it, that LBC is a bit low rent, with shows hosted by kneejerk controversialists who say whatever they like to get headlines. Isn’t LBC where Nigel Farage had a show? And Katie Hopkins? Wasn’t one of their hosts sacked recently? Well: yes, yes and yes (all were sacked: Maajid Nawaz, earlier this year, because of his anti-vax stance) – but LBC has been on the up for a while. Once a local London station known for its feisty phone-ins, it’s been national since 2019. Brexit was a turning point, in terms of listeners (they rose to 1.6million in 2016: since then, the number has doubled), but James O’Brien, who hosts the most popular show on the station, mid-mornings during the week, says the appeal of LBC, to hosts and listeners, is more than that. “You could hang it on Brexit,” he says, “but really it’s because LBC gives people the freedom to explore ideas and express opinions. It has a different sort of journalist than a few years ago because the fact is the world has changed – look at Brexit, Trump, Johnson – and the current model of impartiality at the BBC doesn’t work. You want to be able to call somebody a liar if they’re lying. You don’t want to have to put another side of climate science when there isn’t one. At LBC, you’re allowed to say the world’s gone mad. You can’t do that on the BBC.” Against that background, there are a few other reasons for Maitlis and Sopel making their moves – and not all of them are monetary, though Global has deep pockets and is perfectly capable of doubling the rate that they received from the Beeb. Ambition is one. Global has big ideas, and it wants success: before the pandemic, managers would host an all-company meeting in a cinema to discuss Rajar [listening figure]results, highlighting achievements as well as shows not performing well. In contrast, some flagship BBC radio programme hosts aren’t even given their Rajar results, presumably because they make no difference as the show will never disappear. Plus there is talk of LBC moving into TV: it already live streams every show, and show clips regularly go viral on social media. Resources is another: the BBC has been cutting costs for a while, and its restructuring and the relocation of many teams has meant that several experienced producers have left. It used to be the case that commercial radio shows would run on a presenter and a single producer manning the phones, and that can still happen. But big names like Marr, Maitlis and Sopel are bringing their own producers and will have other support. Another, subtler, reason is tone. Since Twitter, where anyone can express themselves without gatekeepers, BBC radio – especially Radio 4 – can sound a little cold. Clearly, it offers excellent reporting from respectedexperts. But it can seem top-down, even patronising, to listeners more used to being able to contribute. The Today programme does not feature listeners. In fact, Radio 4, filled as it is with “built” (pre-made) programmes, doesn’t have much space for listeners generally, though Woman’s Hour and You and Yours host phone-ins. On LBC, the lines are open all day. Last Thursday O’Brien’s show got a phone call from a political scientist working at King’s College London – the type of expert that Radio 4 would book on the Today programme. On LBC, he just called into the show. But O’Brien is right in that the biggest pull-factor for these clever journalists is freedom. Tim Davie, the BBC’s director general, has been enforcing stringent no-bias rules on its presenters, preventing them from expressing personal opinions on social media and in public. Maitlis has been reprimanded for breaking these impartiality rules: first, for her searing opener about Dominic Cummings’ lockdown jaunt to Durham; more recently for retweeting Piers Morgan. Andrew Marr has indicated that he wants to be able to express his opinions (especially around climate change), and in his first blog post for LBC, seemed to reiterate this. “This has,” he wrote, “sadly, been an age of political lies, and now of war propaganda. Never has plain-speaking clear, cut to the chase reporting… been more important.” As it happens, James O’Brien was once offered a chance to host Newsnight. He loved the experience of presenting – “it’s like driving a Formula 1 car, one of the greatest pleasures in journalism” – but did not enjoy the management. “They’re like Formula 1 owners, who you expect to have your back, but don’t because they’re living in fear of what the Daily Mail might say.” He says: “I was told off for calling Toby Young a twat on Twitter. And I thought: do I really want to be in a position where I can’t call Toby Young a twat?” He’s sort of joking, but only sort of. When he was thinking about joining Newsnight – coming off social media, keeping his head down - he was advised, by a couple of very experienced journalists, to “keep your own voice. And on LBC, I have my own voice”. One final factor: podcasts. Though the BBC is great for drama, true crime and chat podcasts, its news podcasts have perhaps been underestimated. Their relaxed, intimate tone is a relief for journalists and listeners alike. LBC has yet to announce exactly what Maitlis and Sopel will be doing, but Americast is owned by the BBC, so they can’t bring that with them. However, there’s no reason why they can’t make a similar podcast for Global, especially as they’ve brought Americast producer Dino Sofos along too. When it comes to radio, you can see them taking a double-headed Friday night slot, or perhaps a weekend afternoon. Back at the BBC, the feeling is that it might not be so bad that Sopel has gone: as a middle-aged, middle-class white man, it could have looked off if he were appointed as the new political editor. But Maitlis is acknowledged as a big loss, and news in general is having a tough time. Newsnight needs a lead presenter. Laura Kuenssberg’s job is open – the first interviews were held last week – and, aside from Sopel, many others have ruled themselves out of that job, too. There aren’t that many medium-sized beasts left, let alone big ones. And they can’t give every job to Amol Rajan.",News/Media,What’s next for BBC news?
