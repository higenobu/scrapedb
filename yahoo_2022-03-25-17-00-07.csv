3/25/2022,"A Florida woman was fired from her job as a bridge tender after authorities deemed her criminally responsible for the February death of a 79-year-old woman. Her supervisor, who happened to be her boyfriend’s mother, was also relieved of her position on Tuesday, March 22, because both women violated the company’s safe operations procedures. After being arrested and charged with one count of manslaughter by culpable negligence in the death of Carol Wright on Thursday, March 17, Artissua Lafay Paulk, 43, received a written statement from her employers letting her know she was no longer employed by Florida Drawbridges, Inc. Officials have gathered evidence pointing to Paulk being responsible for the drawbridge unexpectedly rising on Sunday, Feb. 6, which caused Wright to fall from the Royal Park Bridge in West Park Beach to her death. An investigation completed by the West Palm Beach Police department, FOX 13 reports, discovered Paulk lied to police initially about the circumstances surrounding Wright’s death, locating surveillance video and deleted text messages between the woman and her supervisor Kathy Harper regarding how to cover up her role in the senior citizen’s untimely demise. Wright’s family has secured legal representation to seek justice for the deceased grandmother, who died one year shy of being an octogenarian. Attorney Lance Ivey names Paulk as the sole person culpable for Wright’s death. He says the woman made a trip to a Palm Beach bookstore and upon her return, decided she would take the bridge back to her home. “She legally and lawfully gets on the bridge. And without any expectation, unbeknownst to her, the bridge tender pushes the button that would ultimately turn out to be a slow, mental, and physical death sentence for Carol.” When Paulk allegedly pressed the button for the drawbridge to go up, Wright was already 10 feet from the barrier arms, a police report states, and she was unable to make a successful retreat. West Palm Beach police spokesman Mike Jachles explained to the Palm Beach Post, she was walking her bike from east to west and had almost reached the furthest point of the moveable span when it went up.” He later said, “The woman tried to hang on. There was a bystander nearby who tried to help her, but tragically she fell five or six stories below where she died landing on concrete. “Despite those efforts, the woman was not able to hold on and she fell to the concrete landing below to her death,” Jachles said. “From where the victim was to where she landed was approximately five to six stories or 50 to 60 feet.” The incident happened around 1 p.m. and Fire Rescue’s Technical Rescue Team closed down the bridge for almost six hours as rescue professionals retrieved Wright’s body. As the team worked to find the woman’s remains, the two women were sending text messages to each other about how to frame Paulk’s hand in the incident. An affidavit prepared by detectives noted Harper told Paulk in the texts to lie during her interview with law enforcement about checking the bridge house balcony for pedestrians. When Paulk was interviewed, she did as she was instructed by her boyfriend’s mother and lied to officers. She fabricated a story saying she walked onto the balcony to do a visual check of the bridge. The woman said she checked for vehicles or pedestrians before she opened the bridge. The police took her statement and described her disposition as “distraught” during the questioning. “That bridge tender has certain safety protocols to follow, specific safety protocols,” Jachles explained, showing how much responsibility the woman had in her job capacity. “That includes lowering of the gates for the vehicles, lowering of the gates for the pedestrians, and making several visual confirmations that there is nobody at either of the spans or past those gates.” Jachles said footage viewed by officers did not reconcile with Paulk’s initial statement and made them question her story. “There are a number of different camera angles from different sources that were taken into account for evidence and reviewed to corroborate the witnesses’ statements,” he said. Paulk did not hand over her cell phone to the investigators until two weeks after Wright’s death. This is when the officers discovered the plan to cover up Paulk’s role in the incident. Here are the messages law enforcement was able to retrieve from the phone, despite Paulk trying to delete them, and submitted in the arrest affidavit in Palm Beach County court records. “3:20 p.m. from supervisor to Paulk: When they talk to you make [expletive] sure you tell them you walked outside on balcony 3 diff times to make sure no one was past gates n delete this msg after one time to make sure card [sic] stop 2nd time after gates lowered and 3rd time before you raised spans ok now delete this I know ur upset but u gotta tell them step by step how u do opening” – this message was deleted“ “3:20 p.m. Paulk to supervisor: “I did” – this message was deleted“ “3:59 p.m. from supervisor to Paulk: “You have to write out step by step what you did ok up till time you were told someone fell” – this message was deleted“ Between the messages to Harper, at 3:44 p.m., Paulk sent correspondence to a friend confessing to the crime, “I’m here with the police I killed a lady on the bridge.” Upon reviewing the affidavit findings and the arrest, Florida Drawbridges, Inc. decided to fire both women. Paulk worked for the company for one year, spending only two months on the bridge assignment. No charges have been announced for her supervisor. Should Paulk be convicted of the crime, she faces a maximum of 15 years in prison.",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,Florida Bridge Tender Is Arrested and Fired from Her Job After Police Discovered She Lied About Her Role In the Death of a Grandmother Crossing Bridge,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-bridge-tender-arrested-fired-230300413.html
3/25/2022,"By Sarah N. Lynch and Raphael Satter WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. and British officials on Thursday accused the Russian government of running a years-long campaign to hack into critical infrastructure, including an American nuclear plant and a Saudi oil refinery. The announcement was paired with the unsealing of criminal charges against four Russian government officials, whom the U.S. Department of Justice accused of carrying out two major hacking operations aimed at the global energy sector. Thousands of computers in 135 countries were affected between 2012 and 2018, U.S. prosecutors said. Cyber security analysts described the moves as a shot across the bow to Moscow after U.S. President Joe Biden warned just days ago about ""evolving intelligence"" that the Russian government may be preparing cyberattacks against American targets. John Hultquist, whose firm Mandiant investigated the Saudi refinery hack, said that by making the criminal charges public the United States has ""let them know that we know who they are."" In one of the two indictments unsealed on Thursday and dated June 2021, the Justice Department accused Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh, a 36-year-old Russian ministry of defense research institute employee, of conspiring with others between May and September 2017 to hack the systems of a foreign refinery and install malware known as ""Triton"" on a safety system produced by Schneider Electric. The refinery wasn't named, but the British government said it was in Saudi Arabia and it has previously been identified as the Petro Rabigh refinery complex on the Red Sea coast. In a second indictment, dated August 2021, the Justice Department said three other suspected hackers from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) carried out cyberattacks on the computer networks of oil and gas firms, nuclear power plants, and utility and power transmission companies between 2012 and 2017 - a campaign researchers have long attributed to a group sometimes dubbed ""Energetic Bear"" or ""Berserk Bear."" The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a message seeking comment. The three accused Russians in the second case are Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov, 36, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, 42, and Marat Valeryevich Tyukov, 39. None of the four defendants have been arrested, a U.S. official said. Britain's Foreign Office said that the FSB hackers targeted the systems controlling the Wolf Creek nuclear plant in Kansas ""but failed to have any negative impact."" ""Russia's targeting of critical national infrastructure is calculated and dangerous,"" UK foreign secretary Liz Truss said in a statement. She said it showed Russian President Vladimir Putin ""is prepared to risk lives to sow division and confusion among allies."" A Justice Department official told reporters that even though the hacking at issue in the two cases occurred years ago, investigators remained concerned Russia will carry out similar attacks in future. ""These charges show the dark art of the possible when it comes to critical infrastructure,"" the official said. The official added that the department decided to unseal the indictments because they determined the ""benefit of revealing the results of the investigation now outweighs the likelihood of arrests in the future."" The 2017 Saudi refinery attack stunned the cybersecurity community when it was made public by researchers later that year because - unlike typical digital intrusions aimed at stealing data or holding it for ransom - it appeared aimed at causing physical damage to the facility itself by disabling its safety system. U.S. officials have been tracking the case ever since. In 2019, those behind Triton were reported to be scanning and probing at least 20 electric utilities in the United States for vulnerabilities. Two weeks before the 2020 U.S. presidential election the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the Russian government-backed Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics. Prosecutors believe Gladkikh worked there. On Thursday, British officials also announced sanctions on the institute. The Foreign Office said FSB hackers had targeted British energy companies and successfully stolen data from the U.S. aviation sector. It also accused the hackers of trying to compromise an employee of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon who fell afoul of the Kremlin and now lives in London. (Reporting by Sarah N.

3/25/2022,"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) was ripped for missing out some crucial context as he tried to attack his one-time good friend President Joe Biden on Thursday. Biden, speaking at an emergency summit of NATO leaders to tackle Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, explained how he’d been inspired to run for the White House following former President Donald Trump’s “both sides” comment after the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Graham fired back on Twitter: “As Ukraine burns, President Biden is talking about Charlottesville and domestic politics. Very sad.” Critics pointed out how Biden was only responding to a journalist’s question on concerns in Europe the coordinated response against Russia could be undone if Trump won the 2024 election. Others pointed out Graham’s own wild tangents and Trump’s habit of turning every press conference into a diatribe against his enemies.

Scientists have been hunting for a way to stop humans from aging for decades. Some scientists think that we’ll never reverse aging. Others say we’ll have a way to prevent aging in the next 20 years. Such a claim might seem bold, but a new anti-aging supplement shows that we may be closer than you think.

Amazon's Fire TV deals start at just $19.99 this week Dr. Rajagopal Viswanath Sekhar, an associate professor of medicine-endocrinology at Baylor College of Medicine, says that mitochondria can play a vital role in slowing down aging. Dr. Sekhar is a senior author on a new study surrounding an anti-aging supplement that extended the life span of mice by 24 percent. Dr. Sekhar says that there are two fundamental defects that contribute to aging. The first is a dysfunction of our bodies’ mitochondrial. The second is an increase in oxidative stress. This increased stress causes harm to our body’s mitochondrial and even other components of our cells. (via Medical News Today) The anti-aging supplement that Dr. Sekhar and his colleagues tested helps mitigate these issues by correcting a decrease in glutathione. Glutathione is a natural antioxidant found in cells. This antioxidant is extremely vital in protecting our bodies from oxidative stress, as well as protection from mercury and other toxic metals. The levels of glutathione in our bodies decrease as we age. When that happens, our bodies experience more oxidative stress, and our mitochondrial start to function less efficiently. It can also lead to loss of muscle strength, defects in our metabolism, and more. Each of these issues is considered an important marker of our body’s aging. So, as we age, our body becomes less efficient at making the critical resources it needs to survive. When that happens, our body begins to experience side effects that have become common signs of aging. But what if we could keep our bodies making those resources just as well when we age? That’s the idea behind this new study. Dr. Sekhar and his colleagues found that using a supplement called GlyNAC, they were able to increase the life span of mice by correcting their glutathione deficiency. This also helped reduce oxidate stress and the dysfunction of the critically important mitochondrial. At its core, GlyNAC is a mixture of glycine, an amino acid, and the medicine N-acetylcysteine (or NAC). When put together the two compounds act as precursors to glutathione. This allowed the scientists to stabilize the correct levels of glutathione in the mice that they tested. Which, has led them to believe this may be a tangible anti-aging supplement. But, there’s still a long way to go. While Dr. Sekhar and his team have conducted some limited trials with the anti-aging supplement. Overall, he said they saw some promising results. But, there’s still a lot of testing that needs to be done before GlyNAC can properly be petitioned as an answer to slowing aging in humans. Click here to read the full article.
