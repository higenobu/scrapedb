2/26/2022,"Sanctions against Russia may not achieve their aim of forcing Vladimir Putin back to the negotiating table if his forces succeed in achieving their military objective before the country feels the economic pain. Russia may be enfeebled by years of dependence on commodity exports, yet the Kremlin has fattened itself on the proceeds of last year’s inflationary boom in energy prices. That means it’s now in a prime position to weather reprisals designed to sap his fiscal ability to wage war. “We will weaken Russia’s economic base and its capacity to modernize, and in addition we will freeze Russian assets in the European Union,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned on Thursday only hours after Putin launched combat operations. Waves of increasingly punishing financial sanctions imposed by Western allies may ultimately take too much time to unfold their full effect—valuable time Ukraine may not have. “President Putin’s decision to escalate the military confrontation into a war suggests a willingness to accept near-term economic pain in favor of securing long-term geopolitical goals,” wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of global wealth management at UBS on Thursday. At first glance, Russia seems like an easy sanctions target given its calcified and uncompetitive economy that lives off exports harvested from the fields or mined out of the ground. Wealth inequality creates deep fissures in its society, vaccination hesitancy is rampant, and life expectancy at birth ranks just 159th in the world. “Russia continues to face relatively low potential growth, which, unless addressed, will impede the ability of the country to achieve high development goals, raising incomes and living standards,” wrote the World Bank in its latest country report published in December. Michael Hüther, director of the economic think tank IW in Cologne, Germany, argued the manufactured crisis in Ukraine offered Putin the chance to deflect from domestic problems such as its glacial pace of innovation and reliance on foreign imports of electronics, machinery, and other durable goods. “The path towards commercial independence from commodity exports is a very long one,” he wrote in an op-ed on Wednesday. “Russia is economically far weaker than it itself feels politically and projects militarily.” But despite its antiquated industry and dilapidated infrastructure, Russia may be better prepared than ever to weather the sanctions, crippling as they might be. First off, the country enjoys vast resources at its disposal, making it the world’s largest exporter of natural gas and wheat. And it’s likely no coincidence that the military offensive in Ukraine coincides with historically high energy prices, which have filled Russia’s coffers over previous months and given it an economic cushion. While many developed nations remain addicted to foreign capital to finance their consumption, Russia has proved it is more than capable of living within its means. At $82 billion in September, Russia’s current account surplus reached its highest since the global financial crisis, and its fiscal debt sits at just 16% of GDP, paltry compared with the euro area’s 98% figure at the end of the third quarter. Meanwhile, Russia continued last year to decouple itself financially from the global reserve currency system by accumulating more gold in its central bank vaults than it holds in U.S. dollars. According to the World Gold Council, stores of nearly 2,300 metric tons at the end of November are the fifth largest in the world after the U.S., Germany, Italy, and France. Putin’s Central Bank of Russia (CBR) also said it was “ready to take all necessary measures to maintain financial stability,” announcing forbearance measures on key balance sheet solvency metrics lasting until October to prop up any credit institutions that may see access to capital via interbank lending markets severed. According to UBS estimates, the CBR also holds some $640 billion in foreign exchange reserves, and could afford to pause further interventions to prop up the ruble. Furthermore Russia’s sovereign debt is largely impervious to attack from bond market vigilantes thanks to the share of foreign creditors falling below 20%. Finally the government always has the option to release some of its funds tied up in the National Welfare Fund, which bunkers proceeds from its petroleum industry for a rainy day. Its liquid assets alone equate to no less than 7% of the country’s gross domestic product. This puts the Kremlin in an enviable position compared with 2014 during its first land grab when it captured Crimea, Ukraine’s pro-Russian enclave on the Black Sea. That isn’t to say the icy frost of sanctions won’t put the chill on Russian risk assets. The MOEX benchmark tracking the country’s blue chips had already suffered heavy losses this week before halving in value on Thursday to plumb depths not seen since the start of 2016. With stock market prices plunging, Bloomberg reported sources as saying Putin has called major shareholders and the leaders of Russia’s biggest companies to the Kremlin to discuss the situation in Ukraine. Michael Roth, head of the German parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said the best hope for causing pain to Putin will not be making life miserable for the average Russian on the street. Instead the West needed to expand their campaign against the wealthy benefactors of Putin’s economic system, only a handful of which have been singled out thus far. Prominent individuals like Roman Abramovich have escaped sanctions, and one even enjoys a cushy lifetime appointment to the U.K.’s House of Lords. “Our sanctions must above all target Putin’s system of oligarchy,” said Roth. “We have to drain the resources from all those millionaires and billionaires that enriched themselves in his shadow and now enjoy privileges like sending their kids to schools in the West, buying luxury flats in Berlin and London, and going on ski holidays to Austria.” Maybe then Putin can be forced back to the negotiating table.

2/26/2022,"(Bloomberg) — Russia’s wealthiest individuals were already feeling the squeeze from escalating tensions between the nation and Ukraine. Most Read from Bloomberg Taiwan to Join in U.S.-Led Sanctions on Russia: Ukraine Update Russia Invasion of Ukraine Ignites European Security Crisis Russia Hits Airfields; Kyiv Imposes Martial Law: Ukraine Update Stocks Rise as Oil Pares Gain After Biden Address: Markets Wrap Six Early Thoughts on Russia's Invasion of Ukraine It got much worse for their net worth after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine. In less than 24 hours, they lost $39 billion — more than they had up to that point this year. The damage was across asset classes. Russia’s benchmark MOEX Russia Index closed 33% lower in Moscow, the fifth-worst plunge in stock market history in local currency terms. It marked the first time since 1987’s Black Monday crash that a decline of that magnitude hit a market worth more than $50 billion. UBS Group AG, meantime, triggered margin calls on some wealth management clients that use Russian bonds as collateral for their portfolios after cutting the lending value of some debt from the country to zero, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News. The Swiss wealth manager says it caters to half of the world’s billionaires. One of the worst security crises in Europe since World War II threatens to deepen market declines in the region, but especially in Russia, which has been hit with sanctions by the U.S. and U.K. A handful of billionaires, including Gennady Timchenko, are also subject to penalties for their ties to Putin, though there are calls for widening the potential targets. Read more: Here Are the Russian Billionaires Facing Sanctions Over Ukraine “There are a lot of people in the U.S. and Europe who want to hit them directly,” Chris Miller, co-director of the Russia and Eurasia program at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, said of Russian billionaires in an interview. “I don’t think there’s any good news in the sanctions for them.” Vagit Alekperov, the chairman of Lukoil, saw the sharpest decline in his net worth. It was slashed by almost a third in a day, falling by about $6.2 billion to $13 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Shares of the Moscow-based oil producer slumped about 33% on Thursday. Alexey Mordashov, chairman of the steelmaker Severstal, lost $4.2 billion on Thursday, bringing his fortune to $23 billion. Vladimir Potanin, president of Norilsk Nickel and currently Russia’s richest person, lost $3 billion. Alekperov and Timchenko have each lost about $10 billion this year, or more than 40% of their fortunes. Those are the biggest percentage declines among the Russian billionaires tracked by the Bloomberg wealth index.

2/26/2022,"In a recent note, Goldman Sachs chief global equity strategist Peter Oppenheimer points out that markets are going to normalize again, and soon – but with some differences over the recent past. Oppenheimer notes that mega-cap tech stocks have seen outsized gains, and that in much of the economy, we are seeing an evolution of everything into ‘tech companies.’ There’s no denying that digital tech and wireless networking are changing the ways that we do business, across the board. But while the tech mega-caps for the most part have propped up the markets for the past year, many other stocks have taken sound beatings. However, Oppenheimer believes we are returning to a more “normal” cycle. “We expect investors to be rewarded for making sector and stock decisions related to potential growth relative to what is priced,” he said. So let’s get away from what the markets have priced in, and start looking at that potential growth. GS analysts have done just that and following strategist Oppenheimer’s lead they are picking out stocks with upside ahead. These are names which have taken a beating over the past year but are projected to yield nice returns over the next 12 months – in the order of 50% or more. Using the TipRanks platform, we’ve looked up the details on these Goldman picks. Here they are, along with commentary from the analysts. KnowBe4 (KNBE) If the market is evolving towards a more tech-centered orientation, then it follows that digital tech security will become more important than ever. KnowBe4 is a leader in the field, and since its founding in 2010 the company has developed a reputation for building strong online security systems. It does this by training its customers’ workforces, to bring a higher level of digital security awareness to today’s office cultures. KnowBe4 has over 47,000 enterprise clients globally, subscribing to the firm’s online classes and services. The company’s offerings are supported in multiple languages, and customers can use KnowBe4’s platform to simulate phishing attacks – a method that truly drives home the lessons in online security. This company took advantage of last year’s rising stock market to go public. In April 2021, KnowBe4 held an IPO in which it put over 9.5 million shares on the market, with initial pricing at $16. This price was at the low end of the expected range – but the stock opened at more than $19 on April 22, and closed that day above $24. The offering raised well over $152 million gross proceeds. Since the IPO, KNBE shares have retreated – and are down by 47% from the peak value they reached in June. The news on KNBE has been upbeat lately, even though the stock has been feeling heavy pressure. The company released its 4Q21 numbers earlier this month, and beat on EPS by a wide margin. Markets had expected a nominal 1-cent per share profit – but the company reported 7 cents. Top line revenue also beat, but by a narrower margin; the number came in at $69.3 million, against a forecast of $67.2 million. Since the IPO, it was the third quarter in a row to show a sequential revenue gain. And better for investors, the company raised its forward guidance for full-year 2022 revenue by 6.7%. Goldman’s Brian Essex takes an upbeat view of KnowBe4’s prospects, writing, “…as the company focuses on platform expansion, penetration of International markets, progress up market, and better attach rates, potential for upside to initial FY22 growth outlook offsets potential investment-related margin softness in our view. With the stock trading at 11.8x EV/NTM revenue as of market close, implying 0.3x EV/Sales/Growth, we view valuation attractive for a company delivering growth and cash flow at these levels while establishing a track record of outperforming relative to expectations.” Essex gives KnowBe4 a Buy rating and his $32 price target implies a one-year upside of 69%. (To watch Essex’s track record, click here.) KnowBe4’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is supported by 9 recent reviews, including 6 to Buy and 3 to Hold. The stock is selling for $18.92 and its average price target of $31 suggests an upside of 64% over the next 12 months. (See KnowBe4’s stock analysis at TipRanks.) Signify Health (SGFY) One of the better trends in the healthcare industry in recent years – and one that was accelerated by the COVID crisis – is the move toward a less facility-centered approach to care. In-home testing, diagnostics, and practitioner consultations, sometimes as an adjunct to or sometimes supported by teledoc services, is becoming more the norm. Signify is stepping directly into this niche. The company works with Medicare and Medicaid plans to provide in-home services to plan members, with a goal of more healthy days at home – and away from a clinic. Signify’s services are based on a nationwide network with more than 9,000 credentialed medical professionals, including physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. The company’s network can observe and document health issues and hazards in the home, identify social determinants of health, and perform diagnostic and preventative services. As an example of Signify’s scale of service, the company completed over 1.4 million in-home health evaluations in 2020. In 2021, Signify entered the public markets through an IPO. The SGFY ticker opened on Wall Street on February 11, 2021 at $32 per share, well above their set price of $24 – which in turn had been raised from an initial range of $20 to $21. The company put over 23 million shares on the market, and raised $564 million in the IPO. SGFY closed at more than $31 on its first day trading – but since then, the stock has fallen steadily, and is now down by 64% in the last 12 months. In its first year as a public entity, Signify has consistently shown revenue in the range between $180 million and $212 million. In the most recent quarter reported, 3Q21, EPS came in at 12 cents, 4x higher than the 3-cent forecast. The company will report 4Q21 results next month. In coverage for Goldman, analyst Cindy Motz writes of Signify, “We like the company’s differentiated home health model that leverages a nationwide, mobilizable clinician network and think they are well-positioned to not only benefit from increasing focus on value-based care (a concept that has been around for a while), but also on what we believe will be increasing trends in more in-home healthcare. We see Signify as one of those unique players that is addressing all three of our fundamental drivers of long-term growth in healthcare technology. Since most people would rather remain in their homes, versus be in hospitals or long-term nursing facilities, we believe Signify’s solution has the ability to address and result in better patient outcomes and lower overall medical costs.” These comments back up Motz’s Buy rating, while her $20 price target indicates room for 55% share growth in the year ahead. (To watch Motz’s track record, click here.) Signify health has picked up 3 analyst reviews since going public and all are positive, making the Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. The shares are priced at $12.86 and have an average price target of $24.33, suggesting an 89% one-year upside. (See Signify’s stock analysis at TipRanks.) Health Catalyst (HCAT) Home health isn’t the only sea change overtaking the health care industry. Modern data tech has been forcing equally large changes to the sector. Health Catalyst, a software company specializing in data and analytics technology for health care systems, offers a range of products for health care providers to manage data, develop analytical insights, and leverage those to measurable improvements in clinical and financial operations. The company’s products include a cloud-based data platform, data analytics software, and the professional services to back those up. Health Catalyst has seen 5 quarters in a row of sequential revenue gains, starting in Q3 2020. The company’s last report, from 3Q21, showed $61.74 million at the top line. This was up 30% from the year-ago quarter, and up 56% from 3Q19. It’s an impressive rate of revenue growth for any company. On EPS, Health Catalyst typically runs a loss, although in the latest report not as deep a loss as the analysts predicted. In 3Q21, the company reported an EPS loss of 18 cents, against the 22-cent loss expected. Despite consistently beating the forecasts on EPS losses, and consistently growing revenue, Health Catalyst’s shares are down from the peak they reached in July of last year. In those 8 months, the stock has fallen 54%. Goldman analyst Motz, however, sees Health Catalyst in a strong place, and the current low price as a chance to buy in. She writes, “In our view, HCAT represents a well-executed, differentiated, advanced AI Healthcare Technology platform that satisfies all of our fundamental growth drivers of enabling doctors and creating better patient outcomes with its clinical diagnostic tools, as well as lowering costs with its cost-based applications…. Although HCAT is EBITDA negative presently, we see that changing for full year 2023, and then ramping nicely from there (unless HCAT undertakes an acquisition which it has indicated it may have an interest in at the app layer). Additionally, to the extent the company broadens its TAM, we would anticipate its margins being able to grow further beyond their indicated 20%+ range and beyond.” In line with these upbeat comments, Motz rates the stock as a Buy and sets a $48 price target that suggests an upside potential of 76% for the coming year. This is a stock with 5 reviews on record, including 4 Buys against 1 Hold for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target here, $52.60, implies a one-year upside of 93% from the current share price of $27.19. (See Health Catalyst’s stock forecast at TipRanks.)

2/26/2022,"As Russia launches a war against Ukraine, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) — down more than 3% at Thursday's open — mounted a furious comeback, with megacap stocks Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) doing much of the heavy lifting. However, the eight largest U.S. publicly traded companies have hemorrhaged over $2 trillion in market capitalization since their combined value peaked in mid-November. According to one Wall Street strategist, the geopolitical maelstrom may give bottom-fishing investors the opportunity to start nibbling at beaten-down stocks. The combined market cap of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta Platforms (FB), Nvidia (NVDA), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) surged 168% from the pandemic low — from $4.3 trillion to a peak of $11.7 trillion on Nov. 19. Shortly thereafter, Apple would briefly top $3 trillion in value — but tantalizingly, it was never able to settle over that milestone valuation. As inflation picked up sharply in the fourth quarter, U.S. Treasury yields across the curve (^FVX, ^TNX, ^TYX) surged higher. However, the shorter maturities gained more quickly than the long end — flattening the yield curve. In early January, investors woke up to the most hawkish Federal Reserve in 40 years, along with economic data rolling in on the toll the Omicron variant was taking on spending and the labor market, as vast swaths of workers called in sick for weeks. This set the stage for the messy year investors have faced so far — with pricey growth companies and financial stocks flagging as the yield curve flattens. In the S&P 500 (^GSPC), only the energy sector has advanced this year — up over 20%. That's as WTI crude oil (CL=F) finally hit north of $100/bbl — for the first time since mid-2014. This year alone, the average megacap stock is returning a loss of 17.6%, with Meta leading the way down — off 41.0% — thanks to a major earnings disappointment. But even Alphabet, which popped 7.5% after a big earnings beat, is down 12% this year. Tesla and Nvidia are each off by more than 20%. Yet despite the carnage, investors are on the lookout for signs of selling capitulation to mark a potential bottom. DailyFX.com Senior Strategist Christopher Vecchio joined Yahoo Finance Live early Thursday as the Nasdaq opened down nearly 3.5%. To help find signs of a bottom, Vecchio said investors should look to see elevated fear levels in the market as expressed by the CBOE Volatility Index (^VIX) and the CBOE VVIX Index (^VVIX). ""During other market sell-off episodes, two things have popped out that suggest we're nearing an exhaustion point. That would be [the] VIX above 35, and VVIX — the volatility of the volatility index — moving above 150. We didn't see that yesterday. It's likely that we're going to see that today,"" said Vecchio. By midday Thursday, the VIX had peaked at nearly 38, and the VVIX had topped out at 145. Vecchio is also looking at some of the broader index levels falling into territory not seen since last year — giving some confidence to dip a toe in the investing waters again on a short-term basis. ""Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are coming into some technically significant levels — really going back to the May 2021 lows. And I do think that at that point in time, given the specter of this sell-off, it becomes sensible from a risk-reward standpoint — at least try to cherry pick a short-term bottom,"" he said. EvercoreISI tech analyst Mark Mahaney shared a similar sentiment on Yahoo Finance Live Thursday, arguing that it makes sense to buy quality names at these levels — like Amazon and Google — if one's investment time frame is longer. ""If you have a 9 to 12 month outlook, you will be able to start off buying the highest quality names,"" said Mahaney. Vecchio stresses that Russia is only a catalyst against the backdrop of several larger market themes. ""This all ties back to what's happening with the Fed in March. Russia is an accelerant here, but the conditions are in place for weaker stocks. You have a decline in corporate earnings, a weaker growth environment and of course record high inflation."" Analysts have been quick to point out that the Fed is less likely to front-load the monetary tightening process against the new geopolitical backdrop. Vecchio believes the Fed will hike its benchmark rate in March by only 25 basis points instead of 50 bps — regardless of the final inflation numbers that are released before the meeting. ""[U]ltimately given the scale of the decline we've seen thus far — looking into those May 2021 lows — it is a stopping point for further bleeding,"" said Vecchio, referring to the price action in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq early Thursday.
