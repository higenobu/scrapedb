2/9/2022,"Some politicians might just wonder how low their careers can go after being asked to serve in a department run by Nadine Dorries. Not Chris Philp. Then again, the digital minister is no normal number two. That’s a level of responsibility of which he can only dream. Philp is much more a natural number 5. And only then because there is no number 6. He is a man who can be guaranteed not to demonstrate having a conscience. Not because he is intrinsically evil or amoral, but because he is too dim to have an original thought in his head. He is someone who can be relied on to repeat the last thing someone said to him and believe it to be true. All of which made Philp the ideal candidate for the morning media round, as the only question he was going to be asked was whether the prime minister should apologise for his Jimmy Savile remarks after the previous evening’s protests in which Keir Starmer had been abused and harassed. And the Philpster duly adopted His Master’s Voice by parroting the lines he had been told to learn.  He began by insisting that Boris Johnson’s words had been misconstrued. Which bit of Big Dog saying that Starmer had failed to prosecute Savile had been misconstrued, he wasn’t entirely sure. After all, The Suspect had been completely unambiguous when he had called out the Labour leader in the Commons during his statement on the Sue Gray report. Undeterred, the Philpster then tried to realign himself with the prime minister’s subsequent remarks. What the Suspect had really meant was that Starmer – like Big Dog – had been forced to accept responsibility for things that weren’t his fault. Only it turned out that Johnson was being asked to take responsibility for things that were his fault. He had attended at least six of the parties and had probably known about most of the others. Hardly the same as apologising for a decision that had been taken by others in your organisation. Having – as he saw it – established the basic facts, the minister then went on to ad lib rather. Always a mistake when you’re not very bright. It was like this: there was no need for The Suspect to apologise for having incited a load of protesters. Rather, the protesters should have been apologising to him. After all, the mob had also shouted out slogans about anti-vaxxers and Julian Assange, so they should have known better than to drag the prime minister into the debate by also mentioning Savile. Besides which, it was evident that the protesters would have been out on the street giving Starmer a hard time regardless, so The Suspect could hardly be blamed even if they did shout out the odd “Jimmy Savile” line. In any case, it wasn’t as if Boris had invented the Savile slur himself. He’d just come across it by chance on a far right, extremist website. As you do. So surely it was up to the people who were in charge of writing this stuff on the interweb to make sure their information was accurate before people like the prime minister got into trouble by repeating it? LBC’s Nick Ferrari looked at Philp as if he were an idiot. Fair enough. A lot of us have done the same thing. The case was cut and dried. It was straight out of the Trump playbook. Spew out enough lies and some of them will be believed. Then take no responsibility for any actions incited by the lies. So Ferrari tried taking Philp back to basics. Would he have used the Savile attack against Starmer? “Er … what Savile attack?” simpered Philp. He didn’t know about any Savile attack. The one we’ve just been talking about, Ferrari replied. Oh that one! That wasn’t an attack. That was just the prime minister trying to identify with the heavy burden of office that both men shared. Fine. But would he have said it? Oh God, no. He had never knowingly said anything controversial in his life. He was just an empty shell. Waiting to be filled with whatever his childminders told him. The best part of being Chris Philp is that you don’t really know when Chris Philp has been in a train wreck of interviews. As far as he was concerned, he had done a top job protecting The Suspect’s reputation. So he went back to his department blissfully unaware that most people outside the Boris cabal thought The Suspect had lied and needed to publicly apologise. Not that he would. Why break the habit of a lifetime? Not everyone in government was having such a good day. Jacob Rees-Mogg had just got the call that he was being moved from leader of the house to a new post of “minister for Brexit opportunities”. But what did that mean – other than a chance to celebrate the collapse of the Northern Ireland peace process? Boris had been at his most opaque. “Look at it this way, Jakey,” he had said. “You’re going to have a lot more time on your hands. Especially when I’m gone and you return to the backbenchers. Face it, no one but me would have you in the cabinet.” To be fair, Big Dog had said exactly the same to Michael Ellis when he had told him he was being promoted for three times defending him over partygate when no one else would. Then, that was the point of Mike. To do the jobs others had too much self-worth to do. Still, Ellis didn’t care about the cabinet job so much as the knighthood he’d craved for years. Come the resignation honours list, his life would finally have meaning.

2/9/2022,"In the run up to Christmas, as the UK government was frantically attempting to manage the latest wave of Covid infections, Conservative MP and long time agitator Steve Baker was apparently touring the tea rooms of parliament trying to persuade colleagues to sign up to his latest cause. The self-described Brexit hardman, who as the then head of the European Research Group had relentlessly harried Theresa May’s government over Brexit and then become a thorn in Boris Johnson’s side with his anti-lockdown Covid Recovery Group, had a new – and he believed potentially explosive – target: the government’s climate agenda.  “When the full costs of net zero start hitting us,” Baker told an interviewer recently, “we could end up with something bigger than the poll tax, certainly bigger than Brexit.” Baker is a key member of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, a Tory grouping which was set up by his fellow Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay last summer. Although the group says it accepts the fundamental facts of the climate emergency and the need to reduce emissions, they argue the government’s net zero plans – widely viewed as vague and lacking sufficient ambition by activists and experts – are in fact too bold, dreamed up by out of touch elites, and would impoverish working people, “making them colder and poorer”. Initially it appeared the group was gaining minimal traction. Evidence of the climate crisis was escalating as extreme weather events hit countries around the world and, in the run-up to last year’s UN climate summit in Glasgow, support for more urgent and far-reaching action to reduce emissions was growing. However, as gas prices soared and concern about a growing cost of living crisis escalated, it appears Baker and Mackinlay sensed an opportunity. According to several Conservative MPs who spoke to the Guardian, the pair stepped up their recruitment campaign in the corridors of Westminster ahead of the Christmas break, showing colleagues – particularly the new intake of Tory MPs elected in 2019 to represent former Labour-held constituencies – alarming graphs and data about the cost of living crisis. They argued the net zero target was becoming “politically toxic” and warned that the government’s obsession with the green agenda was putting their slim majorities at risk. One red wall MP who Baker spoke to, said: “We have been approached by older, more established Tories, who want us to say our constituents will be hit hard by net zero policies. It’s all a bit cynical.” But at the beginning of January, their efforts appeared to bear fruit when 19 Tories, including ex-minister Esther McVey, senior backbencher Robert Halfon, and several red wall MPs, identified themselves as members of the group, signing a letter to the Sunday Telegraph arguing for an end to green levies and calling for more fossil fuel extraction. The Tory members Craig Mackinlay Steve Baker Peter Lilley Esther McVey Robert Halfon Julian Knight Anne Marie Morris (currently independent) Andrew Bridgen David Jones Scott Benton Damien Moore Mark Jenkinson Andrew Lewer Karl McCartney Marcus Fysh Greg Smith Lee Anderson Philip Davies Adam Holloway Craig Tracey It was the first time members of the group had gone public. The story was picked up across the media: “Gas prices: MPs and peers urge PM to act on energy bills,” reported the BBC; “Pressure grows on Boris Johnson over energy bills,” wrote the Daily Mail. The message was amplified on TV and radio, and for many climate scientists it suggested the consensus around the need for climate action in Conservative ranks – however inadequate it had been – was under threat for the first time in years. But many of those initial reports did not mention the links of some of the group’s key members. Baker is a trustee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a prominent publisher of material questioning the consensus on climate science in the UK since it was launched by former cabinet minister and long time climate denier Nigel Lawson in 2009 . The GWPF is characterised by opponents as a source of climate science denial – a claim it denies. During the Cop26 climate summit last year, Lord Lawson wrote an article arguing that “global warming is not a problem”, defended burning fossil fuels, and said carbon dioxide’s “principal effect” is the growth of plants. Baker declined to be interviewed for this piece, pointing to Mackinlay as a spokesperson. MacKinlay also declined to be interviewed. Three members of the NZSG did respond, stating they did not dispute climate science or the need to decarbonise, although they did object to the government’s current net zero plans. Mark Jenkinson, MP for Workington, who called those who opposed the Cumbria coal mine “climate alarmists”, said he was confident it was possible to reach net zero “without making my constituents poorer.” He added: “I’m delighted that we’re having the adult discussions that so many outside the Conservative party are afraid of having, around the ongoing need for UK oil and gas for transition to net zero by 2050 and beyond it.” Halfon said: “Millions are now being hit desperately hard by the cost of living crisis with heating and fuel bills soaring. We cannot sacrifice any further their ability to cope on the altar of climate change.” In the autumn, as the GWPF campaigning arm rebranded itself as Net Zero Watch, to “scrutinise policies, establish what they really cost, determine who will have to pay”, Baker and Mackinlay were apparently stepping up their Net Zero Scrutiny Group recruitment drive. Tories who spoke to the Guardian said the pair showed MPs polling that had been commissioned by GWPF that set out a stark picture of a population deeply concerned about the cost of living crisis and wary of paying “higher taxes to help reach net zero.” Lord Lilley, a former cabinet minister and self-described “global lukewarmist”, also signed the NZSG letter to the Sunday Telegraph and is a former trustee of the GWPF . The GWPF confirmed that both Lilley and Baker attended its annual lecture at the end of November, where the main speaker, US scientist Prof Steven Koonin – who admits the climate is changing and humans are responsible – questioned the scientific consensus around the climate crisis. During his talk Koonin told the audience: “The first thing we can do is get authoritative bodies – the royal societies, the US national academies – to stand up and say there is no climate crisis. This is an issue, we can deal with it in due course – but let’s all relax.” The Guardian showed a video of the event to three leading climate scientists – Simon Lewis, professor of global change science at University College London, Julia Steinberger, professor of societal challenges of climate change at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland and a lead author with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and professor Peter Stott who leads the climate monitoring and attribution team of the Hadley Centre for Climate Science and Services at the Met Office in Exeter. They suggested that the talk “cherry picked data” and “distorted” the facts of climate science. And they questioned whether members of the UK’s ruling party should be getting their evidence about the climate crisis from such events. “It is really deeply worrying that members of parliament are going and getting their scientific information from there,” said Lewis. Steinberger suggested the talk was “a classic, if rather polished and polite, example of distorting climate science.” In response, Koonin expressed disappointment at the criticisms. He added: “Viewers of my talk will see that my points are specific, relevant and well-supported by references to the literature and data.” After initially talking to the Guardian for this article, both Lilley and the GWPF did not respond to subsequent written questions. There are tentative signs that the attack on the net zero agenda appears to be taking root. Members of the group have regularly surfaced across the media over the past few weeks to question the government’s plans. Last week a front page of the Daily Telegraph quoted “senior cabinet ministers” urging the government to “rethink its net zero plans”, with one arguing we should “not be running towards net zero so aggressively”. Outside parliament, a slew of rightwing commentators and talking heads – from Andrew Neil to Nigel Farage – have portrayed the climate agenda as a classic culture war, “dreamed up in the kitchen diners of Notting Hill, with no understanding of real people’s daily lives,” as Julian Knight, a fellow Tory MP and member of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group wrote in a report last year. James Murray, editor of the website BusinessGreen, said the emergence of this anti net zero narrative – and its amplification in sections of the media – threatened to unite the libertarian right and culture warriors against the need for urgent climate action. “The idea we should dilute and delay climate action is unpopular with the public, runs counter to global investment trends, and is contrary to the government’s own manifesto, but environmental campaigners and green businesses are still hugely concerned that they could be dragged deeper into a culture war that seeks to politicise any and all efforts to decarbonise.” He said soaring gas prices and the cost of living crisis presented a “huge opportunity” for those intent on scrapping “green policies they are ideologically opposed to and increase the UK’s reliance on polluting fossil fuels.” “The challenge for the government is that concerns over some of the near-term costs associated with the net zero transition are valid, and as such there is an urgent need to both promote the overwhelming economic benefits of climate action and ensure any costs are fairly shared.” Asad Rehman, an influential climate justice campaigner and director of War On Want, said that the emergence of opposition to the government’s climate plans underscored the need for a global green new deal. “Climate justice means addressing the systemic issues of economic injustice and poverty that sit at the heart of the climate crisis. If it doesn’t, it simply hands an opportunity for rightwing populists to pit those already struggling to make ends meet against any proposals to transition our economy.” The most comprehensive analysis of the path to net zero was published by the UK’s Climate Change Committee, the government’s statutory adviser, which has repeatedly said the costs of action are small and diminishing, at less than 1% of GDP by 2050, while the costs of inaction are large and rising. Dr Ajay Gambhir, a senior research fellow at the Grantham Institute – Climate Change and the Environment, said that as innovation accelerated, even the CCC’s costings were probably an over-estimate, and did not take account of the many co-benefits of climate action, including cleaner air and water, more biodiversity, millions of well-paid green jobs and lower energy bills. And it is not just environmentalists who champion net zero. Last week, Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of one of the big six energy companies SSE, said: “Net zero is not only an environmental decision, it’s a rational economic one. Investing now will not only reduce our future exposure to gas markets but it will also support jobs and growth.” But as instability continues to engulf the Conservative party and Boris Johnson – seen as the party’s standard bearer for net zero – appears weaker by the day, more voices, from local Tory councillors to rightwing commentators, are linking the cost of living crisis and the government’s green agenda. Lilley told the Guardian that Conservative MPs were being newly recruited to the group in the tea rooms of parliament. He said: “The Net Zero Scrutiny Group wasn’t my idea – it came up in discussion over a cup of tea in the tea rooms. It may well have been Steve Baker who was the inventor.” The peer said his colleagues in cabinet were “trying to show how virtuous they are” by pushing climate policies – and believes we are likely to have a gilet jaunes-style uprising in the UK over energy costs. “Whenever the cost of decarbonising has become a political issue, the advocates – the opponents of imposing those costs on people’s budgets – have won. Look at the gilet jaunes in France, the Netherlands municipal elections, the Australian elections. People agree with tackling global warming in the abstract – but they aren’t prepared to pay for something that won’t have an impact perhaps for a century or more,” he warned. There is some pushback from pro-climate MPs within the Conservative party. Chris Skidmore, MP for Kingswood and a former energy minister, has set up a new Net Zero Support Group. “I was a bit shocked about the amount of coverage [the Net Zero Scrutiny Group] was getting,” Skidmore said. “And I thought it doesn’t speak for me or the many many other Tory MPs who do support net zero and do support action on climate change.” He added: “My fear is that this group creates a narrative that it is the cost of green energy that is creating the energy price crisis – that it is either tackling the climate crisis or tackling the cost of living crisis.” Last week, Tory peer and leading Conservative environmentalist Zac Goldsmith said: “Ninety per cent of the global economy is committed to net zero. The politics is clear … Choosing to be the outlier would be insane.” A current environment minister said that Baker and Mackinlay’s group was of no concern to the government and was being widely ignored. But in a recent interview, Baker was unequivocal about the potential of the net zero campaign. “I’ve started three big projects of MPs on the issue of the day – one on Brexit, one on COvi, which of course affected everybody, and one on net zero. “Of the three of them, the one that grew fastest by miles was net zero, simply because members of parliament know this is going to hit all voters and hit them hard and hit them fast and they aren’t going to like it.”",News/Environment,‘It’s all a bit cynical’: the politicians behind the Tory attack on net zero agenda,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/08/its-all-a-bit-cynical-the-politicians-behind-the-tory-attack-on-net-zero-agenda
2/9/2022,"A group of Conservative politicians and their allies are on the “frontline” of a new climate war and are attempting to derail the government’s green agenda, according to claims by leading climate scientists. Tory MPs and peers in the Net Zero Scrutiny Group have gained widespread media coverage in the past month, attempting to link the government’s net zero agenda to the cost-of-living crisis and calling for cuts to green taxes and an increase of fossil fuel production.  Some members claim the government’s plans to reach net zero emissions by 2050 have been dreamed up by out-of-touch elites and would impoverish working people, “making them colder and poorer”. The 19 Conservatives confirmed to be in the group say they do not dispute climate science or the need to decarbonise. Two leading members have links to an organisation, often described as “climate-sceptic”, that was founded by long-term climate denier Lord Lawson. The group’s chair, the MP Craig Mackinlay, has also been accused by a leading climate institute of using misleading and inaccurate information. Michael Mann, one of the world’s leading authorities on climate and author of The New Climate War, said the group appeared to be attempting to drag climate policies into a culture war, which he described as a “dangerous new tactic being used by those opposed to addressing the ecological emergency”. “This is where the frontline of the battle is now, and yes, we do have to push back fiercely on this sort of pernicious disinformation,” he told the Guardian. Tory MPs involved in the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) include the Brexit campaigner Steve Baker; the former work and pension secretary Esther McVey; Robert Halfon, a former schools minister, and Lord Peter Lilley. There are also several “red wall” MPs elected in 2019. The Tory members Craig Mackinlay Steve Baker Peter Lilley Esther McVey Robert Halfon Julian Knight Anne Marie Morris (currently independent) Andrew Bridgen David Jones Scott Benton Damien Moore Mark Jenkinson Andrew Lewer Karl McCartney Marcus Fysh Greg Smith Lee Anderson Philip Davies Adam Holloway Craig Tracey Baker is a trustee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, launched by Lawson in 2009. The organisation – which recently rebranded its campaigning arm to “net zero watch” – is characterised by its opponents as being one of Britain’s biggest sources of climate science denial, a claim it denies. It and the NZSG of Conservative politicians have recently turned their attention to the costs of the government’s decarbonisation plans. Lord Lilley and Baker were at the thinktank’s annual lecture at the end of November last year where the main speaker, the US scientist Prof Steven Koonin, who admits the climate is changing and humans are responsible, questioned the scientific consensus around the climate crisis. He told the audience: “The first thing we can do is get authoritative bodies – the Royal Societies, the US National Academies – to stand up and say there is no climate crisis. This is an issue, we can deal with it in due course, but let’s all relax.” Leading climate scientists, shown a video of the event by the Guardian, suggested it had “cherrypicked data” and “distorted” the facts of climate science. They also questioned whether members of the UK’s ruling party might be getting their evidence about the climate crisis from such events. In response, Koonin expressed disappointment at the criticisms, adding: “Viewers of my talk will see that my points are specific, relevant, and well-supported by references to the literature and data.” Analysis by the Guardian also found that more than half of the members of the NZSG were members of the European Research Group (ERG), which successfully pushed for the Brexit referendum inside the Tory party. This has led to fears they could push for a similar culture war over net zero – and even a referendum. Nigel Farage, another veteran of the Brexit campaign, has said he is agitating for a referendum on net zero, and Baker says the anti-net zero campaign will be bigger than Brexit. A Tory MP told the Guardian that he considered Steve is “seeing this like Brexit: he sees net zero and the [global warming target of] 1.5C as an imposition from an unelected remote bureaucracy that must be defeated.” Dr Benny Peiser, a longtime policy lead for GWPF and director of its net zero watch campaign, said it did not dispute the need to decarbonise, but he was pleased that Tory MPs were now willing to put their name to opposition to net zero. He told the Guardian: “We are obviously delighted that MPs are beginning to recognise that there’s a problem. Now for the first time we have a proper debate about the pros and the cons of the different options.” The GWPF did not respond to subsequent written questions from the Guardian. A number of experts dismiss the NZSG’s claims around the cost of net zero, saying the costs are relatively small and diminishing, at less than 1% of GDP by 2050. They also point out the multiple benefits of moving rapidly away from fossil fuels, from cleaner air and water to well-paid green jobs and lower energy bills. Mackinlay was accused of misinformation by the Grantham Institute at the London School of Economics. It suggested he had relied on “inaccurate and misleading claims, particularly about the investments required to achieve the statutory target of net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, in order to promote [the NZSG] cause.” Some members of the group appear to have mocked climate policies or questioned the need for rapid action on reducing emissions. Scott Benton, the MP for Blackpool South, tweeted in November: “It’s Gender Day at #cop26 today. Apparently women and girls are more susceptible to climate change than others so the government’s naturally making £165 million available to address this apparent disparity. You really couldn’t make it up.” Mark Jenkinson, the MP for Workington, has lobbied for more coalmines to be opened, calling those who opposed the Cumbria coalmine “climate alarmists” and saying: “Apocalypticism risks becoming the new UK religion.” Lilley had an initial conversation with the Guardian but he and Baker did not respond to subsequent written questions about the article. Mackinlay confirmed his role as chair but declined to say more. Three members of the NZSG did respond, stating they did not dispute climate science or the need to decarbonise, although they did object to the government’s current net zero plans. Jenkinson said he was confident it was possible to reach net zero “without making my constituents poorer”. “I’m delighted that we’re having the adult discussions that so many outside the Conservative party are afraid of having, around the ongoing need for UK oil and gas for transition to net zero by 2050 and beyond it,” he added. Robert Halfon said: “Millions are now being hit desperately hard by the cost-of-living crisis with heating and fuel bills soaring. We cannot sacrifice any further their ability to cope on the altar of climate change.” There is opposition to the group within the Conservative party. Chris Skidmore MP, a former energy minister, has set up a new “net zero support group”, and a current environment minister told the Guardian that the NZSG was of “no concern to the government” and was being widely ignored. The former Tory environment secretary Theresa Villiers also urged her party not to slip into a “culture war” over climate: “It should be dealt with in the context of a normal political debate, I hope we don’t start to see a culture war in this area.” But as Boris Johnson – seen as a Tory standard-bearer for net zero – fights for his political life, attacks on net zero are continuing. After last week’s energy price hike, “senior cabinet ministers” were quoted on the front page of the Daily Telegraph urging the government to “rethink its net zero plans”. James Murray, the editor of the website BusinessGreen and a leading environmental commentator, said: “Those within government and beyond that accept the net zero transition is the defining economic project of the age would be wise not to underestimate the threat. Opposition to climate action may be on the periphery. But as the past few years have taught us, ideas that were on the periphery can become very influential, very quickly.”",News/Politics,"Tories fighting net zero plans are dragging climate into new culture war, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/08/tories-fighting-net-zero-plans-are-dragging-climate-into-new-culture-war-experts-say
2/9/2022,"Chris Heaton-Harris has been trusted by Boris Johnson to marshal Tory MPs during the most hazardous period of his political career. The newly appointed chief whip is a longtime insider and minister who remains little known to the public – beyond the occasional mini-controversy. The MP for Daventry since 2010, who is now onto his seventh ministerial role in six years (though the first in the cabinet), is a die-hard Brexit supporter whose fervour for the cause brought perhaps his most uncomfortable moment in the spotlight.  In 2017, when he was a junior whip under Theresa May, Heaton-Harris was accused of attempted McCarthyism when he wrote to the vice-chancellors of all English universities asking them to declare what they were teaching about Brexit, and to give a list of teachers’ names. His letter asked for a copy of each university’s syllabus and any online lectures on Brexit, with a series of university leaders calling the requests sinister and unprecedented. While Heaton-Harris argued he was seeking the information in his role as a whip, he was soon cut adrift by Downing Street, which said he had been acting purely as an individual MP. He remained a minister, becoming a junior Brexit minister in 2018. The following year he resigned in protest after May began talks with Labour on a possible end to the Brexit impasse. When May stepped down, Heaton-Harris backed Andrea Leadsom as the new leader – she was eliminated in the first round of Tory MP voting. Heaton-Harris returned to the government under Johnson, spending two years as a junior transport minister, with duties including helping to enforce Downing Street’s efforts to promote cycling in the face of scepticism from some Tory-run councils. In December last year, he began what became a brief stint as Europe minister in the Foreign Office, but spent increasing amounts of his time helping Johnson with what was, in effect, an unofficial second whipping team, liaising with backbenchers increasingly disgruntled over reports about alleged lockdown-breaking parties. In a slightly unlikely sideline, Heaton-Harris is also a devoted fan of tweeting what appear to be deliberately bad dad jokes, although he has held off recently. A sample of his oeuvre is: “For my next trick, I will eat a percussion instrument in a bap. Drum roll please...” Being a chief whip is never the easiest of cabinet jobs even at the best of times – and this is far from that. If Heaton-Harris manages to even stem the trickle of no-confidence letters from Tory MPs, buying time for Johnson to plot a fightback, he will have repaid the PM’s confidence in him.",News/Politics,Chris Heaton-Harris: new chief whip no stranger to controversy,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/08/chris-heaton-harris-new-chief-whip-no-stranger-to-controversy
2/9/2022,"Acash machine. That was how Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP, described his company back in November following last year’s sharp rise in global oil and gas prices. And the size of the company’s bank balance has now duly been revealed: profits just shy of £10bn last year – the highest in eight years. Clearly, these are windfall gains. BP had not expected a fivefold increase in the wholesale price of gas during 2012. Nor did it forecast that the cost of crude oil would currently be nudging its way towards $100 a barrel.  Unsurprisingly, therefore, there have been calls for the government to make a sizable withdrawal from the cash machine in the form of a windfall tax. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, was quick to repeat Labour’s call for a one-off increase in corporation tax on North Sea producers to fund lower bills for consumers. Hang on a bit, BP and the other energy companies say. High prices now are simply the corollary of rock-bottom prices during the depths of the pandemic, a period when crude prices briefly dipped below zero. What’s more, the government has been urging energy companies, such as BP, to invest more in renewables in order to speed up the UK’s transition to a net zero carbon economy. Ministers can either have a short-term, and partial, fix to Britain’s cost of living crisis or they can have a long-term solution to future energy needs. They can’t have both. Actually, they can. BP set out its plans to increase investment in renewables tenfold (from a low base) before it reaped windfall gains from rising fossil fuel prices. The fact that the company has earmarked more than £1bn for share buybacks – which boost the company’s share price – suggests BP would have no trouble sticking to its renewable investment strategy were a windfall tax to be levied. As things stand, a windfall tax is not part of Rishi Sunak’s plans, but he still has time to change his mind before the spring statement on 23 March. There are three reasons for a rethink: the cost of living crisis will leave millions of households a lot worse off even after the Treasury’s energy support package; previous Tory governments have found windfall taxes a useful way of raising money in tough times; and it would shoot Labour’s fox. Regulation was too lax. Only when it was too late did the penny drop that there was dodgy stuff going on. In retrospect, it might have been a good idea to tighten up supervision rather than put so much trust in the power of market forces. Sound familiar? Of course it does. That, broadly, was the result of the postmortem examination into the near-collapse of banks during the financial crisis of 2007-09. And it was what Jonathan Brearley, the head of the energy regulator Ofgem, had to say to MPs when asked to explain why 29 companies had gone bust in recent months. In both cases, there was the unmistakable sound of stable doors being shut long after the horse had bolted. In both cases, the British penchant for light-touch regulation meant insufficient attention was paid to financial resilience. Brearley said with “hindsight” there should have been tougher action to protect consumers against poorly-run providers, a statement of the obvious if ever there was one. The point about regulation is that it is supposed to work in the bad times as well as the good times. Ofgem spectacularly failed that test. Later this week the government will be able to boast of the strongest annual growth since the second world war. The advice of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) – one of the UK’s most august thinktanks – is that ministers should make the most of it because the good news is not going to last. The NIESR says the Bank of England is raising interest rates as it plays inflation catch-up, so it makes no sense for the Treasury to tighten policy simultaneously through tax increases. Indeed, the chancellor has a choice: scrap April’s planned national insurance increase or risk boom turning to bust. That choice seems to have been made and it is the wrong one.",News/Business,Sunak should reconsider oil and gas windfall tax after BP’s £10bn year,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/sunak-should-reconsider-oil-and-gas-windfall-tax-after-bps-10bn-year
2/9/2022,"The Catholic church is at the centre of a legal battle over attempts to force Catholic schools to become academies run by its own multi-academy trusts, against the wishes of school governors and headteachers. A consortium of school staff unions, including the National Association of Head Teachers and the Association of School and College Leaders, has written to Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, calling on him to withdraw academy orders issued to a group of Catholic schools by the Department for Education (DfE) or face legal action.  The threat came after the church’s Hallam diocese asked the DfE to order academy conversions for 19 Catholic faith schools in the diocese, which covers South Yorkshire and parts of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, including voluntary-aided schools. If successful the order would make all the schools into academies and place them in one of two new multi-academy trusts to be administered by the diocese, along with academies already members of other trusts. But the unions, including support staff who are members of Unison, say schools leaders and governors do not want to change their status and that they are prepared to seek a judicial review in the high court if Zahawi does not withdraw the orders. Schools can only be forced to become academies is if they are eligible for intervention, usually if they are rated as inadequate by Ofsted inspectors. None of the schools targeted by the diocese are in that category. Otherwise, the DfE can only make an academy order if it is requested by a school’s governing body. “We understand that the governing bodies of these schools have not applied to the secretary of state for academy orders. The academy orders appear to have been made on the application of and/or at the behest of the diocese,” the letter from the unions states. “The secretary of state is invited to confirm in writing that the academy orders are void and of no effect.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We are deeply concerned by what appears to be an abuse of the process of schools becoming academies. It is perfectly clear that the decision must come from governing bodies and yet this appears to have been flagrantly ignored. Nadhim Zahawi must intervene and put a stop to this sorry episode.” Other dioceses in England have been pushing schools to convert and join approved trusts, including the Birmingham diocese, which contains 240 schools, of which 90 retain voluntary-aided status. The DfE and the Hallam diocese were contacted for comment. In a letter sent to school leaders last year, the bishop of Hallam, Ralph Heskett, said he had “determined” that Catholic schools in the region would be best supported by becoming academies and joining specified trusts. “A Catholic multi-academy trust model throughout the diocese will mean that no individual school will be left isolated or vulnerable in this rapidly changing educational environment,” Heskett said.",News/Education,Catholic church in legal battle over bid to force schools to become academies,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/08/catholic-church-in-legal-battle-over-bid-to-force-schools-to-become-academies
2/9/2022,"Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad have been dramatically left out of England’s Test squad for the upcoming tour of the Caribbean, although the door has been left open for the seamers to make their international returns in the future. The 4-0 Ashes defeat to Australia has already seen Ashley Giles, Chris Silverwood and Graham Thorpe sacked from the management and now the casualties include the celebrated pair of bowlers with 1,177 Test wickets between them.  Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood, interim director of men’s cricket and head coach respectively, and the reprieved captain, Joe Root, have been locked in talks over the touring party for the three-Test series against West Indies that begins in Antigua on 8 March. Rory Burns, Jos Buttler, Haseeb Hameed and Dawid Malan also miss out on selection. Though in the autumn of their careers, both Anderson, 39, and Broad, 35, have missed out despite there being a strong cricketing case to say they remain among England’s best pool of bowlers. Broad finished up as the team’s second-highest wicket-taker in Australia, despite being poorly deployed. Joe Root (Yorkshire) captain, Jonathan Bairstow (Yorkshire), Zak Crawley (Kent), Matthew Fisher (Yorkshire), Ben Foakes (Surrey), Dan Lawrence (Essex), Jack Leach (Somerset), Alex Lees (Durham), Saqib Mahmood (Lancashire), Craig Overton (Somerset), Matt Parkinson (Lancashire), Ollie Pope (Surrey), Ollie Robinson (Sussex), Ben Stokes (Durham), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire), Mark Wood (Durham)  But in a move that is reminiscent of the start of England’s white-ball reboot in 2015 – one that ultimately resulted in the World Cup win four years later – Strauss has signed off on a dual omission in the hope others flourish out of their shadows. Whether this prompts retirement thoughts for either bowler remains to be seen; both are understood to have been told this tour is a case of exploring new options for now and that the new director of cricket and head coach – set to be appointed before the English summer – will have their own views. Coming off the back of an Ashes series that was essentially down to the batting line-up suffering a collective meltdown – and heading to the Caribbean where England have won just once in 54 series – it still represents a bold call by the caretaker management team. Strauss, who has already confirmed he will not seek to make his return permanent, kept open the door for them to return for home Tests against New Zealand and South Africa later this year. “In respect of James Anderson and Stuart Broad, I want to emphasise this does not mean the end for them as England players. We feel that it is important to look at some exciting new bowling potential and give some added responsibility to other players who have featured previously. “No one doubts the quality and experience that James and Stuart bring to the England set-up. It will be up to the new managing director and permanent head coach to decide on whether they will be involved this summer and beyond.“This selection of this squad is the start of a process and a journey to get England Test cricket back to where it needs to be, and the hard work starts now.” The Durham opener Alex Lees and the Yorkshire seamer Matthew Fisher are called up for the first time.Lees, 28, captained the Lions squad in Australia and has shown great potential in the County Championship over the past few years with Durham and previously Yorkshire. He scored 625 runs in last year’s Championship campaign, with a highest score of 129.The 24-year-old Fisher took 20 wickets for Yorkshire last season at an average of 19.65 from County Championship matches. Alongside the new additions to the squad, the Lancashire duo of Saqib Mahmood and Matthew Parkinson will be aiming to make their Test debut in the Caribbean having featured in previous squads.Surrey wicketkeeper Ben Foakes returns to the squad for the first time in under a year when he played the fourth Test in Ahmedabad last March against India.Eight players – Anderson, Dom Bess, Sam Billings, Broad, Burns, Buttler, Hameed and Malan – who featured in the recent Ashes series, have been axed.Strauss added: “With the start of a new cycle, it has allowed the selection panel to refresh the Test squad with a particular focus on competing away from home.

2/9/2022,"Barcelona’s chief executive Ferran Reverter has resigned after seven months, just as the club are expecting to announce a €280m (£236m) deal with Spotify for the title rights on the redeveloped Camp Nou and shirt sponsorship. The agreement with the music platform is understood to be worth that over three years, with the men’s and women’s team carrying the company’s logo on their shirt. Spotify would also become the first holders of the title rights – known as a “surname” – for the stadium.  The deal would come into effect this summer when Barcelona’s contracts with their primary sponsor, Rakuten, and secondary sponsor, Beko, end. The Rakuten shirt deal was worth €55m a season. Barcelona would not comment on the new agreement which is expected to be announced this week. The club said that Reverter had resigned for “personal family reasons” but the timing was striking and the Catalan radio show Què T’hi Jugues suggested that he had had a series of disagreements with the president, Joan Laporta, the latest of which was the Spotify deal and his attempts to secure a secondary sponsor for the sleeve. Reverter had been at the heart of negotiations over primary and secondary sponsorship deals, with reports suggesting that he had conversations with a cryptocurrency company only to encounter opposition from the club’s board. Spotify faces a controversy after the singer Neil Young demanded the removal of his catalogue from the platform because of the continued presence of the podcaster Joe Rogan, whom he accuses of spreading misinformation. Reverter, the former CEO of the German retailers Mediamarkt, had been Laporta’s first “signing” as president of Barcelona. He arrived with the backing of the vice-president Eduard Romeu, whose energy company Audax had provided the economic guarantees that allowed Laporta to take the presidency. Reverter was at the heart of the administration’s attempts to resolve the financial crisis it inherited, Laporta last week saying that €159m had been cut off the wage bill. Reverter and Romeu were among those most opposed to Lionel Messi continuing at the club at a time when the wage bill was more than 100% of annual income. He was a firm defender of the super league project and the Espai Barça stadium redevelopment, for which the club took out a €1.5bn loan from Goldman Sachs. A statement from Barcelona thanked Reverter for a series of “targets met”, including the “restructuring of the debt, the approval by the fans of Espai Barça, the reduction of the salary mass, and agreements with new sponsors”. He will continue until a replacement is found.",Sport/Football,Barcelona close to £236m Spotify deal that includes Camp Nou naming rights,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/08/barcelona-close-to-236m-spotify-deal-that-includes-camp-nou-naming-rights
2/9/2022,"The singer and guitarist Jimmy Johnson, who has died aged 93, was one of the wonders – if sometimes half-hidden – of the blues world, both for his elegant, passionate singing and for his clean-cut, inventive guitar playing. In the 1960s and 70s he established himself in the clubs of Chicago, one of the generation of musicians such as Magic Sam, Otis Rush and Freddie King who would reshape the blues for a new world and new audiences. He maintained a distinguished position in that milieu for more than 60 years, and was described by Bruce Iglauer, founder of Alligator Records, which released some of his material, as “a searing guitar player and intense, distinctive singer whose music had the deep emotional impact of the best blues”.  For all that, Johnson never attained the celebrity of Sam or Rush, nor of other, sometimes lesser, talents, and to the frustration of his admirers he often seemed to be set in the role of Chicago’s best-kept secret. His reputation was probably higher in Europe than in the US, and many of his recordings, especially in the 80s and 90s, were done for companies in France or Germany. Whether through luck or care, Johnson outlived most of his contemporaries and continued to sing and play into his 90s. He appeared regularly at the Chicago Blues festival, most recently in 2019, and during the coronavirus pandemic he gave livestreamed Facebook performances from his home every week. On his 92nd birthday his broadcast drew an audience of more than 80,000 – once again, much of it overseas. He was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, the second of the 10 children of Verlie Smith and Sam Thompson. By his own account he had little schooling. “Most days we worked from sunup until sundown,” he said. “At the age of eight I was working in the fields, picking, chopping and ploughing cotton and helping to tend to the farm animals.” He sang in church as a boy and later in gospel groups in Memphis and Chicago, to where he moved in his 20s at the suggestion of an uncle. Working as a welder, he saved to bring his mother and siblings to the city, and in 1956 bought his first guitar. Three years later he played his first gig, under the surname of Johnson, which his younger brother Syl, an accomplished soul singer, had taken for his professional moniker.) Shortly afterwards he returned home to tell his soon-t0-be wife, Sherry (nee Ewing), that he had been fired from his welding work and would now have to earn his living from music. During the 60s Johnson found most of his playing opportunities in gospel and soul music, and in leading house bands at various Chicago venues, where he backed singers such as Otis Clay and Denise LaSalle. His first album-length studio recording was made for the independent producer Ralph Bass in 1977. The blues writer Peter Guralnick, who happened to be at the session, wrote in his book Lost Highway: “Johnson plays with the same delicacy and feeling that you hear in the clubs, his somewhat thin, sensitive voice always retaining a brittle edge.” But the tapes were shelved for years, until finally acquired by a British company, and Johnson’s first released LPs – on a French label – were live recordings made in 1975–77 at the Chicago clubs Ma Bea’s and the Golden Slipper. In 1978 Johnson was showcased on the first volume of Alligator Records’ revelatory series Living Chicago Blues, performing songs such as Feel Like Breaking Up Somebody’s Home that were perfectly suited to his soulful style. The albums Johnson’s Whacks (1979) and North/South (1982), made for the other significant Chicago blues label, Delmark, gave him the chance to put aside covers and use his own material, such as The Twelve Bar Blues, with its punning lines such as “I drank a dozen Buds but I don’t feel any wiser”. Although he handled received ideas with respect, in his compositions he set original scenes and described them in witty and vivid language. His career was interrupted by a car accident in 1988 in which two members of his band died. He returned to music a few years later, and I’m a Jockey (1993) won a Blues Music Award as a comeback album, while in 2002 Two Johnsons Are Better Than One! was a fraternal get-together with Syl, as well as being an intriguing map of two roads travelled. Another brother, Mack – who kept the name Thompson – followed them into music, playing bass guitar with Sam. Over the years Jimmy won several other Blues Music Awards, was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2016, and in 2021 was named Blues Artist of the Year by Living Blues magazine. His last album was Every Day Of Your Life (2019). Mack died in 1991, and Syl just a few days after Jimmy, on 6 February. Jimmy is survived by Sherry, their children, LaSaundra, Geraldine, Lorenzo, Eric and Jimmy, and sisters Vivian and Marva.

2/9/2022,"A sophisticated encrypted phone messaging system was used to supply a firearm for a murder and to hatch a failed plot to carry out another killing, an Old Bailey jury has been told at the trial of two men whose secret communications were intercepted. The so-called EncroChat service was allegedly used to procure a firearm to carry out a murder in London in 2020 and to plan another that did not take place.  Paul Fontaine, 36, was a “criminal middleman” who supplied weapons, drugs and counterfeit currency to other professional criminals, communicating with them on encrypted phones, said the prosecuting counsel, Kevin Dent QC. In this role, he conspired with others to transfer a firearm that was used in the murder of Abdullahi Mahmoud in March 2020, the court heard. He is charged with conspiracy to supply a firearm in connection with that murder. Fontaine is also alleged to have conspired with Frankie Sinclair, 34, to murder a rival of Sinclair’s called Keiron Hassan, and others, in the course of a dispute between Sinclair and a rival group. Sinclair allegedly sought the assistance of Fontaine to procure a handgun and ammunition to carry out a “revenge murder” after his mother’s home in Cardiff had come under attack. Both men are charged with conspiracy to murder. During the messaging, Fontaine communicated his involvement in the murder of Mahmoud, indicating he had earlier arranged to supply a firearm for a murder, the court heard. Sinclair was alleged to have taken possession of a Walther PPK handgun and ammunition in order to kill Hassan. Sinclair was involved in a dispute with a rival group that had escalated and led to his mother’s house being targeted by three men armed with firearms and a crossbow in March 2020. He believed that group of men to include or have been directed by Keiron Hassan and he engaged Fontaine’s services to carry out the murder of the attackers, the court heard. The court heard that Hassan was soon afterwards taken into custody and thus the attack could not take place. Sinclair was said to have also been involved in supplying class A drugs, offences for which he has already pleaded guilty. “EncroChat devices are like mobile phones but they are highly secure,” said Dent. “They offer higher levels of security. An EncroChat device can only communicate with another EncroChat device, not the kind of mobile you could use for cinema tickets or to order a pizza … each device is assigned a unique handle or name.” The court heard that Sinclair’s handle was “Nudetrain” and Fontaine’s was“Usualwolf”. The handsets cost more than £1,000 and were not available in shops. “It is an expensive product but an extremely useful device for organised criminals to use in order to be able to communicate with others without anyone outside being able to find out,” the court heard. Although law enforcement agencies had later been able to access the information available on the devices, “at the time users thought that no one else could. We suggest that they [Sinclair and Fontaine] were pretty upfront and explicit, there was no beating about the bush.” In one communication, Fontaine had indicated that he was short of firearms “because part of his own stock had been used in a murder”. In another message Sinclair asked Fontaine for “sweets”, which the court was told meant bullets, which cost £10 each. “Need them sweets ain’t looking to waste none,” said another message. A further one read “I need 2 savages so can do 2 glides in 1 wA u saying I pay them,” which the prosecution suggested was Sinclair’s request to Fontaine for extra manpower and cars to assist him. Another reference in messages was to “duppy”, a slang term for ghost, indicating that death would be involved. Sinclair supposedly referred to the handgun in the messages as a “James Bond ting”. “They were both also involved in other criminal enterprises,” the court heard. “Paul Fontaine, as part of his role in serving the needs of criminals, was also involved in the supply of heroin and counterfeit currency.” Both men deny conspiracy to murder and all other charges.

2/9/2022,"My friend Ian Stone, who has died aged 89, was among the first BBC cameramen to evolve a fresh style of documentary filming in the 1960s and 70s, using lighter-weight cameras, sometimes hand-held, and filming in natural light. He shot notable documentaries for strands including Panorama, The World About Us, 40 Minutes and Horizon. He worked at the BBC for 30 years. So successful was Ian that Clive James wrote in the Observer that a 1977 observational Panorama programme, shot in a school, must have been set up, because it was so steady and sharp – “otherwise the cameraman must have been the greatest since Raoul Coutard”. Ian had shot the whole unrehearsed film with a hand-held Eclair camera; Clive James apologised.  Ian was born in Caerphilly, south Wales, the son of David Stone, a farmer, and his wife, Mary (nee Coggins). His interest in film-making was first aroused by a documentary about his father’s sheep-dog trials. After Caerphilly grammar school, he studied English at Cardiff University, graduating in 1954. During his national service he became a sergeant in the Education Corps, and seemed destined for teaching. But by chance he saw a BBC advertisement for cameramen, applied, and was taken on as a trainee, working at first for the Farming Unit in Birmingham. Ian shot notable films for factual series such as Year of the French, The Human Brain, and Americans – but some of his most memorable work was for single documentaries, such as Public School, a candid film about Westminster school, which aired in 1979 on BBC1 with an audience of 12.5 million. He came to prominence as chief cameraman for Bird’s-Eye View, for BBC2, a series of helicopter films shot between 1969 and 1971, in which he pioneered spectacular techniques of aerial photography, perched precariously in an open doorway with a small camera mount. Over the years we worked on many films together, and remained lifelong friends. Ian enjoyed filming, with its opportunities for far-flung travel – especially to Japan, Pakistan, Indonesia and the US – and enjoyed fun in company after work, be it at a restaurant, a skating rink or a funfair. His assistants loved him for his kindness, integrity and warmth, and many stayed close to him. He retired from the BBC staff in 1988 to go freelance. Outside his work, Ian had a passion for elaborate DIY house improvement, exercising his skills in plumbing, electrics and roofing during many house moves. He renovated a barn in Brittany, then, after retirement in 1991, moved to France, a country he loved – enjoying the beaches, the food, and visits from old colleagues. Ian is survived by Stella (nee Simons), whom he married in 1956, their daughter Siân and grandson, Luc.

2/9/2022,"The Parthenon marbles have been a source of tension between Greece and England for 200 years (The Parthenon marbles belong in Greece – so why is restitution so hard to swallow?, 5 February). Lord Byron urged their return in the 1820s. Last year, Unesco did the same. Opinion polls consistently show that a majority of Britons favour repatriation. Unfortunately, the debate has become a zero-sum game, with the suggestion that there can be but a single winner. Last month, at an event at Keats House in London, I tried to change that calculus: speaking alongside the Greek ambassador, I offered to reconstruct the marbles held by the British Museum. The copies, carved from the same stone, would be virtually identical to the originals.  The museum justifies its retention of the marbles on the ground that this allows visitors to see Phidias’s masterpiece in the context of global culture. High-quality reconstructions would serve that purpose just as well. Reconstructions would also acknowledge Britons’ special attachment to the marbles. As the Cast Courts at the Victoria and Albert Museum have proved, people can fall in love with copies. The Institute for Digital Archaeology’s reconstructed Arch of Palmyra, unveiled on Trafalgar Square in 2016 before travelling to other cities around the world, has attracted more than 15 million visitors. Many have found the reconstruction more compelling than the original, embodying as it does a powerful gesture of international goodwill. The histories of Greece and Britain are deeply intertwined, and it is a pity that a prominent exhibit in our national museum has become a perpetual symbol of discord between the two countries. In the mid-19th century, Britain returned the Ionian islands to Greece to celebrate the coronation of the late Duke of Edinburgh’s grandfather as King of Greece. Perhaps the Queen’s diamond jubilee provides a fitting occasion to restore a treasured relic of antiquity to her late husband’s homeland.Roger MichelInstitute for Digital Archaeology  Charlotte Higgins explains the three legal criteria by which items can be deaccessioned from the British Museum’s collection under the 1963 British Museum Act and its amendments. It is now time for another amendment, which could be set it motion by a pro-repatriation MP. Adding a fourth criterion, for the deaccession of items for repatriation, would allow for ethical decisions to be made independently by trustees. The British Museum’s vaults are huge, and other items can be brought into the daylight without diminishing the value of the museum to visitors.Anna WatsonLondon  One of the many reasons why Britain has refused to return the marbles to Greece is Neil MacGregor’s suggestion that the British Museum is a “universal” museum based on Enlightenment principles, “a place of the world, for the world”, as Charlotte Higgins states. This reasoning looks particularly specious given the catastrophic fall in the number of school trips to the UK from Europe and other countries post-Brexit.Alan GavurinLondon  Please can we have a moratorium on discussion about the return of the Parthenon marbles until the French return the Bayeux tapestry, (which was made in England, according to the experts)?Richard PickvanceLondon",Arts/Art and design,Parthnon' marbles’ return would be a lovely jubilee gesture | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/08/parthenon-marbles-return-would-be-a-lovely-jubilee-gesture
2/9/2022,"By a strange coincidence, I, like Kerry Hudson (I lived through fuel poverty as a child. This is how it really feels, 7 February), lived in Aberdeen with a baby in an “unfurnished, uncarpeted council flat that no one wanted on a street no one would choose to live on”, although I had a husband who was a student. We had only the one coal fire. It was 1980. We had coal delivered in sacks, but we had no coal bunker so it was all emptied out in a corner on the floor of the bedroom. In winter, we got dressed under the blankets and laid and lit the fire. To warm up the kitchen, we put the gas oven on and left the door open for a few minutes. I would get baby advice books from the library and they would recommend a certain temperature for “the nursery” – it would make me angry. Our bedrooms were unheated, even in Aberdeen in the winter, as they had been all my life growing up in Edinburgh.  Your baby was dressed in a woollen vest, socks, babygrow, two woollen matinee coats (long cardigans), hat, gloves and a fleece all-in-one sleeping suit – and that was to go to bed. With blankets on top. Since this was exactly what I had experienced as I was growing up, I didn’t really think about it much. I had a bath once a week and in between “topped and tailed” at the bathroom sink, using a kettle of hot water. My life fortunately was much more stable than Hudson’s. A few years later we moved and had a house with central heating. My parents never did have a house with central heating, even though they could afford it; they had a gas fire and a paraffin heater, and always slept in an unheated bedroom.Jane WheelaghanSt Albans, Hertfordshire  Since reading Kerry Hudson’s article I have been thinking about ablutions, one small part of her very affecting account.

2/9/2022,"The former Yorkshire chairmen Richard Hutton and Robin Smith have been heavily criticised for, respectively, failing to co-operate with the Professional Cricketers’ Association’s initial investigation into the racist abuse described by Azeem Rafiq, and for holding up progress. In a meeting of the the digital, culture, media and sport select committee Julian Metherell, the PCA’s non-executive chairman, accused Hutton, who resigned as Yorkshire’s chairman last November, of failing to respond to repeated attempts to make contact before eventually providing “nothing that was in any way helpful”.  Meanwhile an interview with the Yorkshire Post given last week by Smith, who was chairman between 2002 and 2005 and again between 2018 and 2020, in which Lord Patel’s appointment as chair last year and his subsequent reforms were dismissed as “not valid”, was described as “abhorrent and totally obstructive”. The PCA had been called to defend their record after Rafiq described their initial response to his accusations as “incredibly inept”. Rob Lynch, their chief executive, admitted that “in this dispute with Yorkshire we did not meet the standards we would have wished to”, and said the organisation had since apologised to Rafiq. Metherell detailed his contact with Yorkshire over Rafiq’s allegations. “I personally tried to contact Mr Hutton on a number of occasions, both by email and telephone, and those calls and those emails went unanswered until I sent a note to Mr Hutton to say we were under increasing pressure to comment and we would be forced to go public and say Yorkshire were not returning any of our calls,” he said. “Mr Hutton did then get back to me, but nothing we received from Yorkshire at that time was in any way helpful. One of our failings at the PCA is we placed far too much confidence in Yorkshire and the ECB.” Julian Knight, the Conservative MP and chair of the DCMS committee, asked the PCA’s representatives to comment on Smith’s more recent intervention, which he summarised as a case of “individuals holding up progress for their own very particular reasons”. Unconvinced by Lynch’s initial response that he was “not across the detail” but it seemed “extremely sad”, he sought further comment from Metherell. “We only know what we read in the press but if [the report] is accurate it is abhorrent, it’s totally obstructive and frankly these are some of the great barriers we face in trying to make cricket more inclusive,” Metherell said. “These minorities cannot prevail, they won’t win and with your support we have to drive this out of the game.” Metherell also revealed that the PCA would be consulting Rafiq before drawing up a code of conduct surrounding issues of discrimination. “There is a clear code of conduct on gambling and drugs, and it is zero tolerance,” he said. “We don’t have that today on discrimination. We have to have that, and that is something we look forward to working with Azeem on in the near future.” After the hearing Rafiq tweeted: “Watching today’s session has been a refreshing experience. To hear someone in the game show leadership in the manner Julian Metherell has gives me some hope for the future. He’s clearly someone that should be considered heavily for the ECB chairman’s role.” While praising the current Derbyshire dressing room Anuj Dal, the 25-year-old who was elected the PCA’s vice-chair last year, described his own reaction to Rafiq’s evidence. “I was pretty heartbroken,” he said. “Not only because of what he had experienced but because a lot of what he said hit home for me personally. At times in my career I have had to face issues I felt uncomfortable with, that I felt hadn’t been dealt with in the correct way. “There were instances as I was growing up when Asian players were stereotyped as being lazy. I remember specific hand gestures that were made for players of colour, and also comments that were made while senior members of staff were laughing along, and that to me was heartbreaking. I didn’t want to be seen as a troublemaker, and I was in a position where I had to brush things under the carpet and get on with it. I think we’ve seen there are issues within the game as a whole.

2/9/2022,"Alumpen, headless couple have sex in a vitrine. The woman has flung her arm over the man but the arm is a strapped-on prosthesis, the hand a metal pincer, cast over his lumbering back. Both figures are made of stuffed black fabric and make a bulbous silhouette behind the glass. Go round the end and you can see his balls and stitched black anus. They’re at it again in another vitrine. This time the woman has an articulated prosthetic leg, its calf a nasty paint-chipped pink ending in a horribly delicate shoe. It is a miserable thing, the mark of some kind of psychic wound dragged too far into adulthood. There are vitrines everywhere, and sewn-together upholstered heads, and figures and legs dangling from the ceiling or hung out on stands. Ideas strung together by a thread, thoughts unspooling and reconnecting. Bourgeois’s art leads inevitably to psychoanalytic interpretation. She thought about Freud a lot, but hers was not a systematic appropriation. Her entire life and the things around her became her material. I don’t think she had a choice. Recounting the same old stories – her father’s affair with her nanny, her mother’s death, her relationships with her children, and rummaging about in the lumber rooms of memory and fixations – she kept coming up with marvellous, scary and provocative things.  Bodies reappear everywhere. There’s sex and motherhood, replays of her traumas and jealousies in everything she did. Bourgeois could be funny, bitter and surprising at every turn. The Hayward’s architecture and the variety of its spaces is ideal for her work. It is almost 12 years since her death at the age of 99, and 15 since her Tate Modern retrospective. The Woven Child focuses on the last two decades of her long life. Increasingly agoraphobic, she rarely strayed from home. But the work kept coming. This is a wonderful, often surprising and sometimes frightening exhibition. Heads look back, staring at no one. Some are open-mouthed as though about to speak or gasp. Some might smile or sing – it is hard to tell. Some heads, Janus-like, wear several faces. Or several heads sprout from one neck. Other heads hang inverted, like decapitations, in one of her glass and wire-mesh cells. Elsewhere, another head represents her brother Pierre, institutionalised for much of his life, and with only one ear. Ratty old fabrics – raddled, repaired and disintegrating on their hangers – are suspended in one of her constructed rooms, above a precise model of her childhood home outside Paris. Delicate, diaphanous old white camisoles and chemises, bits of underwear and a pale pink blouse, along with a little black dress, hang from cow bones on a stand, like a carousel. On another stand, a smock-like dress has a long red tail trailing on the floor. Little sewn-together figures arch their backs or proffer their rears, which have become breasts. Their feet wear little high heels. A rudimentary body is covered in puffed-up French berets, like a cluster of bloated mushrooms. Body parts keep switching around. Another body twists into a spiral, as though caught in the dizzying whirlwind of frantic childhood play. There’s an element of play, too, in the way Bourgeois piles up little cushions into precarious towers, or uses bobbins, needles and thread to make sculptures that recall the cosmographies of Jean Miró. Bourgeois kept working right to the end, drawing, writing and sewing, constructing her cell-like lairs, doing, redoing and going over old wounds, ancient jealousies, anger and rage. It all kept resurfacing and driving her on. The stories she told herself and the dramas her art enacted were of a piece. She never threw anything away and she kept on accumulating. She used her own old clothes as material, and her mother’s, which she’d saved and kept in the basement of her brownstone in Chelsea, New York. The smell of the clothes and the associations they triggered – as well as the metaphorical associations of sewing and slicing, suturing and ripping, joining and mending, patching and repairing – were all part of it. The Woven Child is, inevitably, not just about textiles, but a way into Bourgeois’s later work in the light of her use of them. A giant steel spider stands over a cell whose walls are partially covered with ratty old fragments of tapestry. Another, smaller spider clambers over a woman in a chair. Is it the spider or the woman who spins and spins in her brocade-covered chair? Unpicking, reassembling and sewing together striped materials, Bourgeois made images of web after web, in beautiful later works. At the centre of some webs, there are flowers. She continued to draw spiders all the while. The spider, she said, was a repairer and a guardian. If you bash its web, the spider will patiently start another. She kept starting again, right to the end.
