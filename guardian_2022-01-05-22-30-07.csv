1/5/2022,"Forecasters say “thundersnow” that could disrupt travel and cause power outages is expected to hit the UK as a band of sleet, hail and snow showers passes through the country. The Met Office issued three yellow warnings for dangerous weather conditions, including lightning strikes from isolated thunderstorms and as much as 10cm of snow falling on the highest ground, from 10am on Thursday until 11am on Friday across Scotland, Wales and northern England.In the Scottish Highlands, from 8pm on Thursday until 11am on Friday there will be “frequent sleet, hail and snow showers may lead to some disruption to travel during Thursday night and Friday morning”, with longer journey times expected for some roads and railways, icy patches and possible brief power outages.In the south of Scotland, including Glasgow, and in parts of Northern Ireland and in England north of Manchester , snow will cause some travel disruption from 10am until 4pm on Thursday, according to a separate warning. The Met Office said there would up to two hours of snow in many areas with a risk of temporary slushy accumulations above 100 to 200 metres and strong winds leading to temporary blizzard conditions in higher areas.  The Met Office said Thursday would be dry and cold to start across the UK, but with a band of cloud, wind and rain spreading eastwards, with this falling as snow in some areas although this will not remain for long.After an unseasonably warm few weeks, including a record-breaking New Year’s Day in which temperatures of 16C were recorded in London, the UK’s first widespread frost of the winter is expected to hit in the coming days, with overnight temperatures set to fall below freezing on Wednesday.The wet and snowy conditions will give way to sunnier and milder weather over the weekend, especially in the east, albeit with some outbreaks of blustery showers.Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge said: “At the moment we’ve got a ridge of high pressure leading to clear skies. Into the early hours of tomorrow morning we’ll start to see a weather front approach from the west, bearing in mind conditions will have been intensely cold overnight with frost and freezing fog in southern parts of England. We’ll get this frontal band of precipitation working east, then as that cold air bumps into the weather front moving in we’ll see a line of snow along that front.”He said “thundersnow” would be caused by the difference between the cold front arriving from the west, reaching the ground that has been warmed by unseasonable temperatures. He added that the conditions were driven by the same meteorological conditions as storms in summer but that it can sound distinct, as it is muffled by snow.",News/UK news,"UK weather: ‘thundersnow’ to fall from Thursday, warns Met Office",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/uk-weather-thundersnow-to-fall-from-thursday-warns-met-office
1/5/2022,"The annual Golden Globes ceremony has been unable to find a broadcasting partner or any celebrities willing to present or collect its awards after a Hollywood boycott over its diversity and ethics scandal, resulting in a pared-down event with the emphasis on philanthropy. According to Variety, the Globes’ talent bookers have failed to persuade any big Hollywood figures to attend the 2022 edition of the awards ceremony, a hitherto glittering annual event that traditionally kicked off the lucrative awards season. In March 2021 more than 100 public relations firms announced they would withdraw cooperation with the Globes, a series of high-profile Hollywood figures, including Tom Cruise and Scarlett Johansson, made stinging public criticisms, and TV network NBC cancelled its broadcast of the 2022 edition.  In a statement on its website, the Golden Globes parent organisation Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) said that the ceremony would go ahead on Sunday at the Beverly Hilton hotel, and planned to “shine a light on the long-established philanthropy work of the HFPA, showcasing a range of grantees during the program”. The HFPA also said event will also “discuss” the Reimagine Coalition, an initiative announced in October 2021 and set up in conjunction with civil rights group the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to “increase diversity, equity, and inclusion across the global entertainment industry”. No press will be allowed inside the ceremony, and no red carpet will take place. Audience members will be required to wear masks, and follow strict Covid guidelines including proof of vaccination and negative tests. It has yet to be announced whether the ceremony will be livestreamed. The HFPA has been engulfed in crisis since the LA Times ran an exposé on the eve of the 2021 Golden Globes, accusing the organisation of a lack of diversity in its voting membership as well as “ethical lapses” in the way it conducted its business.

1/5/2022,"Tony Blair’s former defence secretary Geoff Hoon has claimed he was told to burn a memo from the attorney general that cast doubt on the legality of the Iraq war. In revelations that critics say cast further doubt on the decision to award the former prime minister a knighthood, Hoon recalled in extracts from his recently published memoir that Blair’s chief of staff had instructed him to burn the document.  Hoon wrote in his memoir, See How They Run, that he had had been under pressure from Mike Boyce, the chief of defence staff, to provide him with clear legal direction that his forces could take action in Iraq, in lieu of a UN resolution authorising force, the Daily Mail reported. He claims to have received a copy of complex advice from the then attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, which was “very long and very detailed legal opinion”. He wrote: “I was sent a copy from Downing St under conditions of considerable secrecy. I was told that it was for my eyes only and that I should not discuss its contents with anyone else. I had no idea who else had received a copy.” Hoon said the advice was “not an easy read” and concluded that the Iraq invasion would be lawful only if the prime minister believed that it was in the UK’s national interest to do so. “It was not exactly the ringing endorsement that the chief of the defence staff was looking for, and in any event, I was not strictly allowed to show it to him or even discuss it with him,” he wrote. “Moreover, when my principal private secretary, Peter Watkins, called Jonathan Powell in Downing St and asked what he should now do with the document, he was told in no uncertain terms that he should ‘burn it’.” Hoon said the document was not burned. “I agreed that we should lock the document securely into an MoD safe to which only he had access. For all I know it is probably still there.” Powell told the Daily Mail he had not ordered the advice to be burned and described it as a separate “minute” that he had asked Hoon to destroy on Goldsmith’s request. In his memoir, Hoon also describes the humiliation of being sacked as defence secretary two years later, saying Blair phoned him to tell him the news rather than meet face-to-face. More than 700,000 people have now signed a petition to rescind Blair’s knighthood, awarded by the Queen in the new year honours list. But the decision to award him the honour was defended by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who said on Tuesday it was “not a thorny issue” to give the award to someone who had served a long term as prime minister. “I understand there are strong views on the Iraq war. There were back at the time and there still are, but that does not detract from the fact that Tony Blair was a very successful prime minister of this country and made a huge difference to the lives of millions of people in this country,” Starmer said.",News/Politics,Geoff Hoon ‘told to burn memo that said Iraq invasion could be illegal’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/05/geoff-hoon-told-to-burn-memo-that-said-iraq-invasion-could-be
1/5/2022,"The UK government is to investigate the health risks posed by tattoo inks after the EU introduced a ban on a range of substances used in pigments on the grounds they are hazardous. The ban, which came into force on Monday, has caused a crisis in the tattoo industry across the bloc, with trade associations warning it will “criminalise” artists and threaten the entire sector, which is already reeling from closures through the pandemic lockdowns.  The law does not apply to the UK as it came into effect after Brexit was sealed in January 2020 but it poses one of the first tests for the UK’s approach to regulation of laws affecting consumers since it achieved independence from the bloc. The law limits the use of certain chemicals the EU says are hazardous, with some linked to cancer, reproductive difficulties and skin irritation, and which are contained in mixtures for tattoo inks and permanent makeup. It is estimated that 54 million people across the EU have tattoos and the industry had a year to prepare for the ban. The tattoo artist Tin-Tin, who heads the French tattoo industry union SNAT, told Reuters the new rules would drive people to parlours that do not respect the legislation. “It’s ridiculous. It’s like taking the flour from a bakery, it’s as stupid as that. If we don’t have any colours or ink to work with, what are we going to work with?” he said. Dolores Murray, who owns Wild Cat Ink in Dublin, told RTÉ radio in Ireland the ban would affect about 4,000 substances used in tattoo inks, including isopropyl alcohol, a disinfecting lotion used in the process. She read a statement from the European Society of Tattoo Pigment Research that said the ban was not argued sufficiently and would lead to the criminalisation of tattoo artists. “What we are looking for is a little time to try and get this whole mess sorted out,” she said. A worker at one tattoo parlour in London said they had heard about the ban but had been given “no information” as to whether or not it applied in the post-Brexit UK. EU laws up to January 2020 were incorporated into domestic law but those agreed since are not. However, the UK said it would take the scientific research in the EU into consideration. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which is responsible for the UK’s registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (UK Reach), said: “UK Reach allows the UK to make its own decisions on the regulation of chemicals that are based on the best available scientific evidence, ensuring that chemicals remain safely used and managed. “The government has asked the Health and Safety Executive [HSE] to prepare a dossier to review the risk posed by certain substances in tattoo inks and consider the case for introducing any restrictions,” said the spokesperson. The UK government asked the HSE last March to consider the case for imposing any restrictions. Defra said this was because the ink in tattoos could sometime cause health effects, most commonly skin reactions, such as irritation or sensitisation. It added that the restriction proposal “will consider … but is not limited to, substances that can cause cancer, are dangerous to reproduction, skin sensitisers and irritants”. It would introduce its draft restriction dossiers in spring 2022, after which there would be a public consultation, it said. Defra added that if evidence showed there was an unacceptable risk to human health, it would impose bans on certain inks.",Lifestyle/Fashion,UK to investigate tattoo ink health risks after EU ban,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/05/uk-investigate-tattoo-ink-health-risk-after-eu-ban
1/5/2022,"Growing up, trips to the theatre for me involved squinting at the stage, unable to follow what was happening. Being partially sighted, plays have felt out of my reach. But now here I am standing on the stage at Curve theatre in Leicester, running my fingers along the delicate gold sequins of a costume for A Chorus Line. There are around a dozen of us at this pre-show talk for visually impaired people, which gives us a chance to familiarise ourselves with the performance we’ll be watching in an hour’s time. Before the pandemic, this pre-show talk would have taken the form of a touch tour, where we’d get to feel more of the costumes and set. Today we can only touch two costumes due to Covid safety precautions, but even through the thin gloves we wear, I can feel the texture, the snag of chiffon and sequins, and see details up close. Our guide, Nadine Beasley for Talking Sense Audio Description Services, tells us how the bright lighting in the show’s finale will make these outfits dazzle.  We see several other costumes as Beasley talks us through the rack of leotards and checked shirts, telling us which outfit belongs to which character. She also describes the set and gives us the background to A Chorus Line. Beth Hinton-Lever, who plays Bebe in the show, pops in to introduce herself and gives a helpful description of what she will look like on stage. The talk leaves me with a grounding in the play, the set and its characters, and I feel tentatively hopeful that it’ll help me follow the action. Many theatres offer accessible performances, with adaptations from sign language and captioning to dementia-friendly and relaxed viewings. I asked artist Jamie Hale, who recently directed CRIPtic Pit Party at the Barbican, about theatre access. They told me about some of the barriers they experience, such as lack of wheelchair access, and having to phone to book accessible tickets. While there have been improvements, the inclusion of more disabled people in the industry, Hale says, would increase theatre’s accessibility. Tonight’s performance of A Chorus Line will be audio-described by Beasley, giving a live account of the action, delivered via headsets that still allow us to hear everything happening on stage. Other audience members won’t hear the audio description. We return to the auditorium about 20 minutes before the show. While I fiddle with the volume on my headset, Beasley reads us an audio introduction. She describes the stage layout again, everything from the large mirrors at the back to details such as the 1970s-style red telephone pinned to the left wall. She also runs through the main characters, describing their hair, faces, eyes, clothes and how they carry themselves. It’s a colourful explanation: we learn that the character Mike “moves with a youthful swagger, sporting a cheeky smile” and Sheila “smoulders like a 1930s femme fatale”. Still, I’m nervous about whether I’ll be able to follow the play once it begins. Soon the stage is filled with figures dancing. From my seat three rows from the front, I can see the flow of people moving, and Beasley’s description helps me make sense of it. She explains the choreography throughout the show, the “arms flailing, feet tapping”, “undulating twists”, pirouettes and leaps, characters sashaying across the stage, the shapes they cast with their bodies. It brings their movements to life in my mind. She describes other actions, such as characters stepping forward or leaving the stage, and expressions too – characters’ eyes locking, or them fidgeting nervously. She captures the tenderness of the moment when Zach and Paul hug, describing the warmth of their embrace. I feel the weight of it with the same strength as fully sighted audience members. The commentary feels natural, never distracting from the action or dialogue. I recognise outfits from the pre-show talk, and spot Bebe quickly, remembering how Hinton-Lever described the character’s long red hair. During the finale, my mind goes back to the look and feel of the golden costumes, and how Beasley said they sparkle in the light. One of the hardest things about watching theatre growing up was not being able to tell which character was speaking. When you can’t see people’s lips move, voices hang unaccounted for, detached from physical form. When the pace allows, Beasley says the name of a character before they speak or sing. And this, perhaps more than anything, makes a huge difference for me. For the first time, I’m able to follow a play. And it’s a revelation. I can enjoy theatre! I feel included. I am part of this shared experience. As I leave the auditorium and hand back my headset, I have joyously entered a new world, one I once felt I didn’t belong in but am now excited to explore.",Arts/Stage,Feel the sequins: touch tours and headset hosts are a sensation for visually impaired audiences,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/05/feel-the-sequins-touch-tours-and-headset-hosts-are-a-sensation-for-visually-impaired-audiences
1/5/2022,"The Women’s Championship club Coventry United have avoided liquidation after an agreement in principle to sell the club’s shares was struck at the 11th hour. The businessman Lewis Taylor, the founder and managing director of the energy company Energy Angels, is poised to take over Coventry, who said on 23 December that they were going into voluntary liquidation.  That process, overseen by the accountancy firm BK Plus, was due to be completed on 4 January. But BK Plus said on Wednesday that those instructions were terminated at at 4.52pm that day. Thirty players and staff were due to have their contracts of employment terminated at Coventry, who are halfway through their first season as a fully professional club. Richard Tonks, insolvency practitioner at BK Plus said: “Notice of the liquidation caused understandable disappointment to everyone connected with the club, not least the players and staff. Notice of the proceedings also gathered a lot of external interest and concern, and resulted in offers to try and save the club from parties in the UK and abroad.” Tonks added: “We were pleased to be part of the process resulting in the agreement of heads of terms to sell the company’s shares … Clearly, a sale still needs to be finalised and we remain on hand to support all of the relevant parties with a view to completing a sale as soon as possible.” The Women’s Championship season has been on a winter break but is due to resume this weekend. Taylor, whose company sponsors Wolves Women in the third tier, told Sky Sports News that he had held virtual meetings on New Year’s Day with the manager, Jay Bradford, and the players. “We’ve had a really positive response from the squad,” he said. “We will shore the situation up very quickly and get the players paid for a start.”",Sport/Football,Women’s Championship club Coventry United avoid liquidation at 11th hour,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/womens-championship-club-coventry-united-avoid-liquidation
1/5/2022,"The DP World Tour – the recently rebranded European Tour – will grant permission to players to play in next month’s controversial Saudi International following weeks of intense negotiations. By Monday’s deadline, between 30 and 40 members of the tour had requested releases to play in the Asian Tour-run event near Jeddah, from 3 February. It is sponsored by the Saudi public investment fund and carries huge appearance fees.  Despite speculation relating to the potential banning of European players for competing in the Saudi International, dismissed by some as little more than a cash grab, it is understood they should be informed this week that releases will be granted with conditions attached, relating to future commitments to DP World Tour tournaments. Should those conditions not be met there is scope for disciplinary action, but player power has seemingly won the day. Until now, the Tour has only publicly stated that it is considering each player’s application on merit. The Saudi International has publicised a field including the likes of Paul Casey, Tommy Fleetwood, Sergio García, Tyrrell Hatton, Shane Lowry, Henrik Stenson, Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood. All required DP World Tour grace. It remains to be seen how seriously, if at all, Stenson’s ongoing Saudi involvement harms his aspirations of being Europe’s 2023 Ryder Cup captain. Whether or not top golfers are independent traders or bound by membership criteria of tours has been the subject of much debate. The tournament was once the domain of the then-European Tour and prior to Saudi Arabia’s attempts to make significant inroads into the professional game, seeing them cold-shouldered both by that body and the PGA Tour. Saudi Arabia’s hefty financial commitment to golf has seen Greg Norman hired as head of an investment group, which will spearhead lucrative events on the Asian Tour and has aspirations of a breakaway league. Given the finances on offer, player heads have been turned. The PGA Tour earlier confirmed members could play in the Saudi International if conditions were met, specific to the future staging of the Farmers Insurance Open if played on the same date. There was then an expectancy Europe would follow suit – the Tours have a strategic alliance – but the situation was less straightforward for an organisation which seeks tournament commitments from players in umpteen countries. In theory, the DP World Tour also has more to fear in regards to a talent drain towards a Saudi-backed scheme. It is also expected that the DP World Tour has granted a small number of releases pursued by members wanting to feature in the Singapore Open, which sits directly against this month’s Abu Dhabi Championship.",Sport/Sport,European players granted permission to compete in Saudi International ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/european-players-granted-permission-to-compete-in-saudi-international-golf
