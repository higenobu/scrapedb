1/3/2022,"Michelle de Kretser’s slyly intelligent sixth novel pairs two first-person narratives. One takes place in a dystopian near-future Melbourne, where Lyle, an immigrant father of two, is employed by the state to write sinister-sounding “evaluations” nominating fellow migrants for arrest and repatriation; the other half of the book is set in 1981 and follows Lili, a 22-year-old Australian working as a teaching assistant in France, prior to postgraduate literary study in Oxford. It’s typical of De Kretser’s sophistication that she leaves the link between these narratives entirely up to you – even the order in which they are to be read is left to the individual reader, given the book’s reversible, Kindle-defying two-way design. I plunged straight into Lili’s intimately conversational reminiscence of running with a circle of young Europeans attached to her Montpellier lycée, in particular Minna, who takes a year out of art school in London to tag along with her boyfriend Nick. Lili struggles for cash, has problems with her landlord and neighbour, and faces everyday racism (her family emigrated to Australia from Asia, like De Kretser, who was born in Sri Lanka). She can’t help but fall for Minna and Nick’s rackety aura of entitled glamour, not least when she learns that Nick is at work on a novel, something it never occurred to her she could do, even as an aspiring scholar under the spell of Simone de Beauvoir.  As the three knock around together, Lili’s story unfolds as a coming-of-age vignette portraying the lonely restlessness of unfocused sexual desire and shapeless creative ambition. Regular moments of comedy erupt, especially when Lili joins Minna en route to Italy to visit John Berger’s mistress (apparently an acquaintance of Minna’s mother), where various mid-trip lunch options are rejected as bourgeois until Minna alights on a suitably authentic workers’ restaurant, only to balk at what’s on the menu. Yet there’s steel, too, in De Kretser’s portrait of the chilly welcome Lili receives having arrived into the bosom of the western culture that has defined her intellectual interests. When Lili’s section ends in a moment of collective rapture at the election of François Mitterrand’s socialist party, there’s an immediate shift in tone for the reader, who then turns the book 180 degrees to begin the plottier, more urgent thread set in Lyle’s Australia. Here there are hoverboards, yes, but three-figure-factor sun cream is the norm, much of Sydney is underwater and Islamic worship is banned as a terrorist activity under a suite of laws targeting minorities. As a civil servant who is also a migrant, Lyle recognises that he’s a hair’s breadth from falling foul of the authoritarian powers he helps enforce. When he speaks of a wind that “cuts as if it’s factory-fresh from Gillette”, it’s a mark of De Kretser’s cleverness just how psychologically acute the line feels, almost as if Lyle is trying too hard to signal his buy-in in order to pass without attracting suspicion. The plot turns on cranked-up domestic strife, as Lyle’s go-getting wife sets out to exploit recent euthanasia legislation to kill off his mother and liquidate her assets to move to a new area better suited to the circles they aspire to. There’s an affinity here with the type of story found in George Saunders’s Tenth of December, whose speakers unwittingly reveal the disturbing norms they have assimilated without question. Much of the energy comes from the way De Kretser lets us piece together the precise nature of her climate-ravaged hellscape, as when Lyle speaks casually of prepping his cattle prod before walking to his car at night.De Kretser’s previous novel, 2018’s The Life to Come, also comprised discrete segments, and as in that book, there’s a certain riddling quality here. While the doomy tendency of Lyle’s segment all but snuffs out the heady sense of possibility captured in Lili’s thread, the book’s overriding sense of anger and alarm also mingles with satirical glee. Even if she obviously has the apocalyptic drift of the present in sight, De Kretser passes on to the reader the inescapable feeling that she’s also having fun, in this engaging amalgam of lament and warning shot.

1/3/2022,"There is no point trying to save if you are burdened by costly debts.  The average easy access savings account offers less than 0.2% interest, while on some borrowing you could be paying in excess of 20%. Aim to pay off expensive credit card, store card or overdraft debts before you think about putting money aside. Everyone should aim to have some cash in an easily accessible savings account to provide a financial safety net if the worst happens. “We all need robust savings to cope with the nasty surprises life tends to throw at us,” says Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. “We should be working towards three to six months’ worth of essential expenses in an easy access account.” Essential expenses should include items such as housing costs, money for food and important bills. Do not be put off by how much this comes to – anything you can put away towards it will help if things do go wrong. Beyond rainy-day savings, you may want to put aside other cash – and having a purpose will motivate you. “Setting a goal and giving it a name can help keep you on track,” says Annabelle Williams, a personal finance specialist at the investment firm Nutmeg. “By attaching meaning to your savings goals, such as a new home, a specific trip, or big purchase, you’re more likely to stick to your savings habit.” Regular savings accounts are a good option for those new to saving. You put aside money each month – usually via a standing order from your current account. These accounts offer some of the best interest rates out there, although the maximum you can tuck away often isn’t that high. If you have a NatWest current account, you can take advantage of its Digital Regular Saver account, which pays a market-leading 3% interest and is, it says, designed to help customers with little or no savings develop a savings habit and build financial capability. However, you can only pay in up to £50 each month. TSB’s Monthly Saver pays 2% and lets you save between £25 and £125 a month – again, you need to have a current account with the bank to open one. Most regular savings accounts run for a year, and the interest is paid at the end of the period. You will then need to shop around for a new account for your lump sum. For those on a low income, the government’s Help to Save account is definitely worth considering. It lets certain people on working tax credit, or receiving universal credit, get a bonus of 50p for every £1 they save over four years. You can put in between £1 and £50 each month, and the most you can earn in four years is £1,200 in bonus money. But paying into this account could affect some people’s eligibility for benefits and how much they get, so read the details carefully before you commit. Then there’s the lifetime Isa, which lets people save for a property or retirement. You can put away up to £4,000 each year until you are 50, and the government will add a 25% bonus to your savings, up to a maximum of £1,000 a year. To open one you must be aged 18 to 39. Several banks are making saving easier by getting you to do it whenever you pay for something. Lloyds Bank has Save the Change. When you buy something with your debit card, if your account is in credit it will round up the amount spent to the nearest pound, and transfer the difference into a nominated Lloyds savings account. “If a purchase is £2.20, the bank will transfer 80p, which could see someone save £5.60 in a week if this is spent every day,” says Rachel Springall at the financial data provider Moneyfacts. The digital bank Chase does the same and deposits the small change into a separate account where it will earn interest at 5% for 12 months. Another technique is to log into your current account, look at the balance and mentally “round it down”, Williams says. “If you have £221.60 until payday, round it down to £210 and move £11.60 into savings. It all adds up over time.” Chip and Plum are just two of the apps that offer “auto-save” features. Every few days the tech does the maths and automatically transfers some of your money into another account, which little by little adds up. Plum’s free option includes auto-saving, while Chip is changing its pricing in mid-January so that standard membership will be free. A budgeting app could also help. Springall suggests Money Dashboard, which automatically categorises spending into “buckets”, such as household bills and groceries – this lets you see what you can afford to save once the essentials are covered. Another budgeting app to check out is Emma, which analyses transactions across accounts and classifies them into spending categories. “Great budgeting starts with careful planning and reliable insights,” its website promises. Some of the best interest rates are offered by fixed-rate savings accounts, where you typically tie up your money for a year or more. Of course, that won’t suit everyone. At the time of writing, you could get about 1.3% on a one-year fixed-rate bond, about 1.6% on a two-year bond, and about 2.1% on a five-year bond. For the latest rates, keep a close eye on Moneyfacts’ tables. If your current account isn’t cutting the mustard, you can get some free cash – enough, perhaps, to kick off a nest egg – by moving it to a new provider. Many banks pay £100-plus if you move to them. Nationwide will give you up to £125 if you are a member and switch to its FlexDirect current account. If you are not yet a member, it is £100. Meanwhile, HSBC is offering £150 if you move to its Advance or Premier accounts. Typically, the money is paid into the current account you have switched to, shortly after the move has been completed. You can then use this cash to start a new savings account or boost an existing one.",Lifestyle/Money,New year’s resolutions: how to get into the habit of saving,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/03/new-years-resolutions-saving-interest-budgeting
1/3/2022,"The first single that I ever boughtOur House by Madness. I was four, so the actual purchase was instigated by my father. He was such a big music fan and wanted to make sure that I knew this was the first song I was buying. I still adore it. In 2020’s lockdown, we did Kitchen Discos: I sang on my Instagram with the kids. After 10 weeks, I chose to close the whole thing with Our House. It celebrates the glory and chaos of family life.  The song that is my karaoke go-toI used to sing Shoop by Salt-N-Pepa, and it’s really fun to do the rap – but when you do a karaoke version, the backing track is quite slow, so you get people looking a bit concerned for you as you trip your way through it. Basically, what you want is a people-pleaser. The one I go to is Faith by George Michael. It just always works. The song I’ve streamed the mostIn the days of having an Alexa, the ruler of the roost is my little one, Mickey. He’s two, and he will get a passion for a song and just play it over and over. For a while it was Let’s Get Loud by Jennifer Lopez; now we’ve progressed to In Da Getto by Skrillex and J Balvin. He likes his heavy dance and his reggaeton as well. It could be a lot worse. The best song to play at a partyIf you want something a bit slinky, Grace Jones – Pull Up to the Bumper. But if you’re trying to entice people to the dancefloor, then I’d probably go disco. Thelma Houston’s Don’t Leave Me This Way is very seductive. The best song to have sex toFor music that’s got that undercurrent of “the man singing wants you to get saucy”, it’s got to be Darling Nikki by Prince – you’re not reading between the lines with that one. Kiss has got lots of flirtation, too. Gett Off would be my top one. The song I want played at my funeralThe one that I’ve said since I was really small is Mickey by Toni Basil – which, I grant you, is going to be quite weird. It came out when I was about two, and it made a big impression on me. It’s got such urgency and passion and it’s a little bit off-kilter. It’s probably not one of the Top 100 hits for funerals, but I think of it as “one of my songs”. The song I pretend to hate that I secretly likeI’m not really afraid of saying what I like. I don’t believe in guilty pleasures. The things I say are my favourites are my favourites. There’s a song that came out by Rufus Wainwright song, Peaceful Afternoon, that’s just so beautiful. I like Everything Now by Arcade Fire, Harmony Hall by Vampire Weekend. The song that is my actual favouriteIt depends what mood you’re in. But some songs are just pretty perfect. Something like Wichita Lineman [by Glen Campbell], it’s a very beautiful song – just glorious. It sounds wistful and captures the purity of wanting to find that connection with someone: you’re sending out your message to them. That’s all of us, isn’t it? Hoping that someone’s on the line.

1/3/2022,"Herschel Walker has Donald Trump’s endorsement in the race for US Senate in Georgia but the former NFL star may be struggling to counter fears from some Republicans that he could damage the party’s chances of taking back a seat lost in 2020, and with it the Senate itself.  In December, the former University of Georgia and Dallas Cowboys running back admitted he does not have a college degree – having repeatedly said that he did. Then, as January began, Walker posted to social media a short but to some bafflingly phrased video. Under the message “a few things to think about as we start the New Year”, Walker attacked policy priorities championed by Democrats including Raphael Warnock, Georgia’s first Black senator who will defend his seat in November. “Build Back Better,” he said, referring to Joe Biden’s domestic spending plan, which targets health and social care and the climate crisis. “You know I’m always thinking: if you want to build back better, first you probably want to control the border, because you want to know who you’re building it for and why. Then you probably want to protect your military, because they’re protecting you against people in other countries that don’t like you.” He then shifted to a broader goal, popular among progressives. “Defunding the police? Bad idea. You want to fund the police so that they have better training, better equipment to protect the law of the land, because you don’t want people doing whatever they want to do.” Then he shifted back again. “Build Back Better. You probably want to become energy independent. Otherwise you’re going to depend on other countries for your livelihood. Build Back Better. You probably want something written, like law of the land, stating that all men are to be treated equal. Oh! We have the constitution. So you probably want to put people in charge who’s going to fight for the constitution. “Just thinking. God bless you.” Burgess Owens, a Republican congressman from Utah who once played safety for the New York Jets and the Oakland Raiders, said Walker “represents what the American dream is all about: hard work, strong character, and love for our great country. I am honored to endorse Herschel for Senate and look forward to working with him!” But critics said the video – and a similarly rambling Fox News appearance – was evidence of Walker’s unsuitability for office. To some, such evidence has piled up ever since Walker signaled a shift into politics. Last summer, the Associated Press said “hundreds of pages of public records tied to Walker’s business ventures and his divorce, including many not previously reported, shed new light on a turbulent personal history that could dog his Senate bid”. The documents, the AP said, “detail accusations that Walker repeatedly threatened his ex-wife’s life, exaggerated claims of financial success and alarmed business associates with unpredictable behavior”. The AP also reported that Walker “has at times been open about his long struggle with mental illness, writing at length in a 2008 book about being diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, once known as multiple personality disorder”. The report also quoted the Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, who said that while Walker “certainly could bring a lot of things to the table … as others have mentioned, there’s also a lot of questions out there”. In the matter of Walker touting a college degree he does not hold, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the false claim was made on a campaign website, “in an online biography advertising Walker’s book, at a campaign rally … and even during his introduction this year at a congressional hearing”. In a statement, Walker said: “I was majoring in criminal justice at UGA when I left to play in the USFL my junior year. After playing with the New Jersey Generals” – a team Trump owned – “I returned to Athens to complete my degree, but life and football got in the way.”",News/US news,Ex-NFL star Herschel Walker posts baffling video promoting US Senate run,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/herschel-walker-video-build-back-better-georgia-republican-senate-run-trump
1/3/2022,"Key Donald Trump loyalists Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn are at the forefront of a drive to expand Trumpist influence at the local level of US politics while forging ahead with efforts aimed at promoting baseless claims that Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory was fraudulent.  The growing drive by Trump’s hardcore allies has spurred election watchdog groups to voice alarm about the threat to democracy posed by Flynn and Bannon – and other Trump acolytes – as they combine debunked claims about election fraud and calls for further 2020 election audits with planning conservative takeovers of official positions that run US elections. The moves come a year after the attack on the Capitol in Washington when a pro-Trump mob invaded the building in an attempt to stop the certification of Biden’s election victory. Flynn and Bannon, using varying paths, have focused new energy on increasing conservative influence by recruiting more allies for key posts at the local and precinct level with an eye on the 2022 and 2024 elections, and building more political alliances on issues such as vaccine requirements and mask mandates. The strategies Flynn and Bannon are deploying overlap those of other conservative outfits, such as the influential youth group Turning Point USA, to expand the pro-Trump base at the precinct level, and work to elect Trump-backed politicians to key posts such as secretary of state in Georgia, Arizona and other battleground states. Flynn and Bannon have separately relied on a mix of non-profit groups, including one backed by the multimillionaire Patrick Byrne, conservative social media outlets favored by the far right like Telegram, and events that convey evangelical Christian messages with political disinformation. Bannon, for instance, has used his War Room podcast to espouse plans for “taking over the Republican party through the precinct committee strategy” and invited would-be candidates to appear as guests. The podcast, which has tens of millions of downloads, has found a large and receptive conservative following. Flynn, meanwhile, touts the adage that “local action has national impact” and has been a star speaker in several key states at “ReAwaken America” events, which are dubbed “health and freedom” conferences and combine evangelical themes with misinformation about the 2020 election and vaccine skepticism. The conservative crusades by Flynn and Bannon come after Trump pardoned them post-election for lying to the FBI and fraud respectively. Bannon and Flynn also were central actors with other Trump loyalists in scheming about ways to block Congress from certifying Biden’s election, efforts that are under scrutiny as part of a House select committee investigation of the deadly Capitol attack by hundreds of Trump supporters. As they have carved out new roles in the conservative ecosystem, Flynn and Bannon still support Trump’s conspiratorial claims that he lost in 2020 due to massive cheating, a mantra that reinforces their drives to expand local and state electoral influence to give Republicans a better shot at recapturing Congress next year, and the White House in 2024. “We’re seeing a dangerous trend of election deniers lining up to fill election administration positions across the country,” Joanna Lydgate, chief executive of the States United Democracy Center, said in a statement to the Guardian. “And the efforts by Flynn, Bannon and other promoters of the big lie are all part of this playbook to hijack elections in 2022 and 2024 if their preferred candidate doesn’t win.” Likewise, as they have revved up political work on multiple fronts, the two ex-Trump advisers have taken more extremist stances sparking strong criticism. Flynn, a retired army lieutenant general, has been skewered for his authoritarian style advocacy of “one religion” for America, and for speaking at some events with heavy presences by adherents of QAnon conspiracy movement. Flynn’s call for “one religion” came during a talk to a conservative Christian audience in Texas on the ReAwaken America tour in November. “If we are going to have one nation under God, which we must, we have to have one religion,” Flynn said. “One nation under God and one religion under God, right? All of us, working together.” Flynn’s feature role at ReAwaken America meetings in several states such as Michigan and Florida is hardly an accident, according to Byrne, the multimillionaire founder of the America Project that counts Flynn as special adviser and spokesperson. Byrne, who has joined Flynn at some ReAwaken rallies, said in text messages that he and Flynn had a large hand in launching the ReAwaken tour during the spring by bankrolling the events with some “tens of thousands of dollars” from the America Project. Overall, Byrne said that the America Project has raised about $9.5m, of which he donated close to $7m. Byrne and the America Project poured over $3m into a months-long audit of Arizona’s largest county, which Trump was banking on to find major fraud, but which resulted in no significant changes to Biden’s win there or overall in the state, much to Trump’s dismay. Byrne said the project has helped promote audits in other states besides Arizona. Boasting a net worth pegged at about $75m, Byrne is the ex-chief executive of furniture retailer Overstock. Byrne texted that he didn’t vote for Trump, and deems himself a “rule of law” advocate who claims there’s still a “mountain of evidence” to support the widely debunked allegations of fraud. Byrne’s project has had no dearth of Trump links. The project’s president until late last month was Emily Newman, a former Trump aide. Newman, along with Byrne and Flynn, attended a meeting in December 2020 with Trump about ways to block Biden taking office where Flynn touted the option of declaring martial law and deploying the military to rerun the election in key states Trump lost, according to multiple reports. Flynn’s brother, Joe Flynn, has succeeded Newman as the project’s president, Byrne said. On top of his work with the America Project, Flynn’s focus on expanding the Maga base at the local level increased when he became chairman in May of another non-profit, America’s Future, which, in turn, has partnered with Turning Point USA and others to form a larger alliance dubbed County Citizens Defending Freedom USA. The county citizens group has sponsored an array of training programs, protests and candidate meetings with a focus on mask mandates, vaccine requirements and critical race theory, according to Florida lawyer Ron Filipkowski, a former prosecutor who authored a Washington Post article on the wave of local drives by Trump backers. For his part, Bannon’s heavy emphasis on a local “precinct strategy” to help Republican’s electoral fortunes combines conspiratorial and apocalyptic bravado. Bannon told CNN in December that his War Room podcast is an organizing tool to expand Trump’s base. “It’s about winning elections with the right people – Maga people,” Bannon said. “We will have our people in at every level.” “We’re taking over all the elections,” Bannon said in November on his War Room podcast. “We’re going to get to the bottom of [last year’s election] and we’re going to decertify the electors. And you’re going to have a constitutional crisis. But you know what? We’re a big and tough country, and we can handle that, we’ll be able to handle that. We’ll get through that.” Megan Squire, a computer science professor at Elon University, told the Guardian that much of Bannon’s political messaging has relied on alternative social media channels such as Telegram that appeal to conservative and far right allies to spread pro Trump gospel and help broaden the Maga base at the local level. To Squire, Bannon’s rhetoric and large audience look increasingly dangerous. “After being de-platformed from mainstream social media over the past year, Bannon has been promoting ‘alternative’, permissive social media channels such as Telegram and Gettr. There his listeners are able to amplify and intensify Bannon’s messaging into a 24-hour-a-day echo chamber filled with disinformation, scams, and conspiracy theories.” For Lydgate, the chief executive of the States United Democracy Center, the multi-front drives by Bannon, Flynn and other key Trump loyalists pose serious risks for the integrity of future elections. “They want to sow doubt in our democracy and make it easier to undermine the will of American voters.”",News/US news,Bannon and allies bid to expand pro-Trump influence in local US politics,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/steve-bannon-donald-trump-michael-flynn-politics
1/3/2022,"“The events of last week are just par for the army’s inhumanity and immorality.” So says Michael Isherwood, chair of the Burma Humanitarian Mission and program director of Backpack Medics, after Myanmar’s junta massacred more than 35 people, including two Save the Children workers, on Christmas Eve. At the time, the attack garnered international headlines, with the children’s charity calling it “absolutely horrifying”, and the UN urging an investigation.  Yet Isherwood says attacks like the one on 24 December are not isolated, and describes a military that is “randomly shooting unarmed men, women and children, who steal livestock and burn homes to the ground, who use rape as a weapon”. The medics he works with recognise the risks and “understand that the Burma army has no morals, character or anything close to civilised decency and behaviour”, he says. Myanmar has seen killings, imprisonment and chaos since the military seized power from the elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi in February last year. Resistance groups have emerged but anyone thought to be opposed to military rule risks being arrested, sentenced to hard labour, or killed. More than 1,300 people have died at the hands of security forces, according to a local monitoring group. Another humanitarian worker, who preferred to not to be named, says: “This incident in Kayah does not mark a new level of violence. It’s not a shift in the pattern of the approach of security forces. It’s not unusual in this context. This is a normal tactic.” She believes the attack was intended to “oppress through fear the civilian population” rather than specifically target aid workers. “Since they’re blatantly, egregiously and frequently targeting the civil population in that way, and since that will often happen in areas where aid activities are needed, then of course that raises the collateral risks to aid actors,” she says. Her organisation would continue its work regardless, she says. A clampdown on domestic media has made details of alleged atrocities hard to confirm, she says, but the link to an international charity in the Christmas Eve attack has offered a grim insight into the risks the people of Myanmar regularly face. According to the Karen Human Rights Group, in the Sagaing region 11 civilians were burned alive on 7 December and 40 people were killed in three different attacks in July. Inger Ashing, the chief executive of Save the Children, put out a statement saying: “The people of Myanmar continue to be targeted with increasing violence and these events demand an immediate response.” On Christmas Eve, women, children, and two Save the Children staff members – both new fathers, aged 32 and 28 – were among the victims found on a highway outside Moso village in Kayah state, eastern Myanmar, where pro-democracy rebels have been fighting the military. Save the Children says its staff were travelling back to the office after working nearby when they were caught up in the attack. According to state media, the Myanmar military said it killed a number of “terrorists with weapons” after people in seven vehicles refused to stop. Images of the scene show the blackened remains of multiple bodies inside torched trucks. One international staffer living in Myanmar, who requested anonymity for safety reasons, says: “In this case, I don’t think there was any particular sense that the road was a risky one. It happened quite suddenly. Doing it on Christmas Eve probably was not accidental.” Many in Kayah state identify as Christian. The humanitarian worker says as far as their operations are concerned, they’d be keeping in close contact with staff in Kayah state and tracking their travel. “We’re trying to do what we can to advise people on where is safe to go and where is not but you can’t really know. It’s so widespread.”",News/World news,‘A normal tactic’: Myanmar’s aid workers vow to press on despite Christmas Eve massacre,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/a-normal-tactic-myanmars-aid-workers-vow-to-press-on-despite-christmas-eve-massacre
