5/17/2022,"The evacuation of wounded Ukrainian troops from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol is under way, Volodomyr Zelenskiy confirmed, with more than 260 fighters transported out of the plant. The troops have fulfilled their combat mission, the general staff of the armed forces said. Ukraine’s deputy defense minister has said an “exchange procedure will take place” to bring evacuees home. Ukraine’s Joint Forces Task Force said on Monday that 20 civilians, including a child, were killed in Russian shelling in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Western military sources say that Vladimir Putin is involved in the war in Ukraine “at the level of a colonel or brigadier”. The Russian leader is reportedly so personally involved he is helping determine the movement of forces in the Donbas. Ukrainian officials claimed that Ukrainian troops in the country’s north-east had pushed back Russian forces from the city of Kharkiv and advanced as far as the border with Russia. Ukrainian forces in the east of the country could be slowed by Russia’s ally Belarus, which is mobilising special forces along Ukraine’s northern border, British intelligence has warned. Russian forces have shelled frontline positions in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas area as fighting becomes increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war. After Sweden and Finland yesterday confirmed plans to join Nato, Sweden is seeking to quell Turkish opposition by sending diplomats to the country. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said Turkey will not approve the bids, and that delegations from the countries should not bother coming. Vladimir Putin said Russia had no issue with Finland and Sweden, but that the expansion of military infrastructure on their territory would demand a reaction from Moscow, as the Nordic countries move closer to joining Nato, which Russia has branded a mistake with far-reaching consequences. Hungary has been accused of “holding the EU hostage” over its refusal to agree an oil embargo against Russia, as the bloc struggles to reach consensus on its latest sanctions aimed at eroding the Kremlin’s ability to wage war. American fast-food giant McDonald’s will exit the Russian market and sell its business in the increasingly isolated country, the company said on Monday. Other multinationals to have pulled out of Russia since February include H&M, Starbucks and Ikea. Meanwhile, the Moscow city government is to take over a factory belonging to the French carmaker Renault and use it to revive the Soviet-era Moskvitch in Russia’s first major nationalisation of a foreign company during its war in Ukraine.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 83 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-83-of-the-invasion
5/17/2022,"A mobile phone app has been launched that will help social media users to detect fake profiles and speed up their removal. The Think Before You Link app will help people to spot characteristics of fraudulent profiles used by spies and other malicious actors, according to the Cabinet Office and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure. Last year MI5 warned that at least 10,000 people in the UK had been approached by spies posing behind fake profiles on LinkedIn with the intention of obtaining and sharing secret information in the last five years. The government has said that more than 10,000 people in the UK had been targeted on LinkedIn and Facebook in the last year. The director general of MI5, Ken McCallum, said malicious profiles were being used on an “industrial scale”. Current and former civil servants are often attractive targets because of their experience, and can be sent fake offers of consultancy work if they connect with unknown users. Research by the University of Portsmouth has indicated that the threat of “economic espionage” is often forgotten by users, who are more aware of the chances of trolling and fraud – but 75% of people say they have received requests from profiles they find suspicious. The app has been developed in cooperation with behavioural scientists, and includes features such as a profile reviewer, which will help users identify fake profiles and report anything suspicious. McCallum said: “MI5 has seen over 10,000 disguised approaches on professional networking sites from foreign spies to people up and down the UK. Foreign spies are actively working to build relationships with those working in government, in high-tech business and in academia.” Steve Barclay, the lead government minister for cyber security, said: “The online threat via social media is increasing, with fake profiles on sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook being created on an industrial scale. “Many of these profiles are established as an elaborate ruse for eliciting details from either officials or members of the public who may have access to information relating to our national security. “It is therefore crucial that we do all we can to protect ourselves and our information, ensuring those who we connect with online are who they say they are. This new app will be an important tool in that endeavour.”",News/Technology,‘Think Before You Link’: app launched to help social media users detect fake profiles,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/17/think-before-you-link-app-launched-to-help-social-media-users-detect-fake-profiles
5/17/2022,"Hard-up families are skipping meals, wearing coats indoors to stay warm, and living in the dark because they can’t afford to switch on the lights, according to a leading children’s charity. Action for Children said in one case a boy it worked with had been off school with sore feet caused by chilblains. The boy told charity workers that the house was cold all the time because the heating was not on, and he and his siblings were wearing coats inside and sharing beds at night to keep warm. In another case, a parent told charity workers she would take her toddler to bed with their tea when they got back from nursery “just to keep warm”. Other clients described being unable to afford school uniforms, struggling to afford food, and trying to heat a room with a single gas hob. Current levels of severe and persistent hardship among families supported by the charity’s children’s centres, triggered by cuts to universal credit and rising energy bills, were among the worst it could remember, said Action for Children’s director of policy, Imran Hussain. “The worst pain and misery of the cost of living crisis is being felt by children in low-income families, yet the government is refusing to target help for these children or accept that it needs to rethink its huge cut to universal credit,” he said. Ministers have refused to commit to extra direct help for families despite an average annual £700 rise in household fuel costs since April, and rising food insecurity. Families face the fastest fall in living standards this year since the 1950s, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. A children’s hardship fund set up by the charity two years ago to provide one-off help to struggling families during the pandemic has evolved into a “permanent crisis fund” helping thousands of families, it said. Since October it has helped almost 2,500 families with grants of about £250 each, half of which were spent on food. Leanne, a mother of two and finance officer from the West Country, said she had needed food vouchers from the Action for Children crisis fund because she could not keep up with rising food and energy costs. “It was a struggle anyway, but things are now so much worse … A lot of people think that food banks are just for people who don’t work, but people who work like me need them now,” she said. Analysis of the crisis fund showed that half of families accessing it for help reported stress, anxiety or mental health concerns among the adults or children. One in five applications highlighted the £20 cut in universal credit last October as a trigger for the families’ difficulties. Iceland Foods Charitable Foundation, which has donated £300,000 to the fund since November, said that while it was “thrilled” to help there were limits to its philanthropic work. It said government “especially” had a key role to play in offering a lifeline to families in crisis. Paul Dhaliwal, the trading director of Iceland Foods and a trustee of the foundation, said: “We know that lots of our customers are facing real hardship. Many were badly impacted by the pandemic, and the soaring cost of living has only added to their difficulties.” A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures on the cost of living and we are doing what we can to help, including spending £22bn across the next financial year to support people with energy bills and cut fuel duty. “For the hardest hit, we’re putting an average of £1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families on universal credit, have also boosted the minimum wage by more than £1,000 a year for full-time workers and our household support fund is there to help with the cost of everyday essentials.”",News/Society,"Poor families skipping meals and unable to afford heating, charity says ",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/17/poverty-families-cost-of-living-crisis-action-for-children
5/17/2022,"Women with invasive breast cancer could be injected with a magnetic marker liquid to tell doctors if their disease has spread, according to a recommendation by the government’s health advisers. The substance, called Magtrace, has been shown to locate the presence of sentinel lymph nodes, which show if the cancer has progressed beyond the breast. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which advises ministers and the NHS on which treatments represent value for money in England and Wales, has issued draft guidance endorsing the use of Magtrace in conjunction with a probe called Sentimag. Magtrace is a non-radioactive brown liquid that acts as a magnetic marker and visual dye. It is injected into the tissue around a cancerous tumour in the breast. Particles are absorbed into the lymphatic system, follow the route that cancer cells are most likely to take when they spread from the original site of the disease and become trapped in sentinel lymph nodes. Once inside the patient, its progress is tracked using the Sentimag probe. It emits sounds of different pitches as it moves over the skin when it passes over the Magtrace, similar to the way a metal detector locates metal objects in the ground.

Once the sentinel lymph node has been located, surgeons remove it and undertake a biopsy during which a pathologist checks if any signs of cancer are present. If so, they may carry out further surgery to remove more lymph nodes. Nice has recommended the procedure as an alternative to the existing way of identifying breast cancer that has spread, which involves the injection of radioactive isotopes and a blue dye. “People with breast cancer want to know if their cancer has been isolated or has spread to the rest of their body. The earlier this is established, the better the potential outcomes will be,” said Jeanette Kusel, Nice’s acting director for medical technology and digital. The agency said adoption of the system would help the NHS reduce its reliance on radioactive isotopes, which are imported, and enable any hospital to offer it, not just those with nuclear medicine facilities to use isotopes, which may make care more convenient for patients. The health and social care secretary welcomed Nice’s decision.“This promising research could provide a new tool for our scientists to track and slow the spread of breast cancer, the most common cancer in the UK,” Sajid Javid said.“We are always on the lookout for innovative treatments to speed up diagnosis and improve survival rates and we will outline more in our 10-year cancer plan, due this summer”.” But Nice warned Magtrace could produce side-effects and adverse events. These include the staining of a patient’s skin and their ability to have an MRI scan in future, and “so use of Magtrace should be considered carefully for people who are likely to need follow-up MRI studies”.",News/Society,Magnetic marker liquid could be used to show if breast cancer has spread ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/17/magnetic-marker-liquid-breast-cancer-spread-nice-magtrace
5/17/2022,"A seething Granit Xhaka laid into his Arsenal teammates after their disastrous defeat at Newcastle and said they did not “have the balls to play” as their Champions League hopes all but disappeared. Arsenal must beat Everton on Sunday and hope Tottenham lose at relegated Norwich if they are to make the top four; they were soundly beaten at St James’ Park by a Ben White own goal and a late clincher from Bruno Guimarães, and Xhaka’s extraordinary intervention was almost certainly born of frustration at letting a golden opportunity slip. “From the first minute to the 90th we didn’t deserve to be on the pitch today,” Xhaka said. “What happened was a disaster performance and like this you don’t deserve to play Champions League, you don’t even deserve to play Europa League. It’s very hard to take at the moment. I don’t know why we’re not doing what the coaches ask for. “If someone isn’t ready for this game, stay at home. It doesn’t matter the age. If you’re not ready or you’re nervous, stay on the bench, stay at home, don’t come here. We need people to have the balls to come here and play. We knew this game was maybe the most important for us but, with a performance like this, it’s not acceptable.” Arteta’s outlook was no sunnier and the manager admitted his side had never got started. “Normally I sit here and I can defend [the team],” he said. “Today Newcastle were 100 times better than us in every department from beginning to end and it is very hard to accept it. We didn’t cope, we didn’t compete. We never got into the game. We put ourselves in trouble, we lost every duel. Newcastle deserved to win the game, probably by a bigger margin.” He stopped short of saying he felt let down by his side, which has been stretched to the bare bones by injury. “No, I am the maximum responsible,” he said. “If someone has created an expectation this year, it is those players and I will always defend them. But [tonight] that is a really difficult thing to do.” Eddie Howe could bask in a performance he called “our best by some distance since I was at the club” and a first win over top-six opposition for Newcastle this season. “It’s a step forward, definitely,” he said. “I think you saw a progression and evolution to how we played.”",Sport/Football,Granit Xhaka claims some Arsenal teammates lack ‘balls to play’ after loss,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/granit-xhaka-rages-at-arsenal-teammates-for-disaster-performance
