2/7/2022,"Ethan Lynne, a 17-year-old student from Virginia, is calling out Governor Glenn Youngkin, after he became the target of online harassment from Youngkin’s campaign on Twitter. On Saturday, Lynne tweeted that “The historian tasked with teaching about slavery at the Virginia Governors Mansion just resigned after finding the Youngkins converted her classroom into a family room – and emptied her office,” calling the action “shameful.” In a now-deleted tweet, Youngkin’s official campaign account responded by posting a photo of Lynne with former Virginia governor Ralph Northam, saying “Here’s a picture of Ethan with a man that had a Blackface/KKK photo in his yearbook.” On Sunday, Lynne responded with a statement on Twitter, saying he has gotten “no communication from the Governor’s office” since the tweet was posted and taken down, and condemning it entirely. “In school, we are taught how to spot bullying, and their tweet last night, perfectly fit that description,” Lynne wrote. “It is disgusting, disturbing, and unbecoming of the Commonwealth to see the Governor and his office stoop this low, especially on a public platform.” Lynne continued: “We all know that Youngkin has an agenda to attack and endanger students, and last night proved that. I will not be intimidated by these attacks will continue to be a voice for students across the Commonwealth.” Though that tweet was deleted, Youngkin’s Press Secretary Macaulay Porter responded to Lynne’s post from his own account, saying “Nothing was moved by the Youngkin administration staff and the space has not been transformed into a living room. The previous mansion director oversaw the moving of Deetz’s desk. The First Lady looks forward to finalizing the executive mansion layout and tours.” Reps for Youngkin did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.",U.S./The Wrap,"17-Year-Old Responds to ‘Disgusting, Disturbing’ Online Attack by Virginia Gov.

2/7/2022,"A thrift shop owner and her husband bidding on storage units in Savannah in October 2021 were in for a surprise when they went through their latest find and discovered that someone had left cremated human remains inside. “It was one of the first things my son found,” Megan Leigh, the owner of My Angel’s Attic thrift shop in Jasper County, said. “My husband wanted to take them to the dump and I was like, ‘no, we cannot do that.’” With only a name, birthday and death date that were printed on one side of the pink marble urn, Leigh took to Facebook to try and track down the family, she said. She made posts in Savannah and Jasper County community pages on social media, but no one seemed to know who the woman was. After messaging multiple people with the same last name printed on the urn, or anyone she thought might have a connection to the 79-year-old woman, she found a grandson who lives in Oklahoma. “He wanted her,” Leigh said. “They were originally going to cover the shipping cost, then he went MIA on me.” Despite several messages, she never got an answer, she said. The woman, who passed away in 2019, is also from Oklahoma and, Leigh found out, her son was still in the Savannah area. She was able to get in contact with his wife, who told her they would drive to Jasper County to pick up the cremains. Again, Leigh said, the family disappeared. “I would never have expected to find someone’s ashes,” Leigh said. “It broke my heart.” Leigh’s own mother passed away two years ago and, she said, if she had lost her ashes she would have been “devastated.” When she first brought the woman’s ashes home, she didn’t know what to do with them. She considered placing them in her home beside her mother’s ashes and photo, but her family wasn’t too keen on the idea. The cremains now sit in the back of Leigh’s van. She sees them every day and tries to fill in the gaps of who the woman was. “I can’t hold onto her forever,” Leigh said. “She’s not my mom, she’s not my family.” Jasper County Coroner Willie P. Aiken III said that unclaimed cremains are, unfortunately, not an uncommon occurrence. His office even has cases of unclaimed cremains spanning decades, he said. He offered to take the cremains from Leigh and have his office contact the dead woman’s family, and, if there’s no response, place the cremains alongside the others in a mass burial. Members of the woman’s family did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In the meantime, the ashes remain in Leigh’s van and she’s working on a solution: either getting the ashes back to the family or, when her “heart gives up,” trying to find a final resting place for them. “My heart is soft,” Leigh said. “I have to just try.”",U.S./Hilton Head Island Packet,SC woman bought storage unit for thrift shop.

2/7/2022,"A “body” found along a trail in Georgia turned out to be just a “case of littering.” Deputies responded Thursday, Feb. 3, to a report of what was believed to be a body in Hitchiti National Forest, according to a Facebook post from the Jones County Sheriff’s Office. They arrived to find “what appeared to be the body of a deceased female wearing white socks.” Investigators were called to the scene but soon discovered the “body” was a life-sized doll — “complete with accessories” and a model number. “Never missing the opportunity, the crime scene was appropriately processed and the evidence was collected and brought to the Sheriff’s Office,” the Facebook post read. Deputies named the “victim” Selena. They said she is “a little under the weather” but expected to fully recover. “In all seriousness, thank God for small blessings in that this just turned out to be a case of littering,” the sheriff’s office said. “If you know Selena or are responsible for her whereabouts, rest assured no DNA was collected and you are safe.” The sheriff’s office just asks that, in the future, people dispose of their items more responsibly.

2/7/2022,"YANQING, China — The slopes snake through jagged cliffs on the outskirts of a desert. Massive rock faces loom on either side. Snow rarely falls, but wind often whirls, and neither tourists nor residents ever ski here. But Olympians now do, because when China won the right to host these Winter Games, it embarked on a three-year project to build the National Alpine Ski Center “from scratch.” It was once uninhabited “steep mountain ridges,” as Li Changzhou, a deputy general manager with Beijing Enterprises Group, the property owner and constructor, said. Everything around it still is. Shrubby trees and barren hillside line the road that winds up Xiaohaituo Mountain. Everything outside the venue is some shade of brown. But then there are thin ribbons of white, visible from airplanes and miles away, striking proof that the Olympics have ventured outside their natural habitat. Beijing built them because it had no other choice. It bid for the 2022 Games without an Olympic-standard Alpine resort. So, shortly after winning an International Olympic Committee vote in 2015, it began blasting out massive chunks of its tallest mountain, near the Great Wall in this suburban district, Yanqing. It contracted dozens of foreign experts to turn rugged terrain into European-style slopes. Alpine legend Bernhard Russi designed them. American cowboy Tom Johnston manicured them. But first, this water-scarce region had to provide him with snow. So, local authorities began reaching far and wide for the natural resources to create it. Most international Alpine skiing competition requires snow-making these days. Beijing’s Olympic operation, though, is especially intensive. China, working with premier artificial snow supplier TechnoAlpin, built miles-long networks of pipeline to connect reservoirs outside Yanqing to another reservoir at Xiaohaituo Mountain. That smaller reservoir stores the water being used to coat the Olympic slopes. Pumps and hundreds of snow guns then turn it into the white surface you’ll see on TV. The skiers who’ll use it actually like it. The artificial snow, as U.S. star Mikaela Shiffrin said Friday, is “grippy” and “aggressive.” The setting, though, looks and feels odd. The IOC had warned that it would. A bid evaluation report explained long ago that “there could be no snow outside of the racecourse, especially in Yanqing, impacting the visual perception of the snow setting.” Organizers seemingly sought to address these concerns. Trees were planted in rigid, uniform rows, in an attempt to lend a foresty feel to the scenery. The snow guns have tried to dress some of them in white. The Beijing Organizing Committee once released renderings that depicted the Olympic venue as a recreation of the European Alps. The reality is much different. Small patches of leftover snow — perhaps fake, perhaps real — line some sections of mountainside. The rest of it looks dry and dead. On the other side of these mountains is the Gobi, the sixth-large desert in the world, and the reason none of this is surprising. The climate is cold enough. But it is arid. Vegetation is parched. Forecasts suggest some snow could arrive next weekend. But nowhere near enough to change the visuals. The most prominent element, instead, will continue to be wind. High-speed gusts postponed Sunday’s men’s downhill, one day after also cancelling a training session. “I think it is always gonna be windy,” U.S. skier Bryce Bennett said here Sunday. “It's just how this place is.”",World/Yahoo Sports,How Beijing built Olympic ski slopes ‘from scratch’ on the outskirts of a desert,https://news.yahoo.com/how-beijing-built-olympic-ski-slopes-from-scratch-on-the-outskirts-of-a-desert-094831125.html

Why it matters: The incident gives new vividness to how impulsively McCain made a fateful decision that badly diminished him in his race against then-Sen. Barack Obama. Here's how Peters tells the story in his book (out Tuesday from Crown), which traces the Trumpification of the Grand Old Party over a three-decade arc, stretching back to Pat Buchanan in 1992: ""Mark Salter, a longtime aide to McCain, cautioned him that voters could see a Palin pick as discordant with the message of readiness and experience that the campaign had been focusing on as a contrast with Obama, a forty-seven-year-old first-term senator. 'There’s worse things, John, than losing an election. You could lose your reputation,' Salter told him."" Steve Schmidt, a top campaign strategist often blamed for pushing Palin, ""also thought Palin was a risk but said maybe it was one worth taking,"" Peters writes: [Schmidt] told McCain he should consider whether it would be worth it if he chose Palin and lost, but also knew in the end that he’d lost because he did something bold. ""What you’ve got to decide,"" Schmidt told the senator, ""is would you rather lose by seven going for it?"" McCain turned to his wife, Cindy. ""John, it's a gamble,"" she said. This made McCain's face light up. ""Well, I wish you hadn’t said that,"" he said. McCain, an avid craps player, balled up his fist and blew on it, then shook it like he was about to roll a pair of dice. ""F--- it,"" he said. ""Let's do it."" Between the lines: Schmidt thought that to have a chance at winning, McCain needed to be ahead coming out of the September convention. Schmidt couldn't see that happening with either of the other finalists — Mitt Romney or Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty.

2/7/2022,"By Sarah N. Lynch WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump received bad advice from ""snake oil salesmen"" who falsely told him Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, Pence's former chief of staff Marc Short said. ""Unfortunately, the president had many bad advisers who were basically snake oil salesman giving him really random and novel ideas as to what the vice president could do,"" Short said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. Short's comments came two days after Pence rebuked Trump in a speech to the conservative Federalist Society, saying Trump was wrong to suggest the vice president has the power to overturn an election. ""I believe that Joe Biden is the duly elected President of the United States,"" Short said on Sunday. ""The reality is that there was not enough significant fraud that was presented that would have overturned any of those states' elections."" Short, who was with Pence on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to overturn the election results, recently appeared before the House Select Committee investigating the siege to answer questions. During the attack, some of the rioters shouted ""Hang Mike Pence!"" and one now-convicted https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-seeks-four-years-prison-capitol-rioter-qanon-shaman-2021-11-17 Trump supporter known as the ""QAnon Shaman"" left the vice president a note that read: ""It's only a matter of time, justice is coming."" Last week, the National Archives announced it would be turning over Pence's records to the panel, after Trump lost a legal bid to block the committee from seeing them. Short did not discuss the details of his testimony on Sunday, saying only that he was complying with a subpoena. However, he cast doubt on whether Pence would ever appear before the committee to testify, telling NBC ""that would be a pretty unprecedented step."" ""I think it is very different to subpoena a former vice president to talk about private conversations he had with the president,"" Short said. ""It's never happened before."" The committee is investigating whether any of Trump's inner circle helped plan the attack on the Capitol. It is also scrutinizing what steps Trump took to keep himself in power. Last week, new details emerged in media reports suggesting Trump was actively exploring whether the U.S. government had the power to seize voting machines. Reuters has confirmed that in one meeting with former Attorney General William Barr in late November 2020, Trump broached the topic, telling Barr his legal team told him the Justice Department was sitting on its hands when it could be seizing voting machines, according to one person familiar with the matter. Barr immediately shut the idea down, saying the department had no such power, the person added. Short, speaking on NBC on Sunday, said he had not personally heard that Trump was interested in seizing voting machines. (Reporting by Sarah N.

2/7/2022,"Pence refused calls to leave the Capitol during the January 6, 2021, riot because it would create bad optics, his former chief of staff said. Marc Short said Secret Service asked to remove Pence several times but the former VP said he didn't want to be seen ""fleeing."" ""That's not a visual I want the world to see,"" Pence said, according to Short. Marc Short, former chief of staff to former Vice President Mike Pence, said that Pence resisted calls from his security team to leave the Capitol during the January 6, 2021, riot because he didn't want to project an image of ""fleeing"" the building. Speaking on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, Short said that Pence refused to leave his office after being evacuated from the Senate floor since he was in the middle of counting Electoral College votes, despite multiple attempts from Secret Service to exit the premises as the situation at the Capitol became more dire. ""At that point, Secret Service had tried to move him twice, but the vice president was resolute and said: 'I'm not going to let the free world see us fleeing the Capitol, and I'm staying,'"" Short said, recalling visiting Pence's his office shortly after the evacuation. Pence eventually agreed to move from the suite when Secret Service officials once again pleaded with him, telling the vice president that they couldn't protect him in their current location because of a glass door, Short told host Chuck Todd. ""They evacuated us to a secure location at the bottom of the Capitol,"" he said. ""At one point there was an attempt to again put the vice president into a motorcade, but he was clear to say 'that's not a visual I want the world to see of us fleeing the Capitol.'"" —Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) February 6, 2022 Several rioters who stormed the building while lawmakers were meeting to certify the results of the 2020 election chanted ""Hang Mike Pence,"" though Short said on Sunday that he didn't personally hear the now-infamous line during the insurrection, adding that he wasn't sure if Pence had heard it either. The rioters — ardent supporters of former President Donald Trump and his claims of a stolen election — stormed the Capitol building after they listened to a raucous speech from Trump. At the event, the then-president continued to push the debunked theory that he — and not now-President Joe Biden — was the rightful victor in the election. Biden easily won the Electoral College 306-232 while also capturing the popular vote by a 51%-47% margin, garnering over 7 million more votes than Trump (81 million to 74 million). So far, more than 760 people have been charged for their actions relating to the riot, according to Insider's database. Until this month, Pence, like other major figures in the GOP, had appeared to downplay the events of January 6. ""I'm not going to allow the Democrats or the national media to use one tragic day in January to demean the intentions of 74 million people who stood with us in our cause,"" Pence said late last year. He continued: ""And I'm not going to allow the Democrats to use one tragic day in January to distract attention from their failed agenda and the failed policies of the Biden administration. We're going to focus on the future."" But Pence made headlines last Friday for a rare break with Trump, saying that the former president was ""wrong"" to say that the vice president could've overturned the results of the 2020 election. ""The presidency belongs to the American people, and the American people alone,"" Pence said during his remarks delivered to the Federalist Society, an organization that advocates for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. ""And frankly, there is no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president."" While neither Pence nor Trump have officially declared that they will pursue White House bids in 2024, the former president has teased a run since last year and the former vice president has continued to speak at conservative events across the country since leaving office.
