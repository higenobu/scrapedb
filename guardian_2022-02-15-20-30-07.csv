2/15/2022,"Hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19 in the US are now driven heavily (although not exclusively) by the small share who remain unvaccinated. According to the latest CDC estimates, an unvaccinated American is 14 times more likely to die of Covid-related complications as compared with someone who has two doses of the vaccine – and they are 68 times more likely to die from Covid-related health problems than someone who is “boosted.” Explanations for persistent vaccine hesitancy abound. An increasingly dominant narrative, especially among progressives, is that failure to comply with the directives of public health officials is absurd and must be driven by some pathology or deficit. Among those who subscribe to this worldview, debates turn around identifying the primary malfunction of “those people”: Are they ignorant? Brainwashed? Stupid? Selfish and apathetic? All of the above? Left off the menu is the possibility that hesitancy and non-compliance may actually be reasonable responses to how experts and other elites have conducted themselves, both before and during the pandemic.  Yet there are many powerful and fairly straightforward reasons for people to be suspicious of authorities, both with respect to the Covid-19 vaccine and other pandemic-related public health guidance. In no particular order: The Covid-19 vaccines were developed, approved, mass produced and distributed at record speed. On the one hand, this was a miracle of modern science, state capacity and private sector ingenuity. On the other hand, the rapid process gave rise to questions about whether proper protocols had been followed and exacerbated concerns about how safe and effective the vaccines would be. These rapidly produced vaccines also pioneered the use of “artificial proteins never seen in the natural world”. Again, a miracle of modern science, but one that left many wondering if there was sufficient research on possible long-term problems and side-effects, given that the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine was the first mRNA vaccine ever to achieve full FDA approval in the US and was a developed and approved on a radically accelerated timetable. During the 2020 US presidential campaign, both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris expressed grave concerns about the “Trump vaccines,” alleging that they may not have been properly developed, vetted, approved or manufactured – and consequently, may not be safe. The Biden administration is now depicting hesitancy around these same vaccines as irrational and immoral. In a recent interview, Dr Fauci outright acknowledged that he has engaged in “noble lies” with respect to herd immunity vaccination targets in order to encourage more people to take the shots. Pre-Omicron, the vaccines were portrayed as providing more than 90% effectiveness against Covid-19 infection. It turned out that even a two-dose sequence faced precipitous declines in efficacy, dropping to less than 50% effectiveness several months after the second shot. That is, a two-shot regime ended up at the low end of what would be considered “effective” at preventing infection at all, which is why we ended up with boosters. In the wake of Omicron, even people who have been “boosted” with a third shot are regularly experiencing breakthrough infections. And so, over time, the justification for getting vaccinated has shifted. Rather than being sold as a means of preventing infection altogether, it is now argued that people should take the shots in order to reduce hospitalizations and deaths (the vaccines remain very effective at this). That is, the main benefit of vaccination has been revised down dramatically – from outright preventing infections to reducing severe infections – even as people are encouraged to get more and more shots in order to achieve that benefit. It was initially reported that a single shot provided great protection, although a booster could conceivably be suggested down the line. Then two shots became the standard to be “fully vaccinated.” Now, according to Dr Fauci, three shots will soon become a requirement for being considered “fully vaccinated” – and the CDC is urging some Americans to pursue a fourth shot. There does not seem to be a clear end in sight for how many shots may ultimately be suggested. The CDC set a tight three to four-week dosing schedule between the first and second vaccine doses. Robust evidence has since emerged that waiting eight to 12 weeks between doses provides much better antibody response, reducing the prospect of breakthrough infections while simultaneously extending the window of high infection resistance. That is, many breakthrough infections people are experiencing conceivably could have been avoided – and perhaps many unpleasant vaccine side effects as well – had the government been less aggressive in pumping as many shots, as fast as possible, into as many arms as possible. Nonetheless, CDC guidance remains unchanged to thaQis day. Each additional round of shots generates billions for vaccine manufacturers. That is, pharmaceutical companies have a clear stake in multiple rounds being mandated or encouraged for as many people as possible, in as many places as possible (at as high a price as possible). They have a clear interest in funding and promoting research suggesting that more rounds of vaccination are needed – and they have been doing just that, while lobbying governments to adopt their vaccines over those of their competitors. The CDC receives immense sums of money from big pharma, while failing to adequately disclose these donations and industry ties, despite obvious conflicts of interest in many of these “gifts.” This was a big problem even before the pandemic. Yet despite vocal calls for reform, no changes were made – even as donations rapidly increased in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis. Through its affiliated foundation, more than $100m was pumped into the CDC by corporations in the fiscal year 2020 alone (not to mention additional donations by anonymous donors and named individuals, foundations or lobbying groups associated with the pharmaceutical industry). The FDA approved the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as safe and effective. It subsequently advised against Americans taking this vaccine due to rare but occasionally fatal side effects. According to the VAERS database, nearly 12,000 Americans have died shortly after receiving Covid-19 vaccines, possibly as a result of side-effects or allergic reactions from the vaccines. On the one hand, these casualties represent a miniscule share (0.0022%) of all doses given out, and are radically offset by the immense number of lives saved by vaccination. But at the same time, 12,000 lives are not nothing. There are many, many towns in the US with populations smaller than that. Nonetheless, people expressing concerns about vaccine-related deaths are often mocked or derided. Those who are harmed by vaccines (and their families) are generally not eligible to seek financial recompense. Alex Azar, the Department of Health and Human Services director under Trump, evoked federal powers to completely shield pharmaceutical companies from being sued should their vaccines produce adverse reactions. A former pharma executive, Azar retains deep ties with the industry and stood to profit financially from many policies he enacted as a “public servant” that advanced the interests of pharmaceutical companies. Over the course of the pandemic, legislators and other government officials have invested heavily in the stock of vaccine manufacturers, and reaped significant financial windfalls from these investments. Pharma companies have reciprocally poured millions into the campaign coffers of sympathetic congress members. They’ve spent even more money on lobbying in order to expand government purchases of their products and resist efforts to render their drugs more accessible or affordable. And their efforts have been paying off: despite Biden rhetorically endorsing a Covid-19 vaccine patent waiver, the administration has not followed through with any concrete action on this front. Following aggressive lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry, Democrats largely abandoned proposed legislation that would have allowed the federal government to negotiate down the price of drugs. All said, lawmakers, government officials and agencies, and pharmaceutical companies have all made vast amounts of cash by cooperating with one another over the course of the pandemic. Any of these factors could reasonably contribute to mistrust and non-compliance. And critically, these have just been issues related specifically to vaccines. There have been many similar tensions with respect to authorities’ approach to Covid-19 more broadly. For instance: In the early days of the pandemic, the CDC insisted that Americans didn’t need to mask, and went so far as to suggest that masking could actually be harmful under certain circumstances. They later insisted that everyone should mask in public settings, even if they are fully vaccinated. Mask mandates have proliferated. Cloth masks, once deemed effective, are now proclaimed as better than nothing, but not very helpful. Expert modeling and predictions around the Covid-19 pandemic have often been inaccurate. In particular, they tend to wildly overestimate rates of infection, the numbers of deaths, etc, over a given period. There are good reasons for the models to be skewed in this direction. Nonetheless, aggressive policies justified on the basis of these dire projections have been quite costly for many – from “lost years” of learning in schools to devastating financial losses for individuals and businesses and increased social isolation, mental health strain and substance abuse to radical increases in antisocial behaviors resulting from a breakdown of social cohesion. These costs have all been borne most heavily by those who were already relatively disadvantaged and vulnerable – populations already inclined to be skeptical of authorities. Nonetheless, those who express concern about the profound costs of Covid-19 mitigation policies are often derided as myopic and selfish. Statistics on “Covid-19 related hospitalizations” seem to significantly inflate the number of people who are seeking medical care specifically due to health problems related to a Covid-19 infection (even as Covid-19 related deaths may be significantly undercounted). While Trump was in office, insinuations that Covid-19 may have originated from a lab leak were widely derided as a racist conspiracy theory and media content exploring the possibility of a lab leak was actively censored by Facebook. Nonetheless, significant evidence has continued to build in support of the “lab leak hypothesis,” to the point where senior Biden administration officials now view the lab leak theory as roughly as credible as the natural origins theory – raising questions for many about why some public officials so aggressively (and prematurely) sought to suppress and discredit this hypothesis. Trump continues to be mocked and condemned for allegedly downplaying the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, many in the expert class and mainstream left-aligned media outlets did exactly the same thing, and have apparently memory-holed this fact. Article after article insisted that Covid-19 was little worse than the flu (and people arguing otherwise were engaging in hyperbole and speaking well beyond “the data”). Liberals widely lambasted the Trump administration travel restrictions to and from China as both unnecessary and straightforwardly racist. Upon taking office, Joe Biden would end up reimposing some of the same travel restrictions Democrats had previously condemned (on China and certain countries in Europe and Africa) – with the media largely embracing these moves by Democrats as prudent and necessary. Biden has likewise reinstated Trump’s “remain in Mexico” policy to prevent asylum seekers from entering the US, and has revived Trump’s rapid-deportation policy with respect to undocumented migrants in the US – citing Covid-19 transmission concerns to justify both policies, just like his predecessor, despite having previously condemned these same policies as immoral and unnecessary when it was Trump imposing them. With respect to all of these matters – possible adverse side effects, the origins of the virus, pandemic modeling, the efficacy of vaccines, masking, lockdowns, travel restrictions – experts and policymakers have been relying on data that was extremely provisional. They were regularly forced to improvise on the basis of their best judgments and theories. Robust efficacy for many recommended interventions and policies had not been empirically established. And frankly, they got a lot wrong. This is not unusual – it is how science works. The problem, however, is that spokespeople (and “Trust the Science” stans) regularly concealed uncertainties, suppressed inconvenient information and squashed internal dissent in an ill-conceived effort to seem maximally authoritative. Rather than enhancing confidence among skeptics, these moves often made authorities seem incompetent or dishonest when they were forced to change their positions. Because the bases for possible reconsideration had been largely concealed from public view or debate, new positions often seemed to “come out of nowhere,” or to be products of material or political considerations rather than public health concerns. At times there were blatant political double standards with respect to public health guidance. For instance, religious gatherings or right-aligned protests were widely lambasted as irresponsible public health risks, even as left-aligned protests were widely praised by public health officials – deemed not only low-risk, but also necessary. Indeed, many experts chose to very conspicuously take part in these protests, even as they sought to present themselves as neutral arbiters of “the facts.” A constellation of scholars, bureaucrats and pundits seem invested in Covid-19 remaining a “crisis” indefinitely. As political scientist Oren Cass put it, many have been granted more money, prestige and institutional power than they have ever had in the wake of the pandemic. For them, a “return to normal” would mean a return to being largely ignored and exerting marginal influence over society. It would mean losing new revenue streams they have grown accustomed to, and so on. In light of this reality, it is perfectly natural that many experts, administrators and “talking heads” would be disinclined to return to “normal” – loss aversion is a powerful cognitive bias. However, recognizing these impulses as banal (rather than nefarious) does not render them unproblematic. They can skew policymaking and expert advice towards continued invasive policies and a continued sense of panic in ways that are excessive and pernicious. Again, any of these factors could easily and quite reasonably generate skepticism about authorities and their advice, including as it relates to the Covid-19 vaccine. In a world where the experts are regularly wrong but continue to project high levels of confidence even as they change their minds and update their policies, where elite narratives about the crisis often seem to be inappropriately colored by political and financial considerations, where those who share one’s own background, values and interests do not seem to have a seat at the table in making the rules – and especially among populations that have a long history of neglect and mistreatment by the elite class (leading to high levels of pre-existing and well-founded mistrust even before the pandemic) – it would actually be bizarre to unquestioningly believe and unwaveringly conform to elite guidance. This would not be a sign of cognitive health. Put another way, there is no need to appeal to Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, Donald Trump or internet “fake news” to explain why so many have been skeptical of, or resistant to, recommendation by state officials, experts, journalists, et al. As sociologist Gil Eyal aptly put it, mistrust of authorities is actually not much of a puzzle. Compelling reasons not to trust elites or conform to their guidance are almost innumerable (I barely scratched the surface in the examples above). Perhaps the real mystery, Eyal argues, is trust rather than mistrust, voluntary compliance not rebellion, effective persuasion not persistent doubt. Overall, the CDC estimates that roughly three quarters of US adults are fully vaccinated, and 87% have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Outright vaccine refusal, in other words, is relatively rare among Americans (although many seem to have taken one dose of the vaccine and decided not to pursue second doses or boosters). And whether we’re talking about people who have (so far) declined the vaccine altogether or those who declined to pursue second shots or boosters, most who are vaccine hesitant are not resolutely anti-vaccine. Nor do they subscribe to the eccentric theories that get tossed around on the internet and hyped up in the media. Hardcore conspiratorial “anti-vaxxers” occupy a lot of the public discourse and public imagination with respect to vaccine refusal, but they are not representative of most vaccine-hesitant Americans. Rather than being a “lost cause,” the reality is that hesitant people across the country are stepping forward to be vaccinated in ever-larger numbers. Likewise, most of the Covid-19 related “resistance” movements have not been oriented around opposition to vaccines per se, but rather to vaccine mandates and passports and to Covid-19 related lockdowns, closures and masking requirements. That is, they are typically opposed to coercive (and often quite costly, dubiously effective and legally questionable) state policies intended to contain the pandemic. Irrespective of whether one agrees or disagrees with these campaigns, it is misleading and unhelpful to conflate these dissenters with “anti-vaxxers,” as many have done. All said, despite all the significant problems described above, the Covid-19 campaign has actually been one of the most ambitious and successful rapid vaccination drives in US history. Pockets of skepticism remain. From a public health perspective, this is unfortunate. From a humanitarian perspective, it is often tragic. Yet, it is important to bear in mind that many have legitimate reasons to be apprehensive towards authorities and skeptical of their advice – and it is possible to effectively mitigate their concerns. Most holdouts are persuadable. Indeed, they are being persuaded every day. Musa al-Gharbi is a Paul F Lazarsfeld fellow in sociology at Columbia University.

2/15/2022,"The government’s proposed new powers to strip people of their citizenship without notice rang alarm bells in communities across Britain. Despite being the first Muslim woman in our country’s history to serve in the cabinet, my family and I could be deprived of our citizenship without being told about it, and cast out of our home country if the Home Office believed this would be conducive to the public good. Two in five people from ethnic minority backgrounds could be at risk. Successive British governments have torn down the basic belief that all British citizens in this country are and should be equal. The consequences of this government’s unprecedentedly broad use of citizenship-stripping powers have become even more clear to me after hearing directly from the families of British citizens detained in north-east Syria.  Last week, the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on trafficked Britons in Syria, of which I’m a vice-chair, published the findings of its inquiry into the grooming and trafficking of British nationals by Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria. What we found is devastating. Not only did UK authorities fail to protect vulnerable women and girls from being trafficked by IS, but the government has essentially punished some of those women for the crimes committed by their traffickers by stripping them of their citizenship. As far as we know, the government made no attempt to assess how the women reached Syria. It simply sent a letter (or filed a letter in a Home Office drawer) stating that they travelled to IS-held territory “of [their] own volition” and had forfeited their right to British citizenship as a result. We heard family members describe the horrific abuse and enslavement their loved ones endured under IS, and their feelings of abandonment and betrayal by the authorities they looked to for support. Many were interrogated and treated like criminals after they reported their loved ones missing. One family was raided by the police after going to them for help. Authorities stopped answering their calls. At the most difficult time in their lives, they had nowhere to turn. Although British women have managed to escape IS territory, they and their children have been abandoned by the government in detention camps in north-east Syria where their lives are in jeopardy. In one detention camp last year at least 163 people died, including 62 children. Instead of repatriating these families – as many of our European allies and the US have done with their nationals – the government has washed its hands of them, by unilaterally stating that these women, born and raised in Britain, are no longer British. In addition to the life-threatening consequences for these women and children and the severe emotional toll on their families, these discriminatory citizenship-stripping policies are eroding many people’s sense of belonging within the UK, especially in the Muslim community. This sense of a new “hostile environment” will only be exacerbated by clause 9 of the nationality and borders bill, which would introduce the power to deprive millions of Britons of citizenship without notice. This would effectively eviscerate the right of appeal. You don’t stand much chance of challenging the deprivation of your citizenship if you don’t know it’s been taken away in the first place. And it would further the appalling situation in which we find ourselves now in Britain that seeks to sentence a predominantly minority black and brown community differently from the majority white community. When my grandfathers fought for the British Indian army, they did so as British citizens. When the Windrush generation answered the call to rebuild Britain after the second world war, they did so as citizens. When south Asian people took up gruelling jobs in the mills and foundries of Yorkshire, as my family did, they did so as citizens, as equal members of our society, in the continuation of a bond that had started decades earlier. Citizenship-stripping powers may feel abstract, but the government’s unprecedented use of them is already having a terrible impact on British families, including children and trafficking victims, as the APPG’s report makes clear. Their abandonment is a blot on our nation’s conscience and should serve as a warning about the potential consequences of further expansion of this vast, unaccountable executive power. In the wake of the Windrush scandal, the government promised to learn from the failures that led to British citizens being unfairly cast out from their homeland. It must end the dangerous misuse of citizenship-stripping powers, or it is doomed to repeat those failures.

2/15/2022,"He’d hate us saying it, but when it comes to national treasures, Armando Iannucci (Scottish, but born to Italian parents) is up there with the best of them. As writer and producer for 1994’s The Day Today, Iannucci was part of the Britpop of comedy: what the Gallaghers, Damon Albarn and Jarvis Cocker were doing for music, Chris Morris, Peter Baynham and Iannucci were doing for satire. Then there’s a certain Mr Alan Partridge, whom Iannucci helped create with Steve Coogan for radio in the early 90s, and who now … well, who wouldn’t have wanted to be invited to Partridge’s oasthouse for an exclusive, post-lockdown haircut interview? After creating and directing the swear-tastic The Thick of It, Iannucci brought Malcolm “Fuckity Bye” Tucker’s political mishaps to the silver screen in 2009’s tremendous In the Loop. Iannucci’s second film – 2017’s The Death of Stalin (with Michael Palin, Steve Buscemi and Paul Whitehouse) – featured less swearing but enough communism for the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw to praise it with five stars as “a ruthless force by an A-list line-up” – but the actual Communist Party of the Russian Federation to label it “revolting” and ban the film in Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.  Iannucci’s third film – the brilliant The Personal History of David Copperfield, featuring Dev Patel – was awarded four stars by Bradshaw as a “bracing, entertaining, richly satisfying experience”.

2/15/2022,"Good morning. Russia’s defence ministry has announced it is to withdraw some of its troops from the border with Ukraine in a possible de-escalation of the threat of a potential invasion.  The size of the withdrawal remains unclear and may involve only a fraction of Russia’s forces at the Ukrainian border, which western officials estimate at more than 60% of the country’s ground forces. The announcement of the withdrawal came in a statement from the defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov, who described ongoing exercises that involved forces from “practically all military districts, fleets, and the airborne forces”. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson and Joe Biden believe there remains “a crucial window for diplomacy and for Russia to step back from its threats towards Ukraine” after a 40-minute call between the two leaders last night. Is this really a de-escalation? Russia has previously announced the conclusion of military exercises near the Ukrainian border, but social media and satellite photography taken in the following days have not shown considerable changes to Russia’s force posture. Is this any different? It’s unclear yet but Russia’s rouble currency reportedly posted gains following the announcement, indicating that investors hoped this would mark the beginning of a de-escalation of tensions between Russia and the west. A report, shared exclusively with the Guardian, provides a snapshot of industry’s involvement in some of the country’s most controversial fossil fuel investments. American private equity tycoons are profiteering from the global climate crisis by investing in fossil fuels which are driving greenhouse gas emissions, an investigation reveals. Oil and gas pipelines, coal plants and offshore drilling sites linked to Indigenous land violations, toxic leaks and deadly air pollution are among the dirty energy projects financed by some of the country’s largest private equity firms, according to an investigation by the corporate accountability non-profits LittleSis and the Private Equity Stakeholder Project (Pesp). Private equity refers to an opaque form of financing away from public markets in which funds and investors buy and restructure companies including startups, troubled businesses and real estate. The findings have renewed calls for greater transparency in the booming private equity industry, so that communities bearing the brunt of toxic emissions and extreme weather can track the money behind the misery. New Yorkers who live in areas where controversial stop-and-frisk searches happen most frequently are also more likely to be surveilled by facial recognition technology, according to research by Amnesty International and other researchers. Research also showed that in the Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens boroughs of the city there was a direct correlation between the proportion of non-white residents and the concentration of controversial facial recognition technology. “Our analysis shows that the NYPD’s use of facial recognition technology helps to reinforce discriminatory policing against minority communities in New York City,” said Matt Mahmoudi, artificial intelligence and human rights researcher at Amnesty International. The research is a part of the global anti-facial recognition technology campaign, Ban the Scan, investigating increasing use of surveillance initiatives in the New York police department (NYPD). How did the researchers work out the link? Using thousands of digital volunteers through the Decode NYC Surveillance project, more than 25,500 CCTV cameras were mapped across New York City. Data scientists and researchers from Amnesty International compared the data on the camera placement with statistics on police stop-and-frisk. Sarah Palin’s lawsuit accusing the New York Times of defaming her by incorrectly linking her to a mass murder was thrown out on Monday. “I think this is an example of very unfortunate editorializing on the part of the Times but having said that, that’s not the issue before this court,” the judge said. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has invoked legislation that gives his government sweeping powers to fight a growing number of “illegal and dangerous” blockades across the country. Trudeau said the measures would be time-limited and only apply to specific geographic regions.

Novak Djokovic says he would rather miss out on grand slams than be vaccinated against Covid, in his first major interview since being deported from Australia.

She was double that age and there was an ocean between us: I was married and living in New York, so when the news came, I couldn’t hold her to me, or be a practical support. I sat on my bed and cried. The next time I saw her, it was all over. One breast removed and carefully reconstructed. The cancer gone. It was only five years later that I found my lump,” writes Laura Pearson. “My body understands I take her for granted, and why wouldn’t I? We are conditioned, as women, to believe there is divine purpose in busyness and distraction – forgetting ourselves, forgetting the soul-needs of our children: the soil, the air, savannas and forests, wetlands and oceans. My body is my collaborator, whether I think about her or not.

2/15/2022,"The debate over a biennial World Cup has been the subject of strong opinions from politicians, sponsors and governing bodies, most commonly in opposition. Now, finally, players have had their say and they appear to be against it too. A survey by the international players’ union Fifpro has found that 75% of players in the men’s game want the tournament to continue on a four-year cycle. It also has good news for organisers Fifa, however, showing that players consider the World Cup to be the most important competition in the professional game, alongside their own domestic leagues.  Compiling the response of 1,000 current professionals from across six continents and more than 70 nationalities, the survey found the strongest opposition to the tournament in Europe and Asia with 77% of players preferring a World Cup every four years; 63% of players in the Americas were opposed too, but there was less resistance in Africa with only 49% of players supporting the current format and the rest split between a two- or three-year cycle. In total, 81% of players rank either their domestic league, or the World Cup as their favourite competition. The results are part of a broader Fifpro study into player workload and the football calendar, with the union having expressed frequent concerns that elite players, especially those playing at international level, face greater risk of injury and burnout from overplaying. “The player survey shows most footballers around the world have a clear preference to play the World Cup every four years,” Fifpro’s general secretary, Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, said. “At the same time, the results demonstrate the importance of domestic league competitions to players. These leagues are the bedrock of our game and we have to do more to strengthen them both for the sake of players and the overall stability of professional football.” Fifa’s plans to reform the World Cup cut across a number of issues for stakeholders, not least the potential revenues a new competition could suck in from elsewhere. Player welfare is a concern too, although Fifa’s proposals – as initially drafted by Arsène Wenger – claim to have a focus on this issue by reducing the number of international qualifying matches and placing them within one or two distinct blocks during a season. With criticism from players joining that of other groups – most vocally Uefa and political bodies elsewhere in Europe – any reforms remain uncertain. Before Christmas Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, drew back from putting the plans to a vote. Another crucial meeting, the Fifa Congress, is at the end of March. The governing body, meanwhile, is continuing to consult with various stakeholders, including Fifpro and the Professional Footballers’ Association, with whom Infantino met in Manchester three weeks ago. After that meeting, Infantino said: “Fifa is listening to everybody. We took note of the valuable opinions and we’re sure this will lead to more constructive exchanges. This is what we wanted from the beginning of this process, to facilitate an open platform where everyone’s view can be brought to the table.”",Sport/Football,Survey claims 75% of male footballers want World Cup to stay every four years,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/15/world-cup-75-per-cent-male-footballers-stay-every-four-years-fifpro-survey
2/15/2022,"A former Conservative minister, once at the heart of efforts to clamp down on money laundering in London, has revealed that during Theresa May’s premiership, No 10 “leant on him” when he tabled amendments to introduce a public register of overseas property owners. Lord Faulks said he had first tried to put the register into the criminal finances bill in 2017 and then again into a government bill on money laundering in 2018. He had described the overseas ownership of dirty money in London as an obscenity.  Faulks, a distinguished barrister and now an independent peer, told the Guardian he was rung by Downing Street during May’s tenure and told to go to a meeting where he met civil servants from four government departments including the Foreign Office, business officials and the Home Office. They told him to drop the amendments – for which he had a voting majority in the Lords – because they assured him Whitehall had the issue in hand. He told the Guardian: “I was obviously misled because nothing has subsequently happened. I can only think a deluded desire to protect the City of London has led to all these delays. “It is a real irony that our reputation for protecting the rule of law is one of the things that attracts people who have very little regard for the rule of law themselves and come from countries which ignore it almost altogether. “Quite frankly, I was leant on. I was leant on by No 10 Downing Street and summoned to a meeting of officials from all sorts of different departments, who told me it was very unfortunate that I was going to do this because the matter was in hand.” He recalls that in return for dropping his amendments he was assured in May 2018 by the Foreign Office minister Lord Ahmad that the legislation on a property register would be passed in 2019 in time for it to be functioning no later than early 2021. He was asked to chair a joint committee of both houses to scrutinise the government draft overseas entities bill, the measure that would bring in the register. The Foreign Office has been approached for comment. His joint committee duly reported in May 2019, stressing that time was of the essence, and proposed improvements including verification checks to ensure that trusts could not be used to disguise the ultimate owners of property. On publication of his report he was assured by ministers that they understood the urgency. Faulks, who has just completed a government commissioned report on judicial review, said “over a period of five years successive ministers have offered me emollient promises that the issue was in hand. What has happened? Absolutely nothing. In the meantime, frankly, we look like a laughing stock. We are not responding to the threat of economic crime. Instead, we are giving away golden visas and the rest of the world must think we simply do not care”. He branded unexplained wealth orders as pathetic, pointing out only four had been issued and said the issue of the resourcing of the National Crime Agency was critical. He pointed out that the idea of a register of overseas property owner had first been aired by David Cameron in 2015 and in a speech to an anti-corruption summit he had convened in 2016. He said perhaps “the climate is now changing because we all hate the Russians now”. A growing number of Conservative MPs are seeking unequivocal assurances that an economic crime bill containing the register will be in the next Queen’s speech, regardless of whether Russia invades Ukraine. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, said the government had done “nothing” to stem the flow of illicit funds entering Britain from Russia and urged ministers to act in order to stand up to the Kremlin. In a Twitter post, he accused Vladimir Putin of running a “mafia-like organisation” and said that ministers should stop turning a “blind eye” to dirty Russian money in Britain. “Dirty money has been an issue for decades but its poison is seeping deeper into our system,” he said. “For decades, Russian companies have used our markets to raise money – equities and debt – to finance the Kremlin.” His committee has reopened its investigation into the breadth of Russian finances in the UK financial system.",News/Politics,"No 10 pressured me to drop anti-money laundering measures, says ex-minister",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/15/no-10-pressure-money-laundering-measures-lord-faulks
2/15/2022,"For years, local gun violence prevention programs have struggled to get long term funding. The people who look out for students on and off US school campus, sit at the bedsides of gunshot wound survivors, and embrace the families of homicide victims, are rarely paid with dedicated public money. Instead many groups survive on unpaid hours, donations and competitive one-off grants. But since 2021 a historic amount of government funding has been made available across the US that can turn the tide. This money comes as US cities are in dire need of intervention and healing resources after a nearly two-year increase in homicides and shootings. Still, this potential windfall also comes with confusion, especially for smaller programs whose staff don’t have the bandwidth to manage tedious, competitive applications without support.  “It’s been a headache, but we’re learning,” said Dante Gaines, a co-founder of 1 Hundred Years Enterprises in Richmond, California, of the grant writing and application processes. “It’s all very tedious, especially when you’ve got three brothers who don’t really know what we are doing.” Gaines and his partners, Lejon Reese and Patrick Scott, met while they were serving decades-long sentences in Folsom State Prison and founded the organization in 2018. Since then they’ve started speaking at a local elementary school, helping other formerly incarcerated people find their footing, and building relationships with the young men most at risk of being on either side of a gun. The trio quit their day jobs to throw themselves into their community work and are mainly operating on donations from family and local residents as well as a contract with the county’s Boys and Girls club, a national youth development organization. They’ve had city and nonprofit grant applications denied in the past but are still applying. Scott says that a consistent injection of funding would give the co-founders more time to innovate and expand their reach. “We’re so worried about how to get funded it takes away from us doing what we’re very good at doing,” he said. “A few years worth of funding gives us enough room to be creative.” Community organizations like Reese’s, Gaines’ and Scott’s have long called for long-term funding. These groups reach the majority Black and Latino residents who bear the brunt of the burden of gun violence in the US, using art and yoga to help people heal from trauma and taking young people on trips out of state. The work requires money for supplies and staffing, but many groups have for years eked by on grants and contracts, volunteer work and donations. Yet money has been scarce because of the red tape involved in government grant applications and oversight, organizers said. If someone does get a government contract or other type of public money it is usually allotted only for a few months or a year, which isn’t enough time to develop the relationship necessary to get someone out of the cycle of violence. Donations and philanthropic funds covered gaps but violence prevention advocates say it’s the government’s responsibility to make sure grassroots healing and intervention groups are able to easily access public dollars. “Philanthropy dollars can fill a gap but those government dollars can sustain the organizations for the long arc. This direct investment is critical,” said Michael-Sean Spence, director of community safety initiatives for Everytown for Gun Safety. The organization’s appeals have found a more receptive audience, however, as homicides began to climb across the US, coinciding with demands for money to be funnelled away from police and toward holistic violence prevention. The money, activists and interventionists hoped, would go to local groups whose staff was entrenched in the streets and had a proven track record of diverting people from violence and helping families and individuals heal. In 2021, after homicides jumped by 30% over the year before, the Biden administration directed counties to use American Rescue Plan funds for violence prevention work and made millions of dollars available through the health and human services, education and housing departments. In California, the budget for the state’s violence intervention and prevention grant program (CalVIP) has been increased by $200m and is available to more cities and programs than ever before. “It took the pandemic of Covid-19 to exacerbate the already debilitating, but forgotten, pandemic of gun violence,” said Julius Thibodeaux, the co-director of Movement for Life in Sacramento. The group used to be an affiliate of Advance Peace, an organization that is now a national model for violence prevention. Thibodeaux says he and his staff began to see more young people involved in gunplay and points to the loss of school and extracurriculars that gave them refuge. “The money is important because we can get them on the right track, but you need the long term support resources to make sure nothing derails them,” he continued. However, the newly available funds do little good if the barrier to entry is too high for small groups to clear. That’s where national organizations hope they can leave their mark. Spence, of Everytown, said his group is helping local groups take advantage of the historic amount of money available at the local, state and federal levels. “It takes time for that change to occur and community programs are not waiting for governments to figure this funding out – they’re meeting needs today,” he continued. “There’s a learning curve on the ground to find the info,” said Greg Jackson, executive Director of Community Justice Action Fund, a national violence prevention group. “Prior to these executive actions we had $5 to $10 million and now we have billions that people can compete for.” For programs like 1 Hundred Year Enterprises, the support that Jackson and Spence refer to couldn’t come soon enough. The founders plan to start working with youth in juvenile detention, recently partnered with the Richmond officials, to hold a series of meetings between Black men who once contributed to the city’s gun violence. They plan to start taking students on excursions that they hope will open their horizons. “It takes much determination and resolve to run and fund a program,” said Lejon Reese. “We’ve lost sleep and sacrificed family time but we have to keep boots on the ground because we’re trying to deter youth from a path that leads to death or jail.”",News/US news,Historic funding could transform gun violence prevention efforts.

2/15/2022,"A sheriff’s department in southern California is encouraging law enforcement officers who oppose vaccine mandates to “take back [their] freedom” and apply for jobs with the department.  The Kern county sheriff’s office released a video last week inviting applications from deputies within Los Angeles county, where officials passed an order that could lead to the termination of thousands of county workers who haven’t received the Covid-19 vaccine or provided a religious or medical exemption. “Drive north, we have a place for you … Kern county is a community that backs the blue,” the minute-long ad says as country singer George Strait sings The Weight of the Badge, a song paying tribute to police. Covid-19 vaccination rates inside the LA sheriff’s department have lagged far below that of the public with just 54% of workers fully vaccinated, despite a vaccination mandate for county employees. Last week the county board of supervisors moved to shift vaccine mandate enforcement power away from LA county Sheriff Alex Villanueva. Villanueva, who has criticized mask orders and said he will not fire workers who refuse the vaccine, said such an act could lead to more than 4,000 unvaccinated deputies losing their jobs. The sheriff’s office in Kern county, a deeply conservative expanse located immediately to the north of Los Angeles, responded with its video the next day. “So take back your freedom, and APPLY today to work at the Kern county sheriff’s office. You deserve a job that welcomes you and your values, with open arms.” The battle over vaccine mandates for law enforcement in southern California highlights the divide over Covid health rules across the state. Vaccination rates continue to lag in more rural and conservative regions of California, where 70% of all residents are vaccinated. Outrage over Covid-19 restrictions led to the ouster of a Republican county supervisor in Shasta county, handing control of the board of supervisors to a militia-supported group. Kern county doesn’t require vaccinations for its workers. Its sheriff, Donny Youngblood, said in a press conference on Friday that he doesn’t know how many of his department’s deputies are vaccinated. Just 52% of Kern county residents are vaccinated, compared to 70% of LA county residents, according to the New York Times. “There’s a substantial number of deputies that already work here that aren’t vaccinated,” he said. “I have no idea [how many] and don’t care,” Youngblood said at the press conference. Though vaccination rates among law enforcement across the state have trailed behind the statewide rate, Youngblood said Kern county specifically wanted to target LA deputies. “The reason we reached out specifically to LA is there will be 4,000 deputy sheriffs if this were to happen that have real families have real children have real bills that could be unemployed because they refuse to take the vaccination.” Youngblood, who falsely claimed the vaccine doesn’t help or stop the spread of Covid, added that his department has 125 deputy positions it is struggling to fill. “Our substations are about half-staffed. And it really boils down to this: when you call 911 and it’s an emergency and you really want a deputy there, are you gonna ask him if he’s vaccinated or not?” Kern county law enforcement has received scrutiny in the past. In 2015, the Guardian found that law enforcement in Kern county killed more people relative to its population than in any other county in the US. Covid-19 was the leading cause of death for law enforcement killed in the line of duty in 2021 across the US, which saw the highest number of line-of-duty officer deaths since 1930. According to a report from the National Law Enforcement Memorial and Museum, preliminary data shows Covid killed 301 of 458 active federal, state, tribal and local law enforcement officers who died last year.",News/US news,LA could fire unvaxxed officers.

2/15/2022,"Krystyna Deuss arrived in the UK at the age of four in 1947 as a refugee from Poland. When she saw headlines about Afghans being airlifted to safety last summer, she wanted to help. Now a Londoner, she had fled with her family during postwar communist rule in the country of her birth. Like many of the Afghans airlifted to safety, her family had had to go into hiding before they fled. Her father was a judge and she said members of the “intelligentsia” such as him were at risk.  As her father had been a judge, she was particularly keen to support somebody in the same profession. As such, she offered a flat in central London to a female Afghan judge and her family. Fawzia and her family were being accommodated in a hotel close to the flat by the Home Office, with her four children being given school places in the area. It seemed like an ideal solution – a place to live at a housing benefit rate in the neighbourhood where the children were already settled into school. However, due to the lack of a mechanism for those who have found their own place to live, the family remains stuck in the hotel. Officials from the local council, Hammersmith and Fulham, have inspected the flat Deuss offered. Although she has made some improvements to the property, which was previously on the open market, such as installing a new boiler, they say further work is required and Home Office funds that could be used to make the changes have not been made available. Deuss, 78, said she was “thoroughly fed up” with the whole saga and would now seek private renters. “I’ve been trying to offer my spacious flat, which is in the perfect location, since September,” she said. “I’ve spent a lot of money on improvements to the flat. I’m now going to give up and rent it on the open market again. I just wanted to help an Afghan refugee family but it doesn’t seem possible.” Fawzia said she and her family would like to move into the flat offered by Deuss, but unless the bureaucratic roadblocks can be shifted, they must remain for an indefinite period in the hotel nearby. “We want to work with the Home Office and the council to try to sort this out,” she said. Stephen Cowan, the leader of Hammersmith and Fulham council, said: “It is shameful that despite the government’s commitment last year to work ‘at speed’ the Home Office has failed to develop an effective resettlement programme for Afghan refugees. “Priti Patel must intervene now to ensure they no longer languish in temporary accommodation and are rehoused to suitable homes as soon as possible. We will continue to play a full part in this.”",News/UK news,‘Doesn’t seem possible’: Londoner who wants to house Afghan refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/does-not-seem-possible-londoner-who-wants-house-afghan-refugee
2/15/2022,"Russia could extend Alexei Navalny’s imprisonment for up to a further decade in a fresh criminal trial that his supporters warn has been overshadowed by the crisis in Ukraine. The Russian opposition leader is accused of embezzling donations to his FBK anti-corruption organisation, which has accused Vladimir Putin of owning a £1bn mansion and other top officials enriching themselves through corrupt schemes.  Navalny has denied the charges and calls them politically motivated. The new trial for embezzlement began on Tuesday inside the IK-2 penal colony in Vladimir, an unusual setting three or four hours’ drive east of Moscow, that severely limits the ability of supporters and observers to attend the hearings. Navalny is serving a three-and-a-half-year sentence at the prison for a separate embezzlement charge. He survived a poisoning attempt on his life in 2020 and was arrested after returning to Russia last year. His family and supporters say the Kremlin is seeking an easy conviction by holding the trial inside a prison colony far away from his support base in Moscow. “[The authorities] want to hide him from all people, from his supporters, from journalists,” wrote his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, in an Instagram post on the eve of the trial. “It is so pathetic that they are afraid to hold the trial in Moscow.” As the hearings began on Tuesday, Navalnaya hugged her husband, who was dressed in a blue prison jumpsuit. Navalny was not held in a cage, as is customary during Russian criminal proceedings, because the courtroom was inside a prison. Maria Pevchikh, another top Navalny ally, has said the danger to Navalny has increased as public attention has increasingly been diverted away from human rights concerns to the potential for a Russian attack on Ukraine. “The danger to Navalny’s life, ie the probability of him being killed in prison, will increase exponentially depending on what happens in Ukraine,” she wrote. “The odds are pretty bad already, but a full-on Russian invasion barely leaves him any chance to survive.” Reporters said those wishing to enter the courtroom were barred from bringing in laptops, phones or recording devices. Navalny is accused of embezzling donations to his anti-corruption fund, which has spearheaded investigations into government officials and sparked large anti-Putin protests for years. He is also accused of contempt of court for allegedly insulting a judge during a previous trial, where he had been accused of slandering a military veteran. The government has also sought to disband Navalny’s national political network, opening criminal cases against his top aides and regional coordinators and by declaring his political network as extremist. Many of his closest allies have been forced into exile. A documentary film about Navalny, who narrowly survived an apparent poisoning attempt with novichok, premiered at the Sundance film festival earlier this year. The 90-minute film, simply titled Navalny, featured fly-on-the-wall footage of the Russian opposition leader, filmed during the several months he spent in Germany in late 2020 as he recovered from the poisoning.

2/15/2022,"Thousands of Afghans rescued from the Taliban remain stuck in UK hotels, after a minister admitted there was no mechanism to move some of them on without losing government support. The Home Office recently revealed that keeping Afghans in hotels was costing the taxpayer £1.2m a day. Hotel rooms are not suitable for long-term accommodation for traumatised people who have fled persecution, and prove a particularly challenging environment for families with children.  On 1 December, the Afghan resettlement minister, Victoria Atkins, told parliament that more than 4,000 Afghans had either been resettled or been matched with accommodation. More than two months later, that figure remains around the 4,000 mark. When the Home Office, working with local authorities, finds accommodation for Afghans brought to safety, it gives councils £20,520 per person in resettlement money over three years to help with community integration. However, any of the 12,000 Afghans still languishing in hotels who find their own accommodation cannot automatically access this support. Tim Naor Hilton, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said this stasis “fails to meet the expectations the British public rightly had” when they “watched Afghans clinging desperately to planes during the fall of Kabul”. In a statement to the Guardian, Atkins said: “We are exploring all options to ensure families who move out of bridging hotels into self-arranged accommodation receive the appropriate support.” She added: “Due to an unprecedented cross-government effort, and in partnership with local authorities and the private rented sector, we have already matched or are matching approximately 4,000 evacuees to homes. “We continue to pursue every avenue to secure permanent homes so Afghan families can settle and rebuild their lives. Afghans recognised as having a legal right to reside in the UK are immediately entitled to access essential services including education, NHS healthcare, employment opportunities and universal credit.” She pledged that all Afghan citizens brought to the UK under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) and the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme (ACRS) would have the right to work, access to education and healthcare and would be able to apply for public funds. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, condemned the delays and lack of flexibility in the Afghan resettlement scheme. “The government has clearly struggled to establish an effective partnership with local authorities to quickly move Afghans into long-term homes in the community. “It’s imperative that all families are given the support they need to rebuild their lives and do not miss out on being well settled into local communities regardless of which route they choose to find a home.” Sara Nathan, co-founder and trustee of the charity Refugees at Home, which recruits hosts with spare rooms to provide interim accommodation for asylum seekers and refugees, said her organisationhad not been able to help any resettled Afghans. “When the Afghan evacuation happened, it really touched a sympathetic nerve and 1,600 people applied to host with Refugees at Home,” she said. “It’s incredibly frustrating that, months later, we haven’t been able to place any Afghans because of the risk they will lose Home Office support and local authority sourced housing longer term. “So people are stuck for months in unsuitable, expensive bridging hotels when they could be hosted, cooking for themselves, integrating and becoming used to their new lives.”",News/UK news,Thousands of Afghans stuck in UK hotels as resettlement plan stalls,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/thousands-of-afghans-stuck-in-uk-hotels-as-resettlement-plan-stalls
