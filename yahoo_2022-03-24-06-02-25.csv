3/24/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Otto Toto Sugiri was already a multimillionaire after selling his company to Indonesia’s largest telecom operator. Then he spotted a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

To ensure data security, the government was planning a law requiring online information to be stored in Indonesia rather than abroad. That meant a huge need for local data centers. So Sugiri, along with six partners, founded PT DCI Indonesia, the company that’s become Indonesia’s leader in the field with more than 200 clients. Since its listing last year, DCI shares have shot up more than 10,000%. Now Sugiri, 68, is not just a multimillionaire. He’s one of the world’s richest people with a fortune estimated at $2.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. “I still love eating Gado Gado,” he said in an early March interview from DCI’s data center in Cibitung, near Jakarta, referring to the traditional dish often found at roadside stalls. “Being rich won’t change me.” Sugiri owns 30% of DCI, while co-founders Han Arming Hanafia and Marina Budiman, who also serves as the company’s president commissioner, have stakes valued at $1 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. Indonesian tycoon Anthoni Salim, whose empire spans food to telecom and real estate, is DCI’s fourth-biggest shareholder with an 11% stake. Sugiri, who keeps his gray hair long and has a preference for black tops, began his career as an IT programmer in Germany after graduating from an elite university in Aachen, a city near the Belgium and Dutch borders known for its spas and curative hot springs. He moved back to Indonesia in the 1980s and did some programming for local companies before joining his family’s lender, PT Bank Bali -- now called PT Bank Permata -- where he helped set up its IT department. After six years at the bank, Sugiri left to head PT Sigma Cipta Caraka, the software company that PT Telkom Indonesia took over in 2007, landing him a windfall. In 1994, he set up PT Indointernet, Indonesia’s first internet-service provider, of which he still owns 17%. In all, he’s founded more than 20 companies. DCI has benefited from a digital transformation in Indonesia, whose population of 270 million is primarily young and web-savvy -- the online economy reached $70 billion last year, up 49% from 2020, according to a report by Google, Temasek Holdings Pte and Bain & Co. With a 62% market share, DCI’s profit surged 43% last year and revenue rose to 871.2 billion rupiah ($60.7 million). But the company’s success -- it was the world’s best initial public offering in 2021 -- led to controversy. The jump in the thinly traded shares prompted exchange halts and an investigation into stock manipulation. While the probe cleared DCI of wrongdoing, Sugiri and his co-founders pledged to not to part with their shares, switching their holdings to untradeable stock last August. “We don’t want people to think we are trying to influence the market,” Sugiri said. “It is part of our commitment as founders.” Sugiri said he’s open to selling more of his stakes -- though for now not in the data center. He has investments in tech companies including e-commerce firm PT Tokoplas E-Commerce Indonesia, service provider PT Fortress Data Services and crypto marketplace PT Indodax Nasional Indonesia. Last year, he and his DCI co-founders offloaded 47% of their ownership in Indointernet at a valuation 42% higher than its IPO price. “I don’t have the ambition to hold companies for my whole life,” Sugiri said. “Philosophically, the company is only a means for humans to create something useful and for the good of humans.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Silicon Valley’s Wealthiest Russian Is Carefully—Very Carefully—Distancing Himself From Putin China Bets on $1.5 Trillion of Tax Cuts in Quest for Growth The Future of Boosters Is Somewhere Between Unnecessary and Urgent Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•yesterday,"Bet of a Lifetime's 10,000% Surge Made Indonesian Man a Billionaire",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bet-lifetimes-10-000-surge-180000403.html
3/24/2022,"Tesla's (TSLA) Berlin Gigafactory is now live, and it will be super important to the EV giant's future, analysts say. On Tuesday, the factory received CEO Elon Musk, who presented customers with the first Model Ys made at the facility. Tesla's new factory is 20 or so miles southeast of the German capital and houses roughly 10,000 employees. The factory cost north of $5.5 billion to construct. ""We view the opening of Giga Berlin as one of the biggest strategic endeavors for Tesla over the last decade and should further vault its market share within Europe over the coming years as more consumers aggressively head down the EV path,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said. ""We cannot stress the production importance of Giga Berlin to the overall success of Tesla's footprint in Europe and globally, as the current Rubik's Cube logistics of producing cars in China at Giga Shanghai and delivering to customers throughout Europe was not a sustainable trend. The Berlin factory establishes a major beachhead for Tesla in Europe with potential to expand this factory to production of ~500k vehicles annually with Model Y front and center over the coming 12 to 18 months."" Ives adds the opening of the site removes an ""overhang"" on the stock. The analyst rates Tesla Outperform with a 12-month price target of $1,400. The factory should also help Tesla compete more aggressively with European behemoth Volkswagen, which is making a huge EV push, Vollkswagen Group of America President and CEO told Yahoo Finance Live Monday. While Tesla unwraps its shiny new factory, Wall Street analysts are speculating the company has other bold moves up its sleeves. ""In our view, the chance that Tesla does not ultimately offer products and services to the eVTOL [electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft]/UAM market is remote. The potential skills transferability and network adjacencies are too strong to ignore,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a new research note. Jonas believes the segment would be called ""Tesla Aviation,"" and be a logical evolution of the company's prowess making electric vehicles. It would also tap into a potentially lucrative market. By 2030, Morgan Stanley estimates the total addressable market (TAM) for the eVTOL industry in the U.S. could reach $12 billion, powered by interest in non-fuel powered short haul aircraft. Looking out to 2050, the investment bank projects the global eVTOL market could be worth $9 trillion as companies and government seek ways to reduce road congestion via a green-friendly option. Morgan Stanley's Jonas thinks eVTOLs are just one area Tesla will venture into the decades to come. Another promising venture could be Tesla's auto operations collaborating with CEO Elon Musk's other companies, such as The Boring Company and SpaceX.
