3/17/2022,"A teenage boy accused of murdering five-year-old Logan Mwangi allegedly confessed to pushing the child down a flight of stairs a year before he died, leaving him needing hospital treatment, a jury has heard. Logan’s mother, Angharad Williamson, reported the incident to police, pleading: “This is too much for me to handle … I need help,” Cardiff crown court was told. The teenager, who cannot be identified, is on trial for Logan’s murder alongside Williamson, 30, and Logan’s stepfather, John Cole, 40. Logan was found in the River Ogmore in south Wales on 31 July last year with more than 50 injuries to his face, head and body. The jury heard on Wednesday that Logan plunged down a flight of stairs in August 2020, sustaining what his mother thought was a dislocated shoulder. Williamson tried to pop the shoulder back into place and put Logan to bed but had to take him to the Princess of Wales hospital in Bridgend the next morning because his arm was still floppy. Medical staff flagged up concerns and a police officer spoke to Williamson, who told them she thought Logan had fallen. In January 2021, however, Williamson rang police to report that the teenage defendant had admitted pushing Logan downstairs, the court was told. She told a call handler: “I’ve only just found out.” She said Logan sustained a broken arm in the stair incident. A statement from Logan’s father, Benjamin Mwangi, was read to court in which he described the moment he was told of his son’s death. He said officers came to the bookmakers where he worked in Essex and told him the news. “I was hysterical. I fell to the floor,” he said. Mwangi said the day Logan was born was “the happiest time of my life”. He said he and Williamson were together for about two and a half years in total, and he stayed in contact with Logan for some time after their relationship ended. However, by the time of Logan’s death his contact with his son had lessened after Cole had said he was contacting Williamson too much. A learning support officer at Logan’s primary school, Wendy John, described the boy as a “happy, caring, loving, intelligent child”. John said she noticed a change in him when he returned to school when Covid lockdowns were lifted. “I noticed his stammer got worse and noticed he had lost weight and had dark circles around his eyes,” she said. Williamson and the teenager deny murder and perverting the course of justice, while Cole denies murder but admits the second charge.

3/17/2022,"To those who have been discussing the efficacy of prayer (Letters, 14 March), I would recommend a look at a 2006 Harvard study into praying for sick people, which was funded to the tune of $2.5m by the Templeton Foundation, an American philanthropic organisation. Scientists studied 1,800 patients using double-blind testing, which was recognised as being rigorous and reliable. Of the three groups tested, there were no discernible results in two of them; in the third group, some people who were really ill and knew they were being prayed for got worse – not many, but statistically measurable.

3/17/2022,"A couple who were seriously injured during a rollercoaster crash at Alton Towers have got engaged. Leah Washington and Joe Pugh were riding the Smiler rollercoaster when it crashed into a stationary carriage in 2015. Washington posted pictures on Instagram showing her engagement ring during a trip to Venice. She wrote: “So this happened yesterday … I SAID YES.” Pugh also confirmed the news on Instagram, posting: “Venice 2022, the best city break so far, made even better by getting a yes from Leah.” The couple had been dating for about a month when they decided to go to Alton Towers in 2015 and their rollercoaster carriage crashed into a stationary carriage on the same track at 90mph. Washington, who was then 17, had to have her leg amputated above the knee, and Pugh, then 18, also sustained serious injuries, including two shattered kneecaps. The pair, from Barnsley in South Yorkshire, were among 16 people injured in the crash at the Staffordshire theme park on 2 June. The passengers were left trapped more than 20 feet from the ground at an angle of about 45 degrees before they were eventually freed by emergency workers and stretchered away. Speaking after the incident in 2015, Washington told how she feared she would die in the moments afterwards and described the “blur” of waking up in hospital and being told her left leg had been amputated. A 2016 investigation into the incident concluded that the crash was caused due to inadequate health and safety protocols, and Merlin Attractions, the owner of Alton Towers, was fined £5m for health and safety failures. The judge, Michael Chambers QC, said that the safety procedures were “woefully inadequate” and a “shambles”, and that the crash was “a needless and avoidable accident in which those injured were fortunate not to have been killed or to have bled to death”. The judge rejected Merlin Attractions’ claim that the crash was caused by human error, but rather that it was caused by the company’s “catastrophic failure to assess risk and have a structured system of work”. On top of the initial fine, Merlin Attractions made interim payments to cover medical and physiotherapy costs. Lawyers said the fine was believed to be the largest ever of its kind for a leisure industry company. Five people were seriously hurt. Both Washington, then 17, and Vicky Balch, of Leyland, Lancashire, had to have a leg amputated. Washington, who has amassed over 27,000 followers on Instagram, uses her platform to share her experiences and progress as an amputee. She also became the face of the lingerie brand Pour Moi in 2021. Washington wrote about how the incident “changed her life for ever” on a post marking five years since the incident. “I can’t believe how quick five years have gone and obstacles I have overcome since that day and the amazing opportunities that have arisen for me,” she wrote on Instagram. “I want to thank my friends, family and boyfriend for your continued support throughout everything.”",News/UK news,Couple hurt in Alton Towers rollercoaster crash get engaged,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/16/couple-hurt-in-alton-towns-rollercoaster-crash-get-engaged
3/17/2022,"The “spectacular grift” documentary is a subgenre of the (particularly Netflix) true crime genre that is threatening to overshadow its originator. In rapid succession we have had Inventing Anna (about the fake German heiress Anna Delvey, who took most of Manhattan’s elite for a ride), The Dropout (the story of the biotech entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes, who built the multi-billion dollar firm Theranos on the back of fraudulent claims, and The Tinder Swindler (about pretty much exactly what it said on the tin). And now we have Bad Vegan: Fame. Fraud. Fugitives (Netflix), the story of how one woman was so gullible that she let a man she met online persuade her to drain $2m from her Manhattan raw-vegan restaurant, because he claimed he could make her beloved dog Leon immortal. That, at least, is – roughly – the marketing headline. Variations on it made the actual headlines too, during the weeks when restaurateur Sarma Melngailis went, again as the media had it, on the run with Anthony Strangis (who was then her husband), while owing large sums of money to various investors and her staff. However, it was – would you believe – a bit more complicated than that, as this unhurried but fascinating four-part documentary does a fine and careful job of explaining. The bulk of it comprises an extensive interview with Melngailis herself. Her account is supplemented by testimony from family members, staff, friends and investors (not that all those roles were mutually exclusive – she seems to have been generally loved and respected by those who knew her before Strangis appeared on the scene). They watched with increasing confusion and powerlessness as the catastrophe unfolded. Melngailis, an astute, hardworking businesswoman and former financier at Bear Stearns was riding high on the success of her restaurant and other outlets specialising in vegan raw food (I know – apparently not a thing they just made up for that episode of Sex and the City). But she was at a low point in her personal life when she met Strangis online. Although he was then calling himself Shane Fox, possibly to distance himself from the wife and child he had left behind and the legal trouble he had caused by impersonating a cop and committing grand theft. I wouldn’t start rolling your eyes just yet. You really need to pace yourself for this one. She fell in love with him online, she says, and although he looked a bit heavier when they met in person, she thought it would be shallow to let that affect her feelings for the man. She didn’t see too much of him anyway – as a black ops specialist (he hinted), he was always off travelling to places and situations he couldn’t divulge. Occasionally, he would ask her to wire him money to get him out of tight spots while he was away. She complied, eventually, with staff wages and other money taken illegally out of the business. Gradually, he built an increasingly bizarre alternative reality around her, giving her to understand that they were being constantly surveilled by his malevolent big brother, and that some semi-mafiaesque, semi-divine entity called “The Family” required her to prove her faith in him in order to protect her. All she had to do was obey his orders and wire him any sum of money he asked for without question, and she would ascend to some ineffable “next level”, securing her own and Leon’s immortality. Recordings of their conversations show him furiously berating her, and when she does stand up to him, we hear her doing so in the flat, affectless voice of the already-beaten. Those with any experience or knowledge of psychologically abusive and coercively controlling relationships (Strangis was also isolating her from colleagues, friends and family) will find much that is familiar in her story and in their conversations. Whether, even then, you can quite believe how far Strangis was able to move her window of normality is a question probably every viewer will answer slightly differently. This is very much Melngailis’s show and she is allowed to skate too easily away from whether, when and how she could have – should have – realised what he was doing, and escaped his clutches. Is it victim-blaming to pose those questions? Or is understanding how someone – especially someone with every social and educational advantage – can be so brainwashed by a bully the very essence of the matter? At the very end – too little, too late really – the idea is floated that the marriage actually began as a ploy by Melngailis, to ensure Strangis paid off her restaurant debts – as he had promised early in their relationship. So, another possible reality emerges to compete with the multiple others constructed by Strangis during their time together, by the footage of recollections from Melngailis and others, by the media in various incarnations throughout the whole saga. Who knows precisely where the truth lies? I suppose if Leon outlives us all we’ll have an answer. ",Arts/Television & radio,Bad Vegan: Fame. Fraud.

3/17/2022,"For four long years members of the US Congress had to smile or scowl as a TV star played the role of president. Donald Trump became infamous for the art of lying. On Wednesday another TV performer turned national leader came before Congress. But this one captivated his viewers with truth telling.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a former actor and comedian facing down the Russian war machine, has an instinctive understanding of the camera but is proving a more serious man for more serious times.Despite being under siege in Kyiv, Zelenskiy has been on a virtual tour of western capitals over the past three weeks, tailoring his speeches to each nation. Speaking virtually to the British parliament, he cited William Shakespeare and Winston Churchill, while he asked members of its Canadian equivalent to imagine waking at 4am to bombs dropping on Ottawa’s airport or Toronto’s CN Tower. The Axios website described it as a “signature blend of praising, chastising and pleading with his audience to understand the global stakes of Ukraine’s resistance” which has produced unexpected commitments such as oil and Swift banking sanctions.So it was that in a packed auditorium in the basement of the US Capitol in Washington, Zelenskiy, whose words were translated from Ukrainian into English by a female interpreter, conjured the demons of two days when America was attacked from the skies to renew his plea for a no-fly zone above Ukraine.“Remember Pearl Harbor, the terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you,” said Zelenskiy, looming large on a cinema screen, wearing perfectly trimmed hair and beard and a green T-shirt, against a white backdrop with a Ukrainian flag to one side. “Remember September 11, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn your cities, independent territories, into battlefields. When innocent people were attacked from the air. Our country is experiencing the same every day, right now, at this moment. Every night for three weeks now … Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people.” Combined with references to Mount Rushmore and Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream speech”, Zelenskiy, was pushing America’s most emotive buttons with words. But he also knows that this is the nation of network television, cable news, Hollywood, Netflix and social media. So words alone would not do. Zelenskiy asked the members of the House of Representatives and Senate to watch a searing video compilation showing the hell that Russian troops have rained down on Ukraine and its citizens. It contrasted idyllic images of children playing in peaceful towns and cities with explosions, destruction, sobbing, refugees, hospitals and corpses, accompanied by the lament of a violin. According to a pooled report by the Associated Press, “As Zelenskiy played the video of violence, the room was very quiet and members were mostly still. Some shook their heads or wiped eyes or took video. Small amount of applause afterward.” Then came a simple message written in white letters on a black backdrop: “Close the sky over Ukraine.” Tragic in the truest sense because this is the one thing that Congress, and Joe Biden, will not do, fearing that a no-fly zone, in which US pilots shoot down Russians, could trigger a third world war. Perhaps aware of this reluctance, Zelenskiy did not dwell on the issue for long, pivoting to a request for surface-to-air missile systems and urging Washington to “do more”. But the video had a wider purpose. It was shown to millions of American TV viewers just after 9am. It caught TV executives by surprise and they did not have time to censor it; some anchors apologised for its graphic content. It spread far and wide on social media. In the court of public opinion, the video humanised the victims and conveyed the message that our struggle is your struggle. Zelenskiy had again shown himself to be a master of the medium, inviting comparisons with Vladimir Putin’s efforts to lie low, clamp down on media, crush all dissent and turn Russia into North Korea. Zelenskiy is running rings around Putin in the soft power arena with his speeches and intimate phone videos; Russia is not faring especially well with hard power either. On Wednesday the Ukrainian president ended his speech by addressing the room in English. “Now, I’m almost 45 years old,” he said. “Today my age stopped when the heart of more than 100 children stopped beating. I see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths.” There was also a direct appeal to Biden: “I wish for you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.” The auditorium erupted in a bipartisan standing ovation. Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator, tweeted: “There’s no member of Congress left that room without thinking what more the United States can do to stop this carnage. Just a gut wrenching speech. #SlavaUkraine.” In an era of Trumpism, fake news and disinformation, Zelenskiy, who used to play a fictional president, had cut through with his sincerity. For him and Ukraine, it already feels like a third world war; that is their truth. And the temptation for America to flex its superpower muscles is stronger than ever.",News/World news,Zelenskiy captivates viewers with truth telling in address to Congress,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/volodymyr-zelenskiy-addresses-congress-truth-telling
3/17/2022,"The UN’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague has ordered Russia to halt its invasion of Ukraine, saying the court had not seen any evidence to support the Kremlin’s justification for the war, that Ukraine was committing genocide against Russian-speakers in the east of the country. The court ruled by 13 votes to two for a provisional order that “the Russian Federation shall immediately suspend military operations that it commenced on 24 February 2022 in the territory of Ukraine”. Only the Russian and Chinese judges on the court voted against the order. The court president, US judge Joan Donoghue, said the court “is not in possession of evidence substantiating” Russian allegations of genocide on Ukrainian territory. In any case, she said it was “doubtful” the Genocide Convention gives any authority for the “unilateral use of force in the territory of another state”. Consequently, she said “the court considers that Ukraine has a plausible right not to be subjected to military operations by the Russian Federation”. ICJ rulings are binding under the UN Charter, and the court order noted they “create international legal obligations for any party to whom the provisional measures are addressed”, but it has no means of enforcement. It is unlikely to influence Putin’s choices, but it does provide an authoritative refutation of his frequently used pretext for starting the war. “Ukraine gained a complete victory in its case against Russia at the International Court of Justice,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a tweet. “The ICJ ordered to immediately stop the invasion. The order is binding under international law. Russia must comply immediately. Ignoring the order will isolate Russia even further.” The order was in response to a Ukrainian appeal to the court on 26 February, asking for an urgent ruling on Russia’s unsupported claims that Ukrainian forces were committing genocide in Russian-backed enclaves in Luhansk and Donetsk, regions in eastern Ukraine, as a justification for the attack. Russia did not attend an initial hearing of the case on 4 March, nor did its lawyers turn up to hear the ruling on Wednesday. Instead they sent a letter to the court claiming the ICJ did not have jurisdiction over the case, because Russia had formally justified the attack in a letter to the UN secretary general on grounds of self-defence, not on genocide. Donoghue ruled that “the non-appearance of one of the states concerned cannot in itself constitute an obstacle to” a provisional ruling. She also rejected Russia’s argument on jurisdiction under the Genocide Convention, pointing out the frequent occasions that Vladimir Putin and other senior Russian officials had claimed the alleged genocide was the reason for the attack. “The court concludes that prima facia it has jurisdiction pursuant to article nine of the Genocide Convention to entertain the case,” Donoghue said.",News/World news,UN International Court of Justice orders Russia to halt invasion of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/un-international-court-of-justice-orders-russia-to-halt-invasion-of-ukraine
3/17/2022,"She’s free! In a world overwhelmed by woeful tidings, the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after six years of hell in Tehran provides a rare moment of joy. Yet when the cheering stops, there will be many questions to answer – such as why now, and why on earth did it take so long?Pleasure and relief over this sudden breakthrough will be deservedly felt, first and foremost, by Nazanin’s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, and their seven-year-old daughter, Gabriella. The family of another British-Iranian detainee, Anoosheh Ashoori, are celebrating his freedom, too. But Morad Tahbaz, a British-Iranian-American, has not been so fortunate. Although he has been released and placed on furlough inside the country, Iran is reportedly treating him as an American citizen and thus part of a separate negotiation with the US. During an ordeal that never seemed to end, Richard Ratcliffe’s tirelessly intelligent, passionate campaign for his wife’s release won the respect not only of the British public, but also of a too secretive Foreign Office. Whitehall mandarins prefer to handle such matters privately, behind closed doors.But their softly-softly approach, genuinely intended to avoid antagonising the Iranians, seemed only to embolden them. Hardliners such as Sadeq Amoli Larijani, a former chief justice who presided over Nazanin’s unjust, illegal incarceration, and his like-minded deputy, Ebrahim Raisi, who was elected president last year, are chief among the guilty men. Another is Boris Johnson. As foreign secretary, he disastrously misrepresented Nazanin’s activities in Tehran. But despite this, Ratcliffe kept going. His very public hunger strike last autumn showed again his determination not to let her plight drop out of the headlines. Now his love, tenacity and courage – and hers – have been rewarded at last. Of the many unanswered questions surrounding this affair, one of the most pressing was whether, despite denials on both sides, the payment of an acknowledged £400m British debt to Iran was indeed the price of Nazanin’s freedom. Confirmation has now been made that the debt has been paid, with the money ringfenced for humanitarian purposes. So it appears the government, de facto, has just paid a ransom for the release of hostages in contravention of stated principles. Or are we really expected to believe these two supposedly unconnected issues have been dealt with in parallel and separately? Before Johnson and Liz Truss start taking bows for springing Nazanin and Anoosheh, they should also explain why it all took so long. Why was the debt repayment withheld if it would be paid later? Were the years of delay, during which time Nazanin suffered extreme psychological torture and physical hardship, entirely due to bloody-minded Iranian intransigence? Or is it true, as many suspect, that Nazanin’s case became inextricably mixed up with broader western concerns relating to the US-Israeli stand-off with Iran under Donald Trump, with competing attempts to salvage or torpedo the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, and with complex negotiations involving American-Iranian detainees? This week’s breakthrough coincides with rising hopes that a revised nuclear deal will soon be agreed. Following the Ukraine invasion and subsequent western action to curb Russian energy imports, the US and Europe suddenly have a powerful incentive to lift sanctions and allow Iranian oil and gas back into a damagingly overpriced market. Perhaps Nazanin, a victim of these protracted nuclear wranglings, is now a belated beneficiary of their prospective resolution. She may also have benefited from being disentangled by British negotiators from ongoing, so far unsuccessful US attempts to secure the release of four or more American citizens, including the unfortunate Tahbaz. Iranian state TV quoted unnamed sources in May last year claiming Washington had agreed to pay $7bn for four detained Americans. At the same time, it said the UK would pay its debt in return for Nazanin. The US denied the report, British officials declined to comment, and nothing happened.Then, last month, MPs were told the UK had indeed signed an agreement to secure Nazanin’s release last summer, but it had fallen through. No reason was given – but it was suggested it was because the US side of the deal had not been agreed. This time, unlike last summer, it seems Britain, quite rightly, has not waited for an American OK.Such murkiness aside, there are clear questions for Iran’s rulers to answer, too. The treatment of Nazanin and her fellow detainees is and was unforgivable. What kind of bent and twisted government exploits the misery of innocent people, using them as hostages for crude political ends? Is this really how Iran proposes to build its influence across the Middle East? Why, if a new nuclear deal is agreed, has the west any reason to trust this rogue regime?

3/17/2022,"The murder crisis gripping Mexican journalism has claimed another life after a journalist was gunned down in the conflict-stricken state of Michoacán just six weeks after he announced the murder of a colleague. Armando Linares López, the director of a news website called Michoacán Monitor, was reportedly shot at least eight times on Tuesday afternoon outside his home in the city of Zitácuro. He is the eighth Mexican journalist to be killed in 2022, compared with nine in the whole of last year. “Words fail me,” tweeted Jan-Albert Hootsen, the Mexico representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists, after hearing of the latest murder in what he called a “staggering, excruciating” crisis facing Latin America’s number two economy. Hootsen said he had spoken to Linares after the murder of his colleague, Roberto Toledo, in the same city on 31 January. Linares reported his colleague’s killing in an emotional video, saying that Toledo had been targeted for exposing corruption. “We don’t carry weapons. We only have a pen and a notebook to defend ourselves,” he said. After the murder, Linares grew concerned for his own safety. “He told me that he had received threats, that he was concerned about his safety,” Hootsen said. On Tuesday Linares’s worst fears were confirmed when he was killed by assassins who remain on the loose. More than 90% of such crimes go unsolved in Mexico, which is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists outside war zones. Speaking at his daily press conference on Wednesday, Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, insisted authorities were responding to the crime. “We are already investigating,” the president, who is best known as Amlo, told reporters, although few members of Mexico’s media have faith in the government’s ability to stop the wave of killings targeting journalists. In a statement, one press activist group from Michoacán slammed the Mexican government’s “apathy” towards the murders. “There are no words to describe the anger, impotence and disgust we feel over the growing number of murders of journalists in Mexico and in Michoacán,” they wrote. The murders – several of which have taken place outside journalists’ homes – have sparked an outcry in the world of journalism as well as growing international condemnation. Last week members of the European parliament voted overwhelmingly to condemn the murders and denounce López Obrador’s use of populist rhetoric “to denigrate and intimidate independent journalists, media owners and activists”. The MEPs claimed such behaviour was contributing to “an atmosphere of relentless unrest towards independent journalists”. López Obrador, who – like his fellow regional populists Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro – is notorious for attacking the media, took the criticism badly. In a statement that the president helped write, Mexico’s government said the MEPs were the “sheep” of “reactionary” conservative “coup-mongers” supposedly trying to undermine López Obrador’s nationalist government. The posture of Amlo – whose attacks on the media have grown in recent weeks – has sparked outrage among journalists at a time when so many of their peers are being killed. On Wednesday morning journalists took to the streets of Michoacán’s capital, Morelia, to protest, clutching banners that read: “You can’t kill the truth by killing journalists” and “No more murders! Do not shoot!”",News/World news,Eighth Mexican journalist to be killed in 2022 is shot outside his home,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/armando-linares-lopez-mexican-journalist-killed-eighth-2022
3/17/2022,"Michael Gove has said he is “not convinced” by the case for more fracking in the UK, opening up a cabinet split after Boris Johnson ordered a rethink and Jacob Rees-Mogg backed reversing the moratorium. Gove, the levelling up secretary, made the comments at an environment reception, where he also spoke of the need for more onshore wind power. Onshore wind is blocked in many cases by planning restraints as the rules make it easy for communities to object. But Gove’s brief now encompasses planning, raising the possibility he could use reforms of the system to make it easier for onshore wind projects to gain permission. Casting Vladimir Putin in the role of a “pusher” of oil and gas fuelling an addiction to hydrocarbons in the west, Gove told the reception: “The only way you can wean yourself off the addiction is to diversify the sources of energy we have. The only way to diversify our sources of energy is if we ensure that we continue to invest in renewables, onshore and offshore wind, solar power and also look at the potential of hydrogen in the future, if we allow nuclear to be part of the mix and recognise that hydrocarbons have a role to play but a diminishing one over time.” Ministers are exploring the case for reversing the ban on fracking after No 10 ordered a new energy strategy amid soaring prices and the global move to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas. The UK is phasing out Russian oil by the end of the year and looking to cut out gas as well. However, the Guardian revealed this week that very few MPs said they would be happy with a fracking site in their own constituency. When asked if they would support fracking in their seats, only five of the 138 MPs said they would. Forty-one said they would be against it, while the rest did not reply, or declined to comment. There is also still uncertainty over the fracking wells owned by the oil and gas production company Cuadrilla, which is planning to concrete them over within weeks. Johnson has told the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, that it does “not make sense” to seal its shale gas wells. His spokesperson also opened the door to a shift in the UK’s position last week, saying that “all options” would be considered before the forthcoming energy strategy was completed. However, no moves have yet been made to reverse a notice issued by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) that both wells must be plugged with cement by the end of June. The government has instead indicated to Cuadrilla that it is welcome to apply for an extension to keep the wells open. Before last week, the government had repeatedly insisted there was no case for fracking. Greg Hands, a business minister, also struck a negative note in the House of Commons on Tuesday, saying: “Even if the pause were lifted, there are unlikely to be sufficient quantities of gas available to address the high prices affecting all of western Europe and it would certainly have no effect on prices in the near term.” In contrast, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for Brexit opportunities, had also signalled support for a change in policy in cabinet and in public. On his Moggcast podcast, he called shale gas “very clean” and appeared to dismiss concerns about tremors caused by drilling. He said: “Some of the seismic effects are ones that can only be measured with sophisticated equipment. Others are equivalent to a bus passing by your house, assuming there’s a pavement in between you and the house. And as I say, it’s not the San Francisco earthquake.”",News/Environment,Michael Gove ‘not convinced’ by case for more fracking in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/16/michael-gove-not-convinced-by-case-for-more-fracking-in-uk
3/17/2022,"Rishi Sunak has been accused of using a “stealth tax” on incomes that will bring in more than double the amount he budgeted for, as the cost of living rises at the fastest rate for three decades. Ahead of the chancellor’s spring statement to the House of Commons next week, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said rapidly rising inflation means the Treasury could raise £13bn more than anticipated by freezing the income tax personal allowance and higher rate threshold. It said the four-year freeze, announced by Sunak at the spring budget last year, had been expected to bring in £8bn for the exchequer by dragging millions of workers into paying more tax. However, the Treasury estimate was based on a far lower inflation rate than now forecast amid Britain’s unfolding cost-of-living emergency. With a dramatic rise in energy bills pencilled in for this April and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine driving up gas prices to record levels, the IFS said freezing the income tax thresholds would now bring in £21bn for the public purse. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, said: “With much higher inflation forecasts, it looks like being a massive £21bn tax rise – two-and-a-half times bigger than intended.” That means that the policy is now expected to be a £21bn tax rise – on top of next month’s NICs rise (£13bn).This underlines the danger with freezing thresholds for long periods: unexpected changes in inflation can make the policy much bigger or smaller than initially intended. pic.twitter.com/TShlcqtDwP Under the plan announced last spring, the personal allowance – the level above which workers start paying income tax – will be frozen at £12,570 from the beginning of next month until 2026. The threshold for higher-rate income tax – when workers start paying 40% instead of the standard 20% rate – will be frozen at £50,270 over the same period. The plan was controversial with low-tax Conservatives uncomfortable with the chancellor lifting the tax burden to the highest sustained rate since the end of the second world war. However, Sunak has defended the measures as fair and responsible ways to deal with record levels of government debt incurred during the coronavirus pandemic. At the time of the spring budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility – the Treasury tax and spending watchdog – estimated the plan would bring as many as 1.3 million more people into paying income tax and 1 million more into paying at the higher rate. Although wages are rising – meaning more people will pay higher rates of tax – pay is failing to keep up with soaring inflation. Official figures show that inflation-adjusted pay, excluding bonuses, fell at the fastest rate in eight years in January. Experts now say significantly more people will face heftier tax bills. Sam Robinson, a senior researcher at Bright Blue, an independent thinktank for liberal conservatism, said: “Freezing income tax thresholds is a poorly targeted measure, which would increasingly benefit more affluent individuals. After the events of the last few months, we need bold policies that deliver targeted support for those who need it most during this cost-of-living crisis.” The chancellor is also under pressure to scrap his manifesto-busting rise in national insurance contributions announced last autumn, which is due to come into force next month and is expected to bring in about £12bn. Labour and several prominent Conservative backbenchers have urged Sunak to change course at the spring statement to help Britons with surging living costs. Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “We’re facing a horrible stealth tax on our incomes, which will cost us far more than we ever expected. “Freezing income tax thresholds in a time of wage inflation is going to have a far bigger impact than anyone initially thought, and hit us just as hard as we initially thought the national insurance hike would.” The Treasury has been contacted for comment.",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak accused of imposing £21bn ‘stealth tax’ on UK workers,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/16/rishi-sunak-accused-of-imposing-21bn-stealth-tax-on-uk-workers
3/17/2022,"Dominic Cummings has accused Boris Johnson of lying over claims that intelligence officers’ security concerns about giving a peerage to a Russian media magnate and son of a former KGB were overridden. The prime minister dismissed as “simply incorrect” reports last week that he tried to intervene to hand Evgeny Lebedev a seat in the House of Lords and law-making powers for life against the advice of UK spy agencies. While Johnson was on a trip to the Middle East, Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister, stood in at prime minister’s questions and dismissed as “sheer nonsense” concerns raised over the appointment process. But Cummings said Raab had been “given duff lines” and that he, Cummings, knew that the suggestion there was no wrongdoing was false. “I was in the room when the PM was told by Cabinet Office officials that the intelligence services and other parts of the deep state had, let’s say, serious reservations about the PM’s plan,” Cummings, the prime minister’s former chief aide, wrote in a blogpost. “I supported these concerns and said to the PM in his study explicitly that he should not go ahead. He was very cross and as he does when cross he blustered nonsense.” Cummings claimed Johnson told him: “This is just … You’re just … [pause] anti-Russian.” Cummings said the prime minister stopped talking to him about the issue and “got a stooge to creep into the Cabinet Office labyrinth and cut a deal”, citing similarities with his behaviour over attempts to get donors to pay for his flat refurbishment. The House of Lords appointments committee, which is meant to scrutinise the nomination of new peers, was given a “sanitised/edited/redacted” version of the security reports, Cummings claimed. “I’m confident in predicting nobody would swear under oath the PM is telling the truth – including the PM,” he added. The controversy around Lord Lebedev’s appointment was reignited last week with a Sunday Times story headlined “Lebedev got peerage after spies dropped warning”, which followed previous reporting in the Guardian and Byline Times. Lebedev insisted in the aftermath that he was not an “agent of Russia”. Johnson also came under fire at PMQs when comments he made in 2015 – after Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea from Ukraine – resurfaced. The then mayor of London argued that the UK should continue to cooperate with the Russian leader on foreign policy, suggesting it was not “morally irresponsible” to strike deals with Putin. In an article written in December 2015, soon after MPs voted to approve airstrikes in Syria to target Islamic State (IS), Johnson recalled having been in Paris and seen posters bearing Putin’s face on billboards with the caption “our new friend”. “Many French people think the time has come to do a deal with their new friends the Russians – and I think that they are broadly right,” he said. Johnson said that while he believed the UK should work together with Russia to target IS, he was “no particular fan of Vlad”, whom he called a “ruthless and manipulative tyrant”. “Does that mean it is morally impossible to work with him? I am not so sure. We need to focus on what we are trying to achieve. Our aims – at least, our stated aims – are to degrade and ultimately to destroy [IS] as a force in Syria and Iraq. That is what it is all about,” he said. Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, said the Conservative government had long ignored the issue of over-reliance on Russia, forcing Johnson now to go “cap in hand from one dictator to another, on a begging mission for the Saudi prince to bail him out”. She added: “The government have had 12 years to end their reliance on foreign oil and invest in homegrown energy to secure our supplies. Their failure has left us all vulnerable, reliant on another murderous dictator to keep the lights on and pumps open.” Asked when Johnson’s opinion about the wisdom of doing deals with Putin had shifted, the prime minister’s spokesperson could not say. But he pointed to the recent acknowledgement that the west had “collectively made mistakes” in dealing with Putin. “We have seen by his actions that this is a corrupt state that is carrying out an illegal war,” the spokesperson said.",News/Politics,Dominic Cummings accuses Boris Johnson of lying in Lebedev row,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/16/dominic-cummings-accuses-boris-johnson-of-lying-in-lebedev-row
3/17/2022,"The country that an American spy couple tried to sell nuclear submarine secrets to last year has been revealed to be Brazil. Jonathan and Diana Toebbe, a suburban couple who lived in Annapolis, Maryland, were arrested last October and charged with attempting to sell the design of US nuclear-powered submarines to someone they thought was a representative of a foreign power – but who turned out to be an undercover FBI agent. The identity of the foreign power had remained concealed until now. According to a Brazilian official and others familiar with the investigation, Jonathan Toebbe approached Brazil nearly two years ago and offered to provide classified documents he had stolen from the US Navy Yard in Washington, the New York Times reported. Toebbe, who planned for years to sell the information to a foreign power, had worked for the US government since 2012. He held a top-secret security clearance and specialized in naval nuclear propulsion, according to the FBI. At one point, he was assigned to a laboratory in Pittsburgh that focused on nuclear power development for the US navy, said officials. The FBI’s investigation into the Toebbes began in December 2020 when the FBI received a package addressed to a foreign country. It included operational manuals and technical details. According to court documents, the package was intercepted in the Brazilian mail system and rerouted to an FBI legal attache. “Please forward this letter to your military intelligence agency,” a note accompanying the package read. “I believe this information will be of great value to your nation. This is not a hoax.” The FBI proceeded to initiate an encrypted conversation with the Toebbes who offered highly classified navy secrets in exchange for $100,000 in cryptocurrency. A person familiar with the investigation told the New York Times that although the US government wanted to initially disclose the name of the involved country, Brazilian officials did not want their cooperation to be publicly revealed. A senior Brazilian official told the outlet that Brazil cooperated with American investigators because of close bilateral relations and friendly relations between the intelligence services. Brazilian officials and the FBI cooperated after Jonathan Toebbe was hesitant to perform a dead drop, a method of passing information using a secret location. According to court records, Toebbe wrote to his contact, who was in fact an FBI undercover agent, “I am concerned that using a dead drop location your friend prepares makes me very vulnerable … For now, I must consider the possibility that you are not the person I hope you are.” He then asked his contact for “some physical signal you can make that proves your identity to me”. “I could plan to visit Washington DC over the Memorial Day weekend. I would just be another tourist in the crowd. Perhaps you could fly a signal flag on your roof? Something easily observable from the street, but nothing to arouse an adversaries [sic] suspicion?” With the cooperation of Brazilian officials, the FBI undercover agent told Toebbe to look for a signal in the window of a Brazilian government building in Washington last year during Memorial Day weekend. Toebbe saw the sign and agreed to deliver the sample of secrets in a peanut butter sandwich to West Virginia. He and his wife were arrested six months later. Speaking to the Guardian, one former intelligence official who requested anonymity said, “What’s striking is the level of cooperation to place a signal inside the embassy and ​that he refers to himself as an amateur when his tradecraft was quite sophisticated.” In February, the Toebbes pleaded guilty to espionage charges.

3/17/2022,"When I was 13 years old, I was really into Michael Hutchence. I would cut photos of him into heart shapes and then sticky tape them to my skin, where I approximated my own heart to be. I would secretly wear him like that all day, under my school shirt. This is a mildly mortifying memory, but having a crush on a celebrity heart-throb is the kind of thing you do when you are 13. Many of us have a Michael Hutchence in our past. Then you grow up, peel off the paper hearts, pull down your posters, and donate all your embarrassing band T-shirts to Vinnies. You age out of the depth of feeling that can inspire you to stick someone’s face to your body. I grew up too, and if I ever gave any thought to my old penchant for Michael Hutchence, it was only to wince at the thought of who I used to be. I would wince, also, at the thought of taping anything to my now papery skin, which was stretched loose by age, irresponsible sun exposure, and all the babies it once contained. But then the weirdest thing happened to me, a grown woman, an old bag. I felt these same feelings again. I got one of those intense, actual crushes on a person you only know from the television and the pages of magazines. The skin might have changed on the outside, but on the inside, it turned out, I was still the same. Benedict Cumberbatch was my new Michael Hutchence. Middle-age was the new adolescence. What was once a mildly mortifying memory was now a very alarming lived reality. I can’t really explain why it was Cumberbatch, in particular, who reignited my apparently smouldering passion for celebrity heart-throbs. Maybe it was just a case of right place, right time, right cheekbones. I was stuck at home with two young children when it happened, and disappearing – bit by bit, day by day – into the roles of wife, mother and cleaner. On one of these days, much like any of the others, I sat down to watch an episode of the BBC’s Sherlock, which stars Cumberbatch, a man I had seen a hundred times before. But for some reason, a man I’d seen a hundred times before suddenly looked different. Feelings I’d previously labelled as the malformed offcuts of adolescent development sparkled like new. I wanted an explanation, or a diagnosis even, for this ridiculous (and frankly embarrassing) regression. I spent a long time looking for one, speaking to many other women who’d found themselves in the same situation, who had fallen for Cumberbatch like they were 13 again. I wanted to know what it said about me. What kind of mother did it make me? What kind of wife? But the more women I spoke to, the more obvious it became that falling for Benedict Cumberbatch wasn’t the only thing we had in common. They were all so shockingly happy. There was such an abundance of joy among them – among us – that I would end these conversations with my cheeks sore from smiling too much. An explanation no longer seemed necessary, for who wouldn’t want this? I had spent so long cringing at the memory of my adolescence, I’d forgotten along the way how good it actually feels to really lose yourself in something you love. And with so little time and space in my life outside motherhood, I’d forgotten what it was like to “waste” my time on something which wasn’t in service to other people’s needs, something which had absolutely no purpose. Aside from, you know, fun. My feelings about Cumberbatch were only for me, and that felt indescribably good. I just had to excavate that good feeling out from under all the shame and embarrassment I’d piled on top of it, over how weird and inappropriate it was to be a middle-aged woman with a teenage crush. What a mess I’d made of my pleasures, to let my sense of self be determined by my roles – wife, mother, cleaner – rather than by what brought me joy. After leaving high school, I never once felt the absence of a paper heart, but I can see now that something was missing all that time. I no longer feel the same way about Hutchence, but I know I have the capacity to still feel, in that same way. One heart-throb replaces another, fads and fashions change. But how much do we? This is Not a Book About Benedict Cumberbatch by Tabitha Carvan is out now in Australia, NZ and the UK, and in the US on 31 May.",Arts/Culture,I thought I was past teenage crushes.

3/17/2022,"In July last year, Anna’s* real estate agent called to say that her landlord had decided to sell the house in Bega, in the state’s south, where she and her partner had lived for the past two years. The deadline to move out – a few months later in September – came well before her lease was due to expire, but under New South Wales’ “no grounds” eviction rules she and her partner had no choice but to move out. But when the time came to hand in the keys, Anna was told the landlord had changed his mind. “They said ‘the owner doesn’t want to sell [now]. He wants to give it to someone else to rent’,” she told the Guardian. “I said, ‘well, couldn’t we have had longer?’ They didn’t really answer. They just took the keys.” In the past two years, regional NSW has borne the brunt of triple-digit rent increases as waves of tree-changers spurred into the regions during the pandemic combine with long-running housing supply shortages. Data compiled by CoreLogic shows that nine of the top 10 rent increases since January 2020 in NSW came in postcodes outside of greater Sydney, while the city’s fringe also experienced significant price jumps. The steepest rent rises came in the state’s south, including the districts surrounding the border town of Albury, where rents jumped from between 30.5% and 42.3% in some areas. Coming off a low base, it’s seen rents rise by more than $100 in many suburbs. It has prompted reports within the sector of an increase in what’s known as “no grounds” evictions, meaning landlords are not required to provide any reason for terminating a lease. Leo Patterson Ross, the chief executive of the Tenants’ Union of NSW, said he had seen a massive increase in the number of evictions like Anna’s during the pandemic, due to what he called the “waves of displacement” caused by rising rents in regional parts of the state. “We saw a doubling of people calling about no grounds evictions in the regional areas because people are being pushed out to make way for the flow of people moving out of the cities,” he said. “We know rent rises fastest when tenancies turn over, so if someone is evicted without grounds there’s a double whammy because the person knows there’s very little alternative stock. “They end up either paying more, or they inadvertently push up the cost somewhere else by moving even further out to find something affordable.” That’s borne out by rental prices in areas in Sydney’s fringe. In the well-heeled southern highlands retreat of Bowral, rents rose by 33.6% in the past two years as Sydneysiders flocked for a change of scenery. It had a flow-on effect in neighbouring towns such as Moss Vale, which saw an increase of 29.3%. In both towns the median rent grew between $167 and $218 for a house. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On the state’s Central Coast, north of Sydney, rents have also boomed. In Terrigal, rent jumped by almost 30% to a median of $837 a week, up from $645, at the same time as nearby suburbs saw similar rises. That can have significant impacts on pre-existing residents. Last year, the advocacy group Shelter NSW released a report conducted by the Regional Australia Institute seeking to calculate housing needs across regional parts of the state. By comparing factors such as rental and mortgage stress, social-housing availability, and the proportion of single-family households, it calculated the regions with the highest housing need. It found the Central Coast at the top of the list.

Cathy Callaghan, a senior policy officer from Shelter NSW, said the report showed that rent prices alone were not the only indicator of issues with housing cost. “It’s about looking under the averages,” she said. “I think one of the things to look at with rental stress is not just about how much rent is but, when people’s income have been very flat, and the casualisation of the workforce has become so prevalent, there’s a lot of people out there who are just piecing a living together and barely getting by.” After they lost their Bega property, Anna and her partner were unable to find a new home for months, and lived in a tent for two months as they searched for somewhere to live. In the end, they were forced to head further south, to Pambula, to find a property. “It made me feel like a bad person, like, I don’t know, we paid rent on time all the time, we did everything right, it was a run-down old house, we did it up when we moved in, it just, disappointed me – kind of like I did the wrong thing.” *Not her real name CoreLogic only considered postcodes with a minimum of 20 rental observations.",News/Australia news,‘He wants to give it to someone else’: rent rises leaving a toll on regional NSW,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/he-wants-to-give-it-to-someone-else-rent-rises-leaving-a-toll-on-regional-nsw
3/17/2022,"Aged care workers are struggling to obtain the government’s promised $800 bonus which the cash-strapped sector is being asked to pay to staff before their funding applications are approved by government. In January, the government announced it would give 265,000 aged care staff a maximum of $800 in two instalments ahead of the election, responding to pressure over its handling of the pandemic and the underpayment of the sector’s workforce. Employers were told to make applications for the payment from 1 March for eligible workers who were active in the industry on 28 February. Providers are being asked to pay the money to their workers at the time they lodge applications with government. Doing so would require the sector, which the royal commission last year found to be seriously underfunded, to pay out the bonuses before their claims for the money are assessed and approved by government. So far, the government has received just 322 applications, all of which are still being assessed. That’s a fraction of the 1,650 expected by the time applications close in early April. The design of the scheme has hindered workers’ early access to the payments, according to the Health Services Union and the United Workers Union, which both represent aged care workers. Gerard Hayes, the secretary of the HSU, said the government had been warned, repeatedly, about the issues limiting access to the scheme. The first and most obvious hurdle, Hayes said, was that many providers – particularly not-for-profits – did not have the capacity to pay out bonuses to workers while they waited for their claims to be assessed by government. “The for-profits, there’s not many of them, I can see they might dip into their profit margin,” he told the Guardian. “But the not-for-profits, I’ve got no idea where they would get the money to facilitate this. “The reality is this is just a lot of show and not a lot of go.” The aged care director for the UWU, Carolyn Smith, said the impression workers were given after Scott Morrison’s announcement in January was that the payments would be delivered promptly after 1 March. “So there’s just a level of frustration and anger,” she said. “It’s just been compounded by this overly bureaucratic and slow process.” She said it had also become clear that some parts of the aged care workforce – including lifestyle and contracted cleaning workers – were excluded entirely from the payment. The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, said his department had been encouraging aged care providers to pay their workers “as soon as they submit the application to ensure staff are paid promptly”. “This is an arrangement solely between the provider as the employer and their employees,” he said. “It is a demand-driven grant – 322 applications have been received to date.” He said the government expected to receive applications from 1,650 providers for more than 265,000 workers at a cost of $210m. The bonus scheme is modelled on the $393m aged care workforce retention payments that were granted in the early stages of the pandemic in 2020. Payments will vary depending on the number of hours worked. Each instalment is a maximum of $400. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The HSU is still waiting on a decision in the Fair Work Commission on its case for a pay rise for aged care workers of 25%, or at least $5 more an hour. Providers and unions have reached an in-principle agreement on a pay rise. They have noted that whatever pay increase the Fair Work Commission orders, it should be “fully funded by the federal government and linked to transparency and accountability measures as to how funding is used”.",News/Australia news,‘Lot of show and not a lot of go’: aged care workers struggling to get Morrison government’s $800 bonus,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/lot-of-show-and-not-a-lot-of-go-aged-care-workers-struggling-to-get-morrison-governments-800-bonus
3/17/2022,"An eight-year long project to map the massacres of people on the Australian frontier is the “first sustained effort to break the code of silence” on the violence of colonisation, its lead researcher says, but the full story is yet to be told. The true picture may never be known because “the code of silence about massacres has been universal”, according to emeritus Prof Lyndall Ryan from the University of Newcastle’s frontier massacres research project. “[The map] is not definitive, because so many massacres were hidden and people have never talked about them, but this is the first time we have a national map that has a clear method of investigation,” Ryan says. “This is just what we’ve found so far. It’s a first serious look on a national scale, and I think it will just provide the opportunity for other researchers, whoever they might be, to look further.” A seasoned historian who has researched and written about the violent colonial history of Tasmania and Victoria, Ryan says she was “astonished” by the extent of frontier massacres across Australia. “I really did not expect to find the numbers that we have found. And we know that the numbers we have found are simply indicative, rather than definitive.” She says there are many other sites of conflict that are not on the map. “We’ve come across stories and incidents that have a lot of substance, but simply don’t meet the criteria at the moment.” The criterion is her decision to include on the map sites only cases where a minimum of six people were killed, known in global genocide studies as a “fractal massacre”. “We had to stick with six, because we wanted to keep it relevant to the international literature, and the international work on massacre generally,” she says. “The killing of any person in this way is a shocking crime. There is no question about that. “But massacre has a particular meaning and implication. It’s a mass killing. It’s planned, it’s deliberate and it has great consequences for the community who survive. Many communities don’t survive a frontier massacre, it has a terrible impact.” Ryan concedes this made the work more difficult and was a source of criticism. She says future research on incidents where fewer than six people were killed is essential, particularly in Queensland, where such cases were extremely common. “Certainly, my historian colleagues in Queensland have been very anxious to say, your map of Queensland is not giving us a clear picture of really what was going on, where you’ve got small numbers of people on both sides, say three to five people being killed by Aboriginal people, and white people killing three to five Aboriginal people. And that, for many Queensland historians, is what the story of the frontier war in Queensland is all about. “I’m taking a national approach. And I still think that Queensland comes out with the greatest number of massacres of any part of Australia, marginally more than the NT, and I’ve been shocked by what we’ve found in the Northern Territory.” The research team has received more than 700 messages over the past eight years, providing feedback and, occasionally, crucial family archives that contain proof of massacres. “People have contacted us over the last eight years with information or querying what we’ve done, or suggesting that we’ve missed out on important information, providing more information so in a way we’ve all been learning about how to research frontier massacres, and how to get the data as accurate as possible.” “I think it’s been a national learning project, in a way.” The Killing Times is based on data from the Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project led by Prof Lyndall Ryan at the University of Newcastle’s Centre for the 21st Century Humanities.

3/17/2022,"Threatened duck species were among those killed on the first day of Victoria’s hunting season – the longest in four years – reigniting calls from animal advocates for an end to the practice. Wildlife Victoria’s lead veterinarian, Natasha Bassett, who joined rescue teams at Lake Connewarre near Geelong on Wednesday, said the first duck she treated was a female blue-winged shoveler. Hunters are prohibited from shooting both the blue-winged shoveler and hardhead ducks in Victoria this season, given both were recently listed as threatened due to declining populations. The duck had suffered fractures to its radius and ulna, meaning it would not be able to fully extend its wing to fly and had to be euthanised. A male blue-winged shoveler was also found dead by rescue teams. “This is the eighth year that I’ve been out on the wetlands doing this triage work,” Bassett said. “The shock in the first few years was really very strong. Now I just feel a disappointment that it’s still going on and there doesn’t seem to be a will to do the right thing and end it like other states have done.” She said only a small fraction of injured birds were treated by the triage team, given most flew away injured. “You hear the shot and then you see them drop a few feet in the air and there’s just like a little beat in their wings and you know they’ve been hit but they’ve still got the strength to disappear [in] a couple of kilometres,” Bassett said. “Then they’ll come to ground at some point, they’ll take cover in the reeds and eventually, when they lose strength, they’ll drown or a fox will get them. It’s just a terrible way to go.” Bassett is a licensed shooter and insists she’s not a “soft city vet”. “My concerns are about the cruelty of it. We don’t just allow people to wander into a flock of sheep in the paddock and shoot, there’s standards, practices and obligations under legislation,” she said. Duck hunting is banned in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, but the practice continues in Victoria, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Tasmania. Victoria’s season began on Wednesday, and will run until 13 June, with a daily bag limit of four birds. It is the longest season since 2018, with last year’s going for just 20 days in recognition of lower-than-average bird numbers and breeding. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In its submission to Victoria’s Game Management Authority, RSPCA Victoria called for a cancellation of the 2022 duck hunting season, based on animal welfare concerns and evidence that waterbird numbers are in decline. The latest Aerial Survey of Waterbirds in Eastern Australia showed overall waterbird numbers were approaching the low of the millennium drought, when Victoria suspended its duck hunting season from 2007 to 2008. It found game species abundances were well below long-term averages with six out of eight game species showing significant long-term declines. The Animal Justice party MP Andy Meddick, who was also at Lake Connewarre on Wednesday, described day one of the hunting season as “carnage”. “What I witnessed today on the first day of Victoria’s duck shooting season was appalling. Shooters were wounding birds and not even bothering to retrieve them, which is illegal,” Meddick said. “Myself and other rescuers did our best to find wounded birds among the reeds, but it is a difficult job. “There is nothing more distressing than hearing an injured bird and not being able to get to them. The ones we couldn’t find could suffer for days, even weeks, before dying of infection or drowning.” He said it was hard to believe the Andrews Labor government, which has a strong social-policy agenda, supports duck shooting. “Day one of Victoria’s duck shooting season was defined by illegal activity and the maiming of threatened species. What will it take for Daniel Andrews to finally act?” Meddick said.

Several Labor MPs, including Lizzie Blandthorn, Josh Bull, Jordan Crugnale, Katie Hall, Dustin Halse, Gary Maas and Steve McGhie, publicly support a ban, while Meddick said senior cabinet ministers have privately told him they want an end to the sport. The Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, said it was clear the government had put the interests of the shooting lobby above the safety of the state’s native ducks. “It’s time for this government to wake up and recognise duck shooting for what it is: glorified animal cruelty,” she said.",News/Australia news,Threatened duck species killed as extended Victorian hunting season begins,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/threatened-duck-species-killed-as-extended-victorian-hunting-season-begins
3/17/2022,"Karen Thorne’s rental home heats up as soon as the morning sun hits her east-facing bedroom in the Sydney suburb of Rosemeadow. “I could wake up at 8am to 28-degree heat in there,” Thorne said. “The heat is what actually wakes me up.” Thorne’s bedroom is at the front of the home, but it’s the back bedrooms, which receive the full glare of the afternoon sun, that get the hottest. Thorne’s 19-year-old son took to sleeping on the kitchen tiles over summer because the heat in his room was unbearable. “I’ve recorded on my own thermometer before – it actually reached up to 38 degrees in there one day, and it didn’t cool down until 2am in the morning. That’s why [son] Connor likes to perch on the floor in the lounge room, or in the kitchen. I am just grateful I have an en suite so I don’t trip over him in the night,” Thorne said. Thorne’s story is one of 49 captured in Hot Homes, a new report by tenants advocacy organisation Better Renting, illustrating renters’ experiences of heat and heat management in their homes over the past summer. The organisation recruited 49 renters around Australia to install temperature monitors in their houses from 1 December to 22 February, which measured minute-by-minute changes. Even in this relatively mild summer characterised by La Nina conditions, including increased rainfall and cooler daytime temperatures, the researchers found causes for concern. Homes were routinely exceeding the recommended safe maximum temperature of 25C, with household temperatures across the country between 25C and 30C for 38% of the time. Temperatures above 30C were recorded 4% of the time on average. The houses also retained heat for a long time overnight, with temperatures hot enough to impair sleep 45% of the time. In the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland, the temperature inside the renters’ homes was between 25C and 30C more than 50% of the time. In the Northern Territory, the tracked homes only dipped below 25C for 4% of the time. The report follows calls in February for mandatory minimum building and rental standards that allow tenants to keep their homes sufficiently cool. No jurisdictions in Australia have explicit requirements for cooling devices in rental properties. Recent changes to rental laws in Victoria, for example, include a requirement for landlords to provide a fixed heater in “good working order”. But there is no comparable requirement for cooling. Extreme heat is the leading cause of natural hazard fatalities in Australia, killing more people than all other natural disasters put together. According the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the number of days of extreme heat has increased five-fold in the past 30 years. Some of the renters who monitored their household temperatures for Hot Homes reported experiencing extreme heat indoors, even when the outdoor temperatures were relatively mild. Kate Fox, who rents with and cares for her elderly parents in an apartment in Chermside, Brisbane, recorded a maximum indoor temperature of 37.5C over the summer, despite the apartment having only been built in 2017, having an air conditioner installed, and fans placed throughout. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Fox said the cooling mechanisms were offset by the box-like balconies that trapped sun glare, and open windows being in close proximity to other apartments’ air conditioners expelling hot air. “After it gets to a certain heat, up to about 28 degrees, you actually can’t cool it down. There’s no air flow through the windows. We had two fans in every room and it just wasn’t enough. We’d have cold showers. We couldn’t eat. We were just in this bubble of hot air,” Fox said. She was concerned about the effect the relentless heat was having on her elderly parents. “It’s hot like this for months at a time which, when people are very old and disabled, is very concerning,” she said. “Particularly for my father, he’ll spend weeks at a time just in a daze.” The Hot Homes report found this was a common problem among those who lived in new dwellings, leading researchers to suggest the standards set by the National Construction Code – which is currently under review – were inadequate, made assumptions about resident behaviour that did not bear out in practice, and didn’t adequately take into account the changing climate. Thorne’s house also has an air conditioner installed, but it has required repair since 2020 – work which has not been completed. Thorne said she has not been allowed to install her own blinds or shutters, and there are no trees on the property that shade the house. “I’m pretty disgusted in the way things are as far as renters are concerned. If you’re paying money to live in a property with features that were advertised in the lease notice, you should be able to use those features,” Thorne says. Better Renting’s Joel Dignam said trying to manage constantly stifling temperatures had knock-on effects in other areas of renters’ lives, including their mental health and their performance at work. “These effects come from a sense of powerlessness. People talking as if their home is their enemy and they have a need to escape from it. That’s cumulative stress,” Dignam said. Renters also reported they felt powerless to speak up about the heat in their homes – even to request reasonable repairs, let alone alterations or new features be added to a property – for fear of eviction or retaliatory action such as rent increases. Dignam said there was scope to make minimum rental standards more explicit, which may help tenants in seeking modifications to the property. “Landlords have an existing obligation to keep their property ‘habitable’” he said. “But if we can make it more concrete – there’s got to be bathroom ventilation, fly screens on windows, ceiling insulation, etc. – that makes it easier for tenants to know where they stand.” The report could be seen as a warning, Dignam said. “The summers we’ve experienced already demonstrate the impact of climate change, but this was a mild one. We are really concerned about what this means for future summers, which we know will be longer and hotter. We’ve got time to realise this is a problem and do something about it, but it’s really something we need to get on to now.”",News/Australia news,"‘It reached 38 degrees’: rental properties across Australia routinely exceeding safe temperatures, study reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/it-reached-38-degrees-rental-properties-across-australia-routinely-exceeding-safe-temperatures-study-reveals
3/17/2022,"“I overthink what I need to say, and then I don’t say anything. Maybe it’s more useful just to talk.” So says Australian musician Courtney Barnett in the revealing new documentary Anonymous Club, a film so intensely personal it almost borders on claustrophobic, as we enter the anxious mind of one of Australia’s most loved contemporary rock musicians. Directed by longtime friend and Melbourne film-maker Danny Cohen, and shot beautifully on 16mm film, Anonymous Club feels like a series of Polaroids: captured moments, sometimes fleeting, with some details a little blurry. Following Barnett over a three-year period of touring, recording and working on her recent album, Things Take Time, Take Time, it’s narrated by the musician in voice notes she recorded herself. As the famously shy artist reveals her fears, the short audio clips are juxtaposed with footage of her accepting major music awards and playing to huge crowds around the world. That jarring dissonance lies at the heart of this film: how can a notoriously private person exist in such an incredibly public career? What impact does that have on mental health, self-perception and the creative process? There is a sense of loneliness, too; when we don’t see her working, Barnett is often shown on her own. Cohen recorded almost 30 hours of footage, and then cut it to a slender 83 minutes. It’s a pleasure to follow along on tour, visiting landscapes from around the world and more familiar places, too, including Melbourne’s Corner hotel. But the film is just as much about what is not shown. One particularly arresting moment follows a confession about feeling unable to write – “My heart is empty, my head is empty, the page is empty,” Barnett says. For a minute or so, there is nothing on screen at all, just blackness. The viewer looks into the void, soundtracked by a raw, impassioned acoustic performance: Barnett’s pain is audible in her trademark yowl as she sings, “I don’t wanna be here.” Anonymous Club can feel like listening in on someone’s therapy sessions. Barnett is frank about her headspace, and it’s clear she’s not comfortable recording her thoughts. Considering the confessional nature of much of her music (“I’m having trouble breathing in,” she sings on the chorus of her panic attack anthem Avant Gardener) or the outright fury of a song like I’m Not Your Mother, I’m Not Your Bitch, it may seem a little surprising that Barnett is so reticent about her personal life. But the documentary touches on imposter syndrome, and the inherent strangeness of performing as a job. “It feels like I’m being part of this scripted performance of what we think we’re supposed to see on stage, and it just feels really pointless,” Barnett says at one point. At another, she cries on stage. Because the film is so internal, focused more on feelings and concepts than action, it does sometimes feel a little repetitive. But that, too, is an accurate representation of the experience of anxiety – the same things over and over and over, an inner monologue on repeat. The musician’s relationship with her art is in flux throughout, and she admits that her understanding of her own songs changes as she does. But despite the anxiety that permeates Anonymous Club, it ends ultimately on a hopeful note, as Barnett realises her purpose as an artist, as a person. “My albums won’t be with me on my deathbed holding my hand,” she says near the close of the documentary. “This film will not be with us as we lie dying – but I’d like to think in the bigger scheme of things, it will live on and help other people, or inspire other people, or create some sort of conversation.” Anonymous Club is in Australian cinemas from 17 March ",Arts/Music,Courtney Barnett’s Anonymous Club review – a deeply intimate portrait of creativity and anxiety,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/17/courtney-barnetts-anonymous-club-review-a-deeply-intimate-portrait-of-creativity-and-anxiety
3/17/2022,"There are atrocities documented on the Killing Times map that are literally unspeakable. I tried telling a friend about what took place at Malakoff Creek in the Northern Territory and found I could not say the words out loud. The incident was monstrous. It sits heavy in my heart and remains lodged there, probably permanently. I read all 415 entries on this map over the past three years, and it was the worst. One of the researchers on this project, who has spent almost eight years of their life immersed in this history, says the cumulative effect of living with this knowledge for so long makes words useless. I say this not from any ghoulish interest in the depravity of the frontier but because it is part of the problem. How do we find the words to talk about this? It’s not as though the frontier history should come as a surprise. On the map are at least 47 sites that had names directly related to what happened there – Skull Hole, Massacre Falls, Butchers Creek. Everyone knew this story, even if they preferred to deny it. Many Aboriginal children grew up knowing what happened because our elders told us. We got the Captain Cook myth at school, and the truth at home. Out in the world we saw the amnesia that grew from the denials that have stunted our history and ignored our pain reach its annual peak on 26 January. To hear Australians say, even now, they had no idea this happened is in equal parts shocking and exhausting. It is a measure of how far they will have to be dragged towards the truth. So, in blunt terms, this map and this project is history for white people. Aboriginal people already know what happened and, in many cases, are tired of talking about it. Because sharing their pain does not guarantee the most important thing: justice. I’m not talking about the truth-seeking of a national commission, or annual performative acts of apology, but a whole range of meaningful processes self-determined by Aboriginal people that result in the return of power, authority, resources and decision-making to First Nations. Things like – but not limited to – reparations, a voice to parliament, constitutional reform, legislative changes, language revival, protection of sacred sites, an end to over-policing and over-incarceration, family safety and child restoration, land back. Justice. In the 1990s I was part of the small team that conducted the Bringing Them Home inquiry. Day after day we heard the stories of children, now adults, who were ripped away from their families. Our hearts broke. As a national truth-telling project, Bringing Them home has undoubtedly changed the way Australians understand the history of forced removals during the so-called Protection era, the sustained efforts to assimilate and breed us out. But today our children are removed from our families at greater rates than ever before. The royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody was a truth-telling project, too. Yet at least 500 Aboriginal people have died in police and prison custody since its recommendations were handed down more than 30 years ago. Aboriginal people know all too well that justice hasn’t followed truth. This map and the horrors it contains are just part of a fuller picture of the nation. It is, in the words of lead researcher Prof Lyndall Ryan, just the start. It is an eight-year effort to collect some details about our past, details the researchers could verify according to an agreed methodology. It is now a snapshot, a guide for future researchers to follow and critique, to build on or break down. Ryan says it is the start of “breaking the code of silence” held by white people, among white people, about the way Australia was made. In with the horrors are stories of defiance and resistance, bravery, kindness and compassion, that need to be told and celebrated. Our descendants deserve to know the full history of their nation. We have to look at it all, and find the words to talk about it all, and the outcome must be justice. Truth and justice processes look different in different places. They are starting to take shape around the country in different ways. Some are further along the line than others in developing justice processes that enable truth telling. In Victoria, the Yoo-rrook commission is due to report in June. There are treaty processes under way in the Northern Territory and Queensland to set the terms of engagement, to explore ways to enshrine and protect First Nations’ rights to land, culture, language and family. Aboriginal communities and nations must be given the time and resources they need to build the governance structures they want to represent them, to decide how and when they are ready and willing to participate. Even then, they deserve a space for their stories to continue to be heard. At every stage, the decisions must be made by First Nations people, so that when truth-telling occurs in its many forms, and Australia has to listen to the unspeakable, justice may be served. As the Yoo-rrook Justice Commission puts it, things cannot remain the same.

3/17/2022,"Rents have risen by more than $200 a week over the last two years in parts of Queensland, a surge which has forced people from their home towns and into caravans, sheds and poverty. Data compiled for the Guardian by CoreLogic reveals the immense pressure households have been under since the start of the pandemic – even before widespread flooding displaced thousands more people. Tenants on the Sunshine and Gold coasts have been hit hardest by soaring rents, with those areas accounting for all 11 postcodes to have experienced the highest percentage rise in average housing rents over the two years to January – and 17 of the top 20 postcodes. While rents have gone up across the state, Queenslanders in coastal and hinterland areas were slugged with the biggest rent rises as interstate migration boomed and white collar workers abandoned capital cities. This was true for the percentage and amount by which rents rose. Cooran in the Sunshine Coast hinterland saw rents rise by the highest percentage over the two-year period, with median weekly rents rising by 34%. That amounted to an extra $141 tenants forked out every week, from a total $415 to $556. Neighbouring Pomona experienced the third highest rise of 29.9%. It was the soaring cost of real estate which drove retirees Phillip and Robyn McManus from that quaint town, 25km inland from Noosa. The pensioners have lived in the Sunshine Coast hinterland for 30 years, the last seven of those in Pomona. They were forced to leave their home of six years when it was put on the market. Less than a year later, they went through the “financial and emotional hurt” of moving all over again when their next rental was sold from under them. Phillip McManus said he “couldn’t blame the landlords”. They were paying $350 a week in rent for the first house and $375 for the second while house prices soared. The average asking price for a Pomona house went from below $600,000 at the start of 2020 to more than $890,000 this March, according to data from SQM Research. Desperate, the couple were on the verge of moving “out to Nanango or north of Gympie”. But they were spared that move when they landed a rental through a friend in Eumundi, 15 minutes down the Bruce Highway. At $450 a week it is a squeeze on their budget, but Phillip McManus said it was “a blessing from the gods”. Because he knew others were not so fortunate. “All of a sudden we are seeing people that are desperate, people sleeping in parks, caravan parks are full,” he said. “It is bringing huge hardship to the area that we haven’t seen before.” In nearby Cootharaba, average rents rose $155 over the two years to $740. That’s well above what Jodi Wood and her husband pay in rent. But then, they live in what she describes as “half a shed”. Since they moved in three years ago, the couple’s rent has risen by $115 to a “crazy” $500. Wood said they could afford the rent hike. She works in the local supermarket, he has a good job as a highway traffic controller. But they will have to tighten their belts as they try to build a new home north of Gympie for themselves, her daughter and her daughter’s six children. Wood said her daughter had been living between caravan parks and staying with family for years as she was unable to afford a rental for her young family. “We are lucky, we can struggle by and we can make it,” she said. “It’s the kids you worry about. They’ve got no security.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning As the couple work hard to break out of the rental market, Wood said she felt let down by the housing system. “This is not just happening to people on the dole – it’s normal, everyday people getting hammered,” she said. “We worked through the floods, the fires and then Covid, and now we get punished.” Even as rents rise disproportionately in small towns, Wood said they were hardest hit by surging petrol prices. “With everything else going up, we go to work, we eat – and that’s it,” she said.

Rent rises were not felt exclusively on the Gold and Sunshine coasts, but the biggest rises were overwhelmingly experienced on or near the coast. The Gladstone area saw rents rise by 25.2% to an average of $406, while rents in the coastal town of Emu Park in central Queensland rose by $100 a week to $503. The postcode of 4217, which includes Surfers Paradise, saw rents rise by the largest amount, with the average rent going up by $208 to $1,056 a week. The postcodes of 4218, which includes Broadbeach, and 4567, which includes Noosa, each rose by $204 to $1,029 and $991 respectively.

3/17/2022,"The Morrison government is facing questions over why it has not included two Russian oligarchs, who have assets in Australia, among those it has imposed sanctions against over the invasion of Ukraine. Oleg Deripaska, who has a stake in an alumina refinery in Gladstone run by Rio Tinto, and Viktor Vekselberg, who has an interest in a gas project in the Beetaloo Basin, were not among 41 oligarchs and family members Australia’s department of foreign affairs and trade hit with sanctions on Monday. Deripaska and Vekselberg were among oligarchs sanctioned by the US in 2018 for reasons including Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, and last week the UK government included Deripaska among seven influential business figures sanctioned over the war against Ukraine. Director of climate and environment at activist investor group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, Dan Gocher, said Australia should impose sanctions on Deripaska and Vekselberg. “Their links to Putin are well-established and have been for years,” he said. “We can’t make sense of Dfat’s list, to be honest. “We would hope that Dfat adds them to the list and we would hope that Australian companies haven’t been lobbying to keep them off the list, that would be untoward.” National director of transparency advocacy group Publish What You Pay, Clancy Moore, said: “The involvement of Russian oligarchs in Australia’s resources sector raises serious red flags for communities, investors and government regulators. “Since the invasion, the foreign minister has announced sanctions on almost 500 oligarchs, economic entities and influential supporters of Putin’s regime. Why has the Australian government chosen to not introduce sanctions on Viktor Vekselberg and Oleg Deripaska when they are sanctioned by the US and UK respectively? “It’s in Australia’s national interest to have greater transparency for our natural resources sector. This includes a public beneficial ownership register so that communities know who ultimately owns and profits from mining, oil and gas projects.” An Origin Energy spokesperson said it would be “shocking and offensive” to suggest the company would seek to influence government sanctions. “We are appalled by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and will abide by rules set by the Australian government with respect to sanctions that might be put in place,” the spokesperson said. A Rio Tinto spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company had lobbied for or against any person being included on the sanctions list and Guardian Australia does not suggest that it has. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Billionaire mining magnate Andrew Forrest said anyone doing business with Russia was profiting from “blood money”. “So I certainly reach out to all my fellow business leaders and say, if you’re still making money in Russia, if you’re not getting out, if you are even considering not getting out quickly, then you must know … that you are taking the receipts of blood money, that Ukrainians are suffering at the hands of your business,” he told CNBC. The government has not ruled out further expanding sanctions. When asked to explain the failure to sanction Vekselberg and Deripaska to date, a spokesperson for Dfat said the government would “not speculate about future potential listings”. “Sanctions considerations are continuing,” the spokesperson said. “We have so far sanctioned more than 460 individuals, businesses and entities, including 41 oligarchs and their immediate family members.” Dfat’s position was first reported by ABC News. As Guardian Australia has previously reported, Vekselberg has an interest in an exploration project in the Beetaloo Basin, an area in the Northern Territory touted by the Morrison government as a key part of a gas-led recovery from the Covid crisis, through his shareholding in a London-listed company, Falcon Oil & Gas. Falcon is the junior partner in a joint venture to explore gas tenements with Australia’s Origin Energy. Vekselberg’s representative on the Falcon board, Maxim Mayorets, stepped down on 1 March. At the time, Origin said it had raised concerns about Vekselberg’s 16% stake in Falcon with the company. A company founded by Deripaska, EN+ Group, owns 20% of Queensland Alumina Limited, which operates a plant in Gladstone that refines bauxite into alumina, the remainder of which is owned by Rio Tinto. Deripaska formerly controlled EN+ but after he was sanctioned by the US in 2018 reduced his stake in it to 45% so that it was not captured by the measures against him. Rio Tinto and an EN+ subsidiary, Rusal, pay QAL to refine the bauxite in proportion to their ownership of the plant. Rusal also buys its share of the bauxite refined by QAL from Rio. In addition, the partners provide debt finance to QAL, also in proportion to their ownership, and in return receive interest payments from the refinery. In the event of sanctions taking in Rusal, Rio Tinto would take over operation of QAL.",News/Australia news,Putin-linked Russian oligarchs with Australian assets escape Morrison government sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/putin-linked-russian-oligarchs-with-australian-assets-escape-morrison-government-sanctions
3/17/2022,"That it was expected makes it no less shocking. The huge surge in housing loans early last year always meant property prices were going to take off. But it still takes your breath away when the latest residential property price data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that prices across the nation rose a record 24% last year. If the graph does not display, click here Prices grew fast in Sydney, of course. Sydney has been ground zero for the housing boom, but not the city with the fastest price growth. Last year property prices in Brisbane rose 28%, while in Canberra they went up 29% – both faster than the 27% growth in Sydney. But Hobart took the prize for the hottest property market. In 2021, property prices there rose 30%. As has been the case since the market took off in the second half of 2020 once the government HomeBuilder program began to take hold, the boom came in houses rather than apartments and flats in most capital cities. But so hot is the Hobart property market right now that the prices for houses and apartments have both risen more than 40% since June 2020: If the graph does not display, click here The good news (such as it is) is that prices have not risen by more than they did. Given the link between property prices and housing finance growth, the recent surge was completely expected – and yet it appears to have peaked at a level not too far above what occurred during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) stimulus period, despite home loans now growing by a great deal more: If the graph does not display, click here Because the growth of home loans has fallen in the past six months, that should mean that the crazy explosion of property prices across the country will moderate. But take note: we are just talking about a slowing of the growth. Property prices across the country are still expected to keep rising strongly. If the relationship between home loans and property prices holds, we should expect an annual rise in prices to slow from the current 24% to just below 15% by June this year – but that would still be among the fastest growth this century: If the graph does not display, click here So shocking is the property market right now that we don’t even need to talk about annual or quarterly growth to grasp just how insane things are. Consider Brisbane. Since 2012 and the end of the GFC, house prices there grew at a pretty steady rate of around 4% a year, give or take a percent. That is of course faster than wages grew during that time, but it is not at a level that you would think unsustainable. Had you been thinking about saving up for a house in Brisbane in June 2020, you could have thought that given the median price for a house was then $547,000 you could reasonably budget for such a house costing around $587,000 in 18 months’ time. And then the market exploded: If the graph does not display, click here $587,000? Yeah, nah. Try $765,000. Median house prices now bear little resemblance around the country to what they did a year and half ago. In Sydney the median house price is $1.3m and Canberra is now the second most expensive market, with its median price also breaking through $1m for the first time: If the graph does not display, click here Since the middle of 2020 residential prices have on average risen 28.4%, while at the same time wages have risen just 2.9%. Since 2012 average household disposable income has risen 30%, while property prices have risen 82%: If the graph does not display, click here This of course has absolutely destroyed any sense of housing being affordable for a median household. It’s always tricky to work out median household income, given the different types of households. But for a couple with one child, which is often when people are looking to move out of an apartment or buy their first home, the median household disposable income is roughly equivalent to the average male full-time earnings plus a third of average women total earnings. That would give such a household in Sydney a gross income of around $120,000. That means the median house price in Sydney is now 10.8 times that of the median household income, compared with just over six times in 2012: If the graph does not display, click here Affordability is not as bad elsewhere (because prices are nowhere near as high) but for all cities except Perth and Darwin, housing affordability is worse now than it ever has been. In most capital cites, housing affordability is around 25% worse than it was just 18 months ago. Given the truly stagnant wages growth and the extreme stimulus directed towards the housing market, that combination may not be surprising, but it remains truly shocking.",News/Business,Australian home prices rose a record 24% last year.

3/17/2022,"For most of us, when the fridge comes to mind, it’s usually because we are working out what snack we’d like to eat. Generally, it is not the centre of big issues like food safety, money or food waste. But perhaps it should be. “The most-wasted foods in Australia are vegetables, bread, fruit, bagged salad, milk and leftovers,” says Annika Stott, a sustainability strategist at OzHarvest. Meaning the household fridge has a significant role to play in fighting food waste – or in making it worse. “The majority of food waste comes from our homes,” says Stott, “over 2.5m tonnes each year. And sadly 70% of this is perfectly edible food.” Disorganised fridges have an impact on wastage for a variety of reasons, from incorrect storage, to overpacking to simply forgetting what you’ve already bought, she explains. Fridges can also be a hot spot for food poisoning, says Lydia Buchtmann, the communication director of the Food Safety Information Council. “There are an estimated 4.1m cases of food poisoning in Australia each year. Using your fridge correctly is a key way of reducing your risk.” An organised fridge is also good for the household budget, says Sarah Cottman, who chairs the Institute of Professional Organisers International, since you are less likely to accidentally double up or overpurchase. Fortunately, arranging a fridge to take care of the big things also makes it easier to grab that snack you were thinking about. Taming a fridge begins by figuring out its contents, says Stott. Knowing what food you have in stock means you can “buy only what you need” and “cook up what you’ve got before buying more”. If your fridge is particularly crowded, Cottman suggests taking everything out. “One by one, pick up each item and check the expiry. Items that are still good to be consumed can be wiped over and put next to the sink, ready to go back in,” she says. This is particularly important for food safety. “Any packaged food must be used or frozen by its use-by date,” says Buchtmann. It is also worth checking packaging for storage instructions, Cottman suggests. Some things that could be stored in the pantry may have made their way into the fridge, so evicting them will free up space. “The freezer is a great way to hit the pause button,” says Stott. “There’s not much that can’t be frozen – you just have to remember to cook and eat from the freezer.” This is even true of one of the most-wasted fridge items: milk. Stott says that milk near its use-by date can be put in the freezer until you need it. “To defrost, place it in the fridge and give [it] a little shake.” Putting the right items in the right place is important for food safety, says Buchtmann, since the temperature inside a fridge varies. “The fridge door is warmer than other areas of the fridge, so keep that for less-risky items like drinks and jams and pickles.” You also need to quarantine high risk items, since “cross contamination is a major source of food poisoning”. This means storing “raw meat and chicken where it cannot drip onto … foods that won’t be cooked, such as salads and desserts,” she says. Once safety concerns are addressed, Cottman suggests developing a storage system that makes intuitive sense for your household, like keeping specific cuisine ingredients together or keeping similar items together. “Perhaps a shelf for dairy, cheeses, cream and sour cream, yoghurt, dips etc.” Knowing where everything goes makes it faster to take stock of what you’ve got, and less likely that items will get lost and expire. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning “Our research showed that creating a use-it-up shelf is the best way to reduce food waste at home,” says Stott. Based on this insight, OzHarvest created Use It Up tape which works as a screamingly obvious visual cue on what to eat first. The tape is free for all Australian households, delivered for the price of postage. “Simply mark a ‘Use It Up’ shelf in your fridge, freezer or pantry, or stick it on containers or food that needs using up,” Stott says. “Once you see what you already have in the fridge, you’re more likely to use it up.” The optimal fridge temperature is at or below 5C, Buchtmann says. But depending on the temperature outside and what, or how much, you keep in the fridge, you may need to set the internal temperature lower to keep things consistently cool. For example, if you place leftovers that are still warm in the fridge without turning the temperature down, this can raise the overall temperature in the fridge, possibly resulting in the growth of harmful bacteria. If your fridge does not have an inbuilt thermometer – or you don’t trust what the thermometer is telling you – you can buy one separately. Moving a thermometer around the fridge will also show you the location of any hot or cold spots, so you can avoid accidentally freezing your cucumbers or spoiling your milk. “Fresh vegetables should be stored in the crisper to keep their quality,” says Buchtmann. But if your fridge has multiple fruit and vegetable crispers, it’s worth setting them at different humidity levels. Things that wilt, like leafy greens, are best kept at higher humidity, while most fruits keep better at low humidity. Stott and Cottman both advocate meal planning before you shop as a way to save money and cut down on waste. To avoid ingredients destined for dinner being inadvertently eaten, Cottman proposes a designated cooking shelf where you “keep … planned meal ingredients in a container or strong brown paper bag, and write the day of the week on the outside”. “This could also be the same shelf [used] for leftovers,” she says. When you bring a grocery shop home, make sure all purchases are stored to last. It is important not to wash fruit or vegetables until you are ready to eat them, as washing may encourage mould, says Buchtmann. Berries are best stored in their original container, advises Stott, as are sliced meats, which should also be sealed tightly to stay fresh. Finally, Buchtmann suggests using your laziest impulses to your advantage. “When you unpack your groceries, put the newer items at the back of the fridge, so the older food is used first and not wasted.”",Lifestyle/Food,‘See what you have and use it up’: seven steps to organising a functional fridge,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/17/see-what-you-have-and-use-it-up-seven-steps-to-organising-a-functional-fridge
3/17/2022,"The AFL has confirmed that influential sports neurologist Dr Paul McCrory has not been a member of the league’s Concussion Scientific Committee or any other of its committees or groups working on concussion since 2021. An AFL spokesperson said McCrory ceased to be involved with the league’s concussion committees or working groups in January 2021, and has not been involved in such a capacity with the league since. The spokesperson did not provide detail on why the affiliation around concussion ended, and McCrory has not responded to repeated requests for comment. But his work with the AFL on concussion ceased before recent allegations of plagiarism occurred. McCrory resigned as chair of the Concussion in Sport Group [CISG] on 5 March after being accused of plagiarising stories in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, with the journal removing one of his editorials from 2005 for alleged “unlawful and indefensible breach of copyright” of the work of Prof Steve Haake. McCrory has since been accused of further plagiarism, and reportedly apologised, telling website Retraction Watch that he had requested the papers in question be retracted and “The errors were not deliberate or intentional”. Separately, on Wednesday, Australia’s medical regulator, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency [Ahpra] told Guardian Australia that in May 2018 McCrory “provided an enforceable undertaking to the Medical Board of Australia that he will not perform neurodiagnostic procedures, nerve conduction studies, or electromyography until approved to so by the Board”.” An Ahpra spokesperson confirmed that undertaking is still in effect, remaining in force until it is removed from the public register. When asked for the reasons why the undertaking was given they said “privacy provisions in the National Law prevent us from commenting further”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ahpra said that, speaking generally, medical regulatory agencies “can accept an undertaking from a practitioner to limit the practitioner’s practice in some way if this is necessary to protect the public”. “When a National Board or adjudication body decides an undertaking is no longer required to ensure safe practice, they are revoked and are no longer published,” she said. “An undertaking is voluntarily entered into by a practitioner as opposed to a ‘condition’ which is imposed on a practitioner’s registration.” She added that “current undertakings which relate to a practitioner’s health are mentioned on the national register but details are not provided” Guardian Australia does not suggest that there is any issue with McCrory’s health or that his professional practice poses any risk to the public and has approached him for an explanation as to why he provided the enforced undertaking. McCrory is a former Collingwood club doctor, and has advised the AFL on its concussion policies. Dan Palmer, who is scrum coach for rugby union team the Brumbies and a former player, said that in his view McCrory should not be involved in the development of any concussion policies while his work is the subject of plagiarism allegations.Palmer is a PhD student in neuroscience at the Australian National University in Canberra and said while he is not a concussion researcher, “from my experience in contact sport it is clear that concussion can have considerable implications for people over varying timeframes”.“I am not familiar with the exact roles McCrory has played in developing concussion protocols, but given the situation, the protocols influenced by him or his research should be reviewed to be sure they align with the best quality and most up-to-date science,” Palmer said. Last week AFL chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, told the Herald Sun, amid the plagiarism allegations, that the league had not cut ties with him: “As far as I understand, he has a relationship with us as we do with many parties,” McLachlan was quoted as saying. “And I’ve had no discussions about any review of that.” “I think there is a discussion which I’m aware of around plagiarism of an article in 2005. That is for other people to sort out and I think it was an introduction rather than the research.” On Tuesday a spokesperson for the AFL said that McCrory had not been a member of the AFL’s Concussion Scientific Committee nor any other committee or working group working on concussion in the AFL since January 2021. He did not respond to questions about whether McCrory is still involved with the league in any other capacity. Concussion in AFL has been a controversial topic, with increasing calls for the league to acknowledge cognitive issues experienced by players and former players, allegedly as a result of head injuries that occurred during their playing careers. The AFL told Guardian Australia player safety is a priority. “Prioritising the health and safety of our players at all levels of Australian Football is paramount and the AFL will continue to take appropriate steps to improve safety whilst maintaining the fabric of our great game,” the statement said. The statement said the AFL’s concussion management protocols draw on a variety of sources beyond the international consensus statements on concussion in sport “as was evident from the AFL’s adoption in 2021 of a minimum 12-day rest and rehabilitation period post-concussion”. Last year, the AFL announced the appointment of a “head of concussion and healthcare governance” and a “head of concussion innovation and research” to coordinate the game’s response to sports-related concussion. “The AFL Commission also approved funding for a longitudinal research project to track players from the talent pathways through to post career,” the statement said.",Sport/Sport,AFL says they no longer work with concussion expert Dr Paul McCrory ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/afl-says-they-no-longer-work-with-concussion-expert-dr-paul-mccrory
3/17/2022,"Australia’s booster rollout is lagging behind other countries as the vaccination program continues to suffer the ripple effects of the slow initial rollout. Millions of eligible Australians are yet to get their third Covid-19 vaccine dose, and the daily vaccination numbers are dropping. Australia is ranked seventh in the OECD for second doses administered, but just 22nd when it comes to boosters. Many countries have been plagued with slow and slowing booster rollouts, but Australia’s booster program began later than most OECD countries. Compounded by restricted eligibility, the booster rate in Australia is slower than many countries that have higher vaccination rates. Experts say that declining Covid case numbers and perceptions that Omicron is not as severe may be contributing to the low takeup. Recent high case numbers may also be contributing to the sluggish rate, as some delay their next shot until after they have fully recovered from infections. Dr Jane Frawley from the University of Technology Sydney suggests targeted messaging campaigns may be needed to encourage more Australians to get a booster. Frawley and her colleagues recently launched decision aids to help adults and parents work through their choices about getting vaccinated. Guardian Australia’s booster tracker shows that the same number of people have received booster shots as had received second doses over five months ago. The gap has only been increasing in recent weeks despite eligibility being reduced to three months for anyone aged over 16 years. Over 19m second doses had been administered three months ago. With just over 12.2m boosters administered, there are about 7 million Australians eligible for boosters that have not had them. More than half of all the second doses administered in 2021 were in the last four months. So a huge percentage of the population – especially younger Australians – only started becoming eligible for boosters this year. The daily booster rate appears to have been responsive to increasing availability. There was a huge increase in boosters administered when eligibility was expanded in early December to anyone 18 or over who had had a second dose at least five months previously. The rate dipped towards the end of December, especially once five-to-11-year-olds became eligible for their first doses and parents began competing for vaccination slots. The rate increased again as eligibility expanded to four months and the Omicron wave started, but it has since fallen away despite repeated eligibility expansions. Guardian Australia previously found that the lowest level of booster uptake was in younger Australians, which has been confirmed by recent data from the department of health. “That age group had a lot of cases within it, the younger 18-24 age group. That’s one reason you’re seeing a lower uptake in boosters” says Frawley. As case numbers have dropped from highs in early January, politicians have stopped appearing daily on television and searches for Covid boosters have dropped away. Frawley says that this lack of salience may also be contributing to the lower booster takeup. “If it’s not being reported in your space regularly, every day, you’re not seeing it. It’s not a topic of conversation. You’re not talking about how many have lost their lives. It’s not front and centre. We are not getting those messages out effectively any more. “When the booster was first offered we were much better at messaging the importance of the booster and why you should get one. “Perhaps what we need is targeting messaging. If we are worried about the 18, 19, 20-year-olds then maybe we need targeted messaging to tell them why they should bother. To tell them why they should make an appointment.” Data from around the world confirms that Australia isn’t alone in having a slow booster rollout. In the United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand and South Korea the daily booster numbers peaked in late December or early January. Frawley says “we are pretty much on par” with booster uptake around the world. “This is phenomena we have seen everywhere. So primary doses weren’t too bad, especially in older age groups. But boosters have been slow everywhere.” “The message still needs to be to have a booster”. “[You are] less likely to get it. Less likely to get it severely. Less likely to pass it on. Less likely to get really sick. Less likely to have long-term consequences like long Covid. And to add to that, we don’t know what’s around the corner. We don’t know if we are going to see something that is a little bit nastier.”",News/Australia news,Tracking Australia’s booster rollout: data shows millions of eligible Australians yet to get third Covid vaccine dose,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-datablog/2022/mar/17/tracking-australias-booster-rollout-data-shows-millions-of-eligible-australians-yet-to-get-third-covid-vaccine-dose
3/17/2022,"Francesca Young began renting on Victoria’s Mornington peninsula as a single mother of three in the early 2000s when properties were “pretty easy to find and reasonably priced”. But after the 51-year-old’s second marriage ended and she emerged from hospital following a health scare in 2019, she was shocked at the region’s rental prices when she re-entered the market. “The difference was unbelievable,” she said. That was before Covid turbocharged everything again, with lockdowns and work from home leading many Victorians to seize the opportunity to move to the coast. The Mornington peninsula experienced some of the biggest jumps in rent nationwide over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, with some postcodes recording increases of more than a third in two years, according to data provided to the Guardian by CoreLogic. In fact, seven of the top eight Victorian postcodes for rental jumps between January 2020 and 2022 were on the peninsula. In that time, rents in Blairgowrie grew by 35.4% while Rye and St Andrews Beach increased by 34.9%. The average rent increase for the 289 Victorian postcodes for which CoreLogic had sufficient rental information was 9.1% for houses. This was the lowest of any state or territory. Victorian unit rents were relatively flat, with an average increase of just 2.34%. A total of 86 postcodes – all in Melbourne – experienced falls in rent over the past two years. But on the Mornington peninsula, seven postcodes recorded growth of 20% or more. Young, who works full-time in administration, rents a three-bedroom house in Rye she shares with another tenant. When her 10-year-old daughter stays with her, they share a single bedroom. But the property – normally an Airbnb – is only a six-month lease until August. “I’m still looking every day and I’m terrified because I might have to spend up to $500 a week on a single income and that’s without food, bills, running a car and school expenses,” she told Guardian Australia. “Being a single person, there is nothing half-decent for under $450. That’s nearly half my salary.” The region’s rental crunch means Young is also competing against potential tenants able to pay 12 months of rent rent up-front to secure a property. “It feels like I’m up against a brick wall because I don’t have the means to do that and it seems incredibly unfair,” Young said. Jennifer Beveridge, chief executive of Tenants Victoria, said it was alarming that tenants had to offer up to a year’s worth of rent in advance to secure properties. “It highlights the demand and that property managers feel it’s OK to ask for that, so what we’re seeing is a real divide between those who can afford to do that and those who can’t,” she said. “The people who can’t are people who need to stay close to their places of work like retail, healthcare, hospitality. It’s particularly concerning in regional areas where people need to move to another town to find something affordable and that adds huge amounts of travel time.” Single mother of two Emma Grosse moved back to the Mornington peninsula – where she grew up – from Melbourne in May 2021 to raise her children closer to her family. The 23-year-old receives single parent welfare payments as her sole income. The only way she could secure her current house – a three-bedroom house for $450 a week – for herself and her two children, aged one and three, was to offer 12 months’ rent up-front with the support of her grandparents. “I feel really disheartened for the people that are in a position where they’re not able to offer that or they don’t have that support from family members or friends,” she said. “It’s really heartbreaking to see that the cost of real estate has really torn apart so many families and so many communities.” CoreLogic’s research director, Tim Lawless, said the rental crunch was likely to remain an ongoing challenge for the Mornington peninsula despite the slowing of the early pandemic’s seachange trend. “We’ve seen overall across the Mornington peninsula in just the last 12 months, rents are up about 11.2%. What that means is with incomes rising at 2.5%, it’s becoming harder and harder for a lot of people to afford the rents in a market that’s so hotly contested,” he said. “While I still think demand will remain quite strong along the peninsula, it may be the case that we do see some demand rippling a little further out towards the Bass Coast or towards Frankston.” CoreLogic only considered postcodes with a minimum of 20 rental observations.",News/Australia news,‘I’m terrified’: residents of Victoria’s Mornington peninsula hit hard by pandemic rent rises,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/im-terrified-residents-of-victorias-mornington-peninsula-hit-hard-by-pandemic-rent-rises
3/17/2022,"The Morrison government has sat on a report addressing the vulnerability of Australia’s fuel supplies for two years, with concern mounting that its findings could stay secret for 20 years if they are not released before the election and the Coalition loses. The Liquid Fuel Security Review’s final report was presented to the government at the end of 2019. An interim report in April of that year found Australia had just 18 days’ worth of petrol and 22 for diesel in storage – well short of an agreement with the International Energy Agency to hold the equivalent of 90 days of imports. Australians have been reminded of the risk of supply interruptions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The war and subsequent sanctions against Russia have sent local fuel prices soaring by at least a quarter to well beyond $2 a litre in much of Australia. Russia supplies just 1.5% of Australia’s oil imports but an immediate import ban could have caused “potential fuel shortages”, said Viva Energy, one of the country’s two remaining oil refiners that was waiting for two shipments to land. The government gave Viva and Ampol, the other refiner, 45 days’ grace before the ban kicked in. Similarly, the shortage of a diesel additive late last year after China banned urea exports threatened to cripple the trucking industry. South Australian senator Rex Patrick, whose freedom of information request to make the final fuel security report public was rejected in 2020, believes the government “never intended to release it”. Instead, “there’s been a hodgepodge of incoherent measures that have gone nowhere near our national security obligation and our international agreement”, Patrick said. “The government claims this document is cabinet-in-confidence,” he said. “In two months’ time, if the Albanese government were to win government, that document will be buried for 20 years, and a Labor government would have to start over.” The final security report would probably have revealed how long supplies for “critical users” might last amid what the interim paper dubbed “new and emerging threats”. Modelling of “an extreme and unlikely scenario” in which Australia was cut off from oil and fuel imports showed local refining capacity “could support critical users for around three months”, the interim report found. However, since then the number of oil refiners in Australia has reduced from four to two. A spokesperson for the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said there had “been significant changes to the fuel market both domestically and internationally since the interim liquid fuel security review was compiled”, ranging from Covid-induced demand drops through to the “current supply pressures” resulting from Russia’s war. “The Morrison government is taking strong, proactive measures to further enhance our domestic fuel security,” the spokesperson said. These included subsidising the two refineries until at least mid-2027, introducing a minimum stockholding obligation to safeguard levels of key transport fuels, and increasing onshore diesel stocks by 40% with industry through a $260m grants program. The government has also bought about 1.7m barrels of oil and stored it in the US’s strategic petroleum reserve. However, Richie Merzian, director of the Australia Institute’s climate & energy program, said storing fuel offshore meant depending on ships to bring it to Australia. “In an emergency, you have to rely on the goodwill of those [foreign-flagged] carriers to honour the shipments,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Up until the review, the government had little knowledge about the availability of supplies, relying on the private sector to tell them, said Merzian, who is preparing a report on fuel security. “The federal government’s been sitting on a liquid fuel security strategy, it’s been sitting on [tightening] CO2 emission standards for cars,” he said. “As a result, we lack choice, and we lack any effort to actually reduce our reliance on foreign oil.” Chris Bowen, Labor’s energy spokesperson, said the government should have released and acted on the report years ago, not least because the Senate highlighted the problem in 2015. “The average Australian household spends the same amount of money on fuel as they do on electricity and gas combined,” Bowen said. “So it’s critical we have secure supply [and try to prevent] the current crippling price shocks hurting families and businesses.” The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said “the government’s pro-fossil fuel agenda” had compromised Australia’s energy security. “Instead of making us energy independent by shifting to sun- and wind-powered electric vehicles, they’ve doubled down on last-century technology and left us exposed to dictators and global conflict,” he said.",News/Australia news,Morrison government yet to release 2019 report on vulnerability of Australia’s fuel supplies,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/morrison-government-yet-to-release-2019-report-on-vulnerability-of-australias-fuel-supplies
3/17/2022,"Two weeks after catastrophic flooding devastated Lismore, hundreds of photographs and postcards line the floor of Simon Robinson’s destroyed home on Union Street in the town’s south. They are the only personal possessions he has left. Many of them are stuck in pairs, soaked together by the flood waters and mud they were submerged in for days. The 64-year-old antiques dealer is patiently waiting for them to dry, so he can attempt to brush off the remaining dirt and salvage what he can. Having shunned computers and scanning digital backups, the roughly 40 family pictures and scores of postcards from disjointed collections are some of Robinson’s few remaining keepsakes. Now, in the aftermath of the floods in the New South Wales norther rivers region, Robinson is using a smartphone for the first time, after his previous phone was ruined when he dropped it in water trying to break through a fibro gable above his living room. Initially, Robinson considered himself lucky when, after believing he was destined to drown as waters rose beyond his ceiling, he was rescued almost 18 hours later from the roof of his late 19th century house. However, a fortnight on, he is dealing with a new loss. As he sifts through the remains of his life, it is not the roughly $500,000 of antiques lost from his home and his shop in Lismore that are of most concern. It’s the realisation he now has no photographs of his late father. “I had the album of Dad’s 21st birthday in there, and I haven’t even seen that wash up, it’s just gone,” Robinson said. Robinson has been collecting antiques for 50 years. The floods ruined historic photos, books and newspaper clippings of noteworthy events from as far back as the 1910s, as well as architectural, military and art pieces of global significance. Among his collection was a rare album of photos taken shortly after Sir Charles Kingsford Smith crashed one of his planes near Old Bonalbo – a small town about 70km west of Lismore – in 1930. Few photos of the event are known to exist, and Robinson said his album was washed away in the floods. “The Lismore-related things, I had always planned to donate them to the local museum. There were also hats and parasols from the Victorian era, it’s stuff you can’t replace,” he said. Robinson, like thousands of other residents of Lismore and the northern rivers, is only now comprehending the enormity of the flood’s long-term damage on the region’s history. The loss to the area’s art and cultural assets has also been profound. The Lismore regional gallery has reportedly suffered “sickening” damage, according to its director, Ashleigh Ralph. The NSW government quickly organised a convoy of freezer trucks – essential to stop mould forming – to move damaged pieces to Brisbane to attempt a mass salvage operation. But not all collections were able to access this assistance. Mountains of books have formed outside Lismore library, destined to be incorporated into the year’s worth of landfill created by the floods. Millions of dollars of collectibles owned by local antique stores have also been thrown into garbage piles as owners assess the damage. However, archivists and historians are now asking flood-affected residents and business owners to reconsider what they believe is unsalvageable to “prevent communities losing their heritage and their cultural identity”. Jennifer Gall, a curator from the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, grew up in Lismore, and is concerned at what the loss of historical artefacts and family memories will mean for the region. “It’s a well-documented fact that in the initial cleanout, people throw out everything without sorting – the enormity of the damage is too momentous to cope with. Then people wake up in a month’s time and realise that they threw out their entire family history, or their valuable historic shop stock and regret this,” Gall said. “This loss of identity and personal treasures is doubly devastating after losing a house and other important possessions.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Gall is urging flood-affected residents and businesses to consult professional advice about how to salvage flood-damaged items. This includes freezing individual items in bags as soon as possible to prevent moulding. “Please pause and think before you throw out photos, films, documents, wedding dresses, musical instruments and so on,” she said. She is also concerned about the loss of town records. “These are the memory of working class people, who have lived as farmers, and there are huge Indigenous collections too. These are the records of the common person. “Most of us are not mentioned in history books, but our lives make up the fabric of society. When these records are damaged, we’re in danger of being left with just published books about those with money and education.” One of the most significant repositories of this local history is the Lismore museum. Robert Smith, the president of the Richmond River Historical Society that runs the museum, said a plan to store its holdings on the top level of the building had largely spared the collection from damage. However, cabinets containing original maps and plans for Lismore, and several boxes of archival film that were in the process of being digitised were water damaged. Smith said he was thankful that these items were also collected by the government-organised freezer trucks and was hopeful they could be salvaged. However, Smith, who is also a professor at the local Southern Cross University and a longtime researcher on the culture and history of the north coast of NSW, acknowledges just how important the loss of individual and family possessions will be for the region.

Those stories help one make sense of one’s place in their family and in this region,” Smith said. Back at Robinson’s store in Lismore, he thinks he will be able to salvage some plaster religious statues. However, looking around the floors of his house and surveying the damaged photographs, he is overwhelmed. “It’s hard to think straight at the moment,” Robinson said.",News/Australia news,‘It’s stuff you can’t replace’: experts fear priceless local history will be thrown out in NSW floods cleanup,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/its-stuff-you-cant-replace-experts-fear-priceless-local-history-will-be-thrown-out-in-nsw-floods-cleanup
