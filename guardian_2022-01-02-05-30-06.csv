1/2/2022,"Doctor Who has a history of casting comic actors against type in straight roles – think Frank Skinner, Catherine Tate, even Nicholas Parsons back in the day – but in Eve of the Daleks, you couldn’t help but feel as if guest stars Aisling Bea and Adjani Salmon had been cast to play Sarah and Nick as exaggerated versions of themselves. Indeed, at times (while trying to assemble the means to escape from the junk lying around ELF storage) Bea must have felt as if she was back on Taskmaster. Dan (John Bishop) himself described the situation as Groundhog Day. But given there was only an hour of TV for Chris Chibnall to play with, the device of having the time loop shorten each time around, and the characters having completely free rein in each loop until they died, the end result was rather more Russian Doll than Bill Murray classic.  Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor, in the first of the three 2022 specials that will see her bow out from the role, continued the more commanding form that we saw during the recent Flux series, fulls of plans and direction. She also had to deal with the Daleks finally learning to combat the sonic screwdriver. As an episode it was fine enough, but it was neither the creepy, claustrophobic, being stalked by Daleks extravaganza it could have been, nor a full-on comedy. It fell unsatisfactorily somewhere in the middle, despite the immense chaotic energy Bea brought to proceedings. In the end, I suppose the message that a “good-hearted weirdo” can still get the girl at the end of a Dalek-infused romcom of death is as appropriate a start to 2022 as we are likely to get. The Tardis team and friends face an escape room challenge to get away from Daleks who keep exterminating them in an ever-decreasing time loop. Yaz (Mandip Gill) has fallen in love with the Doctor! We haven’t just been imagining it. Whether the Doctor is going to reciprocate was left up in the air after Dan’s “My mate fancies you” act. It seems as if he has been scarred by Di’s standoffishness at the end of Flux, and doesn’t want anyone else to miss out on love. There was also some lovely interplay between Yaz and Dan, reflecting that they spent several years stranded together in the early 20th century without the Doctor during Flux. The continuing references to rivalries between Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield might be baffling to the international audience, but when Yaz said there was to be no dissing of her mate, because that was her job, you could feel an evolved relationship. There was some social media grumbling before the show – not the Daleks again! It is the third time Whittaker has faced them in a new year special, but then again, it is Doctor Who. It is always going to have Daleks, whose menacing sink-plunger first appeared on 21 December 1963. The Daleks weren’t especially menacing here, though – certainly nothing like the creepiness we have seen in other recent new year specials – although they did get to exterminate the Doctor more times in one hour than they’ve managed in the previous 58 years. Doctor Who festive specials tend to either be continuity-free one-offs, or extremely continuity-heavy leading up to a regeneration. Despite Whittaker’s impending departure, Chibnall opted for the former. We only got brief mentions of the Flux being the reason the Tardis needed a reset, and the events of Flux were the motivation for the Dalek’s animosity to the Doctor this time around. The main mystery, to be honest, was what Sarah actually saw in Nick by the end. Was that the longest cold open in the show’s history? Sleep No More and The Woman Who Fell to Earth both skipped the opening credits entirely, but I made it 9min and 17 sec before Segun Akinola’s theme-tune arrangement crashed in. It was Nancy Wilson’s 1963 recording of What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve? that opened the programme – coming from the same year Doctor Who first aired. At one point the Dalek said “I am not Nick”. It very much was. Nicholas Briggs has been providing the Dalek voices since 2005. Doctor Who was the seventh most streamed show on iPlayer in the UK in 2021, behind Line of Duty, the Olympics, Pretty Little Liars, Euro2020, Silent Witness and Waterloo Road, which hasn’t been on since March 2015. The BBC say Doctor Who was streamed 41.8m times. That figure isn’t just for the current series – every episode since 2005 is currently available – but it does suggest the important place the BBC still sees Doctor Who having in its drama lineup. The Sea Devils are back! Looking hilariously true to their original 1970s appearance! We are also going to meet 19th-century Chinese pirate Ching Shih. That airs in spring, and then we will get the end of the Whittaker era in autumn. After that, judging by what he said to the Guardian last week, we’ll have a whole year to wait until Russell T Davies’s second run at the show starts in November 2023. Have a great new year, and I’ll see you here again for Legend of the Sea Devils.

1/2/2022,"Ascruffy draw at Newcastle was not the beginning of the end of the Ralf Rangnick era and neither was a disjointed win over Burnley its glorious rebirth. Games against sides in the bottom quarter of the Premier League are not really how Manchester United should be judging themselves – not unless they’re losing them 4-1, in which case it really probably is time for a change. Optimists, though, perhaps could see signs of progress on Thursday: in Scott McTominay’s energy and drive, in Edinson Cavani’s continued sharpness, in the way Jadon Sancho swooped in from the flank for the second goal and the way Cristiano Ronaldo didn’t wave his arms about quite so frustratedly.  Body language, slightly oddly, dominated the post-match discussions. There is evidence from sports psychologists that it does make a difference – but then, it’s a lot easier to look happy and motivated when you’re winning; the real test will come next time United are being outplayed by Newcastle or struggling to break down Norwich. Monday’s game against Wolves, whose last seven games have featured just four goals at either end, may offer a more significant insight. Under Rangnick, United have taken 13 points from five Premier League games and lie sixth, five points off fourth with a game in hand. To that extent their season has been rekindled. But, other than Arsenal, whose away form against top sides is atrocious, they have not played a top-four challenger and, apart from a faltering West Ham, won’t do so until the beginning of March. At the moment, it feels as though United are in limbo, waiting for the real challenges ahead. But then limbo does seem to be club policy at the moment. It felt telling that the Newcastle performance prompted such discontent – both from that body language and in subsequent grumbling; much of it must stem from the sense of uncertainty. Not for the first time, the United board has come up with a solution that leaves nobody clear what the plan is – and these are directors, we know, with a tendency to react to events. Lacking football expertise of their own, they drift where public opinion takes them; Rio Ferdinand banging his hand on a desk in the BT Sport studio can change the entire history of Manchester United. Appointing Ole Gunnar Solskjær as an interim manager to detoxify the club after the dismissal of José Mourinho made sense. Giving him the job on a permanent basis three months later did not, however good initial results had been. Waiting till the end of the season would have given the club two months more evidence on which to base a decision and would have cost nothing; it’s not as though Solskjær was going to dash off and accept an offer from somebody else. United ended up winning only two of the 10 games that remained that season, a run that probably would have led to a different appointment and perhaps spared United the two wasted years that followed. Solskjær as temporary manager made sense; he was a popular club legend and it gave the board time to come up with a strategy. Rangnick as interim may make sense, but only if he is allowed to use this second half of the season to get a feel for the club, to assess the squad and to work out how he can shape it. But is that what his consultancy role means? Nobody seems to know. If it is Rangnick making decisions on recruitment, nominating a coach to pursue a vision he largely dictates, then this period of research could be extremely useful. But if that is the case, what is the role of the director of football, John Murtough, and the technical director, Darren Fletcher, both of whom were appointed in March? Rangnick is not Solskjær. He is not a living embodiment of the club’s most glorious period, not somebody to pay obeisance to Sir Alex Ferguson and remind players of the best traditions of the club. He is a technocratic outsider with his own clear vision of how the game should be played. Before arriving at United, he had coached only 88 first-team games in the previous decade, preferring to take on a supervisory role in the background – something at which he was hugely successful at RB Leipzig. He was open about disliking the pressure of frontline management at Schalke – and, big club though they are, the scrutiny there is nothing compared with that at United. His football demands intense physical and mental effort. If players think he will be gone in six months, reduced to a distant figure making the occasional phone call to Richard Arnold, Ed Woodward’s nominated successor as CEO, he is probably quite annoying. Then again, if this the way the new United are going to be, finding out which players find the Rangnick method annoying is a useful process. But there is also an issue of expectation. What is United’s aim for the rest of the season? If this is a fact-finding period before the grand reconstruction begins, then it’s unreasonable to place too much store by results; fourth place may be an aspiration but it cannot be a target. But equally it is understandable if, after eight years of drift, there is impatience among fans, who must look across Manchester and see in City, a club they had patronised for decades, a club that are better resourced, better run and better coached. It could be that Rangnick is the beginning of the process that will narrow that gap. But nobody should be under any illusions of how much work needs to be done. Solskjær’s management was a symptom of the club’s poor decision-making and, because of his status, a mask for it; it was not the cause of the problems. But the danger is that a lack of clarity stymies the revolution from the start, that, against better sides than Burnley, the frustration that was so evident at St James’ Park spills over into a more general indiscipline and that undermines the Rangnick project almost before it has begun. The uncertainty of Solskjær’s caretaker period was useful; the Rangnick uncertainty – interim coach then ill-defined consultancy – risks being self-defeating.",Sport/Football,Manchester United will remain in limbo while uncertainty lingers over Rangnick | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/01/manchester-united-will-remain-in-limbo-while-uncertainty-lingers-over-rangnick
1/2/2022,"This was the kind of ruthless performance that has defined David Moyes’s second spell at West Ham. In front of a raucous New Year’s Day home crowd and against opponents who clearly fancied their chances of bloodying the noses of their London rivals, two brilliant first-half goals from Michail Antonio and Manuel Lanzini – and Luka Milivojevic’s helping hand – ensured that their Champions League dream remains alive and well despite a late Crystal Palace fightback. Had Jean-Phillipe Mateta’s last-gasp volley sailed the other side of the post then it would have been a different story but with more than half the season completed, West Ham find themselves within a point of Arsenal and one ahead of Spurs, albeit having played two games more than Antonio Conte’s side. Anyone who had already written them off after their mini-blip last month may have to think again.  Vieira had been given a warm welcome from the home supporters as he returned from his Covid-enforced two-match absence. Yet despite Wilfried Zaha being free from suspension after his red card against Tottenham on Boxing Day, the hosts had to do without him and Cheikhou Kouyaté, who were both isolating ahead of their scheduled departure for the Africa Cup of Nations. That meant a return for Luka Milivojevic in midfield, while West Ham welcomed back Declan Rice from suspension. Mark Noble was the player to give way from the 4-1 win over Watford, allowing his replacement to surpass his record as the youngest player to reach 150 Premier League appearances for the club . Despite West Ham’s stuttering form before Christmas, their hopes of finishing in the top four remain intact as long as Rice is in the side but Moyes will also know finding defensive reinforcements in the January market could prove vital. They should really have found themselves behind inside the first two minutes when Jordan Ayew’s cutback from a deflected cross picked out Jeffrey Schlupp but the Ghanian somehow managed to hit the post from close range when it seemed much easier to score. When Ben Johnson was called on to block another effort from Schlupp, it seemed only a matter of time before Palace found the breakthrough. But having weathered the initial storm, West Ham went 2-0 up midway through the first half after some smart finishing from Antonio and Lanzini. There was nothing Vicente Guaita could do about either, with West Ham’s top scorer only having to touch Saïd Benrahma’s wicked inswinging cross to divert it in. Lanzini’s addition three minutes later after a typically surging run from Rice was a brilliant strike that flew past the Palace goalkeeper. To their credit, Palace kept coming forward and should have pulled one back when Odsonne Édouard let fly from after being set up by Ayew, only for his shot to cannon back off the crossbar and away to safety. Christian Benteke did at least manage to hit the target twice in quick succession before half-time but found Lukasz Fabianski in top form. Yet it was a moment of utter madness in first-half injury-time from Milivojevic that ended any chance of a Palace comeback. The Serbian midfielder probably thought he was being clever when he clearly handled the ball on the blind side of the referee, Darren England, and seemed to have got away with it initially. Unfortunately for him, VAR had spotted that the infringement had taken place just inside the box and it was left to Lanzini to stroke home the third from the spot. Vieira was clearly not happy with the decision and left the pitch at half-time remonstrating with a bemused England. Milivojevic could certainly count himself lucky not to be substituted after such an error, with the only change at the break seeing Arthur Masuaku replacing Johnson in West Ham’s defence. An early sighter from Benrahma at the start of the second half could have given Palace even more of a mountain to climb. Ayew - who will now meet up with Ghana’s Afcon squad - was the one constant threat for Palace down the right flank and it was his ball across the area that could have given them a lifeline had Édouard been able to direct his shot on target. Milivojevic’s miserable evening came to an end when he was replaced by Mateta with more than half an hour to play, while Antonio went close to doubling his tally with a shot from just outside the box. Michael Olise, another Palace substitute, was the architect of Palace’s fightback when his excellent cross was tapped home by Édouard at the far post before he curled home a free kick to set up a tense finale. But it came just too late to throw Moyes and his team off course.",Sport/Football,Manuel Lanzini doubles up as West Ham survive late scare at Crystal Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/crystal-palace-west-ham-premier-league-match-report
1/2/2022,"Ministers are keen to ease immigration restrictions in a bid to make it easier for thousands of Indian citizens to live and work in the UK as part of forthcoming trade talks. The potential offer will be under discussion when the international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, travels to Delhi this month, reports the Times. Relaxing immigration rules for Indian citizens is a key demand from Delhi.  Trevelyan is said to have the backing of the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who is keen to curb China’s growing influence in the region. However, they are likely to meet strong resistance from the home secretary, Priti Patel, who opposes the offer. According to the publication, visa relaxation options under consideration include a scheme similar to one agreed with Australia which would allow young Indians the right to live and work in the UK for up to three years. Another would be to cut visa fees for students and allow them to stay in Britain for a period of time after they graduate. Visa fees for work and tourism – which can cost up to £1,400 – could also be reduced as a sweetener. India has a GDP of about £2tn but it is a protectionist economy imposing significant tariffs on imports. Ministers believe a trade deal with Delhi would provide British businesses with a head start in what is predicted to be the world’s third-largest economy by 2050. It could also see Britain jump ahead as India does not have bilateral trade deals with either the US or the European Union. Ministers are said to be in agreement that a “generous” offer on visas could be the price for such a deal. One government figure told the Times: “The tech and digital space in India is still hugely protectionist and if we could open up even a slither of access it would put us ahead of the game.” On Friday Boris Johnson said he would “deliver on the promise of Brexit” and create new trade agreements. A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: “India is projected to become the world’s third-largest economy by 2050 and a free trade agreement will open up huge opportunities for UK businesses to trade with India’s £2.25tn economy. “Companies up and down the country can look forward to the benefits, from manufacturers in the West Midlands to tech experts in Belfast, and we look forward to launching negotiations early next year.”",News/Politics,UK ministers eager to ease immigration rules for Indian citizens,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/01/uk-ministers-eager-to-ease-immigration-rules-for-indian-citizens
