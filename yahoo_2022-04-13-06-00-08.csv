4/13/2022,"(Reuters) -Ukraine's security services on Tuesday said they had arrested pro-Russian politician Viktor Medvedchuk, who is President Vladimir Putin's closest and most influential ally in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had earlier published a photo of a tired-looking and handcuffed Medvedchuk, who says Putin is godfather to his daughter. In February, Kyiv said Medvedchuk, the leader of the Opposition Platform - For Life party, had escaped from house arrest. Last year authorities opened a treason case against Medvedchuk, who denies wrongdoing. ""You can be a pro-Russian politician and work for the aggressor state for years. You may have been hiding from justice lately. You can even wear a Ukrainian military uniform for camouflage,"" the security services said in an online post. ""But will it help you escape punishment? Not at all! Shackles are waiting for you and same goes for traitors to Ukraine like you."" The post cited Ivan Bakanov, head of the secret services, as saying his operatives had ""conducted a lightning-fast and dangerous multi-level special operation"" to arrest Medvedchuk but did not give details. Last month Zelenskiy said the Opposition Platform - For Life, which is Ukraine's largest opposition movement, and several other smaller political parties with ties to Russia had been suspended. A spokesperson for Medvedchuk was not immediately available for comment.

Bill Gates said ""it's somewhat ironic"" that anti-vaccine protesters falsely accuse him of malice through his work on vaccine development when his organization has helped save millions of lives. Gates addressed conspiracy theories and anti-vaccine activists on Tuesday at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Canada, where he gave a talk on how to prevent against the next pandemic. Anti-vaccine activists have spread misinformation on social media that have been shared worldwide, contributing to vaccine hesitancy in some communities, which experts say has prolonged the COVID-19 pandemic. Asked how he felt about the protests, Gates said it was ""kind of weird."" ""The Gates Foundation is very involved in vaccines, the invention of new vaccines, funding vaccines, and we're very proud that, through joint efforts like Gavi, that saved tens of millions of lives,"" Gates said, referring to a global alliance getting vaccines to every continent in the world. ""So it's somewhat ironic to have somebody turn around and say we're using vaccines to kill people or to make money or we started the pandemic."" Gates added: ""Does this turn into something where there's constantly crazy people showing up? Who knows.""

4/13/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A planned visit to Kyiv by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier was not welcomed by Ukraine, he said on Tuesday, following a report that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was critical of Steinmeier's historic advocacy of Western rapprochement with Russia. Steinmeier had planned to visit Kyiv with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda and the presidents of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia ""to send a strong signal of European solidarity with Ukraine there,"" he told journalists during a visit to Warsaw. ""I was ready for that. But apparently - and I have to admit - that was not wanted in Kyiv,"" he said, without elaborating. It was not immediately clear whether the other European leaders would visit without Steinmeier. Ukrainian authorities could not immediately be reached for comment. Bild newspaper reported earlier on Tuesday that Zelenskiy had rejected Steinmeier's plans to visit due to his close relations with Russia in recent years and his years of support for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, a project designed to double the flow of Russian gas direct to Germany but which has since been cancelled. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a social media backlash tweeting past pictures of Steinmeier affectionately embracing Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the president expressed regret for his earlier stance. He said his years of support for Nord Stream 2 had been clearly a mistake. Asked for comment on Steinmeier's remarks, a German government spokesperson said, ""Germany was and is one of the most determined supporters of Ukraine. ... And it will stay that way. ""The federal president takes a clear and unequivocal position on the side of Ukraine,"" the spokesperson added. Steinmeier, a Social Democrat who served as foreign minister under Chancellor Angela Merkel before being elevated to the presidency, had known Russian President Vladimir Putin since 2001. A speech that Putin held at Germany's lower house of parliament in 2001, speaking German to lawmakers, gave Steinmeier hope for better relations between Moscow and Berlin, he told Spiegel magazine in an interview published earlier on Tuesday. ""That Putin from the year 2001 has nothing in common with the Putin of 2022, who we are now experiencing as a brutal, entrenched warmonger,"" Steinmeier said.

4/13/2022,"More than a dozen Los Angeles gangs are targeting some of the city's wealthiest residents in a new and aggressive manner, sending out crews in multiple cars to find, follow and rob people driving high-end vehicles or wearing expensive jewelry, according to police. In many cases, they're making off with designer handbags, diamond-studded watches and other items worth tens of thousands of dollars — if not more — and then peddling them to black-market buyers who are willing to turn a blind eye to the underlying violence, police said. In some cases, suspects have been arrested but then released from custody — only to commit additional robberies, police said. Those are among the conclusions of a Los Angeles Police Department task force convened at the end of last year to identify the cause of a sudden surge in ""follow home,"" or ""follow off,"" robberies, so called because victims are robbed soon after leaving luxury boutiques and hotels, ritzy restaurants, trendy nightclubs and other locations where the gangs are scouting for targets. According to Capt. Jonathan Tippet, who spearheads the task force, police have identified at least 17 gangs, most based out of South L.A. and operating independently, that are involved. There were 165 such robberies in 2021 and 56 so far this year, he said, including several over the weekend. The area with the most robberies during that time was the LAPD's Hollywood Division, with 50, followed by 46 in the Wilshire Division and 40 in the Central Division, which includes downtown. The Pacific Division had 17, West L.A. 15, North Hollywood 14 and Topanga 11. Tippet did not say how many robberies police attributed to which gangs, but said individuals allegedly affiliated with both the Bloods and Crips have been identified among the culprits. Suspects who police have identified have pleaded not guilty, and their cases are pending. The task force is still working to build cases against other suspects. Through surveillance video and other evidence, police have identified crews rolling three to five cars deep in some of the attacks, Tippet said, with gang members jumping out and blindsiding victims. ""There's no chance or opportunity for these victims even to comply. They're just running up to people and attacking them, whether that's putting a gun in their face or punching them and beating on them,"" Tippet said. ""Pistol whipping them as well."" Shots have been fired in 23 cases, and two victims have been killed, said Tippet, who also heads the LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division, which investigates high-profile crimes. ""In my 34 years on the job, I've never seen anything like this,"" he said. The trend, in a city known for opulence as well as extreme poverty, comes at a time when crime overall is under a microscope — with homicides, shootings and armed robberies all at elevated levels since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and candidates in the city's ongoing mayoral race denouncing those increases as they vie for voters and wealthy donors. That intense focus has also caused some consternation among activists and criminal justice reform advocates, who worry that wealthy residents with political clout and politicians eager to please them will use the trend — based in part on fraught and sometimes false police assessments of gang involvement — to claw back past policing reforms. One prominent activist, Hamid Khan, on Tuesday accused the LAPD of ""week after week of sensationalism"" about crime in the city, suggesting police were blowing crime trends out of proportion to maintain their grip on the city's budget. ""LAPD has to constantly legitimize itself, constantly has to make itself useful to the community, by raising this specter of people running wild,"" Khan said. Police said their intent is simply to draw attention to — and halt — a serious and potentially deadly surge in armed robberies. Still, much of the increasing violence has affected not the wealthy, but the city's more vulnerable populations, such as people who are homeless or live in poor communities, and receives little notice. The follow-off robberies first started gaining attention toward the end of last year, when the number of incidents spiked dramatically and celebrities started to fall victim — including actor and former BET host Terrence Jenkins and ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" star Dorit Kemsley. In a four-week period from September to October, there were 45 follow-off robberies. In November, there were another 39, Tippet said. LAPD Chief Michel Moore announced the formation of the task force that month. Tippet was set to brief the civilian Police Commission on the task force's work since then on Tuesday. In an interview with The Times, Tippet said that work — and particularly the arrests of some of the alleged gang members — has made a substantial difference, driving down the number of incidents to just 10 in March. However, the trend is still a major concern, he said, in part because those same suspects keep getting released from jail and reoffending while awaiting trial. ""I am absolutely frustrated,"" he said. Similar frustration was shared last week by Moore, when he took the unusual step of briefing the Police Commission on the alleged actions of one such suspect: 18-year-old Matthew Adams. Adams, according to Moore, was involved in eight separate follow-off robberies over a sixth-month period starting last fall, including one in which two UCLA students were robbed of two watches worth nearly $145,000 after leaving a club, a second in which two foreign tourists were robbed of watches worth $73,000, and a third in which $51,000 in property was stolen. During the course of the eight robberies, which occurred between September and February, Adams was arrested three times. The first time was on Jan. 9, when Moore said Adams was found in a car that had been used in one of the robberies and where a gun was also found. Online court records show no charges were ever filed against Adams in that case, suggesting prosecutors were unconvinced they could win a conviction. Adams was arrested again on Jan. 27 and a third time on Feb. 21, and in both cases charged with illegal gun possession. Court records show he was ordered released each time without having to pay bail. The reason was a pandemic-related rule, aimed at reducing the jail population, that requires L.A. County defendants to be released without posting bail for certain offenses. Adams, who could not be reached for comment, has since been arrested a fourth time on charges related to seven robberies, to which he has pleaded not guilty. The public defender's office, which represented him during his arraignment, declined to comment on the case. He remains in custody, according to court records. Moore said Adams' earlier and repeated releases from custody endangered public safety, and that people who are repeatedly arrested for gun crimes should not be let out before trial. He also suggested that prosecutors played a part by not seeking certain charging enhancements to those brought against Adams that might have kept him in jail. Moore said he was ""disappointed"" that ""the full weight of our existing laws"" was not brought down on Adams — not only to hold him accountable, but to provide a disincentive for other would-be robbers who might think such crimes are going unpunished in L.A. When asked about Moore's claims, a spokesman for L.A. County Dist. Atty. George Gascón's office said Adams was not legally eligible for gun enhancements on the two possession charges. Gascón's office did file gun enhancements in the latest case against Adams, the spokesman said. In a separate case, a man named Cheyenne Hale, 25, was arrested this month on suspicion of participating in the armed robbery of a man in downtown L.A. in October in which two watches estimated to be worth about $600,000 were stolen. Police said they recovered a loaded gun from Hale during his arrest and that detectives in Tippet's unit later found seven additional handguns, $21,000 in cash and ""a large quantity of drugs"" including cocaine and methamphetamine when they served a search warrant at Hale's home. Nonetheless, Hale — who could not be reached for comment — has since been released from custody, according to court records. Following Moore's presentation last week, Police Commission President William Briggs said that the pretrial release of individuals allegedly involved in violent robberies at gunpoint represented a failure of the criminal justice system. ""This revolving-door criminal justice system that we have right now clearly is not working and is endangering the citizens of Los Angeles and is creating a public safety crisis,"" Briggs said. ""We need to find a solution."" Other commissioners seemed wary of focusing too intensely on Adams or any other individual defendant, particularly before they'd had their day in court. Commissioner Dale Bonner said discussions about individual ""career criminals"" have been misused by politicians to stoke fear in the community and advance questionable criminal justice initiatives in the past, and that the current discussion should not fail to recognize that. Tippet said his task force would continue investigating such crimes, and that he hopes that its work will encourage those engaged in such robberies to stop doing what they're doing. He also said that people who are buying the watches, handbags and other goods being stolen during such robberies should also stop what they're doing — because the task force is coming after them as well as part of multiple open investigations. ""They are participating"" in the crime, too, Tippet said.

4/13/2022,"GoFundMe The parents of a 3-year-old girl who died when she fell over a waterfall say she was a ""piece of heaven"" to everyone who knew her. On Sunday, Nevaeh Jade Newswanger and her family were visiting Whitewater Falls in North Carolina for a hiking trip when the young girl ""slipped and fell in the water"" while playing in the nearby sand, a GoFundMe set up for the family says. Though her parents did their best to retrieve her, Neveah was carried by the powerful current down the waterfall and later found dead, the page explains. ""We desperately tried to rescue her but the current was so strong and it swept her down the river and over the falls where the angels caught her,"" her parents, Keith and Sheri Newswanger, said in a message on the donation page. ""She is now our precious angel, so radiant in the presence of God,"" they added. ""Her name is heaven spelled backwards. She was truly a piece of heaven to all who knew her.""
