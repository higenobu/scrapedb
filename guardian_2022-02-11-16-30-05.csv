2/11/2022,"Britain’s economy contracted by 0.2% in December as government restrictions to limit the spread of the Omicron variant dented consumer spending. Shortages of goods in the shops in the run-up to Christmas and a record number of job vacancies also slowed the economy after a 0.9% increase in November.  City economists polled by Reuters expected a more severe drop of 0.6%. In the final quarter of the year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said GDP growth slowed to 1% from a downwardly revised 1.1% in the three months to the end of September. However, the sustained recovery since the spring of last year pushed GDP growth to 7.5% across the whole of 2021, marking the strongest annual of expansion since the second world war. In 2020, during the first phase of the pandemic, the UK suffered one of the largest annual economic contractions of any major economy when GDP plunged by 9.4%.",News/Business,UK economy contracts by 0.2% as Omicron dents spending,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/11/uk-economy-contracts-omicron-dents-spending
2/11/2022,"Finding the right host for 7:30 will be no easy task. Just ask the ABC executives who stumbled momentarily when they replaced the towering figure of Kerry O’Brien with not one, but two, journalists in 2010. They also decided to change the name of “The 7.30 Report” to just “7:30”, something that still irks viewers.  Such a pleasure and a privilege to have worked with @leighsales over the years. Consummate professional, first-rate journo and a very fine human.    💐🙏 pic.twitter.com/MK0t9plx2m It’s a distant memory now, but Leigh Sales was not given the job of solo host initially. She was one half of a double-header with Chris Uhlmann, then an ABC political reporter. At the time, the Age called it “an unwieldy hosting policy that looked like a plot from Australian newsroom satire Frontline”. It didn’t last. Uhlmann eventually returned to being political editor while Sales hosted alone and a new executive producer, Sally Neighbour, was brought on at the end of 2012. A footnote to this is that Sales is being talked about as a replacement for Uhlmann, who has indicated he will retire after the election as Nine’s political editor. But given she wants to spend evenings at home with her two boys, 10 and 8, and she would have to live in Canberra, it seems unlikely. While it is too early to say who will succeed Sales, the ABC only has to look internally to find a rich list of contenders. She’s new to television, but viewers seem to love political editor Laura Tingle. The show requires a Sydney or Melbourne host and Tingle is based in Canberra. Another one to watch is investigative reporter Sarah Ferguson, who returns from the US this year. She has been reporting from the States since her posting to China was aborted when she couldn’t get a visa. Ferguson hosted while Sales was on maternity leave, and has established herself as a tough political interviewer. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While she seems to prefer radio, Fran Kelly, who stood down from RN Breakfast very recently, can’t be ruled out. Kelly was once the show’s political editor. Virginia Trioli seems to be thriving in the morning radio shift at ABC Melbourne. But she is a formidable interviewer and could also be a good fit. Then there is David Speers, Insiders host, and Stan Grant, the ABC’s international affairs analyst and presenter of China Tonight. Sales says interviewing Paul McCartney and getting a hug from him was “one of the best days of my life”, and viewers certainly shared in her joy. “In all the years I’ve anchored, I’ve never had more viewers come up to me in public than after that interview to say how much joy it gave them, and it was so beautiful that people felt as if they had shared in that experience with me.” Her interview with John Laws in 2012 was another standout, although she left it out of her list of memorable moments when announcing her decision to leave on Thursday. The legendary radio broadcaster agreed to come on 7:30 and talk about his old rival Alan Jones, but ended up flirting with Sales as he nursed a glass of whisky. “I did enjoy it. Did you?” said Sales at the end of the interview.“Yeah, I loved every minute,” Laws said. Sales had big shoes to fill, taking over from O’Brien on 7:30, and then five years later taking on panel and hosting duties for the ABC’s 2016 federal election broadcast. Election hosting was a role which had been O’Brien’s domain for decades. At 1am, after a record-breaking seven-plus hours of anchoring the live broadcast, Sales said: “Yeah, we’ve broken the record. Suck on that, Kerry O’Brien,” dissolving the panel, which included Scott Morrison, into fits of laughter and creating a memorable television moment. ABC colleague Virginia Trioli congratulated Sales for surviving “the toughest gig in the toughest of partisan times”, and even Sales’ harshest critics would have to give her that. While she wasn’t targeted by the Murdoch press like some other ABC presenters, she was relentlessly trolled on Twitter. She says she had one goal, “and that is to ask frank questions of people in power, without fear or favour”. But some armchair critics on Twitter repeatedly accuse her of going soft on conservatives and too hard on Labor. When I remember, I’ve been saving sexualised social media abuse to show you what all women in the public eye get constantly, whether you are Peta Credlin, Julia Gillard or anyone in between. Check my @ mentions after any big interview to see for yourself. pic.twitter.com/RwPpWxz62w Last year, in a piece for ABC Online, she wrote: “Anyone who can stomach wading into mentions of @leighsales will find that virtually hourly, I am abused for doing my job, with a stream of tweets goading me to quit, demanding the ABC sack me, telling me I’m useless, stupid, biased and incompetent.” Sales is not alone. ABC News Breakfast co-host Lisa Millar has abandoned Twitter after a torrent of abuse about everything from her interview style to whether she smiles. Sales has also, quite literally, had missiles lobbed at her. She showed her characteristic toughness when she ducked a flying yoghurt pot aimed at her while she was speaking at an event in Perth in 2019. Covered in splashes of blueberry yoghurt, Sales told the audience “If everyone else is alright, I’m quite happy to go on. That was a waste of some perfectly good yoghurt, I’m afraid.” Totally stunned at our house to hear Leigh Sales say she’s leaving @abc730 And also happy for her boys, bigger than this photo now, who want their Mum home. Thank you so much for years of brilliant journalism.

2/11/2022,"The police officer who made a plan to arrest Kumanjayi Walker has denied the main reason she wanted the operation to start in the morning was so she could have a sleep, a court has heard. Yuendumu’s Sgt Julie Frost also denied she deliberately withheld evidence, during heated cross-examination in the trial of constable Zachary Rolfe on Friday.  Rolfe, 30, is charged with murdering Walker, 19, in the remote community of Yuendumu on 9 November 2019. He has pleaded not guilty to murder and to two alternate charges. Frost was the officer in charge of Yuendumu station, about 300km north-west of Alice Springs, when Walker was shot dead. The Northern Territory supreme court has previously heard Frost requested officers from the immediate response team (IRT) to travel to Yuendumu on 9 November 2019 because of a series of issues within the community, and to assist in the arrest of Walker the following day. Rolfe, three colleagues in the IRT, which handles high-risk arrests, and an officer trained to handle police dogs, arrived in Yuendumu from Alice Springs later that day. Frost said she briefed the officers that they were to conduct high-visibility patrols of the community, familiarise themselves with the town, and gather intelligence on Walker, with a view to arresting him the following morning. Little more than 15 minutes after the briefing, Walker had been located by the officers and shot three times by Rolfe. He died about an hour later. Under cross-examination by David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, Frost denied that in a conversation with Rolfe immediately before the briefing she told him the plan to arrest Walker the following day would allow her to have a sleep. She agreed she wanted to rest after a busy period in the town, but that the morning arrest was a tactical decision designed to reduce the risk of a confrontation with Walker, who had threatened two police with an axe three days earlier. When Edwardson asked if she had told Rolfe that she had spent much of the past three days locked in the police station, and therefore had no intelligence on where Walker could be, she said she had never told him that. She also denied a suggestion by Edwardson that she had not printed copies of the operational plans for Rolfe and her colleagues, as she had said in evidence on Thursday. Supt Jody Nobbs, who oversees policing in 11 remote communities in the southern desert region, including Yuendumu, also gave evidence on Friday. He said that in a phone call with Frost on the morning of 9 November 2019, she told him she suspected Walker was responsible for a series of break-ins in Yuendumu, including at the house of the nurse in charge of the local clinic. The break-ins, which had not previously been reported to police, had prompted local medical staff to contact Frost telling her they planned to evacuate Yuendumu that day. The evacuation of medical staff, a large funeral scheduled to take place, the spate of break-ins, and the need to arrest Walker were all mentioned by Frost to Nobbs as reasons for the request for more resources, including the IRT. The funeral had been for a relative of Walker, and the court has previously heard that he had escaped from an alcohol rehabilitation facility in Alice Springs and removed an electronic monitoring bracelet as he wanted to attend. Nobbs said he and Frost discussed arresting Walker at the funeral, but decided against it. The court has previously heard Walker was shot by Rolfe after he pulled a pair of medical scissors from his pocket and brought them down in a stabbing motion into Rolfe’s left shoulder. A colleague of Rolfe, constable Adam Eberl, then struggled with Walker, who was shot soon after by Rolfe. The first shot is not subject to any charges but the second and third shots, which the prosecution alleges were fired several seconds later from close range by Rolfe when Eberl had control of Walker, are the basis for the murder charge. Edwardson has previously told the court Rolfe would defend his actions as being reasonable and justifiable in the context of the danger faced by him and Eberl. Edwardson said Rolfe was acting in self-defence, and to defend the life of Eberl, when he fired the second and third shots and his training emphasised that “edged weapon equals gun”. The defence also disputes that Eberl had control of Walker when the second and third shots were fired.

2/11/2022,"Start Bowden Bridge car park (£5 in coins)Distance 8¾ milesTime 5 hoursTotal ascent 662 metresDifficulty Moderate, harder in bad weather  This article includes content provided by Google. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. We leave the car at Bowden Bridge, a nondescript small car park in a deep forested glade by a rushing stream called the Kinder. There is a pay-and-display machine that accepts money, but gives no tickets. We have the place to ourselves – unsurprisingly, as a relentless shower of sleet is being slung in our faces as we set out. Almost 90 years ago, a much larger crowd left this same car park: more than 400 people were ready to march up on to Kinder Scout, risking prosecution and a battering from the Duke of Devonshire’s hired thugs. This is the spot where the mass trespass of 24 April 1932 began, a day celebrated by honest hillwalkers ever after, and a day groused about by get-orf-my-estate types. It was arguably the day the idea of British national parks and trails changed from a pipe dream to an inevitability, although it did take a further 17 years to achieve. And it was only one battle in a war that continues: a conflict between privileged privacy and everyone else. Our plan had been to emulate those pioneers and head up the ravine known as William Clough, but that route, I know, is slippery and steep and crisscrosses the stream many times, not a pleasant prospect in current conditions. So we take the easier ascent, hoping to come back that way when the weather has relented. We follow a motorable lane that bends to the south, passing stands of pine trees and distant views of cloud-topped fells. There is no one around but down this trail comes, to our astonishment, a Bentley. Then we notice a small fishing lake tucked away behind a high wire fence with a sign saying: “No entry. Guarded by attack dogs.” I peer through the wire, but the hounds of Hooray are not to be seen. We leave the rough road behind and the footpath starts to ascend. There are no more houses, trees or Bentleys. This is what the wage-slaves of Manchester were seeking: the feeling you get when the line is crossed and you enter the wild upper realms of tussock, tup and heather. There is also plenty of snow in deep untrodden drifts as we follow the rough track alongside Oaken Clough and reach the medieval gritstone monument known as Edale Cross, reputedly erected by Cistercian monks in 1157. Carry on westwards from here and you would pass the Jacob’s Ladder waterfall, but we turn north, taking the ridgeline over Kinder Low and on to Kinder Downfall. The trail is fairly easy to follow, being paved with stone slabs, although large snow drifts do occasionally complicate matters. The Downfall is a 30-metre waterfall tucked into a deep cleft that gathers the westerly wind so efficiently that the water is frequently blown straight back up the rock, a spectacular sight worth seeing. We jump across the stream and continue through a vicious sleet storm to the head of William Clough, the narrow gulch that leads back down. This route is so well-trodden these days that it is hard to imagine it was once off-limits to most people. Hill walking had become a popular pastime by the 1930s and the limited number of public footpaths would get crowded on Sundays, the only free day for most working people. The well-mannered and polite campaigning of some rambling organisations had achieved almost nothing and one 20-year-old hiker, Benny Rothman from Manchester, was determined to break the stalemate. From the quarry car park he and the others – including a “special correspondent from the Manchester Guardian” – walked up William Clough and fought “a brief but vigorous hand-to-hand struggle” with the gamekeepers, pushing their way to the ridge, where they held a victory celebration. At the head of William Clough, I do not feel victorious. The sleet is driving into my face so hard that it hurts. We are soaked through and shivering. The clough is a deep slithery defile and we have to make numerous crossings before we finally reach the Kinder reservoir, regain the road and make it back to the car – with its blessed heater. The trespassers had better weather, but their luck ran out as they walked back into Hayfield village. Six of them were arrested and later charged with unlawful assembly. Rothman was sentenced to four months in Leicester prison, a vindictive sentence that did a lot to gather public support for the right to roam. Whether the mass trespass helped or hindered the campaign is still the subject of debate; it certainly divided opinion at the time. In 1935, Harvey Jackson, an 18-year-old who had marched with the trespass, applied to join Derbyshire police and found himself interviewed by the man who had arrested Benny Rothman, assistant chief constable James Garrow. Reading his application form, Garrow noticed a list of hobbies and frowned. “Jackson,” he said disapprovingly, “we do not like hill walkers in Derbyshire. They are not welcome.” That kind of attitude, thankfully, is long gone. Less than a mile from the car park is the village of Hayfield, which the protest marchers walked through, and it has several pubs. We reach the Pack Horse, which was taken over by Luke Payne and Emma Daniels a few years ago and is making a name for itself with its great food. A delicious cauliflower and Lincolnshire Poacher cheese soup gets me started, followed by mutton merguez sausages with lentils and roots vinaigrette. All the meat comes from the local butcher, with plenty of High Peak lamb on offer. If the food is upmarket, the ambience is still local and friendly, with a quiz night on Wednesdays, two log-burners and local hand-pulled ales – with which we raise a toast to Benny Rothman and his fellow valiant campaigners.thepackhorsehayfield.uk The Pack Horse does not have rooms, but can recommend several B&Bs and cottages in the area. We stay in one of two cottages at Overlea Farm (seven nights from £578): ours has a hot tub, which is a joy after an icy day. These spacious conversions are done to a high spec – the smart TV is linked to a Sonos sound system and iPad room controls – but best of all they are kept warm and cosy by an air-source heat pump.",Lifestyle/Travel,"A great walk to a great pub: the Pack Horse, Hayfield, Peak District",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/11/a-great-walk-to-a-great-pub-the-pack-horse-hayfield-peak-district
2/11/2022,"Around 9.30am on 15 January of this year, Michelle Go was waiting for a train at Times Square subway station. Go, 40, a senior manager at Deloitte, was on her way to work. As she was checking her phone, a man shoved her from behind as a train roared into the station. She was hit by the incoming train and killed. Go’s murder prompted shock and outrage. She was of Asian descent, at a time when anti-Asian hate crimes have been surging across New York City, including in the subways. The chief suspect in her killing, Martial Simon, has two violent felonies on his record and a warrant out for allegedly violating his parole. He reportedly had a history of severe mental illness, including schizophrenia, and had cycled between hospitals and jails over the years; the New York Times reported he was unhoused. Although police said there was no indication that Go’s death was an anti-Asian hate crime, prosecutors said they were examining “every piece of evidence to determine if defendant’s actions were motivated by racial bias”.  Whoever her alleged killer is, or whatever his motives, Go’s death seemed to crystallize many New Yorkers’ sense of fear that their subway, infamously dangerous decades ago, was once again becoming unsafe – due to random crime or an influx of at-risk persons acting erratically, or both. The new mayor, Eric Adams, has responded forcefully. A former police captain who ran for office on law-and-order talking points, Adams said Go’s death “just really doubled down on our concerns that our system must be safe”. He referred to the way some New Yorkers now “feel as though there’s a total level of disorder in our subway system”. Joe Biden descended on New York City last week to meet Adams and New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, at the New York police department headquarters, to discuss rising crime across the US. The president’s visit, which focused on curbing gun crime across New York and other major US cities, came after the killings of NYPD officers Jason Rivera and Wilbert Mora, who were shot last month responding to a domestic violence call. “The answer is not to defund the police,” Biden said. “It’s to give you the tools, the training, the funding to be partners, to be protectors – and the community needs you. Know the community.” Adams had already vowed to make police an “omnipresence” in the subway, adding 50,000 citywide subway inspectors from 6 January to 26 January and deploying an additional 1,000 extra officers into subways daily. The political response, however, simplifies what is an incredibly complicated story now playing out over safety, not just on the subway but citywide. The subways are statistically quite safe, compared with previous decades – albeit somewhat less safe than a few years ago. Rates of violent crime per million passengers have increased since 2019, according to the New York Times; and while New York remains one of the safest cities in the US, the city reports that in 2021 “the most serious crimes were up 5% from the previous year, including murders that have been on the rise since 2018”. But, overall crime is nowhere near late-1980s and 1990s highs. The definition of safety, however, varies dramatically depending who you talk to. Many female New Yorkers say the statistics don’t tell the whole story. “No, I don’t feel safe,” said Tanya Murphy, a 40-year-old massage therapy student. “Tragedies of people being pushed, you know, these just reinforce feeling unsafe, and … my friends, or people I know, they’re always like, ‘Hey, be careful in the subway.’” Therin Pressley, 55, who was in the Times Square subway station on a recent Wednesday with three dogs, raising money for animals, believed the pandemic’s impact on the economy and mental health had contributed to violent crime on the subways. “I feel safe in a way because, look at me: I’m 6ft 5in, I’m like 200lb. I don’t look like an easy [prey],” he said, but added: “You got guys out here pulling guns on buses, trains … You have cops out here being shot, so you’re not safe anywhere.” Jorge Arteaga, deputy director at the anti-street harassment organization Hollaback!, said that safety in public spaces is often thought of in the context of recorded physical violence, whereas menacing behavior should also be considered. “What are we defining as safety, or making the trains safer – are people still being cursed at? Hit? Spit at?” Arteaga said. Harassment often goes unreported, especially if it doesn’t rise to a criminal level, meaning official metrics don’t always accurately convey experiences – and women, especially women of color, are disproportionately affected by inappropriate encounters, Arteaga said. “On paper, technically, what people are tracking – yeah it looks like it’s safer. In reality, when you go and speak to the people in the community, do they feel safer? Probably not.” Pandemic-fueled declines in ridership have also changed the feeling on the subway, he said. “If something were to happen to me on the train, do I feel like someone will meaningfully step in to support me?” Arteaga said. “Mostly, a lot of people would say ‘no.’” Safety is not just about physical attacks, agreed Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Los Angeles-based AAPI Equity Alliance. “When we think of what it means, especially for women in our community but even just women generally: What are the ways in which we have modified our lives because we feel unsafe?” Neither Kulkarni nor Arteaga believe that ramped-up policing would necessarily solve these problems. Kulkarni said advocates want more discussion about practical ways to address the feeling of safety – such as ensuring adequate lighting in stations, and staff around to help. “Many, many incidents have happened – both women and men in our community, and those who are non-binary – involving threatening behavior on public transit. So how do we essentially stop that?” she said. Christopher Herrmann, a former crime statistics analyst for the New York police department who now teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice emphasized that the subways are still very safe, but noted that low ridership can be associated with changes in the types of crimes that occur. “The chances of being a victim in the New York City subway have always been one in a million or higher,” Herrmann said. “The chances of winning the lottery are similar to the chances of being victimized – it’s really that low. “When we see low ridership like we have now, sometimes we see some of the more violent kind of crime because, I think, the bad guys don’t see a lot of people around – they feel kind of more emboldened that no one’s going to kind of step in and be a good Samaritan.” What’s more, the subways have long been home to a large number of unhoused people like the suspect in Go’s murder, a fact that the pandemic – with its effect on the economy and on declining ridership – has brought to the fore. Beanca Beleno, who takes the subway home from her kitchen job late at night, said she sees a lot of erratic people on the train now. There’s the person who smokes. There’s the person who rants. There are people sleeping. “I can tell that it’s been worse, especially now. The Omicron is going on, and then it’s winter,” Beleno said. “They’re just all over on all the subway stations, all the trains.” Subway employees, too, are concerned about the number of people with mental health troubles, whose problems they are not charged with addressing. “Our workforce is scared,” the Metropolitan Transportation Authority chair and CEO, Janno Lieber, told a press conference last month. “In addition to our passengers, our workforce is struggling because they’re feeling vulnerable – because when they go to clean and they turn a corner, they’re coming upon … people with conditions that are unpredictable.” For many of the unhoused persons who seek shelter in the subways, treatment for mental health and substance abuse remains out of reach. “The reason that people are seeing folks on the subway who don’t have an obvious destination is because they don’t have a place to live – it’s that simple,” said Joshua Goldfein, staff attorney with the Legal Aid Society’s homeless rights project. “I think every New Yorker would tell you that they see more unhoused people on the subway than they used to. That doesn’t mean there are more people,” Goldfein said. “It seems safe to say that the problem has become more visible – and the reason for that, again, is that we have not provided enough alternative places for those people to live or to stay.” Advocates stress that they don’t think being unhoused, or having mental illness and substance abuse issues, makes you inherently dangerous, but that vulnerable people living without support in bustling, open spaces was of concern for everyone. “Anytime that you have somebody who is in need of a higher level of care than they’re getting – who’s in a stressful environment where they can’t get any rest, and they’re not able to regularly access their medication – there’s certainly going to be a heightened risk of negative interaction with other people,” Goldfein said. Asked about their strategy for helping unhoused people on subways, New York City social and homeless services officials said the agency had ramped up outreach and intensified their efforts at end-of-line and high-traffic subway stations. City-canvassing outreach staff had tripled in recent years, to 600, they said; Hochul recently announced the state would send in behavioral health specialists to help on the subways, who will help connect unhoused persons with social services and shelter. There is some cautious optimism that the measures could help. “We’re excited that this is happening,” Lieber said recently. “We know where a lot of these chronically homeless people who are experiencing mental health issues are – we just need to keep creating a system that gets them, first of all, off the platforms and off the trains [and then] into a long-term, supportive situation … But most of all, protect our riders from these experiences that are happening. That’s our focus,” Lieber said. “The issue is not the number of outreach workers. It’s what resources they have behind them.”",News/US news,New York’s subways are safe statistically – but that’s not the full story,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/10/new-yorks-subways-safe-statistically-women-crime-policing
2/11/2022," “Am I livestock?” It’s a dramatic question being asked by a woman who has just awoken, face down on a conference table with no idea of her own name. This moody thriller takes the issue of work-life balance and goes full Black Mirror with it. The employees who haunt the backlit, featureless corridors of Lumon Industries have undergone a procedure to separate their consciousness of work and personal lives. The result is obliteration but, arguably, a sort of freedom too. It’s a haunting, Kafkaesque affair, with Adam Scott starring as Mark Scout – an employee who finds himself entangled in the mystery at the heart of the company.Apple TV+, from Friday 18 February Some people felt that season three of this debonair comedy suffered for leaving New York and setting off on tour. But as we rejoin Midge (Rachel Brosnahan), her gig with Shy Baldwin has careered off the rails and she’s back to square one. Possibly worse than square one, in fact, since her manager Susie (Alex Borstein) has gambled away their money. There’s a wonderful set piece on a Coney Island ferris wheel during which Midge’s problems are loudly itemised, but part of the delight of this show is its breezy insouciance: Midge is sufficiently talented and self-possessed to stroll out of the tightest of spots.Amazon Prime Video, from Friday 18 February Is it possible to imagine anyone other than Will Smith as Will Smith? We’re about to find out as this reboot of the anticipated 90s comedy drops. This time, the tone is radically different; Will’s life is distinctly less happy-go-lucky as we learn why he relocated from Philly to Cali. It is, at heart, a tale of class, racism and systemic inequality as the beefs of Will’s past threaten to cloud his new, gated, pristine life. Decidedly less fun than the original series, then. Newcomer Jabari Banks is the man with the task of bringing Will back to life.Peacock on Sky, from Monday 14 February After chemotherapy for childhood cancer, Shauna Rae went into remission, but it had a side-effect. The treatment disabled her pituitary gland and she stopped growing. Now, she’s a 22-year-old woman stuck in an eight-year-old’s body. This startling series tracks her attempts to navigate young adulthood. It’s hard not to smile at certain incidents – particularly at the double-takes Shauna receives in bars and tattoo parlours. But being taken seriously – professionally and romantically – is a constant battle. Happily, it’s one she seems well-equipped to fight.Discovery+, from Monday 14 February The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now extended to the very meta exercise of making documentaries about the film-making process. It’s essentially that DVD staple, the bonus feature, repurposed for the content-hungry world of streaming to help meet fans’ insatiable appetite for extra content. Chloé Zhao’s 2021 film itself was lauded more for its production values than its complexity or nuance, so getting some insight into the behind-the-scenes details of such a gargantuan undertaking is bound to be fascinating.Disney+, from Wednesday 16 February Documentaries about creative lives tend to be at their best during the thrilling formative years; the ascent, the flowering, the will to power. This is doubly the case in a three-part series tracking Kanye West from nerdy, wildly talented college dropout with a backpack full of beats to creatively stalled Maga cap-wearing provocateur. It’s immediately clear that West’s life has been documented exhaustively and there’s a thrilling intimacy to the early stages of the documentary, which are an essential, warts-and-all evocation of the megastar as a young man.Netflix, from Wednesday 16 February Based on the video game Cuphead, this animation feels a natural fit for narrative development. It’s probably because the game itself is a curiously retro-styled affair whose aesthetic harks back to the first “golden age” of American animation with its cartoons from the Fleischer and Disney studios. As such, the quirky, sometimes charming stories – which follow the adventures of the mildly volatile Cuphead and his more measured brother Mugman – might very well have as much appeal to nostalgic adults as to their young offspring.Netflix, from Friday 18 February",Arts/Television & radio, Severance to Jeen-yuhs: the seven best shows to stream this week,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/11/severance-to-jeen-yuhs-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week
2/11/2022,"The head of Australia’s peak aged care body has linked New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet’s decision to lift Covid restrictions late last year to the deaths of hundreds of aged care residents. Appearing before a NSW parliamentary inquiry into the government’s response to Covid-19 on Friday, the chief executive of Aged and Community Services Australia, Paul Sadler, said his organisation – which represents not-for-profit aged care homes – had in December raised the risks posed to the sector from a widespread lifting of restrictions once cases of Omicron began appearing in the community.  “Of course what happened was the premier made the decision to continue down the pathway of opening up and within days the number of outbreaks in residential [facilities] skyrocketed and there are now hundreds of deaths in NSW in aged care since that decision was taken,” Sadler said. But the health minister, Brad Hazzard, told the inquiry he could not recall the advice, saying it “certainly wasn’t on my agenda” in the lead up to 15 December, and that the government had been “constantly weighing up” competing interests before reopening the state. Appearing ahead of Hazzard, Sadler told the committee that after the first case of Omicron was recorded in NSW at the end of November, he had urged the government “to be very careful” because of a lack of supply of rapid antigen tests and the risk of widespread staff shortages in the event of a large outbreak. “We were already flagging with the NSW government that, for goodness sake be very careful, we don’t think we’re prepared sufficiently because there’s not the supply of rapid antigen tests from the federal government yet [and] because there would be other potential consequences on the work force if there was widespread community transmission,” he said. But he said the warning was ignored. The government lifted a number of Covid-19 restrictions on 15 December, including on indoor mask mandates and density limits. The restrictions were reinstated eight days later on 23 December but Sadler said by then cases in the sector had “skyrocketed”. Sadler’s testimony was echoed by the chief executive of aged care provider Warrigal Care, Mark Sewell, who told the inquiry that during discussions with both aged care providers and the business community in the lead up to easing restrictions he witnessed “two worlds that clashed”. “It would be fair to say it is universally accepted now that [the reopening] happened too quickly,” he said. “Inevitably it needed to happen for Australia to get back to work but it should have been delayed until the middle of January.” But appearing before the committee both Hazzard and the health secretary, Elizabeth Koff, said they could not recall being given that advice prior to lifting restrictions, with the minister saying the government had taken advice from both the health department as well as a number of other agencies. “We were certainly looking at all aspects of the community as we always have [but] that information certainly wasn’t something I remember being at the forefront of discussions,” Hazzard said.

Despite Covid case numbers exploding across Australia once the Omicron outbreak occurred, the decision by Perrottet to lift restrictions on 15 December has continued to dog the state government. Last month the Guardian revealed health officials in NSW had warned the government that vaccines “may be less effective” against the Omicron variant and could lead to an increase in hospitalisations, just days before Perrottet announced Covid-19 restrictions would be scrapped.",News/Australia news,NSW decision to lift Covid restrictions linked to hundreds of aged care deaths,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/11/nsw-decision-to-lift-covid-restrictions-linked-to-hundreds-of-aged-care-deaths
2/11/2022,"Good morning – Warren Murray bringing you the last but certainly not least consequential briefing of the week.  Cressida Dick has been forced out as head of the Metropolitan police after London’s mayor accused her of failing to deal with a culture of misogyny and racism in Britain’s biggest force. Sadiq Khan had previously put Dick “on notice” that she had to rapidly reform Scotland Yard or lose his support for her leadership. His confidence in her was shaken to breaking point by a scandal at Charing Cross police station where officers shared racist, sexist, misogynistic and Islamophobic messages. Dick is currently responsible for the “partygate” investigation, which could decide the fate of Boris Johnson as prime minister. As Peter Walker points out, if the investigation lingers beyond her tenure, it will be the hottest of political potatoes to pass to a successor. Here are some of the possible contenders. Dick will stay in her role for what is described as “a short period” while a new commissioner is appointed. A number of MPs called for Dick to resign in March 2021 after her officers arrested women taking part in a vigil for Sarah Everard, who had been murdered by one of their colleagues. In September the home secretary, Priti Patel, announced she had extended Dick’s five-year term for another 24 months, being unconvinced that any prospective successors were ready. Dick began as a constable in 1983 and became Met commissioner in 2017. Her career in the senior ranks has been battered by several controversies, including the notorious killing of Jean Charles de Menezes by police who thought he was a suicide bomber. ‘Warning time is going down’ – Boris Johnson said he feared Europe stood “on the edge of a precipice” as some experts declared Russia has assembled an invasion-ready force on the borders of Ukraine. After meeting Johnson, Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said: “The number of Russian forces is going up. The warning time for a possible attack is going down.” The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, held frosty discussions with her counterpart in Moscow and announced further sanctions legislation. Sergei Lavrov said it was a conversation of “the mute with the deaf”. Truss challenged Lavrov over his assertion that Russia is not threatening anyone: “I can’t see any other reason for having 100,000 troops stationed on the border,” she said. Keir Starmer also visited Nato’s headquarters and said Labour “is standing by the UK government’s approach”, but accused ministers of not doing enough to tackle Russian “dirty money” flowing into the UK. Starmer rebuked Britain’s Stop the War Coalition, which has Jeremy Corbyn in its leadership, as “naive” and giving “succour to authoritarian leaders who directly threaten democracies”. Overnight, Joe Biden has warned that “things could go crazy quickly” in Ukraine and urged American citizens to leave immediately. In Berlin last night, Russia and Ukraine said they had failed to reach any breakthrough in talks involving French and German officials. The UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is due to continue the diplomatic round in Moscow today. Net zero critics in small digits – MPs not fully behind net zero are “a small minority” and the government should stay committed to its climate crisis goals, a cross-party group of parliamentarians has said. It comes after the Guardian reported on the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) of 19 Conservatives, accused of attempting to derail the government’s green agenda. The chairs of eight all-party parliamentary groups, including on climate change, net zero, clean air and fuel poverty, have written a letter to the Guardian vowing they will “continue to support and promote ambitious environmental leadership in parliament”. Women’s audit at Holyrood – It will be “really disappointing” if the Scottish parliament cannot attract more female politicians within the next five years, says Holyrood’s presiding officer, as she launches a women’s audit to investigate barriers to representation and participation. Alison Johnstone, the equivalent of the Commons speaker, has suggested political parties are falling short in selecting female candidates, and signalled that the hybrid working arrangements used during lockdown and which suited working women in particular could become permanent. Last May’s elections returned the most diverse MSP group ever – 58 women, making up 45% of the parliament. But three female MSPs stood down, citing the difficulties of managing family life and their role. The audit will be led by a cross-party board of MSPs and academics. Better sleep may cut dementia – Researchers in the US have shed light on why Alzheimer’s disease is linked to people having experienced sleep disturbances years beforehand. The disease is related to plaques and tangles of proteins that steadily build up in the brain. Immune cells called microglia seek out and destroy these proteins. Dr Jennifer Hurley, who led the research at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, has described how microglia work on a circadian rhythm which, if disturbed, hampers their work. “Good sleep hygiene” could therefore help to tackle Alzheimer’s. Hurley said it might also be possible to stimulate the clean-up with simple interventions such as exposure to light, or more sophisticated therapies that boost activity of immune cells. They were accused of sorcery but they were just ordinary women. Libby Brooks reports on a Scottish campaign to pardon those persecuted in witch trials 300 years ago.

The 15-year-old Russian skater Kamila Valieva tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine in a sample collected on Christmas Day, the Independent Testing Agency has confirmed. The sample was analysed by a Swedish laboratory only on Tuesday 8 February, after she led her team to gold in figure-skating. It is still unclear whether the team will lose their medal or if Valieva will be allowed to compete further. In the Premier League, a Diogo Jota double sank goalless Leicester to maintain Liverpool’s title pursuit. Gabriel Martinelli’s first-half tap-in against Wolves was enough to secure Arsenal’s first win in six games, only for him to be sent off in the second half. Scotland have followed the Springboks’ lead and changed their entire front row for their Six Nations clash against Wales; while the odds on what was shaping up to be the most evenly poised match of this Six Nations took a sudden lurch after the Ireland captain, Johnny Sexton, was ruled out of Saturday’s game against France with a hamstring strain. The Aston Martin drivers Sebastian Vettel and Lance Stroll have criticised Formula One for putting entertainment before the sport at last season’s controversial and decisive Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The drivers accused the FIA and F1 of poor judgment in the decision-making that cost Lewis Hamilton the title. The continued rise in US inflation and the threat of more interest rates rises by the US Federal Reserve to combat soaring prices has put markets on edge in Asia overnight.
