1/9/2022,"Isaac Newton apocryphally discovered his second law – the one about gravity – after an apple fell on his head. Much experimentation and data analysis later, he realised there was a fundamental relationship between force, mass and acceleration. He formulated a theory to describe that relationship – one that could be expressed as an equation, F=ma – and used it to predict the behaviour of objects other than apples. His predictions turned out to be right (if not always precise enough for those who came later). Contrast how science is increasingly done today. Facebook’s machine learning tools predict your preferences better than any psychologist. AlphaFold, a program built by DeepMind, has produced the most accurate predictions yet of protein structures based on the amino acids they contain. Both are completely silent on why they work: why you prefer this or that information; why this sequence generates that structure.  You can’t lift a curtain and peer into the mechanism. They offer up no explanation, no set of rules for converting this into that – no theory, in a word. They just work and do so well. We witness the social effects of Facebook’s predictions daily. AlphaFold has yet to make its impact felt, but many are convinced it will change medicine. Somewhere between Newton and Mark Zuckerberg, theory took a back seat. In 2008, Chris Anderson, the then editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, predicted its demise. So much data had accumulated, he argued, and computers were already so much better than us at finding relationships within it, that our theories were being exposed for what they were – oversimplifications of reality. Soon, the old scientific method – hypothesise, predict, test – would be relegated to the dustbin of history. We’d stop looking for the causes of things and be satisfied with correlations. With the benefit of hindsight, we can say that what Anderson saw is true (he wasn’t alone). The complexity that this wealth of data has revealed to us cannot be captured by theory as traditionally understood. “We have leapfrogged over our ability to even write the theories that are going to be useful for description,” says computational neuroscientist Peter Dayan, director of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen, Germany. “We don’t even know what they would look like.” But Anderson’s prediction of the end of theory looks to have been premature – or maybe his thesis was itself an oversimplification. There are several reasons why theory refuses to die, despite the successes of such theory-free prediction engines as Facebook and AlphaFold. All are illuminating, because they force us to ask: what’s the best way to acquire knowledge and where does science go from here? The first reason is that we’ve realised that artificial intelligences (AIs), particularly a form of machine learning called neural networks, which learn from data without having to be fed explicit instructions, are themselves fallible. Think of the prejudice that has been documented in Google’s search engines and Amazon’s hiring tools. The second is that humans turn out to be deeply uncomfortable with theory-free science. We don’t like dealing with a black box – we want to know why. And third, there may still be plenty of theory of the traditional kind – that is, graspable by humans – that usefully explains much but has yet to be uncovered. So theory isn’t dead, yet, but it is changing – perhaps beyond recognition. “The theories that make sense when you have huge amounts of data look quite different from those that make sense when you have small amounts,” says Tom Griffiths, a psychologist at Princeton University. Griffiths has been using neural nets to help him improve on existing theories in his domain, which is human decision-making. A popular theory of how people make decisions when economic risk is involved is prospect theory, which was formulated by behavioural economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in the 1970s (it later won Kahneman a Nobel prize). The idea at its core is that people are sometimes, but not always, rational. In Science last June, Griffiths’s group described how they trained a neural net on a vast dataset of decisions people took in 10,000 risky choice scenarios, then compared how accurately it predicted further decisions with respect to prospect theory. They found that prospect theory did pretty well, but the neural net showed its worth in highlighting where the theory broke down, that is, where its predictions failed. These counter-examples were highly informative, Griffiths says, because they revealed more of the complexity that exists in real life. For example, humans are constantly weighing up probabilities based on incoming information, as prospect theory describes. But when there are too many competing probabilities for the brain to compute, they might switch to a different strategy – being guided by a rule of thumb, say – and a stockbroker’s rule of thumb might not be the same as that of a teenage bitcoin trader, since it is drawn from different experiences. “We’re basically using the machine learning system to identify those cases where we’re seeing something that’s inconsistent with our theory,” Griffiths says. The bigger the dataset, the more inconsistencies the AI learns. The end result is not a theory in the traditional sense of a precise claim about how people make decisions, but a set of claims that is subject to certain constraints. A way to picture it might be as a branching tree of “if… then”-type rules, which is difficult to describe mathematically, let alone in words. What the Princeton psychologists are discovering is still just about explainable, by extension from existing theories. But as they reveal more and more complexity, it will become less so – the logical culmination of that process being the theory-free predictive engines embodied by Facebook or AlphaFold. Some scientists are comfortable with that, even eager for it. When voice recognition software pioneer Frederick Jelinek said: “Every time I fire a linguist, the performance of the speech recogniser goes up,” he meant that theory was holding back progress – and that was in the 1980s. Or take protein structures. A protein’s function is largely determined by its structure, so if you want to design a drug that blocks or enhances a given protein’s action, you need to know its structure. AlphaFold was trained on structures that were derived experimentally, using techniques such as X-ray crystallography and at the moment its predictions are considered more reliable for proteins where there is some experimental data available than for those where there is none. But its reliability is improving all the time, says Janet Thornton, former director of the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) near Cambridge, and it isn’t the lack of a theory that will stop drug designers using it. “What AlphaFold does is also discovery,” she says, “and it will only improve our understanding of life and therapeutics.” Others are distinctly less comfortable with where science is heading. Critics point out, for example, that neural nets can throw up spurious correlations, especially if the datasets they are trained on are small. And all datasets are biased, because scientists don’t collect data evenly or neutrally, but always with certain hypotheses or assumptions in mind, assumptions that worked their way damagingly into Google’s and Amazon’s AIs. As philosopher of science Sabina Leonelli of the University of Exeter explains: “The data landscape we’re using is incredibly skewed.” But while these problems certainly exist, Dayan doesn’t think they’re insurmountable. He points out that humans are biased too and, unlike AIs, “in ways that are very hard to interrogate or correct”. Ultimately, if a theory produces less reliable predictions than an AI, it will be hard to argue that the machine is the more biased of the two. A tougher obstacle to the new science may be our human need to explain the world – to talk in terms of cause and effect. In 2019, neuroscientists Bingni Brunton and Michael Beyeler of the University of Washington, Seattle, wrote that this need for interpretability may have prevented scientists from making novel insights about the brain, of the kind that only emerges from large datasets. But they also sympathised. If those insights are to be translated into useful things such as drugs and devices, they wrote, “it is imperative that computational models yield insights that are explainable to, and trusted by, clinicians, end-users and industry”. “Explainable AI”, which addresses how to bridge the interpretability gap, has become a hot topic. But that gap is only set to widen and we might instead be faced with a trade-off: how much predictability are we willing to give up for interpretability? Sumit Chopra, an AI scientist who thinks about the application of machine learning to healthcare at New York University, gives the example of an MRI image. It takes a lot of raw data – and hence scanning time – to produce such an image, which isn’t necessarily the best use of that data if your goal is to accurately detect, say, cancer. You could train an AI to identify what smaller portion of the raw data is sufficient to produce an accurate diagnosis, as validated by other methods, and indeed Chopra’s group has done so. But radiologists and patients remain wedded to the image. “We humans are more comfortable with a 2D image that our eyes can interpret,” he says. The final objection to post-theory science is that there is likely to be useful old-style theory – that is, generalisations extracted from discrete examples – that remains to be discovered and only humans can do that because it requires intuition. In other words, it requires a kind of instinctive homing in on those properties of the examples that are relevant to the general rule. One reason we consider Newton brilliant is that in order to come up with his second law he had to ignore some data. He had to imagine, for example, that things were falling in a vacuum, free of the interfering effects of air resistance. In Nature last month, mathematician Christian Stump, of Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, called this intuitive step “the core of the creative process”. But the reason he was writing about it was to say that for the first time, an AI had pulled it off. DeepMind had built a machine-learning program that had prompted mathematicians towards new insights – new generalisations – in the mathematics of knots. In 2022, therefore, there is almost no stage of the scientific process where AI hasn’t left its footprint. And the more we draw it into our quest for knowledge, the more it changes that quest. We’ll have to learn to live with that, but we can reassure ourselves about one thing: we’re still asking the questions. As Pablo Picasso put it in the 1960s, “computers are useless. They can only give you answers.”",News/Technology,Are we witnessing the dawn of post-theory science?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/09/are-we-witnessing-the-dawn-of-post-theory-science

The British trio have gone viral on TikTok with archive track Greek Tragedy, and are booking shows from 200 to 20,000 capacity to promote this fifth album. Like Beautiful People Will Ruin Your Life (2018), Fix Yourself, Not the World sticks to the chummy indie playlist pop the band are so good at. Earnest, lovestruck singer Murph (Matthew Murphy) is front and centre of a shiny stew of easily digestible influences. Everything sounds vaguely like something else, without directly plagiarising anyone, although I thought “U2 at the club” more often than I wanted to. As the song titles warn, the general mood is perky self-help by way of repurposed cliches such as Work Is Easy, Life Is Hard, or stalker anthem If You Ever Leave, I’m Coming With You. The best tracks were released last year: Ready for the High is a deliciously weird cut-and-shut, and Method to the Madness has a lovely collapsed feeling. Mostly the album settles for sprightly mediocrity, and is often quite pleasurable, if you define pleasure as the absence of pain.

1/9/2022,"Reading Xochitl Gonzalez’s opening meditation on how wedding napkins signify wealth in the US, my heart sank. I need not have worried. Gonzalez is interested in far more than domestic one-upmanship and Olga Dies Dreaming is a multilayered debut about identity, race, the power of elites and the marginalisation of the poor. Two Nuyorican siblings, Olga, a successful wedding planner, and Prieto, a congressman, come up against a corrupt and hostile system in their pursuit of the American dream. Olga yearns to be the “Puerto Rican Martha Stewart”, but becomes disillusioned by the relentless drive to accumulate wealth and “its phantom cousin… fame”. Prieto enters politics determined to protect his Brooklyn neighbourhood and its minority community but, as Gonzalez implies, is successful because “he was handsome and eloquent… the perfect salve for White Guilt”. Politically naive, nicknamed “Pollyanna” by his peers, Prieto finds himself blackmailed by property developers intent on gentrifying the area.  Brought up by their grandmother and protective of each other, the pair are burdened by their parents’ mistakes. They continue to seek the approval of their activist mother, who abandoned Olga when she was 12 (and Prieto not much older), to fight for self-determination for Puerto Rico. Not long after, their father died of Aids, a junkie traumatised by the Vietnam war and unwilling to match his wife’s militancy. Puerto Rico, a US territory since 1898, has limited representation in Washington and various natural disasters have added to its financial woes. In 2017, Hurricane Maria devastated the island. The humanitarian crisis and the US’s shocking failure to provide adequate relief for its citizens lie at the heart of Gonzalez’s damning indictment of a world where the value of linen is prized more highly than compassion. The author cloaks her polemic in page-turning prose. This deeply satisfying and nuanced novel shines a light on political corruption and the limits of capitalism. It’s also a study of the psychological fallout of poor parenting and a tender exploration of love in its many forms. Olga Dies Dreaming by Xochitl Gonzalez is published by Fleet (£16.99).

1/9/2022,"Dr Nate Zinsser, a top US army psychologist renowned for helping lieutenants and officers build their confidence, is giving me a talking-to. We’ve been discussing highly disciplined writers who sit at their desks at 9am each day, no matter the circumstances, and assertively punch out stories. “I definitely don’t do that,” I say, remarking that I envy their confidence to sit and deliver. An aggressive perfectionist streak combined with niggling impostor syndrome insecurities mean I need conditions to be just-so in order to have faith that I’ll produce anything decent. Zinsser blanches. “The statement ‘I don’t do that’ is a decision you’re making about yourself,” he says, speaking over video call from his office at the US Military Academy in upstate New York; behind him there’s a whiteboard, ornamental Japanese swords and photos of athletes he’s counselled, including the Olympic-medal-winning US men’s bobsled team. “A constructive shift in your thinking would be the idea that, ‘Whether or not I got the right amount of sleep the night before or had a good breakfast, once 9 o’clock strikes, I am at my desk, lights on, ready to go – and I’m producing good stuff,’” he says. “That’s a belief about yourself that you can de-li-be-rate-ly cultivate,” he adds, stretching out each syllable in “deliberately” so there can be no question that in this matter, as in all self-confidence-related issues, change lies with me.  Delivered with a gentle assuredness, rather than barked across the screen, it’s not the tone you might expect from a man who for 27 years has directed the academy’s performance psychology programme. Indeed, the only thing about him that screams “army” is his black jacket, which has the word emblazoned in capitals across its front. With his snow-white beard and softly yawning New Jersey twang, the 67-year-old has a calm, almost paternalistic presence. His brand of optimism is far more reserved than the full-throttle enthusiasm often associated with self-help gurus. “We don’t live in a world of sunshine and lollipops,” as he puts it. “We live in a real world of deadlines, sweat, blisters and muscle fatigue, and we have to look at what is a constructive way to think in those situations.” In addition to his army duties, in his private practice Zinsser has worked with a glittering roster of clients, including neurosurgeons, congressional candidates, ballerinas, writers and star athletes, such as two-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Eli Manning. Whether their arena is the surgical table or the running track, they come to him for gamechanging advice on how to dispel those pesky naysaying voices in their head so that they can deliver knockout performances under pressure. And now he’s distilled his knowledge into a book, The Confident Mind: A Battle-Tested Guide to Unshakable Performance. I’m hoping to glean some tips from the famed confidence-whisperer. While hardly a quivering mess, I do have a habit of second-guessing myself in parts of my professional – and social – life. And the thought of public speaking sends me into a cold sweat. The chance to smooth out the chinks in my self-belief armour and come away with a quarterback’s swagger is tempting to say the least. But is it realistic? We tend to view confidence as a magical elixir that’s only available to Olympic sprinters, CEOs and other creatures blessed with rare talent, puffed-out chests and Colgate-white teeth (plus, the odd blustering buffoon). For most of us, being an adult means having a PhD in our multitude of shortcomings, foibles and crippling insecurities. And while I can improve my fitness with a Peloton, and my inner calm with meditation, surely I can’t just learn how to think highly of myself, can I? How to be unflappable under pressure? How to believe – with a surety that overrides any lingering doubts – that I can be good at anything? In his poised, methodical way, Zinsser is here to tell me that, if I doggedly commit to altering the story I tell myself about myself, then yes: yes I can. First, some housekeeping: Zinsser wants to straighten out some common misconceptions around confidence – starting with how we define it. Although we tend to think of it as a sense of belief in one’s own ability, he finds this unhelpful because it neglects a crucial fact: we are hardwired to perform skills unconsciously. When we’re in the zone – whether during a tennis match, maths exam or violin concerto – we’re not critically assessing each movement but operating in a free-flowing state. “If you’re hung up with the mechanics, and trying to think about what you’re doing as you’re doing it, you access a whole lot of neural pathways that tie you up,” he says. He defines confidence, then, as having “the sense of certainty about your ability that allows you to do something without thinking about it: that allows you to execute more or less unconsciously.” Being in this state makes success possible, not guaranteed. It won’t conceal a lack of ability, but it will enable you to go into a performance thinking: “I’ve got this money in my wallet and now I can spend it – let’s see if I’ve got enough,” he says. Without confidence, we’ll never know how good – how talented, how skilled – an individual really is. Zinsser doesn’t particularly see confidence as a product of genetics. Nor is it necessarily linked to competence. Sure, we idolise superstar athletes whose talent and bravado seem to go hand-in-hand, but he comes across just as many gifted people lacking self-belief. “The unfortunate fact I have seen is that our actual competence is higher than our degree of confidence in it,” he says, speaking about the population generally. “It’s the conclusion you draw about yourself from experiences of success [that breeds confidence],” he says. “Unless you make those conclusions, the actual success that you have might not do you any good.” He believes confidence is cultivated during childhood – “how you were encouraged as a young person to think about yourself” – and cites as an example King Richard, the recent biopic showing Richard Williams constantly telling his daughters Serena and Venus that they were destined to become the world’s best tennis players. Can anyone become more confident or is it only attainable for certain individuals? He pauses for a few beats, chewing over his words. “I think it’s quite possible for anyone to develop a greater sense of certainty,” he says, eventually. “Some people might have to overcome more baggage from their past than others, but I’m quite a believer in that kind of human potential.” In any event, there’s no such thing as “a confident person”; it’s more that you’re confident in a particular skill or situation (and even within a skill, you’ll feel better about some things than others). Case in point: Eli Manning. The former NFL superstar, who twice led the New York Giants to Super Bowl triumphs, “was very confident in his ability to throw certain balls and reach certain defences, but he did not like to stand up and talk in front of a crowd,” says Zinsser. “I’m convinced that’s the case for all of us: I don’t think there’s anybody who’s confident across the board.” “Have you ever produced good work in suboptimal conditions?” asks Zinsser rhetorically. We’re back to helping me forge a bulletproof writing mindset. “I would think so,” he continues, “otherwise, you wouldn’t be in the job you’re in. So what you need to be reinforcing, a story that you need to tell yourself about yourself, is: ‘I work well, despite distractions. I work well, in almost any condition. My editor can count on me to deliver quality work, even when things are chaotic around me.’” This rather simple reframing of how I view myself feels pretty significant. And I put it into immediate practice: in a meta situation, I’m writing this article from a cramped plane seat en route to Australia, a series of pre-flight texts from my editor demanding reassurance that I will be able to deliver words by the deadline still warming my phone. With each blood-curdling wail from a baby in a nearby bassinet, I repeat my new mantra about myself with an increasingly feverish vigour. Yet there’s much more to be done. Zinsser likens confidence to a mental “bank account” that we must constantly top up with valuable deposits. That includes mining our memories for instances of when we have done things well. After each training session, or day at work, we should devote about five minutes to reflecting on things we have accomplished and committing them to our “internal hard drive”. No victory is too small for inclusion. (He also notes that it’s worth spending time looking ahead and envisioning, in realistic HD-film quality, the dreams you most desire.) This can apply to whatever knee-knocking situation is keeping you up. Plagued with impostor-syndrome thoughts of not being qualified to do your job? “I’d tell you to give me the whole of your résumé,” says Zinsser. “We’re so good at overlooking the skills that we have cultivated, the effort that we have put in to develop ourselves to the point where we are indeed employable and competent. Look for some of the reasons that you are indeed the genuine person for the job.” His book contains countless tactics for keeping that bank account fat by recasting how you think about your missteps. Some are sourced from Martin Seligman, the father of “positive psychology”. These acknowledge that you will have negative thoughts and will make mistakes, but you can effectively see them off by viewing them as “temporary (“It’s just this one time”), limited (“It’s just in this one place”) and non-representative (“that’s not the truth about me”). There are physical techniques, too: keeping your shoulders slightly back and eyes straight ahead will improve your posture, while focusing on breathing during a performance can be a powerful way to bring a feeling of control and yank you into the present moment. (Note that none of these require you to obnoxiously strut about like The Wolf of Wall Street.) The most extreme example of selective thinking, the “shooter’s mentality” pursued by Golden State Warriors basketballer Stephen Curry, involves treating missed shots as temporary and as an omen that you’re about to experience a return to fortune (“I’m bound to make the next one”), while viewing successes as permanent (“Now I’m on a roll”). One nagging thought I had while reading these passages: building confidence often requires you to ignore logic. This took me back to the late 2000s when, as a tennis-obsessed teen who travelled around Australia competing in tournaments, my on-court confidence was fragile at best. If my warmup went badly, I was convinced the whole match would be a disaster. And I couldn’t get my head into the game if I had assessed, pre-encounter, that my opponent was better than me – smoother technique, bigger shots, flashy overseas academy training. In those instances, I was defeated before the match started. As often happens when we enter a situation devoid of confidence, it became a self-fulling prophecy. If someone had told me about the shooter’s mentality, which Zinsser calls a “thermonuclear psychological weapon”, I would’ve said: “Great, but how am I actually meant to believe these things?” To cast aside all reason and buy into a fantasyland where errors lead to success and success also leads to success? If I’m being honest it sounds slightly delusional, I tell Zinsser now. It is, he replies. But the way to wholeheartedly believe in it is to practise it, repeating these mantras, memories and mental tricks until the story they tell becomes “your dominant way of thinking about yourself in that context”, he says. “It’s got to become your dominant habit of thinking about yourself – just like you brush your teeth every morning and night – if you want it to materialise in a challenging atmosphere. You can’t just turn it on. It has to be already in you.” He can’t say how long this could take: for some clients it’s happened after only a few sessions, while for others it has taken six months of conscientious observance before it became endemic to their thinking. In case confidence wasn’t slippery enough, once you have gained it, the struggle continues. “We’re all imperfect beings and, no matter how many times you practise that second serve, occasionally you’re going to mess it up,” says Zinsser. Confidence is more delicate than a handblown vase. Acquiring some of it “doesn’t mean you’re going to have it for ever. It can easily be knocked down. You’re going to have to wake up again tomorrow and rebuild it.” Talk of confidence has been around for as long as humans have been going into battle. Zinsser’s book opens with a quote from the legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu who, in his fifth-century BC treatise The Art of War, declared: “Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.” Yet now, perhaps more than ever, individuals need to embrace self-assured thinking. Modern society is, at best, “very ambivalent” about confidence and is not about to puff us up, says Zinsser. Growing up, we’re taught that a soupçon of it is good; any more and we risk becoming smug or arrogant and therefore unlikable. Zinsser believes the biggest hurdle to striving for greater confidence is “the misguided impression that if I become certain about myself, I will somehow become lazy and complacent and I will lose my fire and motivation to improve,” he says. “Boy, is that a big misconception.” As part of our education and socialisation, we’re taught to focus on fixing imperfections and mistakes, marking every facet of our lives with red pens. “There is a curious tendency in our modern world to over-identify with our shortcomings and even define ourselves by our mistakes, presumed limitations, and all the things we can’t yet do,” writes Zinsser. While he admits that there’s a time for being a harsh critic, “there’s also just as much value in being one’s best friend”. Social media hasn’t helped the cause. “The 24/7, nonstop barrage of messages are always putting these somewhat false images in front of us: ‘Look at me, at this place, enjoying this wonderful day and this fabulous drink,” he says. “It tends to make us think, ‘Well, gee, I’m not in a beautiful location with a beautiful someone enjoying a beautiful drink. What’s wrong with me?’” Are we less confident than previous generations? There’s another long, reflective pause from Zinsser. In the 1950s and 1960s, he says, “There was a whole generation or two of folks who really grew up believing, ‘Things can be better, I can have a great life, I can succeed. Today, with the generation that’s grown up online, I’m not sure there’s the same general level of optimism,” he says. “My sense is that maybe we’re not quite as confident and optimistic now.” All the more reason to get to work on that movie about your life in which you’re the charming protagonist who completes everything – real feats from your past and wishlist goals alike – at a remarkable level. It takes dedication to stream this flick in your mind each night, sure, but it makes all that other hard work you’ve done – the backhand drills, the weekend reading, the university degrees, the blood and sweat – worthwhile by putting your head in the game come crunch time. Zinsser calls it the cherry on top. “It’s the decision to say: ‘I’ve done the work. I know what I know. I’m going to deliver now. I am enough.’” The Confident Mind: A Battle-Tested Guide to Unshakable Performance by Dr Nate Zinsser is published on 27 January by Cornerstone Press at £14.99.

1/9/2022,"When I was in Edinburgh last year, I asked around for chocolate recommendations and universal was the name Chocolate Tree. I had heard legendary stories about the ‘best ever’ hot chocolate and ‘giant churros’ and, fuelled by greed, made my way to where the shop was meant to be. We looked, but it wasn’t there, only discovering later that it had sold up and moved out East Lothian way and there was no Chocolate Tree shop front any more. A really good hot chocolate I could easily replicate at home, but I felt bitterly cheated by the lack of giant churros. Back home in England, I decided to order some Chocolate Tree merchandise. They do a great array of chocolate, from bars and boxes to spreads to dip-your-hand-in packets of chocolate-covered nuts and things, plus the aforementioned hot chocolate.  I decided on a nut theme, selecting milk chocolate-covered almonds (£7.95, 200g), which were excellent and have become a daily staple, but had the almonds been blanched first they would have been even more excellent. I chose a dark chocolate coffee and hazelnut bar (£3.95, 100g), which ended up being my favourite – a lovely mix of what’s a quite unusual flavour combo with added cocoa nibs for crunch. The dairy-free gianduja (£5.95, 80g) was glorious, too. Just four ingredients, but the hazelnuts made it so creamy I had to constantly recheck the label for milk.

1/9/2022,"British businesses are paying substantially more to produce carbon dioxide than their EU rivals because of the government’s refusal to link the UK carbon market to the bigger European market after Brexit. The difference is putting UK industry at a significant competitive disadvantage to European rivals, at a time of soaring energy prices, but does not result in any additional benefit to the environment.  UK companies are paying more than £75 a tonne for the carbon they emit, while similar industries in the EU are paying up to about €85 a tonne. The difference has narrowed slightly in recent days, but was reaching about €8-9 a tonne of carbon in the past month, equating to a premium of about 10% being paid by UK companies. Britain’s carbon price is higher because the UK carbon market, set up last year with the first permit auctions taking place last May, is much smaller and lacks the liquidity of the larger EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) that has been operating since 2005 and covers all of the EU’s heavy industries. Under both schemes, companies buy tradeable permits to cover the carbon dioxide they produce, with cleaner companies able to sell spares to laggards. The price acts as an incentive to companies to clean up their operations, and is seen as an economically efficient way to help meet the net zero emissions target. Ministers have a short window in which to reduce UK carbon prices before 18 January, the deadline for the government to release extra permits on to the market, which could reduce some of the price pressure. But experts said linking to the EU market would provide a better long-term answer, and make economic and environmental sense. Tom Lord, the head of trading at Redshaw Advisors, said: “UK companies are paying substantially more than they are in the EU. The big problem for the UK market is liquidity, and the fact that it is new. The EU has a historic surplus [of permits] to fall back on, but the UK has pent-up demand and only a drip-feed of supply.” Lawson Steele, joint head of carbon and utilities research at Berenberg bank, said: “This is a disadvantage [to UK companies]. The reality is that the UK carbon market is dwarfed by the EU ETS. Given that the UK wants to trade with the EU, and the EU wants to trade with the UK, it would make sense for companies to be on the same carbon footing.” British companies already paid higher prices for energy than their EU counterparts, amounting to about £35 a megawatt hour more, added Joe Morris, of UK Steel, which represents the steel industry. “This is a long-running bugbear for the steel sector, and something that continues to hamper our international competitiveness,” he said. The effect of both higher carbon prices and higher energy prices than the EU, as well as the lack of a post-Brexit deal with the US, which recently dropped its tariffs on EU steel, was to deter investment, he said. “This affects the competitiveness of steel companies, which links to investment in these companies. It affects our members’ confidence, and does not help people who work in the sector.” Steel companies were firmly behind the net zero strategy, Morris added, seeing the push for decarbonisation as offering a competitive advantage. “There’s an opportunity to be world-leading in green steel and net zero steel,” he said. Politicians tempted by high energy prices to dismantle net zero policies were mistaken, added Berenberg’s Steele. “Blaming the carbon price is baloney. Increasing energy prices in the last year have been 85% due to the gas price. Carbon is not the problem,” he said. The government has not explained why it has so far rejected a link with the EU system, but many suspect it is part of the desire for a “clean break” hard Brexit, maintaining as few regulatory links as possible. The Liberal Democrats and the Green party called on the government to link the UK ETS to the EU system. If the EU agreed, linking could probably be achieved fairly easily, as the UK system is modelled on the EU market, which the UK was a core part of and took a leading role in designing and updating while an EU member. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said: “The UK needs ambitious climate policies, but they will always be better if we work together with international partners. The Conservatives’ failure to do this is now hitting British business at the worst possible time, as energy-intensive firms are struggling with sky-high gas prices.” Molly Scott Cato, of the Green party, said: “It’s clearly irrational, inefficient and the result of the destructive Brexit ideology to try to run an independent UK carbon trading system with all its additional costs, inevitable inconsistencies and opportunities for gaming the market.” For years, after the 2008 financial crisis, the EU’s carbon market suffered a glut of permits and was largely ineffective, as the carbon price crashed. In recent years, however, reforms and the renewed need to slash emissions have pushed up prices and it is now working as intended, spurring investment in low-carbon technologies. Ministers have no plans to seek a link with the EU ETS, but are understood not to have ruled out the possibility entirely. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “The UK ETS Authority is considering whether to take any appropriate action under the cost containment mechanism [to release more permits on the market] and will announce its decision no later than 18 January to provide certainty to the market.”",News/Environment,Brexit decision left UK firms paying 10% more than EU rivals for emissions,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/09/brexit-decision-left-uk-firms-paying-10-more-than-eu-rivals-for-emissions
1/9/2022,"When the siege of Sarajevo began in 1992, Ratko Mladić’s Bosnian Serb army took up positions in the mountains surrounding the city. For his headquarters, Mladić chose Hotel Igman, a breathtaking piece of brutalist architecture that was the jewel of the 1984 Winter Olympics. The hotel was part of the Olympic village, a base for ski jumpers and alpine skiers, but Mladić – now serving a life sentence for genocide and crimes against humanity – used it to oversee the shelling of the city and his enemies used it as a prison and execution site. During the four years of the war, the hotel was blasted and bombed, and since the fighting stopped it has lain derelict, ignored by everyone except graffiti artists and the occasional tourist.  Now, as the 30th anniversary of the siege approaches, the hotel is set to be restored to its former Olympic glory. Hotel Igman was sold last week, at the 13th attempt, by the Sarajevo authorities. The new owners, who include former Bosnia-Herzegovina international footballer Emir Granov, paid 5.1m Bosnian marks (£2.2m). Granov told local media that they will spend a further £6m on renovations, in the hope that tourists choose Sarajevo as a new destination. One of Granov’s first decisions will be to consider a proposal from a rival bidder, Dimitri Hegemann, the owner of Berlin’s Tresor nightclub, to include a music venue in the refurbishment. “I wanted to turn it into a cultural lighthouse,” Hegemann said. “It should be a place where people can overcome ethnic differences – it is a special place with a special power. But I don’t have to own it.” The hotel had 162 rooms and a cinema that Hegemann believes would make a perfect venue, and create the same conditions as clubs such as Berlin’s Tresor and Berghain, which were created after the fall of the Berlin Wall and provided a place for young people from West Germany to mix with their eastern bloc counterparts. Such a club would bring tourists to Sarajevo, Hegemann believes, and he has interest from international DJs such as Jeff Mills and Mark Reeder to create an outdoor festival this summer among the ruins of the ski jumps in the hillside forests. “The problem is that the young creative people from the region are emigrating. They feel they have no future there and no space to test themselves and experiment,” said Hegemann. Sarajevo has not prospered since the Dayton peace accords ended the war in 1995, and there are few cultural landmarks left. The Skenderija centre, where Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean won gold in the figure skating for Great Britain, was renovated in 1999 after sustaining light damage during the war and includes a concert venue, but there is now talk of selling it. About half a million people are estimated to have left Bosnia-Herzegovina in the past six years, and a survey by the United Nations in November found that nearly half of the country’s under 30s are considering emigrating. Christian Schmidt, the UN high representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina, warned last year that the country was in danger of breaking apart, with the Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik threatening to create a new army. The US imposed sanctions on Dodik last week, and the EU has 700 soldiers from its Eufor peacekeeping force stationed in the country. Edin Forto, the prime minister of the Sarajevo canton, one of the country’s 10 regions, is desperate to bring investment to revive the city’s fortunes. Granov and his backers opened another hotel on Mount Igman in 2020, and Forto is pleased the Igman hotel has finally been sold to a decent investor. But he believes Hegemann’s plans are important for Sarajevo. “We aren’t going to be the new Berlin but we can be the old Sarajevo, because it was a cultural hub in the 80s,” he said. “Everyone wanted to come here and work here and create theatre, music, the film industry. There was a buzz. Why can’t we just recreate this energy?” Sarajevo used to be the centre of rock and pop music, but that has ebbed away, he said. “It seems like people in the villages won the war. Urban culture is dying. Now the most popular thing here is turbo-folk. I think it’s disgusting. We were the hub of urban popular culture and now we’re the hub of nothing. Now we import culture from Serbia and not the best kind. I don’t want to sound pessimistic – I’m in politics to change things. But we need allies.”",News/World news,Restoring hope: ‘Why can’t we recreate the old energy of Sarajevo?’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/09/restoring-hope-why-cant-we-recreate-the-old-energy-of-sarajevo
1/9/2022,"In Italy, it is now obligatory for people aged 50 or over to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Greece is pondering a similar move. In France, which has seen record numbers of positive cases, President Emmanuel Macron has also announced that he wants to “piss off” the unvaccinated, while Austria is contemplating a law to make the vaccine mandatory for all its citizens. By contrast, in the UK, Boris Johnson has confined himself to accusing anti-vaxxers of talking “mumbo-jumbo”. But is that enough? Should the UK take a harder line on those who refuse to be vaccinated? After all, this is a virus that threatens to overwhelm the NHS. As doctors continue to point out, hospital beds are now filling up with more and more seriously ill Covid patients, many of whom are unvaccinated. So, should vaccines against Covid be made mandatory, not just in certain workplace settings but for all individuals?  What is the case for making Covid vaccines mandatory? Most British scientists believe that increasing numbers of vaccinated people will give a major boost to efforts to limit hospitalisations from serious Covid complications. However, many question the wisdom of doing this by making vaccination mandatory. The issue is summed up by vaccine expert Peter English. “Unvaccinated people are very much more likely to become ill and consume disproportionate healthcare resources. A single case of Covid-19 requiring admission to an ICU can block a bed that could be used for many critical operations,” he told the Observer. “However, the backlash that could occur as a result of compulsory vaccination – which is not part of our culture, unlike in Italy – might mean even fewer people coming forward for vaccination, so it is not something that I would recommend.” What vaccines are mandatory in the UK? The answer to this is straightforward, said child health expert, Professor Helen Bedford of University College London. “We don’t mandate any vaccine in the UK. We recommend that people have certain vaccines and advise parents to have their children vaccinated against particular diseases but we do not enforce that in law. In fact, the only vaccine we have ever mandated in Britain was smallpox and the legislation enforcing its use was repealed in the 1940s. “Other countries have more of a tradition for mandatory vaccinations, however. For example, Italy now has a total of 10 vaccines that are mandatory.” What has been the impact of the Omicron variant, which is easier to catch but is thought to be less likely to cause serious illness? This is a key question, said psychologist Marie Juanchich of Essex University. “I believe Omicron is changing things. People feel a bit safer with it. It may spread really rapidly but its severity is perceived to be lower. People are much more concerned about the severity of an illness and less concerned about the infectiousness of the virus that causes it.” This point is backed by psychologist Simon Williams, at Swansea University. “There is now a widespread perception that Omicron is milder and I think a lot of people have taken that to mean they don’t have to worry about it and are not adjusting their behaviour.,” he said. A particular problem was the take-up of the booster vaccine last month, which was helped by the public’s wish not to disrupt the festive season with the virus. The fact that this risk has passed might have removed some of the drive to take up the vaccine, Williams added. “One of the things we have come across is a factor we call ‘variant fatigue’, which translates as people saying: ‘Oh, here we go again, a new variant. This is what viruses do; we just need to get on with our lives.’ That’s not great from a public health perspective.” So how should we improve Covid-19 vaccination rates? An important issue is to differentiate between a diehard anti-vaxxer and someone who has nagging doubts about getting a vaccine, said Bedford. “If you lump them together, you will miss the chance to persuade those who have genuine concerns but who could change their minds and get vaccinated. “We need to get to the people in this latter category although that takes time and resources. Some GPs have been ringing up all their unvaccinated patients to have a chat and that has proven to be effective. However, it is hard work. Nor does it have to be a doctor, it might be a religious leader or community leader. “Certainly, from my own experience, I find that if you actually sit down with a doubter, listen to what their concern is, and respond appropriately, very often, you can encourage them to be vaccinated. Certainly, I don’t think we should be thinking about mandating or making a vaccine compulsory.”",News/Society,Coronavirus: should the UK make vaccination mandatory?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/09/coronavirus-should-the-uk-make-vaccination-mandatory
1/9/2022,"When Shreena Shah went to check on one of her rental properties, she says she was greeted by an unlikely scene – a man dismantling equipment used to produce cannabis. It was not the first shock she had to endure. Shortly before, the police had discovered a cannabis farm in the other rental property she and her family own.  Now, she says, she faces bills mounting to £150,000 for repairs, and the letting agent has been accused of negligence by the family. The case comes amid concern about the lack of regulation in the property sector, despite a government consultation which recommended tightening rules two years ago. The properties, in different London boroughs, were used to cultivate drugs but, the family says, they had been unable to get any enforcement agency to help them. “The house and flat were pretty much destroyed in starkly similar circumstances, and I’ve been shocked at how little recourse I have,” says Shah. “We have been left financially devastated and no authority has been willing to investigate.” Shah says she and her family usually manage the rentals themselves once their letting agent finds suitable tenants, but, when their tenants moved out in 2019, the agency, ABC Estates, offered to take over the management of both properties for no extra charge. Shah says that she was told that both sets of new tenants had had bruising experiences with landlords, and wanted the agent to collect the rent and carry out maintenance and inspections. She claims that, despite repeated requests, she was only sent the signed tenancy agreements and tenant references for both properties in January 2021, 18 months after the first tenants moved in. “It appeared that ABC had done barely any checks on the tenants,” she says. In summer 2020, Shah claims that ABC Estates notified her that the tenants in the house were leaving, and paying rent in lieu of notice. Shah inspected it with the agent and found it in good order. “A couple of weeks later, I was told that the same tenants wanted to come back and I agreed,” she says. The first cannabis farm was discovered by police at the house last November after concerns were raised by a neighbour. “Concerned for the second property, I immediately went round and found a man dismantling cannabis equipment,” she says. Shah claims that ABC Estates acted negligently in failing to safeguard her properties, an allegation the company denies. Her experience appears to show the lack of protections for purchasers and vendors in an unregulated property sector. Two years after a government-appointed working group recommended a mandatory licensing scheme for estate agents and an industry regulator with enforcement powers, there has been no word on reform. Estates agents do not have to have qualifications, despite handling life-changing sums of money and assets on behalf of clients. The only requirement is that they are signed up to a redress scheme that can mediate in individual disputes with clients. Local trading standards teams are responsible for investigating if an agent is in breach of the Estate Agents Act 1979, and the National Trading Standards Estate and Letting Agency Team (NTSELAT) can prohibit an agent from trading if breaches are serious. However, redress schemes have limited enforcement powers, and complaints can take more than six months to be heard, while years of under resourcing appear to have left trading standards ill-equipped to take action. Moreover, all three bodies can only react to individual complaints, rather than proactively vet agents to minimise the risk of potential misconduct. Shah escalated her complaint against ABC Estates to the Property Redress Scheme (PRS), a government-authorised service which considers consumer complaints about property issues. It told her that her allegations were beyond its remit as they involved the cannabis farm and were of a criminal nature, and referred her to trading standards. Her local trading standards department told her that since the properties were in two different local authority areas, it could not help and claimed it was a matter for the police. The Metropolitan police declared that it would not be possible to identify the cannabis growers and that her complaint was therefore a civil issue. When she contacted NTSELAT she was referred back to her local trading standards department. ABC Estates – which is registered with Companies House as Aldermartin Ltd – has three offices in London and was featured in daily adverts on LBC talk radio in the past, including a video endorsement by presenter Nick Ferrari. The agency insists it had no knowledge of the cannabis production at the two properties it managed. Documents seen by the Observer appear to raise questions about the agent’s procedures. The employment reference that it obtained for one tenant stated that she worked for a company that currently has the same director as ABC Estates. Rental payments for both properties were made in cash to ABC Estates, which, Shah says, suggest to her that it had not sought bank details for either party. ABC Estates is one of a string of similarly named property companies established over the years by Richard (Raziel) Davidoff. In August, a first-tier tribunal (property chamber) concluded that Davidoff had breached his fiduciary duty after overcharging leaseholders in a block managed by ABC Estates for repair work that was not carried out. Investigators found that he had charged nearly £100,000 for works that had been estimated at £10,000, and transferred service charges and reserve fund money into the account of a dormant company he owned. It disputes the tribunal ruling. In a statement in November, Davidoff told the Observer: “Many of the facts as you portray them are distorted. The clients clearly have not advised you that after a whole year, they asked the tenant to leave, and at the checkout they found the property was in immaculate condition. “They then allowed the tenant to move back in a short while later, thereafter the property was found to be a cannabis farm. We cannot be held responsible for that. We were as shocked as they were, and we do not condone such behaviour.” In the autumn questions about Davidoff’s record as a managing agent for leasehold properties were raised in parliament by Sir Peter Bottomley. Bottomley, who is co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on leasehold and commonhold reform, urged the government to heed whistleblower allegations from former staff of ABC Estates, and called for urgent regulatory reform of property agents. He told the Observer: “Police and trading standards must work effectively together to avoid exploitation of a fragmented system which does not work.” The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told the Observer that it was considering the recommendations of the 2019 working group report. A spokesperson for Nick Ferrari said: “These adverts were filmed more than five years ago in a standard commercial agreement. These are serious allegations and Nick will seek ways of having the adverts removed.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Landlord faces £150,000 bill after tenants turn homes into drug farm",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/09/landlord-faces-150000-bill-after-tenants-turn-homes-into-drug-farm
1/9/2022,"More and more people around the world are suffering because their immune systems can no longer tell the difference between healthy cells and invading micro-organisms. Disease defences that once protected them are instead attacking their tissue and organs. Major international research efforts are being made to fight this trend – including an initiative at London’s Francis Crick Institute, where two world experts, James Lee and Carola Vinuesa, have set up separate research groups to help pinpoint the precise causes of autoimmune disease, as these conditions are known.  “Numbers of autoimmune cases began to increase about 40 years ago in the west,” Lee told the Observer. “However, we are now seeing some emerge in countries that never had such diseases before. For example, the biggest recent increase in inflammatory bowel disease cases has been in the Middle East and east Asia. Before that they had hardly seen the disease.” Autoimmune diseases range from type 1 diabetes to rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis. In each case, the immune system gets its wires crossed and turns on healthy tissue instead of infectious agents. In the UK alone, at least 4 million people have developed such conditions, with some individuals suffering more than one. Internationally, it is now estimated that cases of autoimmune diseases are rising by between 3% and 9% a year. Most scientists believe environmental factors play a key role in this rise. “Human genetics hasn’t altered over the past few decades,” said Lee, who was previously based at Cambridge University. “So something must be changing in the outside world in a way that is increasing our predisposition to autoimmune disease.” This idea was backed by Vinuesa, who was previously based at the Australian National University. She pointed to changes in diet that were occurring as more and more countries adopted western-style diets and people bought more fast food. “Fast-food diets lack certain important ingredients, such as fibre, and evidence suggests this alteration affects a person’s microbiome – the collection of micro-organisms that we have in our gut and which play a key role in controlling various bodily functions,” Vinuesa said. “These changes in our microbiomes are then triggering autoimmune diseases, of which more than 100 types have now been discovered.” Both scientists stressed that individual susceptibilities were involved in contracting such illnesses, ailments that also include celiac disease as well as lupus, which triggers inflammation and swelling and can cause damage to various organs, including the heart. “If you don’t have a certain genetic susceptibility, you won’t necessarily get an autoimmune disease, no matter how many Big Macs you eat,” said Vinuesa. “There is not a lot we can do to halt the global spread of fast-food franchises. So instead, we are trying to understand the fundamental genetic mechanisms that underpin autoimmune diseases and make some people susceptible but others not. We want to tackle the issue at that level.” This task is possible thanks to the development of techniques that now allow scientists to pinpoint tiny DNA differences among large numbers of individuals. In this way, it is possible to identify common genetic patterns among those suffering from an autoimmune disease. “Until very recently, we just didn’t have the tools to do that, but now we have this incredible power to sequence DNA on a large scale and that has changed everything,” said Lee. “When I started doing research, we knew about half a dozen DNA variants that were involved in triggering inflammatory bowel disease. Now we know of more than 250.” Such work lies at the core of Lee and Vinuesa’s efforts, which aim to find out how these different genetic pathways operate and unravel the many different types of disease doctors are now looking at. “If you look at some autoimmune diseases – for example, lupus – it has become clear recently there are many different versions of them, that may be caused by different genetic pathways,” said Vinuesa. “And that has a consequence when you are trying to find the right treatment. “We have lots of potentially useful new therapies that are being developed all the time, but we don’t know which patients to give them to, because we now realise we don’t know exactly which version of the disease they have. And that is now a key goal for autoimmune research. We have to learn how to group and stratify patients so we can give them the right therapy.” Lee also stressed that surging cases of autoimmune diseases across the world meant new treatments and drugs were now urgently needed more than ever before. “At present, there are no cures for autoimmune diseases, which usually develop in young people – while they are trying to complete their education, get their first job and have families,” he said. “That means growing numbers of people face surgery or will have to have regular injections for the rest of their lives. It can be grim for patients and a massive strain on health services. Hence the urgent need to find new, effective treatments.”",News/Science,Global spread of autoimmune disease blamed on western diet,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/08/global-spread-of-autoimmune-disease-blamed-on-western-diet
1/9/2022,"Last summer, I visited a facility run by the Office for National Statistics, a place in which the raw material of history was in the final stages of being made ready for public release. The centre of operations was a large, open-plan office, one half dominated by tall metal racks on which hundreds of large boxes were stored, the other filled with rows of desks on which digital scanning equipment had been set up. There the 1921 census for England and Wales, all 38m entries, held in 30,000 bound ledgers, was being digitised and conserved. My visit took place in the final, scaled-back weeks of a colossal process that had begun three years earlier. The team from the genealogy company Findmypast and the National Archives had almost finished their work and there was a palpable sense of anticipation. Last week, the fruits of those three years’ work were released.  The publication of a census is a once-in-a-decade event. After each census is taken, the millions of individual census returns are gathered together and the information within them analysed and condensed into national statistics, the metrics used by politicians to shape policy. But the census forms themselves, filled in by our ancestors, are closed to the public for 100 years. Those returns, the individual atoms of official data, have a significance and a meaning that goes far beyond national statistics. They are the intimate records of 8.5m individual households and that passage of a century, the span of three generations, means that a census bridges the gulf between history and memory. I learned this lesson during my visit to the ONS archives. The team involved in the digitisation had, very thoughtfully, laid out for me two pages from two census ledgers. They contained the entries made by two of my great-grandfathers. Listed on one was my grandfather, then a boy of 16, already apprenticed as an engineer, learning the skills that would carry on through a lifetime spent on industrial Tyneside, a life punctuated by war, booms and recessions. My grandmother, a girl of just 10 in 1921, was listed in the other ledger as living in a tiny house with her six siblings, some of whom I vaguely remember as old people, whom I was to meet more than half a century later. Some I never met as they did not survive their childhoods. Infant mortality is one of the many hard truths that rise from the pages of the 1921 census. Feeling emotions while investigating history is part of my day job, something I can usually (though not always) get through without weeping. That was not the case on this occasion. I have thought about my grandparents, and the north-east they knew as children and teenagers, more deeply than ever, having seen them recorded at the ages of 16 and 10 on the pages of the census. I have thought about what they had been through in the decades before I and their other grandchildren moved from Nigeria in the early 1970s, to live with them in the same Gateshead flat my grandfather was living in when the census form dropped through the letter box in the summer of 1921. For many families, what will be most poignant about the census of 1921 will not be the names listed in the neat columns on the left-hand side of each return form but the names that are missing from those pages – the boys and young men who appeared in the census of 1911 but who are missing 10 years later, on the other side of the rupture that was the Great War. Their names can be found on another census of sorts, inscribed on to the hundreds of thousands of Portland stone headstones and memorials to the missing that are today scattered across the former battlefields of France and Belgium, the work of what in the 1920s was known as the Imperial War Graves Commission. That census of the fallen also contains the names of many men who had been fathers to the 730,000 children listed as fatherless in 1921. While the 1921 census is a record of a moment of unique trauma, it arrives in the public domain at another fraught and disorienting point in British history, making it impossible not to draw comparisons between then and now. The nation of 1921, like that of 2022, was afflicted by a deep and socially corrosive housing crisis. Looking through their family returns many people will make the same calculation that I made when looking at the conditions in which my grandmother grew up. Divide the number of people in any household by the number of bedrooms and the housing crisis of 1921 becomes clear and manifest. Hardly the “fit country for heroes” promised by wartime leader David Lloyd George. But our age is horribly redolent of the postwar era in another way. In 1921, the nation had, just two years earlier, been through a third wave of the influenza pandemic that had begun in 1918. That pandemic claimed more lives globally than the war of 1914-18. In Britain, it sent another 228,000 people to their graves. Beyond what it tells us about housing, class, poverty and changing relations between the genders, what makes the release of the 1921 census especially significant is that for many of us it will be the last we see. In 10 years’ time, the archives will have nothing to say about life in England and Wales of 1931, as the census of that year was destroyed by fire in 1942, a mundane accident rather than an inferno caused by the Blitz. The census for Scotland survived and will be released. The census of spring of 1941, for obvious reasons, never took place. What this means is that after 2022 the next English and Welsh census to be released will be that of 1951, the year of the Festival of Britain and Winston Churchill’s return to Downing Street. Its release is due in January 2052.  David Olusoga is a historian and broadcaster",Opinion/Opinion,Time collapsed as I saw how my grandad lived a century ago.

1/9/2022,"Ugandan satirical novelist Kakwenza Rukirabashaija, who was named International Writer of Courage by PEN last year, has been illegally detained and tortured for criticising the president and his son, his lawyer said. Gunmen came to the writer’s house on 28 December after a series of tweets about the country’s president, Yoweri Museveni, including one calling him a thief and his son and presumed successor “an incompetent pig-headed curmudgeon”.  In his last tweet Rukirabashaija said he was under house arrest and the men were entering by force. He has not been able to contact his lawyers since then, and no charges have been brought. On Monday police took him with them to search the family’s country home. His wife was there and was horrified to see her husband weak, injured, limping and wearing bloodstained underwear. She said she saw wounds on his feet and he told her there were others on his buttocks, and that he had been deprived of food. “[He] told me he was starved, asked for what to eat, when I served him with a glass of milk, he retched it,” she said in an affidavit to court. His lawyer Kiiza Eron is demanding that the author is released, as under Ugandan law police can only detain people for 48 hours without charge. He has obtained a court order for Rukirabashaija’s release, but the authorities are ignoring it. “Police have admitted holding him, but they are not willing to allow us access... he has been incommunicado apart from the day of the search,” Eron said. A spokesman for the criminal investigations directorate (CID) said on Monday that the author was being held over “abusive” tweets from late December. Charles Twiine of the CID claimed an investigation was nearly complete and Rukirabashaija would be taken to court by Tuesday to face charges of “offensive communications”. But there have been no further comments from the government, and the author remains in jail without charge, despite growing international pressure. PEN America called for his urgent release. “Kakwenza Rukirabashaija is no stranger to the Ugandan authorities’ systematic suppression of dissident views, yet he has courageously continued to speak out,” said Karin Deutsch Karlekar, director of Free Expression at Risk programmes. “These rights violations demonstrate a vindictive abuse of the law and demonstrate the truth of many of the critiques Rukirabashaija himself is being targeted for making in his writing.”EU special representative for human rights Eamon Gilmore is among the diplomats who have raised their concerns. “I’m alarmed by reports of alleged torture and incommunicado detention of author Kakwenza Rukirabashaija. He remains in detention without trial, despite a court order for his unconditional release. I urge Ugandan authorities to uphold the rule of law and due process,” he said. Rukirabashaija is best known for his novel The Greedy Barbarian, which tackles corruption in a fictional country. He was arrested in April 2020 and held for seven days and tortured, then detained again in September of that year. He detailed that treatment in his latest work, Banana Republic: Where Writing Is Treasonous. “In Africa, when you write fiction, especially political fiction, such as the political allegory Animal Farm by George Orwell, the leaders will always think that one is writing about them,” Rukirabashaija wrote. “Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda, felt that it was him that I had written about and so he sent his hoodlums to arrest and torture me in order to hamper my creativity. The idea was to completely stop me from being creative.” Uganda is a key western ally in east Africa, and has received billions of dollars of development and security assistance from the UK and US. But Museveni faces pressure over human rights failings that have worsened in recent years, since he started to face significant political challenges. He claimed victory in elections last January, but they were marred by allegations of fraud and the harassment and illegal detention of opposition activists. Ugandan security services even held children for months in prisons, the Guardian discovered.
