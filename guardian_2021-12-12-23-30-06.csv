12/12/2021,"A bitter political row has erupted in Spain after a family in Catalonia was harassed and abused for seeking to ensure that a quarter of the lessons at the school their five-year-old son attends are taught in Spanish. The family’s actions have provoked an angry response from some Catalan nationalists who view their stance as an assault on the region’s language and culture.  According to media reports, the family became the subject of a WhatsApp group that has suggested identifying the child and his parents. One person tweeted that their house should be stoned, while another called for the little boy to be shunned, adding: “The other children should leave their class when lessons are taught in Spanish. If we don’t react, they’ll kill our language.” At the end of last week, the Catalan high court ordered the regional education ministry and the head of the school in the town of Canet de Mar to take measures to protect the boy and his identity. During a visit to the school last Thursday, Josep Gonzàlez-Cambray, who serves as education minister in the pro-independence regional government – said he condemned “any kind of threats or violence”. But he criticised the Catalan high court’s decision to order that 25% of classes be taught on Spanish as “an intolerable attack”, adding: “The Catalan school model is a model of success, which guarantees us social cohesion, equity and equal opportunities.” Fernando Grande-Marlaska, interior minister in Spain’s Socialist-led coalition government, has warned that “any threats to coexistence” will be investigated. Salvador Illa, a former central government minister who now leads the Catalan Socialist party, also criticised the attacks on the family and said schools need to obey the decisions made by courts. “This doesn’t go against Catalan; it’s about complying with rulings, and the [regional education system] still guarantees Catalan as the educational centre of gravity in Catalonia,” Illa said on Thursday. The Spanish right has seized on the episode as proof of anti-Spanish discrimination in Catalonia, where the separatist government attempted unilateral secession in 2017. Pablo Casado, the leader of the rightwing People’s party – which is leading the national polls but has just three MPs in the 135-seat Catalan parliament – said: “Today in Spain, we’re suffering a terrible case of linguistic segregation involving a five-year-old boy.” Casado said the Catalan government was practising “linguistic apartheid” and accused the Socialist-led minority government of “complicit silence” because it relies on the support of some Catalan nationalists in congress. The far-right Vox party, whose rise has been partly fuelled by the Catalan independence crisis, has called a demonstration outside the regional parliament on Tuesday evening. It said it would no longer allow “twisted separatism to continue assaulting the little boy and his family from Canet with total impunity”. Language issues have also featured in the central government’s efforts to get next year’s budget through parliament. Last month, the administration of Pedro Sánchez attempted to placate the Catalan Republican Left party – which heads the regional government – by proposing that at least 6% of streaming platforms’ content would have to be in Spain’s co-official languages: Catalan, Galician or Basque.

12/12/2021,"In one of Tel Aviv’s most affluent neighbourhoods, a collection of ramshackle one-storey homes with rusting roofs known as Givat Amal Bet still sits in the shadow of the new high-rise towers looming above. Israel’s economic centre has recently been named the world’s most expensive city to live in, overtaking Paris and Singapore in the 2021 rankings compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). As the Mediterranean city’s reputation as a global tech hub continues to attract foreign investment, however, and prices soar for goods and services as Israel’s economy recovers strongly from the pandemic, locals fear the widening gap between rich and poor is pushing out working-class residents and creating damaging new social divisions.  Tel Aviv’s status as the world’s most expensive metropolis, up from fifth last year, is in large part the result of global inflation and supply chain issues caused by Covid-19 shutdowns. The shekel has gone from strength to strength thanks to the weakened dollar, Israel’s large current account surplus and foreign direct investment in the tech sector that is expected to reach a whopping $30bn (£22.7bn) by the end of the year. Givat Amal Bet is the starkest example of the area’s changing demographics. During the 1947-48 war that surrounded the creation of the Israeli state, the residents of the Palestinian village of al-Jammasin al-Gharbi, which once stood there, fled to avoid the fighting. Newly-arrived Jewish refugees and immigrants from around the Middle East and North Africa, known as mizrahim, were asked to settle in their place as a buffer against the Arab armies. The displaced Palestinians were later denied the right to return, so the mizrahim stayed and named their new home Givat Amal Bet. Unlike other villages that were absorbed into the municipality as Tel Aviv grew, however, the 40 or so working-class families living there were never allowed to purchase the land on which their homes were built. Despite paying city taxes, they have only had irregular access to services such as water and electricity. The community is still fighting a decades-long legal battle for compensation with development companies, the state and the Tel Aviv municipality, but the last of the neighbourhood’s residents were forcibly evicted from their homes last month. “When my parents came from Damascus we were asked to settle here to help the state,” said Yossi Cohen, 68, who was dragged by police out of the house in which he was born in November. Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, “promised that we would be rewarded for that, that we would keep our homes”. Most of the contents of his home were dumped outside, and a fence now stops anyone from going in. “But we have fought discrimination from the Ashkenazi [Jews of European heritage] our whole lives. We live on some of the most expensive land in Tel Aviv, so they try force us off, the same way they do with the Arabs.” Two high-rise towers have been built on the edge of Givat Amal Bet since 2005. Three more are planned to meet the demand for office space and luxury apartments. The EIU’s assessment doesn’t even factor in Tel Aviv’s surging property prices and shortage of purchasable land, said Asaf Mualem, the owner of the real estate company Menivim Israel. “In the last two years our prices have become double what you see on shows like Selling Sunset in Los Angeles. We are talking 65,000 shekels [£16,000] per square metre,” he said. The foreign investment is coming from the tech sector, the Jewish diaspora in France and the US and a new influx of money from the UAE, Mualem said. The wealthy Gulf state, along with Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan, signed US-brokered peace agreements with Israel in 2019. ‘Even rich local people are getting priced out, and it’s not going to stop. I think prices will go up another 30% before the bubble bursts,” he said. Gentrification is a problem in cities across the world, but Israel’s recent political paralysis has compounded Tel Aviv’s housing crisis. No public housing has been built in the last two years, even though 30,000 people are on waiting lists. “Israel was founded as a socialist state, but we have abandoned those principles. I do more of a job finding vulnerable people places to live than the entire housing ministry,” said Riki Kohan Benlulu, a local activist. “They started selling off public housing in the 80s, which is when the gap started growing. Safety nets are the price of civilisation. Now it’s like going to hospital, but instead of giving you medicine, they make you sick.” Standing outside his former home in Givat Amal Bet, Cohen is not sure what the future holds for the neighbourhood or the residents’ association’s battle for compensation. “We have a saying in Hebrew, we talk about a land that eats its inhabitants. Well, the ones up there, they’re the ones who feed on us,” he said, pointing at the tower developments.",News/World news,Tel Aviv: poverty and eviction in the world’s most expensive city,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/tel-aviv-poverty-eviction-givat-amal-bet-gentrification-worlds-most-expensive-city
12/12/2021,"Pontus Jansson is wanted by Leicester, Newcastle and Everton in January after they were alerted to the Brentford captain’s contract situation. Jansson’s current deal expires at the end of the season, with Brentford understood to have an option to extend it by a year. Yet the 30-year-old Sweden defender’s outstanding performances this season have helped to guide the newly promoted side to a mid-table position, and it is understood that has not gone unnoticed by Brentford’s Premier League rivals.  Everton and Leicester are both keen to strengthen their defences, while Newcastle manager Eddie Howe is also desperate to reinforce his squad having also shown an interest in Burnley’s James Tarkowski, whose contract also expires at the end of the season. Brentford are likely to demand a hefty fee for Jansson, who has started all 16 of their Premier League matches this season and scored the equaliser in their stoppage-time comeback victory over Watford on Friday night. He was signed from Leeds in July 2019 for an undisclosed fee after falling out with their manager, Marcelo Bielsa. Before the meeting with his former side on 5 December, which ended in a 2-2 draw, Jansson described Brentford as “a smaller club than the other clubs I have played for”. “Malmö is a massive club, and then I went to Italy to Torino, which is also a big, big club, and Leeds, crazy big club. You couldn’t almost walk into the city because everyone is a Leeds fan,” he added. “And then you move here to a smaller club. I feel the difference now that we are in the Premier League, the interest in this club is much bigger than what it was in the Championship.”",Sport/Football,Brentford’s Pontus Jansson sought by trio of clubs with contract expiring,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/12/brentfords-pontus-jansson-sought-by-trio-of-clubs-with-contract-expiring
12/12/2021,"Services that look after the elderly and disabled at home are facing the worst crisis in memory, operators have warned, with hours of unmet care increasing more than fivefold since May to 1.5m. Vital visits to look after people with dementia and other disabilities are being denied amid rising demand – including families concerned about sending their loved ones to care homes during the pandemic – and staff shortages triggered by low pay and Brexit.  About half of domiciliary care providers are no longer able to take on new requests for help, according to the Homecare Association, and 85% of operators believe the situation is the hardest it has ever been. The charity Age UK has warned of the emergence of “care deserts”, a term more often applied to US healthcare shortages. The crisis threatens the welfare of some of the country’s most vulnerable people and puts pressure on NHS beds, as people who could be cared for in the community end up in hospital. Families told the Guardian that people feel imprisoned if carers are not available to take them outside, while their health is harmed because they forget to eat, drink and take medicine properly and on time. “Our strategy seems to be to neglect people in the community until they are in crisis, then blue-light them into hospital,” said Jane Towson, the chief executive of the Homecare Association. “Then it is the devil’s own job to get them out again because of a lack of capacity.” The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass) found that in the three months to the end of April, 286,000 hours of home care could not be delivered. By the end of October that number stood at over 1.5m hours. Councils have managed to increase the number of hours delivered by 20% over that period, but it has not been close to enough. “These are not numbers. these are people’s lives,” said Stephen Chandler, the president of Adass. “Every single one is a person who is missing out on vital support that enables them to live their lives. The government must take immediate steps to ensure that everyone gets the care and support they need this winter.” Margaret McCann, an 81-year-old with dementia living alone in Brighton, is among those caught in the crisis. In June she stopped eating, and forgot to drink and take medication, and a crisis care team from Age UK stepped in temporarily until, her family hoped, a homecare package from the local council could be arranged. Six months later the only professional care she receives is from the crisis team, which was supposed to stop after six weeks. “She has dementia and lives on her own, which is a massive worry,” said her daughter Sally McCann, who has a full-time job and a son aged 17. “She is basically on her own and is losing all her social contact. It breaks my heart. The emphasis is on keeping everyone at home, but they will just deteriorate unless there is help.” On a short visit last week, Margaret, who remains spritely at times, held hands with her carer Trevor Thew and told him: “I’m nearly 82 you know.” “What’s your secret?” he asked. “I’ve forgotten,” she said. “I’ll tell you next time you come.” Brighton and Hove city council said it has seen a fivefold increase in demand in the last year, with families increasingly reluctant to send loved ones into care homes. Brexit has hit providers’ attempts to find enough staff, it said. “Social care services, including home care, desperately need more government funding quickly if we are going to continue to fully meet the needs of our residents,” said Sue Shanks, chair of the council’s health and wellbeing board. In Salford, Charlie Pelham, 86, who is in a wheelchair after four spells in hospital this year, and Eric Griffiths, 57, who is registered deaf and blind, said they both need homecare packages but that they have either been unavailable or unsuitable, leaving them to fend for themselves. “Imagine me being blind, pushing a wheelchair,” said Griffiths. “I was crashing into bus stops and tipping him out into the road because I couldn’t see what I was doing … I get Charlie ready, and I’m doing all the shopping by myself, doing all the cooking and the cleaning. It’s really hard. But what can you do; it’s got to be done.” John Merry, of Salford city council, said: “There are challenges with the number of care workers. This is a national issue not unique to Salford, and we are working hard to bring in more service providers so there is enough resilience and capacity in care supply.” In Leicestershire, Deirdre Thomas, 68, helps look after her mother, Jean, but has been looking for evening care for six months. “She is 99 and pretty wobbly,” she said. “My heart is in my mouth. I am so terrified she will fall over, an ambulance won’t come and I will never see her again.” Urgent action is required “to even keep the system viable”, said Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK. “For older and disabled people the consequences of this crisis in care can be severe,” she said. The Department of Health and Social Care said: “Care homes and homecare providers are benefiting from hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in the social care workforce, including through a dedicated recruitment and retention fund … Covid-19 pressures are continuously kept under review and the need for further support will be assessed as we go through the winter period.”",News/Society,"Crisis in UK homecare services at worst point yet, say operators",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/12/homecare-services-crisis-uk-at-worst-point-yet-say-operators

12/12/2021,"“I’m not just trying to make things up. I genuinely believe that if we’d taken our chances better, and handled that first innings better, we could be sat here in a very different position.” It would be easy to disparage Joe Root’s post-Brisbane comments as obvious and not useful, but the England captain’s press conference was one of his stronger displays. Root’s media appearances can often be limp, conciliatory towards nothing in particular, couching each defeat in terms of lessons that England need to learn while leading a team that never learns them. In the Carl Rackemann Indoor Centre beneath the Gabba, next to the nets and the workout equipment, Root was exercised, punchy, obviously deeply frustrated with that opening Ashes loss.  He dismissed the criticism that he was wrong to bat first, and fairly so. Hindsight punditry is a hollow pursuit. Making an opponent bat last is almost always the best option, and getting through some tricky batting hours on day one is routinely the price required. The fact that England failed to do does not mean they were wrong to try. Root could not have known that the Australians would be spared the same conditions by the arrival of rain, nor that the following days would be sunny and fair when the forecast suggested otherwise. He would have been as frustrated with his own duck in that first innings as he was frustrated that nobody but Dawid Malan could contribute alongside him in England’s second. As for the angst about leaving out Stuart Broad, bowling selections don’t mean much when you’re out for 147 first. Broad monstered Australia’s opener David Warner in England in 2019, but he spent five Tests bowling to Warner in Australia in 2017-18 and didn’t get him once. Warner made 441 runs that series averaging 63. As Root pointed out, his bowlers this time created chances, but his team dropped catches, missed run-outs, and overstepped the front line. Where he was most staunch was in refusing to concede that England’s tour would now fall away. Defeats at the Gabba led to scorelines of 5-0 in 2006-07, 5-0 in 2013/14, and 4-0 in 2017-18, an overall scoreline of 15-3 in the last four Australian Ashes series. Having played in the last two of those defeats, he said that he was as conscious of the trend as he was determined to make sure that it would not repeat. Words are only words, but there is reason to believe that the current Australian team can be tackled. This is not a collection of proven champions in the manner of teams past. Warner will enter the Adelaide Test hampered by bruised ribs from a blow while batting. Steve Smith didn’t make a score in Brisbane. Marcus Harris, Travis Head and Alex Carey are all left-handers susceptible to nicking the ball. Cameron Green is young and yet to produce an influential Test innings. Start well, and pressure can be applied. While England have Broad and James Anderson to return to the team, having already got well under way on bowler rotation, Australia rely heavily on the main pace trio of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and captain Patrick Cummins. Hazlewood is likely to miss Adelaide with a minor muscle strain. Of the squad replacements, Michael Neser has never played a Test and Jhye Richardson played two, nearly three years ago. The principal problem for England on recent tours has been letting mid-tier players produce dominant performances in a manner far above their more modest overall achievements. The brothers Shaun and Mitchell Marsh made bulk runs in the previous Australian Ashes, wicketkeeper Brad Haddin did the same in the one before that - the most runs ever in a series by a player outside the top six. Head has already produced the first such display with his attacking 154 that all but sealed the match this week. Here is where England must tighten the screws until the thread squeaks. Which is not to say that Australia can’t boss the series from here. The quality is there for it to pan out that way, and the script of the Brisbane Test hit all of the right cues to set it up. England’s batting is weak and the fielding from those batters is just as bad. There are multiple players in England’s top six who would be recording negative scores in indoor cricket. There is an indoor centre in Toowoomba that also used to bear Carl Rackemann’s name – best to give that one a wide berth. But if some of those players can dredge up some resistance, the case for a walkover transpiring is not so clear. These teams are closer than they look, but one has the comforts of home and the other is travelling on a tour that can become a mobile siege. A few more England players need to capture the frustration, the determination, the unusual steeliness that their captain showed after the match after his far more usual steel out in the middle. Bring that to Adelaide, and there lies the chance of making the old story change.",Sport/Sport,Weaknesses remain in Australia’s Ashes armour despite crushing win | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/12/cricket-australia-weaknesses-gabba-ashes-england

Eggnog has virtually the same ingredients as ice-cream – egg yolks, whipping cream, milk and sugar. Legendary bartender Harry Craddock worked this out in the 1920s at the American Bar at the Savoy, when he created the white cargo, blending equal parts gin and vanilla bean ice-cream.

This was so universal during my childhood that I assumed everybody in Britain had it. GeofCox We always had hot sausage rolls for breakfast on Christmas morning when I was a child. Christmas wouldn’t be the same without them. Sapmagoo Spending the day at Crisis, the only Christmas tradition worth a damn. Shadowcaptain How about the original traditional Christmas activity – going to church? Most churches are extra welcoming to newcomers on Christmas Day, and there will be carols galore! There’s a website called achurchnearyou.com to help you find services. River66 We do Christmas Day parkrun – most events will do one. I volunteer along with my daughter, and my husband and son run. Then we get home for brandy-laced tea, hot toast and presents. Dinner in the late afternoon rather than lunchtime, though..LeBearPolar This is pretty well known, but if you live near the coast, go into the sea ( where it is safe and there are people around). It will shake out the cobwebs and make the rest of the day’s indulgence feel all the more deserved. washoutx My mum goes round the garden in the middle of Christmas Day making a list of everything that is flowering. JenPaws In a house with no children, make a substantial donation to charity. Enjoy a quiet, reflective day and contemplate the true, spiritual meaning of the season. Jayceeyoukay I know of a few families whose pre-Christmas lunch row seems to be an essential part of the festivities, especially when drinking starts early. timbo42 Add nothing – if it becomes a tradition it only adds to the stress and leads to expectation and is a short step to resentment. BermudaRhomboid2 A variation on buck’s fizz – prosecco with pomegranate juice. Been indulging in this for quite a few years as I am the one relegated to the kitchen to peel and prepare vegetables for Christmas dinner. SeepyTea My new tradition is to let my daughter and son-in-law cook while I enjoy a couple of G&Ts. Payback time. I recommend it. Sayingmypeace Posting from rural Quebec, family réveillon starts after midnight mass on Christmas Eve. So technically Christmas Day. Big supper of tourtière (a meat pie made of minced pork, beef and venison from the deer you shot in hunting season), home-baked beans, home-canned pickles and mashed spuds.

Extra points for most pungent/most delicious/stupidest name or most like cat food. Beverley Taylor, Wanstead My favourite non-standard tradition is the Christmas pickle. On Christmas Eve, a special green pickle ornament is hung on the tree somewhere and then, while going through stockings and warming up for present-opening, the kids and adults search for the green pickle ornament in the green foliage. Whoever finds the pickle first gets the pickle present, something silly (think white elephant) that has been wrapped for the purpose ahead of time, usually with pickle-themed wrapping paper. Carson Hill In homage to the original Yule held on the solstice, my children and I started a tradition. As this time of year is about moving from the dark to the light, we each write down on a piece of paper all the shitty things from the past year and aspects of ourselves we want to let go of. The pieces of paper are then burned as we share and welcome in our hopes for the year ahead. It’s like pressing a “reset” button and is surprisingly emotional and cathartic. Jo Thompson, Lincolnshire We play poker. Youngest son has to explain the rules every year and we play for real money which suddenly energises even the most bored teens. Worth buying a proper poker set – an ace present. fishingnet Quality time with one’s beloved on the hearth rug in front of the fire. Not recommended if children or family are present. Winkynuke My family’s long-held Christmas tradition is playing the Hunger Games with our dogs. All discarded wrapping paper/gift packaging is thrown into a big pile in the middle of the living room floor. Dog biscuits are hidden among the wrapping paper/in gift boxes etc and the dogs are released. It’s a race for each dog to find the most biscuits before the other one. At least one dog will get its head stuck in a box during the course of the game. badgergirl24 Decide to live in Spain. You will avoid 95% of the hype, the tawdry commercial garbage that surrounds a “traditional” British Christmas, which is mainly imported from the US. It is a national holiday, of course, and family gatherings are common, but Spanish families tend to live closer together than is the case in Britain, so that is nothing particularly special. No Noddy Holder in the shops from the middle of November, no Queen’s speech and no The Sound of Music on the TV. No massive anxiety attacks and no newspaper articles like this. Fallowfield I wake up at 5am. Have a cold shower and flagellate myself for half an hour, while I think of St Bob Geldof and the starving millions in Africa. Did the message get through and do they know it’s Christmas now, I wonder. After donning a hair shirt, I break my fast with muesli and water. I then go for a brisk walk to the parish church and reflect on the generations buried in the churchyard. Do they know it’s Christmas, I wonder. Once home I listen to Carols from King’s on the radio as I prepare my Christmas lunch. This year it will be nut roast. A small glass of sherry and a moderate portion of food and I feel replete and very privileged. I then listen to a podcast of the collected wit and wisdom of Boris Johnson, it’s very good! Naturally, I stand to attention to watch the Queen’s speech on BBC television. I might then relax with a Baileys (I’ve had it for three years!) and a Rich Tea biscuit. After reading the Bible and thinking did Jesus know it was Christmas, I go to bed with a mug of cocoa and read some light Trollope.

12/12/2021,"Care home bosses have called the first wave of government payouts intended to halt an exodus of workers “derisory”, after it emerged some operators had received grants of just £60 a person before tax. The government has offered amounts from a “retention and recruitment” fund launched by the health secretary, Sajid Javid, that equate to £150 and £155 a worker in some counties and £60 in Norfolk, where one angry manager said it was barely enough to “buy a few boxes of Celebrations”.  “It’s a joke and an insult,” said Raj Sehgal, who runs four care homes in Norfolk. “How are you supposed to retain people for £60 and that is before tax. I am just so angry. It is a slap in the face for every care worker that has worked throughout the pandemic.” He said he was planning to top up the payments to about £200 himself. The sums emerged as councils began distributing cash from the £162.5m fund announced by the government in October, by which time an estimated 60,000 care staff had quit in the previous six months, some joining employers such as Amazon which has been offering £3,000 signing bonuses. Half of local authorities in England had to respond to a care home closure or bankruptcy in the last six months, according to survey results published in November by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services. In response to the growing staffing crisis, the government announced a further £300m of retention money on Friday, which Vic Rayner, the chief executive of the National Care Forum, described as “extremely welcome”. But she added: “It is imperative that the funding gets straight to the frontline in order that each and every care worker feels the benefit of this immediately.” Announcing the additional cash to pay for bonuses and bring forward planned pay rises for care staff, fund overtime and staff banks, Javid said: “This new funding will support our incredible workforce by recruiting new staff and rewarding those who have done so much during this pandemic.” In Scotland and Wales, the governments have offered care workers £500 bonuses. Jo Land, the chief executive of the Avenues Group which employs 1,700 staff in homes for people with learning disabilities across south-east England and Shropshire, has so far been offered the equivalent of £150 a worker by Surrey county council. “I think the amount is derisory,” she said. “These are people working at the frontline for the best part of two years. We are losing staff to Amazon, supermarkets and the NHS.” She said £150 – or about £102 for a full-time worker after tax and national insurance contributions – would not stop anyone filling out an application form now for a better-paid job. Operators expect staff will have to pay tax and national insurance on the bonus and that they will have to pay employers’ national insurance and pension contributions, increasing the strain on already stretched finances. A spokesperson for the Future Social Care Coalition, which is campaigning for a better deal for workers, said: “Anything is better than nothing for the hundreds of thousands of dedicated care workers who are on the government’s minimum wage and never got a bonus last Christmas. But when compared to bonuses being paid in Wales and Scotland and after 21 months of dedicated work it is clear that care and support workers are being shortchanged.” Norfolk county council’s executive director of adult social services, James Bullion, said it decided to channel 75% of the workforce grant it received so far to home care providers because of the acute shortages. They are so far receiving £245 each while each care home will receive £1,600, which if divided among a large staff can work out at £60 or less.",News/Society,‘An insult’: care home bosses decry £60 payouts from Javid’s fund to retain staff ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/12/care-home-bosses-sajid-javid-payouts-fund-to-retain-staff
12/12/2021,"Astone’s throw from the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, in the National Gallery, you can see what the old Flemish painters made of the story of the holy family’s flight into Egypt. Here, with John Eliot Gardiner’s Monteverdi Choir and Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique giving their first concert in their new home venue, you could hear Berlioz’s take on it. L’Enfance du Christ is full of Berlioz’s characteristic moodswings and grand, colourful gestures: it’s an oratorio that sounds as though it desperately wants to be an opera, perfect for the characterful period winds and brass of Gardiner’s orchestra and for the top-flight cast of soloists he had assembled here. Michael Spyres’s glowing Narrator, Ann Hallenberg’s beatific Mary and Lionel Lhote’s desperate yet noble Joseph – it would have been good to hear more of all three, but Berlioz doesn’t put the spotlight squarely on any one soloist. The smaller roles were taken by singers from the choir; Alexander Ashworth made especially vivid work of the Ishmaelite who takes the family in.  Only William Thomas’s Herod came across as less than authoritative, looking a little wooden as he sang Herod’s wakeful monologue, however cavernous and velvety his voice. But perhaps that’s not so inappropriate for the troubled ruler Berlioz paints so keenly in the orchestra. The violins imitated the phrases of his aria so fervently that you almost felt sorry for him. The way the choir sang the Shepherds’ Farewell made it feel almost like a shared oration in this church setting, and angels, sung by the Trinity Boys Choir from somewhere beyond the balcony, made their spine-tingling effect. When it came to the musical entertainment that’s laid on for the holy family at their new home, Gardiner sat down and just let the trio get on with it – and it was beautifully, energetically played by the flautists Gareth Davies and David Westcombe and harpist Gwyneth Wentink. The concert was being filmed, which was unobtrusive until near the end, when on a couple of occasions Gardiner restarted sections immediately after a smudged entry. Was it to get these perfect for the final edit? It was barely noticeable – but how are we to experience a performance entirely in the moment if the conductor demonstrably isn’t doing so?",Arts/Music,L’Enfance du Christ review – full of colour and character,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/12/lenfance-du-christ-review-full-of-colour-and-character
12/12/2021,"Trying on clothes without stepping into a changing room, seeing your menu choices in 3D, viewing an art gallery’s contents outdoors and, of course, catching a Pokémon. This is the world of augmented reality, and one of its key players announced further additions last week. The owner of Snapchat, the app that offers those quirky animal-face selfies, will give developers the ability to transform any local landscape or building. A user couldscan Big Ben so it can be turned into a wobbly landmark when seen through a phone, or even put the Matrix in their living room.  While Mark Zuckerberg talks about an alternative world in the metaverse, the likes of Snapchat are getting on with transforming this one. “I think we’re starting to see some real fun around being able to play with the power to manipulate, change and edit our physical environments,” says Bobby Murphy, a co-founder and the chief technology officer of Snap. For all the excited talk about the metaverse – the concept of a virtual world populated by digital representations, or avatars, of ourselves – augmented reality (AR) has been in our lives for years. AR is where a digital layer is put over reality, normally via your phone – although Snap recently unveiled whizzy spectacles that allow a similar experience. Think Pokémon Go, where players leave their living rooms to capture the characters outdoors, or Snapchat’s cartoon cat selfies. The next step for AR, and where it starts to bump into woolly notions of the metaverse, is glasses that put a digital overlay on the world – as well as allowing users to film what they see (while igniting a whole load of privacy concerns). This year Snap unveiled spectacles with a proper AR overlay. However, these glasses are for a select few developers only and not for public sale, and have clear shortcomings such as a 30-minute battery life. Glasses are where analysts see AR really taking off. Leo Gebbie, an AR expert at the research firm CCS Insight, sees a future where AR glasses screen street directions straight on to a pedestrian’s lenses. “Rather than looking down at your smartphone … you’ll have a nice display in front of you that simply says ‘you are going to turn left again and then get on the bus that comes around the corner’. That’ll all be provided to you in real time rather than requiring you to have to interrupt your phone to do that,” says Gebbie. He has tried the prototype Snap spectacles and says they have an “impressive” AR display but are “fairly heavy”, don’t look like normal glasses, and the battery life is too short. For AR glasses to really work, he says, they need to be lightweight, fashionable and clear various technical hurdles. CCS Insight forecasts that 71m virtual and augmented reality devices will be sold in 2025, with a market value of $22bn (£16.7bn), compared with 11m devices this year. As soon as the right glasses come along, a wave of products will arrive, in the same way that the advent of the iPhone in 2007 unleashed the app economy, says Giorgio Tarraf, the technology intelligence director at the trend forecasting business L’Atelier BNP Paribas. “Once we have the right device that can instil trust and comfort, that’s when the entire ecosystem of applications is going to emerge, just like the smartphone when the iPhone came out,” he says. Snapchat has 306 million daily users, who between them play with the company’s “lenses” – the layers of augmented reality that they can view through their phones – more than 6bn times a day. Snapchat, via its 250,000 lens creators, now offers 2.5m different AR lenses. New features unveiled at Snap’s annual lens fest last week – a virtual gathering of lens developers, or “creators” – included “world mesh” software that allows developers to scan the geometry of a room and put sophisticated AR overlays, such as the scrolling green characters from the Matrix, on to the room. It is also offering its “landmarker” product – which allows lens creators to impose images on buildings and landscapes – to more developers. Previously, Snap had to do the initial 3D scan that a developer then built upon, as it did with Big Ben, but now any developer can do the initial scan with an iPhone. The climate crisis is also becoming a feature of AR. Other lenses released by Snap this year include viewing how London’s Design Museum will be affected by extreme weather, and peering into the intricate ecosystem of the Great Barrier Reef. As with many technological advances, Murphy says the aim is for people not to notice that they are taking part in an AR environment. “The way that we try to build our technology and design our experiences is almost in a way that we don’t want any members of our community to really even be aware of the depths of the technology that they’re using,” he says. “It’s a much more embedded part of our culture than people realise.”",News/Technology,"Matrix effects, routes on your specs: what next for augmented reality?",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/12/augmented-reality-ar-apps-matrix-effects-route-directions-spectacles
