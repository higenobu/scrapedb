3/19/2022,"By Phil Stewart WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three current and former members of the Tennessee National Guard falsely identified in a Russian media report as mercenaries who were killed in Ukraine are in fact alive and well, the Tennessee National Guard said on Thursday. President Joe Biden ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Ukraine prior to Russia's invasion of the country as part of a broader effort to avoid a direct confrontation with the nuclear-armed adversary. But the report published in Russia's Pravda newspaper identified the Americans by name and gave military ranks for each of them, citing information from pro-Russian militia in Ukraine's Donetsk. The report even offered an intricate explanation for how the three were identified, using items from a backpack ""near the remains of one of the militants"" — including a Tennessee state flag. ""The Tennessee Guard is aware of the fake news coming out of Russia,"" said Tracy O'Grady, a spokesperson for the larger U.S. National Guard. The Tennessee Guard said in a statement: ""They are accounted for, safe and not, as the article headline erroneously states, U.S. mercenaries killed in Donetsk People's Republic."" A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two of the men were still in the Tennessee National Guard and in Tennessee. The other man had left the service was but was alive and accounted for — and not in Ukraine, the official said. The National Guard speculated the militia picked the three men while reviewing official imagery associated with a 2018 deployment by Tennessee's 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment to Ukraine, suggesting all three had been in Ukraine. ""All members of the Tennessee National Guard returned safely to their home state in 2019 after a successful mission,"" it said. Russia on Sunday attacked the main base where, prior to Biden's pullout, the U.S. military had long trained Ukrainian forces. It fired air-launched cruise missiles from Russian airspace at the Yavoriv International Centre for Peacekeeping and Security. The base is located just 15 miles (25 km) from the Polish border.

3/19/2022,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is flexing his diplomatic muscles in a nine-minute video uploaded to Twitter in which the action star and former Governor of California implores Russian soldiers to avoid becoming like his father, a Nazi solider who regretted his involvement in World War II. Schwarzenegger begins his message by tracing his love of Russia and the Russian people to Olympic weightlifter Yuri Petrovich Vlasov, the man who inspired him to pick up weights in the first place. He goes on to recall visiting Russia as an adult, meeting fans, and filming 1988's Red Heat in Moscow, the first American movie allowed to shoot in Red Square. Rolf Konow/Sygma/Getty ""Ever since I was 14 years old, I've had nothing but affection and respect for the people of Russia,"" Schwarzenegger says. ""The strength and the heart of the Russian people have always inspired me. That is why I hope that you will let me tell you the truth about the war in Ukraine and what is happening there."" While the global community has been outraged by Vladimir Putin's unprovoked assault on Ukraine, now in its third week, the people of Russia have largely been fed propaganda regarding the attacks. Schwarzenneger invokes the memory of his father, Gustav Schwarzenegger, a Nazi sergeant in Austria's army during the Second World War, and the lies he was told to justify the abominations he went on to perform. ""When my father arrived in Leningrad, he was all pumped up on the lies of his government,"" Schwarzenegger says. ""When he left Leningrad, he was broken — physically and mentally. He lived the rest of his life in pain — pain from a broken back, pain from the shrapnel that always reminded him of those terrible years and pain from the guilt that he felt. To the Russian soldiers listening to this broadcast: You already know much of the truth that I'm speaking. You've seen it in your own eyes. I don't want you to be broken like my father."" I love the Russian people. That is why I have to tell you the truth. Please watch and share. pic.twitter.com/6gyVRhgpFV — Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) March 17, 2022 The truth about Schwarzenegger's father and his time as a Nazi became public in the late-80s, following the death of the elder Schwarzenegger in 1972, and was brought up again during the actor's run for governor in 2003, and again in 2020 following Schwarzenegger's criticisms of those not heeding COVID restrictions. This time, however, Schwarzenegger hoped to use his father's gruesome ties to break through the lies being fed to Russian soliders and civilians alike. ""I know that your government has told you that this is a war to denazify Ukraine,"" Schwarzenegger says, referencing the Russian president's various justifications for his war, and citing the 141 nations who have condemned his actions in Ukraine. Schwarzenegger then urges the Russian people and the Russian soldiers in Ukraine ""to understand the propaganda and the disinformation that you are being told."" He also acknowledges that not everyone in Russia has bought into the Kremlin's alternative facts, praising the protestors who have taken to the streets and in at least one case, the airways, to denounce the war. ""We know that you've suffered the consequences of your courage. You have been arrested, you've been jailed, and you've been beaten,"" Schwarzenegger says. ""You are my new heroes. You have the strength of Yuri Petrovich Vlasov. You have the true heart of Russia.""

3/19/2022,"MIAMI (AP) — Adrian Kellgren’s family-owned gun company in Florida was left holding a $200,000 shipment of semi-automatic rifles after a longtime customer in Ukraine suddenly went silent during Vladimir Putin’s invasion of the country. Fearing the worst, Kellgren and his company KelTec decided to put those stranded 400 guns to use, sending them to Ukraine's nascent resistance movement to help civilians fight back against a Russian military that has been repeatedly shelling their apartment buildings, schools, hospitals and hiding places. “The American people want to do something,” said Kellgren, a former U.S. Navy pilot. “We enjoy our freedoms, we cherish those things. And when we see a group of people out there getting hammered like this, it’s heartbreaking.” Cocoa-based KelTec's donation is a high-profile example of Americans collecting guns, ammunition, body armor, helmets and other tactical gear in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s promise to arm his citizens. But many similar grassroots efforts have been snarled by inexperience with the complex web of regulations governing the international shipment of such equipment. Kellgren, who has dealt with such red tape for years, managed to connect through a Ukrainian neighbor with a diplomat in the Ukrainian Embassy who helped him secure a federal arms export license in just four days. That process can often take months. This week, as Congress debated whether to send more advanced weapons and defense systems to Ukraine, workers at KelTec’s warehouse forklifted four plastic-wrapped pallets containing their 9 mm foldable rifles for delivery to an undisclosed NATO-run facility. From there, the shipment’s new recipient, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, will be responsible for smuggling the weapons into the war zone. “That’s when the real derring-do and heroism begins,” Kellgren said. From California to New York, elected officials, sheriff’s departments and nonprofits say they have also collected thousands of sets of body armor and millions of rounds of ammunition for Ukraine. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis kicked off a campaign last week to ask police and sheriff’s departments to donate surplus ballistic helmets and other equipment. “We know that it can urgently be used to help stop Putin and save Ukraine,” he said. But hazards abound: One New York City nonprofit leading an effort to collect tactical gear had 400 bulletproof vests stolen before they could be dispatched. Many of the organizers have no clue how to navigate international arms export rules, which sometimes require approvals from the Departments of State, Commerce and Defense to ship even non-lethal tactical gear. Organizers of one such drive in New York are piggybacking on KelTec's license to export 60 long guns they recently collected. “I’m hoping that this movement spreads through the whole United States and every gun store and every gun manufacturer in the U.S. accepts these donations,” Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman said at a news conference Friday. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group for firearms manufacturers, distributed step-by-step instructions this week to its more than 8,000 members on how to apply for an expedited export license. They also provided a list of specific sniper rifles, pistols and ammo requested by Ukraine’s Embassy in Washington. KelTec hopes to arrange more shipments in the future. Its license allows the export of up to 10,000 weapons and the company has offered the Ukrainians their own production line and weekly shipments. Details of KelTec’s efforts surfaced in a Justice Department filing this week by a Maryland-based real estate lawyer, Lukas Jan Kaczmarek, who said that as a volunteer with the Ukrainian-American Bar Association he is helping Ukraine acquire weapons in tandem with Volodymyr Muzylov, the first secretary at the Ukraine Embassy. “I expect to work in this capacity for the duration of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and I have not, am not, and shall not receive any monetary compensation for my assistance,” Kaczmarek wrote in his registration as a foreign agent of the Zelenskyy government. KelTec isn’t the only arms manufacturer to have answered the call. Another Florida company, Adams Arms, posted on its Facebook account a video  of what it said is a shipment of carbine rifles destined for Ukraine. The company has also started selling T-shirts emblazoned with the iconic final broadcast of a bombarded Ukrainian Border Guard unit that told a Russian warship to “Go (expletive) Yourself!” Proceeds from shirt sales will go to the Ukrainian National Bank’s war funds. While rifles are no match for Putin’s firepower of Sukhoi fighter jets and cluster bombs, they can play an important role if the Russians get bogged down in street-to-street combat, retired U.S. Army Major John Spencer said. The semi-automatic rifles KelTec is shipping are perhaps even more valuable than high-tech, anti-aircraft missiles that require extensive training beyond the reach of most civilians, many of whom have never even held a gun before, he said. “Every shipment of firearms is critical,” said Spencer, an urban warfare analyst at the Madison Policy Forum, a New York-based think tank. “You’re giving one more fighter, out of tens of thousands, the opportunity to resist with a simple-to-use weapon.” Kellgren said he’s been inspired by the resourcefulness and tenacity of Ukrainian citizens and is confident the rifles he’s sending will make a difference. “The people of Ukraine have had mostly just civilian firearms and they’re holding off a superpower,” he said. “So the X-factor here not isn’t necessarily what equipment you’re holding. ... It comes down to the will to fight.” ___ AP Writer Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

3/19/2022,"(Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday called for comprehensive peace talks with Moscow, saying Russia would otherwise need generations to recover from losses suffered during the war. Zelenskiy said Ukraine had always offered solutions for peace and wanted meaningful and honest negotiations on peace and security, without delay. ""I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. The time has come for a meeting, it is time to talk,"" he said in a video address released in the early hours of Saturday. ""The time has come to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia's losses will be such that it will take you several generations to recover."" The two sides have been involved in talks for weeks with no sign of a breakthrough. Zelenskiy said Russian forces were deliberately blocking the supply of humanitarian supplies to cities under attack. ""This is a deliberate tactic ... This is a war crime and they will answer for it, 100%,"" he said. Zelenskiy said there was no information about how many people had died after a theatre in the city of Mariupol, where hundreds of people had been sheltering, was struck on Wednesday. More than 130 people had been rescued so far, he said.

3/19/2022,"By Trevor Hunnicutt and David Brunnstrom WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) -The Biden administration made a carefully orchestrated gamble this week, issuing a series of public and private threats to Beijing that it will face consequences if it supports Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The strategy was capped by a tense, seven-hour meeting in Rome on Monday between U.S. President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi. Having fired loud diplomatic salvos at Beijing, Biden administration officials are still debating the next steps to take to ensure China does not help Russia evade Western sanctions or supply weapons to Moscow as casualties mount in Ukraine. One result of the Rome meeting was announced on Thursday - Chinese President Xi Jinping will speak with Biden on Friday about ""managing the competition between our two countries as well as Russia's war against Ukraine,"" the White House said. It is not likely to be an easy conversation. Beijing was combative in the Rome talks, people briefed on the interactions say. One U.S.-based person briefed on the meeting described Chinese officials' response as ""tough"" and ""offensive."" Another said simply that the talks did not go well. Washington is now sorting through a host of unanswered questions, including where any ""red line"" regarding Ukraine that China would need to cross to trigger a U.S. response is, and what exactly that response would be, administration officials say. The Biden administration is waiting to see what China does before deciding on a course of action. ""We're going to be watching closely,"" said White House spokesperson Jen Psaki on Monday. A senior U.S. official said they would be looking at what military, economic, or other support is being provided to Russia. The United States on Monday told allies in NATO and several Asian countries that China had signaled its willingness to provide military and economic aid to Russia to support its war in Ukraine, an accusation that China denies. Sullivan had warned before the talks that China would ""absolutely"" face consequences if it helped Moscow evade sweeping sanctions over Ukraine. China, which announced a ""no limits"" strategic partnership with Russia in February, may find it hard to change course and back down after a threat was made public, said Kevin Gallagher, who leads the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University. ""This wasn't a good strategic move,"" he said. ""Like the United States, China has a domestic constituency."" He Weiwen, senior fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Beijing's Renmin University said: ""The U.S. has an intention to crackdown on China, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict provides a reason for it to do so,"" describing the U.S. warnings as ""blackmail."" Sources in the Biden administration and diplomats in Washington and Europe say Western countries had been sending private warnings to Beijing about China's support for Russian President Vladimir Putin for weeks before the Rome meeting. Russia has denied asking China for military assistance, and China warned this week of ""false information,"" in apparent reference to U.S. statements. ""China firmly opposes any words and deeds that spread false information and distort and smear China's position,"" Yang said, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Beijing's official newspaper, the People's Daily, carried a column noting the inaccurate U.S. intelligence that led to the Iraq invasion. Some U.S. allies also quietly questioned the intelligence Washington was relying upon regarding the Russian and Chinese conversations, several European diplomatic sources said. SANCTIONS DISCUSSIONS NOT ADVANCED Discussions between the United States and its military allies of any coordinated sanctions that could apply to Beijing are not advanced, according to one person involved in those conversations. A move to sanction China over Ukraine would have potentially dire consequences, not just for China, but for the U.S. and global economies, analysts say. China trades vastly more with the United States and its NATO than it does with Russia, and the Chinese economy relies heavily on international markets and capital. However, the talks between Sullivan and Yang did not focus on trade, one U.S. official noted. Biden entered office regarding China as the key foreign policy challenge of the era, one that required a more hardline defense of democratic values against autocratic competitors. But Biden hoped that his candid personal relationship with China's leader could defuse the likelihood of a Cold War or a direct military clash between the world's current superpower and its rising superpower, including over the status of Taiwan. ""China is either going to side with Russia and reinforce the sense that it has joined an 'axis of autocracy,' or it is going to put significant space between Moscow and Beijing and demonstrate that it genuinely cares about preserving even a basic relationship with the rest of the world,"" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""If it turns down this opportunity, it's not clear to me there will be a next time to meet and set aside differences. The ball is entirely in Beijing's court.""
