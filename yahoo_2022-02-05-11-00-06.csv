2/5/2022,"A woman wants to separate her finances from her husband after he made some poor financial decisions. She asked Reddit’s “Am I the A******? (AITA)” forum to weigh in. She and her husband share 100% of their income. However, he is less responsible with money, and she is the breadwinner. After he made a few recent purchases, she asked him to divide their earnings up.

The past few months, I decided to finally get out from under $20,000 in credit card debt in my name. I sold my engagement ring and car (with my husband’s full support). “On my husband’s side, he’s been less willing to make lifestyle changes. His car he bought last summer (an AMG Mercedes) costs over $900/mo with high interest and insurance. It’s been in the shop for months, and they’ve officially diagnosed a $2,900 repair. He has $7,000 on a card racking up over $100 a month in interest that he hasn’t made a dent in because he keeps using it.” Shop In The Know cover star Storm Reid's high-fashion looks The woman came up with a possible resolution to solve the issue, but her husband wasn’t receptive at all. “My husband makes $75,000 a year; I now make $116,000,” she wrote. “He is underwater on the car loan. He wants to trade in for a Mustang GT, rolling in negative equity. He doesn’t want to trade in for a cheap beater for a year. We have no meaningful savings right now. Tonight I told him I wanted to separate finances.” “Not even completely — just 30% of our paychecks now get transferred out into separate accounts for our own discretionary spending. Anything in the joint now goes to bills and savings. I told him we’d revisit in a month or two when the car situation is sorted to explore 100% separate finances, 60/40 bill split. He’s very upset, saying the car is an important hobby for him and my idea solves nothing, it only creates more stress and division.” Redditors warned the poster that this could end in disaster. “While you’re separating finances, separate lives too. This dude will ruin you,” a user wrote. “You should not have to be responsible for your husband’s bad financial decisions,” another said. “He needs to grow up and become financially responsible,” someone commented.

2/5/2022,"One very lucky guy just collected a six-figure lottery win in Virginia, after all 264 of his tickets came up winners in two separate drawings, Virginia Lottery officials say. Yes, 264 tickets. Jalen Taylor of Charlottesville won $132,000 when each ticket proved to be worth $500, Virginia Lottery officials said in a Feb. 3 news release. The prize came after Taylor went big and bought two large batches of Pick 3 tickets over a two-month span. The first was 104 tickets with the numbers 960 he got for the Nov. 18 drawing, and the second was 160 tickets with the numbers 542 he purchased for the Jan. 10 drawing. Tickets are $1 each. Both of his 3-digit combinations were drawn, netting him $52,000 with the first batch and $80,000 with the second, officials said. All the tickets came from grocery stores (Food Lion and Harris Teeter) and Taylor didn’t say how he decided on the numbers. (Players can pick any three-digit sequence from 000 to 999.) “I had a feeling,” Taylor said in the release. “When you get a feeling, just play!” Taylor said he intends to save the cash and invest. He beat odds of 1 in 1,000 by picking the three winning numbers. State officials didn’t give the odds of doing it twice in eight weeks.

2/5/2022,"Kevin McCarthy refused to defend two of his colleagues after the RNC's formal censure He suggested that Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger's congressional careers are over. ""I think those two individuals will have a hard time ever coming back to Congress,"" McCarthy said. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Friday that Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger's congressional careers are effectively over, declining to support them after the Republican National Committee's censure. ""I think those two individuals will have a hard time ever coming back to Congress,"" McCarthy said on Fox News. McCarthy, who once counted Cheney as one of his top deputies, sounded bemused as he pointed out that Kinzinger is ""quitting"" and that Cheney ""has a very low poll rating in Wyoming."" The RNC formally censured the two Republicans on Friday, citing their participation in the House January 6 Committee as evidence of their apostasy against the party. The resolution refers to the committee's ""persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse."" After intense criticism, RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel later clarified that the resolution did not intend to refer to the ransacking of the Capitol as ""legitimate political discourse."" Unlike Kinzinger, Cheney is running for reelection in the face of a Trump-backed primary opponent. CNN reported that McCarthy has thus far declined to take a position on whether he would support Cheney. Traditionally, the party supports all incumbents in the event of a contested race.

2/5/2022,"Missouri Gov. Mike Parson has no “litmus test for appointments,” his spokeswoman said Friday, despite a statement earlier in the week indicating he would only nominate a state health director who shared his “Christian values.” The Republican governor, a Baptist, was angered after the Missouri Senate effectively ousted Donald Kauerauf as director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Though Kauerauf opposes government mask and vaccine mandates and opposes abortion, hardline conservatives in the legislature questioned if he was conservative enough. In announcing Kauerauf's resignation on Tuesday, Parson wrote in a statement: “Don is a public health expert that is on record opposing masking requirements and COVID-19 vaccine mandates. He is outspokenly pro-life and morally opposed to abortion. Missourians know that I share these beliefs and would not have nominated someone who does not share the same Christian values.” The statement prompted some to wonder if only Christians need apply for top-level jobs in the Parson administration. “I’m curious Governor, is this a standard you traditionally use?” Republican state Rep. Adam Schwadron of St. Charles wrote on Twitter. “Article VI of the US Constitution strictly prohibits a religious test as a qualification to any office or public trust. Considering that, I then must ask the question. Would someone who is Jewish, such as myself, be considered for nomination?” But Kelli Jones, spokeswoman for Parson, said in an email that the governor's statement “was intended to point out that Don Kauerauf shared values that aligned with the Governor’s and was not intended to imply that he imposes a requirement that job applicants adhere to any particular religion.” Parson, Jones said, “has never required a religious litmus test for appointments as evidenced by the broad spectrum of religious backgrounds of his appointees. Just because an appointee happens to possess values that align with the Governor’s Christian faith doesn’t mean that he requires them to adhere to his religion.” Jones cited as an example Parson's appointment of former state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed of St. Louis to the state Board of Probation and Parole. Nasheed is a Democrat and a Muslim. Still, Parson's statement drew plenty of criticism. “The governor's remarks are offensive and undermine our nation's promise of religious freedom, which is the fundamental right to believe or not, as we choose, and to know that our government will treat us equally,” said Rachel Laser, CEO of Americans for Separation of Church and State. The Interfaith Partnership of Greater St. Louis, whose mission statement says it's goal is to deepen “understanding, respect and appreciation among all persons across lines of religious difference,” expressed concern in an open letter to Parson. “People of all faiths and no faith, in a variety of occupations and vocations, make significant contributions to our state and community every day,” the letter stated. In a 2017 interview with the Jefferson City-based Christian publication Word&Way, then Lt. Gov. Parson discussed the importance of faith in his role as a government leader. “First of all, I can’t even begin to imagine to do these jobs if you don’t have faith,” Parson said. “I mean, if you’re not a believer, there’s no way, I believe, you can be a truly effective leader because when you are in this arena you are a leader. And to make decisions without faith, to me, would be impossible. I don’t know how you make the decision and how you’re going to affect the future if you don’t have belief and faith.” —- This story has been corrected to show Parson’s interview with Word&Way happened in 2017 not 2018.",Politics/Associated Press,Missouri governor's 'Christian values' statement questioned,https://news.yahoo.com/missouri-governors-christian-values-statement-192906311.html
2/5/2022,"In a hilarious new TikTok trend, parents are exposing what their babies looked like when they were first born. While every parent participating in this trend undoubtedly loves and cherishes their newborns, it’s hard to deny that babies fresh out of the proverbial oven look, well, a little under-baked. But according to Dr. Kelly Culwell, an OB-GYN and Forbes Health Advisory Board Member, there’s a fascinating explanation for why newborns look the way they do. Join In The Know by Yahoo's Parenting Facebook group, where you can connect with other new parents, find trending content, product recommendations & more! In the Know asked Dr. Culwell why newborns have that characteristic “smooshed” look after entering the world. “The ‘scrunching’ of the face is actually swelling that usually occurs during labor and delivery,” Dr. Culwell said. “This can be particularly noticeable if the newborn spent a long time in the birth canal (vagina) such as when the third stage of labor (the pushing stage once the cervix is completely dilated) is prolonged.” And that strange-looking “goop” newborns are coated in? Think of it as a kind of in utero lotion for your baby’s skin. “The ‘goop’ is called ‘vernix,’ and it develops when the fetus is inside the womb (uterus) to protect the skin from the amniotic fluid,” said Dr. Culwell. “It is like a layer of moisturizer.” But if that “goop” has a dark green hue, it’s called “meconium,” and it might indicate that your baby took a little bathroom break during labor. “This is actually a sign that the baby pooped inside the uterus, which can happen if labor was particularly difficult or stressful for the baby,” said Dr. Culwell. “But it usually doesn’t cause any problems, as long as the material is suctioned out of the baby’s mouth right away after birth.” Shop luxurious looks from In The Know cover star Brandon Blackwood Babies fresh out of the womb are also known for their distinctive coloration, which can contribute to their shocking appearance. “Newborns are usually pink but can develop bruises during the birthing process,” said Dr. Culwell. “It is also normal for hands and feet to be a little bit blue, as the newborn transitions from relying entirely on the placenta for oxygen to getting their oxygen through breathing.” Their shape, too, can take new parents by surprise — specifically that of their little heads. “Newborns can also have a ‘conehead’ appearance, especially with prolonged labor,” explained Dr. Culwell. “The bones in the newborn skull are not fused together to allow for flexibility in making the way through the vagina during delivery. This usually resolves within a few days.” Their head shape can also be impacted by how they were born, according to Dr. Culwell. “There can also be swelling of the scalp over the area that was the first to come out during delivery, or if a vacuum was used to help with delivery,” she explained. “These issues are less common in babies that are born by C-section if they didn’t spend much [or] any time in the birth canal.” No matter how newborns look when parents first meet them, it’s sure to be love at first sight — even if that sight can be a little surprising at first!
