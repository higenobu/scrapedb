12/30/2021,"DoorDash is reinstating its WeDash program. The program requires staff â€” including the CEO â€” to work as delivery drivers at least once a month. One employee who said they make $400K a year vented on social media about having to do the program. The delivery service DoorDash is making all its employees â€” even the CEO â€” deliver at least once a month, but not everyone is happy about the initiative, and some employees have turned to an anonymous employee social platform to vent. Under its WeDash program, employees â€” including those in DoorDash's corporate offices â€” must serve as delivery drivers at least once a month. If they can't deliver, they can choose other experiences, such as shadowing customer-service staff. WeDash is the company's flagship employee-engagement program, which aims to have workers ""learn firsthand how the technology products we build empower local economies, which in turn helps us build a better product,"" a DoorDash spokesperson said. One DoorDash employee who reported a total annual compensation of $400,000 complained about the DoorDash initiative on the anonymous employee social platform Blind in a post titled ""Doordash making engineers deliver food."" ""Mandatory 'WeDash' starts from next year. You need to dash once a month. WILL BE TRACKED IN PERFORMANCE REVIEWS!! What the actual fuck? I didn't sign up for this, there was nothing in the offer letter/job description about this,"" the post said. The post has generated over 1,600 comments since December 19. Blind confirmed to Insider that the original post was from a DoorDash employee. The platform requires users to sign up using their work email addresses and continues to verify their employment occasionally. ""Not acceptable in any way!"" a Blind user who works at eBay commented. ""And most of us would wave bye bye ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘‹,"" wrote another DoorDash employee. But some DoorDash employees came to the program's defense. ""Most of my coworkers and I are excited. DD pays well and I get to better understand what I'm working on, and hopefully improve the experience for our dashers. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯,"" a DoorDash user posted on Blind. Another DoorDash employee said he didn't think the task was as big a deal as the original poster, but that ""this should have been placed in the job description of people's employment contracts."" ""Seriously? They're paying you 400K and want you to deliver food once a month so you can actually experience your product and you're complaining? What's wrong with you?"" posted a user who works at DocuSign. A DoorDash spokesperson said the WeDash program had been around since the company's inception, but it was paused during the pandemic. It's now being reinstated. ""The sentiment of the employee on Blind is not a reflection of the employee base at large,"" the spokesperson added.
