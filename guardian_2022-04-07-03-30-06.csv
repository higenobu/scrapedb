4/7/2022,"Arequest works best when backed by menaces. The housing secretary, Michael Gove, seems to be close to getting much of what he wants from stage one of his operation to raise serious sums to fix the cladding and fire-safety crisis that was appallingly highlighted by the Grenfell Tower disaster of 2017. Fifty-three developers were invited, on pain of being cut out of planning approvals, to sign a building safety pledge that commits them to fund the costs of remediation work on all medium- and high-rise buildings they have built over the past 30 years. The number of corporate holdouts is likely to be in low single digits. Barratt Developments was the latest big name to sign on Wednesday, making a provision of £350m to £400m, even though, as it said, cladding and wall systems were signed off as compliant at the time. Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey, Berkeley, Crest Nicholson, Redrow, Gleeson and more are also on board. The pledge-signers have also promised not to make claims on the £5bn building safety fund that will remediate buildings taller than 18 metres. Since the cash for that fund will be raised in part by a 4% levy on residential developers’ profits for the next 10 years, you can understand why a few executives grumble about paying twice. Well, yes, but that’s politics. Gove’s “polluter pays” exercise was a welcome relief after predecessor Robert Jenrick’s grotesque attempt to load costs on to leaseholders. Equally, however, there must come a point at which the remaining bill has to be spread more widely. This is the tricky stage at which Gove has arrived: how to fund work on so-called “orphan” buildings of 11 to 18 metres that were built by foreign firms or firms that have subsequently gone bust. The tally will also include buildings more than 30 years old and those that local authorities may have installed defective cladding after construction. The bill for that lot could be as much as £3bn, though it’s hard to be precise because the housing department is less than transparent about its modelling. The easy option would be to hit the big housebuilders with another levy, on top of the annual 4% tax that kicked in this month, but it hardly seems proportionate. This may be one of those very rare occasions where the housebuilding industry – a place of fat profit-margins, big boardroom bonuses and soft subsides such as help to buy – deserves a modicum of sympathy. As a report from the housing select committee put it last month, there are two challenges with the “polluter pays” principle: multiple polluters, and untraceable polluters. On the multiple front, the list of non-developers which contributed to fire-safety failures over many years is long. Aside from manufacturers of shoddy cladding, the committee noted product suppliers, installers, contractors, subcontractors, architects, building control and the redevelopment industry. They’ve barely been touched by Gove’s efforts to date. On the untraceable front, UK developers may reasonably ask how hard Gove is trying to trace and chase foreign firms. The House Builders Federation estimates UK housebuilders built less than 10% of the estimated 8,000 buildings still in need of remediation. Gove’s department promises a full funding package in due course. We’ll see what it brings but, if more requests-cum-threats are needed, Gove ought to find new targets. Moonpig is the oddly named company with a neat business model in the world of online greetings cards and gifts. The beauty of the cards side is that the product can be printed when the customer orders; and the add-on gifts can be pitched to a highly engaged audience. Meanwhile, e-commerce breezes should be favourable for years to come. It was on this basis that Moonpig commanded a £1.2bn valuation when it floated last year at 350p a share. Buyers at that lofty price-tag cannot complain about subsequent newsflow: Moonpig has upgraded its guidance several times, including this week. The lockdown boost to revenues is inevitably fading but all the underlying long-term trends seem intact. But, oh dear, look what’s happened to the share price: having flown as high as 480p, it is now 211p. The moral of this tale is probably the old one that the flotation hype machine should never be trusted. It’s not Moonpig’s management’s fault, but the general e-commerce frenzy of a year ago now looks wildly overdone. The company will probably keep growing for years, but £1.2bn for a greetings cards business with £300m-ish of revenue was always likely to be too much, too soon.",News/Business,Michael Gove needs to cast ‘polluters pay’ net further in cladding crisis | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/06/michael-gove-needs-to-cast-polluters-pay-net-further-cladding-crisis-housebuilders
4/7/2022,"Grant Shapps has privately promised to scrap a controversial £3bn branch of the HS2 train line that carves through the constituency of the 1922 Committee chair, Sir Graham Brady, and two other Tory MPs, the Guardian understands. The link, known as the Golborne spur, would connect the main Crewe-Manchester HS2 line to the west coast mainline just south of Wigan. Brady, the Tory MP for Altrincham and Sale West, which would be affected by the spur, wrote to a constituent last week saying Shapps had given him “categorical verbal assurances” that it would be removed from the HS2 bill currently going through parliament. The link has been the subject of heated lobbying by MPs in the Warrington, Wigan and Trafford areas where their constituencies would be affected. But the private assurances from Shapps to Brady, who runs the powerful 1922 Committee of backbenchers, may raise questions about why the transport secretary has not made public any decision. The government had promised in its integrated rail review to consider alternatives to the spur, which would have joined HS2 to the west coast mainline and cut the journey time to Glasgow. However, the HS2 bill published in February included plans to keep it, much to the dismay of MPs in the area. Despite the appearance of the Golborne link in legislation, Brady told his constituent it would soon be removed from the bill by the Department for Transport, claiming it was only in there to prevent delays in its publication. In his letter, Brady said: “I have received categorical, verbal assurances from the secretary of state that the government will table an amendment as part of the second reading of the bill. This will remove the Golborne spur from the legislation. This is expected to take place in the summertime. The only reason that the bill was introduced with the spur still in place is that a revised environmental impact assessment would have delayed the introduction of legislation.” The bill is likely to be carried over into the next session of parliament after the Queen’s speech in May, with its second reading in the summer. Alternative routes are being considered but one proposed in the union connectivity review drew criticism from Wigan council, which supports the Golborne link, for bypassing the town, meaning it would lose benefits. Brady told the Guardian: “Local Conservative MPs Andy Carter, James Grundy and I have been campaigning for years to make the case for this £4bn white elephant to be dropped. A new environmental impact assessment would have delayed the introduction of the bill for months so the Golborne spur is in the bill as published but I am delighted that the government has accepted our commonsense argument. “I hope the next thing will be a decision to locate the proposed ‘Manchester airport’ station at the airport – not a quarter of a mile away at Davenport Green as currently proposed.” James Grundy represents Leigh, where opponents say the village of Lowton would lose a business park, civic field and woodland if the link went ahead. Andy Carter represents Warrington South, where campaigners say it would negatively affect the greenbelt without benefiting the town. The Labour MP Charlotte Nichols, whose seat is Warrington North, also opposed the spur. In Altrincham, Brady has criticised the line for dividing the historic village of Warburton. Shapps has previously sounded less than enthusiastic about the Golborne spur, citing it in 2020 as an example of an area that could be reworked, saying it added billions to the cost with little benefit. A government source said: “No decisions have yet been made. It is the government’s intention to deliver the right infrastructure for long-term benefits to the rail network, the North and Scotland.”",News/UK news,Senior Tory says Shapps privately assured him £3bn HS2 branch will be scrapped,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/06/senior-tory-graham-brady-grant-shapps-privately-assured-hs2-branch-scrapped
4/7/2022,"People who listen to podcasts are more likely to be curious, more open to experience and less neurotic on average than non-listeners, a new study suggests. Researchers surveyed 306 people from more than 10 countries on their podcast listening habits, comparing their listening habits with measures of personality. They found that people who reported ever having listened to a podcast scored more highly for openness to experience, interest-based curiosity, and need for cognition – a measure reflecting an individual enjoyment of “effortful cognitive endeavours”. Podcast listeners were also less likely to score highly for neuroticism, the tendency to experience negative emotions. “That’s quite different from social media use,” said study co-author Dr Stephanie Tobin, a senior lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology. “There’s a positive association between neuroticism and using social media,” she said. Of podcast listeners, those who scored more highly on the trait of agreeableness were more likely to report forming parasocial relationships with their favourite podcast hosts. “Parasocial relationships were associated with listening for longer and listening to podcasts by known hosts,” the study’s authors found. “The more you listen, the more you socially engage and feel like the favourite host is a friend,” Tobin said, adding that this association seemed to have positive outcomes. “Feeling like the podcast host was your friend was related to feeling generally more connected with other people,” she said. Previous research has shown that the method of podcast listening can affect “perceived intimacy”, finding that people felt more empathic and persuadable when hearing podcasts through headphones compared to through speakers. The study participants ranged in age from 18 to 64, with average age of 27.9. Of the respondents, 78% reported being podcast listeners. The most popular podcast categories were comedy (48%), games and hobbies (34%), society and culture (23%), music (23%) and news and politics (23%). Fewer than half of listeners engaged with podcast less than monthly, while 30% listened weekly and 12.5% were daily listeners. Podcast listening was negatively correlated with the need to belong, which Tobin said was an unexpected finding. “In the past, [the need to belong] has been related to some aspects of social media use and parasocial relationships with other kinds of media figures.” Previous research has found that people who score highly for the trait report more addictive social media habits. The researchers emphasised that while certain personality traits were correlated with podcast listening, they could not establish causal links. They did not study whether the frequency of listening or preference for podcast types were associated with different traits, or whether podcast listeners were also radio listeners. Another limitation of the study was that it relied on self-reports of listening habits. The study was published in the journal Plos One.",News/Australia news,Podcast listeners likely to be more curious and less neurotic – study,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/podcast-listeners-likely-to-be-more-curious-and-less-neurotic-study
4/7/2022,"At Amen Corner, you hear the songs without ever seeing the birds. When an 89-year-old Sam Snead cracked a patron on the head with a sliced ceremonial tee shot in 2002, Augusta media outlets were discreet in their coverage. On testing by a bold golf journalist in 1996, it was discovered that the immaculate blue ponds at Augusta National are delivered with the assistance of food dye. Fred Ridley, the club chairman, was asked on Wednesday to mark the 10th anniversary of women being afforded membership by confirming some numbers. “No thanks,” was the essence of his reply. Illusion everywhere. We do not know the precise circumstances of 23 February and the single-car crash involving Tiger Woods on the outskirts of Los Angeles. It seems fair to assume we never will. As Woods launches his latest, apparently miraculous recovery at a venue where he has been victorious five times there is cause to ponder what resembles reality. Woods clearly relishes playing a leading role in melodrama. When he pointed towards a “game-time decision” over whether to feature in the Masters, it was as if Woods’s right leg and foot – now held together by nuts and bolts – would somehow be in a profoundly different condition on Thursday than Monday. Here we have a golfer who claims he was lucky to retain life and limbs 14 months ago, who has not played competitively since November 2020 and who in November 2021 stated he was “so far” from competing with the world’s best. The same individual, with a straight face, insisted during media duties this week that he thinks he can win the Masters. Woods is not known for public delusion, which could ultimately make him look silly. It is highly unlikely he would make a bold prediction, or even turn up in Georgia at all, if thinking back-to-back rounds of 78 were possible. Others in this Masters field are of the mind that the 15-time major winner will play well. It is just that none of this tallies with what was said and done before. It is like the lives of Augusta National and Tiger Woods are perfectly choreographed, while the rest of us are left to guess where mirage begins and ends. Woods signed off from pre-tournament practice on Wednesday morning with a drive floated into the middle of the 18th fairway. From there, he fired an iron to 8ft and converted for a birdie three. The crowds whooped and hollered; they believe, all right. What a boost the Masters has received, not for the first time, by Woods’s very involvement. That Woods’s golf looks so sharp infers he has been allowed far more time with club in hand in recent times than anybody on the outside understood. It is precisely the way Woods has always wanted it. If come Sunday evening the man pulled from a mangled SUV on a sunny Californian morning is even in the frame for the Masters the latest chapter in a life story which would be discarded by fiction editors will have been penned. Woods must at least fancy his chances of making the cut, given 50 and ties from a field of just 91 – that includes six amateurs and the 64-year-old Sandy Lyle – survive for round three. Woods has returned to a young man’s game. Eight of the top 10 players in the world are aged 30 or under. Part of the ongoing issue for Rory McIlroy, a veritable veteran at 32, is the wave of fresh blood that has appeared behind him. Yet McIlroy must take hope from the fact so many of the principle protagonists in this major are in questionable touch. It is for that reason that an obvious favourite is impossible to identify. Scottie Scheffler, who has shot to world No 1 with three wins in 2022, has only played here twice, finishing 19th and 18th. Justin Thomas’s strong claims on this tournament are seemingly boosted by a close alliance with Woods. The pair played practice holes together last week and this. If Woods imparts Augusta knowledge, it is assumed Thomas is the beneficiary. There are a couple of problems with this theory. Woods has never been particularly keen to hand competitive advantages to an opponent. Why would he then and why would he now? Thomas may also reach the point where being in the company of Woods so often becomes exhausting. The scale of gallery attention on the duo even during build-up work here has to be a distraction. So, too, the fact so much of Thomas’s time is taken up by answering questions about his supposed mentor. Thomas is easily good enough to win the 86th Masters and deserves to be counted among the leading lights but that must be on his own terms rather than by association. Jordan Spieth deserves to be mentioned in dispatches on account of Augusta specialism and admirable recovery from a serious slump that hampered the Texan after his Open success of 2017. “I feel like my game is in a great spot,” said the winner of three majors. “I feel like I am ready to contend.” Jon Rahm, Dustin Johnson, Xander Schauffele, Brooks Koepka and Cameron Smith, the newly crowned Players champion, are worthy of consideration. Bryson DeChambeau, not so long ago golf’s man of the moment, regards himself as 80% fit. It has been widely forgotten that Bubba Watson, who has shown glimpses of a return to form, is a two-time Masters champion. Justin Rose typically carries British hopes but Paul Casey has long since displayed a level of style and ability that could prevail here. For now, these all feel like distant subplots. Against all odds, the Tiger is back in town. If nothing else, the past few days have served as a reminder of how much this sport will miss him – and his layers of intrigue – when he is gone.",Sport/Sport,The Tiger is back in Masters town where illusion and mystery rule | Ewan Murray,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/06/the-tiger-is-back-in-masters-town-where-illusion-and-mystery-rule
4/7/2022,"Fred Ridley, the chairman of Augusta National, has denied Phil Mickelson was banned by the club from competing in the Masters this week and insisted the former champion’s non‑appearance in Georgia was entirely the 51-year-old’s own decision. Mickelson has not played since infamous comments relating to his role in a Saudi Arabian-backed breakaway tour emerged in February. The head of the PGA Tour, Jay Monahan, refused to publicly confirm that Mickelson would have been welcome at the Players’ Championship last month. Augusta’s approach at least appears softer. Asked to respond to speculation about why Mickelson neither attended the champions’ dinner this week nor formed part of the field, Ridley said: “I would like to say we did not disinvite Phil. Phil reached out to me, I think it was in late February, early March, and let me know that he did not intend to play. That was by way of a text. I thanked him for his courtesy in letting me know. “Phil has been a real fixture here at the Masters for many, many years. He’s been a big part of our history. We certainly wish him the best working through the issues he’s dealing with right now.” Ridley was more circumspect on Augusta’s likely stance regarding players who choose to commit to the Saudi plan. The DP World Tour and the PGA Tour have been firm in their resistance to the scheme. “I would start by saying that our mission is always to act in the best interests of the game in whatever form that may take,” Ridley said. “I think that golf is in a good place right now. There’s more participation. Purses on the professional tours are the highest they have ever been. Clubs and courses I think are in healthy financial positions. The youth that is emerging at a competitive level is just amazing. “We have been pretty clear in our belief that the world tours have done a great job in promoting the game over the years. Beyond that, there’s so much that we don’t know about what might happen or could happen. I just don’t think I could say much more beyond that.”",Sport/Sport,"Phil Mickelson not banned from Masters, says Augusta chairman",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/06/phil-mickelson-not-banned-from-masters-says-augusta-chairman
4/7/2022,"British Gas has doubled the emergency credit available to customers who are on pre-payment meters for their gas and electricity after this month’s hike in energy prices. The supplier has written to customers who have an electric key or gas card telling them that they can continue to use energy until they are £10 over their pre-payments, up from the previous £5. The email reminds customers: “If you do need to use emergency credit, you’ll have to repay the amount of credit used at your next top up as well as the amount you’d usually purchase.” It adds: “It’s also a good idea to top up regularly during the warmer months to stay on top of standing charges.” The cost of gas and electricity and the standing charges paid each day for having a supply went up on 1 April for customers on variable rate tariffs, with the average annual bill going up by 54%. Charities and thinktanks have warned of a growing number of people in “fuel stress”, with the Resolution Foundation estimating that 5 million households in England were now spending 10% or more of their budgets on energy bills. It said a further rise in prices in October could push another 2.5 million households into fuel stress, with the issue “more acute in poorer households, those in the north and Midlands, and those in wasteful, energy-inefficient homes”. There are about 4.5 million pre-payment customers in Great Britain, and they are often among the poorest and most vulnerable households. They have higher price cap charges than those who pay by direct debit but typically pay less than those who pay by cash and cheque when they receive their bill. While the price cap for average usage is £1,971 for direct debit customers, it is £2,017 for pre-payment customers – an increase of £708 a year on the previous level. Pre-payment customers may also have to wait longer than other households for the £150 council tax rebate to help with energy costs aimed at those in band A-D homes, unless they pay their council tax by direct debit. Local authorities will pay the money directly into the bank accounts of those with direct debits set up, but for other residents they will contact households and ask them to apply. Last week British Gas announced it was adding £2m to a fund to help struggling customers with their energy costs. Its Energy Support Fund provides grants of between £250 and £750 towards bills to qualifying applicants who have less than £1,000 in savings. It said more than a third of the recipients were on disability benefit, while 30% were single-parent families.",News/Business,British Gas doubles emergency credit for those on pre-pay meters,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/06/british-gas-doubles-emergency-credit-for-those-on-pre-pay-meters
4/7/2022,"In her prizewinning memoir The Years, the author Annie Ernaux recalled the collective panic on the French left in 2002, when Jean-Marie Le Pen unexpectedly made it to the runoff in that year’s presidential election. “Before we had time to think,” she wrote, “we were swept into the frenzy of a mass mobilisation to save French democracy.” A hastily assembled republican front ensured that Jacques Chirac, the centre-right candidate for the Élysée, won an overwhelming 82% of the vote in the second round. Progressive voters held their noses and did the necessary. As Ms Ernaux put it: “Better a vote that stinks than a vote that kills.” Two decades later, it seems likely that Emmanuel Macron will need to rely on a similar spirit in this month’s presidential election. After a slow and fractious start to Marine Le Pen’s campaign, polls now suggest she has a good chance of achieving the far right’s best election result since her father founded the Front National in 1972. One recent survey placed her only three percentage points behind Mr Macron in a potential second round runoff. In a newspaper column designed as an urgent wake-up call, the former French prime minister Manuel Valls wrote last weekend: “It’s one minute to midnight … Marine Le Pen could be elected president of the republic.” That dire outcome – which would have seismic consequences for Europe at a time of multiple crises – remains unlikely. The polls have tightened partly because the bounce Mr Macron enjoyed after his diplomatic efforts over Ukraine has subsided, but he still enjoys a comfortable lead in most. And while the taboo on voting for the far right might not carry the force it did in 2002, it still exists: in one survey, 50% of French voters said they would never vote for Ms Le Pen. Nevertheless, compared with 2017, when she was humiliated by Mr Macron in debate and lost the second round vote by a 66% to 34% margin, she has momentum, and vital factors have aligned in her favour. The obsessive Islamophobia and racism of Ms Le Pen’s far-right rival, the television polemicist Éric Zemmour, has allowed her to present herself as the moderate face of nationalism. Even more importantly, a strategic stump focus on the economy and the cost-of-living crisis – the number one concern for French voters – has proved spectacularly well-timed and turbocharged this rebranding process. While Mr Macron is determined to raise the pension age to 65 and toughen up welfare rules, Ms Le Pen has said she will allow retirement at 60 and pledged to increase the purchasing power of the less well off. Lurking in the background, the far-right aspirations at the heart of Ms Le Pen’s programme remain as divisive and discriminatory as ever. Radical anti-immigrant proposals and new border controls would place France in conflict with EU law, and a pledge to protect “the composition and identity of the French people” channels the assumptions of white replacement theory. But she has largely parked the toxic stuff offstage, successfully widening her appeal and normalising her politics. A far closer race means that if Sunday’s first-round vote does deliver another head-to head runoff between Mr Macron and Ms Le Pen, the president will be reliant on the left’s votes to win it. But almost half the hard-left supporters of the third-placed candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, have said they would abstain instead. Some centre-right voters have meanwhile indicated they would opt for Ms Le Pen. Compared with 2002, and even 2017, the traditional republican front is thus looking dangerously battered and bruised. But given the authoritarian, xenophobic nature of the alternative, it is crucial for France and for Europe that it holds.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Marine Le Pen’s surge: alarm bells ring | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/06/the-guardian-view-on-marine-le-pens-surge-alarm-bells-ring
4/7/2022,"Ukraine has urged civilians to leave the east of the country “while the opportunity still exists” before a massive Russian military assault that it expects in the coming days. The deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the authorities would “not be able to help” residents who stayed behind once large-scale fighting erupted. She said the governors of the Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions were calling on people to move immediately to safer areas. “It has to be done now, because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death. There is nothing they will be able to do about it,” she posted on Telegram.The deputy prime minister emphasised: “It is necessary to evacuate as long as this possibility exists. For now, it still exists.” The Kremlin has said it intends to seize the entire Donetsk region, amid reports that Putin is keen to declare victory in Ukraine in time for 9 May, the annual commemoration of the Soviet defeat of Hitler in the second world war. One western official said Putin would want to have an “announceable success” by then, which could create “some tension” with Russian commanders as exhausted forces were likely to be thrown into battle fairly soon in an attempt to gain ground in the east. The new focus on the east follows the humiliating failure of Putin’s original apparent plan to seize the capital, Kyiv, overthrow the government of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and to subjugate most of Ukraine in a matter of days of weeks. Instead, Russian troops who advanced on Kyiv were forced to withdraw to Belarus after shattering losses. The Kremlin has also pulled its forces out of the Sumy region after its advance there was bogged down. Revised estimates are that 29 of Russia’s battalion tactical groups – the smallest operating unit of its forces – are now “combat non-effective”, from an invading force estimated to be at about 125 battalions – roughly 75% of Russia’s total army. Nato and western analysts believe Russia is now determined to consolidate its gains in the south and south-east, with the Kremlin “reshaping its narrative” so it can redefine its idea of victory. It already controls a land corridor stretching from Mariupol along the sea of Azov to the southern Kherson province and to Crimea. Its next targets appear to be the strategic towns of Sloviansk, which Russian forces and separatists held in 2014, Kramatorsk and Sievierodonetsk. Any assault is likely to run into major resistance from the Ukrainian army. Ukraine’s military, however, have not so far been able to reinforce their own forces in the Donbas, said one western official, because they are still attempting to secure areas retaken from Russian troops, and need to defend Kyiv against any surprise attempt to retake the capital. Russia has stepped up its attacks from strongholds in the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, occupied for eight years by pro-Kremlin separatists. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the Ukrainian-controlled area of Donetsk oblast said on Wednesday there had been intensive enemy shelling. Ten high-rise buildings in Sievierodonetsk were shelled and on fire, he said. Russian troops also attacked the city of Vuhldar, south-west of Donetsk. A Russian war plane bombed an aid distribution point, Kyrylenko said. Two civilians were killed and five wounded. Photos from the scene showed two women lying motionless in the street. One had lost her left leg; the other was sprawled on her back, arms flung to her side. There were blood stains on a wall and shattered windows. Kyrylenko said the Russian “fascists” responsible “will not be forgiven”. Serhiy Haidai, the head of the Luhansk regional military administration, predicted Russian offensive was likely to start “in three to four days”, once they had relocated reserves. “We are observing the constant arrival of new forces, both equipment and personnel” he said, emphasising that Ukraine’s armed forces were ready to fight back. About 30,000 civilians are still in frontline Lysychansk, with a smaller number in Sievierodonetsk, he said. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said Putin’s long-term goal was still to occupy all of Ukraine. He said the international community had to be realistic and understand Russia’s war and invasion could go on for “many months or even years”. Western leaders expressed further outrage at the massacres of civilians in the garden suburb of Bucha north-west of Kyiv, as fears grew for the inhabitants of other occupied towns and cities. Boris Johnson said the images of Ukrainians shot from close range with their hands tied together did not “look far short of genocide”. Given what Putin was doing in Ukraine, “it is no wonder people are responding in the way that they are”, he said, promising further UK sanctions. According to Ukraine’s human rights ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova, more than 400 residents have gone missing from the town of Hostomel, in the Kyiv region. She said witnesses had told her some had been killed during 35 days of Russian occupation. The Kremlin has called allegations that its soldiers committed war crimes in Bucha and elsewhere a “monstrous forgery”. Satellite images, however, show multiple bodies lying on the streets well before Russian troops pulled out and headed north. Meanwhile, about 500 people have made it out of the besieged port city of Mariupol in a convoy of buses and private cars, organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). They are now at the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia. “It’s a huge relief for hundreds of people who have suffered immensely and are now in a safer location. It’s clear, though, that thousands more civilians trapped inside Mariupol need safe passage out and aid to come in,” Pascal Hundt, the ICRC’s head of delegation in Ukraine, said. The ICRC team had tried for five days and four nights to reach Mariupol, coming within 12 miles of the city, but security conditions had made it impossible to enter. Ukrainian officials said the Russian military had pounded the city over the past 24 hours, with 118 airstrikes. They also said Russian soldiers were gathering bodies in order to destroy evidence of Bucha-style war crimes. A mobile crematorium was going from street to street, collecting and disposing of corpses from people killed by shelling and shooting. In its latest assessment, the Ministry of Defence said the humanitarian situation in Mariupol was deteriorating. “More than 160,000 remaining residents have no light, communication, medicine, heat or water. Russian forces have prevented humanitarian access, likely to pressure defenders to surrender,” it said.",News/World news,Ukraine urges civilians in east to flee ‘while opportunity still exists’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/ukraine-urges-civilians-in-east-to-flee-while-opportunity-still-exists
4/7/2022,"Last September, Boris Johnson broke a manifesto pledge by announcing a 1.25 percentage point rise in national insurance contributions. On Wednesday, that extra deduction from pay packets took effect, albeit with an important adjustment. In last month’s spring statement, the chancellor raised the threshold at which national insurance is paid from £9,800 to £12,570 – cancelling the tax hike for around 70% of workers. That gives the lie to Mr Johnson’s previous claim that the rise was a “health and social care levy” with just under £12bn in receipts strictly hypothecated for those causes. The pledge of increased spending stands. It will be covered not by a “levy” but from general exchequer receipts, as was bound to be the case. To meet that and other spending obligations, the overall tax burden is rising towards its highest level since the 1940s. This is achieved by stealth, since Rishi Sunak wants to be known as a tax-cutting chancellor. He has scheduled an income tax cut for 2024. The prospect of an election that year is more relevant to the timing than any thought of fiscal sustainability, but that is true of every aspect of government policy. The “health and social care levy” label was itself a sleight of hand to make a short-term electoral expedient sound like a long-term strategy. Confronted with a huge backlog of treatments in an NHS strained by the pandemic, the prime minister faced a choice between breaking a manifesto commitment midterm and fighting for re-election with the health service on its knees. He chose the former, while using social care as camouflage. Since financing the needs of an ageing population is widely recognised to be a thorny and perennial policy problem, the claim to be grappling with it at last helped deflect the backlash from the broken tax promise. In reality, the crisis of social care funding is unsolved. That was made clear in a largely unremarked vote in the House of Lords earlier this week. Peers voted to include local authority contributions in totals spent within the cap that is meant to protect people from open-ended financial liability for social care. The government had tried to exclude council help from the calculation, meaning more people would have to pay much more from their own pockets before reaching the point of protection under the cap. The bill under dispute is now caught in legislative “ping pong” between the two chambers of parliament. It is a technical issue pointing to a wider problem – the government is not being straight with people about the complexity of the social care challenge and the collective financial adjustments that society has to make to meet it. Instead, Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak are engaged in an increasingly elaborate game of smoke and mirrors to raise revenue while pretending to cut taxes and brand it all in terms that work for a Tory re-election bid. Wednesday’s national insurance changes are the emblem of that approach. The economic outlook and political context may have changed since the “levy” was announced; the government’s dishonesty on the matter is constant.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on tax and social care: an honesty deficit | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/06/the-guardian-view-on-tax-and-social-care-an-honesty-deficit
4/7/2022,"On Tuesday, when the board of the Reserve Bank kept the cash rate at 0.1%, it marked the 137th month without a rate rise. And yet the markets still anticipate a rise in the coming months, but soaring house prices mean it is very unlikely that rates will rise as high as the market currently expects. November 2010 is starting to get to that point where you realise it is actually a long time ago. It was so long ago that Ash Barty had just turned professional at the age of 14 but was still a year away from playing in her first grand slam tournament. It was also the last time the Reserve Bank raised the cash rate – from 4.50% to 4.75%. Since then, it has all been down. Thus in the time Barty began to play tennis professionally, retire, come back, win three grand slam tournaments, become No 1 and then retire again, the Reserve Bank has not once raised interest rates. If the graph does not display please click here In that time a total of 1,159,402 first-home buyer owner-occupier loans have been taken out. They should all get ready to experience something new. Because inflation is rising faster than expected, and because the worst of the pandemic lockdowns and restrictions are behind, and because a 0.1% cash rate is not normal, the market expects rates to rise. Tuesday’s announcement not to increase the rate ironically increased this expectation, mostly because the RBA governor’s statement left out one word – “patient”. The governor’s statement usually ends with a line saying (as it did last month): “The Board is prepared to be patient as it monitors how the various factors affecting inflation in Australia evolve.” This month, however the statement ended with “The Board will assess this and other incoming information as its sets policy to support full employment in Australia and inflation outcomes consistent with the target.” If you are reading those two sentences and don’t see the big deal, worry not – just thank yourself you don’t work in a job that has to pretend such things actually do matter. Currency traders go through the governor’s statement looking for any changes that might – like this one does – have them thinking a rate rise is coming sooner than later. But wow, have they got excited about rate rises. At the start of this year the market anticipated by the middle of next year the cash rate would be up to 1.25%; now it expects it to hit that by October and by August next year it will be all the way up to 3.25% – a level it has not been since 2012. If the graph does not display please click here To me, that seems very exuberant. It would be a rise of 325 basis points in little over a year. If that were to happen, either we have just experienced the greatest economic boom since federation and wages are growing by well over 4%, or we are now in a massive recession caused by the Reserve Bank doing what the market expected despite an economy just bumping along. To give you some context, during the mining boom it took 71 months for the RBA to raise the cash rate 300 basis points from 4.25% in April 2002 to 7.25% in March 2008. The market’s current expectation of rate rises compared to that is a trifle absurd: If the graph does not display please click here Not only is the pace absurd, but so too is the level. A 3.25% cash rate would effectively see the current average discount mortgage rate go from 3.45% to around 6.6%. But such a rate would be rather more detrimental than in 2012 when the rate was last that high. It would actually be the most crushing rate we’ve experienced since 1990s’ 17% rates. The reason is that house prices and mortgages have grown massively but household incomes have not. In January 2012, when the average mortgage rate was 6.69%, the average new mortgage in NSW was $399,270 and monthly repayments for a 30-year loan of $2,462, compared with an average loan now of $754,800 and repayments of $3,369. So mortgage size has increased 89% but, because of lower interest rates, the loan repayments have increased only around 32%. In that time the median income of someone living in NSW (using the measure of average full-time male earnings plus 33% of average women’s earnings) has also increased 30%. That means the share of income going towards mortgage repayment is slightly higher now, but not by much. But should interest rates go up the share of income going to pay your mortgage skyrockets. The cash rate of 1.5% would see monthly repayments for the current average loan go up by $615 a month – and the share of income going toward the mortgage would be equivalent to the level it was in 2008 when the RBA increased the cash rate to 7.25%: If the graph does not display please click here Because of soaring house prices, the Reserve Bank does not need to raise the cash rate by as much as in the past to have a similar impact. This means a 3% cash rate, let alone one next year, would likely destroy the economy and the housing market as people would be forced to spend nearly half of their income just to pay their mortgage. That is not something that would help the economy in any way.

4/7/2022,"Zoë Coombs Marr’s character Dave has woken from a coma and everything since 2016 is new to him. He has missed the MeToo movement, JK Rowling’s pivot from beloved to controversial, the entire pandemic, thousands of new cultural references. Coombs Marr’s new show, The Opener, asks, how would Dave respond to all of that? What would this caricature of a hack male comedian have to say about “cancel culture”? The Opener begins with Coombs Marr explaining that she was asked this question at a dinner party, and felt compelled to create a show that answered it. Performing a “pre-show chat” in her dressing gown, she sets out the context: in 2014 she created Dave, in order to parody the blokey, toxic masculinity that she’d seen again and again in comedy. Dave was both a comment on how alienated Coombs Marr felt entering the stand-up scene and a way to address it by shielding herself behind performance. Having performed as herself since 2016, after her award-winning run of Trigger Warning, Coombs Marr clearly relishes returning to Dave. As he’s warming up, Dave jokes that he has missed being on stage, but it is clear that Coombs Marr has too. We see more than just glimpses of his creator peeking through; “Zoë” is a character within the show just as much as Dave is. At times, her voice speaks from the rafters to help direct the show. She interrupts Dave’s routine, sneaking in her own jokes between his. Dave stops multiple times when his own material veers outside his voice, asking out loud why he is speaking more as the “angry lesbian” inside him. I’ll admit I also wondered sometimes why he was the one telling these jokes. In the moments when the show deals most directly with its subject matter, it feels more like Zoë’s voice we are hearing. Zoë is the one who addresses the slap at the Academy Awards and Louis CK winning a Grammy. Both these events speak so directly to what the show is about, it would be odd not to mention them – but both also happened in the last 10 days. Not only is Dave catching up after waking from a coma, Coombs Marr is catching up to the news cycle, trying to parody a culture that gets more toxic with every awards show. While this tries to be a tightly structured hour of comedy, the seams are still showing in many places. A lot has happened while Dave has been in a coma, but a lot has also happened in the months since Coombs Marr began trialling this show earlier in the year. It is little wonder then, that The Opener lacks the polish I’ve come to expect from her shows. When it works, the relationship between Zoë and Dave is the highlight. Trigger Warning saw Dave realise he is a character; The Opener sees him find comfort in that identity, with Zoë as a collaborator rather than nemesis. They discuss the flaws in his motivation, grapple with sharing the same body and even workshop his pronouns. This is a Dave that feels more settled in himself. Despite its faults, this is still a show worth seeing. Coombs Marr’s absurdist and theatrical approach to stand up is refreshing. And The Opener is full of great jokes: it is difficult to craft the type of tight one liners that you’ll find here. They are clever and sharp and made me gasp with laughter. Few do it better than Coombs Marr, who is excellent at what she does, combining her theatre background with a love of jokes to produce surreal and deeply silly comedy. Dave was what shot her into the limelight and helped her cement a place within the Australian comedy scene – but since he’s been gone, she’s also cemented a place without him. There is joy in seeing Dave again, but it is the glimpses of Zoë where this show shines. While Dave insists he came back because he was needed, I’m not sure Coombs Marr needs him anymore.

4/7/2022,"Anthony Albanese has called on the Australian government to expel Russian diplomats, declaring that the “sickening abuses being carried out by Russian forces” in Ukraine must trigger immediate consequences. In a pre-election attempt to get on the front foot on national security, the Labor leader said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, must act in lockstep with European partners by ordering a number of Russian diplomats and staff to leave. Under the model suggested by Albanese, the Russian ambassador to Australia, Alexey Pavlovsky, would probably be able to remain in place, but some of his subordinates would be declared “persona non grata”, forcing them to depart the country. It is possible Albanese’s call for action pre-empts an imminent government decision. Government sources told Guardian Australia on Wednesday that expulsions of diplomats had “always been on the table” and the latest reports of atrocities by Russian forces would be taken into account. A number of European countries have now acted in response to the murder of civilians in the town of Bucha, north of Kyiv, which the German government has described as war crimes. Since Monday, 206 Russian diplomats and embassy staff have been told they are no longer welcome to stay by governments in Italy, France, Germany and elsewhere. Albanese called on the Morrison government to “follow suit”. He cited previous comments by the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, that the option of expulsions was being kept “under review … at the highest levels of the government”. “It is hard to conceive how the decision can be made to allow these individuals to stay, given the sickening abuses being carried out by Russian forces,” Albanese said in a statement late on Wednesday. “The mass killing of innocent civilians and the use of rape as a weapon of war can only be described as war crimes.” Albanese said those responsible must be held to account “and in the first instance there must be immediate diplomatic consequences”. He said Labor also supported “all efforts to ensure these crimes are thoroughly investigated and prosecuted through the international criminal court process, including the provision of Australian experts to assist the investigation”. Payne was in Brussels to attend meeting with Nato foreign ministers on Wednesday. Prior to leaving Australia, Payne said the talks would help coordinate “the global response to Russia’s unlawful, egregious and unprovoked actions”. To date, the Australian government has stopped short of expelling Russian diplomats in order to keep open direct lines of communication. But in its attempts to ratchet up the costs on Russia for the invasion of Ukraine, Australia has typically acted in line with the US and Europe. The raft of diplomatic expulsions in Europe suggest that a similar action could soon be considered by Australia. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Russia has denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians and described the expulsions from European countries as “a blow to bilateral relations”, warning such moves would trigger “retaliatory measures”. The Coalition is eager to make national security a major theme in its pitch to voters, with Morrison arguing the world faces “uncertain times” and it is not a time for “weakness”. Morrison is expected to see the governor general within days to call an election for either 14 or 21 May. Over the past week, he has labelled the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, “the war criminal of Moscow” and has said he is “appalled by reports of atrocities against Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops in Bucha and other towns”. Appalled by reports of atrocities against Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops in Bucha and other towns. The targeting of innocent civilians and civilian infrastructure are war crimes.

4/7/2022,"The sale and promotion of e-cigarettes to young people must be banned by governments, the Australian Council on Smoking and Health says, following the most comprehensive review yet of vaping harms. The review, led by researchers from the Australian National University Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, found there was conclusive evidence that e-cigarettes caused poisoning, injuries, burns and immediate toxicity through inhalation, including seizures. Their use also led to addiction. The review, funded by the federal health department, found there was also conclusive evidence e-cigarettes caused less serious health impacts such as throat irritation and nausea. “E-cigarettes cause acute lung injury,” the review, which was published on Thursday, states. “Among smokers, there is moderate evidence that use of e-cigarettes increases heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and arterial stiffness acutely after use.” The review found there was strong evidence that e-cigarettes increased tobacco smoking uptake in non-smokers, particularly young people, while there was limited evidence that nicotine e-cigarettes help smokers quit cigarettes. The 430-page review was led by the epidemiologist and public health physician Prof Emily Banks. She and her team analysed evidence from 189 studies on the health impacts of e-cigarettes. Previously, there was no systematic review drawing together the existing evidence of the health effects of e-cigarettes. The researchers were especially interested in whether nicotine and non-nicotine vaping products led to dependence, cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease, oral diseases, reproductive outcomes, injuries and poisonings, mental health conditions, and environmental hazards with human health implications. “The evidence is there for some of the risks, but for most major health outcomes, like cancer, cardiovascular disease and mental illness, we don’t know what the impacts of e-cigarettes are,” Banks said. “Their safety for these outcomes hasn’t been established.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Despite this, there were “myths” around e-cigarettes depicted in advertising and promotion of the products targeting young people, she said, including “the false ideas that vapes wouldn’t be widely available if they were dangerous and ‘it’s just water vapour’”. “Vapes deliver hundreds of chemicals – some of them known to be toxic and many others with unknown effects,” Banks said. “In Australia, over 2 million people have used e-cigarettes. Use is more common among youth, particularly young males, and among smokers and the majority is not for the purposes of smoking cessation. Vaping is causing addiction in a new generation of users. “Young non-smokers who vape are around three times as likely to take up smoking than non-vapers. Nicotine use in children and adolescents can lead to lifelong addiction issues as well as difficulties in concentration and learning. “Vaping is also illegal [in Australia] if it isn’t on prescription.” Australia’s drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), has been cracking down on the illegal advertising of vaping products in recent months. A health department spokesperson told Guardian Australia that since 1 October 2021, 49 infringement notices – totalling $450,216 – had been issued to companies and individuals. That included 41 infringement notices for alleged breaches of the advertising requirements and eight infringement notices for alleged import offences. “Whilst the TGA hasn’t seen companies explicitly marketing their products to children, disposable nicotine brands are using tactics that may attract children and young adults, such as the use of brightly coloured packaging or a range of flavours,” the spokesperson said. “The TGA has received a small number of adverse event reports related to nicotine vaping products. To date, a pattern of increased reporting has not been identified; however, as an unapproved product, it is expected that many adverse events may not be reported to the TGA.” The Australian Council on Smoking and Health chief executive, Maurice Swanson, said “schools across Australia are being swamped by e-cigarettes”. “Relying solely on education programs for parents and children is a failed strategy,” he said. “A comprehensive approach including new legislation to prohibit the sale, supply and promotion of e-cigarettes on social media platforms is required.” The Cancer Council’s public health committee chair, Anita Dessaix, said the ANU report was the most comprehensive study of the health impacts of e-cigarettes ever published. It should send an urgent message to Australian governments, she said. “Every week we’re hearing growing community concern about e-cigarettes in schools, the health harms and the risks of smoking uptake among young people,” Dessaix said. “A public health crisis is rapidly unfolding before our eyes. These findings send a clear message to all governments: act now.”",News/Society,Call to ban vaping for young Australians after review concludes it causes ‘acute lung injury’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/07/call-to-ban-vaping-for-young-australians-after-review-concludes-it-causes-acute-lung-injury

There is, however, a more cynical explanation for selling off the broadcaster at this time. Boris Johnson’s government faces an election within the next two years. Channel 4 News has provided some of the most robust scrutiny of government policy throughout its existence. This is something Johnson cannot tolerate. He has no doubt seen how Victor Orbán has, through media manipulation, constitutional trashing and restricting protest, steered Hungary towards a democracy in name only.

It must be resisted by a mass public movement. Channel 4 is the only real alternative source of news, views and culture; selling it impoverishes the nation.
