4/28/2022,"Imran Ahmad Khan has said he has now resigned as Wakefield’s MP and will no longer be a parliamentarian from this Saturday, two and a half weeks after being found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. Ahmad Khan told the Guardian he had submitted his resignation on Monday and that it was effective from 30 April. That means he will be paid his salary in full for April. The Conservative party will then choose a date for a byelection, which will probably take place in late June, after the jubilee bank holidays and local elections. The Treasury has received his resignation letter, the Guardian understands. Ahmad Khan, elected in 2019 as Wakefield’s first Conservative MP since 1932, announced his intention to step down in a tweet on 14 April, four days after being convicted at Southwark crown court. He quit after the Guardian confronted him with fresh claims about propositioning a 16-year-old boy to have oral sex and go to a hotel with him and a sex worker to take cocaine and have sex. Ahmad Khan insists he informed the parliamentary authorities straight away but that there were delays because of the Easter bank holidays and then while he sorted out HR issues with his staff. “There is no legal procedure to resign from the house without getting a crown appointment,” he said, referring to an arcane parliamentary procedure dating back to 1624 that decrees that MPs cannot directly resign their seat. Instead, they have to apply to the Treasury to be made crown steward and bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds or crown steward and bailiff of the manor of Northstead, both non-salaried positions, until their replacement is elected. The Treasury normally issues a statement on the day the resignation comes into force. Ahmad Khan said he had forward-dated his resignation to Saturday because the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which regulates and administers the pay and pensions of MPs and their staff, had told him to do so. “Ipsa and HR have said there’s five days from when you give [your resignation] to clear out the office and so on, for logistical and practical reasons, and also for staff reasons,” he said. But a parliamentary source said: “MPs can resign at a moment’s notice. Look at Owen Paterson. He was there one minute and gone the next. MPs choose the date. There is a winding-up process for an MP’s office, to do with members of staff who suddenly find themselves without a job, and also to do with the transfer of secure material. But that is separate to when an MP actually stands down. By waiting until the end of the month it means he will have been paid in full for April.” When he announced his intention to resign, Ahmad Khan said he was going to appeal against his conviction and would “focus entirely on clearing my name”. The Crown Prosecution Service said it had not yet been notified of any application from Khan to appeal. He has 28 days from the date of his conviction, 11 April, to apply for leave to appeal. He is due to be sentenced on 23 May.",News/Politics,Imran Ahmad Khan completes MP resignation process with full April pay,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/imran-ahmad-khan-mp-completes-resignation-process
4/28/2022,"The prominent football agent Mino Raiola has tweeted to say he is alive, in response to multiple reports in Italy and then rehashed across other European media outlets that he had died. The Italy-born Dutch national, one of football’s most powerful and high-earning agents, tweeted: “Current health status for the ones wondering: pissed off second time in 4 months they kill me. Seem also able to ressuscitate [sic].” His statement came after Dr Alberto Zangrillo from San Raffaele hospital in Milan told the news agency Ansa: “I’m outraged by the phone calls from pseudo-journalists speculating on the life of a man who is fighting to survive.” Current health status for the ones wondering: pissed off second time in 4 months they kill me. Seem also able to ressuscitate. Raiola, whose clients include Paul Pogba, Erling Haaland and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, is understood to have been living with a serious illness since January. A tweet from Raiola’s official account in January said he had undergone medical checks requiring anaesthesia, but that he had not had emergency surgery.Raiola was born in Italy but grew up in the Netherlands, and first stepped into the world of football agency by working on the deal that took the Dutch forward Bryan Roy to Foggia, before acting as an interpreter in Dennis Bergkamp’s move from Ajax to Internazionale. Czech star Pavel Nedved became Raiola’s first big-name client, and he has steadily built his reputation in Italian and world football over the years since. Raiola’s often outspoken approach has not always endeared him to club managers, with the former Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjær unhappy at what he saw as the Italian stirring up trouble over Pogba’s future. Pogba and Haaland are expected to make two of this summer’s most significant transfers, with the Frenchman available on a free when his contract at United ends and Haaland poised to leave Borussia Dortmund.

4/28/2022,"Eddie Hearn and Jane Couch could hardly be more different but they are united this week by a shared disbelief and delight. As we approach the landmark moment on Saturday night when Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano step into the ring at Madison Square Garden in New York to contest the most significant and lucrative fight in the history of women’s boxing, the promoter and the pioneer sound relieved and ecstatic. Twenty-four years ago Couch won her case against the British Boxing Board of Control when the high court ruled that she should become the first woman in the UK to be granted a licence to box professionally. Until then the BBBC had banned women from the ring on the basis that they were too frail and “emotionally unstable” to box, owing to their menstrual cycle. Three years later, in October 2001, Katie Taylor fought in the first officially sanctioned women’s boxing match in Ireland. She was just 15. Taylor and Serrano will now feature in a riveting bout as they become the first female boxers to both earn more than $1m in one night – and the first women to headline the Garden as fighters. In another unlikely double act, Hearn is co-promoting the contest with the YouTube star Jake Paul. The Essex promoter listens quietly in a swanky lounge on West 35th Street, just a few blocks from the most famous arena in boxing, as I tell him a story about the days when his dad, Barry, was shocked to hear Couch had not been paid for a fight. It makes us feel that, after decades of prejudice and pain, women’s boxing has finally been transformed. Talking to me on the phone from England, Couch says of Taylor and Serrano’s historic bout: “I can’t believe it, but it’s brilliant. I’m so glad this day has come.” For Hearn, meanwhile, “this promotion keeps surprising me. The first surprise was when we sat down with Madison Square Garden and their management said: ‘We have to get this fight.’ That was special. Then they said: ‘We have to put it in the big arena.’ I knew we could go to Hulu [the smaller theatre, seating 5,600 inside the Garden] and sell it out in a day. I’m known for being aggressive but, at the same time, I’m quietly conservative to ensure the right business decisions. “They were so confident and there was also this feeling that we need to make this a significant moment in sport. When tickets went on sale it was the second-fastest pre-sale in the history of the Garden. We’ve had more media requests for this one than for some AJ [Anthony Joshua] fights. This is more than boxing media. It’s Bloomberg, CNN, the Today Show.” On Tuesday morning, on that NBC network television programme which epitomises mainstream America and normally never features boxing, Taylor and Serrano were interesting and respectful guests. They reflected on the magnitude of a contest for Taylor’s undisputed world lightweight titles which is full of jeopardy for both of them. They also spoke about their Irish and Puerto Rican backgrounds. Later that day, with Hearn and Paul, they engaged in a classy face-off at the top of the Empire State Building. “That blew my socks off,” Hearn says, “because, until then, I didn’t know what they were planning to do with the lights on Saturday night. They told me they were lighting up the Empire State and I said: ‘What do you mean?’ They said: ‘We’re lighting up the building with the flags of Ireland and Puerto Rico.’ I like to pretend now that it was my idea.” When I last interviewed Couch in 2019, the now 53-year-old told me how boxing had “damaged” her. She cried as she described the personal and psychological cost of being the revolutionary who made women’s boxing legal in Britain. “I still feel it,” Couch admits, “because it was actually cruel what [the boxing authorities and promoters] did to me. The more I look at it the more I think: ‘Why couldn’t I have got the right manager or trainer to look after me like they’re looking after the girls now?’ But someone had to be the first and it was me. It just wasn’t my time.” Yet there is a sense of achievement for Couch because, during 39 pro bouts, she boxed on the undercard of some great fighters – from Lennox Lewis and Vitali Klitschko to Roy Jones Jr and Naseem Hamed. In 2003 she also went the distance in Los Angeles with the formidable Lucia Rijker, the Dutch fighter who never lost in the professional ring. Couch is emphatic that, had she been given a proper platform, Rijker could have matched the impact of Taylor and Serrano. “One hundred per cent. She had such power – like [the British middleweight] Savannah Marshall has now. I never had any power. I was just a tough, come forward fighter. I either won or lost on points and I fought with my face.” Couch had great courage and she won a version of the world title, but she did not get paid for many of her bouts. When I ask if Barry Hearn had been interested in women’s boxing Couch says: “No, but he co-promoted the bill when Prince Naseem fought Augie Sanchez in Connecticut [in August 2000]. I was on the undercard and Barry and Emanuel Steward [the brilliant American trainer] were having breakfast in Foxwoods Casino. I went: ‘Hiya!’ They’re like: ‘Oh, hi Jane.’ I told them I was boxing but I wasn’t getting paid. Barry said: ‘You’re a professional boxer. You’ve got to get paid.’ So he gave me some money. I think it was $500. He said: ‘I’m not allowing you to box for free.’ But I had actually agreed to box for free because it would raise the profile of women boxing.” It’s very different now and Eddie Hearn admits: “Before we started working with Katie my dad thought women shouldn’t box. That’s the same for Frank Warren, Bob Arum and all those old-school promoters. It’s got the stigma of a tough, rough man’s sport. It was only the changing perception of women’s sport in general that opened the door to Katie. But I’ve learnt from Katie that broadcasters were looking to use women’s sport as a box-ticker. She taught me that’s wrong. Box-ticking is not equality.” After he reaches for his phone to read me the direct message she sent him on 3 October 2016, when Taylor asked if he was interested in promoting her, Hearn remembers her pro debut a month later. “I put her on as a main event at Wembley and everyone took the piss and said: ‘What are you doing? It’s embarrassing. Putting a women’s fight as the main event?’ We got about 3,000, mainly Irish fans, at Wembley Arena, and she was unbelievable. “She fought like a Mexican. She was doubling up to the body, left hook to the head, switching. After it was over everyone, including my dad, went: ‘Fucking hell.’ I knew then you’ve got to give her the platform to convince people to watch. Back then 80% of the audience had already decided women’s boxing wasn’t for them. 10% were a little curious and the other 10% were believers already. Now that 80% of non-believers has gone down to probably 10%. I knew it would happen. Just let people see fighters like Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano and they’ll be convinced.” Promoting Taylor has been educational for Hearn. “I went to Katie about four years ago and said: ‘I’ve had a great idea. On International Women’s Day we’re going to do an all-female card at Madison Square Garden in the Hulu theatre. It’s going to be ground-breaking, blah blah blah.’ I was so excited. Katie went: ‘No way.’ She looked at me like she was disgusted. She taught me the only way that we would have a sustainable future with women’s boxing was for it to become a stand-alone product as a great sport – not as a token of goodwill. If it stands alone, and has its own value, then we have longevity and sustainability. “That’s what Katie Taylor has built. She and Serrano are not selling out the Garden [with a 17,500 capacity] because everyone is going: ‘We should support women’s sport.’ It’s selling out the Garden because it’s a great fight.” Hearn leans back in his chair and smiles. “I remember one other thing I said to Katie: ‘Imagine making $1m at Madison Square Garden in a headline bout.’ I just said it as a salesman line. And now we’re here.” A long way from New York city, the pain in Jane Couch has eased a little this week. During our last interview she had said: “It hurts my pride to talk this openly but I don’t think people realise the damage they did. Most of them had never met me and they’d call me a lesbian or a freak.” She suffered depression and panic attacks and only began her first “proper” relationship at the age of 41. But now, as Couch counts down the hours until she and her partner, Brian, can watch the fight on Saturday, she says: “All the girls, Katie and Amanda, Savannah and Claressa Shields, are doing a brilliant job. I couldn’t represent women’s boxing how they represent it. I didn’t have the media training or even the personality they do. It’s just brilliant what’s happening in New York this week. I feel massively proud.”",Sport/Sport,‘I’m so glad this day has come’: women’s boxing’s journey to headlining Madison Square Garden,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/28/womens-boxing-madison-square-garden-katie-taylor-amanda-serrano
4/28/2022,"Playwright Chloë Moss grew up watching container ships passing by the windows of her house near the Seaforth docks in Liverpool. Decades later, when she returned to live up the road from her childhood home, she found herself once again mesmerised by these vast, faceless vessels. When she was a child, her mother told her bedtime fairy stories about the men who went to sea, but any lingering sense of romance about the lives of the sailors working on board was comprehensively stamped out during the four years of research she undertook before writing her new play, Corrina, Corrina. The confined, claustrophobic environment of a cargo ship offers such a perfect setting for a thriller, it seems remarkable that playwrights have not previously chosen to locate their scripts within these rigidly hierarchical surroundings. Audiences will quickly discover that life on board is streaked with misogyny, racism, exploitation and violence, but these are problems that have very rarely attracted much attention because shipping industry news rarely makes the front page. “It’s such an invisible industry,” Moss says, speaking over Zoom during a break on day three of rehearsals in Liverpool. “It’s kind of blindly ignored, which is very strange considering that something like 90% of everything you own has come in via a ship. There is no capitalism without the shipping industry – it’s huge.” Her play centres on a young woman, Corrina, who arrives at Felixstowe docks to take up a job as a junior officer on a ship about to embark for Singapore. The only woman on board, she is caught between the British senior staff and rest of the crew, mainly made up of badly paid men from the Philippines, who spend protracted periods away from their families. “The ship in the play is a microcosm of society,” says Moss. “You’ve got the old white guy in charge, the captain, and then the badly exploited workers at the bottom of the pile.” Corrina is trying to navigate her way through the complex power dynamics, determined to hold her own. She begins quietly self-assured and grows angrier and more powerful as the play progresses, and as the insuperable nature of the male-dominated structures around her sinks in. Moss’s research was painstaking. She worked with the charity Kanlungan, which supports Filipino migrant workers, to understand the difficulties they face. She toured a container ship; contacted the maritime trade union Nautilus International; attended female seafarers’ conferences; and interviewed lots of female cadets. She was particularly startled by the amount of abuse women endure during their work. “Women make up around 1% of the shipping industry,” she says, “so, most likely, if you’re a woman on a cargo ship, you’re going to be the only woman on board. I didn’t speak to one female seafarer who hadn’t had directly been affected by sexual harassment or sexual violence. There wasn’t one. You can’t really get a clearer manifestation of patriarchy than on board a cargo ship.” While she was researching, Moss was very struck by the story of Akhona Geveza, a 19-year-old South African cadet who disappeared while she was working on a cargo ship in 2010. Geveza said she had been raped by a senior crew member, and when this was reported to the captain, he set up a three-way meeting between Geveza and her attacker, as if it was a personnel matter that could be resolved through mediation; she did not turn up for the meeting, and her body was found off the Croatian coast three days later. “It was just ruled a suicide. It was unbelievable, and one of the root problems is that the captain is God on a ship. So however he decides to deal with it is how it gets dealt with. It’s the law of the captain,” Moss says. Because ships are usually in international waters, the legal jurisdiction can be uncertain. “You’ve got flags of convenience, where shipowners register a ship to one country, usually one that lacks laws around working conditions and wage protection. And you’ve got a multinational crew who are heading from one side of the world to the other, through international waters where there is no jurisdiction. The big question is: who takes responsibility for any crime that happens? And the answer is usually nobody.” Corrina’s story is not Geveza’s story, but there are common threads. Moss’s heroine, like the South African cadet, is encouraged to go to sea as part of an equal opportunities campaign, designed to increase the proportion of women working in the industry. When Corrina tries to report abuse, a similar three-way encounter is set up by her captain, a man who thinks he is progressive on matters of equality. It does not go well. “I’m not suggesting for a moment that people shouldn’t be held accountable, but my priority is ensuring that we always move forward,” the captain says, cheerfully initiating an encounter between the attacker and his victim. “The best way to move forwards, I’m sure, working and living in such close proximity, is to discuss it openly in a safe space.” Moss has previously written plays for the Clean Break theatre company, which mostly focuses on prison themes, and her work has taken her frequently into the men’s prison estate, so she understands the feeling of going into an all-male environment. “You go into that space as a woman, you feel something in the air; it’s very palpable.” Woven into the drama is the Homeric legend of Scylla, a female sea monster with six heads and a tail. In Moss’s account, Scylla has been made into a monster and banished to the bottom of the sea by a controlling suitor. “After a few thousand years of this, she started to get angry, so she swam back up to the surface and went on a rampage, swallowing men on boats like there’s no tomorrow,” Corrina tells her fellow crew members, in explanation of her own rising fury. Moss’s play is, in part, the story of women who are “constantly having their own anger ignored, suppressed or dampened”. She explains: “Corrina begins by trying to assimilate, adopting a kind of masculinity and matching the men, trying to show that she has an armour. Later, it comes full circle as she takes things into her own hands to get justice. It’s really about the character tapping into her own anger.” The play is beautifully written and occasionally unexpectedly funny, despite the creeping tension. The role of the cargo ship is shown to be as fascinating as it is bizarre – slowly transporting shipments of random objects across the world, everything from containers carrying tens of thousands of plastic talking-and-singing dolls to yoga mats and smuggled guns. The sailors argue about the importance or pointlessness of their work. One sailor is accused of buying “things he doesn’t need with the money he gets from shipping the things nobody else needs all across the world”. “It’s called life, my friend,” he retorts. “Modern life. Life is good.” There is nothing here to make you want to head to the docks and sign up for this work. “It’s my idea of hell, to be stuck in that situation for weeks on end. You’ve got characters that literally can’t escape each other. One of the big problems for a dramatist is, when your characters are in conflict, how to keep them together, to keep on telling the story. The great thing about a ship is that they can’t go anywhere else.” Moss did not intend to write a thriller, and for a while she was a bit hesitant about allowing herself to describe her play as one. “It’s like saying you’ve written a comedy,” she says, pointing out that it feels a bit presumptuous to assume that the writing will achieve that effect. But the script has psychological tension, loneliness, power struggles, fear, violence and a constant threat of pirates, and it easily merits the description. “I’ve started describing it as a feminist thriller,” she says with a laugh. “I’m owning it now.” Corrina, Corrina, a Headlong and Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse co-production, plays the Everyman theatre, Liverpool, 17 May to 4 June.",Arts/Stage,‘It’s my idea of hell!’: the intense new play set aboard a cargo ship,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/28/chloe-moss-corinna-women-cargo-ship
4/28/2022,"There’s an instructive comparison to be made between the title of Let’s Eat Grandma’s third album and that of their debut. Released in 2016, the latter was called I, Gemini, which seemed to fit perfectly. The two 16-year-old schoolfriends who made it liked to present themselves like twins, or even aspects of the same person. They wore matching outfits and makeup. On stage, they occasionally performed with their long hair obscuring their faces so you couldn’t tell one from the other. Filled with songs ostensibly concerning mushrooms, fairytales and various childhood terrors, I, Gemini really seemed to be an album about the peculiarly intense friendships that develop among teens. With its unorthodox song structures, sudden diversions into rapping and abundance of instruments played in a way that suggested the duo prized exploration over virtuosity, it sounded like a spiffed-up version of something two talented and imaginative kids might tape together over long hours in a bedroom. With its impenetrable in-jokes expressed through lyrical non-sequiturs, listening to it sometimes felt like eavesdropping on a secret society of two. Their debut single Deep Six Textbook opened with the sound of Rosa Walton and Jenny Hollingworth playing a complex clapping game. Six years on, Two Ribbons is a title that suggests two separate entities that may or may not be entwined. And it is a markedly different album made in markedly different circumstances. After attempting to harness their debut’s weirdness to a more straightforward electronic approach on 2018’s Ivor Novello-nominated I’m All Ears, its successor is all-out pop: big, neon-hued synthesisers pitched somewhere between jubilant 80s hits and hands-in-the-air dancefloor breakdowns; acoustic ballads that swell to grand climaxes. The only real sonic connection with their debut is Hollingworth and Walton’s artless, untutored voices, although the fact that it feels striking hearing a pop song sung by someone who sounds like a human being perhaps says less about Let’s Eat Grandma than it does about the current state of pop. In 2019, on the eve of a US tour to promote I’m All Ears, Hollingworth’s boyfriend died of bone cancer aged 22. His death obviously impacts on Two Ribbons. There’s an instrumental called In the Cemetery; behind Watching You Go’s Giorgio Moroder-ish bass and upward-spiralling chorus lurks a song about the bewildering manifestations of grief, from insisting that life must go on as before (“I’m not staying in, I’m not wasting it, I’m not”) to longing for oblivion: “I want to shed myself and lay back in the earth sometimes,” Hollingworth sings. But it ultimately feels less like an album about death than about navigating the changing nature of friendship with age: the lessening of that intense early teen bond captured on I, Gemini, as the rest of life gets in the way: “We’re changing,” as Hollingworth sings on the title track, “like two ribbons, still woven, although we’re fraying.” It doesn’t automatically follow that two twentysomethings discussing the changing nature of their friendship should amount to compelling listening, but in this instance it does. That’s partly because the lyrics are really well written: on Levitation, Walton seems to describe the duo’s bond as “something glittering inside the drain”; “we both held on so tight we’re bruising up,” Hollingworth suggests later. But it’s also because – unlike a lot of left-field acts who attempt a swerve into pop – Let’s Eat Grandma have the tunes to back it up. Even when they were describing their sound as “experimental sludge-pop” and singing songs called Eat Shiitake Mushrooms, the duo had a strong melodic facility, clearly audible amid the honking saxes and frantically strummed mandolins. It feels sharper than ever here. The album offers a smorgasbord of Top 40 choruses and beautiful melodies, which makes the words more impactful. The album is ordered in a way that makes it sometimes feel like a conversation – a track by Walton addressing Hollingworth, then vice-versa. And there’s something really potent about hearing songs that tend to self-examination and a tone of hopeful resignation yet sound so jubilant overall – a variation on the old disco trick of setting downcast lyrics to euphoric music. At one point, Happy New Year literally explodes into fireworks, at odds with what’s being sung: “I’ve been thinking quite a lot about how I want the old us back.” Out of such strife has come a succession of songs that are immediate, powerful and involving. You listen to Two Ribbons willing the pair to work things out, as if you’re watching a particularly magnetic drama. “You know you’ll always be my best friend,” sings Walton at one point, “and look at what I made with you.” At that moment, she sounds like someone beaming with pride, and rightly so: Two Ribbons is a fabulous album.

4/28/2022,"This week has seen developments in two important legal battles. At stake is whether we are a society ruled by law or not. Without law, we face not survival of the fittest but survival of the fiercest – those most willing to use intimidation, force and violence to get their way. First, a New York judge held Donald Trump in contempt for stiffing a subpoena from the state attorney general, Letitia James, for documents relating to her civil investigation of the Trump Organization. She is investigating Trump’s businesses for allegedly inflating financial statements to lenders. Judges do not hold parties in contempt lightly. There needs to be an act so egregiously contemptuous of the law’s authority that a court cannot ignore it. In this case, the New York state court found team Trump’s efforts to locate documents in response to the New York attorney general’s subpoena “woefully insufficient” and showing complete disdain for the legal process. Trump was fined $10,000 for every day he continues in noncompliance. That court stood up for the rules that make our society work. Second, and on the same day, we saw evidence of attempts to destroy those rules that put allegiance to Trump above allegiance to country. New text messages – uncovered by the House committee investigating the January 6 siege of the Capitol, and disclosed by CNN – revealed the extent of rightwing Republicans’ attacks on the US constitution. The most striking text was an exchange from Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Republican congresswoman from Georgia. On 17 January, 11 days after the violent Capitol insurrection and three days before the scheduled transition of power to Joe Biden, she wrote: “In our private chat with only [House] Members several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call Marshall [sic] law.” She wasn’t referring to Thurgood Marshall. Nor was she referencing the former secretary of state George Marshall. Rather, she was referring to “martial law”, the use of the military to control all features of American life and to shut down our constitutional system of government. Greene was telling the then White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, that some Republican members of Congress were allegedly advocating to end the 225-year tradition of power transferring peacefully after elections and instead using force to keep the loser in office. By passing the idea along, she suggests she is willing to entertain it herself. Stop and think about that for a moment. Multiple elected federal officials sworn to uphold the constitution were contemplating abandoning it for the law of the jungle. We should not be so inured to extremism from the Republican right that such a text message fails to shock us. These texts take on an even more ominous cast when read together with emails disclosed by the January 6 committee’s recent legal filing in a civil suit Meadows brought to block the committee’s subpoenas. His meritless effort to rehash legal arguments already rejected by other courts is nothing more than a ploy to run out the clock, and the damaging evidence filed by the committee makes clear why. To pick but one example from almost 200 pages of exhibits, there is testimony that the secret service warned Meadows and others of the risk of January 6 violence, and they proceeded to discuss sending marchers to the Capitol. The evidence of efforts to overturn the election includes step-by-step plans which, taken together with yesterday’s texts, read like a recipe book for a coup, including all the ingredients and even the cooking instructions. For those on the American right who profess to believe in liberty, imposing martial law to put a strongman atop American government a la Putin should be unthinkable. But do not hold your breath waiting for outrage from the right over texts such as the one Greene was just revealed to have sent Meadows. Greene is a charter member of the anything-goes-for-Trump club. For its members, the end justifies any means. From ancient Greek democracy to the Roman republic to the French Revolution, history tells us again and again that gravitating to autocracy comes back to haunt a nation. As John Adams, signer of the declaration of independence and second president of the United States, wrote in 1775 to his wife, Abigail, “[A] Constitution of Government once changed from Freedom, can never be restored. Liberty once lost is lost forever.” This week, we were reminded again how close we came to a coup here in the US. Fortunately, a New York judge also showed us that the institutions of law remain strong and the impulse to autocracy is being held at bay.

4/28/2022,"On Tuesday, as Elon Musk just started to learn how difficult his new part-time job as owner of Twitter would be, he thought to tweet out a policy pronouncement about his new toy. “The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all,” Musk declared, either amused or annoyed by those of us who consider him dangerous or unworthy of running a major global communication platform that has been a tool for harassment, disinformation and conspiracy-theory promotion since its inception in 2006. An hour later, Musk appended that tweet with a mini-essay on the subject: “By ‘free speech,’ I simply mean that which matches the law. I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.” It’s unclear how Musk arrived at such a juvenile understanding of free speech or the law. He was raised in an authoritarian country, apartheid-era South Africa, and educated in Canada and the United States. So along the way one would assume he would have had something more than a dorm-room-level discussion about free speech. Like Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Musk seems never to have thought or read deeply about the subject. I feel bad for Twitter’s lawyers. Now they not only will have to keep an eye out for their corporate owner’s frequent Twitter malapropisms that could get him in trouble with the law (now his misbehavior might have a direct effect on the value of the company or some other aspect), they have to teach Musk the basics of law in the US and around the world. He’s not going to like what he learns. Europe, for instance, just announced a new law that would require Twitter and other platforms to perform serious diligence and make significant changes to restrict harmful expressions. India, the largest democracy in the world and the largest potential market for Twitter, aggressively censors critics of the government and of Hindu extremist movements. Championing “free speech” seemed to be Musk’s motivating principle as he mounted his campaign a few weeks ago to take over the platform that more than 400 million people use around the world. He has declared that Twitter is a “town square” in which speech should be unfettered by concerns about the propriety or consequences of that speech. Twitter is in no way a “town square”. Only town squares are town squares. They are public for a reason. And they are local. In America, they are supposed to be forums for open, unfettered expression. They have no rules of decorum. They have no interest in maintaining order to keep advertisers happy or their users comfortable. They are exceptional places. And they are non-commercial. Twitter, like every Starbucks, McDonalds, shopping center, and radio station, has other obligations and interests. Those spaces must maintain order, decorum, cleanliness, and comfort to keep revenue flowing and customers or audiences happy. That’s why the US constitution protects us only from the censorious power of government, not the needs of private entities to restrict expression that might harm their core missions. US law, Musk might be frustrated to learn, not only allows but encourages digital platforms to moderate the content that flows across them. Twitter is an advertising company. But it’s also a forum for expression. So its rules and design are, understandably, built to consider both the commercial and expressive desires of advertisers and users. That’s a difficult balance to maintain. No social media company has come close to protecting users and fully satisfying advertisers while also allowing for full range of expression in more than 100 languages around the world. Content moderation at a global scale is impossible to do well, but it can always be done better. Musk’s pledge to limit Twitter’s content moderation to that which the law of any nation demands leaves, in the US anyway, vast arrays of distracting, destructive, and dehumanizing expression able to flow freely to their targets. For years, women who have expressed themselves freely on Twitter have done so expecting and experiencing threats, the exposure of private information, and constant harassment. This phenomenon – one caused by the proliferation of expression – impedes the ability of millions of Twitter users to express themselves confidently and have their ideas taken seriously. Trolling is expression that crushes expression. It undermines the ability of groups of people to think collectively and productively about serious issues. Musk knows this. He’s the richest troll in the history of the world. And he’s frighteningly unserious. Some Musk fans have found their accounts suspended for violating clear Twitter rules against, for instance, deadnaming and misgendering transgender people. Musk himself has mocked the practice of clarifying one’s preferred pronouns. If Musk understood the real value of speech – to deliberate deeply and respectfully to work through differences and arrive either at solid truth claims or preferred paths of action – he would understand that granting trans people respect, allowing them to participate in conversations that do not get swamped back into facile interrogations of their “choices” and identities, enhances the diversity and quality of public conversation. Respecting the humanity and dignity of others makes everyone more free to discuss and debate issues seriously, deeply and calmly. If Musk acts rashly and recklessly, as is his modus operandi, he will undo the work of Twitter employees who have strived and struggled these past few years to make the experience of using Twitter more comfortable and safe. While these workers have done much, there is so much more work to do. Even today Twitter is infected by anti-vaccine accounts spreading dangerous claims and thus endangering public health during a deadly global pandemic (something about which Musk also has a concerning record). And on Tuesday, just minutes after Musk criticized one of Twitter’s top lawyers, a woman in charge of the safety team, she was swarmed with abusive tweets. This real-time demonstration of the problems Twitter faces when trying to maintain a reasonable environment for women to express themselves reveals Musk’s position and plan to be counterproductive to any real commitment to making Twitter a forum for anything other than fostering abuse that silences. There is hope for Twitter, but only if Musk loses interest in his new toy and spends his energy on any of his other three part-time jobs, running the Boring Company, SpaceX, or Tesla. If he lets the Twitter staff protect Twitter by protecting users from threats and abuse, the company has a chance.

4/28/2022,"The judge in the Johnny Depp v Amber Heard defamation trial was left temporarily lost for words on Wednesday after the court was shown the pre-recorded disposition of a doorman who was driving and vaping as he spoke. A visibly flummoxed Penney Azcarate described Alejandro Romero’s testimony as “a first” and ordered the court to break early for lunch after the video played. Laughter from the jury could also be heard throughout the recording, in which Romero, who worked at the Los Angeles apartment building where Depp and Heard had lived together, described the moment he investigated a possible intruder which he believed was just a dog. Romero described searching the property after Heard had reported a scratching on the door that she believed may have been an intruder. “They were talking about someone trying to get into their unit, and in my head I was saying ‘you really think someone is trying to get into your unit?’,” Romero said. “There’s scratches four inches above the floor on your door. That was a dog trying to get into your unit. “They were so afraid – I actually went. They asked me to go inside the unit just to check room by room to make sure that no one was actually there.” Romero added that he carried out the search because it was part of his job, but that he “didn’t understand why they wanted me to do that”. At one point he also expressed his frustration with the case, saying that he had been “so stressed out” and didn’t “want to deal with this any more”. When the video ended Azcarate told the court that it was a “good time to break for lunch”. She then took her glasses off, raised her eyebrows and shook her head from side to side. After a long pause, she added: “Alright … that was a first, I’m sorry.” Heard’s lawyer, Elaine Bredehoft, replied: “I will say your honour that was the most bizarre deposition …” Azcarate cut her off, raised her hands and said: “Yeah, OK, I just got to say I’ve never seen that before. I’ve seen a lot of things, but I’ve never seen that.”",Arts/Film,Doorman witness vapes and drives during testimony in Depp v Heard trial,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/28/doorman-witness-vapes-and-drives-during-testimony-in-depp-v-heard-trial
4/28/2022,"Klaus Schulze’s first appearance on vinyl was as a drummer in the nascent Tangerine Dream, a band that bore no resemblance whatsoever to the Tangerine Dream who were famed in the mid-70s for their beatless, beatific electronic epics. The frazzled, occasionally terrifying contents of their debut album Electronic Meditation sounded like early Pink Floyd with all the songs removed and the freeform experimentation cranked up to 11. The second track, Journey Through a Burning Brain, features atonal guitar soloing, vast swells of menacing organ, someone doing something supremely nerve-jangling with a flute and Schulze’s battering drums fading in and out of the mix. If this was psychedelia, it was psychedelia from long after the flower-power dream had curdled, reflecting the turbulent state of West Germany in the late 60s. After departing Tangerine Dream, Schulze formed Ash Ra Tempel with guitarist Manuel Göttsching and bassist Hartmut Enke. Krautrock authority Julian Cope described Amboss, the 19-minute track that takes up all of their debut album’s first side, as “the power-trio playing as meditational force … a methodical breaking-down of all your senses until you are crushed and insensible”, which perfectly sums up its relentless barrage of drums, feedback, hypnotically repetitious riffing and ferocious guitar solos that leap from speaker to speaker. Schulze’s drumming is astonishing: frantic but precise, driving but contained. Schulze’s debut solo album, Irrlicht, wasn’t electronic music as we now think of it: it didn’t even feature a synthesiser, consisting of sounds made using a broken electric organ and musique concrète techniques that involved him manipulating tape recordings of an orchestra. Weirdly, it might be even more prescient than the synthesiser-heavy music he went on to make; Satz: Ebene’s vast, swelling, ominous wave of sound feels remarkably close to latter-day drone music. The first side of Timewind was recorded in a studio, but effectively live – the whole thing was done in one take. Bayreuth Return is based around a shimmering sequencer passage that Schulze endlessly manipulates so that the track’s rhythm subtly shifts, overlaid with chilly electronic tones. The sound of Schulze reaching the pinnacle of his 70s style, it’s a mesmerising, transporting and mysterious piece of music. Schulze released so many albums that picking one as his best is a near-impossibility, but 1976’s Moondawn would definitely be in with a shout. The track that consumes its first side, Floating, is deep and exceptionally beautiful, but Mindphaser is something else: the shift, 11 minutes in, from beatless ambience to restless drumming that doesn’t so much power the music as dance around the synthesisers, is genuinely stunning. A masterpiece of what became known – thanks to the location of its main players – as the Berlin School of electronic music. You couldn’t wish for a greater contrast between the two “supergroups” with which Schulze was involved. The Cosmic Jokers were krautrock luminaries, reportedly paid in drugs for jamming at acid-fuelled parties, whose albums were released without their permission; despite such an unpromising origin story, their 1974 eponymous debut album is worth checking out. Go, however, featured Steve Winwood, jazz-fusion guitar maestro Al Di Meola, Stomu Yamash’ta – best known for his contributions to the soundtrack for The Man Who Fell to Earth – and various ex-members of Santana, Traffic and Bob Marley and the Wailers performing complex, proggy concept rock. Lost to history, Go sound absolutely nuts: on Time Is Here, soulful vocals battle for space with Meola’s dextrous fretwork, reggae-influenced drumming and layers of ambient synths. If nothing else, it’s a curio that demonstrates one deeply weird aspect of Schulze’s career, and the regard he was held in by his fellow musicians. Schulze billed his tenth album, X, as a series of “musical biographies” of various eminent figures, from Friedrich Nietzsche to Ludwig II von Bayern. It’s epic in scope, variously featuring drums, guitar and an orchestra alongside Schulze’s battalion of synths. But the track dedicated to expressionist Austrian poet Georg Trakl is effectively Schulze working in miniature, distilling his approach into just over five minutes that gradually build momentum thanks to some vaguely jazzy drumming. If you prefer your electronica in bite-size chunks, Schulze’s 70s ouevre is probably not for you, but he was – very occasionally – willing to oblige. As if his torrential solo output wasn’t enough, Schulze also recorded collaborative works under the pseudonym Richard Wahnfried. Tonwelle, from 1981, reunited him with Ash Ra Tempel guitarist Manuel Göttsching: rumours suggested the other guitarist, credited as Karl Wahnfried, was actually Carlos Santana. Whoever was involved, Druck is on a different planet to Schulze and Göttsching’s Ash Ra Tempel work. A gorgeous, sunlit drift of synth and guitar soloing, it’s as Balearic in its own way as Göttsching’s landmark 1984 album E2-E4 (the source, lest it be forgotten, of Sueño Latino’s eponymous dancefloor classic). “I did my music when electronics, synthesiser, computers, trance and techno were not around in music, not fashionable,” Schulze once remarked. “At last, my music is now accepted and fulfilled by a new generation who does not have the prejudice of their parents.” If you were looking for evidence of how Schulze was accepted by the post-acid house generation, then the series of collaborative albums he made with the late ambient artist and founder of FAX records, Pete Namlook – who claimed Schulze was his biggest influence – is one place to start. There are 11 volumes of the punningly titled Dark Side of the Moog series to work through, and the quality control isn’t always up to snuff – a perennial problem with the prolific Namlook – but the banging techno on display here shows how easily Schulze’s vision was adapted to a new era. Quite aside from the sheer quality of their music, you can understand why Schulze was a long-term fan of Dead Can Dance: the influence of his atmospheric electronics was clearly in the duo’s DNA. His collaboration with singer Lisa Gerrard must have sparked: the two and half hours of music that comprised their first album together, Farscape, was apparently recorded in two afternoons. Loreley, from the live album Rheingold, captures the duo on stage, Gerrard’s haunting vocals floating over a Schulze backdrop that moves from pacific to pulsing and back again. At nearly 40 minutes long, it’s music you immerse yourself in rather than listen to: then again, you could say that about almost all of Schulze’s greatest work.

4/28/2022,"Debut writer Evelyn Araluen has won the Stella prize, Australia’s literary award for women and non-binary writers, for her collection Dropbear – making her the first poet to win the $60,000 award in the first year poetry was allowed to enter. The biggest impact this will have on her life, she says, is that she can now drop one of the part-time jobs she works in order to support her writing – which means that she will only have two. She is only half-joking; the lockdowns, cutbacks and cancellations of the past two years have made the already-difficult task of making a living as a writer (of any kind, let alone a poet) even more challenging than usual. The desk where she edited Dropbear was the only piece of furniture in her entire flat, aside from her bed. She had just moved to Melbourne when the first lockdowns began in 2020, making it impossible for her and her partner to find work in their new city. Additional furniture would have to wait a few months, when they could afford it. “I was writing it while I was one paycheck away from complete poverty,” Araluen says. While she is both thrilled and grateful for the Stella prize, she is adamant that “this cannot be the way we sustain the arts”. Better funding, for more writers, is essential. Before this year, poetry was not eligible for the award, ruling out work from a whole community of accomplished and exciting women and non-binary writers, many of them people of colour. Araluen’s win is a big moment for poetry, and for the poet herself, who is greatly respected within the field and widely considered one of Australia’s most innovative emerging writers. She hopes that her win will encourage publishers to take a risk and publish more poetry, breaking down some of the barriers to publication that many poets face. It is unusual for a debut collection of poetry to be as hotly anticipated as Dropbear was, or for it to reach as many readers new to the form as it already has. But it is a remarkable book: wildly inventive and wickedly funny, as engaging as it is fiercely intelligent. Many of the poems are reimaginings of kitschy Australiana and children’s books (Snugglepot and Cuddlepie and Blinky Bill both feature prominently), as well as Australian literary traditions and accounts of history. Central to the poems’ subversive nature is the way they consciously situate themselves within tradition, while also addressing and imagining an Aboriginal reader. “A lot of contemporary settler writing has an anxiety about the Aboriginal writer speaking against it,” says Araluen, a descendant of the Bundjalung nation. “But even in that there isn’t a strong sense of thinking about an Aboriginal reader.” How many authors or publishers consider “what an Aboriginal reader might take from the book”, or how it might “be understood and interpreted by them”? This too is an erasure, and an important one. Dropbear is also deeply personal: there are poems about family and love, about the small and necessary measures for getting by. There’s an “Inevitable Pandemic Poem”, alongside poems about travel and home: Araluen is from Dharug country, in western Sydney, and her depictions of this landscape and what it holds for her are startling and sharp. These are poems, as Araluen writes, of “rage and dreaming”, always together; poems that are interested in our participation in the oppressive power structures of our politics, our literature, our world. Araluen is already working on her next project, which she describes as “a fictocritical novel” about sexism and racism in 20th-century Australian publishing, which seeks to explore how discrimination and bias impacts publishing today. It is a project that is very much in keeping with the aims of the Stella prize itself, so it seems fitting that its prize money will help Araluen conduct her research and write it. Writing fiction, she admits, “is terrifying”, but she intends to take her time – which winning makes possible. But what Araluen finds most “mind-blowing” about her win is that she is joining a list of Stella recipients that includes Waanyi author Alexis Wright and her form-breaking biography Tracker, a book that Araluen says brought so many people who had never read about Indigenous land rights into contact with new ideas. “I heard so many people, unexpected people, say that reading Tracker taught them so much, even that it changed their life,” she says. Now becoming part of that lineage herself “is just the craziest, craziest thing”.
