2/25/2022,"Donald Trump said the Ukraine crisis would not have happened if he were still president. Trump was impeached in 2019 after freezing nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. He also previously said Crimea is part of Russia and praised Putin's actions as ""genius"" and ""savvy."" Former US President Donald Trump, who was impeached for withholding nearly $400 million in military aid from Ukraine, said the country's current crisis ""would never have happened"" if he were still in office. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine early Thursday, with Russian troops swarming into the country from its northern, eastern, and southern borders. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Thursday evening address that 137 Ukrainians have died and 306 have been wounded as a result of the invasion. Trump released a statement amid the crisis, saying, ""If I were in Office, this deadly Ukraine situation would never have happened!"" The statement came after Trump earlier this week praised Putin's justification for invading Ukraine as ""genius"" and ""savvy."" ""I went in yesterday, and there was a television screen, and I said, 'This is genius.' Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine — of Ukraine — Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that's wonderful,"" Trump said when asked about the news. ""I said, 'How smart is that?' And he's going to go in and be a peacekeeper."" His comments stood in contrast to those of US officials, who warned that Putin's recognition of two Kremlin-backed separatist regions in Ukraine was part of an effort to create a false pretext and invade the country. Trump was impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The articles of impeachment were related, in part, to Trump's efforts to strongarm Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into launching politically motivated investigations against the Bidens ahead of the 2020 election, and withholding vital military aid while doing so. The hold on the security assistance was lifted after Politico reported on Trump's actions and House Democrats launched an investigation into the matter. In 2018, Trump again shocked American allies by eschewing years of US foreign policy and telling G7 leaders that the territory of Crimea is part of Russia. His remarks were especially jarring to the leaders of other member states given that it was Russia's decision to annex Crimea in 2014 that led to its expulsion from the G8. But Trump told reporters before that year's G7 summit that he believed Russia should be admitted back into the alliance, and he also reportedly wondered aloud at the summit why world leaders sided with Ukraine over Russia. Earlier this week, Trump blamed the crisis unfolding in Ukraine on the ""rigged"" 2020 election. ""Well, what went wrong was a rigged election and what went wrong is a candidate that shouldn't be there and a man that has no concept of what he's doing,"" Trump said, adding that the invasion ""never would have happened with us — had I been in office, not even thinkable. This would never have happened.""

2/25/2022,"Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday blamed Russia's invasion of Ukraine on his election loss. After he brought up false election claims, the Fox News host Laura Ingraham cut the interview short. Ingraham cut to a speech on the floor of the United Nations, which other networks also showed. Former President Donald Trump called into Fox News late Wednesday night only to be cut off once he brought up falsehoods about the 2020 US election. The prime-time opinion host Laura Ingraham was asking Trump about ""a lot of weakness in the United States"" and where NATO stood as Russia mounted an invasion of Ukraine, news of which broke shortly before the former president's interview. Trump quickly pivoted to reiterating his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election. ""I think you're exactly right — I think that's what happened,"" Trump said. ""He was going to be satisfied with a peace, and now he sees the weakness and the incompetence and the stupidity of this administration, and, as an American, I'm angry about it, and I'm saddened by it,"" he continued, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""And it all happened because of a rigged election. This would have never happened."" —Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) February 24, 2022 After Trump brought up his ""rigged election"" line, Ingraham ended the interview.

Representatives from Fox News pointed to the network's live coverage from Ukraine when asked for comment. The Fox News reporters Trey Yingst and Steve Harrigan were on the ground in Ukraine providing live coverage, and Ingraham returned to her previously scheduled interview with the journalist Glenn Greenwald after coming back from the floor of the United Nations.

2/25/2022,"The president of a major Russian business groups urged Putin to dodge economic fallout of the Ukraine invasion. Countries including the US and UK have levied new sanctions on Russia after it attacked Ukraine Thursday. Alexander Shokhin called on Putin to ""demonstrate as much as possible"" that Russia ""remains part of the global economy."" The head of one of Russia's biggest business groups urged President Vladimir Putin on Thursday to avoid severe economic pain and remain ""part of the global economy"" as NATO members ready a harsher salvo of sanctions. Putin held a televised meeting with the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs just hours after Russian forces began attacks in Ukraine. The invasion has quickly rippled throughout the global economy, with financial markets plummeting, commodity prices soaring, and experts warning of weaker economic growth. The attacks have also prompted the US, UK, and the European Union to discuss more painful economic retaliation. The threat of new sanctions was enough for Alexander Shokhin, the business group's president, to raise concerns with Putin about remaining a member of the world economy. The lobbyist urged the president to pad against major economic pain and to ensure conflict in Ukraine doesn't fuel widespread harm to the global financial system. ""Everything should be done to demonstrate as much as possible that Russia remains part of the global economy and will not provoke, including through some kind of response measures, global negative phenomena on world markets,"" Shokhin said. The New York Times reported Shokhin was ""very much visibly nervous"" during his appeal. Putin responded by defending the attack as a ""necessary measure,"" adding that countries imposing sanctions ""created such great risks"" that it was ""impossible to react with any other means."" Markets didn't seem to buy the defense. The MOEX Index — a popular benchmark for Russian stocks — cratered 33% in Thursday trading, marking the fifth-worst drop in stock-market history. The Russian ruble also sank to a record low against the US dollar as investors lost faith in the currency's value. The market moves reflect fears that retaliation will damage more than a few Russian businesses. Sanctions announced just ahead of the attacks targeted Russian financial institutions and elites, but new proposals are markedly more severe to the country's entire economy. President Joe Biden unveiled a second tranche of punitive measures Thursday afternoon, promising Russia would ""bear the consequences"" of its invasion. The latest sanctions target more Russian elites and freeze technology exports to the country. The US also expanded its sanctions against Russian banks to include more firms including Sberbank, Russia's largest financial institution and the holder of almost one-third of the banking sector's wealth. ""Full-blocking"" sanctions were also announced for four more Russian banks, essentially banning them from operating with US entities and freezing their US-based assets. The UK followed with its own updated sanctions. Prime Minister Boris Johnson rolled out new measures targeting Russian banks, businesses, and oligarchs on Thursday, effectively kicking them out of the UK's financial system. The British government also clamped down on exports of technology to Russia and banned the country's Aeroflot airline. The economic damage, then, is set to intensify. When Russia starts to feel the heat remains uncertain. It's ""going to take some time"" before the newest US sanctions start to strangle the Russian economy, Biden said Thursday. The president added that more damaging measures, such as blocking Russia from the Swift financial communications network, remain on the table.
