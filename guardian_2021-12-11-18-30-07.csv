12/11/2021,"Three generations of Arah Parker’s family have lived in her pleasant, yellow-hued home, where there used to be a clear view of the San Gabriel mountains from the kitchen window. There used to be – until the country’s hunger for online shopping swallowed the neighborhood.  Four massive Amazon warehouses – ranging from 500,000 to nearly 900,000 sq ft – now surround this historically Black community, as do distribution centers for Target, Under Armour, Monster Energy and Keeco textiles. Her home is now boxed in on three sides by concrete block buildings and the quiet road out front has been paved into a four-lane expressway rumbling with delivery trucks. The ancient mountains are obscured by a “big, block wall” and more often than not, they are further shrouded by a noxious layer of haze belched up by the trucks. “To watch the transformation, it really has been disheartening,” said Parker, 39. The Inland Empire region, where Parker lives, is now one of the biggest national hubs for the e-commerce industry. The changes it has undergone are being replicated in cities and towns across the country. To feed the one-click, one-day delivery demands of the nation, new warehouses are opening quickly, often in Black and brown neighborhoods. They sometimes chew up entire suburban blocks and communities in the process, crowding roadways with delivery trucks and vans and air space with cargo planes, clouding the air with more pollution. Located about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, the Inland Empire has the third-largest concentration of Amazon warehouses in the US, according to a database of Amazon facilities Consumer Reports (CR) purchased from MWPVL, a logistics consulting firm. The people living within a mile of most Amazon warehouses are more likely to be poor and people of color than those living in the typical neighborhood in the surrounding urban area, a new analysis by CR, published this week in collaboration with the Guardian, found. About 67% of residents in the Inland Empire people of color. Within a mile of the average Amazon warehouses in the area, 81% of residents are people of color, according to the CR analysis. Amazon, which is the largest private employer in the region, has continued to rapidly expand its facilities and warehouses here. The company opened eight new facilities in the Inland Empire in 2020 and at least five this year – altogether operating 34 facilities in the area. In an area that already faces some of the worst traffic and air pollution in the US, the explosive growth of the warehouse industry threatens to exacerbate already high rates of asthma and other respiratory issues. Placed close to the LA and Long Beach ports – the two busiest in the US – and encompassing four major freeway routes, the region is strategically situated, not just for Amazon, but about every major e-commerce and logistics company. Overall, there are hundreds of warehouses in the Inland Empire. “Our communities of color have become the sacrifice for one of the biggest, wealthiest companies in the world,” said Anthony Victoria, an environmental justice organizer based in the region. “This is the cost of online shopping.” Parker’s neighborhood in Rialto, where her grandfather and great uncle settled during the 1940s, is now reduced to just her family, and one other one down the street. All the other neighbors sold their plots to warehouse developers. “You should see how they try to race the semis down the street,” said Marcus Gutierrez, who lives near Parker with his sister Maria. “They’ve taken out our mailbox twice,” Maria chuckled. “We have to be careful when we go get the mail because the trucks will take the mail right out of your hands.”The trucks are everywhere – idling outside sports arenas and high schools. Six out of eight schools in the Inland town of Bloomington are located or will be located right next to a warehouse. Eighteen-wheelers are parked along small residential streets. Semis rattle through the streets, the vibrations over time causing cracks into the homes they drive by. At the mall in Moreno Valley, shoppers sometimes see a fleet of Amazon delivery vans parked in the lot by the JCPenny. “It’s everywhere – warehouses everywhere and pollution everywhere,” said Mitzi Archer, the board president of the non-profit Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice (CCAEJ). “You don’t see that in Beverly Hills. You don’t see that in the wealthy parts of Los Angeles. They’re coming into communities populated with Hispanic and Black people.” Archer and her family have been living in Moreno Valley, about 500 feet from the 60 highway and a continuous procession of semis, for nearly three decades. Her son Thomas Winbush Jr, 27, struggled with asthma growing up. And her late husband, Winbush’s namesake, died at age 57, of multiple myeloma – a blood cancer in the bone marrow. In Archer’s husband’s last days, the doctor told her something that still makes her angry. “She said the type of cancer could be caused by a lot of things, but based on where we lived, it was likely from the environment.” Her family had been exposed for decades, even before Amazon had arrived. CCAEJ, which Archer joined shortly after her husband’s death, was started in the 1970s to fight for those living near the Stringfellow Acid Pits, a notorious toxic waste site. Elsewhere in the Inland Empire, pollution from the BNSF rail yard in San Bernardino emits a stream of pollution linked with elevated cancer risk. Billionaires have long treated the region as a dumping ground, said Tom Dolan, the executive director of the faith-based advocacy organization, Inland Congregations United for Change. In fighting against rail yard pollution, local activists had to take on BNSF, a company owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. “Now it’s no longer just Warren Buffett, it’s Jeff Bezos and Amazon,” said Dolan. “And we’re paying their cost of doing business.” Dolan himself developed chronic bronchitis – a condition that is common among smokers – but in his case was likely triggered by pollution. When tailpipe emissions cook under the sunlight and heat to create a thick layer of smog over the region, Dolan has been in and out of the hospital. His wife Cecilia Miranda Dolan, who used to work as a physical education teacher at the Norton Science Academy, an elementary school located near the Amazon Air Regional Air Hub in San Bernardino, said a third of her students had some respiratory issue. “They could run for just 100 meters before it was too much.” A recent report from the local air quality monitoring management office found that people living within half a mile of warehouses have higher rates of asthma and heart attacks than residents in the area overall. Across Riverside and San Bernardino counties, which encompass the Inland Empire, 71% of children 10 and under have asthma, according to public health data compiled by the University of California, LA. “It feels like we’re disposable humans,” said Amparo Miramontes, who moved from LA to the Inland city of Fontana about a decade ago, in search of an affordable home to raise her family during the Great Recession. Around the same time, warehousing began to take hold in the region. And Miramontes and her whole family believe they have felt the effects. It started when she and her husband began getting frequent nosebleeds. Her then-infant daughter kept falling ill with respiratory infections. Soon, Miramontes developed asthma so severe that when she became pregnant with her son, she couldn’t breathe in enough oxygen for the both of them. “At one point, my oxygenation wouldn’t go over 60%, no matter how hard I tried,” she said. Her baby was born with respiratory issues. At four months, he needed a nebulizer four times a day. At 10 months, his lungs remained weak. “He had these big, huge black rings under his eyes all the time,” she said, a sign that his oxygenation levels were low and he was anemic. Her son, now eight, still uses a nebulizer often and an inhaler regularly – but he’s been doing much better since she invested in air purifiers at home and enrolled him in a magnet school about 15 miles away, where the air quality is better. She doesn’t let either of her kids play outdoor sports and constantly worries about the long-term effects on their health. With each new proposed warehouse development in her neighborhood, she grows angrier. Local leaders, she said, “have basically sold off people’s lungs”. She thinks often about whether she should move, but for now, she wants to stay and fight – in part because she feels it’s the right thing to do. She’s seen the warehousing industry spread, across southern California and the US. “It’s a hard decision,” she said. “Sometimes I’m like, ‘Damn, I’m a horrible mom. I need to leave.’” To track precisely how much the warehouse boom has impacted air pollution, non-profit organizations in the area as well as researchers from UC Riverside, have been fitting residents with wearable air quality trackers. Facing pressure from local activists, Riverside, Colton and Jurupa Valley have issued moratoriums on opening new warehouses, while officials assess their environmental impact. In May this year, the local air quality regulator adopted a rule that will require operators of warehouses 100,000 sq ft or larger to cut or offset emissions or pay a mitigation fee to fund air quality improvements nearby. Over the next few years, to avoid paying fees, warehouse operators will have to show that they have taken steps such as transitioning to electric or natural gas-fueled trucks, installing rooftop solar panels or providing air filters to neighboring schools and child-care centers – changes that regulators say could result in up to 300 fewer deaths and 5,800 fewer asthma attacks from 2022 through 2031. Amid mounting criticisms over pollution, Amazon has said it is planning to transition to electric transport and delivery vehicles. “We’re deploying 100,000 electric delivery vehicles by 2030 that will save millions of metric tons of carbon and reduce local air pollution, installing solar rooftops at our facilities, including 11 solar rooftop systems in the Inland Empire,” said Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti, in an emailed statement. However, Ivette Torres, a researcher with the local non-profit environmental justice group People’s Collective for Environmental Justice (PC4EJ), said even if Amazon transitions to electric vehicles, they worry that the onus of acquiring new, electric trucks will likely still fall on local drivers and fleets, they said. And even if environmental protections are put in place, Amazon and other e-commerce companies have created a community that has become so deeply dependent on the industry, that extricating the Inland Empire from its grasp will be complicated, Torres noted. At San Bernardino’s Cajon High School, the company has funded an Amazon Logistics & Business Management Pathway Program of Study, which helps to train students to work in the logistics industry. Another high school in town, Pacific High, prepares students to work on commercial diesel trucks. Young people are receiving the message “that if they want to work another type of job, they have to leave the area”, Torres said. The promise of jobs and tax revenue is what local leaders and elected officials have used to justify the approval of more warehouse constructions. The region had been hit hard by the Great Recession and in 2012, when Amazon opened its first warehouse in the region, the unemployment rate for the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario area was 11.7%, the highest among US metro areas with populations greater than 1m. In July, the California attorney general filed a lawsuit against Fontana, challenging its approval of a 205,000 sq ft project that would border a public high school. But Acquanetta Warren, the Fontana mayor who has helped usher in about 60 warehouses and logistics facilities over the past five years – and who critics have dubbed “Warehouse Warren” – has remained steadfast. ​​“We have the cheaper land,” Warren said, and the region is surrounded by freeways – the 10, the 15, the 210, 215 and 60. The warehouses’ presence in Fontana and surrounding towns made strategic sense. And “they’re the key to our economic vitality”, she said. Warehouse workers told the Guardian that jobs can be grueling. “It’s a lot of wear and tear on the body,” said one former Amazon worker, who badly injured her arm during a shift at a fulfillment facility, quitting shortly afterward. But she returned to Amazon, because it was the only place she knew she could quickly and easily find work during the Covid-19 lockdowns. “It pretty much was the only option,” she said. Other current and former Amazon workers said they had been discouraged from taking restroom breaks and were pushed by management to lift and load heavy boxes at near-impossible speeds. Some current and former employees surveyed by researchers at UC Riverside said they permanently lost hearing because they weren’t offered proper ear protection while working in loud sorting and loading centers. “This is the slow violence of the supply chain,” said Victoria, the environmental activist. “You get worn down by the hard labor. Or you get torn down by the pollution.” Local residents said they are often left feeling like they are no match against the powerful e-commerce industry and local governments eager to build more warehouses. In a region where Latino residents make up the majority and where many residents are monolingual Spanish speakers, council meetings to discuss new warehouse constructions often lacked Spanish translation. Ma Carmen González, a community organizer with PC4EJ, said city officials have repeatedly told her she needs to bring her own translators. Earlier this year, even after local activists pushed the San Bernardino city council to assess the costs of providing Spanish-language interpretation at meetings, one local councilman, Fred Shorett, scoffed, “this is an English-speaking country”. González said she’s grown increasingly angry and disheartened with each new warehouse that’s constructed in San Bernardino. As the industry takes over, “we are the forgotten ones”, she said.

12/11/2021,"When The Matrix asks us all to take the red pill again on 22 December, Carrie-Anne Moss, 54, will return to the role that made her famous. Moss first played Trinity, a motorbike-riding, badass, PVC-clad hacker, in 1999, and despite the character not surviving the original trilogy, she is back, along with her co-star Keanu Reeves, for the fourth instalment, The Matrix Resurrections, directed by Lana Wachowski, this time without her sister Lilly. Moss, who was born in Canada, started her career as a model and had several small parts on television and in films before The Matrix struck gold. She played Marvel’s first on-screen lesbian character, Jeri Hogarth, in the Netflix series Jessica Jones, and away from the acting world, she runs a “labour of love” lifestyle site called Annapurna Living. She lives with her husband and three children in the countryside in California, which means she does not see the current trend for Matrix-inspired fashion such as big stompy boots and tiny sunglasses out on the streets.  Was returning to the world of The Matrix a tough decision?Oh, no. I was absolutely over-the-moon excited about the prospect. It was something that I never imagined happening. People had mentioned it to me in passing, and I was always thinking: ‘No way. Never gonna happen.’ There are obvious reasons for that, the main one being that Trinity dies in the third film.When myself, Lana, Keanu and a few others sat together to read it for the first time, I was thinking: ‘What is this going to be like? How is she going to do this?’ It’s something that I never imagined, and I was really blown away. The Matrix came out in 1999, but it has been a near-constant part of the cultural conversation ever since. How does it feel to have been such a big part of that?It’s interesting. I’m definitely honoured to be in a film that made such an impact, and I’m deeply respectful of the part that I play in that story. I also have my own personal life that doesn’t include any of that, and so I don’t really feel the cultural impact. At the same time, when I do feel the weight of it, I’m moved that I got chosen to be that part of this film, and what it means to people, and I don’t take that lightly. It’s not just some job I did. When I did the first Matrix, it seemed to really impact women a lot. Women would come up to me, women directors, and stuntwomen, and they would thank me for opening this door or that. So I hold it with a lot of reverence, and a lot of deep respect. I respect this character more than any character that I’ve ever played. I chose not to play similar characters. I didn’t want to give Lana and Lilly’s hard work and beautiful artistry to any other film-maker. Were you offered roles like Trinity a lot?It did happen, and then it was just really clear. I think it didn’t even get past anybody to get to me because I was just like: I’m not going to do that. I think a lot of people interpreted it as that I didn’t want to stereotype myself, and it had nothing to do with stereotypes. It only had to do with my respect for the film-makers, and the film, and I didn’t want to sell that out. It was a no-brainer. I’m grateful now, coming around full circle to it, and getting to be in it again. There’s a real purity about it for me. What do you think those women were thanking you for?I don’t know. When I did the first film, I was super-young; I didn’t really understand all the different things that were happening, it was just such a whirlwind. When I saw the movie I was overwhelmed by it. I’d never seen myself in that way on a big screen. One of the things that I love about Trinity has to do with the gaze of thefilm-makers. It’s Lana, and how she shoots. She loves Trinity so much. I can really appreciate it, in hindsight. I didn’t feel that she was overly sexualised, and I don’t think they would have picked me anyway if they were looking for that. I am grateful, in Hollywood terms, that it wasn’t taken in that direction. I watched an interview you did around the release of the first Matrix, and you talked about trying to shoot a scene in heels, which was a problem for you. I checked the trailer for Resurrections, and Trinity appears to be wearing flat-soled boots. Is that progress?In the first one, there was one scene where they had me in a kind of a stiletto, and I couldn’t do the scene. I had auditioned with that scene, and then suddenly there we are on the day shooting it, and I was unsteady. It was the whole thing in the nightclub, where I’m whispering in the guy’s ear, and I’m supposed to be really grounded and strong, and yet I could barely stand straight. And so they took those off and gave me a boot with a nice solid heel. Well, footwear matters.Yeah. I’m a clog girl, personally. What did you have to do to get back into Trinity mode?A lot of the preparation was physical training. I had weight to lose, I had strength to gain, I had fights to learn, I had big scenes to mentally prepare for. For months leading up to it, it was a lot of physical work, to get into Trinity in a way that wasn’t me trying to be someone I used to be, and not trying to be 30, or trying to have the body I had when I was 30, and at the same time, being gentle with myself about that, too. When I had babies, I gained weight, and it took me years to come back into my body that I felt strong and comfortable in. I wonder if it’s less of a big deal than it was to have female action heroes in their 40s, 50s and 60s? It’s been normal for male actors for a long time, but I think fewer people would bat an eyelid about women doing those sorts of parts now.I haven’t really thought too deeply about it. Except that for my own personal journey, I didn’t want to add any desperation on to myself, because in a way, I would feel like I was doing all the women my age, who were 30 [once], a disservice. This feeling that I have about Trinity is that it’s not just about me, and I take that to heart. If suddenly I show up and I’m like … I don’t even know what that would look like, but let’s be real, seeing yourself on screen is not easy. It wasn’t easy when I was 30, either. But what I do feel happy about in seeing the movie is that I didn’t really even think about it. How much truth is there to the rumour that Keanu Reeves is the nicest man in the movie business?Ha ha! He’s a very kind person, and he’s so good at what he does. He is very committed and disciplined. And he works harder than anyone I’ve ever met. It was a pure pleasure to get to partner with him again, in this way. It was as if no time had passed. We all have those friends where you can just pick up right where you left off. He’s a great listener. It’s really lovely to be around a man who listens in the way that he does. He’s very thoughtful in his listening. He deserves all of that good press about his compassion and kindness. You said you made a decision not to play characters like Trinity, but there has been a thread of authority running through your characters recently. You were a doctor in Humans, a lawyer in Jessica Jones …Well, I think the common denominator is who’s playing them. They do all look like you.It was interesting to me that [Jeri Hogarth in Jessica Jones] was originally a guy. The character was written as a man, and when I talked to them about it, I didn’t want them to change it too much. I liked this idea that she had this stereotypical male kind of energy. That was quite fun to play. Actually, I really enjoyed doing that. It was my first [big] job after I had children. When I got that job, and I went to New York, it was as if I had walked into an entirely new world, with technology, and all of this stuff. I couldn’t even order a coffee! It was really a culture shock. Krysten Ritter, my co-star, I was always asking her things, she was helping me put Uber on my phone, little things, but New York was a real learning curve for me. It was quite jarring. I was quite comfortable at home, so I was stepping out of my comfort zone. You don’t seem like a very Hollywood person to me.I’ve never really been interested in any of that. I never went to any Hollywood stuff, premieres or events or whatever, unless it was something that I was part of, or I was supporting a friend. Sometimes in the beginning, my team would say: ‘Maybe she’d go to that thing.’ And I’d be like: ‘I don’t want to have to get dressed and figure out what to wear, and I don’t know how to do my makeup, and I don’t know how to do my hair.’ And I’m OK that I don’t know how to do that stuff. I would rather be at home with my family any day. I’ve worked really hard to have this connected family life, and that means a lot to me. It’s not because it’s perfect or easy, but it’s where I belong, in my heart. When I leave to go to work, I ultimately always love it, because you’re forced to get out of your comfort zone. It’s so healthy. But when I come home, I love my simple life.

12/11/2021,"Back in spring 2020, when it became clear that coronavirus wasn’t going away, book lovers spied an opportunity for a rare, government-mandated reading holiday. Here, at last, was a chance to have a go at Tolstoy’s War and Peace and Proust’s In Search of Lost Time. Robert Macfarlane reported that he was working his way through the great Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh. Ali Smith urged readers towards Boccaccio’s Decameron. Diana Evans’s thoughts turned “heavenwards” by way of Homer’s Odyssey. I downloaded 27 hours of The Brothers Karamazov audiobook in anticipation. All lovely ideas. With 20 months of hindsight, however, which books did we actually end up turning to? The bestseller lists from the three different lockdowns may not tell you the contents of Britain’s soul, but then again, the numbers do not lie. We read: The Thursday Murder Club by Richard Osman. Sophie Hinchliffe’s Mrs Hinch: The Little Book of Lists. Lots of David Walliams, who topped the Lockdown 1 and Lockdown 2 charts with Slime and Code Name Bananas respectively. JK Rowling: the first three Harry Potter books steadily rose up the charts through the pandemic. Joe Wicks. The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse. A Pinch of Nom, plus spin-offs. Sally Rooney’s Normal People. Reni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race.  So: cosy crime, uncosy crime, tidying up books, weight loss books, self-improvement books, children’s books, books offering cutesy wisdom, romance and escapism all did well during the pandemic. But then again, so did the books industry as a whole. Despite the chaos of lockdown – bookshop closures, supply chain issues, disruption to release schedules, cancelled literary festivals, live talks and book clubs – by the end of 2020, overall sales of print books were up 5% year-on-year, according to industry watchers Nielsen BookScan, with the upwards trend continuing this year. Fiction did particularly well – adult fiction increased 8% in volume terms, with 147m books sold. So too did children’s books, up 7%, to 109m books. Overall, the British public spent £1.8 bn on 202m print books. Digital sales soared, ebooks growing 16% and audiobook sales 21% year on year. “Books had a real moment,” says Hannah Bourton, publishing director at Viking, which scored the big hit of the pandemic with Osman’s The Thursday Murder Club. “They were immediate, they were accessible. We all wanted to escape into different stories.” “It sounds bad, but the pandemic has been quite good for us,” agrees Phoebe Morgan, editorial director of HarperCollins. “Particularly in the commercial area of the market. Obviously there have been times where things have been difficult – and especially for the authors. But it has also shown that there’s a bigger appetite for reading than ever.” Even so, many people – myself included – found that they couldn’t necessarily follow through on their grand ambitions. “I heard a lot of people say that now was the time to read all of the books that they’d always meant to read, or finally sit down and write their novel,” says Damian Barr, the author of Maggie and Me and presenter of the Big Scottish Book Club. “But what I found was that the constant state of emergency really fractured my ability to concentrate.” He turned to poetry instead: Mary Oliver, Mark Doty, Richard Scott. “I found poetry meaningful and sustaining but short enough that I could manage it.” Personally, I abandoned Dostoevsky pretty swiftly, and soon found my level was the odd audiobook and as many Inspector Maigret mysteries as I could lay my hands on. Still, the uptick in book sales shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. When museums, galleries, theatres, cinemas and concert venues closed in March 2020, books (along with TV) were an obvious source of refuge: cheap, immersive, low-tech and solitary. A survey by Nielsen in May 2020 found that 41% of British people were reading more; the UK as a whole doubled the amount of time it spent reading books, from 3.5 hours to six hours per week. Philip Stone of Nielsen even noticed a “brief spike” in physical book sales just prior to the first lockdown, which he puts down to panic buying. “People really did rush out to buy books to keep them company as they bedded in.” Once the shops were closed, publishing was unusually well positioned to capitalise, argues Stone. “Even before the pandemic, online retail accounted for about 50% of the books market, so book consumers were pretty used to buying online.” So which books did we turn to in that first lockdown, when the world around us seemed so uncertain and alarming? Alongside pre-pandemic bestsellers by Lee Child and Hilary Mantel were school textbooks by homeschooling parents and the aptly timed thriller Lockdown by Peter May. Baking books did well, says Stone, adult colouring books had a second wave, and anything on personal development and mindfulness also sold strongly. Meanwhile, the Black Lives Matter protests helped to focus attention on writers of colour through the summer: Bernardine Evaristo and Reni Eddo-Lodge both sold well. But overall it’s what’s not on the charts that tells the bigger story. With the usual channels of recommendation disrupted, Amazon’s sales algorithms and supermarket buyers played an outsized role in shaping taste. “Tesco really stole a lot of market share and that had a huge influence on what people were reading,” says Bourton. “A book like Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens, which was already selling well in spring, became a big ongoing phenomenon. The high street plays a huge role in breaking new authors, whereas what the supermarkets excel at is the familiar. Sainsbury’s didn’t actually take any new titles last April – they just sold more of what they already had.” Morgan says that the closure of bookshops actually helped sales for the commercial thrillers and crime fiction in which she specialises. “A lot of the stuff I was publishing was really overperforming in the supermarkets.” She noticed that “locked-room” mysteries performed particularly well: “An ensemble cast, assembled in a remote location, perhaps somewhere exotic.” Among big sellers were The Guest List by Lucy Foley, which is about a murder at a wedding on a remote Irish island, and The Chalet by Catherine Cooper, set in a snowed-in ski resort. “There’s an obvious reason for that when everyone is locked in their house and can’t actually travel anywhere,” she says. However, the runaway hit was The Thursday Murder Club, an Agatha Christie-esque murder mystery set in a retirement complex, published in September 2020. It has now sold well over 1 million copies, spawned a sequel (The Man Who Died Twice), and had its movie rights snapped up by Steven Spielberg. Osman is a well-known TV personality and Viking won the rights to the novel after a 14-way auction in 2019, so its success wasn’t totally out of the blue. Still, Bourton feels in retrospect it was perfectly placed to capitalise on the pandemic. “It is a comforting story about a small community – and it also has such respect and reverence for characters who are older,” she says. “The main characters are all 70-plus and experiencing end-of-life care. That was reflecting something we were going through as a society with a sudden extreme loss of elderly people due to Covid.” We can expect more “cosy crime” in the future: the Reverend Richard Coles’s crime debut, Murder Before Evensong, is due in June next year. However, as Bea Carvalho, head fiction buyer at Waterstones, notes, all kinds of crime fiction did well. “There’s something comforting about the structure of crime novels, a puzzle that needs to fit together,” she says. “When the world is so uncertain and hard to understand, those traditional narratives, where by the end the author will have done the work for you – that’s pretty appealing.” The fact that Osman and Coles are celebrities tells its own story about the winners and losers in this period. The Bookseller found that, notwithstanding the industry’s success, 63% of authors had lost income in 2020 – with debut authors bearing the brunt. For those without name recognition or a pre-existing platform, the pandemic took its toll. “There were lots of authors who were published for the first time in lockdown who really missed out,” says Barr, who was forced to cancel all the events surrounding the paperback release of his own debut novel, You Will Be Safe Here. “We’re in danger of losing two or three years of amazing writers who just haven’t had the attention they deserve.” For all the challenges of lockdown, there were stirring successes when stores finally reopened. “We’ve really felt the power of recommendation since we’ve welcomed customers back in again,” says Carvalho. “You can’t really get that from algorithms.” One of her most successful books has been The Appeal, by former screenwriter Janice Hallett, which tells the story of a murder at an amateur dramatic society via a series of letters and emails, but asks the reader to solve the mystery. Bookshops were closed when it was released in hardback in early 2021, and, as a debut author, Hallett was not afforded any supermarket listings and had little publicity. Waterstones sold only a thousand copies online in its first month. However, those who did read it urged their friends to buy it and when shops opened again, it began to sell in ever-larger numbers, becoming their bestselling book in July. Another hit was Exciting Times, a love triangle set among bratty young expats in Hong Kong by the young Irish writer Naoise Dolan. Released during the first lockdown, the combination of exotic locale, escapist love story and Rooney comparisons (just as the Normal People adaptation was on TV screens) hit a sweet spot. There were also mini-trends. One was mythology. From children’s books about myths to contemporary retellings such as The Women of Troy by Pat Barker, Circe by Madeline Miller, or Ariadne by debut author Jennifer Saint, it seems we couldn’t get enough of those archetypes. Another was “armchair travel”. Actual travel books suffered badly – travel guides lost around 90% of sales in the first lockdown (though have mostly recovered) – but books that conjured specific locales fared well. And Carvalho has noted a huge increase in teenagers buying Japanese manga and graphic novels – often filming themselves doing so. This is a TikTok trend that has migrated over into real sales; she is now increasing the space devoted to manga across the chain. Tom Robinson actually managed to open a new independent bookshop mid-lockdown: Gloucester Road Books in Bristol. He has been pleasantly surprised by how ambitious his new customers have been, reporting a roaring trade in Ann Quin’s highly experimental novel Berg, sold simply by recommending it to customers. Another success has been The Weak Spot by Lucy Elven, published by the tiny Prototype press. “Bookshops develop and sustain relationships with their customers and their communities,” he says. “There was a growing consciousness about what Amazon and other low-cost retailers had done to books. I’m finding that people will take the hit of a couple of quid to order it from me instead. And there are lots of people who come in soliciting opinions, bringing in their recommendations, and telling me how they got on with them, too. I’ve realised this is such a significant part of what bookshops do.” So did any of us fulfil those ambitions we set out with at the beginning of the pandemic? Old favourites have sold well over the last 18 months, says Jessica Harrison at Penguin Classics. “We noticed that people really were turning to those great doorstopper novels: Middlemarch, Anna Karenina, Don Quixote, David Copperfield,” she says. “All of their sales increased by significant amounts in 2020, and sales are usually steady so it has been quite noticeable.” Nor has the trend stalled in 2021, she says, suggesting that these books are classics for a reason. The big mover has been The Plague by Albert Camus, which increased by more than 1,000% and is still selling strongly, as is Journal of a Plague Year by Daniel Defoe. She also sold lots of books by writers of colour: Women, Race and Class by Angela Davis, The Autobiography of Malcolm X and James Baldwin’s oeuvre all had an uplift. The major trend, however, was the Stoics. “Meditations by Marcus Aurelius was huge for us,” she says. “As was Letters from a Stoic by Seneca – that sold absolutely loads in lockdown – and so did Epictetus.” Seneca and Marcus Aurelius were also the two biggest classics audiobooks during lockdown. “I guess lots of people were looking for ancient wisdom during lockdown.” Coming soon to a supermarket near you, hopefully.

12/11/2021,"Yewande Omotoso is known for her second novel, The Woman Next Door, longlisted for the Women’s prize in 2017. As a reading experience, the follow-up An Unusual Grief is like a river. The story gathers turbulence and pace as it passes through its reader, twisting and turning back on itself until at last its emotional torsion seems to open out, as the grief fuelling this narrative achieves acceptance, or perhaps surrender, and the novel subsides into contemplative emotion. As a mapping of the progress of grief it skirts cliche, but only because grief does follow certain patterns. As the shape to a story it’s deeply satisfying.  Mojisola’s daughter Yinka has taken her own life, and in a traumatised fugue state, Mojisola travels to Yinka’s flat in Johannesburg from her home in Cape Town, leaving her serially unfaithful husband, Titus, behind her. She moves into the ruins of her daughter’s life, befriending her daughter’s former landlord and occasional drug dealer Zelda as she rents the flat for herself, and seeks to excavate who Yinka was and what happened to her. This search takes her deep into a life that is entirely unlike the one she herself has lived. Of course, it doesn’t work: the threads left behind do not amount to the person, as Mojisola eventually accepts. In the end, the closest thing to an insight into the day her daughter died turns out to be something Mojisola left behind in Cape Town. What she finds in Johannesburg is the unknowability of any other life – even her own child’s. Omotoso is good on grief, trauma, families, loss – but when it comes to the way people in extremes of emotion still have to do the washing up, or the way people go back to difficult marriages, and lives take on patterns that become their defining themes, she’s outstanding. The only real false note is the decision to place the point of catharsis at the moment where Mojisola cries for her daughter for the first time; the novel is more than good enough not to have needed that Hollywood moment. This caveat aside, An Unusual Grief reveals itself as a beautiful book that offers emotional truth to its readers, and a feeling of consolation for the imperfections we are all making our peace with, all the time.

12/11/2021,"BT’s status as a potential takeover target is back in focus after UK rules preventing its new largest shareholder from making its next move expired on Saturday. Here we look at the key points.  Altice, the telecoms group controlled by the billionaire Patrick Drahi, made an unexpected £2.2bn share swoop in June to take a 12.1% stake in BT. After the move Drahi, who has said he is supportive of management and their strategy and is not seeking to take control of BT, has been subject to a six-month no-bid clause. However, all bets are off from 11 December. Patrick Drahi The 58-year-old French-Israeli telecoms billionaire has amassed a $12bn (£9bn) fortune making shrewd bets, often involving aggressive cost-cutting programmes at businesses he controls. Drahi has made his money in the telecoms market, but he is best known in the wider media for his $3.7bn swoop on struggling auction house Sotheby’s in 2019. Philip Jansen The 54-year-old chief executive of BT, who has made an estimated $100m fortune from the flotation and subsequent buyout of his former employer WorldPay, has led the telecoms company for the past three years. Adam Crozier Drafted in as chairman designate on 1 March after a boardroom bust up between Jansen and chairman Jan du Plessis, the 57-year-old Scot officially took the helm on 1 December – just in time to join the frontline resistance to Drahi. Crozier’s CV spans chief executive stints at ITV, Royal Mail, the Football Association and the advertising group Saatchi & Saatchi, as well as chairman at online retailer Asos and the Premier Inn owner Whitbread. Tim Höttges The chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, BT’s second-largest shareholder with a 12.06% stake, has held its shareholding in a passive capacity as a legacy of the telecom’s company’s takeover of EE in 2015. KKR The US private equity firm has proposed a “friendly” buyout of Telecom Italia which, like BT, is a former state monopoly of significant strategic importance. A sign of private equity interest in European telecom stocks, and something of a template for how any deal for BT would need to be approached. The timing of Drahi’s stake-building was no accident. It followed BT’s £15bn commitment to roll out full-fibre broadband to 25m homes by 2026, having gained valuable regulatory and financial incentives guaranteeing a return on the huge investment over the long term. Telecoms have long argued that they are undervalued by the market; BT’s share price remains stubbornly about 65% down on 2015 levels, while the pandemic has shown the essential role internet and mobile companies play in society and strategic importance to the nation. Drahi could look to increase his stake in BT by snapping up more shares with one option to quickly double his holding by buying out Deutsche Telekom. Höttges said recently the company is “entertaining all options” regarding BT. Drahi could also demand a seat on the board, as Deutsche Telekom has, to increase his direct influence over future strategy. A full-blown takeover could also be on the cards, although it would come with significant ramifications, both in terms of competition and politics. Britain has become more wary of threats to the economy and national security posed by the sale of certain UK companies to foreign rivals and private equity firms. From January, the government will gain tougher powers to block the takeover of key national assets, which BT would certainly be designated, under the National Security and Investment Act 2021.",News/Business,Is BT the next British company in line for a takeover?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/11/is-bt-the-next-british-company-in-line-for-a-takeover
12/11/2021,"Astorm was raging when South Western Railway ordered all passengers to alight. The delayed 18.27 London to Exeter service was an hour from its destination, and torrential rain had prompted the company to abandon the journey. An announcement promised that coaches would relay travellers onwards but, when the train terminated at Yeovil Junction, no coaches could be found. Travellers would need to find taxis but none were available either.  The conductor reboarded the train and it drove off into the night leaving a couple of dozen people, including an unaccompanied minor, stranded on the platform of a locked, unstaffed station in the middle of the countryside. South Western’s treatment of its customers exposes discrepancies in consumer protections when it comes to air and rail travel. If a flight is cancelled, or delayed, airlines are obliged to reroute passengers as swiftly as possible, and to feed and accommodate them until this can be done. Passengers are entitled to two free phone calls and emails while they are stranded, and to compensation of up to £520 a head unless the delay was down to an extraordinary circumstance. Statutory protection for rail passengers was only applied to domestic journeys in the UK in 2019. Article 18 of the Passengers’ Rights and Obligations Regulations EC 1371/2007 obliges train operators to offer meals and accommodation “where physically possible”. There is no requirement for them to try to ensure that this is the case when deciding where to terminate a train. Compensation is limited to a proportion of the fare for the affected part of the journey, and there are no free phone calls. They may, ultimately, have to cover any costs that passengers incur as a result of the delay or cancellation but in the short term, travellers will need to fend for themselves. Among the passengers stranded that night was my 16-year-old son, Greg, who was on his way to visit his sister in Exeter. His mobile phone was low on charge after fruitless calls to taxi firms, the electronic help point at the station was not functioning, and South Western’s customer care line had shut at 10pm. From 180 miles away, I rang every local taxi company listed on Google. Only one had a cab available and quoted £250 for the 50-mile-trip because of the dangerous driving conditions. A hotel room was the only safe option but most do not accept unaccompanied minors. By 11pm, Greg was facing a night on the station platform in lashing rain. Eventually, a receptionist at a Premier Inn two miles away took pity – as a rule, it does not allow unaccompanied guests aged under 18 – and in a rare example of a big chain putting humanity ahead of terms and conditions, it agreed to check him in. The manager of a fully booked taxi firm, on hearing his age, diverted a taxi to get him there. Four other stranded passengers crowded in with him as it was the only cab that had made it to the station. They reached the hotel shortly before midnight. South Western’s staff did not check whether any passengers were vulnerable before abandoning them. Getting to the station exit involved negotiating steep steps on a footbridge over the line, making it inaccessible for those with reduced mobility. Those without smartphones had to rely on strangers to find accommodation or transport. The response from South Western’s customer service should give any parent or traveller with additional needs pause for thought. “The decision should be made before a journey, by considering whether your child could cope alone, bearing in mind the possibility there may be delays during times of disruption,” wrote a customer service agent. “We don’t offer specific assistance to children travelling alone, although our staff will always help if approached.” Customer services has since told affected passengers that their hotel and taxi expenses will be reimbursed, and they can apply for a refund of their fare via Delay Repay. South Western eventually refunded the £200 cost of the hotel and taxi, and I received £10.98 via Delay Repay for the affected leg of the journey. South Western admits it fell short. “This was a difficult night for staff working on our railway but it is clear that we should have communicated more effectively and made sure that alternative transport and accommodation was made available,” it says. “We are sorry that we fell short on this occasion. We are investigating this incident to learn lessons from what went wrong and improve our processes.” According to the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, passengers should be assisted if a service has to be abandoned. It adds: “The Consumer Rights Act gives rail passengers the ability to seek statutory redress if a train operator fails to provide a passenger service with reasonable care and skill.” Passengers with an unresolved complaint can appeal to the Rail Ombudsman, whose decision is binding on participating companies. The service will shortly be announcing details of a campaign aimed at making rail travel safer for young people. A spokesperson for the Rail Ombudsman said it expected train companies “to assist wherever possible to ensure that no passengers are ever stranded without reasonable options”. The spokesperson added: “The ombudsman is striving to empower young people when it comes to remaining safe on the rail network and will be launching the Young Person’s Train Guide, a campaign which will engage with rail operators and other stakeholders in the industry around the laws and bylaws that govern it.”",Lifestyle/Money,"South Western left my 16-year-old son stranded at a locked, unstaffed station",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/11/south-western-left-my-16-year-old-son-stranded-at-a-locked-unstaffed-station
12/11/2021,"Ayear ago humanity embarked on a project to vaccinate every person against Covid-19. But in recent months a shadow vaccination campaign has also been taking place. From giraffes to snow leopards, gorillas to sea lions, zoos around the world have been inoculating their animals with an experimental Covid vaccine as an insurance policy against what they fear could be a similarly fatal illness for certain mammals. Meanwhile, veterinary scientists have been scrambling to understand the scale of Covid-19 infection in our furry household companions, and what the consequences could be for their health – and our own.  Last week two hippos at Antwerp zoo in Belgium became the latest in a coterie of creatures to contract Covid from humans. Fortunately, Imani and Hermien had no symptoms apart from runny noses, but other animals haven’t been so fortunate. In November three snow leopards died from Covid-related complications at a children’s zoo in Nebraska. Other zoos have reported infections in gorillas, lions, tigers and cougars. Although Sars-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in an animal, most likely a bat, until recently most of the scientific focus has, understandably, been on human cases of disease. Yet ever since the early days of the pandemic, scientists have worried about the possibility of other animal infections. “We’ve always recognised that coronaviruses have this tremendous capacity to jump species. So it was always predicted that there would be a variety of domestic animals, livestock and potentially wildlife that could be infected,” said Margaret Hosie, a professor of comparative virology at the University of Glasgow’s Centre for Virus Research. If other animals can become infected and transmit the virus, this could put pressure on it to adapt and acquire new mutations, raising the prospect of new variants that could be transmitted back to people. “You could be concentrating on eradicating the virus in humans, but meanwhile the virus could be mutating away quietly in an animal species, and getting hotter and hotter,” Hosie said. The first report of an animal infection came in February 2020 when a dog in Hong Kong tested positive, probably having contracted it from its infected owner. Since then there have been numerous reports of dogs and cats with Covid. Other pets generally appear less susceptible – no one has yet identified a Covid-positive goldfish – although ferrets and golden hamsters can catch Covid-19, and dwarf Roborovski hamsters can die from it. Further research has suggested that cat and dog infections are relatively common. Scientists in the Netherlands found that in 20% of households they visited where pet owners had tested positive for Covid, the cats and dogs had antibodies for the virus. Some infected animals develop symptoms – generally a runny nose, coughing, sneezing or conjunctivitis – and most make uneventful recoveries. However, some may experience more severe illness. “The first cat that we identified as being infected from its owner was a young kitten that died of pneumonia,” said Hosie. “We didn’t test exhaustedly for other potential pathogens, so we couldn’t say for sure, but the pathology was very similar to the viral pneumonia seen in Covid-19 patients.” But are these infected pets contagious? Evidence from dogs suggests the risk of onward transmission is low because it is difficult to isolate replicating virus from them. On cats, the jury is still out. Experimental studies have suggested they can infect other cats, but the degree to which this happens in the real world is uncertain. Cats are relatively solitary creatures – they don’t spend much time in close contact with other cats or humans (besides their owners). So if they catch Covid-19, their owner is probably the source, and any onward transmission is likely to be extremely limited. Farmed mink, on the other hand, are forced to live in close proximity to one another, and are highly susceptible to infection with Sars-CoV-2. They can also develop pneumonia and die from it. In November 2020, news that the virus had crossed from humans into mink, mutated and then jumped back again sounded alarm bells around the world. “That was a real wake-up call, and I think is why there’s now more emphasis on studying viruses at the human animal interface,” said Hosie. Fortunately, although there have been other mink outbreaks, “so far [mink-related variant viruses] have not shown to be more transmissible or causing more severe impact compared to other circulating Sars-CoV-2,” a report by the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control concluded. Of course, infected farm animals can be quarantined or culled, as millions of mink were. Farm surveillance can also be stepped up and farmworkers kitted out with protective equipment. Vaccination is another option. In March, Russia’s state veterinary service announced that it had approved a Covid-19 vaccine called Karnivak-Kov for use on fur farms or for cats and dogs, after clinical trials on arctic foxes, cats, dogs and mink. The US Department of Agriculture has authorised a vaccine developed by the American animal health company Zoetis for experimental use on a case-by-case basis. Early this year Zoetis agreed to supply San Diego zoo with enough doses to inoculate its great apes after the zoo’s western lowland gorilla troop became ill with Covid. “Since then we’ve had multiple requests from different zoos and conservatories,” said Mahesh Kumar, a senior vice-president of biologics research and development at Zoetis. “I think 100 species of mammals have been vaccinated.” More concerning than farm outbreaks would be evidence of significant transmission among wild animals. Vaccinating them would be impractical, assuming a vaccine even worked in that species. In May the Journal of Virology reported that white-tailed deer, which are native to North, Central and South America, were capable of transmitting the virus to each other. And in August researchers at the US National Wildlife Center in Fort Collins reported that up to a third of white-tailed deer in the US north-east had antibodies to Sars-CoV-2. It is unclear how they became infected. If white-tailed deer really are transmitting the virus to each other in a continued and significant way, that could be problematic – although if a potentially dangerous new variant arose in them, it would still need to be transmitted back to us, and humans don’t tend to spend a lot of time breathing the same air as deer. “What we’re really concerned about is the passing back and forth between humans and animals, and to other animals, in a setting where the human population ultimately could be affected,” said Rebecca Fisher, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Texas A&M University. Her greater fear is the virus adapting to wild animals that live in close proximity to humans, such as rodents. Fortunately, rats and mice don’t appear particularly susceptible to Sars-CoV-2 infection at the current time. However, because of the risks involved, it could pay to be vigilant. “The current pandemic is maintained by human [to] human transmission, but we need to keep a watching brief on animals,” said Alan Radford, a professor in veterinary health informatics at the University of Liverpool. For now, the most likely source of new variants is continued circulation of the virus in humans. With ongoing high infection rates, we still present a far greater risk to our pets than they do to us. This is unfortunate. “When we’re sick or convalescing, what is better than a snuggle with our pets?” said Fisher. “Tough as it is, if we are sick we must try to not interact with them, and not pass anything on to them. We need to try our hardest to protect them, just as we would our human children.”",News/World news,From hippos to hamsters: how Covid is affecting creatures great and small,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/11/from-hippos-to-hamsters-how-covid-is-affecting-creatures-great-and-small

12/11/2021,"Nearly half of all disadvantaged pupils in England could be prevented from going to university under government plans for a minimum GCSE entry level for higher education, university leaders are warning. Vice-chancellors believe that the government is poised to introduce a new entry threshold for a place on university courses as a means of reining in its rising student loan debt, with outstanding loans reaching £140bn last year. They are expecting the government to announce that students will not be eligible for a student loan unless they have at least a level 4 (the equivalent of an old grade C) in maths and English at GCSE.  An analysis of Department for Education (DfE) GCSE results data conducted by the Million Plus group of modern universities and given to the Guardian shows that under the plan, 48% of all disadvantaged students in England would be ineligible for a student loan to pay the £9,250-a-year fees. Prof Rama Thirunamachandran, chair of Million Plus and vice-chancellor of Canterbury Christ Church University, said: “This policy entrenches inequality between rich and poor, north and south and black and white. It is introducing an 11-plus type system by the back door.” The government’s figures show that 52% of disadvantaged young people get grade 4 in English and maths GCSE compared with the national average of 71%. “So you are almost saying to a generation of disadvantaged kids: ‘You can’t get a student loan,’” said Thirunamachandran. “That is embedding inequality, not levelling up.” Million Plus analysed GCSE results in maths and English by parliamentary constituency and found the policy would hit young people in poorer areas of northern England far harder than in wealthier areas in the south. Under the proposed threshold, for instance, 54% of pupils in Great Grimsby would be ineligible for a student loan, as would 50% in Leeds Central, 49% in Bootle, Knowsley and Nottingham North, and 47% in Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough. In contrast, in the south only 12% of pupils would be excluded in Hitchin and Harpenden, 14% in St Albans, and 15% in London and Westminster, Chipping Barnet, and Richmond Park. Thirunamachandran, said: “The question is, if you are a parent in one of these less privileged regions in the north, will you simply accept that your child doesn’t have the same right to go to university as someone in a more privileged place in the south? That’s the political gamble the government is taking.” It is thought that the government believes many voters would consider it reasonable to expect students to have a good level of numeracy and literacy, making the idea a politically safe way to reduce student numbers. Claire Callender, professor of higher education at Birkbeck University and University College London’s Institute of Education, said: “This is a cap on student numbers through the back door – but not a cap on all potential students, just the most disadvantaged and those most affected by Covid.” She argued that a minimum entry level requirement signalled “an abandonment of any government concern about widening HE participation and nurturing social mobility” and said it would “cement existing social divides amongst young people at a time when they are widening rather than narrowing”. Sir David Bell, a former permanent secretary in the DfE and now vice-chancellor of Sunderland University, said the entry threshold would be seen as “a cap on aspiration”. “Politicians and policymakers always underestimate that really deeply felt aspiration to get to university,” he said. “They often falsely assume that people in a city like Sunderland just don’t want to go, but it’s simply not the case.” In its interim response to the Augar review of post-18 education in January the government said: “We are currently too skewed towards degrees above all else.” And last year the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, accused universities of “taking advantage” of disadvantaged students by mis-selling them dumbed-down courses that left them saddled with debt. Bell said the idea that universities are interested only in “piling students in” like “cash cows” was “offensive and unfair”. “We genuinely want them to succeed,” he added. “It is universities like ours that do the majority of the heavy lifting on social mobility.” He said universities such as his were very experienced in making nuanced decisions about applicants’ potential, and whether they would cope with a degree course. Sunderland takes a high proportion of mature students, many of whom do not have traditional qualifications and would be excluded under the proposed new system. Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, who is leading a research project on how to help those who leave school without basic literacy or numeracy, said: “This is effectively closing off university prospects at age three for many poorer children. Our research shows the depressingly strong link between achieving poorly in early-age tests and failing to get passes in English and maths GCSEs at age 16.” Children from the lowest fifth of family income backgrounds are five times more likely to leave school without passes in English and maths GCSEs than those from the highest fifth of incomes, his research shows. “This move exposes the fundamental flaw at the heart of our education system: we already label a third of pupils taking English and maths GCSEs as failures – this will only condemn them further,” Elliot Major said. Academic staff at modern universities also say courses such as paramedicine, nursing and social care would all lose students under the proposed model, just as England is experiencing staff shortages in these professions. Dr Signy Henderson, dean for student success at Cumbria University, said its paramedic science degree would suffer. “We all know how desperately the country needs more well-qualified paramedics,” she said. “We often have learners who have real potential, but who went to schools where they say no one pushed them, or grew up in homes where no one understood the value of good GCSEs.” The DfE said it would not comment on speculation about discussions around minimum grade requirements and possible exemptions, which it said were ongoing. However, a spokesperson said: “This is a government that has boosted aspirations and grown opportunities for disadvantaged people across the country, and this year a record proportion of disadvantaged students has started university as a result. We are committed to continuing to level up opportunity.” He added: “But we also want to make getting on as important as getting in, which is why last month we asked universities to reboot their widening access plans with ambitious targets to support students both before and during their time at university, by reducing dropout rates and improving progression into high-paid, high-skilled jobs for disadvantaged students.”",News/Education,Fears half of poorer pupils in England could be barred from university,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/11/universities-warn-gcse-demand-threat-disadvantaged-pupils
