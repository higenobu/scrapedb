3/10/2022,"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned a Russian attack on a children’s hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol as evidence of “genocide” as the US moved to drastically bolster support to the war-ravaged country with a $13.6bn aid package. The Ukrainian president shared video footage showing massive destruction at the hospital – a combined 600-bed complex with children’s and maternity wards – in the southern port city that has been under relentless bombardment for nine days. “A children’s hospital, a maternity ward. How did they threaten the Russian Federation? What is this country, the Russian Federation, that is afraid of hospitals, maternity wards and is destroying them?” said Zelenskiy on Telegram. “Hospitals and schools are destroyed. Churches and ordinary buildings are destroyed. People are killed. Children are killed. The aerial bombing of a children’s hospital is the ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening.” The White House condemned the attack as “barbaric” while US House lawmakers voted to rush through a $13.6bn aid package that would increase military and humanitarian support to Ukraine and its European allies. The aid includes $6.5bn for the US costs of sending troops and weapons to eastern Europe and equipping allied forces there, and $6.8bn to care for refugees and provide economic support to allies. Senate approval is expected within days. The House also passed a bill banning Russia oil imports. US House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she talked to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for 45 minutes on Wednesday. She said they discussed the weapons and other assistance his country needs and “the crimes against humanity that [Vladimir] Putin is committing”, including the maternity hospital air strike. “This is the beast that Putin is,” Pelosi said. Pelosi indicated the $13.6bn US aid package was likely to be just the tip of a much broader aid effort. “All of us will have to do more” to help Ukraine in coming weeks or months and over the long term to help it rebuild, Pelosi said, referring to the US and Nato allies. The US meanwhile warned Russia could be preparing to use chemical or biological weapons in the war. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that Russia had been making “false claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine”, and added that the allegations had been echoed in Beijing. “Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” she tweeted. The concerns came as UK intelligence highlighted the strength of the Ukrainian resistance. In an update on Thursday, Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the large Russian column north-west of Kyiv had made “little progress in over a week” and suffers continued losses at the hands of Ukraine forces. The MoD said there had been a noticeable drop in Russian air activity in recent days, likely due to the “unexpected effectiveness” of the Ukraine forces. It also said Russia has deployed conscript troops despite assurances from Putin not to do so. As the Russian president seeks to regain momentum, local authorities described the damage to the Mariupol hospital as “colossal” and said women in labour were among the wounded. A local official said the attack injured at least 17 staff, though no deaths were immediately reported. Zelenskiy said the “direct strike by Russian troops” had left children under the wreckage. The deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said Mariupol was being shelled continuously and 1,170 residents had died, 47 of whom were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday. “It’s medieval,” he said. “It’s pure genocide. The attack isn’t simply treacherous. It’s a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.” The Guardian was unable to fully verify the Ukrainian officials’ accounts, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack. The Red Cross has described conditions in the port city as “apocalyptic”, while deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the situation was “catastrophic”. Zelenskiy compared the devastation and suffering there to that caused by the Nazis. Journalists have described corpses lying unburied in the streets and hungry residents breaking into stores in search of food, and melting snow for water while thousands sheltered in basements. The Russian army had also “shot and bombed” a humanitarian corridor agreed with Moscow and intended to allow civilians a safe route out, the deputy mayor of the city said, mined the road, and installed a checkpoint. Of an estimated 200,000 people desperate to leave, only 2,000 to 3,000 a day were able to. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy said at least 35,000 civilians were able to leave the cities of Sumy, Enerhodar and areas around Kyiv. He said he hoped the evacuations would continue on Thursday with three more routes set to open out of Mariupol, Volnovakha in the south-east and Izyum in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskiy said on Wednesday the threat level against the country was “at the maximum” and again called on the west to impose a no-fly zone, saying it risked a “humanitarian catastrophe” if it did not. Speaking in Washington, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, reiterated the Nato position that a no-fly zone would bring Nato into direct conflict with Russia. The conflict has also raised fears of a nuclear accident in a country with major nuclear plants and the site of the Chernobyl disaster. The UN’s atomic watchdog said Wednesday it saw “no critical impact on safety” at Chernobyl, location of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986, despite a loss of power there. But it warned it was not receiving updates from either Chernobyl or Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, which is also now under Russian control. The UK said the Russians had confirmed the use of a thermobaric rocket system. The weapons, also known as vacuum bombs, suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion. Three rounds of peace talks between the two sides have so far yielded no progress, with Moscow continuing to insist Ukraine must “demilitarise” and enshrine neutrality in its constitution before it halts what it calls a “special military operation” aimed at ensuring Russia’s security. Moscow insisted on Wednesday it would prefer to reach its goals through negotiation. In other developments: Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has landed in Turkey for the face-to-face talks on Thursday with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, the highest-level meeting between the two countries since Russia invaded. Kuleba warned in a Facebook video his expectations were “limited”. So far, the parties have been engaged in lower-level talks in Belarus, largely over humanitarian issues and involving only Ukrainian officials. Leaders of the 27-nation EU are to meet in Versailles on Thursday and Friday. A draft declaration prepared for the summit said: “Russia’s war of aggression constitutes a tectonic shift in European history.” The leaders are expected to discuss reducing the bloc’s energy dependency on Russia, and Ukraine’s request to join the EU The US is weighing sanctions on nuclear power supplier Rosatom, a senior Biden administration official said on Wednesday.

3/10/2022,"The UK has “sleepwalked” into a dysfunctional market for children’s social care with local authorities forced to pay excessive fees for privately run services that often fail to meet the needs of vulnerable children, an official report has concluded. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) called for an overhaul of the £6.5bn UK market for children’s residential and foster care, saying it had found “significant problems” with the provision of the privately dominated services. Private companies were too often failing to provide the right services in the right places, it said, with children frequently placed in homes miles from where they live, often separated from their siblings, and unable to access care and therapies they need. More than a third of children in England in residential placements were placed at least 20 miles from their home base, away from friend and family networks, while one in six siblings were placed in separate homes, contrary to their care plan. Authorities across the UK told the CMA that it was especially difficult to find placements for older children and those with more complex needs. Private providers in England account for 75% of children’s homes. Lack of an appropriate children’s home placement meant some young people were placed illegally in unregulated settings, the CMA reported. Profit margins were “materially higher than expected”, the competition regulator said, with the largest residential home providers posting 22.6% in recent years on prices that averaged more than £150,000 a year for each place. Private fostering agencies were chalking up average profit margins of 20% a year. The CMA said while the quality of most private services appeared to be good, many providers – especially those owned by private equity groups – were carrying highly risky levels of debt. Were a private provider to go bust “in a disorderly manner”, local authorities could struggle to find alternative accommodation for children, it said. Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA, said: “The UK has sleepwalked into a dysfunctional children’s social care market. This has left local authorities hamstrung in their efforts to find suitable and affordable placements in children’s homes or foster care.” The CMA urged the government to step up oversight of private providers of care, help local authorities to improve the way they manage care markets and support councils to set up more in-house fostering agencies to compete with private companies. It noted that that while recruiting and retaining staff for children’s homes was a “significant barrier” to the creation of new provision, the high levels of profit generated privately meant it was “perhaps surprising that wages have not risen” or greater investment made in training staff. However, it stopped short of banning for-profit care or imposing price or profit caps on private providers. It said there was no evidence that state provision of children’s homes would be any cheaper, and the capital costs of building a new generation publicly owned homes would be major, and require “significant political intervention”. A government review of the planning system was necessary, it said, to overcome frequent local public opposition to new children’s homes, “most of which appears to be based on outmoded or inaccurate assumptions about children’s homes and looked-after children”. There have been widespread concerns – including from the government-commissioned review of children’s social care – about the sustainability of the children’s social care market after big rises in the numbers of looked-after children over the past decade, coupled with growing pressures on local authority budgets as a result of austerity funding cuts. The Department for Education was approached for comment.",News/Society,"UK has ‘sleepwalked’ into dysfunctional children’s social care market, says regulator",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/10/uk-sleepwalked-into-dysfunctional-childrens-social-care-market-cma
3/10/2022,"Shares in a steel company that is 29% owned by Roman Abramovich have been suspended on the London Stock Exchange by the City watchdog, after the UK government imposed sanctions on the Russian oligarch over his links to the Kremlin. Evraz itself has not joined the list of Russian firms – such as Gazprom and Sberbank – whose shares have been suspended as a result of facing sanctions themselves. But the Financial Conduct Authority said trading in the shares had been halted “pending clarification of the impact of UK sanctions”. Abramovich’s UK assets have been frozen, meaning he cannot sell his 29% stake in the London-listed steel and coal company unless sanctions are lifted. It came a day after Evraz issued a statement to its investors in which it distanced itself from Abramovich and two other directors, as well as cancelling a shareholder payout that would have been worth $210m (£160m) to the Chelsea FC owner. Evraz said on Wednesday that it could not be certain whether three major shareholders – Abramovich, Alexander Abramov and Alexander Frolov – would be seen as persons “connected with Russia” for the purposes of sanctions law. It added that, regardless of their investment in the company, Evraz “does not consider itself to be an entity owned by, or acting on behalf or at the direction of, any persons connected with Russia”. The company also said it had not made any loans to the men since 1 March, when the UK issued financial sanctions against multiple Russian entities and individuals. The company will retain the dividend worth $729m to shareholders, which was due to be paid on 30 March. Abramovich’s share of the payout would have been worth $210m based on his 29% stake. James Rutherford stepped down as a non-executive director of Evraz on Friday.

3/10/2022,"Body of Work is “a feelgood show”, Hannah Gadsby tells us. Its predecessors, the smash hits Nanette and Douglas, shot the Tasmanian to stardom – but weren’t all smiles. Her latest, recounting romance and recent marriage to her producer Jenney Shamash, arrives with a lighter, looser vibe. Even looser than intended, perhaps. Gadsby enters in a wheelchair, having broken her leg on a trip to Iceland. That poleaxed her European tour, and restricted recent gigs to venues with adequate disability access. So “I haven’t done this very much”, she tells us: the show might be a little rough and unready. By the end, as Body of Work ambled towards the two-hour mark, I could see Gadsby’s point. In a show that makes much of the distinction between storytelling and merely listing things that happened (Gadsby’s dad is apparently a poor raconteur), I missed the structural rigour of her earlier offerings. And yet, this is still a delightful set, the more so for finding the 44-year-old in such happy, playful form. Gadsby hates romcoms, she tells us – but delivers one here, after a fashion, covering her courtship with “Jenno”, flashing back to her relationship history (drolly characterised less as “baggage”, more as a tangle of tote bags), then depicting the pair’s life as a couple, with Jenno smoothing the autistic, perimenopausal, post-famous Gadsby’s path into domesticated middle age. Post-famous? One section reflects on how poorly prepared Gadsby was when celebrity came calling, and how she “fucked it up” via socially maladroit encounters with Jodie Foster and Richard Curtis. After criticising him for broadcasting Dave Chappelle’s transphobic special, there’s a tirade too against Netflix’s Ted Sarandos, which she suspects might burn any remaining bridges to global stardom. As that routine suggests, Gadsby’s spikiness hasn’t deserted her. But Body of Work foregrounds her homely side, as she tells her tale of new love (with droll reference to the bizarre romantic standards of heterosexuals) and conjures her parents to vividly eccentric life. If momentum dwindles towards the end, this remains a winning return for Gadsby, to whose heavy-hitting accomplishments can now be added a flair for comedy with a light heart.

3/10/2022,"Major shortcomings persist in England and Wales’s police forces, the outgoing chief inspector of constabulary has warned, as he said one of the most important missions was to “rebuild public trust”. Sir Tom Winsor, in his ninth and final annual review, said that police must confront a series of problems, including the aftermath of Sarah Everard’s murder by a police officer, if damage to confidence is be restored. He said that while focus has been on failings in the Met because of the murder of Everard and other recent scandals, problems persist in other forces, which must also be rooted out. His comments came in a wide-ranging report that also says: Fraud has “exploded” and continues to be wrongly treated as a low priority by many forces. The model of local accountability, involving police and crime commissioners, has fractured some relationships between police and politicians, and left some chief constables lacking in confidence in their operational independence. The speed with which the government has tried to recruit 20,000 officers, in line with the Conservative manifesto, means there is a “heightened danger” that people unsuited to policing may get through. The “fragile architecture” of having 43 police forces, devised in 1962 and implemented in 1974, is “very far from fit for purpose” in the 2020s. Online crime is now by far the most prevalent type of crime. “It used to be that children were seen as unsafe out on the streets. Now they may be more at risk in their own bedrooms,” he said. Public expectations to fight crime cannot be met without sufficient funding and “the public through their politicians must decide how much threat, harm and risk they are prepared to tolerate”. Winsor said: “Major shortcomings in policing persist, and these need to be addressed. Criminality is often now complex and far more sophisticated, and investigations can take far longer. If the police continue to use 20th-century methods to try to cope with 21st-century technology, they will continue to fall further and further behind. “The police service cannot meet 100% of public expectations for, say, 70% of their efficient cost. The public, through their elected representatives, must decide how much risk and harm they are prepared to accept, and whether they will pay more for higher levels of public safety. “One of the most important things the police must do, especially in London, is to rebuild public trust, which has recently been damaged. Public confidence in the police is more than precious, it is essential,” he said. The report comes at the end of Winsor’s 10-year stint in the job, which ends in this month. He said: “As I reflect on the past decade in policing, I commend the courage and commitment of police officers and staff across the country. “The severity of the problems that our police service now faces should not be underestimated, but the public should be reassured by the strong, pragmatic and professional approach of police officers and staff.”",News/UK news,"Major shortcomings in England and Wales policing persist, watchdog says",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/10/major-shortcomings-in-england-and-wales-policing-persist-watchdog-says

Tom Curry has also been named in the side after completing the head injury return to play protocols with Jones making three changes in total to the side that overcame Wales. Sinckler has been hampered by a back injury this week but came through individual training on Wednesday and has proved his fitness in Thursday morning’s session. Dombrandt only returned to training on Thursday after testing positive for Covid-19 last week but is named on the bench with Sam Simmonds, as expected, lining up at No 8. Jamie George replaces the injured Luke Cowan-Dickie at hooker and Joe Marchant is preferred to Elliot Daly in the other two changes. Joe Launchbury is named on the bench and is in line for a first appearance in 15 months but while Jones was thought to be considering a 6-2 split among his replacements, he has opted for the more traditional 5-3, meaning there is no place in the matchday squad for Alfie Barbeary. Otherwise there is a settled look to the side as England seek to keep their hopes of topping the Six Nations table alive against Ireland. Sinckler’s availability will be welcomed by Jones given Ireland are without Andrew Porter but have called on the experience of Cian Healy. Dombrandt excelled against Wales but was always unlikely to start given his positive Covid test so the fact he is ready for a place on the bench is a similarly a positive outcome for Jones.

3/10/2022,"The world has a “once in a lifetime” chance to protect the high seas from exploitation, warned scientists and environmentalists, as negotiators meet at the UN headquarters in New York this week to hammer out a new treaty on the oceans. One scientist described the treaty, which will set out a legal framework to protect biodiversity and govern the high seas, as the most significant ocean protection agreement for four decades. “It’s extremely important it happens now,” said Prof Alex Rogers, science director of Rev Ocean, an ocean research NGO. “We’ve continued to see industrialisation of areas beyond national boundaries, including distant-water fishing and potentially deep-sea mining.” A vast portion of the ocean, 64% by surface area, lies outwith the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) that cover approximately 200 nautical miles from the shorelines of individual states. Referred to as the high seas, they host a wide array of ecosystems and species, many insufficiently studied and recorded. The increasing reach of shipping vessels, seabed mining and new activities such as “bioprospecting” of marine species have put the high seas and its biodiversity at increasing risk of exploitation. A group of 50 countries has signed up to the 30x30 coalition, which launched in January 2021 and aims to protect 30% of the planet’s land and sea by 2030. But without an agreement, these much-heralded pledges will have no legal basis in the high seas. Currently, all countries have the right to navigate, fish and carry out scientific research on the high seas with few restrictions. Only 1.2% of this marine area is protected. Jean-Baptiste Jouffray, a researcher at the Stockholm Resilience Centre at Stockholm University who has quantified the rise in human pressures on the marine environment, describes a “blue acceleration”, or dash for resources, over the past two or three decades. “You have a race for the ocean in all these different sectors, but there is no overview.” “One of the fallacies about the high seas is that you have this great big empty space. The other is that it is a quiet space. Both of those are untrue,” said Doug McCauley, associate professor of ocean science at the Benioff Ocean Initiative at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “By all indicators it is busier that it has ever been. Shipping has increased by 1,600% since 1982, when Unclos [the UN law of the sea] was signed. Industrial fishing takes place farther and farther from shore and more than 55% of the ocean is fished. There is new interest in offshore oil and gas. And there is the threat of mining in the deep sea.” McCauley contributed to a paper for the Pew Charitable Trusts highlighting 10 biodiversity hotspots in the high seas that would benefit from protection. They include the Costa Rica Dome – nutrient-rich waters that attract yellowfin tuna, migratory dolphins, endangered blue whales and leatherback sea turtles – and the Emperor Seamount chain, which arches north-west of the Hawaiian islands towards Russia, a highly biodiverse series of seamounts. The paper concludes that, while a patchwork of international bodies and treaties manage resources and human activity in areas beyond national jurisdiction – including fishing, whaling, shipping and seabed mining – they vary greatly in their mandates, and their jurisdictions often overlap. This piecemeal approach “leads to a degradation of the environment and its resources”, said the paper. It also makes setting up marine protected areas legally challenging. “The treaty won’t create protections for hotspots but will hopefully create a structure so that we can create international parks for the first time,” said McCauley. “It’s a starting place and a really important starting place.” Peggy Kalas, of the High Seas Alliance, said: “After decades of negotiations and planning, the world has a once-in-a-generation chance to build meaningful protections for an environment that supports life as we know it. “It is hard to exaggerate how crucial these talks are for the multitrillion-dollar global ocean economy, a vital food source for billions of people and perhaps the best protection the planet has from climate change.” However, NGOs expressed concern over being excluded from this week’s negotiations, after the UN restricted entry to delegates and intergovernmental organisations due to Covid. Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace, which has long campaigned for a network of ocean sanctuaries, said it set a worrying precedent. “These negotiations are simply too important to avoid proper scrutiny; the UN should review its decision and allow civil society to participate in a safe and meaningful way.” The UN general assembly voted on 24 December 2017 to convene a multi-year process to develop a treaty on “the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction”. Three of the scheduled negotiations have taken place. The fourth and final set, previously scheduled for March 2020 but postponed due to Covid, is now running from 7 to 18 March at the UN headquarters in New York. The draft treaty addresses four key areas: marine genetic resources; area-based management tools, including marine protected areas; environmental impact assessments and capacity building; and the transfer of marine technology. Last month, at the One Ocean summit in Brest, France, more than 100 countries, including the UK and 27 members of the EU, agreed to achieve a strong and robust UN high seas treaty, giving the talks a powerful political boost.",News/Environment,UN ocean treaty is ‘once in a lifetime’ chance to protect the high seas,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/un-ocean-treaty-is-once-in-a-lifetime-chance-to-protect-the-high-seas
3/10/2022,"“I like everything here but that swing makes me feel sick.” Leire, seven, has a smile on her face as she pushes her friends Romeo and Gabriel. Despite the cold the three of them have hurried straight to the Grove adventure playground in their school uniforms to start playing. Walk down a quiet back street in Brixton, south London, and the Grove adventure playground appears on the grey skyline as a riot of red, yellow and blue. “When a child walks in they know they are somewhere special,” says Nick Lewis, who helped save the playground from closure a few years ago. Here, children – some of whom may live in flats with little or no outside space – can climb rickety wooden towers, light fires in the communal fire pit and jump in puddles. But although the doors are open, a “Save our Playground” sign hangs in the trees. The Grove is clinging to survival, its constant struggle for funding part of a wider crisis for adventure play, an energetic philosophy born in the years that followed the second world war and inspired by activists who saw how happily children played on bomb sites. “This is a space for play,” says play lead Ashlee Aderele. “We connect children here with nature but they don’t even notice – it’s just here in every corner – the fire, the mud, the wood – they are part of it without noticing because they are playing. “But there isn’t any funding just for having fun. We can get funding from Lambeth council for projects like food for the kids, or for providing sessions for children with special needs, and we are surviving but there is very little money just for play.” Figures from Play England given exclusively to the Guardian show that at least 21 adventure playgrounds have been lost across England since 2017. Their research found 126 sites that matched the description of staffed outdoor play, free for children to attend. This is down from 147 in 2017. Many more have lost direct council funding or have severely reduced their hours or staffing levels. In Crawley, East Sussex, they have closed all four of the town’s adventure playgrounds, despite a local campaign to save them. “It’s heartbreaking,” says playworker and photographer Jeff Pitcher, who was involved in the campaign, but was made redundant when the playgrounds closed. “I went over today to look through the fence at one, Creasys Drive. The play equipment – which only needed minor repairs – has been removed and it’s just a locked expanse of land now.” Pitcher says children need the spaces more than ever. “These playgrounds were built as part of Crawley’s ‘new town’ dream back in the 60s. They were pockets of refuge, where kids could learn how to rub along together and play healthily outdoors. Last summer, in their final days we had 300 families a day across the two most popular sites.” The Guardian spoke to local parents who say the playgrounds are a huge loss. The council says it has “mothballed” two of the sites “pending investigation into future use” and insists they had reached the end of their lives. The two other sites will open as “fixed, unsupervised” play areas later this year. Crawley council argues that the playgrounds were expensive, at around £30 per head, by the time they closed; a figure Pitcher denies. Anita Grant, the head of Play England, says static playgrounds cannot replace the magic of well-run adventure playgrounds. “The loss of 21 adventure playgrounds is 15% of provision, a significant and worrying trend away from the hope that the Blair government generated with its generous play funding in the early 21st century. “These just can’t be compared to ‘fixed’ playgrounds in parks; they are community spaces where thoughtful staff help children engage with nature and play with other children of different ages – an experience we are losing in wider society.” Other local authorities are facing difficult decisions as budgets are cut. In Lewisham, Oxford, Bath, Southampton and Southwark, Play England notes closures or reduced services. There are models of good practice. In Islington, Grant runs six thriving adventure playgrounds with a 15-year funding commitment from the council. The first was started by local mothers in the 50s. At the Grove, occasional grants from charities keep them alive, in particular paying staffing costs. At the heart of the playground is a philosophy of healthy risk. A comical plaque honours a spot where a child broke a bone playing. Aderele watches as Romeo and Gabriel get ready to jump. “That swing often worries them. I take it very slowly. I say: ‘Come on, I’ll hold you.’ The progression to jumping from higher points might take weeks. They are so proud, they say: ‘Oh, can I bring my mum in to see how high I climbed?’ It’s really fun helping children face their fears in the outdoors. I have a job where I just play all the time.”",News/Society,‘It’s heartbreaking’: adventure playgrounds disappearing across England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/10/its-heartbreaking-adventure-playgrounds-disappearing-across-england

3/10/2022,"The Japanese retailer Uniqlo is the latest international brand to suspend its Russian operations in a U-turn after pressure to take action over the war in Ukraine. Earlier this week Fast Retailing, the clothing chain’s owner, said it intended to keep its Russian shops open because clothing was a “necessity of life”, even as a string of brands from McDonald’s and Starbucks to Burberry and Asos suspended operations in the country. On Thursday, Fast Retailing issued a statement saying it was suspending its operations as it had “recently faced a number of difficulties, including operational challenges and the worsening of the conflict situation”. The company said it still believed making “everyday clothing available to the general public in Russia” was part of its mission but it had become clear it could no longer continue to do so because of the difficulties involved. “Our thoughts are with the people who are suffering today, and we will do whatever we can to support them during these very tragic times. We wish for the return of peace and stability as quickly as possible,” the company said. Fast Retailing previously announced a donation of $10m to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, to help people fleeing Ukraine. It also said employees in Europe had been helping deliver clothing to refugees. A host of international brands have suspended operations in Russia amid financial sanctions and public pressure in western countries to support Ukraine. Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Pepsi joined McDonald’s in pausing operations on Tuesday, as well as Netflix, Levi’s, Burberry and Ikea. The owner of KFC and Pizza Hut said it was suspending the operations of 70 KFC company-owned restaurants in Russia and finalising an agreement to suspend all 50 Pizza Hut outlets in partnership with its master franchisee. On Wednesday, Mothercare, Heineken, the UK tobacco firm Imperial Brands and Universal Music Group also joined the exodus. Unilever, the owner of Marmite and Ben & Jerry’s, said it had suspended imports and exports to Russia but continued to supply essential food and hygiene products made in the country to locals.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Uniqlo suspends operations in Russia in unexpected U-turn,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/10/uniqlo-suspends-operations-russia-u-turn-fashion
3/10/2022,"The default tone of The Adam Project, Free Guy director Shawn Levy’s second sci-fi lite offering with Ryan Reynolds in as many years, is apiece with any other Reynolds film: quippy one-liners leavening a stressful situation. “Time travel exists, you just don’t know it yet,” we’re told in the opening shot, as an adult Adam Reed, another Reynolds-standard – a generically handsome, witty nice guy – steals a plane in the year 2050. Spitting comebacks even as he’s under fire in space – the graphics here (invisible ships!) seem decent for Netflix but still best suited for a small screen – Adam opens up a wormhole and crash-lands somewhere outside of Seattle in 2022. Adult Adam, wounded and four years off from his target (the year 2018, to be later explained), blows up the life of his 12-year-old self (Walker Scobell), an asthmatic, caustic small fry reeling from the recent loss of his scientist father Louis (Mark Ruffalo). Scobell, with his reedy voice, soft brown eyes and flop of blonde hair, is endearing despite having to muddle through lines that feel generated from a Reynolds bot – chirpy, deeply annoying comebacks to his wearied mother Ellie (an underused Jennifer Garner) or a pair of archetypical school bullies. Little Adam is an aerospace nerd with a strong grasp of Back to the Future references, which is the best way to view this film: a high-concept but thin homage to light-hearted sci-fi romps of the past. Packaged with a prestige Netflix film budget (and filmed on location in Vancouver), The Adam Project offers a buffet of family friendly hooks – slickly choreographed action sequences with invisible fighters of the future, booming score, the baseline emotional pull that is the passage of time – that make little sense if you think at all about it, which is not really the point. It’s spectacle coasting on the evergreen draw of time travel paced with beats of occasionally effective human emotion – grief, regret, self-loathing and acceptance in sometimes moving, very manageable amounts. The script by Jonathan Tropper, Mark Levin, Jennifer Flackett and TS Nowlin attempts the necessary explanations of 1) how time travel is possible and, more pressingly, 2) what happens when past and future self meet, which isn’t well explained beyond “the prevailing wisdom is: not good,” though that’s ultimately not necessary to appreciate a caper such as this. The Adams –12-year-old Adam in his “fixed time” (one’s natural untampered timeline, so 2022) and 40-year-old Adam from 2050 – are tasked with finding Adam’s future/current wife Laura (Zoe Saldana), who was possibly sabotaged into a 2018 trap (this all gets mind-bendy very fast, better to turn brain onto cruise control). The mission quickly morphs to saving the future from the time-travel exploitation of Louis’s former patron, of-the-moment villainess tech CEO Maya Sorian (Catherine Keener), shot through with several time travel ethics questions used more as props than guideposts. Enjoyment of The Adam Project will depend heavily on one’s tolerance for Reynolds’ well-established schtick, seeing as its doubled here into two schticks bouncing off each other. As in, nerdy Adam marvels at buff adult Adam’s muscles and is massively relieved that he one day gets laid. If the lilt of a tamer Deadpool or, of course, Free Guy are your thing, then The Adam Project will be more of your wheelhouse. What does work, for me at least, are the sappy yet effective depictions of loss and the basic human ache for a little bit more control over the relentless march forward. Who hasn’t wished at some point to go back in time and savor a simple moment again, tell someone you loved them one more time, cheat death for an hour or two? The Adam Project benefits from the presence of Garner, always good as a mom with a deep well of compassion, and Ruffalo – no stranger to blockbuster action humor as the Avengers’ Hulk – who elevates the role of the Adams’ workaholic father. At just under two hours, The Adam Project is stuffed with cheerfully indecipherable plot twists (nuclear reactors, crystals, equations) and mind scramblers (older characters manipulating their younger selves, variations of the butterfly effect). But it’s all at a competent, polished remove – complicated enough to get invested if you want, but built for passive enjoyment. The Adam Project may gesture at the grand world of time travel physics, but it’s actually quite a simple formula.

3/10/2022,"The last thing I’d ever want to do is lecture my “elders and betters” (as my grandmother called the older generation) about their behaviour. We oldies already know how to stay happy and healthy. We’ve had our jabs, we take our exercise, we’ve given up smoking and we eat our greens. So we don’t need any young whippersnapper – or worse, elderly TV presenter – to tell us what to do. But I have learned an important lesson in the two years since Covid hit, and I thought maybe others could benefit from it too. It’s about the internet. My generation is very wary of the internet – a view I understand and, to an extent, share. Every day there are new warnings about the dangers of cyberspace: the scams and the swindlers targeting older people. Callers to the Silver Line helpline, which I founded a decade ago as a resource for older people, often say that trying to navigate this jungle with a mouse, a keyboard and a mystifying screen is a challenge that has defeated them. In a 2019 Office for National Statistics survey, less than half of over-75s said that they had recently used the internet. That wouldn’t be such a problem, except that so many things are now migrating online – and technology’s triumphant march is leaving an awful lot of older people very isolated. Take shopping. My grandmother enjoyed pottering around the high street, exchanging gossip with shopkeepers who would greet her by name, ask after her family, and recognise and value her. Now, my high street is a tangle of charity shops and a few remaining chainstores and supermarkets. The human face has been replaced by a click on a screen. Even before the pandemic, Age UK found that in England, 1.4 million older people often felt lonely. It’s not easy to admit, because loneliness carries a stigma. The word we hear most often from callers to the Silver Line helpline is the “b” word – “burden”. One wrote anonymously to me that since she lost her husband of 54 years, she sometimes goes “for three days at a time without talking to anyone. I am an optimist by nature and sometimes I need that to get through another pointless day when I feel as if I am a waste of space.” No wonder loneliness causes serious damage to mental and physical health. I do not believe that there is a magic bullet to combat loneliness. But having seen how technology was cutting off older people, I learned to my surprise during lockdown that it could also offer a solution. When we were unable to meet face to face, it brought my family and friends into my home. We couldn’t travel, or hug, but still every day we could laugh, chat and send each other pictures. Work continued – I attended weekly meetings via FaceTime and Skype. If only Boris Johnson had realised, as I did, that he could use Zoom to hold parties. It’s convenient, easy, and I still do it. Even though I live deep in a forest, I still feel connected with the outside world, and the skills I learned during lockdown continue to prove their value to me day by day. The key is getting started. The University of the Third Age, U3A, conducted tutorials during lockdown to encourage members to use the internet, to upskill them and to have fun. In one session, 80 ukulele-playing U3A members joined in a virtual jam session. When Covid first drove me out of London into the wild beauty of the New Forest, I had only a very fragile three kilometres of copper wire linking my laptop with the outside world, so Zoom and Teams conferences and streaming video were impossible. I became only too aware how crucial high-quality broadband is. Even when, after six months, this did reach our village, I still had to learn how to actually use Zoom and Skype, but once you invent memorable passwords (and learn how to reinvent them when, as inevitably happens, they become unmemorable) they become your best friends. The good news I have discovered from the last 18 months of Zooming is that you only have to look respectable down to the waist, so you can spend the day in comfy slippers. And shopping online turns every day into Christmas as parcels arrive you have no memory of ordering but turn out to be exactly what you wanted, at least some of the time. And if you occasionally forget to unmute yourself, doesn’t everyone? It’s up to us oldies to take the first step. If any of us feel excluded or confused by technology, we must swallow our pride and ask for help. We need to encourage our friends, families, charities and volunteers to guide and mentor us into the brave new world. I suspect it will be far easier than we fear: if we can type, we can use a computer. And it’s worth it. A review of the literature on the impact of the internet on older people found lots of evidence for “the positive effect of computer use on the psychological functioning and wellbeing of the older adults”, and that internet use “has also been associated with decreased loneliness and depression, better social connectedness, self-esteem and cognitive functioning, improved self-efficacy, self-control, self-determination, social interaction, education and skills development”. Yes, there are new dangers, but any adventure has its risks. I would remind any reluctant fellow oldies that the invention of the car meant learning to drive, memorising the Highway Code, and fastening our seatbelts in order to stay safe. The same applies to navigating the internet: it’s a challenge at first, but it’s worth it. Like the car, the internet enables us to explore the world, to join our friends and loved ones, to celebrate together. And if at first the computer defeats us, it’s a wonderful excuse to ring up our grandchildren and ask them for help.

3/10/2022,"It takes exactly 31 seconds from the start of his third album for Alex O’Connor to inform listeners that he’s feeling both stressed and “so depressed”. Those familiar with O’Connor’s oeuvre as Rex Orange County might suggest that’s very much par for the course. Feeling stressed and depressed is O’Connor’s thing. He’s stressed and depressed about girls, about his friendships, about his burgeoning musical career and, on a song called 7am, about forgetting to shut the blinds before he went to bed. He even has a weird habit of sounding upset when he’s ostensibly hymning a blossoming new romance, striking an oddly pleading tone: “I can’t believe you’ve come and saved me.” Even by the standards of sensitive “sad boi” singer-songwriters – none of them exactly big on impenetrable imagery and extended metaphors – O’Connor writes about his feelings in a curiously direct and unadorned way. Set to simple piano accompaniments that are often noticeably perkier than their subject matter, his lyrics frequently resemble too-much-information social media posts arranged into rhyming couplets and verses. (“So you want to be happy too? / What are you supposed to do?” he sings on Who Cares?’s title track.) In his back catalogue lurks a song about feeling stressed out called Stressed Out. He also has a song about feeling timid called Never Had the Balls and a song about being sad called A Song About Being Sad. By contrast, Ed Sheeran looks like Mark E Smith. This, one suspects, is the secret of Rex Orange County’s considerable success: his back catalogue is thick with singles that have gone gold or platinum without actually making the charts, a discombobulating phenomenon that indicates an awful lot of streams spread over a long period of time. As has been established thoroughly in recent years, what a lot of teen and tween listeners now want from pop is relatability, and they come no more relatable than O’Connor with his boy-next-door image, his unvarnished diary-entry lyrics and his frequent suggestions that stardom is all a bit much and he’d be happier living a more normal life: “I’m not cut out for this and I keep wanting to call it quits,” he sings on 7am. If you want an indication of the age group his music attracts, he’s about to release an expanded “anniversary” edition of his album Apricot Princess, celebrating not its 20th birthday, or even its 10th, but its fifth. Snort if you want at the idea of mistily recalling the halcyon era of 2017, but for a sizable chunk of his audience, five years ago probably does seem like the distant past – a time when the older ones were still studying for their GCSEs and the younger ones were still at primary school – and a simpler one at that. Musically, there’s a hint of vintage soul music about his approach on Who Cares?: the squelchy synth bass on Open a Window could have stepped off an early 80s R&B hit. There is in the construction of Shoot Me Down a barely perceptible hint of Oasis in ballad mode, specifically Stop Crying Your Heart Out. But with his tasteful string arrangements, his electric piano and his mid-Atlantic accent – “I’m alone witchoo,” he cries, as people from Hampshire villages so often do – what O’Connor really recalls is the poppier end of 70s soft rock: Andrew Gold, Leo Sayer, Dean Friedman. For all the 2020s sheen, the samples and the guest appearance from Tyler, the Creator (O’Connor guested on his album Flower Boy in the halcyon era of 2017), it doesn’t take a huge leap of imagination to picture him singing most of Who Cares? on Top of the Pops, perched at a keyboard in a cheesecloth shirt, before an audience waiting patiently for Showaddywaddy to come on and liven things up. Like his soft-rock forebears, at his best O’Connor seems to be part of a lineage of pop craftsmen for whom melody trumps everything – you don’t need edge, experimentation or lyrical fireworks if you can come up with a tune as strong as Open the Window or as cute as Making Time. But at his worst, it sounds limp and insubstantial, compounded by the thin production (a sonic link to the days when O’Connor was uploading his bedroom-recorded songs to Soundcloud) and his voice, which can tend to the nasal and whiny. The effect is often oddly flattening: “I kept opening my door just to see if you would walk through,” he sings on The Shade, sounding less like a man temporarily rendered irrational by love than someone waiting for a Deliveroo. It’s music so redolent of the current appetite for safe pop, and of a specific audience, that you wonder what the future holds for O’Connor. Perhaps he’ll grow and develop alongside his fans. Perhaps he’ll come good on one of his many threats to pack it all in. Right now, though, he’s engaged in giving people exactly what they want. If success really makes him as unhappy as he keeps claiming it does, he’s clearly going to be stressed and depressed for the foreseeable future: more unvarnished grist to the songwriting mill.

3/10/2022,"For a couple of years after those golden arches first appeared in Moscow on 31 January 1990, McDonald’s was a really big deal in Russia. It was more than a food experience. It was an exotic destination of devout pilgrimage. In 1992, I was living in St Petersburg for the summer to study Russian. I had travelled to Moscow on the overnight train with a group of Russian friends. The first thing I wanted to do – being in Moscow for the first time in my life – was to see Red Square as the sun came up. My friends had other ideas about the most important port of call. We had to go straight to McDonald’s and get a Beeg Mak or – just as exciting – a gamburger. (Actual Russian word.) There was no point in standing in their way. The Kremlin would have to wait. This week, McDonald’s announced that it would be suspending its operations in Russia. This affects 847 branches and 62,000 employees, who will continue to be paid. The company’s president and CEO Chris Kempczinski said: “Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine.” The response echoes the actions of dozens of brands from Chanel and Burberry to Apple and Starbucks. Once upon a time three decades ago, the arrival of McDonald’s in Moscow represented the end of the cold war and the triumph of the joys of capitalism. On that first day in 1990, that first branch on Pushkinskaya Square expected to serve around 1,000 customers. But even before opening time, a line of 5,000 Russians was snaking round the block. As Russian customers explained to the western media covering the event, the queue was not a big deal. Queueing was something they were very used to. Customers marvelled at the size of the milkshakes. Some kept Big Mac boxes and other packaging to re-use at home because it was such a precious novelty. Others shook their heads at the outrageous prices. At 3 roubles and 75 kopecks, a Big Mac was the equivalent of half a day’s wages, costing the equivalent of $6.25 at the time – the most expensive McDonald’s in the world. It is hard to overstate the frenzy around consumer experiences in the very early post-Soviet days. By the time that Mikhail Gorbachev left office in 1991, western brands such as Dunkin’ Donuts, Baskin-Robbins and Nesquik were becoming household names and were a source of curiosity, excitement and, sometimes, suspicion. (Gorbachev was later criticised for his appearance in a 1998 advert for Pizza Hut that was only shown in the United States.) This was at a time when western visitors would still be stopped in the street and asked if they wanted to trade their Levi’s. For a brief period in the early 90s, you would perhaps be the only foreigner Russians had ever met in person. When I went to live in Russia the year after my first visit, return trips home would be dominated by long shopping lists of things Russians wanted: washing powder, tights, makeup, always jeans. These things were starting to become available but they weren’t always good quality or easy to get hold of. As a foreigner, I was also regarded as a handy source of information about new brands being advertised on television. The nine-year-old sister of one of my friends would quiz me on this relentlessly. Was Bounty really the taste of paradise? What did that mean? Had I tried Uncle Ben’s rice? How was it different from other rice? Who was Uncle Ben? Was it true that he had been to Russia? It’s almost impossible, 30 years on, to imagine a world with next to no branding and devoid of consumerism. But in the late Soviet period people were used to state restaurants – which often had no food and no visitors – bearing the name “Restaurant” and shops identifying themselves by a giant logo denoting “Bread” or “Fish”. (And often selling items completely other than bread or fish, if indeed they had any items at all.) In this climate, McDonald’s went early and went fast for maximum impact. The company had been in talks with Soviet officials about opening a branch since the mid-70s, so keen was it to get a foothold. But the innocence of the early 90s couldn’t last: Russians soon became demanding and discerning customers. Over the past two decades McDonald’s has had to compete with a growing array of homegrown Russian fast-food brands such as Kroshka Kartoshka (Little Potato), a baked potato emporium with more than 300 branches; Teremok, which also has 300 outlets and specialises in blini, borscht and pelmeni (dumplings); and Shokoladnitsa (Chocolate Girl), a coffee chain with more than 240 branches in the Moscow area alone. This level of competition has influenced the Russia-specific McDonald’s menu, which includes “country-style” potatoes (thick-cut wedges made with Russian potatoes), chicken wings, a non-alcoholic tarragon and mint mojito and the glamorous McShrimp – a Russian McDonald’s exclusive. My own memory of that first Moscow outing makes me smile at the naivety of it all. On that momentous visit, I paid (obviously). My Russian friends ate their way through the menu in reverential, delighted silence, pausing only to sigh with contentment, picturing their bright consumerist future. Then one of them looked up and asked eagerly, “Can we get more ‘s soboy’?” What does that mean, ‘s soboy’?” I asked? It literally means “with oneself”. A long explanation ensued and I finally understood to my horrified astonishment what they meant – “to take away”. They wanted to buy as many items as possible to take home so that everyone they knew could try these delicacies. I tried to explain that this was not the point of McDonald’s. But my protests were in vain. And so, we travelled back 400 miles on an overnight train journey to St Petersburg, transporting the ultimate status symbol: a paper bag of cold gamburgery, soggy and festering in their luxe branded wrappers.",News/Business,Putin’s war has closed every McDonald’s in Russia.

3/10/2022,"Dirty Russian money has polluted British democracy. The Conservatives have taken donations from Vladimir Putin’s chums without asking enough questions about where the cash is coming from. It is time to clean up Londongrad and also to wave goodbye to a burgeoning list of sanctioned oligarchs that now includes the owner of Chelsea, Roman Abramovich. That’s all completely true but it also doesn’t tell the whole story, which is that Russian money is just a part of an annual flow of foreign finance that enables us as a country to run permanent and massive trade deficits, where imports of goods and services are higher than exports. Put simply, we have been happy to take oligarch money so that we can live beyond our means. It is not just them, it is us. There was a time – many decades ago – when trade deficits were a big deal. Politicians used to fret about them. They were front-page news. Famously, a bad set of trade figures was supposed to have cost Labour the 1970 general election (although they probably didn’t). But since the early 1980s, Britain’s trade deficit has got bigger and we have worried about it less. Instead, we worry about why so many of our leading football clubs have foreign owners, or why so many of the utility companies are no longer in UK hands. A little known – but invaluable – government publication called the pink book helps explain why the two things are linked. The pink book provides an in-depth account of Britain’s balance of payments, which divides things up into a current account – which includes imports and exports of goods such as cars and computers, and trade in services such as banking or management consultancy – and a financial account that simply measures flows of money itself in and out of the country. The point about the balance of payments is that it has to balance. Countries such as the UK that run permanent trade deficits have to sell assets to foreign buyers to raise the cash to balance the books. Over time, Britain has run a cumulative trade deficit in goods and services of £1.3tn. But in the pink book that outflow has been matched by financial surpluses – cash – of the same amount. Money we got selling British assets to foreign buyers. The need to import foreign money became more pressing from the 1980s onwards. Britain has not run a surplus on manufactured goods since 1982 but for a time those deficits were more than matched by a surplus on services. But over time the deficit in goods grew bigger, reaching £20bn by 1990, £40bn by 2000 and £98bn by 2010. In 2019, the last year before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, it had climbed to almost £140bn. Increasingly large amounts of foreign capital were needed to offset these deficits. In some cases, this took the form of direct investment in new British factories, such as the car plants set up by Nissan, Toyota and Honda. In some cases, it took the form of international investors owning a bigger share of the companies quoted on the London stock exchange, which has risen from under 4% at the start of the 1980s to 56% currently. But oligarch money was also part of this process. Russians who had got rich from the privatisation of state-owned assets during the 1990s found a home for their money in the London property market. Financially, this was a smart move for them, as the limited number of mansions in Belgravia and Mayfair means prices are only ever going to move in one direction: up. Our economy needed the cash, so we were happy to take it. Russian money – like Middle Eastern oil money – has also found its way into the Premier League. For those football fans wondering why their club used to be owned by local businessmen in the 1970s but is now in the hands of foreign owners, the pink book has the answer. Mark Carney, when he was governor of the Bank of England, said the UK relied on the kindness of strangers to finance its trade deficit and he was quite right. What he might have added was that some of these strangers were pretty dodgy characters. The structure of our economy is simple. For decades Britons have consumed more than they have produced. And over the past 40 years the economy’s centre of gravity has shifted from manufacturing to financial and business services, centred on the City. London’s role as one of the world’s financial hubs has made it easy to attract foreign capital. So while making life as awkward as possible for Putin’s cronies might be a moral necessity given what is happening in Ukraine, two issues need to be addressed. The first is whether the UK should hand back any sequestered assets to any Russian people from whom they were stolen. The second is that even if London ceases to be the destination of choice for mafia bosses and drug dealers, a means will have to be found to balance the books. Logically, this can only be done in a number of ways. The UK can strengthen its manufacturing sector so that goods exports go up. It can do even better in those parts of the service sector where it already performs well, such as management consultancy and architecture. If it does neither of these things, the import bill can be cut by consuming less. Or we can continue as before and accept that large chunks of prime London real estate will forever remain in foreign ownership.

The move, the latest sign of the financial toll the growing competition is taking on the world’s most popular service, follows a round of price rises for UK subscribers in December 2020 and those in Ireland in March last year. Netflix, which has about 14 million UK subscribers and 600,000 in Ireland, according to Ampere Analysis, is to raise the price of its most popular package, which offers simultaneous viewing on two screens, HD and the ability to download shows and films to two devices, to £10.99 a month. It is also raising the price of its basic package for the first time in a decade. The entry-level plan, which allows viewers to watch only one screen at a time and download to one device, will rise by £1 a month to £6.99. The cost of Netflix’s premium plan, which allows Netflix to be watched on up to four different screens at a time and downloads to up to four devices, will increase by £2 a month to £15.99. In Ireland the basic plan will rise by €1 to €8.99, the standard package will increase from €12.99 to €14.99 and the premium tier will rise from €17.99 to €20.99. The price rises, which were expected after a hefty increase for its US subscribers in January, will come into effect immediately for new subscribers. Existing subscribers will get 30 days notice by email, depending on their billing cycle. Netflix said the increases were the inevitable cost associated with maintaining a continual pipeline of new content for viewers amid rising competition from rivals including Amazon’s Prime Video, Disney+ and HBO Max. “We have always been focused on providing our members both quality and clear value for their membership,” said a Netflix spokesperson. “Our updated prices reflect the investment we have made in our service and catalogue and will allow us to continue making the series, documentaries and films our members love as well as investing in talent and the creative industry. We offer a range of plans so members can choose a price that works best for them.” The UK is Netflix’s biggest production base for TV shows and films outside the US with a $1bn annual content spend. Before the two rounds of price rises Netflix’s most popular tier cost £8.99 and its premium plan cost £11.99. Its rival Disney+, which launched in the UK in early 2020, raised its prices from £5.99 to £7.99 last year. The decision was taken after it doubled its content by adding its Star service to Disney+, offering programmes designed to appeal to a wider non-Disney audience, such as Lost, Desperate Housewives, 24 and The X-Files.",News/Media,Netflix raises prices again for subscribers in UK and Ireland,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/10/netflix-prices-subscribers-uk-ireland

3/10/2022,"Weather conditions disrupted the para Alpine skiing at the Winter Paralympics on Thursday as warm temperatures meant that even with an earlier-than-planned start time, the artificial snow at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre was melting as athletes attempted the technically difficult giant slalom course. Temperatures had been forecast to rise to as high as 23C (73F). Austria’s 16-year-old Johannes Aigner secured his second gold and fourth medal overall of these Games in the men’s visually impaired class, finishing 1.68sec ahead of the defending champion, Giacomo Bertagnolli of Italy. The final two runs of Aigner and Bertagnolli pushed Britain’s Neil Simpson into fifth, meaning he could not add to the two medals he has already won in Beijing. And there was heartbreak for the Slovak Marek Kubacka, who finished fourth. Kubacka lost his sight aged nine, and was the only completely blind athlete in the men’s para alpine visually impaired field. In order for him to compete, his guide, Maria Zatovicova, carries a loudspeaker with her that emits a constant sound and her instructions so that he can judge how to follow the course. As a B1 classified athlete, to compensate for the slower speed at which he skis, his clock runs at 60.53% of real time. His margin on missing out on the podium ended up being 1.55sec. In the men’s standing giant slalom, Santeri Kiiveri of Finland won gold by only 0.04sec from Thomas Walsh of the US, who crossed the line appearing to believe that he had done enough to secure the victory. Britain’s James Whitley finished sixth, moving up from 12th at the halfway stage after a sensational second run that saw him leading the event for a time. On the day only the bronze medallist, Arthur Bauchet of France, went faster than Whitley’s second run time of 57.3sec. The final event of the para Alpine skiing on Thursday was the men’s sitting giant slalom, with athletes having to cope with a course that was rutted and cut-up from the earlier runs. That led to a series of crashes, including for Jeroen Kampschreur of the Netherlands on the penultimate run, who looked all set for a medal until losing control. Norway’s Jesper Pedersen made it look easy in the end, with a victory by more than three seconds. Rene de Silvestro of Italy took silver and Liang Zilu won bronze for the hosts. But it was agony for Argentina’s Enrique Plantey, as Pedersen’s finish pushed him off the podium, and he ended up fourth, missing out on his nation’s first ever Winter Paralympics medal. China have consolidated their lead in the medal table, with 31 medals overall, including 10 golds. Canada remain second with seven golds, and Ukraine are third with six. The warm temperatures have caused organisers to reschedule some events on the final three days of the Paralympics. The snowboard banked slalom finals have been moved from Saturday to Friday, and all remaining Alpine skiing events are set to start 90 minutes earlier than previously scheduled. Nevertheless the Games’ vice-president, Yang Shu’an, said: “I can tell you that the snow sports competition in the Winter Paralympics has been very smooth. Athletes, delegations and technical officials are very satisfied. We need to find the window, the best time for our competition schedules. If we encounter the impact of extreme weather, we will immediately start relevant plans.” Conditions can be more controlled in the indoor venues, and at Beijing’s Ice cube, with no chance of qualifying for the semi-finals, the British curling team were playing for pride on Thursday. Gary Smith was deputising for the injured David Melrose, but could not help the team avoid a 6-3 defeat to the defending champions, China, in their morning match. That ensured that the hosts will qualify for the next stage, and results elsewhere mean that Sweden and Canada will join them in Friday’s semi-finals. The British rallied to win their final match 8-4 against Latvia, a result that confirmed Slovakia as the last semi-finalists. It was a rest day for the para ice hockey squads on Thursday, with the cancellation of the seventh/eighth place play-off match, as the expulsion of the Russian squad left only seven teams in the tournament. On Friday the Czech Republic and Italy will play off for fifth place, sandwiched between the two semi-finals: Canada v South Korea and China v the USA.",Sport/Sport,Winter Paralympics: Teenager Aigner wins second gold amid melting snow,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/10/winter-paralympics-melting-snow-warm-beijing-weather
3/10/2022,"The UK is to ease its rigid entry requirements for Ukrainian refugees, meaning those with passports can apply for entry online and only have to give biometric details when they are in the UK, Priti Patel has said. The home secretary’s announcement, responding to an urgent Commons question from her Labour shadow, Yvette Cooper, follows increasing criticism about the bureaucratic delays facing Ukrainians with family ties to the UK. Many have gone to Calais, to find out they could not apply for visas there, and were sent to other cities. A number of UK consular offices had very limited numbers of appointments. From Tuesday, Patel told the Commons, such appointments would no longer be needed for Ukrainian nationals with passports. They could apply remotely and would be told when they could travel. “In short, Ukrainians with passports will be able to get permission to come here fully online from wherever they are, and will be able to give their biometrics once in Britain,” she said. “This will mean that visa application centres across Europe can focus their efforts on helping Ukrainians without passports.” This will only be the case for people with passports, not ID cards, she said. Cooper welcomed the change, but castigated Patel for the system thus far, calling the treatment “a total, total disgrace, bringing shame on to our country”. “I have to say to the home secretary – why does it always take being hauled into the House of Commons to make basic changes to help vulnerable people who are fleeing from Ukraine?” Cooper asked. Cooper queried why the changes were only being made now “when she has had intelligence for weeks, if not months, that she needed to prepare for a Russian invasion of Ukraine”, saying Patel should accept an offer of help from the armed forces. “It is deeply wrong to leave people in this terrible state,” Cooper said. “Our country is better than this. If she can’t get this sorted out, frankly she should hand the job over to somebody else who can.” In her statement, Patel defended the decision to make checks on Ukrainian nationals before they came, saying she had sought advice from the security services before making the change. Replying to Cooper, Patel insisted the government was taking a “pragmatic and agile approach” to visas. It was important for arrivals in the country to have proper documentation, she added, citing the Windrush scandal as an example of the problems that can otherwise occur. Patel has also come under increasing pressure over recent days from fellow Conservative MPs to speed up the visa process. Responding to her statement, a series of Tory backbenchers praised the change of stance but called for more to be done. One, Steve Baker, queried why a visa centre in Warsaw was closed from 5pm at weekdays, and all weekend, while former minister Robert Buckland asked her to better coordinate UK officials in the response, calling it “a crisis that will not wait”. While EU nations are allowing Ukrainian nationals to stay long-term without visas, the only routes to the UK are existing ones, either for people with family ties, or if they are sponsored by an individual or organisation.",News/World news,"UK to ease entry requirements for Ukrainian refugees, says Priti Patel",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/10/uk-to-ease-entry-requirements-for-ukrainian-refugees-says-priti-patel

3/10/2022,"Good morning. The US has moved to drastically step up its support for Ukraine, with House lawmakers passing a $13bn aid bill as Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned a Russian attack on a children’s hospital as proof that a “genocide” is being carried out. President Zelenskiy shared footage of a destroyed hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol, saying on Telegram: “The aerial bombing of a children’s hospital is the ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening.” The White House condemned the attack as “barbaric”. The US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, indicated the $13.6bn US aid package was likely to be just the first part of raft of aid measures to be provided to Ukraine, saying that “all of us will have to do more” to help the country. Meanwhile, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, has warned that Russia may be preparing to use chemical or biological weapons. Fighting stopped a humanitarian convoy from from reaching Mariupol, along one of seven corridors to besieged cities set up by Ukraine. Russian troops are reported to have seized parts of Mariupol. How will the $13.6bn be spent? It will be split between military and humanitarian aid: $6.5bn to send troops and weapons to eastern Europe; $6.8bn for refugees and economic aid for allies. When will the bill pass? Senate approval is expected within days. At least one of Donald Trump’s lawyers knew that interrupting the certification of Joe Biden’s election win as part of a plot to return the former president to office would be unlawful, an email exchange has shown. John Eastman, Trump’s former lawyer who helped organise the scheme from the “war room” at the Willard hotel in Washington, admitted in an email to Greg Jacob, counsel for the then vice-president, Mike Pence, that it would be a violation of the Electoral Count Act. However, Eastman encouraged Pence to go ahead with it anyway, saying it was only a “minor violation” of the statute that governed the certification procedure. Who else knew? The email exchange raises the prospect that others in the Willard, including Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani and former strategist Steve Bannon, were also aware of the scheme’s unlawfulness. How significant are the emails? The exchange weakens arguments by Eastman and the rest of the team that they believed there was no wrongdoing in Pence delaying the certification beyond 6 January. Fossil fuel companies are investing in campaigns to appear as defenders of Indigenous interests amid protests against a controversial gas pipeline on First Nation land, an investigation by Eco-Bot.Net and the Guardian has revealed. Ads conveying Indigenous support for the Coastal GasLink pipeline appeared on the Facebook and Instagram feeds of people in British Columbia as Wet’suwet’en Nation members were being evicted from their territory near the pipeline. The ads spiked last November during land defense protests. The investigation found that the fossil fuel groups spent some C$122,000 (US$95,249) on more than 400 targeted Facebook and Instagram ads over the past two years relating to projects around the country. The overwhelming majority were linked to the Coastal GasLink pipeline, a 670km pipeline through unceded Wet’suwet’en territory that has faced opposition from some Indigenous and environmental groups. What is “Indigenous-washing”? The term is used to refer to high-polluting companies misleading the public about their relationship to Indigenous peoples and their land. Did the ads just target British Columbia? Initially, before moving to parts of the country with strong solidarity protests, such as Ontario. Guatemala has increased punishment for abortions, with women who terminate pregnancies facing up to 10 years in prison, up from three. It also explicitly banned same-sex marriage, though it was already in effect illegal. Thousands of demonstrators have gathered in Brazil’s capital to protest against the “ecocide” being waged under the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro. The protest in Brasília was held in opposition to five environment-related bills being considered by Brazil’s congress. A critically endangered species of bat not seen in 40 years has been found in Rwanda. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed the Hill’s horseshoe bat as critically endangered in 2021. Russia has detained 13,789 protesters opposing the country’s invasion of Ukraine since 24 February. While this number may seem large, it should not be read as an indication of vast anti-war movement, as the detention rate is “likely much higher than in normal conditions”, writes Sasha de Vogel. Although many are against the war, some are “barely aware of it” due to draconian media censorship which has made it a crime to use the terms war, attack or invasion. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, there has been a flurry of international coverage focusing on foreign couples using paid Ukrainian surrogate mothers. The articles often make little reference to the surrogates’ wellbeing, and sometimes the couples appear “indifferent to the plight of the women left behind”, writes Sirin Kale in this exploration of the treatment of Ukrainian surrogates during the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe.

3/10/2022,"On 2 March, as the number of Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russia’s brutal invasion reached 1 million, the United Nations security council called an emergency session of the general assembly. There, 193 nations reviewed a resolution on Russia’s “aggression against Ukraine” and voted overwhelmingly to approve it: 141 votes in favor, 35 abstentions and just five votes against. Even some of Russia’s closest allies on the continent – Serbia, for example, or Hungary – voted to condemn the invasion. “The message of the general assembly is loud and clear,” said the UN secretary-general, António Guterres. What exactly is that message? In recent days, many commentators have pointed to a global map of the UN resolution to demonstrate the unity of the west and the world in taking on the Putin government. But to make sense of the geopolitical consequences of the Russian invasion, we must look beyond the diplomatic theater of the general assembly to examine how these nations are actually engaged with the war in this phase of rapid escalation. And to do that, we should start with a very different map of the world – a map of global participation in the sanctions set against Russia by the United States and its allies. The contrast between these maps could not be more striking. The US, the UK, Canada, South Korea, Switzerland, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore, the EU: beyond this fortified coalition, very few nations have chosen to take part in the economic warfare set against the Putin government. On the contrary, many of the world’s largest nations – including China, India, Brazil, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, and even Nato ally Turkey – have refused to join in. “We will not blindly follow the steps taken by another country,” said Indonesia’s foreign ministry representative at a recent press conference. Latin America has been equally steadfast in its commitment to neutrality. “We do not consider that [this war] concerns us,” said the Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. “We are not going to take any sort of economic reprisal because we want to have good relations with all governments.” Argentina may have voted to condemn Russia’s actions at the UN, but its foreign minister, Santiago Cafiero, was adamant about his country’s non-participation in the new sanctions push: “Argentina does not consider that they are a mechanism to generate peace and harmony, or generate a frank dialogue table that serves to save lives.” The Latin American position has been echoed in Africa. “For five centuries, we have been pawns in the hands of the warring European states, bent on looting Africa of its human and natural sources,” says Pierre Sané, president of the Imagine Africa Institute and former secretary-general of Amnesty International. Sané tells me that the embassy in Ukraine has been recruiting “volunteer” mercenaries from countries like Senegal and Ivory Coast to fight in the war. “Should this war in Ukraine escalate, we say and we say it loud: do not bring it to our shores.” Amid the Russian army’s brutal advance into Ukraine, a slew of letters, articles and Twitter commentary has addressed the “western left” for its apparent unwillingness to take on the Putin government. The invasion of Ukraine has been described as a “test” to root out the “pseudo-leftists” who fail to respond with force and conviction to support the west in its effort to isolate, undermine and eventually topple Putin in defense of the Ukrainian cause. But the map of sanctions suggests that the true rift is not between left and right, nor even between east and west. On the contrary, the map reveals a rift between north and south, between the nations that we call developed and those we call developing. And by revealing this tectonic shift, the map can tell us something important about geopolitics in the coming age of multipolarity. The rapid rise of China and the US reaction it has provoked have prompted many commentators to predict a coming cold war. Few expected Vladimir Putin to kick it off so suddenly. “Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has ended Americans’ 30-year holiday from history,” writes the former CIA director Robert Gates for the Washington Post. The immediate eviction of Russian representatives and Russian culture from the institutions of the west suggest the long slumber of the cold war may indeed be over: “Putin’s war has provided the cold shower needed to awaken democratic governments to the reality of a new world.” The good news for Gates is that the Biden administration has already found its cold war footing. Its flagship Summit for Democracy strives to unite “the nations of the free world” – a remarkable homage to the era of anti-Soviet mobilization – while isolating autocracies like Russia and China. That is, with the usual exceptions: Saudi Arabia’s oil, for example, grants the nation a free pass to the “free world”, as made evident by the recent delegation dispatched by the Biden administration to secure the kingdom’s support to keep the oil flowing through the war effort in Ukraine. In the age of unipolarity – in the long 30-year holiday that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union – the nations of the world were given a rather simple choice: side with the United States, or stand alone. Some nations sought to band together in collective acts of resistance to this hegemonic power. But the consequences were all but inevitable: invasions, coups and extensive sanctions to isolate their economies from the world at large. As new powers generate new poles, however, the options available to US neighbor nations are no longer restricted to compliance and resistance. A third option emerges: neutrality. “Neutrality does not mean indifference,” says Pierre Sané. “Neutrality means continuously calling for the respect of international laws; neutrality means that our hearts still go to the victims of military invasions and arbitrary sanctions never imposed on Nato countries.” Back in the first cold war, neutrality had a name: non-alignment. As the United States clashed with China and the Soviet Union in the skies above Korea, Jawaharlal Nehru and Josip Broz Tito refused to take a side. “The people of Yugoslavia cannot accept the postulate that humanity today has only one choice – a choice between a domination of one or the other bloc,” Yugoslavia’s minister of foreign affairs, Edvard Kardelj, told the UN in 1950. “We believe that there exists another road.” The Non-Aligned Movement was born five years later, uniting more than 100 nations around the world around principles of non-interference and peaceful coexistence. Today, nations around the world are called again to take sides – between Russia and the west, and very soon between the west and China. But as the map of sanctions attests, the cross-pressure between these great powers may once again spark a movement for non-alignment, demanding a more universal application of international law against demands for unilateral exception. There will no doubt be consequences for this neutral position. Non-aligned nations in the first cold war were frequently victim to aggression, invasion and economic embargo. The same risks to neutrality are visible today. Lithuania recently canceled a shipment of Covid vaccines to Bangladesh for its refusal to condemn Russia at the United Nations. The US, for its part, has already passed the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa), giving license to punish countries with sanctions for trading with the other side. But as great powers prepare for a new century of war, the call for non-alignment will only grow louder. Our task is to understand that call now as Tito and Nehru understood it then: not as “neutralism” or “passivity, as is sometimes alleged”. As they wrote in a joint declaration in 1954: “It represents the positive, active and constructive policy that, as its goal, has collective peace as the foundation of collective security.” David Adler is a political economist and general coordinator of the Progressive International",Opinion/Opinion,The West v Russia: why the global south isn’t taking sides | David Adler,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/10/russia-ukraine-west-global-south-sanctions-war
3/10/2022,"Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said there had been no progress to achieving a ceasefire in talks in Turkey with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in the first high-level meeting between the two countries since the Moscow-ordered invasion of its neighbour two weeks ago. Talks got under way near Antalya amid an outpouring of international outrage over Russia’s attack on a children’s hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol. The bombing of the 600-bed children’s and maternity hospital that injured pregnant women was evidence of “genocide” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. The White House called the attack barbaric. As western leaders condemned the bombing, Ukraine’s foreign minister and officials were pictured sitting opposite the Russian delegation as the brief talks that Kuleba described as both “easy and difficult” got under way. In comments after the talks broke up, Lavrov said the hospital had been under the control of “Ukrainian radicals” and denied that any patients were present. He said the west had caused the conflict by forcing Ukraine to choose between Russia and the west. Kuleba called for Russia to allow the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol. He said Ukraine was ready for diplomacy but also able to defend itself as it appeared that Russia would fight on and was seeking a surrender from Kyiv. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, who brokered the meeting, said before it began that the aim was to pave the way for talks between Russian president Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy, facilitated by Turkey’s leader, Recep Tayip Erdoğan. Turkey, which is a Nato member and which has not imposed sanctions on Russia but has condemned the attack and allowed Turkish-built drones to be bought by Ukraine, is trying to position itself as a neutral broker in the conflict. The Kremlin has said it would stop the war if Ukraine ceased military action, enshrined in its constitution that it had no plans to join Nato, gave up annexed Crimea and recognised the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. EU leaders, meanwhile, prepared to meet at Versailles to discuss Ukraine’s application to join their ranks. Ahead of the Versailles summit, convened by France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Kuleba stepped up the pressure on the EU to grant Ukraine a fast-track route to membership. Recounting a phone call he had with his French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian, Kuleba tweeted that he had “underscored the historic importance of granting EU membership to Ukraine which now fights for itself and entire Europe”. While Ukraine’s membership bid, swiftly followed by applications from Georgia and Moldova, has been warmly welcomed by central and eastern European countries, older members are wary of moving too quickly, with a country at war that has long struggled with deep-rooted corruption. “This will not happen in the short term, because this is a whole process taking many years,” the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said. France’s Europe minister, Clément Beaune, agreed, saying: “It will take time.” Acknowledging the divisions, a senior EU official said: “Part of the room wants to move swiftly, another part of the room of leaders wants to have some better distance and see, and have a proper discussion at a later stage whether Ukraine should join the union.” Despite pressure from central and eastern European governments, the draft summit communique does not mention the EU’s membership application clause, treaty article 49. Instead, EU leaders will invite the European Commission to submit an opinion on Ukraine’s application – the normal bureaucratic procedure – “pending this and without delay, we will further strengthen our bonds and deepen our partnership”, states a draft summit statement seen by the Guardian, with the recent addition: “Ukraine belongs to our European family.” Separately, the UK announced on Thursday that it was adding seven Russian businessmen to its sanctions list, including the metals billionaire and Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, described by the Foreign Office as “one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin”. The British government is also imposing asset freezes on Putin ally Igor Sechin, the owner of Russian state oil company Rosneft, and Oleg Deripaska, an aluminium magnate believed by the Foreign Office to be worth £2bn. Britain and the US are warning that Russia could be setting the stage to use a chemical weapon in Ukraine after Kremlin officials alleged without firm evidence that the US had been supporting a bioweapons programme in the country. The White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that Russia had been making “false claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine”, adding that the allegations had been echoed in Beijing. “Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” she tweeted. Meanwhile UK intelligence highlighted the strength of the Ukrainian resistance. In an update on Thursday, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said the large Russian column north-west of Kyiv had made “little progress in over a week” and suffers continued losses at the hands of Ukraine forces. The MoD added that there had been a noticeable drop in Russian air activity in recent days, probably due to the “unexpected effectiveness” of Ukraine’s forces. It also said Russia has deployed conscript troops despite assurances from Putin not to do so. As the Russian president seeks to regain momentum, local authorities described the damage to the Mariupol hospital as “colossal” and said women in labour were among the wounded. A local official said the attack injured at least 17 staff, though no deaths were immediately reported. Zelenskiy said the “direct strike by Russian troops” had left children under the wreckage. The deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said Mariupol was being shelled continuously and 1,170 residents had died, 47 of whom were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday. “It’s medieval,” he said. “It’s pure genocide. The attack isn’t simply treacherous. It’s a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.” The Guardian was unable to verify the Ukrainian officials’ accounts, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack. The Red Cross has described conditions in the port city as “apocalyptic”, while the deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said the situation was “catastrophic”.

3/10/2022,"Last December, as Russian forces encircled Ukraine, the Biden administration and its allies delivered a stark warning to Vladimir Putin: “Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited under international law.” In January, as Russian troops massed even in even greater numbers, Secretary of State Antony Blinken added that “the inviolability of frontiers” was among the “guiding principles for international behavior.” Last month, after Russia’s parliament recognized the independence of two self-declared republics Moscow had cleaved from eastern Ukraine, Blinken called this infringement upon “Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity” a “gross violation of international law.” All this is indisputably true. Remaking borders by force violates a core principle of international law. Which is why the Biden administration must do more than resist Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. It must stop violating that principle itself. In 2019, the Trump administration made the United States the only foreign country to recognize Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 War. Tel Aviv University Law Professor Eliav Lieblich noted that the decision – which contradicted a unanimous United Nations Security Council resolution supported by the US itself – constituted a “significant departure from the bedrock legal prohibition of unilateral annexation.” Yale Law School’s Oona Hathaway called the move “outrageous and potentially destabilizing to the postwar international order.” The Russian government called it an “indication of the contempt that Washington shows for the norms of international law.” After Trump’s move, Illinois Senator Richard Durbin asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to explain the legal difference between Israel’s annexation of the Golan and Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, which had led the US to impose sanctions. Pompeo replied that “there’s international law doctrine on this very point. We don’t have time to begin to go through it today. But [I’m] happy to have a team go over and walk you through that.” When journalists followed up, the State Department cited no international law doctrine at all. To the contrary, a department spokeswoman declared, nonsensically, that “The US policy continues to be that no country can change the borders of another by force.” Then, in 2020, the Trump administration followed up by making the United States the only foreign country to recognize Morocco’s annexation of Western Sahara, a territory Morocco invaded in 1975 after the territory’s Spanish colonial rulers withdrew. Former Secretary of State James Baker III called the decision an “astounding retreat from the principles of international law.” Once again, the United States contradicted Security Council resolutions it had supported itself. Once again, Russia blasted the US for transgressing a “universally recognized international legal” principle. Since taking office, the Biden administration has reversed neither of these Trump decisions. To the contrary, the US continues to provide Israel almost $4 billion in military aid per year absent any human rights conditions even as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International allege that it is practicing apartheid. The Biden administration has also boosted arms sales to Morocco even though the US-based democracy watchdog Freedom House reports that people in Western Sahara enjoy fewer freedoms than people in China or Iran. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine gives the Biden administration a chance to reconsider this dangerous path. It can harness the current global revulsion against Putin’s aggression to rebuild the principle that no country should redraw another’s borders by force. But only if it reverses Trump’s decisions and proves that the US is willing to live by the standards it demands of Moscow. Politically, that won’t be easy since Israel, which enjoys strong support in Washington, benefitted from both of Trump’s decisions—his decision on the Golan Heights and his decision on Western Sahara, which helped convince Morocco to normalize diplomatic relations with the Jewish state. But international norms only remain strong if countries abide by them when they’re inconvenient. And if the US chooses continued hypocrisy, it will make Ukraine, Taiwan and every other weaker nation bordered by a rapacious neighbor more vulnerable. After Secretary of State Pompeo defended Trump’s recognition of Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, Senator Durbin warned that, “I don’t think the administration is thinking clearly about how this ends well.” He was right. The continued erosion of the norm against international aggression will not end well. Russia’s attack on Ukraine is just the latest sign. The Biden administration can stem that erosion now. But in addition to the military battle it is assisting in Ukraine, it must wage a political battle at home.

3/10/2022,"By Tuesday afternoon, Lyft driver Elida Zabaleta had earned $100 in the five hours she spent ferrying passengers across the city of San Jose. With gas prices in California surging, she’d have to use more than half of that to cover fuel for the day, leaving her with just $45. The rising cost of gas has made a difficult job all the more difficult, Zabaleta said, forcing her to spend more time behind the wheel to earn enough to afford living in one of the country’s most expensive cities. US gas prices have reached record highs in recent weeks, surging in part by the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after already having been high for months. California drivers are paying the most of any in the country, at an average of $5.57 a gallon, according to AAA. Rising prices are hitting gig workers particularly hard as fuel makes up a large part of their daily costs. Uber and Lyft drivers already struggling after the pandemic hit both wages and working conditions say paying more at the pump means they have to spend more time driving in order to achieve the same level of pay. Some are spending more than 60 hours a week working, and some say driving is simply no longer profitable. Zabaleta, who has driven for Lyft for two years, paid $5.20 a gallon to fill up this week. Meanwhile, factoring in the cost of gas, her income came out to about $9 an hour, far below San Jose’s $16.20 minimum wage. Zabaleta routinely spends as many as 50 hours a week behind the wheel, giving herself just one day off, and is working more to cover the increasing costs. Even before gas prices started rising, pay was becoming increasingly unpredictable driving for Lyft, she said. She previously drove five days a week, but with fewer passengers during the pandemic and fewer bonuses from Lyft, Zabaleta had to add an extra work day to her week in order to maintain the same level of income, she said. Companies such as Lyft aren’t doing enough to help drivers, she said. “This job should be something the worker should enjoy doing – this is a job that’s high risk and we’re putting our lives on the line everyday,” she said. Other drivers said that without increased wages or other support from rideshare companies to help alleviate the burden of fuel costs, driving will no longer be worthwhile. Rondu Gantt started working as a rideshare driver in the San Francisco Bay area in 2018 to supplement his income, but began driving full-time after his teaching job left him burnt out. Since then wages have only dropped, he said, and without the bonuses the companies offer, the job wouldn’t be profitable at all. “We’re at the point where we need the companies to pay bonuses every week just to make the job sustainable,” he said. The normal pay rate is too low, he said, so in addition to driving during the day, he routinely returns to the road at night when surge pricing is in effect. The expensive price of gas has made the job more challenging, Gantt said. “My costs are higher, my pay is the same, so I’m losing money. That’s a mathematical reality,” he said. Benjamin Valdez, who drives part-time for Uber and Lyft in Los Angeles and works as an organizer with Rideshare Drivers United, said he hasn’t driven for two weeks because of the high gas prices. When fuel costs go up, drivers stay out on the road for longer in order to try to make a profit, he said, which means there is more competition for rides. The loss in income is difficult for his family, Valdez said, but with gas prices as high as they are and more drivers out on the road, he’d be losing money driving. “I only drive when it’s profitable, which is few and far between right now,” he said. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has said he will propose a tax rebate to help the state’s drivers grapple with the increasing costs at the pump. Drivers are also hoping to see companies such as Lyft and Uber take steps to help support them amid the high prices, which experts say will likely continue for months. Organizers with Rideshare Drivers United are petitioning the rideshare companies to raise compensation and “set the rates fairly and equitably because of our increased costs”, said Daniel Russell, a part-time Uber driver and organizer with RDU. When asked if Lyft would offer additional support to drivers as fuel costs increase, Lyft spokesperson CJ Macklin said it had taken concrete steps to help, including a fuel cash-back program run in partnership with GetUpside. Macklin also said that US drivers are now seeing greater average hourly pay than they were a year ago, even with high fuel prices, as more riders return to the platform. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Vitalii Konstantinov, who drives for Uber in San Diego and works with Rideshare Drivers United, said rising costs have forced him to dip into his family’s budget, and cancel a trip to Disneyland he had planned for his young children. He’s actively looking for other jobs. “It’s not worth driving for Uber anymore,” he said. Gantt said he’s also considering leaving the industry. “It is unsustainable for me to feel comfortable in this industry right now. I feel the vulnerability. I see how reliant I am on them to give me a bonus, I see how low the rate is,” he said. “I can’t work 16 hours every day. I’m gonna burn out. It’s physically demanding to be tired, drinking coffee, under-rested, and driving morning and night.”",News/US news,‘It’s not worth it’: rising gas prices force drivers to work for less than minimum wage,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/10/gig-workers-gas-prices-california-uber-lyft

3/10/2022,"Higher levels of exposure to toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” may increase the likelihood of Covid-19 infection, more serious symptoms and death, a group of recent studies have found. Public health advocates and researchers have feared since the coronavirus pandemic’s onset that PFAS, which are known to be immunotoxic, could hinder the body’s ability to fight Covid-19, and the four studies represent the first bit of research supporting the theory. However, the authors caution that more research is needed. “There’s clear science and evidence that immunological response and PFAS are connected and associated – that’s why the Covid aspect is so important to pursue,” said Christel Nielsen, one of the study’s co-authors. PFAS, or per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 9,000 compounds most often used to make products water-, stain- and heat-resistant, and are called “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally break down. They’re so effective that they’re used in thousands of applications across dozens of industries, but they’re also linked to cancer, decreased immunity, liver disease, kidney problems, birth defects and more. PFAS are estimated to be in about 97% of Americans’ blood, and have been detected in all corners of the globe, including the Arctic. Some compounds can remain in the body for years or decades, depending on the quantity and chemical structure. Pre-pandemic studies have strongly suggested that the chemicals reduce vaccine efficacy in children, and several studies of how high PFAS levels impact the Covid vaccines are under way. The chemicals are probably immunotoxic because they interfere with the body’s ability to create cells that turn into plasma. Plasma generates the antibodies that fight infection, and PFAS compounds appear to impact “key molecules” in that process, said Phillipe Grandjean, an environmental health professor at Harvard. A study he co-authored found one widely-used compound, PFBA, seemed to be particularly problematic. PFAS that are commonly used to repel water and grease in food packaging, or used as stain and waterproofing agents in clothing, shoes and carpeting can turn into PFBA when they break down. The study’s authors checked plasma samples from 323 Danish residents who had Covid and looked for five PFAS compounds known to be immunotoxic. The study found detectable PFBA in plasma showed “a clear association with a more severe” symptoms and death. “If you had PFBA in your blood, then you were more likely to go to the hospital, and to stay longer, to get into intensive care and to die from the infection,” said Grandjean. More than 20 of those people who had PFBA in their blood had died. “The likelihood of this happening accidentally is extremely small,” Grandjean said. Industry has said “short-chain” compounds like PFBA are safe because they don’t stay in the blood for as long as many other PFAS, but the study casts doubt on that claim. While many PFAS accumulate in the blood, PFBA accumulates in the lungs, and appears to exacerbate symptoms because of that trait. It did so even when it was found at lower levels than other compounds. “The unique retention of PFBA in lung tissue may offer a clue to” why PFBA seems to cause more serious disease, the study stated. PFAS exposure has also been linked to obesity and diabetes, the authors noted, which can intensify Covid symptoms. The chemicals have endocrine-disrupting properties that seem to mimic, block, or otherwise interfere with hormones that affect immunity. Two studies looked at whether exposure to high levels of PFAS increased the risk of infection. Researchers in Sweden checked infection rates from the pandemic’s first year in Ronneby, a town of about 30,000 where one-third of the population was for decades exposed to highly contaminated drinking water, and the entire population has elevated blood levels. The infection rate was about 19% higher than in a nearby town with water that didn’t have elevated PFAS levels. The study also found that people with lower PFAS blood levels were more likely to be infected, though contamination is so great in Ronneby that lower levels there are still higher than the general population. The authors characterized their analysis as a “fast and easy” way to look for a public health correlation and determine whether more investigation is needed: “This is something that clearly warrants further research,” said Nielsen, a study co-author, who added that they are undertaking a second more in-depth study and looking into the chemicals’ impact on vaccine efficacy. Chinese researchers with similar aim checked urine and blood samples from 160 residents in the Shanxi and Shandong provinces, two regions heavily polluted by PFAS. The study compared samples from 80 people who had either tested positive for Covid and 80 who had never been infected, and found “significantly higher risks of [Covid] infection in the subjects with increased urinary PFOS, PFOA,” two of the most toxic and widely used compounds. An ecological study in Italy looked into morbidity rates among those exposed to high levels of the chemicals for 65 years in the Veneto region. An examination of a population of 200,000 found those exposed to high levels of PFAS had a 27% higher Covid mortality rate. The population was exposed to a mix of at least 12 compounds, which included PFBA. The data “might plausibly suggest a general immunosuppressive effect of PFAS, it might be a quite specific effect of PFBA concentrating in the lungs and exacerbating Covid respiratory toxicity, or PFAS might lead to other conditions that predispose people with coronavirus infection to more severe disease”, the study’s authors wrote. Co-author Annibale Bieggeri called the issue “an injustice”, adding that PFAS can also increase the likelihood of a variant because the virus will stay in bodies for longer. He said the studies findings should prompt public health officials to make special considerations for areas highly affected by PFAS. Researchers say there’s little that someone who has been exposed to high levels of the chemicals, or has high levels in their blood, can do beyond the usual precautions. “The most important recommendation that we can give is to get vaccinated, pure and simple, for everyone, and perhaps particularly in a highly exposed area,” said Swedish study co-author Anna Joud.",News/Environment,"Higher levels of PFAS exposure may increase chance of Covid, studies say",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/pfas-covid-infection-forever-chemicals-studies
3/10/2022,"On 24 October 2019, Maura Healey, the attorney general of Massachusetts, sued ExxonMobil for “deceptive advertising” and for “misleading Massachusetts investors about the risks to Exxon’s business posed by fossil fuel-driven climate change”. It was the culmination of an investigation Healey had launched in 2016 looking into how Exxon allegedly misled the public about climate, decades after its own scientists had briefed the company on the realities of the issue. This week, the Massachusetts supreme court is hearing arguments related to that case – but not about Exxon’s actions decades earlier. Instead, the oil company wants the courts to decide whether Healey violated its first amendment rights by bringing the suit in the first place. With all of its other legal options exhausted, Exxon’s efforts to stop this case hinge on the one last complaint: invoking Massachusetts’ anti-Slapp statute. Slapp stands for Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation, and statutes against such legal claims originated out of efforts to protect the press and civil society groups from corporations that wanted to silence critics. In recent years, however, it’s become increasingly common for corporations to invoke anti-Slapp laws instead to protect their first amendment rights. The anti-Slapp argument has become a go-to strategy in US climate litigation. In some two dozen climate liability cases, in which counties, cities and states are asking oil companies to pay their share of climate adaptation costs, the oil company defendants have argued that their public statements about climate change were not “deceptive” so much as persuasive. They describe their ads, op-eds and public appearances discouraging climate action as “petitioning” statements, turning them into political speech that is protected by the first amendment. Never before published internal documents from Mobil Oil reveal that company executives created the framework of corporate free speech back in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The argument arose out of a situation not unlike the one playing out today, with war driving up prices at the pump and oil companies wanting desperately to change the public’s perception of their industry. The longtime Mobil VP of public affairs, Herbert Schmertz, and then CEO, Rawleigh Warner, came up with an idea to help them wrestle back control of the narrative and win over the public: using Mobil’s PR and advertising budget, they would create “idea advertising”, also known as “issue” or “advocacy” advertising, to push the company’s take on key issues of the day and to create the sense of Mobil as a citizen, with a distinct personality. In a 1971 strategy document explaining the reasons for this approach, Schmertz wrote: “We expect consumers increasingly to factor their notions of a company’s social responsiveness into their decisions about buying its products and stock.” In an interview about the strategy a few years later Schmertz explained, “Legislation does not develop in a vacuum. It grows out of public attitudes and mirrors public beliefs. When it comes to matters of energy, the oil industry tends to be viewed as the villain.” By 1970, Mobil began running weekly advertorials in the New York Times presenting the company’s point of view and, as Schmertz put it, “trying to explain the energy industry to the American people”. But the ads weren’t just policy stances – Mobil also used the space to develop what Schmertz called its “corporate persona”, where the company openly supported everything from public transit to the arts and educational programs. At the same time, Mobil began funding programming on PBS, starting with the extremely popular Masterpiece Theater. Within just a couple of years, the company was running polls that showed consumers were starting to think of Mobil as the “thinking man’s oil company”. The company had less success, however, in convincing network TV stations. CBS and ABC refused to run visual versions of Mobil’s advertorials, saying they preferred to let their journalists cover issues of importance to the public. That response prompted Schmertz and Warner to go on a years-long campaign pushing the idea of corporate free speech and the need to protect it. In letters to TV executives and to newspaper editors, and speeches to various pro-business clubs, all obtained by the Guardian, the two oil executives make the argument repeatedly that protecting corporate free speech is tantamount to protecting democracy. Warner blamed environmentalists for the industry’s woes, and their need to speak out, in speeches to the Economic Clubs of Chicago and Detroit too. “We contend that the inherent limitations of broadcast news, especially time constraints, lack of expertise in energy, and programming formats, act against accurate and in-depth coverage of energy, and other complex, major issues,” Schmertz wrote to the CBS president, Arthur Taylor, in 1974. “The obligations of network news to the public go beyond fairness and objectivity. They should promote a free flow of information and opinion on major issues to the public.” The same year, in a talk at the annual convention of the Edison Electric Institute, which would go on to be a major purveyor of climate denial in the 1980s, Warner warned: “We are in no sense eager to stifle those who oppose us. On the contrary. We just want to be heard, too.” Robert Kerr, media law professor at the University of Oklahoma’s Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication, has researched corporate free speech and Mobil’s role in crafting the idea for decades. “This whole argument that the corporate voice was being silenced is just the opposite of the truth,” he said. Kerr adds that by virtue of having more time, people and funding than any individual and most groups, corporations “could always get their views out better than the average person by manyfold”. Nonetheless, Schmertz and Warner sensed a threat in the 1970s. While Mobil never filed a case of its own to defend its “free speech” rights, it did begin filing amicus briefs in other corporate speech cases, and encouraging other pro-business advocates, like the US Chamber of Commerce, to do the same. The company also continued to regularly make the case in the court of public opinion via its weekly advertorials in the New York Times and its executives’ regular appearances on radio and TV. The work Mobil did to rile the business community up about corporate free speech in the 1970s culminated in the first big supreme court case on the matter, the precursor to Citizens United, First National Bank v Bellotti. The case became a precursor to the controversial Citizens United ruling in 2010, which opened the floodgates on corporate spending. In 1978, the court ruled that corporations could spend whatever money they wanted to in an effort to influence politics, overruling a Massachusetts statute that said otherwise. In the ruling, Justice Lewis A Powell said, “If the restricted view of corporate speech taken by the Massachusetts court were accepted, government would have the power to deprive society of the views of corporations.” Citizens United blurred the line between commercial speech – a marketing message from a company to the public – and political speech, which up until Citizens United was connected only to funding or speech backing a particular candidate or policy. Oil companies have been trying to obliterate that line for years, and their arguments in the current batch of climate cases are the latest effort. In Massachusetts this week, attorney Justin Anderson, a partner with Paul, Weiss, ExxonMobil’s law firm, argued that the state attorney general’s fraud complaint against Exxon was not valid because the company’s public statements on climate policy should be considered as political opinion, not misleading advertising – even when Exxon falsely claimed that climate change isn’t real. When asked why they would opt to file an anti-Slapp complaint rather than make a direct first amendment argument in court, Anderson made it clear that the point is to avoid discovery – the period of time in a civil case when corporations are asked to hand over files and make their executives available for depositions. “The anti-Slapp statute provides a mechanism to have a case that is brought against someone for petitioning activity dismissed at the outset before burdensome discovery is imposed on the party,” he argued. Legal observers believe that the oil companies’ response to the climate cases tees up the likelihood of the next big supreme court case on corporate first amendment rights. “They will try to defend their misinformation efforts as political speech covered by the first amendment and not subject to false advertising laws,” says Robert Brulle, an environmental sociologist who has co-authored briefs in some of these cases. Kerr agrees, although he notes that to side with the oil companies’ arguments in these cases, the supreme court would have to turn its back on about a century’s worth of legal precedent. “It’s really deeply established even by some of the members of the current supreme court, that the first amendment will never protect expression that is fraud,” he said. “The worry now is that with this court there seems to be a majority that wants to say yes to almost any question the corporate interests raise. And I hope I’m wrong about that. I hope this is a line they won’t cross.”",News/Environment,How oil companies rebranded deceptive climate ads as ‘free speech’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/oil-companies-corporate-free-speech-laws-climate-litigation

3/10/2022,"TikTok has blocked all non-Russian content in Russia but is allowing historical content uploaded by domestic accounts to stay online, including videos by state-backed media services. The Chinese-owned video sharing app said on Sunday it had banned livestreaming and uploading of new content in Russia after the Kremlin criminalised the spreading of what it deems to be fake news about its invasion of Ukraine. TikTok’s measures have extended to blocking all non-Russian content, meaning the only content Russian users can see is old videos uploaded by Russia-based accounts. Russian access to internet content from inside and outside Russia has been severely reduced by the Ukraine invasion. Facebook and Twitter have had their services blocked by the Russian communications regulator after the platforms pulled content from state-media backed news providers across Europe. Twitter has launched a privacy-protected version of its site to bypass surveillance and censorship. Tracking.exposed, an EU-based non-profit organisation that studies the profiling and tracking of internet users, described TikTok’s move as establishing a “splinternet” within a global social media platform. It said: “This is the first time that a global social media platform splits the content availability at such scale.” According to tracking.exposed, which used Russian IP addresses to attempt to access non-Russian TikTok content, the accounts of the World Health Organization and the popular TikToker Charli D’Amelio – who has 137.6 million followers – are among those inaccessible in Russia. On Sunday, TikTok said it did not want to put its Russian employees or users at risk of severe criminal penalties, as it described the service as a source of “relief and human connection during a time of war”. TikTok is the 10th most popular app in Russia.

Mordashov had invested in Tui and joined its supervisory board but he was forced to resign last week after the sanctions were revealed. Tui had sold its stake in the joint venture at the end of March 2021 to KN-Holdings LLC, a company then wholly owned and controlled by Mordashov’s sons, Kirill and Nikita. However, Mordashov recently took back control of the company. The brand licence agreement allowed Tui Russia to continue using the name in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. It is thought that the Russian business is planning to announce a new brand name as soon as Thursday. Fritz Joussen, the chief executive of Tui Group, said: “Tui condemns Russia’s attack and war against Ukraine. Our position is clear. The Tui brand must no longer be used by Tui Russia for its business and the company’s presence.” Tui’s links with Mordashov have come under close scrutiny since the invasion of Ukraine, and Italian authorities last week reportedly seized a 65m yacht said to belong to him. Mordashov controls about a third of Tui’s shares via different investment vehicles. Mordashov’s shares in Tui have been frozen, meaning he cannot sell them to realise any profits. He also resigned from Tui’s board as soon as the sanctions were announced. Mordashov, one of Russia’s richest men, owns Severgroup, which includes the vast Severstal steel producer and a Tui stake. The EU’s announcement of sanctions on Mordashov said he was, through Severgroup’s banking, media and industrial interests, “responsible for supporting actions and policies that undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine”. In a statement on Monday, Mordashov said he had “absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension” and did not understand why the EU had imposed sanctions on him. Vladimir Lukin, another Russian with links to Severgroup, also resigned from Tui’s board this week.",News/Business,Tui Group terminates branding deal with Tui Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/10/tui-group-terminates-branding-deal-russia-alexei-mordashov-eu-sanctions
3/10/2022,"Global warming is changing European birds as we know them, a study has found, but it’s not just the increase in temperature that’s to blame. Researchers have found that garden warblers, for example, are having a quarter fewer chicks, which has huge implications for the species. Chiffchaffs are laying their eggs 12 days earlier. Members of the passerine family are getting smaller, while redstarts are getting larger. Researchers pored over data collected since the mid-90s in Britain and the Netherlands on 60 different species, including the house sparrow, the crested tit, the reed bunting, the bullfinch and the willow warbler. They zero in on how these birds have changed over time with regard to their egg-laying schedules, number of offspring and morphology. Although research has already linked the way passerines – the swallow family – are getting smaller over time to hotter temperatures, scientists weren’t sure whether this was due to heat stress directly or because rising temperatures make it harder to forage. The scientists investigated what proportion of changes over time were linked to warming, and whether warming affected some species or traits more than others, as well as whether other factors unrelated to temperature reinforced these effects. The study, which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal last week, found that although more than half of trait changes are linked with rising temperatures – and warming is likely the largest factor driving change over the years – other factors such as urbanisation, pollution, habitat loss and more could also affect shifts in characteristics. “For example, climate change caused chiffchaffs to lay their eggs six days earlier over the last 50 years, but other unknown environmental factors led to an additional six days, meaning in total they now lay their eggs 12 days earlier than they did half a century ago”, said Martijn van de Pol, lead author of the paper from James Cook University in Australia. A change in schedule this big can cause a mismatch between when chicks are born and when food is available for them, breaking the ecosystem balance. On average, up to 57% of overall change over the past decades can be linked to temperature warming, according to the study. Approximately 32% of 60 bird species had changes in body conditions due to temperatures, with an average decrease in size of 0.45% for every celsius increase in heat. About 86% had changes in egg-laying times, and 31% had changes in their number of offspring. “Garden warblers in the UK have experienced a 26% decrease in their average number of offspring over the past half century, which is really concerning for the long-term fate of this species,” said Nina McLean, the lead researcher on the study, from the ANU Research School of Biology. “But only half of this reduction, 13%, can be attributed to climate change.” Not all species are being affected the same way. Some, like the redstart, are clearly increasing their body condition and offspring number. The researchers speculate the variation of how much different species’ traits are changing is most probably up to non-temperature factors. “The study gives a well-grounded explanation for why different species change at such different rates. And it is not to do with temperature sensitivity, but with those other, non-temperature factors,” said Shahar Dubiner, an ecologist at Tel Aviv University, who was not involved in the study. Dubiner’s research has, similarly, found dramatic changes in shape and body condition for over half of Israeli bird species – including many who migrate from Europe, such as storks. Overall, this means warming is likely the largest factor driving trait change, but it’s not the only element at play. Other adjacent factors may play a more prominent role than previously thought – the question is what these other non-temperature factors are, and how they are linked to temperature increase.",News/Environment,"Climate change fundamentally affecting European birds, study shows ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/climate-change-fundamentally-affecting-european-birds-study-shows
3/10/2022,"A red carpet, applause and dozens of blue and white flags were waiting for the first Jewish Ukrainian refugees to arrive in Israel as part of a huge rescue operation triggered by Moscow’s invasion. About 400 people on four flights from Poland, Moldova and Romania landed in Tel Aviv on Sunday, among them 100 children who had been living in a Jewish orphanage in the northern city of Zhytomyr. Most of the new arrivals were visibly relieved to have reached safety; as is tradition, several people touched and kissed the ground after disembarking. Many of the new arrivals had never been to Israel before, and did not imagine they would be making aliyah – the immigration of Jews from the diaspora to the Holy Land – under these circumstances. But as so often in the two weeks since Russia announced the military operation against its neighbour, history appears to be repeating itself. “Israel is not what I expected … Well, I did not really know what to expect,” said 17-year-old computer programmer Yohor Sereda, who fled Kyiv with his father and grandfather. After a dangerous journey to the Polish border, for two days the trio took turns to stand in line and nap in the car before they were allowed to cross. In Warsaw, they were reunited with Sereda’s mother and two younger sisters, who had been on holiday in Egypt when the war broke out. “I just took my laptop and a rucksack of clothes. It was very scary driving out of Kyiv: there were explosions everywhere. It felt like being in a movie,” he said. “But we are definitely the luckier ones.” About 1 million Ukrainian Jews were killed in the Holocaust, but Ukraine and Russia are still home to large Jewish communities. Israeli interior minister Ayelet Shaked said on Tuesday that the state is preparing to take in up to 100,000 Jews from the two countries and other former soviet republics after the onset of Europe’s new war as part of Operation Israel Guarantees. Up to 5,000 non-Jewish Ukrainians will be allowed to come to Israel and another 20,000 who arrived before the fighting will be able to stay temporarily. A heavily criticised policy of forcing Ukrainian nationals or their Israeli hosts to pay a 10,000 shekel (£2,330) bond on arrival at Ben Gurion airport has now been scrapped. The country’s law of return – much reviled by Palestinians, to whom it does not apply – gives people born Jewish, converts, spouses of Jewish people and those with Jewish parents or grandparents the right to move to Israel and acquire Israeli citizenship. Since 1950, Israel has seen several waves of aliyah immigration from countries such as Sudan, Ethiopia and Yemen. Operation Israel Guarantees, however, is an emergency undertaking on a scale not seen since the influx of more than 1 million people after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989. At a four-star hotel next to West Jerusalem’s main bus station on Wednesday, the lobby and restaurant were chaotic: suitcases and bags of clothes were left next to sofas while Ukrainian olim, or migrants, spoke into their mobiles in Ukrainian and Russian to loved ones and lawyers sorting out their paperwork. Small children ran around playing while teenagers made TikTok videos. Immigration ministry employees and volunteer interpreters were on hand to help. But for Igor Fedyaev, from the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia near the contested regions of Donbas and Crimea, the enormity of what has happened has not yet sunk in. While the state will help, he doesn’t yet know where his family will live, or learn Hebrew. Fedyaev was not following the news before 24 February, when the invasion began. As usual, he got up early for his weekly five-a-side football game before work, only to realise that something was wrong: the roads were empty, and the gym was closed. “No one really believed it would happen. It was only the next day we realised we needed to look at escaping,” the 43-year-old father of two said. Fedyaev thought about making aliyah in 2019 after visiting a friend in the Israeli city of Netanya, but forgot about it during the pandemic. The family realised they would need permission from Fedyaev’s first wife in order to take his 16-year-old son, Maksim. While she was keen to help, no lawyers were available to assist with notarising the paperwork, and government databases had shut down. In the end, they had to leave with just a written note from Maksim’s mother before embarking on a 680-mile car journey, making lengthy detours to avoid bombed out towns and roads. “The images we are seeing, it looks like the second world war,” he said. “In the end in every war you see the same sort of things. Most people love their home and the country they were born in. Just because [you are Jewish] it doesn’t mean you want to leave.”",News/Global development,‘No one really believed it would happen’: first Jewish Ukrainian refugees arrive in Israel,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/10/first-jewish-ukrainian-refugees-arrive-in-israel
3/10/2022,"British troops will be sent to help speed up the processing of visas for Ukrainian refugees in Poland but not France, the UK’s armed forces minister has said, amid criticism that people are having to wait too long for help. James Heappey said the Home Office was “reconsidering” current plans for vetting the more than 20,000 people who had fled Ukraine and were hoping to join family members in the UK. After Labour accused the government of failing to learn the lessons of Afghanistan and Tory MPs raised concerns about the UK lagging behind other European countries in its support for refugees, Heappey said some bureaucracy could be stripped away. He said the Home Office believed it could reinforce the visa application centre in northern France without help from the Ministry of Defence (MoD). But Heappey said the MoD had been asked to “supply manpower to Poland, which is the busiest of the visa application centres by some margin” and that the department was “in the process of making that happen”. It came as the PCS union, which represents civil servants including Home Office staff, has called for the government to take urgent action to help Ukrainian refugees after being told the “surge team” boasted about by Priti Patel amounted to just seven people. The union understands the seven volunteers, who have been trained in personal safety, will assist with visa applications in Paris, Warsaw, Rzeszów, Chișinău, Bucharest, Budapest and Prague. On Sunday, visiting the Ukrainian Social Club in Holland Park, London, Patel said everything was being done to process as many applications as possible. “I’m surging staff across all application centres across the entire European Union as well as in the border countries such as Poland, where I was the other day and obviously where huge numbers of people are coming through,” she said. A Home Office spokesperson said the allegation from the union that there were only seven people in the surge team was “wrong”. Heappey told Sky News: “We’ll supply as many people as they need in order to be able to get the highest number of people processed in the quickest time possible and then the home secretary has got some choices, which I know she’s considering, around how to further change the visa process and what checks might be necessary within it.” Heappey said Patel would consider how to change the process and then “weigh that up against risk”. “A lot of people have made the point this is very different to Afghanistan, this is predominantly a refugee flow of women and children because fighting-age men have remained in Ukraine to fight,” he told BBC Breakfast. “I know the home secretary is very aware of that but she needs to make decisions around how to change visa policy and, crucially, the security checks that are done within visa policy in a way that still gives her the assurance that she needs that at a time of acute competition in Europe between the west and Russia we’re not making the mistake of dropping our guard altogether.” He added: “I know she’ll make the right decision.” A warning that Russian forces were considering a chemical weapons attack was made public on Wednesday night in an effort to deter the Kremlin from following through with it, Heappey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. He said that while recent reports of civilians being killed were tragic, “they are but nothing by comparison to the suffering and devastation” that would be caused by a chemical weapons attack. Heappey called it “the most despicable thing that everyone could imagine” and said he was “appalled it is even under consideration”. After a hospital complex in Mariupol was bombed, Heappey said it was “utterly despicable” that Russia had either used its weapons indiscriminately against civilians or deliberately targeted the building. “It is a war crime to not have due regard when you’re targeting for a protected site – like a hospital – when you’re using artillery,” he said.",News/World news,UK troops to help process refugees in Poland – but not France,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/uk-troops-to-help-process-refugees-in-poland-but-not-france
3/10/2022,"Over the last fortnight, Russians have risked fines, prison terms of up to 15 years, physical abuse and more to express the belief that their country’s invasion of Ukraine is not in their name. At time of writing, 13,789 protesters have been detained since 24 February. An observer scrolling Twitter or watching the detainee count ratchet up might think that the anti-war movement could threaten Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine. But the reality on the ground looks different: the anti-war movement is small, weak and faces serious obstacles. While the number of detentions is striking, it should not be confused with high turnout, because the detention rate is likely much higher than in normal conditions. Photos suggest that in many cities, the number of people at demonstrations is a few dozen or few hundred at most, with turnouts in Moscow and St Petersburg probably in the thousands. When it comes to protest, size matters. A larger protest is generally safer to attend, as the individual risk of repression usually drops as the turnout climbs. But size is also essential to achieve visibility, which communicates a message to the public. Protests could play an important role in communicating opposition and even information about the war to the Russian public. But given the extraordinary increase in media censorship, the sudden eradication of independent media, the throttling of key social networking sites, and extensive use of propaganda, these protests are more visible to audiences in the west than to the Russian public at large. The protests are also far too small to disrupt the status quo – another key measure of a protest’s effectiveness. An oft-cited statistic from Erica Chenoweth and Maria J Stephan suggests that non-violent movements are most likely to be successful when 3.5% of the population joins the protests. For Russia, that number is around 5 million people. Even if turnout in Moscow reaches the hundreds of thousands, there is little reason to believe that Putin, an isolated autocrat whose legacy now hangs on this war, will submit to their demands. Why aren’t these protests larger? Although many Russians are against the war, others are barely aware of it. Most Russians receive their news from state media, which is under strict instruction to refer to Russia’s actions in Ukraine as a “special military operation”; using the terms war, attack or invasion is now a crime. Though it is difficult to estimate what share of Russians believe the state line, misinformation and propaganda are incredibly widespread. The political opposition has been decimated in the last few years and is unable to coordinate an anti-war effort. Following the January 2021 protests in support of Alexey Navalny, his organisations were declared extremist and functionally eliminated. Other opposition political parties with national reach, such as Yabloko, are exceedingly unlikely to chance severe penalties for organising illegal protests, or expose their followers to repression. For individual activists, the landscape is also bleak. Many oppositionists are in self-imposed exile, and lack both the social media reach and the moral authority to call for protest. Those in Russia are rapidly repressed, such as human rights activist Marina Litvinovich, who was arrested on the day of the invasion, a few hours after she posted about protesting. The repressive landscape is changing rapidly, with new consequences for speaking out introduced seemingly on a daily basis, and many potential protesters have already begun leaving the country. As a result, there is no “anti-war movement” as such in Russia. The protests happening across the country have no coordinating body. Many have been planned through personal networks and social media posts. In some cases, opponents of the war have simply travelled to their nearest city centre in the hope of finding like-minded citizens. Many protests are single-person pickets. Although the Russian anti-war movement is not currently looking likely to change the course of the war, that does not mean it will have no effect. Repression often leads to innovation in protest and new leaders and organisers may emerge. For instance, soldiers’ mothers, a group with a long history of political activism in Russia, may organise against the mistreatment of troops. As the consequences of sanctions are felt across society, more Russians may oppose the war. Demonstrations against specific economic grievances such as wage arrears, inflation and declining pensions have been common under Putin. Yet Russians also exhibit a tendency to put their heads down when the economy sours, as they did during the economic downturn that followed the 2014 seizure of Crimea. Even if anti-war protests remain small, they prove to the world that Putin does not represent the will of all Russians.

3/10/2022,"Since Russian tanks began rolling over the Ukrainian border, the international media have reported on the plight of foreign couples using paid Ukrainian surrogate mothers. Usually, these articles make scant reference to the surrogates’ wellbeing, instead being written up as breathless tales of derring-do, as plucky couples launch daring raids to bring their babies to safety. The Irish Independent, for example, reported on a County Kerry couple who had brought their son back from Ukraine without making any reference to their surrogate, presumably left postpartum in a war zone. Sometimes, the couples appear indifferent to the plight of the women left behind: one American parent recently wrote a 1,257-word Instagram post about getting her newborn out of Ukraine in which she thanked her gym for keeping her “fit enough” to make the journey and the travel agent who had arranged her hotel, but did not make any reference to the woman who had carried her baby. Olga Danchenko, a surrogacy lawyer from Kyiv who fled to western Ukraine with her family on the first day of the invasion, has been inundated with emails and phone calls. In their worry for their babies, many of her clients forget her own predicament. “The parents who are facing problems getting their babies don’t care about us,” she says. “They say: ‘Hi, Olga, give me the documents.’ ‘Hi, Olga, please draft this.’ ‘Hi, Olga, I need a birth certificate, I need my baby, I signed a contract with you.’ Not a single question about how I am doing.” She sounds exhausted. “We have nightmares during the day and during our dreams at night,” Danchenko says. “Can you imagine? Everything is broken in one day.” Not everyone is focused solely on the babies. “I want to look after our surrogate,” says Annabel (not her real name), a teacher in her 40s from Suffolk. “Not just because she is carrying our baby – but because she is a human being I have formed a connection with.” Annabel and her husband have been trying for a baby for a decade. In that time, they have endured four miscarriages and the death of a prematurely born daughter. Annabel researched surrogacy carefully and picked an agency she felt was ethical. “We didn’t go into this to abuse or take advantage of anyone,” says Annabel. “We entered into an agreement with a person to change our lives – and financially we can change hers.” She considers her surrogate, a 33-year-old mother-of-one who is 12 weeks pregnant, a friend. “We made a connection straight away,” Annabel says. “It’s hard to explain what that feels like, when you meet someone who will change your life.” Even before the war, Yana Belozor, who is 32 and lives in Kyiv, had seen how badly some surrogates are treated. A former surrogate herself, she says the agency she used to work for gave her no emotional support and that she had to chase her salary (most surrogates are paid a lump sum and then a monthly stipend). When she gave birth in 2019, she says the agency sent her to the worst hospital in Kyiv. “I still have nightmares about it,” she shudders. “I was treated like an animal. All the surrogates were placed away from the women having their own biological children and treated differently.” Commercial surrogacy is outlawed in most of the world, although it is legal in some jurisdictions including certain US states. The Ukrainian ombudsman for children has said he believes it should also be banned in Ukraine, where an estimated 2,000 to 2,500 children are born via surrogacy each year. The human rights group La Strada receives 100 calls a year from distressed Ukrainian surrogates. “They send us their contracts so we can assess how legal they are,” says Yuliia Anosova, a lawyer for the organisation who is currently a refugee in Poland. “They’re a total disaster. Often, they’re not even legal.” She recalls one contract in which a woman was forced to relocate mid-pregnancy and told her salary would be docked if she refused. But advocates for Ukrainian surrogacy argue that the overwhelming majority of agencies behave ethically. Before the war, says Danchenko, the system was “amazing” and acted in the “best interests of children and parents”. Belozor became a surrogacy coordinator for another agency, Delivering Dreams, to make sure other women had a better experience than she had. “This is my calling,” she says. Before the war, she was responsible for the wellbeing of 14 pregnant surrogates, mostly in Kyiv. By law, clients – or intended parents, as they are known – must be married, heterosexual and medically unable to have children. These couples, and their surrogates, are caught up in the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe. “Things have got insanely hard,” says Sam Everingham, an Australian fertility lawyer. He has a roster of 70 clients with Ukrainian surrogates at various stages of pregnancy. Natalie Gamble, a British fertility lawyer, is helping 23 British couples, with surrogates ranging from eight to 39 weeks pregnant, get across the border. “In every case, parents are worried about whether surrogates will be able to access medical care and give birth safely, and what will happen if the couples can’t get there when they do,” she says. “Will the babies be left in a war zone with no one to look after them?” Compounding the chaos is the fact that few agencies expected Russia to invade, meaning that they did not make contingency plans. “The situation in Ukraine is stable,” one agency reassured clients on Facebook in late January. “There is no increased or unusual military activity.” Belozor’s American boss, Susan Kersch-Kibler, felt differently. In the second week of February, Kersch-Kibler persuaded 13 of her 14 surrogates, and Belozor, to move to Lviv in western Ukraine. None wanted to go. “They were arguing with me,” Kersch-Kibler says. “It was hard. In the end, I had to sell it like a paid holiday.” Kersch-Kibler offered to move the surrogates’ families with them, but only two of the surrogates, and Belozor, brought their children. They thought they would be going home soon and didn’t want to uproot their families. For now, these surrogates, at least, are safe. But, under Ukrainian martial law, male citizens aged between 18 and 60 are not permitted to leave the country. Surrogates may soon face a terrible dilemma: evacuate and leave their partners and even children behind, or remain in a country under attack. To compound their worry, their family and friends back home are not safe. Belozor’s husband is a firefighter in Kyiv. “For 11 days, he hasn’t been able to change his clothes or take a shower,” she says. “All day long, he is inhaling smoke.” Despite her worries, Belozor keeps working. “My biggest job is to keep the women all emotionally stable,” she says. If they start to feel anxious, she takes them to a doctor, to confirm the baby is OK. The day before we speak, Belozor’s best friend from childhood, Alexi Semenyk, was shot in the head by Russian forces near Luhansk. He was 35. Like many Ukrainians, Belozor is desperate for western countries to implement a no-fly zone over the country. “The world needs to help,” she says, sobbing. “There won’t be any peace in this world, because Putin is so sick and unpredictable and dangerous.” Annabel’s surrogate and her son are now safe in Poland. The journey took three days. “She told us when she got on the train, but then her battery died,” says Annabel. “I was literally sick with fear for her and her son. You’re watching the news to see if there have been any attacks on trains, or at the border. When I got her message to say she’d crossed the border, I cried.” Annabel hopes that her surrogate will be able to join her in the UK – if that is what she wants. “We want her here so we can look after her,” Annabel says. “And not just until the baby is born. We want to look after her until she can go home, or wherever she chooses for home to be. If she chooses to stay here, then we will help establish her here.” Annabel and her husband will drive to Poland to collect their surrogate and her son, if they can get them emergency travel documents and she is willing. However, there are no legal routes for surrogates and their families to resettle in the UK. Ukrainians are allowed entry only if they have family members already resident. (A mooted “humanitarian route” has become mired in confusion.) By contrast, Ireland has removed entry requirements for Ukrainian refugees. “This is a small group of women who are carrying British children,” says Gamble. “The UK has a responsibility to protect them.” Gamble wrote to the home secretary recently, asking her to make provision for surrogates who are pregnant with British children, and their families, to come to the UK. The Home Office has not responded. Relatively speaking, Annabel is lucky. Some non-Ukrainian couples have lost contact with their surrogates. “I’m totally heartbroken and losing it,” writes one on a Facebook group. “The agency … is not responding to my emails … I do not have direct contact with the surrogate so I’m unable to reach her. Not sure if she’s OK. Would like to do anything I can to help her and her daughter.” Fabiana Marcela Quaini, an Argentinian lawyer, knows of one client who has lost contact with their surrogate, who is due to give birth next week. Kersch-Kibler and her team are assisting surrogates and parents contracted to other agencies. “We’re trying to help anyone in this situation,” she says. “The parents are desperate to contact the surrogates. One surrogate got in touch to say that her agency was trying to make her get an abortion and she couldn’t get in contact with the intended parents.” Kersch-Kibler understands the parents’ despair. All of the couples using Ukrainian surrogates have tried for years to have families. “This is their last chance,” she says. “For them, that child is precious beyond all words. It’s hard for them to cope with the pictures on TV, knowing their child is in the same country.” Some clients are catastrophising. “I only sleep a few hours a night,” says Jorge, a 48-year-old lawyer from Buenos Aires. He was in a WhatsApp chat with 60 people in the same situation, but left the group. “The group was making me really crazy,” he says. “I can’t avoid watching the news, but the group was too much.” Jorge and his wife tried unsuccessfully to have a baby for a decade. Their surrogate, Katerina, is four months pregnant. She is in Kyiv with her husband and sons and is unable to find a safe route out of the city. “I can’t imagine how a pregnant woman can live in a war with explosions,” says Jorge. “For this reason, I’d prefer for her to come to Argentina, but I can’t decide for her. She’s free. She’s not a slave.” Because Katerina doesn’t speak Spanish and Jorge doesn’t speak Ukrainian, they usually communicate via the agency, but Jorge is trying not to hassle staff there. “I don’t want to disturb them by calling all the time,” he says. “They’re in a war and I have respect. I know the men at the agency have to take up guns to defend their country.” Dmytro Pugach, a 48-year-old fertility lawyer from Kyiv who is coordinating the evacuation of dozens of surrogates, is one of these men. “I have to combine work for life and work for death,” he emails. “I’m helping pregnant surrogates to deliver safely, and fighting in the territorial defence. My Kalashnikov stands beside me as I type this.” Surrogates are being allowed to exit Ukraine with minimal documentation. But this exodus has significant legal ramifications. Under Ukrainian law, intended parents are automatically viewed as the legal parents of children born via surrogacy, but this does not apply in the UK, Ireland or much of Europe. “Some embassies are friendly to surrogacy, but in Austria and Germany surrogacy is not permitted,” says Danchenko. “Parents and surrogates need documents that it’s impossible to provide, as administrative offices are closed.” Parents don’t understand why they can’t fly their babies home without documents. “They are aggressive,” says Danchenko. “They cry. They say: ‘Give me my baby.’ I ask about their documents and they don’t care. I’m a lawyer. What am I supposed to do without documents? That is human trafficking.” Of course, not everyone can leave. One of Pugach’s surrogates is in a town that has been blockaded by Russian forces. She is trapped. Should she need medical attention, her options may be limited. Hospitals and clinics have been attacked. A maternity hospital in the city of Zhytomyr was bombed on 1 March; a Kyiv maternity hospital was hit the day after. On 9 March, a maternity and children’s ward at a hospital in Mariupol was reportedly destroyed by a Russian air strike. At the time of publication, fatalities were not confirmed, but unverified reports indicated that children were buried under the rubble. It is a terrible situation for all involved – and unlikely to be resolved soon. “I pray for the health of Katerina, her sons and her family,” says Jorge. He can’t stop thinking about the last time he saw her, in Kyiv. She was walking to a tram stop, holding a box of chocolates. “I will always remember that image,” Jorge says. “Kyiv was beautiful and peaceful. Now, on the news, I can’t believe what I see.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Will the babies be left in a war zone?’ The terrified Ukrainian surrogates – and the parents waiting for their children,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/10/will-the-babies-be-left-in-a-war-zone-the-terrified-ukrainian-surrogates-and-the-parents-waiting-for-their-children
3/10/2022,"Chelsea have been plunged into a state of limbo after the UK government imposed sanctions on Roman Abramovich, putting the sale of the club on hold and leaving the European champions at risk of falling into financial difficulties. While Chelsea have been granted a special licence that will allow them to fulfil their fixtures, they face an uncertain future after Abramovich’s assets were frozen because of the oligarch’s alleged ties with Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. Broadcast and prize money will be frozen and the licence is limited to “football-related activity”, leaving the west London side unable to sign players, renew existing playing contracts or operate on a commercial level, and means Abramovich will need approval from the UK government before selling the Stamford Bridge club. Abramovich, who has come under intense scrutiny after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, will not be permitted to profit from the sale of Chelsea. Government sources said they are open to considering an application for a new licence that would permit a new owner at Stamford Bridge if a suitable bid emerges, although there is no clarity over where the money from any sale would go at the moment. Discussions are continuing between the Treasury, the Premier League and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. One source said: “The primary thing today is about taking action on oligarchs with close ties to the Kremlin. We’re working through some of those wider implications, including around a potential sale at the moment.” It is understood the decision to sanction Abramovich, which was announced on Thursday morning, has not deterred potential bidders. Sources said a consortium led by Todd Boehly and Hansjörg Wyss has not ended its interest in buying Chelsea. The British property tycoon Nick Candy has also been working on putting a bid together and representatives for Muhsin Bayrak have said the Turkish businessman remains determined to buy the club. For the time being, though, Chelsea are in turmoil. Abramovich cannot put any money into the club or take any out of it. The 55-year-old has given Chelsea £1.5bn worth of loans since buying them in 2003. The club’s latest accounts revealed a loss of £145.6m in the last financial year, although that was put down to the impact of the pandemic. Funding is provided by Fordstam Limited, a company owned by Abramovich. The government’s aim is to target Abramovich rather than Chelsea, which it regards as a “significant cultural asset”. The licence is designed to act as a safety net to protect the club, the Premier League, the game and supporters, with the government aware English football would be damaged if Chelsea were allowed to fall apart. There is an acknowledgement that the licence could be reviewed and that changes could be made once Chelsea have had time to explain their costs to the authorities. But in its current format the licence will force Chelsea to operate under heavy restrictions. They cannot sell match tickets and merchandise sales have been banned, with the club shop closed. Only season-ticket holders and those who have already purchased their tickets will be allowed to attend matches, but catering facilities at Stamford Bridge will remain open. The licence states: “Remuneration, allowances and pensions of all employees of the club, including the wages of players and coaching staff … are payable under obligations which pre-date the date of this licence and are due in the period of this licence.” However Thomas Tuchel, Chelsea’s head coach, faces the prospect of being unable to spend on new signings this summer. If new contracts cannot be handed out then Chelsea will lose Andreas Christensen, Antonio Rüdiger and César Azpilicueta on free transfers. Chelsea’s women’s team could also lose Ann-Katrin Berger, Maren Mjelde, Jonna Andersson, Ji So-yun and Drew Spence as free agents. The licence also permits “reasonable travel costs” to and from fixtures up to a maximum of £20,000, raising questions over how Chelsea will travel to France for the second leg of their last-16 Champions League tie against Lille next week. Chelsea can also spend on “reasonable costs” such as security, stewarding and catering up to £500,000 per match. They can continue payments to and from other clubs for existing transfers and loan deals, broadcasters can show their games and third parties who already have club merchandise in stock can sell it “on the condition that no funds or other financial benefits are made available to the club” or Abramovich. Chelsea’s principal shirt sponsor, the mobile phone network Three, has confirmed it is reviewing its relationship with the club. The deal is believed to be worth £40m a year. The UK has targeted Abramovich as part of its response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine. In a document published by the government on Thursday morning, Chelsea’s owner was identified as “a pro-Kremlin oligarch” and was said to be “associated with a person who is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine and and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, namely Vladimir Putin, with whom Abramovich has had a close relationship for decades”. The document stated that Abramovich has had a close relationship with Russia’s president “for decades” and that the association has led to him benefiting financially. Abramovich has repeatedly and vehemently denied that he is linked to Putin or the Russian state, or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned. The government said: “This association has included obtaining a financial benefit or other material benefit from Putin and the Government of Russia. This includes tax breaks received by companies linked to Abramovich, buying and selling shares from and to the state at favourable rates and the contracts received in the run-up to the 2018 World Cup. Therefore, Abramovich has received preferential treatment and concessions from Putin and the Government of Russia.” It was also claimed that Abramovich “has been involved in destabilising Ukraine and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence ofUkraine, via Evraz PLC,a steel manufacturing and mining company in which Abramovich has a significant shareholding and over which Abramovich exercises effective control”. The government said: “Evraz PLC is or has been involved in providing financial services, or making available funds, economic resources, goods or technology that could contribute to destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine – which includes potentially supplying steel to the Russian military which may have been used in the production of tanks.” Abramovich, under whose ownership Chelsea have won 21 trophies, put the club up for sale last week. He appointed the New York-based bank the Raine Group to oversee the process. There has been speculation that Chelsea’s next owners will come from America. Woody Johnson, the owner of the NFL team the New York Jets, is reportedly readying a bid. Thomas Ricketts, chair of Major League Baseball’s Chicago Cubs, has been mentioned and there is reported interest from Josh Harris, although his stake in Crystal Palace could be a complicating factor. A spokesperson for the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust said: “The CST notes with concern the Government’s statement regarding the owner. Supporters must be involved in any conversation regarding ongoing impacts on the club and its global fan base. The CST implores the Government to conduct a swift process to minimise the uncertainty over Chelsea’s future, for supporters and for supporters to be given a golden share as part of a sale of the club.” When Abramovich put the club up for sale he said he would not call in his loans and announced plans to use the sale of Chelsea to donate funds to the victims of the war in Ukraine. However that fund was not intended solely for Ukrainians, raising the prospect of money going to Russian soldiers or their families.

3/10/2022,"The Labor senator Kimberley Kitching has died suddenly of a suspected heart attack aged 52, prompting tributes from across the political divide. The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said on Thursday night: “The Labor family is in shock tonight at the tragic news that our friend and colleague senator Kimberley Kitching has died suddenly in Melbourne. My sincere condolences to her family. Kimberley will be missed by us all.” The Labor family is in shock tonight at the tragic news that our friend and colleague Senator Kimberley Kitching has died suddenly in Melbourne. My sincere condolences to her family. Kimberley will be missed by us all. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, also offered his condolences, describing Kitching’s death as “a deep and terrible shock”. Morrison paid tribute to Kitching as “a serious parliamentarian who had a deep interest in Australia’s national security”. “She demonstrated that her passion for her country was always greater than any partisan view. She clearly loved her country and it genuinely showed,” Morrison said in a statement. “Senator Kitching was a practising Catholic and we witnessed her authentic faith in the life of the parliament. She followed her conscience and was fearless and I admired that.” Deeply saddened at the news Victorian Labor Senator Kimberley Kitching passed away suddenly today, aged just 52. Our deepest condolences go to her family, friends and colleagues. Kitching, a Victorian senator since 2016, was one of the driving forces for Australia to adopt Magnitsky-style laws allowing the country to introduce targeted sanctions against foreign officials. She celebrated the passage of those laws late last year. Bill Shorten, the former Labor leader and a close friend of the senator, said in a statement: “With a desolate heart I share the news that Kimberley Kitching has passed away. “Kimberley suffered a heart problem Thursday evening in Melbourne and passed soon after,” he said. Shorten said her death was “an immense loss to Labor and the nation”. “As well as her innumerable accolades she has been a wonderful friend to myself, my wife Chloe and our family. To know Kimberley was to be touched not just by her serene intellect but her incredible warmth and vivacity.” Shorten offered his condolences to her husband, Andrew Landeryou, her family and loved ones. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The deputy Labor leader and fellow Victorian, Richard Marles, said he had known Kitching as a friend for more than 30 years and “words cannot express the sadness of this moment”. “Kimberley knew what she stood for and she brought a clarity of thought to her role in the Senate that was rare, she was a fierce advocate for all that she believed in,” Marles said. Kitching was a lawyer, Melbourne city councillor and union leader before she made the move to Canberra. George Brandis, Australia’s high commissioner to the UK and a former Senate colleague, said Kitching was a brilliant senator whose “commitment to upholding and securing Australia’s interests were unquestioned”. Shocked at the death of Senator Kimberley Kitching.Senator Kitching was a brilliant Senator. Her commitment to upholding and securing Australia's interests were unquestioned.I join her many friends in the UK to send prayers to her family at this most difficult moment. GB Kitching, as chair of the Senate’s Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, had been leading an inquiry into Australia’s involvement in Afghanistan. She was a foreign policy hawk who was a prominent supporter of a harder line against Beijing. Together with the Liberal senator James Paterson, Kitching was the Australian co-chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a group of legislators from around the world who have called for democratic countries to rethink the way they engage with China. The alliance calls for democracies to mount “a common defence of shared principles” and to stand up for human rights in their relationships with China.

Party figures had been discussing Kitching’s parliamentary future in recent weeks. She entered the upper house nearly six years ago with Shorten’s strong backing after the resignation of long-serving right faction powerbroker Stephen Conroy sparked a casual Senate vacancy. In her first speech to the Senate, Kitching declared she would “not allow the peddlers of prejudice to deceive Australians against our own interests”. “I come here to represent everyday Australian people: the working Australians, the families, the students, the hospital cleaners, the retail workers, the mortgage holders, the renters, the mums and dads, the 4am shift workers, the nurses, the police, the firefighters and the factory workers,” she said. “And if we fail to remember them – in this place, in our politics, in our public life – then our failure gives room and oxygen to demagogues and those who proffer simplistic answers to complex needs.”",News/Australia news,Labor senator Kimberley Kitching dies suddenly in Melbourne aged 52,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/10/labor-senator-kimberley-kitching-dies-suddenly-in-melbourne-aged-52
3/10/2022,"The Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden’s pay rose by a quarter in 2021 to £6m, as the fossil fuel producer benefited from soaring energy prices amid calls for a windfall tax on energy companies. The FTSE 100 company reported record profits during 2021, thanks in part to a gas price surge in the final three months of the year amid a rebound in demand for commodities as the global economy recovered from coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. Van Beurden’s pay rise, to €7.4m (£6.1m) in 2021 from €5.8m (£4.9m) the year before, came amid widespread calls, including from the Labour party, for booming energy companies to pay a windfall tax on profits as people in Britain and beyond struggle with a cost-of-living crisis. Average weekly earnings for British people rose by 4.3% in the year to December, meaning their real wages fell because of inflation, caused in part by higher energy prices. Van Beurden was paid 57 times more than the median Shell worker in 2021, according to the company’s annual report. Luke Hildyard, a director of the High Pay Centre, a campaign group, said: “Shell’s chief executive rakes in millions and half their UK employees make well over £100,000. Oil and gas companies have argued that money for a windfall tax would have to come from their budget earmarked for long-term investments. But when they are paying out such huge sums to wealthy investors and top earning staff that argument looks laughably weak. “Businesses that truly want to serve society should be happy to contribute a slightly higher rate of tax at a time when they are having a bonanza year, through pure good luck rather than their own hard work or innovation, while society as a whole is struggling with rising costs, stagnating wages and further economic turmoil.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused energy prices to rise further since the start of the year, suggesting that even higher bills may be likely for households and businesses. Van Beurden was forced to withdraw Shell from its joint ventures with Kremlin-controlled oil firm Gazprom worth a total of $3bn, including drilling projects at the Sakhalin-II liquefied natural gas facility, projects in Salym and Gydan, both in western Siberia, and its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has been cancelled since the invasion. Shell announced this week it would stop buying Russian oil or gas, and would close its 500 petrol stations in the country. The petrol stations closures have prompted a $400m writedown on assets. Van Beurden said last week: “Our decision to exit is one we take with conviction.” However, in his foreword to the annual report he described the exit as “in line with government guidance”, referring to the heavy pressure thought to be exerted by the UK government as it sought to isolate Russia’s economy. The company awarded Van Beurden €5.4m in bonuses and long-term incentive payments, on top of his €2m fixed pay. He also received a “motoring allowance” of €14,400 and money to pay for transport between his home and the office of €2,494. He will also be paid moving costs and a housing allowance for two years after relocating from the Netherlands to London at the company’s request. Shell paused Van Beurden’s annual bonus during the first year of the pandemic. Before that he received €10m in 2019 and €20m in 2018, a record if excluding 2014 when pension calculations inflated his reported salary.",News/Business,Shell chief’s pay rose by a quarter in 2021 to £6m,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/10/shell-chief-pay-ben-van-beurden-oil
3/10/2022,"Tomb of Sand by Indian writer Geetanjali Shree has become the first book translated from Hindi to be nominated for the International Booker prize. The judges praised the “loud and irresistible” tale of an elderly woman who gains a new lease of life after her husband’s death. The 64-year-old author’s fifth novel is among 13 titles in competition for the prestigious award for translated fiction, a £50,000 prize split evenly between author and translator. This year, the shortlisted authors and translators will also each receive £2,500, rather than the £1,000 they were given previously. The 2022 longlist includes books from 12 countries and translated from 11 languages. Shree and her translator Daisy Rockwell are up against previous winner and Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk, whose epic novel The Books of Jacob has been called her “magnum opus”, and took Jennifer Croft seven years to translate. Marcel Theroux said in his Guardian review that this 900-page chronicle of an 18th-century Polish Jew who claimed to be the messiah “will be a landmark in the life of any reader with the appetite to tackle it”. Previous winners David Grossman and his translator Jessica Cohen have also made this year’s longlist for More Than I Love My Life, a multigenerational family novel described as “scrupulous” and “anguished” by Guardian reviewer Alex Clark.

The small not-for-profit press mostly publishes Asian writers and was founded in 2015 by Deborah Smith, who translated the Man Booker International prize-winning The Vegetarian by Han Kang. The 2022 longlist, which as usual is dominated by titles from independent presses, is the first time Tilted Axis has had books selected by the prize. The angst of teenage years is a common theme on the longlist: Tomb of Sand’s protagonist, Ma, looks back at her troubled adolescence, while Fernanda Melchor’s Paradais centres on two misfit teenage boys who plan a terrible crime and Heaven by Mieko Kawakami is narrated by a bullied 14-year-old. Family relations are also explored, from Grossman’s More Than I Love My Life, in which a strong-willed daughter returns to her family, to Violaine Huisman’s tale of a daughter’s love for her volatile “Maman”, The Book of Mother. Chair of judges Frank Wynne said that “spending the past year in the company of some of the world’s great writers and their equally gifted translators has been a kind of heaven. From the intimate to the epic, the numinous to the profane, the books make up a passionately debated longlist that traces a ring around the world.” He believes that the chosen books “explore the breadth and depth of human experience, and are a testament to the power of language and literature”. Wynne, who is the first translator to head the prize’s judging panel, selected the longlist with four fellow judges: author and academic Merve Emre; writer and lawyer Petina Gappah; writer and comedian Viv Groskop and translator and author Jeremy Tiang. The International Booker was founded in 2005 in order to complement the Booker prize for English-language fiction. Last year’s winner was At Night All Blood Is Black by French novelist David Diop, translated by Anna Moschovakis.

3/10/2022,"About 140 years before its designation as a national park, William Wordsworth described the Lake District as “a sort of national property in which every man has a right and an interest”. Like other English national parks, however, this one is mostly in private hands. It also lacks the wilderness associated with designated landscapes elsewhere. But it is firmly a public asset: loved by millions, and subject to the demands of landowners, tenants, taxpayers and visitors from around the world. For generations these demands have centred on agricultural heritage and aesthetics, but increasingly prominent on the list of “what the Lake District ought to do for us” are ecosystem services such as carbon storage, water management and biodiversity. Lee Schofield is a country boy who grew into an ecologist and conservationist, and as such he embodies the “messy middle” in the old and wearisome war between town and country. He’s an easy person to like – thoughtful, quietly spoken, a watcher and listener, a writer and singer of folky songs. But he’s found himself in a place and a job in which perhaps his most important characteristic is resilience. The place is Haweswater in the north-eastern edge of the Lake District national park, and the job is overseeing the ecological restoration of a landscape on behalf of the RSPB, who rent the land from United Utilities. The site includes Haweswater reservoir and two traditional hill farms. To the ecologist’s eye, centuries of sheep grazing on these fells have created a denuded landscape. To Schofield, it is a landscape of ghosts: those of pine martens, corncrakes and black grouse, and golden eagles (the last in England, a lone male, lived here until 2015), and everywhere the shadows of lost woodlands and absent alpine flowers. Of these, a few species cling on by the narrowest of margins, national rarities, relegated to remote crags inaccessible to grazing animals, in particular sheep. His job is not only to restore biodiversity and abundance, and the ability of the land to hold water and carbon, but to prove that it can be done alongside traditional farming. Reducing the number of sheep is hugely controversial, not least because of the practical implications for neighbouring farms. The high ground where sheep spend the summer is common land and stock are hefted, which is to say they learn to stick to their patch without being fenced in. A lighter grazing regime creates grass that is literally greener, not to mention studded with diverse and delicious herbs: an irresistible temptation to animals on adjacent hefts. Other objections are deeply cultural. Hill farming heritage is imprinted on lives as well as landscape here, and in pursuit of the recent Unesco world heritage site designation of the Lake District, proponents have committed to the preservation of cultural heritage even where it is at odds with climate and biodiversity considerations. As a measure of the mismatch, consider that the presence of the RSPB at Haweswater was described by a member of the world heritage site steering group as a wart on the face of the bid. It’s a relief to leave the contested fells for a bit, to glimpse other ways of farming hills. In sojourns to Norway and the Italian Alps, Schofield describes highly traditional farms operating in biodiverse landscapes – energising intimations of what might be. No one person and no one organisation can bring about the necessary change, but Schofield is doing more than most, and the vision he paints, of a fecund, collaborative, ecologically and economically sustainable future, is worth swallowing some pride for on both sides. The ranks of farmers willing to embrace or at least consider change swell year on year, and Lee is supported by a thriving local conservation community. The results speak for themselves. In summer, the hay meadows of this part of the park are a flickering, bobbing sea of flowers and butterflies, and the once canalised Swindale Beck now jinks around its old meandering course, glinting over clean gravels where salmon are spawning again. Schofield is a delightfully companionable guide – evoking huge vistas alongside small, exquisite, multisensory details – you can almost inhale the scent of thyme and warm rock wafting from the pages.

3/10/2022,"Oil and gas companies and lobby groups in Canada are heavily investing in campaigns to present themselves as defenders of Indigenous interests in the face of high-profile protests against a controversial natural gas pipeline on First Nation land, a new investigation by Eco-Bot.Net and the Guardian has found. “I’m being a steward to my land and I’m being a defender,” read one of 21 ads targeting British Columbia in November 2021, quoting a Coastal GasLink worker from Nak’azdli Whut’en’ First Nation. As the ad conveying Indigenous support for the pipeline appeared on the Facebook and Instagram feeds of people in the Canadian province, 30 Wet’suwet’en Nation members and supporters were being violently evicted from their territory along the pipeline. Police breached two cabins with an axe, chainsaw, dog unit and snipers aimed at the door. “The thing I remember most is the dogs … barking and whining, pulling their leashes trying to get at you,” recounts Sleydo’ Molly Wickham, a member of the Gidimt’en Clan of the Wet’suwet’en, who was arrested. A recording the police put out over their radios also left a strong imprint on her memory. “They were playing a horror film audio. You know, where the little child sings ‘I know where you are, I’m gonna get you, I’m coming for you.’” The fossil fuel groups spent some C$122,000 (US$95,249) on more than 400 targeted Facebook and Instagram ads over the past two years relating to various oil and gas projects throughout the country. The ads spiked last November during Indigenous land defense actions on the Coastal GasLink pipeline in British Columbia and solidarity protests across Canada. The vast majority of the ads, which were shown some 21m times in total, were linked to the Coastal GasLink pipeline, the site of intense protest and violent police crackdown in recent years. Coastal GasLink is one of three multibillion-dollar pipelines facing opposition by some Indigenous and environmental groups in Canada. The construction of the 670km pipeline through unceded Wet’suwet’en territory – land never signed away to the Canadian government – has sparked nationwide protests in recent years. The pipeline has also exacerbated complex divisions within the Wet’suwet’en First Nation, some of whom favor the economic opportunities promised by the project. Analysis of Facebook advertisements from January 2020 to the present by Eco-Bot.Net, a research project exposing climate crisis misinformation and corporate greenwashing online, has found a steady flow of “Indigenous-washing” ad campaigns from TC Energy, the company behind the pipeline, and associated oil and gas lobby groups. TC Energy accounts for almost three-quarters of the ad spend and impressions investigated. As recently as mid-February, the company ran two such ads – both of which were removed by Facebook for running without a disclaimer that includes information on who paid for the advert. In October last year, solidarity protests were held in British Columbia and other parts of the country after a Wet’suwet’en hereditary chief was arrested for blocking pipeline construction. Over the subsequent five week period, TC Energy and affiliated groups launched dozens of ads which were shown 1.7m times across Canada. Together they paid C$14,000 to Meta, Facebook and Instagram’s parent company. Advertising rose in the days after the chief’s arrest, and then spiked during the enforcement of a court injunction to remove land defenders. About half of these ads were targeted at British Columbia, with some ads reaching viewers from within a small “estimated audience size”, indicating that ads used Meta’s interest-based micro-targeting tools. It is not possible to determine the precise audiences targeted, but one Indigenous activist interviewed reported being regularly bombarded with the ads. “The upticks in industry spending on ads directed at specific demographics and coinciding with protests appear to be classic examples of financially motivated, politically oriented, micro-targeted public affairs campaigns,” said Harvard University climate disinformation researcher Geoffrey Supran. “There are no better predictors of fossil fuel industry ad spending than political action and media attention, and this data appears to be a case in point.” Launched during the Cop26 climate talks and founded by artist and disinformation researcher Bill Posters and Massive Attack’s Rob Del Naja, Eco-Bot.Net scrapes databases of social media advertising paid for by some of the world’s most polluting companies. Eco-Bot.Net defines corporate greenwashing as a tactic used to mislead consumers about the green credentials of a product or service, or about the environmental performance of a company. Some researchers use the term Indigenous-washing to refer to the tactic by high-polluting companies to mislead the public about their relationship to Indigenous peoples and their land. Working with Meta’s Ad Library, the investigation used keyword searches such as “Indigenous” or “First Nations” in conjunction with “pipeline” or “oil”, to identify Indigenous-washing actors in Canada. Journalists and disinformation researchers, including the two authors of this article, then analyzed all of the ads run by the accounts of these groups in 2020 and 2021. Using terminology such as land “defender”, “eco-colonialism” and “reconciliation”, the ads employ buzzwords and phrases used in Indigenous rights discourse to portray the oil and gas companies as aligned with Indigenous groups.“The very fact that they’re pushing [these ads] is like a drowning man getting caught in a swift river. A piece of straw goes by and he wants to grab it, hoping it’ll save him,” said the Wet’suwet’en hereditary chief Na’Moks, who opposes the pipeline. Last year, Joe Biden revoked a permit for the cross-border Keystone XL pipeline, which is also owned by TC Energy. Indigenous groups and environmentalists had opposed the pipeline for more than decade. TC Energy is seeking $15bn in damages from the US government. Another spike in the ads found by Eco-Bot.Net went on for almost three months at the start of 2020. The ads were placed amidst nationwide backlash to an injunction barring land defenders from blocking Coastal GasLink construction. TC Energy and associated lobby groups spent some C$52,000 during this period, resulting in 12m social media impressions in Canada. The ads initially targeted British Columbia but shifted to other parts of the country where solidarity protests were strong, such as Ontario. The end of this spike coincided with declarations of a “state of emergency” across Canada’s provinces, which put a stop to large gatherings in order to mitigate the spread of Covid. Lobby groups paying for the ads include the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), which count Coastal GasLink pipeline partners Shell, Petronas Energy and PetroChina as members. Another involved lobby group, the Canadian Energy Centre, is financed by the Government of Alberta’s Technology, Innovation and Emissions Reduction fund, which oil and gas companies, including TC Energy, pay into. Earlier this month, land defenders filed a submission to the UN Human Rights Council detailing police raids in recent years, which have resulted in the arrests of 74 people. The Guardian revealed that in one of those raids, officers were prepared to use lethal force against land defenders. The UN submission argues that Canada is violating several articles under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. But the social media adverts tell a different story. “Meet Shirley & Alma, Wet’suwet’en members who see the opportunities Coastal GasLink is bringing to their community,” reads one advert. Another says that land defenders are “disrupting potentially game changing opportunities for Indigenous communities”. The strategy of elevating the views of Indigenous people who are in favour of the pipeline “pits folks against each other in our communities, driving that divide and conquer tactic that we’ve encountered every step of the way since colonisation,” said Karla Tait, a member of the Gilseyhu Clan of the Wet’suwet’en. Hereditary chiefs mostly oppose the pipeline, believing that treating natural resources as commodities is fundamentally at odds with Wet’suwet’en responsibilities to the land. But band chiefs and councils – who are democratically elected as part of an administrative structure imposed during colonisation – are generally in favour, saying the pipeline will help lift the Wet’suwet’en Nation from poverty. Throughout the project, TC Energy has negotiated with the Wet’suwet’en bands for access to the land rather than hereditary chiefs. Facebook adverts suggest broad support from the Wet’suwet’en by only promoting the company’s agreements with the bands. The pipeline, however, cuts across unceded Wet’suwet’en territory and so remains under the jurisdiction of hereditary chiefs, according to a 1997 supreme court ruling, although the judgment allows for “the infringement of aboriginal title”. In response to a request for comment, TC Energy and CAPP reiterated their support from the band councils, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said it had no choice but to enforce the injunction. The Government of British Columbia, the Canadian Energy Centre and the Wet’suwet’en band chiefs and councils contacted by the Guardian did not provide comment. In the ads, oil and gas development is portrayed as necessary for Indigenous economic development and poverty alleviation. “A strong oil and gas sector is key for Indigenous education and prosperity,” reads one ad, alongside an image of a Siksika First Nation woman standing next to a tipi. Ads like this “appear to reduce local Indigenous communities to a homogeneous, single-minded population, which presumably misrepresents the cultural and political diversities and complexities of this situation”, said Supran. “We live in communities where there’s very few economic opportunities, and jobs are few and far between. So I don’t begrudge anyone that takes a job with the pipelines,” said Tait, who was arrested during the February 2020 raids along with her mother and aunt. Natural gas projects receive billions of dollars’ worth of subsidies from the British Columbia government, which says it views the pipeline as “a pathway to prosperity” for First Nations. According to the YellowHead Institute, a First Nation-led research centre, this makes government support for First Nations “contingent upon support for pipeline deals”. Leaders like Chief Na’Moks do not see the pipeline build as a viable route to prosperity. “We as hereditary chiefs have to think thousands of years in the future,” he said. “We protect our lands.

3/10/2022,"In much of the soccer world, the US women’s team and players such as Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan are beloved superstars and powerful voices for equal rights. Many in the rank-and-file of US Soccer don’t share that sentiment though. In their eyes, the US national teams – particularly the women – are bleeding the federation dry while leaving precious little for grassroots associations charged with overcoming the sport’s stagnation and decline among young players. That’s one of the takeaways from last week’s US Soccer presidential election, in which incumbent Cindy Cone barely held onto her position – by a margin of 52.9% to 47.1% in the weighted-vote tally – after a strong insurgent campaign by Carlos Cordeiro, who had resigned just two years ago and handed the reins to then vice-president Cone. Cone’s bloc of elite athletes and pro leagues barely held on to power against the state youth and adult associations along with a few other voting entities such as US Youth Soccer. On the surface, supporting Cordeiro made little sense. His bungling ended when he took the fall for an insulting (and, given the rest of the case, wholly unnecessary) legal brief in the lawsuit brought by the US women’s team. It wasn’t his only misstep. He was clumsy in the spotlight, with comments more cringeworthy than anything Ricky Gervais could conjure. He dithered over the hiring of a new CEO who might have flagged that offensive brief or improved a work environment described as toxic. Recent revelations have shown the federation failed to react to reports of systemic abuse of women’s players from youth level to the pros. Cordeiro touted his ability to navigate the world of high finance, but there were hints of a sponsor revolt had he won. Cone therefore inherited a mess, just as Covid appeared and made her job even tougher. She also had to deal with a federal mandate that gave national team players more power within the federation – a decision out of her hands but nevertheless resented by the grassroots types. On the surface, Cone did well. The budget was stabilized, she settled a pointless legal fight with the US Soccer Foundation that had been brought on by Cordeiro’s arrogance, landed a new broadcast deal with Turner Sports, and brokered a tentative settlement in the high-profile women’s team lawsuit that has cost the federation a lot of money and goodwill. Unsurprisingly, many women’s team players either formally or informally endorsed Cone, a Hall of Famer who played for the team two decades ago. “The US Soccer Federation needs a leader who will move our sport forward, not backward,” read a letter from 18 players. The letter didn’t mention Cordeiro. It didn’t have to. Most fans of the women’s team surely shared the players’ opinion. A straw poll by supporters’ organization the American Outlaws ran 91% in favor of Cone. “If Carlos Cordeiro is elected we riot,” read a tweet from The Women’s Soccer Show. That was a risk the grassroots organizations were willing to take. Officially, their biggest complaint was that the people working at ground level felt neglected. Cone and her staff have been seen as aloof, focusing more on the national teams than on the members who play a vital role in growing the game. “Our current US Soccer culture has created a division between the ‘Elites’ and the ‘Grassroots,’” US Youth Soccer chair Dr Pete Zopfi, who produced an election-eve endorsement for Cordeiro, wrote in an email to the Guardian. “Hopefully what we heard and saw before the election about ‘working with all members’ was not just political rhetoric.” If the problem was simply time and attention, that might not be so bad. But the biggest complaints were about money. State associations raised pointed questions about paltry spending on grassroots needs such as referee programs in comparison to the big numbers – the men’s national team is budgeted at a loss of $13.6m, with the women set to lose nearly $10.8m. To an extent, the federation can point to sponsorship revenue that’s listed separately and is surely driven primarily by the national teams. But the budget shows an overall loss of $30.67m. That will prompt some resentment toward both national teams. But the women were particularly outspoken against Cordeiro, and the states have been particularly disdainful of the USWNT. And the settlement of the women’s lawsuit, seen in some quarters as a piece of news conveniently timed to help Cone win reelection, may have had the opposite effect, furthering resentment toward the team. Assuming a new collective bargaining agreement can be reached, which isn’t a sure thing, the women’s lawsuit will be settled for a fee of $24m. In the states’ eyes, that’s $24m they won’t be getting. Forget the argument that the women needed to win the case to set an example for young girls. To the grassroots groups, the settlement and the projected losses are actually robbing girls and boys of the support they need. Even worse, the sport is attracting fewer and fewer participants. Cone is hardly responsible for creating the long-running problem, but the states would argue that fixing it should be a higher priority than it is. To be sure, some of the state representatives have other motives. While the US women’s team and its fans are often held up as a beacon of progressive values, the same isn’t true of soccer as a whole in the US. The game, particularly at youth level, is popular in America’s conservative heartland, and some are still bitter about women’s players kneeling during the national anthem. Others think the women’s team is too cozy with former player Cone. And it’s easy to see that there are sexist elements to some of the complaints. After all, the US men’s team lost more money than the women’s team, while some of the members who supported former men’s players such as Eric Wynalda or Kyle Martino in the 2018 election now suddenly tout the need for “business acumen” with a female player at the helm. But those motivations are hardly the only driving forces behind the grassroots revolt. The states and other organizations believe they see through the women’s team’s rhetoric. If the USWNT are serious about fighting for girls and future generations, they say, shouldn’t the bulk of revenue be going to develop coaches, referees and players? Cone has recognized that she has some bridge-building to do. The national teams must do so as well. The men are still taking a rigid negotiating stance even though all available evidence shows they are more than adequately paid. And with men’s players now commanding large salaries from European powerhouses as well as MLS teams, it’s difficult to make a case that they need big money from international appearances to pad their incomes. The women, though, have more work to do. They’ve convinced a lot of supporters and columnists that their legal fight was essential. Now they need to convince those who actually look at the federation budget. And all federation members, from volunteers to the well-compensated national teamers, have to find a way to put things together. Otherwise, even with Cone in charge rather than Cordeiro, US Soccer may indeed go backward.",Sport/Football,The women’s team got equal pay but not everyone in US soccer is happy,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/10/the-womens-team-got-equal-pay-but-not-everyone-in-us-soccer-is-happy
3/10/2022,"The John Lewis Partnership has restored its staff bonus after narrowing losses to £26m last year. The department store group, which is staff-owned and also operates Waitrose supermarkets, said it would pay a 3% bonus to workers, equivalent to 1.5 weeks pay. A year ago it said it would not be paying a bonus to staff, known as partners as they jointly own the company via a trust, for the first time in 67 years and was unlikely to pay a bonus this year after slumping to a £517m loss for 2020. JLP also said it would pay all partners at least the independently verified living wage of £9.90 across the UK, a 2% pay rise. Sharon White, the chairman, said on Thursday: “With our partners, like the whole country, facing a cost-of-living squeeze, we believe that this is the right time to pay the voluntary real living wage, nationwide.” The company said it was investing £54m in additional pay excluding bonus. The improved deal for workers came after John Lewis said sales rose 1% to £12.5bn in 2021. The John Lewis department stores increased sales to £4.9bn, its highest level. Sales at established Waitrose stores rose 1%, helping lift the total to £7.5bn for the grocery chain.",News/Business,John Lewis restores staff bonus as losses narrow,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/10/john-lewis-restores-staff-bonus-losses-narrow-department-store
