3/9/2022,"What can we make of the markets right now? On Friday, we saw the February jobs numbers – and they were far above the expectations. The economy added 678,000 jobs in the month, against a forecast of 400,000, and the official unemployment rate ticked down to 3.8%. It was the best jobs print of the ‘pandemic era.’ But it didn’t move the dial. The war in Ukraine did, and that movement wasn’t positive. All three of Wall Street’s major benchmarks are down as this week gets started, capping a weeks-long string of high market volatility overlaid on a downward trend. The NASDAQ leads the way, down 2.3%. This leaves the average retail investor wondering just how to recognize stocks with real potential. After all, one of the few certainties of unsettled market conditions like we’re seeing now is that the ‘normal’ signs and signals have broken down. So maybe it’s time to check in with the market’s major institutions, the ones that, to a degree, set the rules in the first place. This can bring us to a Wall Street giant like JPMorgan. JPMorgan isn’t just any giant bank; it’s the giant of the giants, the largest US bank, and the world’s fifth largest by total assets. And this behemoth to the market has picked out two beaten-down stocks that investors need to watch for a rebound. Using TipRanks’ database, we found out that the rest of the Street is also on board as both have earned a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Grid Dynamics Holdings (GDYN) We’ll start with Grid Dynamics, a provider of consulting, analytics, and engineering services in the digital transformation niche. In short, Grid Dynamics is a tech company that helps other companies make digital upgrades, especially upgrades to cloud-based operations. This Silicon Valley tech firm has taken a hard hit in recent months. The stock peaked in December of 2021 with a price just above $42. Since then, it has tumbled badly, losing 75% of its share value in just over 2 months. That loss came even as the company expanded its operational footprint and reported solid quarterly earnings. On the expansion side, Grid Dynamics announced in February that it was entering the Indian market via a strategic partnership with Cygnet Infotech. The move gives the company a larger presence in South Asia, a rapidly growing economic region with a population of some 1.5 billion. The partnership is the first phase of a long term plan for South Asia expansion that will go into next year. On the earnings side, the company reported its 4Q21 results early this month, and showed a record level quarterly top line of $66.5 million, more than double the $30.1 million reported in the year-ago quarter. At the bottom line, the non-GAAP diluted EPS came in at 10 cents, 2.5x the 4 cents reported one year ago, and 11% higher than the 9-cent forecast. However, like many tech firms, Grid Dynamics hires talent where it finds it – and the company had found a lot of such talent in Ukraine. Grid Dynamics’ website lists 217 positions open in Kharkiv, 206 in Kyiv, and another 196 in Lvov. The company’s exposure to the Russia-Ukraine war is a headwind that cannot be avoided. In covering GDYN for JPMorgan, analyst Puneet Jain notes this exposure, but believes the stock price has fallen far enough to reflect that headwind. “Given the recent Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we are proactively setting a lower bar for 2022 growth. We assume a reasonably adverse case scenario in which the ongoing turmoil persists for more than a few weeks, and leads IT buyers to delay new projects or award them to other countries (no impact on existing work). We'd also expect the company to increase focus on ramping up other countries/regions, and service incremental demand from elsewhere, but conservatively assume a near term headwind (mostly 1Q/2Q) to get 16% organic growth in CY22 (vs. 20% before). However, we think that recent stock weakness more than adequately discounts the risk of a slower revenue growth rate,"" Jain opined. Looking forward, Jain gives this stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, along with a $23 price target that implies an upside of 137% for the coming year. (To watch Jain’s track record, click here) While Grid Dynamics has fallen sharply recently, Wall Street still gives it a Strong Buy rating. That consensus is based on 5 recent reviews, including 4 to Buy and 1 to Hold. The shares are selling for $9.82 and their $21.70 average price target suggests ~121% upside potential. (See GDYN stock forecast on TipRanks) Singular Genomics Systems (OMIC) Now we’ll change pace and head over to a medical research company. Singular Genomics is working on multiomics technologies, the next generation of genetic sequencing and the tools that are set to build a new wave of genetically-based medicines and medical products. Singular Genomics made another large stride in that path last quarter, 4Q of 2021, when it launched its G4 platform. This platform, the company’s latest, is a benchtop genome sequencer, offering greater accuracy, flexibility, speed, and power to boost applications in oncological and immunological research. G4 instrument kits are now in production, and first kits are in internal testing. The company expects to commence deliveries in 2Q22. G4 deliveries, when they start, will be a major leap for Singular Genomics, as it will also mark the start of a revenue stream. For the now, the company remains highly speculative for investors, dependent on raising capital to offset operating expenses and losses. Singular Genomics went public last year, with an IPO at the end of May, and since then has seen the share price gradually fall by 73%. JPMorgan's 5-star analyst Tycho Peterson lays out a strong case for Singular Genomics to reach profitability in the near future, writing: “Overall, we are encouraged by the continued early launch progress of the G4 and the pipeline. While 2022 is set to be a busy year for the sequencing industry with multiple recent and upcoming competitive launches (ILMN, PACB/Omniome Element Biosciences, Ultima), OMIC remains confident in its competitive differentiation around throughput and cost (and accuracy once HD-Seq launches). With a differentiated technology and strong IP position, as well as unique value propositions in target applications, OMIC has an encouraging prospect of driving attractive revenue growth and margin expansion, and we believe solid commercial progress will drive multiple expansion over time…” To this end, Peterson gives OMIC shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and sets a $25 price target that indicates his confidence in a robust 250% potential upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Peterson’s track record, click here) Judging by the consensus breakdown, opinions are anything but mixed. With 3 Buys and no Holds or Sells assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that OMIC is a Strong Buy. At $23, the average price target implies ~222% upside potential.

3/9/2022,"What do you get when you combine: a fading stock market, frozen central bank assets (including oligarchs), widespread credit downgrades, getting kicked off SWIFT, potential cyberattacks, spiking inflation, evaporating fiscal and monetary stimulus, and Fed interest rate hikes? In my opinion, the perfect recipe for collapse. DOW DAILY CHART: Stocks may be entering the sharp breakdown I’ve been forecasting. Strong downside follow-through that finishes below the February low (32,300) would confirm a repeat of the 2018 taper-tantrum and project a decline to 29,700 by March 25 (+/- a trading day). If selling accelerates faster than anticipated (very possible), then a trip to fill the open price gap at 28,500 becomes likely. I don’t like being so pessimistic, but things could get ugly over the next few weeks. Markets could plunge further than expected. If prices do plummet, I’ll be on the lookout for rare opportunities.

3/9/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -Russia's rouble fell sharply in thin trading on Monday to a fresh record low, with local markets closed for trading until at least Wednesday. The rouble has lost nearly 50% of its value against the greenback since the start of the year, with losses sharply accelerating since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, a move that sparked sweeping sanctions from various governments across the world. The rouble bids were indicated as far as 150 to the dollar after closing at 121.037 on Friday, according to Refinitiv data. On the EBS trading platform, the rouble weakened as far as 160 to the dollar, or more than 22%, and was recently traded at 145, down 14.5% on the day. Bid/ask spreads were between 7 and 15 cents, pointing to an increasingly illiquid market. Trading on the MOEX Moscow exchange is scheduled to be closed until Wednesday for a bank holiday. The curbs on Russia, its lenders, corporates and key individuals, as well as counter measures from Moscow, have cut Russian assets increasingly out of global financial markets and have made it hard for investors to trade any securities. ""The future doesn’t look bright for the Russian rouble at all,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote. ""The combination of western sanctions, the rising risk of default and the incentive to divest from rouble-denominated assets will likely further weigh on the currency."" Stocks last traded on Feb. 25 on Moscow's bourse. An ETF of Russian and Russia-exposed companies traded in the United States was halted on Friday after dropping nearly 80% year-to-date. Five-year credit default swaps in Russia - reflecting the cost to insure exposure to the country's sovereign debt - soared to a record 2,757 basis points compared to 1,725 basis points on Friday, data from IHS Markit showed. Trades on Russia's sovereign dollar- and euro-denominated debt have all but ground to a halt, with some issues bid at around 20 cents in the dollar or euro. ""With Russian prices on the euro bond somewhere around 20, this is going to go on for a long, long time, and nobody wants to be associated with (the rouble),"" said Gabriel Sterne, head of global EM research at Oxford Economics. ""Just sell it and take a loss. You have to interpret the price movements as: there's almost infinite supply and very little demand for these assets at the moment. It's now just a matter of an orderly disposal of Russian assets."" Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation."" Rouble implied volatility gauges - a measure of demand for options on the currency rising or falling against the dollar - have stayed near record highs hit last week, with the one-week gauge above 84% and the one-month one above 94%. The rouble's collapse has also hit trading volumes. Turnover on the Russian currency on EBS fell more than 80% on Friday compared to the end of February.

3/9/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The head of the biggest U.S. oil lobby groups said the Biden administration is “misusing facts” when it claims the industry has more than 9,000 federal drilling permits on which it can drill to boost supply and ease soaring energy prices.

The Biden administration has repeatedly pointed to the number of approved but untapped drilling permits on federal land when questioned about how U.S. production can rise, and what the federal government can do to help. “There’s a fundamental misunderstanding of the administration as to how the process actually works,” Sommers said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. “Just because you have a lease doesn’t mean there’s actually oil and gas in that lease, and there has to be a lot of development that occurs between the leasing and then ultimately permitting for that acreage to be productive,” he said. “I think that they’re purposefully misusing the facts here to advantage their position.” Sommers said the Biden administration should support policies that promote U.S. oil and gas production over OPEC+, which includes Russian oil. The U.S. and its allies are considering banning imports of Russia crude after the country invaded Ukraine.

3/9/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- As equity markets sink around the world, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. strategists say a perfect storm looks to be gathering.

This is a potential “game-changer,” eroding their conviction on the prospects of risk assets, they wrote. Earnings delivery is “paramount” at a time when liquidity is being sucked out by central banks across the world, the Citi strategists said. “Removing this support could leave some indices floating on air.” A ferocious rally in developed market stocks came to an abrupt end at the start of this year amid concerns that record inflation readings will cause central banks to aggressively tighten policy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered another spike in commodity prices, adding to fears that economies are heading to a stagflationary shock. Several major benchmark gauges across Europe have dropped more than 20% from their recent highs, while the S&P 500 is hovering around a 10% correction. With gas and oil prices soaring, Citi and Morgan Stanley strategists say “demand destruction” may now be unavoidable. Optimists Wavering “Any relief should be sold,” said Wilson. “We recommend staying defensively oriented by running less risk than normal and searching for companies with superior operational efficiency and earnings stability.” While the Morgan Stanley strategist has consistently been one of Wall Street’s most outspoken bears, even optimists are now wavering.

3/9/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s decision to block foreign owners from seizing hundreds of planes worth about $10 billion is roiling a market where aircraft leases are bundled into bonds and sold to investors. Most Read from Bloomberg China Warns U.S. Over Forming Pacific NATO, Backing Taiwan Biden to Sign Crypto Order as Firms Face Sanctions Pressure Ukraine Update: Russia’s Gas Threat; Cease-Fire Talks Struggle U.S. and U.K. Poised for Ban on Imports of Russian Oil Today Covid Can Shrink the Brain as Much as a Decade of Aging, Study Finds European Union sanctions imposed on Russia because of its Ukraine invasion give plane owners until March 28 to retrieve the vehicles. But only a handful have been extracted, and hopes for more are dim. And so some asset-backed securities in the aviation space are coming under duress as a result. Although these types of transactions are designed to survive cash flow problems at the airlines leasing the planes, fully losing access to planes under these circumstances almost guarantees that lease payments that feed these ABS deals will soon dry up, with recourse uncertain. “It will be interesting to watch, as potentially the bottom capital structure could start to see losses,” said Jennifer Thomas, portfolio manager at Loomis, Sayles & Co. The situation has already had a chilling effect on over two dozen aircraft ABS deals that are exposed to the region, with investors fearing some tranches within those deals might take losses. Among the ones most exposed are two from Carlyle Aviation -- one with 44% and another with 37% of lease payments tied to Russia or Ukraine -- and two others from Castlelake Aviation. Kroll Bond Ratings is evaluating whether to downgrade nine deals, worth roughly $2.9 billion in total, including the Carlyle and Castlelake ones. Moody’s Investors Service has done the same to one Castlelake ABS. According to a March 7 note from the credit rater, the deal will see reduced cash flow due to “foregone lease income tied to early lease terminations and increased transaction costs stemming from potentially prolonged repossession and remarketing timelines associated with the aircraft on lease to Russian airlines.” Read more: Nine Aircraft ABS on Watch Due to Russia’s War in Ukraine: KBRA Some deals have already moved frantically in the secondary market. A refinancing of a Castlelake aircraft-lease asset-backed bond originally issued in 2017 plunged in value in early March after the Russian invasion, losing 17 cents on the dollar in a single day, according to Empirasign. The bond, known as CLAST 2017-1R, tranche B, was marked as high as 99.8 cents on Dec. 31 and plummeted to about 82 cents on March 1, Empirasign said. It’s currently at 83.25 cents. The ABS has about a 20% exposure to Russia, according to S&P. Read more: Russia-Exposed Castlelake Aircraft ABS Fell in Trading Investors are trying to get insurers to pay for losses, but that could be an uphill battle. By Feb. 26, EU-based insurers and reinsurers were required to stop providing coverage of planes to Russia-based airlines, while in Ukraine, some insurers have already withdrawn their coverage for aircraft leased and located in the country despite a lack of sanctions. Although lessors have their own insurance policies, insurers may find a way to not pay them back, Moody’s said. “Insurers may take steps to unilaterally cancel some policies, subject to required notice periods, before lessors incur losses, which could limit lessors’ recoveries and add to potential future loss in the transactions.” Elsewhere in credit markets: Americas At least five of the eight companies looking to issue new U.S. investment-grade debt opted to stand down Tuesday ahead of the U.S. decision to ban Russian energy imports.
