4/4/2022,"The Welsh artist Roy Powell, who has died aged 87, was a distinguished painter in both oil and watercolour, particularly in the still-life “vanitas” tradition. His distinctive paintings, as with those of his biggest influence, Cézanne, emerge from a contemplative, intense emotional involvement with subject. Vanitas paintings, in a philosophical tradition dating from the 17th century, are a confident assertion of life alongside a reminder of its ephemeral nature. In Roy’s case this was expressed through sheep skulls, fruit, vases of flowers, books and rich fabrics. The depiction of mirrors encouraged a questioning of the familiar. He was also concerned with resonances between form, structure and colour. In addition he painted landscape and wrote articles about painting. Born in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, he was the son of Winifred Owen, a former maid at Llanover Hall, where his father, Ivor Powell, had been a gardener. Ivor later became a policeman and, on his retirement and encouraged by Roy, took up painting in a naive style. Roy attended Monmouth school, where its inspirational art teacher, the Polish exile Otto Maciąg, encouraged him, as well as West Monmouth school. Roy was one of a number of outstanding artists who attended Cardiff College of Art in the 1950s, interrupted, in his case, by national service. Although his quiet, reflective personality never particularly suited him to the profession, he taught in schools in the Midlands and London between 1959 and 1974. Then he moved to the mid-Wales town of Brecon to teach at the high school. A well-known figure, he became involved at Brecon Cathedral as a warden. It was in retirement from 1990 that Roy was able to flourish fully as an artist. Although a loyal and longstanding member of the Welsh Group, he also joined what would become the Royal Watercolour Society of Wales. He held numerous shows, including at Brecknock Museum and Art Gallery in 1993, where I was the curator, and, alongside his father’s work, at the National Library of Wales in 1997. Roy had been close friends since art college with Islwyn Watkins and Ivor Davies, and the latter regularly drew him. Roy is survived by his partner of 30 years, Jenni Rule, whom he met during preparations for a production by Brecknock Little theatre. His brother, Geoffrey, predeceased him.",Arts/Art and design,Roy Powell obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/03/roy-powell-obituary
4/4/2022,"BBC bosses have readvertised the job of political editor after being unhappy with the choice of candidates to replace Laura Kuenssberg in one of the most influential roles in British journalism. Following weeks of interviews and an extensive recruitment process, the corporation had produced an all-female shortlist for the role, with ITV News’s Anushka Asthana and Sky News’s Sophy Ridge believed to be the final two candidates. An announcement on which of them would get the job had been expected to coincide with Kuenssberg stepping down last week. Instead, the BBC political correspondent Chris Mason is now the favourite to land the role after bosses quietly began inviting fresh applications for the job. The recruitment page for the role of political editor has been reopened until Tuesday, although there has been no acknowledgement of this from senior staff or formal announcement from the BBC encouraging fresh applications. Mason is widely liked across the BBC but one media industry executive pointed out the BBC could be about to reject “an all-female shortlist of brilliant women” in favour of a man. Reopening applications will allow Mason to send in his CV – but will also make it possible for anyone else to apply and is a public sign that executives are not content with the existing range of candidates. In recent days, there had been speculation that BBC executives were unhappy with the process and were seeking other candidates for the role. Mason did not originally apply for the job, in part because it was seen as a role for a more experienced journalist such as Jon Sopel. However, according to people with knowledge of the recruitment process, in recent days BBC bosses encouraged Mason to apply for the role, a development first reported by the Sunday Times. Mason has been at the BBC for two decades, spending most of his career covering Westminster and becoming a frequent presence on television and radio bulletins. The 41-year-old from Grassington in North Yorkshire hosts the Friday evening show Any Questions? and was a regular on the Brexitcast podcast. His current salary is below the £150,000 threshold that has to be declared publicly. Clearing the way for him to become political editor would enable the BBC to retain a prominent journalist who has been approached repeatedly by other commercial broadcasters such as Times Radio with job offers. However, he has still not been interviewed so any appointment could be some time off – while leaving existing candidates facing the decision of whether to pull out of the recruitment process if they believe the job has been lined up for someone else. Other candidates who applied for the job included the BBC’s Alex Forsyth and the Daily Mirror’s Pippa Crerar. People linked to the role at an early stage included Newsnight’s Lewis Goodall and ITV’s Paul Brand. The appointment will help shape the newsroom under the incoming BBC news boss, Deborah Turness, who has promised to shake up the operation but has still not been able to confirm a departure from her current role as chief executive of ITN. There is concern in the BBC newsroom that the national broadcaster was left behind by ITV when it came to breaking Westminster stories about Downing Street’s lockdown-busting Christmas parties. While ITV News broke story after story, the BBC was left playing catch-up and reliant on leaked footage obtained by its main commercial rival. Further cuts to BBC output are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. Whoever becomes BBC political editor will immediately become one of the most influential and scrutinised journalists in the country. Kuenssberg’s time in the job led to an unprecedented level of discussion of what the role of a BBC political editor should be. One key debate is the extent to which the holder of the position should be trying to break fresh news stories – or whether they should focus on stepping back and providing analysis that assertively concludes who is telling the truth.",News/Media,BBC advertises political editor’s job after dissatisfaction with shortlist,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/03/chris-mason-favourite-to-be-bbc-political-editor-as-job-readvertised
4/4/2022,"Golf fans will have to wait a little while longer to find out whether Tiger Woods will make a surprising return to this month’s Masters. Speculation has been building that Woods will compete at Augusta, where the tournament is due to start on Thursday, after he played a practice round at the course last week. The 15-time major winner has not played professional golf since a serious car crash last year that many believed would end his career. On Sunday, Woods confirmed he was continuing to practice at Augusta but would not make an immediate decision on whether to play at the tournament. “I will be heading up to Augusta today to continue my preparation and practice,” he wrote on Twitter. “It will be a game-time decision on whether I compete. Congratulations to 16-year-old Anna Davis on an amazing win at the @anwagolf and good luck to all the kids in the @DriveChipPutt.” I will be heading up to Augusta today to continue my preparation and practice. It will be a game-time decision on whether I compete. Congratulations to 16-year-old Anna Davis on an amazing win at the @anwagolf and good luck to all the kids in the @DriveChipPutt. Augusta is known as a physically demanding due to its hills and length, and the 46-year-old Woods is likely to test how his body reacts to playing the course over the next few days before making a final decision. Woods sustained serious injuries in last February’s crash, including open fractures of the tibia and fibula in his right leg. “My right leg does not look like my left leg, let’s put it that way,” Woods told reporters earlier this year at the Genesis Invitational. Woods has won the Masters five times and if he plays at this year’s tournament, it will be the second time Augusta has been the venue of a remarkable comeback for the American. In 2019, he returned from a series of back surgeries to win the Masters, his first major since 2008. This year’s tournament is the 25th anniversary of his first Masters victory, when he won by a record 12 shots. The Masters does not have a strict deadline for players to confirm whether they will compete, meaning he could leave his decision as late as Thursday. Other golfers have said they would welcome Woods’s return. “For golf and for the Masters tournament and for everyone, to have Tiger there would be phenomenal. I think it just adds to the event. Obviously, it does,” said Rory McIlroy. “Anything Tiger Woods does in the game of golf is heightened whenever he’s there. I mean, it would be awesome for him to be there.” ",Sport/Sport,Tiger Woods says possible Masters return will be a ‘game-time decision’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/03/tiger-woods-says-possible-masters-return-will-be-a-game-time-decision
4/4/2022,"Britain’s strategic heavy industries have warned they risk being left high and dry by a lack of support in the government’s upcoming energy strategy, warning that failure to follow European countries’ measures to reduce gas and electricity costs will put UK businesses at risk. The government is expected to outline long-awaited proposals this week for a once-in-a-generation drive to invest in nuclear power and possibly more onshore wind and solar power, as well as approving continued North Sea oil and gas exploration. The plan expected to be set out by ministers on Thursday has been delayed amid disagreements in the cabinet about which technologies to back, including a fraught battle over new nuclear power plants, with the Treasury thought to be reluctant to invest large sums in costly projects. One industry source said heavy energy users were “not expecting anything” to help them on gas or electricity, the latter of which can cost up to 60% more than the price paid by European competitors. Earlier this month, Boris Johnson promised measures to “address the needs of British steel, British ceramics and the whole of British industry” but the business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, told MPs last week that the government had already taken steps to support industrial firms facing soaring costs. Against a backdrop of ballooning energy bills for strategically important companies and major manufacturing firms, energy intensive industries told the Guardian that the mixed messages had left them fearing they will receive minimal help, or none at all. Richard Warren, a spokesperson for the trade body UK Steel, said it had “long urged the government to reduce the politically and regulatory controlled elements of electricity bills in line with action taken by governments elsewhere”. Simply renewing a compensation scheme that gives industrial plans a refund on the cost of the UK’s emissions trading scheme, but which expired on Friday, would be only a “partial solution”. UK Steel said the industry “needs full compensation for the costs of carbon in electricity, an increase in the relief on renewables levies, and similar reductions in network costs as already provided by governments in France, Germany, and the Netherlands”. Stephen Elliott, the chief executive of the Chemical Industries Association, warned that prolonged high energy costs could see factories reduce operations or foreign-owned firms take their business elsewhere. “I can’t stand in front of Kwasi Kwarteng and say that businesses will be shutting a week on Thursday, but I can’t say they’ll be viable and running full tilt, either,” he said. “Things are getting tighter as our ability to pass through cost to our customers is becoming increasingly more difficult. “Our continental European competitors are getting more relief [following the EU’s recent crisis framework enabling more state aid in this area]. If we leave it to the moment when a chemical plant shuts, restarting those is a very challenging thing to do from a health and safety perspective responsibly.” Over the weekend, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, rejected calls for the UK to consider rationing energy, as ministers explore ways to boost Britain’s resilience to international shocks to oil gas markets after the Russian invasion of Ukraine led to record increases in costs. Kwarteng told the Sunday Telegraph that nuclear energy and offshore wind turbines would play a bigger role in energy production, with as many as seven new nuclear plants by 2050. Chemicals companies use disproportionately large amounts of electricity in their processes. Inovyn, a chlorine manufacturer that operates from a plant in Runcorn on the banks of the Mersey, uses as much electricity as the nearby city of Liverpool. Elliott warned that some businesses owned by overseas companies might reconsider their investment in the UK if nothing is done about energy prices. “If you were to ask investors in chemicals around the world, there are good reasons for coming to the UK, but the negative factor has always been energy costs. So UK sites of foreign parents are always marked down on that front and will increasingly be so. Please don’t leave it until we are shutting, because by then it’s probably too late.” Elliott wrote to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in March calling for greater support for UK companies to pay carbon emissions costs, pointing to measures taken by European countries. The Guardian has approached the government’s business department for comment.",News/Business,High energy-using industries fear lack of support from UK ministers ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/03/high-energy-using-industries-fear-lack-of-support-from-uk-ministers
4/4/2022,"At a time of steep rise in Covid infections, with one in 20 people in England testing positive in recent weeks and hospital admissions going up, William Hanage is right to remind us all that measures in addition to vaccination have a vital role to play (From ‘herd immunity’ to today, Covid minimisers are still sabotaging our pandemic progress, 29 March). Unfortunately, the government is in denial about this and has withdrawn free lateral flow tests for most people, while also reducing funding for community surveillance studies. This is part of a dangerous narrative from the prime minister that we got the big calls right. Tell that to the relatives of the 175,000 who have died. Wearing masks and providing clean air inside buildings are important public health measures. As Hanage points out, the scourge of epidemic cholera and typhoid was not removed by giving individuals personal responsibility for protecting themselves against enteric fevers, but through clean water and effective sewerage. A “head in the sand” approach has deadly consequences. While aerosol spread is now widely recognised as the principal mode of Covid transmission, it is astonishing that government guidance still means health and care workers are not being provided with the protection they need.Dr John PuntisCo-chair, Keep Our NHS Public  William Hanage highlights several measures to blunt future waves of Covid-19. But these will be inadequate without the direct involvement of local communities. A community-centred approach is crucial to disseminating public health messages relating to Covid. Mobilising community participation will be vital to support mutual aid groups in neighbourhoods, provide resources to voluntary groups, and work through existing neighbourhood networks. Working with informal leaders in communities can assist the continued uptake of vaccines. Ensuring more diverse forms of communication about Covid-19 is also vital. Current methods are overreliant on access to the internet (which many individuals and groups may not have) as a medium for transmitting public health messages. Non-digital approaches are equally important, eg leaflets through doors, advertising in shops and local newspapers and work with faith-based organisations. Covid hit some communities far worse than others, and living with Covid is likely to perpetuate such inequalities. Doing something about Covid must involve embedding community-based approaches as a key part of any pandemic strategy.Chris PhillipsonProfessor of sociology and social gerontology, University of Manchester  Frances Ryan is right to regard the end of free Covid tests as “an act of national sabotage” (31 March). She mentions the burden this places on, among others, those who wish to check that they are not asymptomatically infected before visiting vulnerable loved ones. But, like the government, she makes no mention of those of us who are living with vulnerable loved ones. My wife is immunosuppressed and among those recognised as eligible for free tests and for urgent anti-viral treatment in the event of a positive test. But I who share a home – bed, meals, kitchen and bathroom – with her am not even advised to test myself to ensure that I can safely do so without risk to my wife.Hartley DeanSt Albans, Hertfordshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/4/2022,"To describe the record of the academy schools programme as “patchy”, as your print headline did, is a gross understatement (Editorial, 29 March). The rapid expansion of academies since 2010, on the whim of an ignorant education secretary, has led to vast sums of public money being thrown at a system that has failed to raise standards while being repeatedly mired in scandals. The most recent report of the cross-party public accounts committee (PAC) complains of “tens of millions of public money used to ‘prop up’ poorly managed academy schools” in a system that lacks financial transparency and is unaccountable to parents and the local community. Similar complaints have been repeatedly made by the PAC since 2010, and investigative journalists have repeatedly exposed the murky governance and dubious financial behaviour of academy trusts. An outstanding example of the latter from 2018 is on the Guardian’s own website. Schools and councils may indeed be worn out by repeatedly fighting the government’s agenda, but their resistance might have been strengthened had there been any worthwhile political opposition.Michael PykeCampaign for State Education  Re your article (Plans for England’s schools include national behaviour survey, 28 march), the education targets set out in the government’s white paper are unrealistic if we continue to overlook the importance of early years education. We cannot expect primary school children to achieve ambitious results in key stage 2 reading, writing and maths if they are not given the right support in their pre-school years. A recent survey of teachers by the Early Years Alliance found that 50% of reception-age children are not ready to start school. By the time children reach the age of five, disadvantaged pupils are already more than four months behind their better-off peers when it comes to educational development. It’s a gap that will persist throughout their schooling. Without an associated early years strategy, these new targets place a disproportionate strain on overworked primary school teachers and won’t get the results ministers are looking for.Brett WigdortzCEO, Tiney, and founder, Teach First  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

While it is probably easier to lose hair as a man than as a woman, many men find going bald unpleasant, even traumatising, especially when hair loss occurs at a young age. Premature baldness in men has been linked to depression and anxiety. This was certainly my experience when my hair suddenly began thinning at the age of 18. My self-esteem suffered, I was bullied and dating became difficult.

4/4/2022,"The women in Patrick Demarchelier’s photographs seem to be leading their best lives. Celebrities, stars, supermodels, his royal client Diana, Princess of Wales, are often caught in those moments of easeful perfection after hair and makeup prep is over, when they have been slathered with flattery, are camera-ready, but not yet self-conscious before the lens. The session has not passed from fun to work. Sitters described him as charming, always complimenting them with the never-lost strong French accent (his impenetrable Frenglish had to be subtitled for a fashion documentary). Demarchelier, who has died aged 78, came to fashion in Paris in the late 1960s, among a group of young photographers sharing a new informality. They preferred street snaps to studio shots, and unexotic young models sans sulks, visibly having a good time in places magazine readers could understand – a sunny beach, a market. The women also interacted with each other, whereas from the 40s to the mid-60s a model was usually isolated, alone on a page. Demarchelier did not pursue his confreres’ full reportage style, but transposed their “lucky paparazzi catching a spontaneous moment” quality over to portraits of the beautiful famous: he believed the perfect picture was a “half-second accident”. To catch it he worked pretty fast, especially in the era of small crews up to the late 90s, and could always be relied on to deliver a sellable cover to the newsstand. When the editor of US Vogue in the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada checks he has been booked, everybody understands that she means: “I want this tricky job with a diva delivered now, with no drama.” William Blake’s “Damn braces, bless relaxes” was the principle of his best covers. He took a few desultory frames of the teenage Christy Turlington lolling mussed after a day of many outfit changes in a Mexican resort, and voilà, a great cover, Vogue 1989. The same year, he popped his young son Victor inside the huge towelling robe that Vanessa Duve was wearing on a beach, and caught them wind-ruffled and laughing together, another cover. Diana saw and liked it so much, the boy close in age to her sons, that she asked Demarchelier for a private portrait session. He brought in the stylist Sam McKnight to chop-snip her hair like model Linda Evangelista’s, albeit with a tiara atop, and reassured unconfident Diana of her glamour; both were rewarded with memorable images that used supermodel visual language. Twenty years before, Norman Parkinson had produced a fine Vogue cover of Princess Anne in romantic fashions in the tradition of her royal mother and grandmother, but the Demarchelier-Diana collaboration was novel; it helped establish Diana as a celebrity independent of the Windsor family firm. Her friend, then UK Vogue editor, Liz Tilberis, requested Palace permission to reproduce one picture as a cover, and commissioned fresh sequences. Demarchelier was anything but to a high style born, one of five sons of a half-French, half-English mother and a father frequently away with a travelling cinema, who then left permanently for Africa. The family crowded in with relatives in industrial Le Havre, Normandy, and the boy was a layabout at school, always taking pictures with his eyes, in brilliant light (his oeuvre, indoors and out, is brightly lit). His mother divorced and remarried, and when he was 17 his stepfather gave him a simple Kodak, with which he did portraits and wedding shots for small fees, finding a job as a lab retoucher and printer of passport pictures. His sole aim was to make it to Paris, which he did at 20, earning a living as a printer of news pictures. Demarchelier became house photographer to a Paris model agency, then assistant to Hans Feurer, already shooting in the new mode, ready-to-wear clothes on non-soignée models, for the lively young magazines Elle, Marie Claire and Nova. Feurer saw clothes first, Demarchelier regarded every assignment as a portrait-of-a-character job, leaving the garments to the choice and arrangement of the fashion editor and stylists; even in his mighty Rizzoli book, Dior Couture (2011), the models triumph over their fabulous garb. That approach paid off slowly: Condé Nast’s editorial director Alex Lieberman recruited him to the magazine empire in the 70s, but his success really grew in the 80s, when movie and music business stars, and supermodels who became celebrities themselves, brought their names and huge personalities into editorial and ad pictures. Demarchelier’s contract allowed him to do both kinds of work, including ad campaigns for Dior, Chanel, Armani and Ralph Lauren, and that privilege continued when in 1992 Tilberis moved to the Hearst Corporation in New York, to edit Harpers, and demanded as part of her deal that Hearst pay the high price of appointing Demarchelier as lead photographer. The corporation got good value as he also provided covers and editorial for Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire, Oprah Winfrey’s magazine O, and Esquire. Condé Nast had to offer him seven figures to return in 2004, by when his Manhattan studio had expanded to three floors and a long pay-roll, although he remained nostalgic for his NY beginnings in 1974, just him and the cameras, managing his own lights. Despite some starry male portraits, this big equipage all depended on Demarchelier’s relationship with female subjects, including most of the Oscar red-carpet A-list plus Madonna, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, Céline Dion and Janet Jackson, whom he shot discreetly topless for Rolling Stone. Demarchelier said he did not like women who were exhibitionists, but over the decades his frank delight in close proximity to women persuaded many sitters into at least a flash of cleavage and sometimes nudity. Then in 2018 a Boston Globe investigation reported that this much-professed rapport had been predatory over the years, with seven women, including an assistant, alleging unwanted advances by Demarchelier. He denied the accusations, but Condé Nast immediately announced that he would not work for it again. He met Mia Skoog when she was modelling on a Vogue shoot, and they married early on in his career with the magazine. She and their sons, Gustaf, Arthur and Victor, survive him.

4/4/2022,"The good news for Everton is that five of the 10 games they have remaining this season are at home. The bad news is that their buffer over the relegation zone is just three points and their away form remains as bad as ever. Five games on the road since Frank Lampard took over have brought five defeats – and what makes this one worse is how unnecessary and self-inflicted it felt. There was a time when Frank Lampard would turn up at West Ham and be greeted with implacable hostility. There’d be jeers, cries of Judas and taunts based on his round-faced appearance. Not any more. There were boos before kick-off, but they came largely from the away fans and were directed at Kurt Zouma. For Lampard there was nothing. At one point he wandered to the edge of the pitch to kick a ball back into the warm-up and seemed to pause, as though in anticipation of the abuse. But it never came. If indifference is the true opposite of love, of course, it made sense. What West Ham fan did not look at his performances for Chelsea and wish he had been scoring those goals in claret and blue? But what West Ham fan would look at Lampard’s time as a manager and wish it were he, rather than David Moyes, standing in their technical area? They are the ones awaiting a European quarter-final; he is the one in a relegation battle. They have, perhaps, belatedly, moved on. Even the round cheeks have gone, worn down by the cares of time. The longer he stays at Everton the less likely they are to return. This always looked a brutally tough job. Managers from Sam Allardyce to Carlo Ancelotti, Marco Silva to Rafa Benítez, have struggled with it. Nobody, really, has done it well since Moyes left in 2013. If a pattern has been discernible in their transfers since Farhad Moshiri took over the club, it has only been that they have repeatedly paid too much for players on the way down. The financial results released last week offered only cause for concern. The pandemic may be in part to blame for losses of £120.9m, but they were incurred despite record turnover, while the wage-to-turnover ratio reached a surely unsustainable 95%. With the club forced to sever its ties with the sanctioned oligarch Alisher Usmanov and major expenditure to come on the move to the new stadium, it’s hard to see anything but retrenchment in the near future even if they stay up – and if they do so, it will not be because of their away form. To say that Lampard’s problem at Chelsea was an inability to organise his defence is not quite true. There was that run of nine games in the autumn of 2020 in which his side conceded only two goals. The problem was that there were three 0-0s in that run. He could organise a defence; the issue was organising a team that had the balance also to attack. There was no sign here of bowing to circumstance. Everton may have leaked 14 goals in four away games under Lampard, but there was no adopting a safety-first approach and accepting that keeping things tight might be the better part of valour. Rather Lampard went with a 4-1-4-1 that would have looked even more attacking than it did had Donny van de Beek not pulled up in the warm-up to be replaced by Mason Holgate. The result was that even in a largely soporific first half this weary West Ham, whose focus has understandably shifted to the Europa League tie against Lyon, cut through them pretty much every time they were able to muster the energy to try. The opening goal arrived after 31 minutes, a free-kick swept into the top corner by the former Liverpool youth player Aaron Cresswell. Some West Ham laxity then invited Everton into the game. culminating in Holgate levelling with a deflected effort following a corner. Assuming the goal is credited to him, he becomes the first Everton player to score an away goal under Lampard (his own goal at Newcastle meant he was already the first player to score against Lampard’s Everton away from Goodison). But the sloppiness was catching and, just six minutes after Everton had pulled level, Alex Iwobi’s miscontrol allowed West Ham to restore their lead, Jarrod Bowen clipping in the rebound after Jordan Pickford had denied Michail Antonio. That was bad enough, but Michael Keane, already booked, then lunged into Antonio to collect a second yellow. And with that the game was done. The positive for Everton was that this probably was their least bad away performance under Lampard, but they were still beaten easily enough by opponents who rarely seemed to be playing much above half-pace.",Sport/Football,Jarrod Bowen winner sees West Ham to deserved victory over 10-man Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/03/west-ham-everton-premier-league-match-report
