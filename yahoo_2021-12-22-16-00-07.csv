12/22/2021,"Black Girls Code founder Kimberly Bryant has been removed from leading the nonprofit. In a statement, the nonprofit's board said it's investigating allegations of ""workplace impropriety,"" but Bryant remains on staff. Black Girls Code teaches girls tech skills, and has partnered with Google, Facebook, and Nike. Kimberly Bryant, the founder of Black Girls Code, has been removed as head of the nonprofit by its board.

""Press release: so it's 3 days before Christmas and you wake up to discover the organization YOU created and built from the ground up has been taken away by a rogue board with no notification,"" Bryant tweeted. In an emailed statement to Insider, Black Girls Code's board said that Bryant remains on the company's staff while ""serious allegations of workplace impropriety are being investigated."" It said it had appointed an interim executive director to manage the nonprofit.

Bryant did not respond to a request for comment from Insider. She had tweeted earlier that she was preparing a formal statement.

Bryant, an engineer who previously worked in pharmaceuticals and biotech, founded Black Girls Code in 2011. The nonprofit runs workshops, summer camps, and other programs for girls to learn technology skills in areas such as web design, app development, and robotics. In 2016, Insider named Bryant one of the most powerful female engineers of that year.

Based in Oakland, California, the nonprofit has chapters in 16 cities and its programming has reached more than 30,000 participants.

Black Girls Code has amassed support from companies such as Google, Facebook, IBM, and Nike. Its board, which the nonprofit first announced in 2018, includes prominent Black leaders in technology and entrepreneurship. Among its directors are Stacy Brown-Philpot, the former CEO of TaskRabbit and a member of the SoftBank Oppportunity Fund's investment committee; Sherman Whites, a director at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, a nonprofit that supports entrepreneurship; and Heather Hiles, the founder of ed-tech company Pathbrite and the managing director of the venture firm Black Ops VC.

Bryant's tweets drew an outpouring of support and sympathy from many in the tech community who expressed shock at the news of her removal from the nonprofit's leadership.

""This is an unfathomable mess handled in the most unjust way humanly possible to a woman who was a huge part of building this movement,"" wrote Karla Monterroso, the former CEO of Code2040, a nonprofit focused on racial equity in the tech industry.
