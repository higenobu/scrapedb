12/29/2021,"Sajid Javid has criticised the Welsh government for banning parkrun as a measure to control the spread of Covid. The health secretary tweeted: “Parkrun has helped so many people improve their health across the UK. I can’t see how restricting outdoor exercise in this way is justified or proportionate.”  Since 26 December, all outdoor gatherings of 50 or more adults have been prohibited in Wales. The rule has put a temporary stop to Welsh parkruns – free, weekly 5km runs that take place across the world every Saturday at 9am. Junior parkruns, which are for children aged four to 14, can continue. “We know that some Welsh parkrun events regularly have fewer than 50 people attending, however it would take a very small influx (at what is typically a very busy time of year) for them to exceed the limit,” parkrun said in a statement. “We understand that this news will be incredibly disappointing to many Welsh parkrunners, and we’d like to reassure you all that we will do everything we can to bring parkrun events back across Wales as soon as these restrictions are lifted.” The former communities secretary Robert Jenrick called the Welsh decision “madness”. “Having worked with councils to restart parkrun in England this summer, it would be madness to stop it again in Wales or elsewhere. It’s outdoors, and quite obviously brings huge health benefits,” he tweeted. The Welsh Athletics boss James Williams also called on Wales’s government to reconsider the move. “Of all the activities that can’t take place, sadly the one that probably provides the biggest health benefit to everyone across Wales is the one activity that sadly has to stop,” he told the BBC Radio Wales Breakfast programme. Researchers earlier this month estimated UK parkrun generated at least £150m in health and wellbeing impact each year. Parkruns can go ahead in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland as usual.",News/Society,Sajid Javid criticises Welsh government for banning parkrun,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/29/sajid-javid-criticises-welsh-government-banning-parkrun

12/29/2021,"Iam in the pub. It is dark, loud and at full capacity. Sitting with a group of people, my mind drifts towards something funny that happened at work. I wonder if it is funny enough to repeat and, if so, how it would sound if I were to say it out loud. I mouth the story to myself, word by word, trying out different intonations. Further inane questions skip through my mind. How do I start the story? Do I provide dialogue? Do I do voices? Under the table, my hands rehearse the accompanying gestures. Just as I am about to speak, I sense an ambient dread rising up, like reflux. I blush and the conversation moves on.  I am not always this anxious on a night out – jokes sometimes land, ripping yarns are occasionally told – but I would love to be able to tell a simple story without enduring all … this. Although it has never been clear exactly what “this” is, a pattern has emerged over the years: talking, to a number of people, usually in a loud or public setting, isn’t easy for me. It could be social phobia, or stage fright; perhaps a bit of both. Whatever it is, I want it to stop. With this in mind, I did something people like me rarely do and signed up for an improv class. I soon found myself alongside six people in a well-lit room inside the Irish Centre in Camden, north London, one Thursday evening, ready to be cured. There is a sizeable industry dedicated to helping (or making a few quid) people like me: TedX Talks; apps such as Speeko; toastmaster courses. I chose improv because it’s real – you can’t stage something that literally takes place on the stage – but also because it has been around for ever. From the Italian Commedia dell’arte to the House of Commons, the ability to think and perform on your feet, script-free, is a skill that can lead to greatness. And who doesn’t want to be great? The Free Association is the UK’s largest improv theatre group. Founded in 2015, the FA now trains several thousand students a year in rooms above pubs in north-east London. There is a syllabus and a handbook; students have to learn the fundamentals in order to graduate from one level to the next – there are five in total – performing as they go. Many go on to form groups and perform at ticketed events. Sitting with the others in a circle, I notice the room is rigged for activity: bottles of water, open windows (because it gets hot), everyone in practical shoes. The attenders, aged between 20 and 50, make small talk and I soon feel that familiar dread. I try to think about the worst that could happen (shame?), but, alas, terror doesn’t care for logic. I want to leave. The host, Scott, has us warm up with physical bonding exercises: Vroom, Screech (where we pretend to be cars – funnier than it sounds); a mnemonic game (Memory, but with mimes); and my favourite, the Story Game, where players bat single words between them to tell a tale. Ours involves a llama, deep societal poverty and a Saw-like death using a corkscrew. Water is drunk; more windows are opened. We are then paired up to play “Yes, and”, a call-and-response activity designed to help build scenes. Pointing at random objects in the room, my partner and I riff off each other. “The chair is blue,” she shouts. “Yes, and it’s ugly,” I cry out. The bedrock of improv, “Yes, and” prevents you from stalling in a scene, but it also encourages you to talk. In life, the loudest hog the floor; with “Yes, and”, you have no choice but to speak. Scott started doing improv after Wikipedia-ing his favourite comedians to see how they started out. While he now performs on stage, he credits improv with providing him with “a general fuck-it-ness approach” to life. “I’ll be shy until the day I die, but improvising has this strange way of making me less scared of the world,” he says. “Like, I don’t know what’s going to happen, but what’s the worst that can happen?” Successful improv sketches hinge on a kind of telepathy among players, but at our level the key is “active listening”. Rather than waiting for your turn to talk, you pay attention, make eye contact and forget that it is your turn until it is. Translated to real life, it is a bit pie-in-the-sky (you can’t surround yourself with excellent listeners), but it is a good reminder that the problem is not always you. I am not sure when I started struggling to talk in front of groups, but I usually chalk it down to a few difficult moments I would rather forget. The time at university when I appeared in a Pinter play and ruined a key pause with the sound of my prop flapping loudly and nervously in my hand. The time I was celebrating my 10th birthday over pizza and became so overwhelmed by the attention that I had to run to the loo to throw up. Or even the time last year when I tripped spectacularly over my words while trying to explain to my in-laws what it is I do for a living. The situation changes, but the anxiety remains: boring but pervasive. Over the years, I have tried to investigate it, but to little effect. I used to have a stammer, but I grew out of that in my teens. I definitely mumble, but have sharpened my diction over the years. Clearing out my childhood home last year, I found a picture of a tiger with the words “I’m scared so mush of the world” written inside a speech bubble, drawn when I was six. My therapist thinks I was born cursed. The only thing I hate more than talking in front of an audience is people who do it well – so it is remarkable that I would have a baby with one of those people. But while I begrudge the ease with which my boyfriend can discuss big pharma on Canadian radio (he, too, is a journalist), it is the everyday stuff that really pains me. The sparkling small talk at soft play; the dinner-table gags; his ability to recount mundane details of his everyday life in a pub without fear of friends switching off, or his disregard if they do. Perhaps the answer is this – not caring. Like avant garde theatre, improv follows the tenet that performing in order to entertain your audience is a lowering of one’s artistic standards. It is about what happens on stage – and to hell with who’s listening. This so-called “fuck-it-ness”. The class is wrapping up. It is only when Scott congratulates us for turning up that I realise everyone is actually like me. Some are even worse. The woman to my left joined because she wants to be a comedy writer, but the one next to her joined because she is “crap at public speaking”. On the one hand, improv is the basis of the modern US comedy landscape, but in a society that considers it a moral virtue to be able to communicate in public, improv also has a 12-step side to it. People come to be healed. The final piece is performed on stage. Standing in threes, we play the one-word game as if – stay with me here – we were a “three-headed wild-swimming nun”, answering audience questions about our favourite stroke, or how we have aligned our faith with cold-water swimming. Five hysterical minutes later, I return to my seat, stunned that I survived, yet barely able to remember what happened. Most baffling of all, I am sad to no longer be on the stage. The following week, at a friend’s gallery opening, I start telling a story about a train journey. Slowly, people gather. I still sweat and trip over words, but ultimately finish the tale – not quite healed, but without dying in the process.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Escape your comfort zone: I have a mortal, lifelong fear of public speaking.

12/29/2021,"For Paul Bowles, the Sahara was “one of the last great terrae incognitae left on this shrinking planet”. His 1949 novel The Sheltering Sky was inspired by the desert’s “intensely poetic” dunes and in a later essay he described its impact on him: “In this wholly mineral landscape lighted by stars like flares, even memory disappears; nothing is left but your own breathing and the sound of your heart beating … For no one who has stayed in the Sahara for a while is quite the same as when he came.” The Sahara is vast, covering about a third of the continent of Africa. From the Atlantic to the Red Sea it sprawls across 4,800km, and from its southern to its northern limit is a distance of some 1,800km . It is, said Bowles, “a continent within a continent”, with its own mountain ranges, plains, dunes, valleys and volcanic craters. And yet its lakes are made of salt and its forests are no longer alive but petrified fossils. For most of this lunar landscape is without vegetation or even soil. He found the experience like travelling to another planet: “Not a blade of grass for hundreds of miles. Stark black hills rising from endless plains with a thin surface layer of fine gravel. Great humpbacked sand dunes aligned in seemingly endless rows parallel to the wind. Sand, dust, and wind; wind, dust, and sand.”  But it has not always been like this. Martin Williams, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Adelaide, has seen for himself how, on rock faces deep in the desert, prehistoric artists had scratched or painted evocative scenes of long-lost people herding cattle, as well as images of giraffes and elephants. He helped excavate the oldest complete domestic cow skeleton ever found in the Sahara, a relic from 5,000 years ago. The bones were stumbled upon during an early morning walk at the isolated mountain of Adrar Bous which, he notes, is “about as far inland as it is possible to be in north Africa, which is one reason why it is so dry”. This, together with the discovery of Neolithic pottery and tools, proved that farmers and herders were living in that area 5,000 years ago. According to Williams, “the stark contrast between present aridity and the overwhelming evidence of a recently wetter past has led me on a lifelong journey”. Williams’s book is the fruit of that journey. The general reader may find it technical in parts, but it is a detailed and authoritative account that reveals the rich and fascinating story of this unique landscape and its climate, geology and natural history. The Sahara began to dry out some 7m years ago, principally due to the slow drift of the continent of Africa into latitudes characterised by drier air. Rain-bearing clouds shed their moisture before they could get to it. “The Sahara existed as a desert millions of years before humans ever appeared on the scene,” writes Williams. But on a number of occasions the Sahara has been a green and pleasant land. The last time was between 15,000 and 5,000 years ago. Back then, the tropics received more radiation from the sun, and summer and winter rains reached into the heart of this now barren land. Vegetation belts in the north and the south spread more than 1,000km farther inland than their current limits. It was a land of tropical savannah and grassland, with lakes and rivers filled with an abundance of life. But from about 5,000 years ago the Sahara began to dry out again. Williams rejects theories that early humans were the principal cause of this, due to deforestation and overgrazing: “The Sahara is dry today for good and sufficient geographical reasons that have nothing to do with humans.” In answer to the question of whether the Sahara will one day be green again he replies: “Yes, but not for a long time to come.” Williams admires those who continue to live in the Sahara for their deep understanding of nature and ability to survive in such a harsh environment. He describes how on one journey they needed to drink from a muddy pool. When he offered to filter the mud using his shirt, their “aristocratic young Tuareg guide curled his lips in scorn and dispatched his younger brother with a small axe to obtain some pieces of bark from a particular tree”. Added to a calabash of the muddy water, the bark caused the organic matter to settle within minutes, leaving the liquid crystal-clear. Williams’s book offers a wonderful insight into how climate can transform the landscape across long stretches of time, as well as how delicately balanced are the ecosystems on which we depend. All the more reason, Williams writes, to “cherish the wisdom of past peoples who learned to live in greater harmony with their land than many of us have presently managed”.

12/29/2021,"Air travel in and out of the UK slumped by 71% in 2021 as the second year of the Covid-19 crisis took its toll on international flying, according to a report. Just over 406,000 international flights operated from the UK this year compared with almost 1.4m in 2019 before the pandemic struck and travel restrictions were imposed, said the aviation analytics firm Cirium in research reported by the BBC. UK domestic flights were found to have declined by almost 60%.  The budget carrier Ryanair remained the largest airline in the UK, Cirium said, operating more than 100,000 UK flights in 2021, followed by easyJet, with more than 82,000 flights in total. The busiest international route was between London’s Heathrow and New York’s JFK, even though the US only reopened its borders to UK travellers in November. Travellers from the US had been able to fly to the UK since 28 July. Short-haul flights were the most popular, though, with eight out of the 10 busiest routes to mainland Europe. They included London Heathrow to Amsterdam, Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt. The UK’s busiest domestic route was the 31-mile flight between Land’s End to St Mary’s on the Isles of Scilly, with 2,330 one-way flights recorded this year. With new Covid infections soaring across Europe and the US, and hitting record highs in the UK amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, the outlook for next year remains uncertain. Thousands of flights have been cancelled over the past few days because of staff testing positive for Covid-19, and bad weather in parts of the US. By Wednesday morning, a further 2,100 flights had been cancelled globally, after 3,000 cancellations on Tuesday, including 1,300 into or out of the US, according to the tracking website FlightAware. Globally, airlines cancelled more than 6,000 flights between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day, normally the busiest time of the year. Separately, Indonesia has lifted the ban on the Boeing 737 Max, more than three years after a Lion Air plane flying from Jakarta crashed in October 2018, killing 189 people. In March 2019, there was a second disaster involving the 737 Max model when an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed soon after takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing 157 people. Boeing’s bestselling aircraft was then grounded globally.
