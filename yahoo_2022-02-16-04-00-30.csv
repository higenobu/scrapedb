2/16/2022,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A series of cyberattacks on Tuesday knocked the websites of Ukrainian government offices and major banks offline, Ukrainian authorities said, attacks that came amid strong tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine. It was too early to know, however, if the apparently low-level denial-of-service attacks might be a smokescreen for more serious and damaging cyber mischief. Escalating fears about a Russian invasion of Ukraine eased slightly as Russia sent signals Tuesday that it might be pulling back from the brink, but Western powers demanded proof. At least 10 Ukrainian websites were unreachable due to denial-of-service attacks, including those of the Defense Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, the Culture Ministry and Ukraine’s two largest state banks. In such attacks, websites are barraged with a flood of junk data packets, rendering them unreachable. Customers at Ukraine’s largest state-owned bank, Privatbank, and the state-owned Sberbank reported problems with online payments and the banks’ apps. “There is no threat to depositors’ funds,"" the Ukrainian Information Ministry’s Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security said in a statement. The deputy minister, Victor Zhora, confirmed the cyberattacks. The ministry suggested Russia could be behind Tuesday’s incident, without providing details. “It is possible that the aggressor resorted to tactics of petty mischief, because his aggressive plans aren’t working overall,” the statement said. Oleh Derevianko, a leading private sector expert and founder of the ISSP cybersecurity firm, said it was not immediately clear if Tuesday's cyberattacks were limited to a denial-of-service campaign. “That’s exactly the question we always ask,” he said. Ukraine has been subject to a steady diet of Russian aggression in cyberspace since 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The attacks follow a Jan. 14 cyberattack that damaged servers at Ukraine's State Emergency Service and at the Motor Transport Insurance Bureau with a malicious “wiper” cloaked as ransomware. The damage proved minimal — some cybersecurity experts think that was by design, given the capabilities of Russian state-backed hackers. A message posted simultaneously on dozens of defaced Ukrainian government websites said: “Be afraid and expect the worst.” Serhii Demediuk, the No. 2 official at Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, called the attack Tuesday “part of a full-scale Russian operation directed at destabilizing the situation in Ukraine, aimed at exploding our Euro-Atlantic integration and seizing power.” Such attacks are apt to continue as Russian President Vladimir Putin tries to “degrade” and “delegitimize” trust in Ukrainian institutions, the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said in a blog post. Ukraine has been the premier testing ground of cyberconflict. In the winters of 2015 and 2016, attacks on Ukraine's power grid attributed to Russia's GRU military intelligence agency temporarily knocked out power. Russia's GRU has also been blamed for perhaps the most devastating cyberattack ever. Targeting companies doing business in Ukraine in 2017, the NotPetya virus caused over $10 billion in damage worldwide. The virus, also disguised as ransomware, was a “wiper” virus that scrubbed entire networks. ___ Follow all AP stories on tensions over Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",World/Associated Press,"Cyberattacks hit Ukrainian government sites, major banks",https://news.yahoo.com/cyberattack-hits-ukrainian-government-sites-175124095.html

2/16/2022,"Social media users in China are blasting Chinese American figure skating star Nathan Chen, with many calling him a “traitor” for representing the United States at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.

Chen drew heavy criticism on Chinese social media platform Weibo after winning his first Olympic gold medal in the individual figure skating program and helping the U.S. team secure the silver medal in the team figure skating competition last week, reported Yahoo Sports.

Many Chinese fans unfavorably compared Chen to U.S. born athletes competing for Team China at the Winter Olympics, such as 18-year-old freestyle skier Eileen Gu and 19-year-old figure skater Zhu Yi.

Weibo users berated the 22-year-old athlete for his performance, with some calling his finals routine the “acrobatics of a circus monkey,” according to South China Morning Post.

Other users deemed Chen as “too white” and “Americanized” while also accusing him of “insulting China” due to his previous actions, reported CNN. Fans expressed their disappointment after Chen refused to speak in Mandarin during a recent post-game interview and claimed his command of the language “isn’t very good.”

Others noted how the athlete seemingly voiced his support for American ice dancer Evan Bates, who criticized Beijing for its alleged “awful” treatment of the Uyghur people during an interview late last year.

Chen also received online hate on Chinese social media back in 2018 following a performance at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in which he used a song from “Mao’s Last Dancer,” a movie about a dancer who defected to the United States from China in the 1980s
 
Chen revealed in a recent interview that his choreographer chose the song, and Chen himself did not know anything about the film prior to his routine.

“Maybe naively, I didn’t understand the whole system, the whole story behind it, just that the music was very beautiful,” he shared.

According to Chen, his lack of access to social media in China has shielded him from online backlash.

Highlighting the significance of Beijing in his life, Chen shared, “It means the world to be able to be here. My mom grew up in Beijing… And of course, my dad spent a lot of time in Beijing as well.”

Zhu has been subjected to similar criticism on Chinese social media despite choosing to represent Team China, as NextShark previously reported.

While Zhu moved from California to Beijing and renounced her U.S. citizenship to represent China at the Olympics, many still called her “too American” for not being fluent in Mandarin.

Zhu was also heavily mocked online for falling twice during her routine in the women’s single free skating event, thereby causing China to drop from third to fifth place in the team event. She has been told to “go back to America” for reportedly bringing “shame” to China.

Chinese users have a completely different view of Gu, who won gold for China in the women’s big air competition. She is beloved and widely praised on Chinese social media platforms for her success in her sport, budding modeling career, frequent and fluent use of Mandarin and stance on certain political issues.

Unlike Chen, Gu has so far avoided commenting on China’s alleged human rights issues in interviews. And while her defense of China’s internet censorship may have earned criticism on Twitter and Instagram, it appears to have endeared her to many Chinese fans.

2/16/2022,"A mysterious creature that escaped from a Pennsylvania rehabilitation center has been identified, but the location of the four-legged animal remains unknown. Nearly a month after the animal — believed to be either a dog or coyote — was found in freezing temperatures outside a woman’s home, it has officially been identified as a coyote, Wildlife Works in Mount Pleasant said on Monday, Feb. 14. DNA sampling was done to properly identify the creature. But before those tests came back, the animal escaped in late January from the wildlife organization when it destroyed its cage, trashed the hospital area and left scratches on the walls, McClatchy News reported. It fled through a window in the center by chewing through the seal. “Still no sightings, though, thinking he is long gone,” wildlife rehabilitator Morgan Barron told TribLive.com. Barron initially believed the animal was a dog because of its timid and nonaggressive actions, McClatchy News reported. She said in an interview with TribLive the coyote became more defensive in the days that led to its escape. Christina Eyth found the animal outside her Fairfield Township home in mid-January and she kept the animal in her basement as it was “freezing... skittish and scared,” she said, according to McClatchy News. After a rescue organization was called to the home, Wildlife Works eventually stepped in to help identify and care for the creature. They said DNA results identified it as a coyote on Monday.

2/16/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. intelligence officials on Tuesday accused a conservative financial news website with a significant American readership of amplifying Kremlin propaganda and alleged five media outlets targeting Ukrainians have taken direction from Russian spies. The officials said Zero Hedge, which has 1.2 million Twitter followers, published articles created by Moscow-controlled media that were then shared by outlets and people unaware of their nexus to Russian intelligence. The officials did not say whether they thought Zero Hedge knew of any links to spy agencies and did not allege direct links between the website and Russia. Zero Hedge denied the claims and said it tries to “publish a wide spectrum of views that cover both sides of a given story.” In a response posted online Tuesday morning, the website said it “has never worked, collaborated or cooperated with Russia, nor are there any links to spy agencies.” The officials briefed The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence sources. It was the latest effort by President Joe Biden's administration to release U.S. intelligence findings about Russian activity involving Ukraine as part of a concerted push to expose and influence the moves of Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. officials previously accused Putin of planning a “false-flag” operation to create a pretext for a new invasion of Ukraine and detailed what they believe are final-stage Russian preparations for an assault. It’s unclear whether U.S. efforts are changing Putin’s behavior. And without releasing more proof of its findings, Washington has been criticized and reminded of past intelligence failures such as the debunked allegations that pre-war Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Zero Hedge has been sharply critical of Biden and posted stories about allegations of wrongdoing by his son Hunter. While perhaps best known for its coverage of markets and finance, the website also covers politics with a conservative bent. In its response online, the website accused the AP of publishing a “bizarre hit piece” and said government officials were trying to distract from “our views of the current dismal US economic situation."" “The bottom line is that such hit piece accusations that we somehow work with or for the Kremlin are nothing new: we have repeatedly faced similar allegations over the years, and we can absolutely confirm that all of them are ‘errors,’” the website said. In recent months, Zero Hedge has published numerous articles that accused the U.S. of fomenting panic about Ukraine, which now faces the possibility of an invasion by more than 130,000 Russian troops massed on several sides of the country. Some of those articles are listed as being written by people affiliated with the Strategic Culture Foundation. The Biden administration sanctioned the foundation last year for allegedly taking part in Russia’s interference in the 2020 U.S. election. U.S. intelligence officials allege the foundation's leaders ultimately take direction from the SVR, the Russian foreign intelligence service. Recent articles listed as authored by the foundation and published by Zero Hedge include those with the headlines: ""NATO Sliding Towards War Against Russia In Ukraine,” “Americans Need A Conspiracy Theory They Can All Agree On"" and “Theater Of Absurd... Pentagon Demands Russia Explain Troops On Russian Soil."" In an email sent prior to its online response, the website said there “is no relationship between Strategic Cultural Foundation (or the SVR) and Zero Hedge, and furthermore this is the first time we hear someone allege that the Foundation is linked to Russian propaganda."" “They are one of our hundreds of contributors — unlike Mainstream Media, we try to publish a wide spectrum of views that cover both sides of a given story,"" the website said. Disinformation has long been used by Putin against adversaries, including the United States, and as one tool in regional conflicts to accompany cyberattacks and the movement of military forces. Washington and Kyiv have for months highlighted the issue of Russian influence in Ukrainian media. Intelligence officials on Monday named two websites they said were directed by the Strategic Culture Foundation. Three other websites are alleged to have ties to the FSB, Russia's federal security service. “These sites enable the Russian government to secure support among the Russian and Ukrainian populations,” one official said. “This is the primary vector for how the Russian government will bolster support domestically for an invasion into Ukraine.” Officials described for the first time what they say are direct communications between Russian spies and the editors or directors of the media outlets. They did not release records of the communications. FSB officers had directed Konstantin Knyrik, the head of NewsFront, to write stories specifically damaging to Ukraine's image, U.S. officials alleged. They said Knyrik has been praised by senior FSB officers for his work and requested derogatory information that he could use against the Caucasian Knot, a website that covers news in the mostly Muslim republics of southern Russia and neighboring countries such as Georgia. The editor of PolitNavigator sent reports of published articles to the FSB, an official said. And the managing editor of Antifashist allegedly was directed at least once by the FSB to delete material from the site. PolitNavigator’s editor, Sergey Stepanov, said Washington turns a blind eye to what he says are Ukraine’s anti-democratic actions and instead labels those who point them out “anti-Ukrainian propagandists” and “agents of the FSB.” “I would like to believe that American journalism will rise above the hysteria provoked by officials,” he added. The Strategic Culture Foundation is accused of controlling the websites Odna Rodyna and Fondsk. The foundation's director, Vladimir Maximenko, has met with SVR handlers multiple times since 2014, officials alleged. Several of the sites have small social media followings and may not appear influential at first glance, noted Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund's Alliance for Securing Democracy. But falsehoods or propaganda narratives often start small before they're amplified by larger actors, he said. “You see the narrative enter the information space, and it’s very hard to see where it goes from there,"" he said. A manifesto published on Zero Hedge's site defends its use of anonymous authors and proclaims its goal is “to liberate oppressed knowledge.” Many articles are published under the name Tyler Durden, also a character in the movie “Fight Club.” The website was an early amplifier of conspiracy theories and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. An Associated Press investigation determined the site played a pivotal role in advancing the unproven theory that China engineered the virus as a bioweapon. It’s also posted articles touting natural immunity to COVID-19 and unproven treatments. Zero Hedge was also cited in a recent report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue that examined how far-right extremists are harnessing COVID-19 misinformation to expand their reach. Twitter briefly suspended Zero Hedge’s account in 2020 but reinstated it a few months later, saying it “made an error in our enforcement action in this case.” The U.S. moving to name the website could inform some people who come across its content online, Schafer said. “My guess is that most of the people who are loyal Zero Hedge followers naturally are inclined to mistrust the U.S. government anyway,"" he said, “and so this announcement is probably not going to undermine most of Zero Hedge’s core support.” ___ Associated Press journalists Lynn Berry in Washington, Angela Charlton in Paris and David Klepper in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.",Politics/Associated Press,US accuses financial website of spreading Russian propaganda,https://news.yahoo.com/us-accuses-financial-website-spreading-122709021.html
2/16/2022,"Former New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez is part of a group of investors looking to buy Trump's DC hotel. Rodriguez is part of the $375 million deal for the property, which will see it rebranded. Trump has, however, openly expressed his dislike for the former Yankees slugger, calling him a ""druggie."" Former New York Yankees baseball player Alex Rodriguez — better known as A-Rod — has been revealed to be part of a group of investors looking to buy over the lease to former President Donald Trump's Washington DC hotel. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the Associated Press reported on Monday that Rodriguez, who Trump has publicly mocked on numerous occasions, is part of the $375 million deal for the Trump International Hotel in DC. The sources did not reveal the size of Rodriguez's stake in the deal, per the AP. According to the AP, should the deal go through, Rodriguez might find himself helping Trump recoup some $73 million in losses from the hotel and possibly even turn a profit. Rodriguez is one of the partners in a Miami-based fund led by investment management firm CGI Merchant Group that is looking to buy over the rights to lease the property — a 263-room hotel a stone's throw from the White House, the AP reported. The Trump family currently owns the lease for the Trump hotel in DC, while the hotel building is owned by the federal government, per The Wall Street Journal. Representatives for Rodriguez and The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider. The beef between Trump and Rodriguez dates back to 2012 when Trump said in an interview that he would have fired Rodriguez, who had earlier admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs while playing with the Texas Rangers. Speaking as a Yankees fan, Trump called Rodriguez a ""liability"" to the team at the time. Trump also tweeted more than 60 times about Rodriguez between 2012 and 2016, sometimes calling the athlete a ""joke"" and a ""druggie,"" according to Yahoo News. In his tweets, Trump repeatedly referred to a doping scandal in 2014 that resulted in Rodriguez being banned for 162 games and the playoffs. Trump biographer Michael D'Antonio said the pending deal is proof of Trump's priorities. ""This is just more proof that the only thing that matters to Trump is money,"" D'Antonio told the AP. ""If A-Rod can bail out Trump and get him out of a sticky situation and help him turn a profit, he's going to take that deal. He'd take it from Hillary Clinton.""

2/16/2022,"A former Marine Corps captain who authorities say traveled to Cambodia in 2005 to drug, rape and otherwise sexually abuse young girls was sentenced Monday to 210 years in federal prison. Michael Joseph Pepe, 68, has been in federal custody since 2007 and was previously convicted on separate charges that were thrown out in 2018. He was sentenced Monday by U.S. District Judge Dale S. Fischer, who called his actions ""monstrous"" and ""horrific,"" according to the U.S. attorney's office for the Central District of California. ""What he did to those pre-teen girls … was torture,"" Fischer said, adding that there was ""no justification for a sentence that would ever allow [Pepe] to be released from prison."" Jurors heard testimony during a seven-day trial in August from eight victims who were as young as 9 years old when Pepe abused them, prosecutors said. Each victim testified that Pepe had sexually abused them, with several saying that he bound, drugged, beat and raped them. Evidence corroborating their testimony, including homemade images of child sexual abuse, was presented in court, prosecutors said. Pepe was originally arrested in Cambodia in 2006 and was brought to the United States, where he was charged in early 2007. He was convicted by a jury in May 2008 of seven felony counts, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. According to testimony presented during his original three-week trial, Pepe was working as a civilian teacher in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, when he hired a prostitute to procure children from their families in 2005 and 2006. In addition to the victims’ testimony, prosecutors showed jurors restraints, sedatives and child sexual abuse images seized by the Cambodian National Police during a raid of Pepe’s residence in 2006. Cambodian police began investigating Pepe after one of his victims came forward. U.S. authorities joined the investigation at the request of their Cambodian counterparts. Despite a swift guilty verdict from the jury, the case was thrown into peril after prosecutors disclosed that the lead investigator had been involved in a sexual relationship with a Vietnamese interpreter who translated for some of the girls. Pepe’s defense attorney contended that the relationship between ICE Special Agent Gary J. Phillips and the interpreter had tainted the girls’ testimony. After a lengthy legal battle, he was sentenced in 2014 to 210 years in federal prison. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that conviction in 2018, and authorities retried Pepe on new charges. He was found guilty in August of two counts of traveling in foreign commerce with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, and two counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child, federal prosecutors said. A restitution hearing is scheduled for Feb. 28.

2/16/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — As president, Donald Trump never liked to leave a paper trail. He avoided email, admonished aides to stop taking notes during meetings and ripped up documents when he was finished with them. But Trump was unwilling to part with some of his administration's records when he left the White House last year, whisking them away to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Although more than a dozen boxes have since been returned to the government, the discovery alarmed archivists and historians who were already skeptical of Trump’s commitment to transparency. For them, the episode is not just a story about a presidential packrat or a sloppy filing system, but an example of how fragments of American history are at risk of being lost. Destroying or concealing documents, they said, could prevent future generations from understanding how important decisions were made. “My first reaction was words you’re probably not allowed to print,"" said Lindsay Chervinsky, a presidential historian. Academics rely on official records to paint a complete picture of every administration, and she said revelations about the documents at Mar-a-Lago were a reminder of ""how fragile that process can be if people do not follow the rules.” The Presidential Records Act, which requires the preservation of White House documents, was passed in 1978 after the Watergate scandal, when a collection of secret tapes played a defining role. Although President Richard Nixon had considered destroying them, the tapes were ultimately discovered by investigators, revealing that Nixon tried to cover up the bungled burglary of Democratic National Committee headquarters. He chose to resign rather than face impeachment and removal from office. It can be hard to believe that there's anything left to learn about Trump's presidency, which has already been the subject of around-the-clock media coverage and a small library's worth of books. But official records can still prove insightful once they become public after being processed by the National Archives, which can take years. ""History books are actually where the real accountability lies,"" Chervinsky said. ""If we don’t have that full story, it’s not an accountability system. And the very heart of a democracy is that leaders are accountable to the people.” Trump’s erratic handling of documents could have more immediate effects than the eventual judgment of historians. The congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021 is examining the former president’s actions that day, but finding gaps in official records such as call logs. There’s also the potential for legal trouble if Trump or his associates are determined to have mishandled any documents, especially if they’re classified. Presidents have the power to declassify any information they choose, but that expires after they leave office. Concealing or destroying records is a crime with a potential prison term of three years; storing classified information in an unauthorized location can carry a sentence of up to five years. Sandy Berger, President Bill Clinton’s former national security adviser, removed classified documents from the National Archives in 2003. He claimed he took the files to help prepare testimony to the 9/11 Commission, which was probing intelligence failures in the years leading up to the terrorist attacks in 2001. Berger pleaded guilty and, instead of serving time behind bars, he paid a $50,000 fine. The House Oversight Committee has asked the National Archives to detail the records it recovered from Mar-a-Lago by Friday. Trump suggested in a statement that there was nothing nefarious about the boxes that were stored at his Florida resort. He said it’s been “a great honor” to work with the National Archives “to help formally preserve the Trump Legacy."" There's never been a case where a former commander in chief has been punished for violating the Presidential Records Act. Lee White, director of the National Coalition for History, said Congress failed to improve enforcement when it updated the law in 2014. “The law basically relies on the current president to follow the rules of the road,” he said. The White House produces geysers of records, including emails, calendars and transcripts. President Barack Obama’s administration left behind an estimated 300 million emails — more than 1 billion pages if printed out — and another 30 million pages of paper documents. All of these are funneled into the National Archives through painstaking work that is intended to prevent anything from falling through the cracks. For example, a digital copy of a memo isn't sufficient if someone printed it out and took notes in the margins during a meeting. White said archivists explain all of this to staff members when a new administration takes over. “You don’t just get hired at the White House and they stick you at your desk. They walk you through all these rules,” he said. “Nobody can claim ignorance.” Journalists, historians and members of the public can begin seeking documents with Freedom of Information Act requests five years after a president leaves office. However, a former president can extend the secrecy for an extra seven years under some circumstances, such as when the records involve confidential communications from advisers. President Bill Clinton chose to do that with some documents that involve his administration's failed push for health care legislation. One memo that eventually came out was from Ira Magaziner, a key aide, to Hillary Clinton, and it detailed efforts to reshape public perception of the debacle. “I am continuing to meet with different Washington ‘insiders’ to try to amend their perceptions of what occurred,"" Magaziner wrote. ""It is a grind, but I believe that it may be doing some good with some of them.” Sometimes it can take even longer for records to emerge. For example, President Lyndon Johnson taped many of his private conversations, but they didn't become available until decades after his death. When Michael Beschloss, another presidential historian, listened to them, he discovered a commander in chief unsure about the Vietnam War — “I don’t see any way of winning,” Johnson told Defense Secretary Robert McNamara in 1965 — even as he was ordering an escalation of American military operations. “We wouldn’t have known that without those tapes,” Beschloss said. He said preserving government records “gets to the heart of democracy as much as anything.” If presidents can hide or destroy whatever archival documents they want — creating their own version of history — “that’s totalitarianism,” he said.",Politics/Associated Press,Trump's stash of documents shows 'fragile' historical record,https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-stash-documents-shows-fragile-172919321.html

2/16/2022,"Questions surrounding Bob Saget’s cause of death increased after the late comedian's autopsy report revealed Saget suffered injuries to his head that are usually seen from a more traumatic blow than one typically sustains from a slip and fall, according to multiple media reports. As reported by Fox News last week, Saget’s family released a statement that said the 65-year-old comedian’s sudden death was caused by a brain bleed that occurred after Saget hit his head and went to sleep, not realizing the severity of his injury. The actor was found dead in his hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton in Orlando on January 9th after performing a comedy show in Orlando, Florida, according to the Fox News report. Health experts weighed in on the autopsy report questioning the investigation and cause of the blow to the comedian’s head that led to his death, according to an article in the Daily Mail. The outlet posted the autopsy report, which said Saget suffered multiple fractures stretching from the back to the front of the skull and along the eye sockets. It also revealed there was bleeding across both sides of his brain. The Daily Mail cited one report in which a doctor said the injuries in the autopsy appeared consistent with a blow to the skull with a baseball bat or falling 20 to 30 feet. BOB SAGET'S SHOCKING DEATH HIGHLIGHTS THE DANGERS OF HEAD INJURY Fox News spoke with Dr. Fred Davis, an Associate Chair of Emergency Medicine at Northwell Health in New York, about the recent questions surrounding the severity of Saget’s injuries. Davis, an emergency department physician and Assistant Professor at Hofstra University, on Long Island, N.Y., was not involved in Saget’s case, but told Fox News on Sunday, ""The extent of injuries as reported by the autopsy is usually seen in significant traumatic events. It involved breaks in the bones of the skull in multiple areas which tends to happen with high force injuries."" The growing belief that Saget’s injuries are from something more than a fall had experts weighing in on various media outlets. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office, which headed the investigation into Saget’s death, took to social media to address the concerns. BOB SAGET WAS BELOVED BECAUSE HE PLAYED THE AMERICAN EVERYMAN The Orange County Sheriff’s Office posted on its Twitter account a link to a media interview with Sheriff John Mina, of the Orange County Sheriff’s office, who was part of the investigation and discussed Saget’s injuries. In the interview, Mina said that although the injuries were severe, there were no signs of struggle and said, ""We do not believe he was struck by anything."" Mina also said that Saget’s injuries were likely from a fall where he hit the back of his head on a flat surface, such as a bathroom floor. The autopsy report also revealed that the comedian tested positive for COVID, though the officer and the autopsy report did not say COVID played a role in the comedian’s death. Forensic scientists told Fox News that investigations such as Saget’s are complex and involve a collaborative effort between the medical examiner, law enforcement investigators, forensic investigators including crime scene and crime lab officials, and the district attorney. They told Fox that investigative hypotheses are typically formed while the influx of substantiated evidence will prove or disprove the hypotheses. According to the Orange County Sheriff's office, Saget’s death was ruled as accidental death, there were no signs of alcohol or drugs, and the case is closed.",U.S./Fox News,Bob Saget's autopsy report reveals multiple head fractures usually seen in 'high force injuries',https://news.yahoo.com/bob-saget-apos-autopsy-report-205527607.html

Contact a qualified medical professional before engaging in any physical activity, or making any changes to your diet, medication or lifestyle. If you’ve ever struggled with sleep and have tried using over-the-counter supplements like melatonin to help you get some shut eye, rest assured you’re not alone. A new study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) analyzed data relating to melatonin use from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between the years 1999 and 2018. Researchers found that by 2018, U.S. adults were taking more than twice the amount of melatonin than they did a decade earlier. Jonathan Charest, a sleep expert with the Canadian Sleep Society tells Yahoo Canada he isn't surprised by the findings, but says many people don't understand what melatonin is— or what it does to the body. According to the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, melatonin is a natural hormone your body produces in response to darkness. Your body produces more of it at night and less during the day when you're awake. Melatonin supplements (synthetic or made from animals or microorganisms) are available and can be used as a short-term remedy to treat jet lag or disorders like delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. Charest says people should stop thinking of melatonin supplements as the ""holy grail of sleep."" He considers them to me more of a ""Trojan horse"" that can lead people to take stronger sleep aids when they realize the supplement isn't working. “That’s why I see melatonin being dangerous,"" the director of Athlete Sleep Services at the Centre for Sleep and Human Performance explains. ""Not from a lethal point of view, but from the cascade of events that will follow the consumption of melatonin because most people don’t know how to use it and don’t know what it is."" Even though melatonin isn' lethal, possible side effects include nausea, dizziness, headaches, mild anxiety and depression. It can also interact with various medications. The recent JAMA study also found that since 2006, a growing number of adults are taking more melatonin than the daily 5 milligram recommended dose. Dr. Mark Berber, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, says he doesn’t see an issue with taking melatonin to help with sleep, but urges anyone who takes it to follow dosage guidelines. “I think when it comes to choosing any medication or herb or melatonin, using the recommended dose is key,” Berber tells Yahoo Canada. “Sometimes more is not more effective, it’s just more toxic.” In Canada and the U.S., melatonin is considered a dietary supplement. However, in some countries throughout Europe and other parts of the world, it can only be acquired through prescription. Some supplements may also contain more melatonin than what's listed on the label. In a 2017 study published by the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, researchers analyzed 31 melatonin supplements and found some dosages to contain up to 478 per cent higher than what was listed on the bottle. People often use melatonin supplements as a sleep aid, but for the wrong sleep disorders. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine advises people against self-medicating with melatonin for issues like chronic insomnia and lists conditions for which it should be used for. According to the academy, melatonin can be effective when it's used to treat circadian rhythm disorder, which is when your “body’s biological clock is out of sync with societal norms.” These disorders include people who are travelling and will experience jet lag, night owls and shift workers. Charest says that melatonin is also a short-term solution and shouldn’t be used for longer than one to two months. “Melatonin was never meant to be used in the long-term, melatonin is only to be [used] to shift a circadian phase, and to retrain your circadian rhythm [24-hour cycle part of your body's internal clock],” he says. Having trouble with sleep is a common problem and it may be getting worse. The American Sleep Foundation shows up to 30 per cent of adults struggle with chronic insomnia. Berber believes the ongoing pandemic may be contributing to a spike in sleep-related problems. “Over the last two years, the COVID-19 restrictions have made life miserable for most people. There is an epidemic of depression and anxiety related to the lockdowns and other restrictions and these depressive and anxiety illnesses are often associated with poor sleep,” he explains. As for the increase in melatonin use, Berber says physicians have moved away from prescribing typical sleeping pills over the last few years because of how addictive they can become. He adds that more doctors are choosing more natural solutions for their patients, including melatonin. People who struggle with sleep should take a closer look at their nighttime routine and their sleep environment. Sleep On It Canada has a list of key actions to prioritize a healthy sleep cycle. The recommendations include going to bed and getting up at the same time every day of the week, turning off your phones when going to bed to preserve sleep quality and creating a comfortable environment. Eliminating screen time before bed and caffeine after 12 p.m. are also advised by experts. If these changes don't help and your sleep is not improving then it's time to get help. Although Charest says he melatonin for certain patients, like athletes travelling to the 2022 Beijing Olympics for their jet lag, he will most often steer patients towards Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), which focuses on identifying thoughts, feelings and behaviours that contribute to someone's problems with sleep. Charest says it “works 100 per cent more efficiently than any melatonin in the world.” “I would do the non-pill route first and foremost,"" he adds. ""Here [at the clinic] we stick with CBT-I and we work with sleep physicians of course when pharmacological approaches are needed we use them with the physician. Both Berber and Charest agree, as soon as you notice your quality of life decreasing due to lack of sleep, you should seek professional help. “Sleep is at the core centre of your mental health and your physical health. It requires and deserves as much care as any other things around your health,” Charest says. Let us know what you think by commenting below and tweeting @YahooStyleCA!

Chinese social media users expressed alarm at the mascot's gruff voice, which sounded like a middle-aged Chinese man. Chinese social media users have expressed dismay after the voice of the Beijing Games' popular mascot, Bing Dwen Dwen, was accidentally revealed to be that of a gruff, middle-aged man. Last Tuesday, the mascot was heard speaking during a video interview by state broadcaster CCTV with Chinese freestyle skier Yang Shuorui. Towards the end of the session, Bing Dwen Dwen was heard telling Yang to take care of herself. Many Chinese viewers were shocked to hear the rotund, fluffy mascot sounding like a middle-aged man with a northeastern accent and took to Weibo — China's Twitter-like platform — to express their dismay. ""This is the end of my fantasy. The adult world has no room for fairy tales,"" read one of the top comments on the video from a Weibo user named LingYun ShiHan. ""I don't find Bing Dwen Dwen cute anymore. It's an old man! I'm saving my money,"" read another comment from a Weibo user with the ID Great-Annie. Another Weibo post seen by the South China Morning Post said, ""People don't want to know that when they hug Bing Dwen Dwen, they're holding a strange man."" According to SCMP, the Chinese authorities have censored negative posts about the mascot and have taken down a Weibo hashtag linked to negative comments on Bing Dwen Dwen. The Beijing Games' art director Lin Chunzhen clarified in a February 13 interview with ShanghaiEye that the mascot's design does not include a voice. ""At the beginning of the process when we designed this auspicious mascot, we strictly obeyed the rule that the mascot character should not have a speaking voice,"" Lin told the media outlet. ""It can make squeaky noises, but it can't speak."" Gruff voice or no, Bing Dwen Dwen has been a top seller in the Beijing Games, with people queueing in the capital's icy cold for hours to pick up prized merchandise. The Bing Dwen Dwen souvenirs have been re-sold online for as much as $500, roughly 17 times their retail price.

2/16/2022,"A leak site says it has received a cache of information, including about donors to the Ottawa truckers' Freedom Convoy protest, after fundraising site GiveSendGo was targeted by hackers overnight. On Monday, GiveSendGo's website said it was ""under maintenance,"" hours after the site was hijacked and redirected to a page believed to be controlled by the hackers, which no longer loads. The redirected page condemned the truckers who descended on Canada's capital to oppose mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations, causing widespread disruption to traffic and trade for more than a week. The page also contained a link to a file containing tens of thousands of records of what was described as ""raw donation data"" about those who donated to the Freedom Convoy. A short time later, nonprofit leak site Distributed Denial of Secrets said it had received 30 megabytes of donor information from GiveSendGo, including self-reported names, email addresses, ZIP codes and IP addresses. Distributed Denial of Secrets, a site known for hosting sets of leaked data involving far-right groups, said that the data would only be provided to researchers and journalists. GiveSendGo co-founder Jacob Wells did not respond to a request for comment. The breach is separate from an earlier security lapse, in which GiveSendGo left exposed to the internet an Amazon-hosted S3 bucket storing over a thousand identity documents, according to journalist Mikael Thalen, who first reported the data breach overnight. The Boston, Massachusetts-based GiveSendGo became the primary donation service for the ""Freedom Convoy"" last month after GoFundMe halted the crowdsourcing campaign and froze millions of dollars in donations, citing police reports of violence across Ottawa. Over the weekend, a Canadian court issued an order halting access to the funds collected by GiveSendGo, which the company said it would defy. Earlier in the month, the protesters raised more than $8 million for the Freedom Convoy. Updated to clarify that the data given to Distributed Denial of Secrets was for the Freedom Convoy data, not every campaign.

New York City residents expressed shock and outrage on Sunday after an Asian woman was fatally stabbed by a man with a lengthy rap sheet, which included 27 charges from a single arrest last month.

The killing reportedly took place in the victim’s Chinatown apartment at 111 Chrystie St. in the wee hours of the morning, leaving neighbors terrorized and fearful for their own safety, reported the New York Post.

Christina Yuna Lee, 35, was found in her bathtub “bleeding from multiple wounds to her body,” according to New York police. A neighbor phoned 911 after hearing Lee scream for help.

“She was calling for help, screaming for help. I woke up to it. It was awful,” the neighbor told the New York Post. “‘Help me! Call 911’ – that’s exactly what she said over and over and over again.”

Surveillance video shows the suspect following Lee into her apartment moments before the gruesome attack. Responding officers recovered a bloody knife, which they believe to be from Lee’s own kitchen.

Officers from the 5th Precinct reportedly responded at around 4:35 a.m. They arrested 25-year-old Assamad Nash, who allegedly hid under the bed after trying to flee through the fire escape.

Nash, who is reportedly homeless, has three active cases and a history of multiple escapes from police custody. Just last month, he was charged with 27 counts of criminal mischief for damaging MetroCard machines, according to the New York Post.

Overall, the 25-year-old was reported to have at least seven arrests dating back to 2015, ABC7 New York reported. He is expected to be charged for Sunday’s incident today.

“So much blood. My wife said I should call someone to clean all the blood but I’m going to clean it up myself. It’s the least I can do for that poor girl,” said the building owner of Lee’s apartment, according to the New York Post.

Lee’s killing took place barely a month after Michelle Go was shoved into the path of an oncoming subway train in Manhattan. Since the onset of COVID-19, New York City has led the country in cases of violence against Asian Americans.

“It’s been two long years, and especially with the last couple of months with Omicron we’ve seen yet another spike in anti-Asian hate. Now, maybe this is a hate crime. Maybe this is not a hate crime. But it’s yet another Asian woman. Another Asian American was brutally attacked and killed in her own home. Think about that,” State Sen. John Liu said, according to amNewYork.

“So when the Asian American community is upset, and frustrated and downright angry, you know where it’s coming from. People do not feel safe, and part of this is that government at all levels need to pay more attention.”

Lee, who is Korean American, graduated from Rutgers University and served as a senior creative producer at digital music platform Splice, per The New York Times. She also worked on media campaigns for companies such as Equinox and Marriott International.

2/16/2022,"An accounting firm’s decision to cut ties with the Trump Organization spells very bad news for former President Donald Trump, according to conservative attorney George Conway. Trump’s longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA, sent a letter on Feb. 9 to Trump Organization executive vice president and chief legal officer Alan Garten notifying him of the firm’s decision to drop the business as a client. It also said that the financial statements it prepared for Trump between 2011 and 2020 “should no longer be relied upon.” Those statements are at the center of two investigations into whether Trump illegally inflated the values of his assets to defraud lenders. The Mazars letter was included in a court document filed Monday by New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office. According to Conway, who is married to Trump’s former senior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, having a decade’s worth of financial statements pulled by accountants is “just about the most calamitous thing” that could happen to any business with outside financing or investors. “This is worse for him than being impeached twice,” he added. For any business (including a privately-held one) that has outside financing or investors, having your financial statements (let alone 10 years' worth!) pulled by your accountants is just about the most calamitous thing that could happen to it, other than perhaps being indicted. — George Conway (@gtconway3d) February 14, 2022 This is worse for him than getting impeached twice. — George Conway (@gtconway3d) February 14, 2022 The firm compiled the financial statements based on information provided by Trump and the business. In its letter, the firm said it had reached its decision based, in part, on filings made by the attorney general’s office last month and on its own investigation and information received from various sources. “While we have not concluded that the various financial statements, as a whole, contain material discrepancies, based upon the totality of the circumstances, we believe our advice to you to no longer rely upon those financial statements is appropriate,” the letter said. Conway interpreted the language for his followers: ""decision regarding the financial financial statements""=they are false because you lied""totality of the circumstances""=the D.A. is serious ""non-waivable conflict of interest""=we are now on team D.A.""not able to provide new work product""=sorry we're not going to jail for you https://t.co/jbK2WUjncypic.twitter.com/NbbDhUCbrL — George Conway (@gtconway3d) February 14, 2022 Conway also spotted a detail in the numbering system used on the firm’s letter, which he said indicated that accountants had provided extensive materials to prosecutors. check out the Bates number on the Mazars letter pic.twitter.com/tPKLL7q8oF — George Conway (@gtconway3d) February 14, 2022 It suggests that the accountants have produced at least 525,838 pages of material to prosecutors — George Conway (@gtconway3d) February 14, 2022 Mazars USA’s letter could aid the New York attorney general’s civil probe.

2/16/2022,"STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) — A judge has sealed the criminal case file of a wealthy Connecticut woman who secretly recorded three people, including a child, in a manner involving sexual desire — a move called unusual by open government advocates and defense lawyers. Hadley Palmer, 53, who lives in a multimillion-dollar, seaside mansion in Greenwich, pleaded guilty Jan. 19 to three counts of voyeurism and risk of injury to a minor — all felonies committed in 2017. As part of her plea deal, prosecutor Daniel Cummings dropped the two most serious charges — employing a minor in an obscene performance, a Class A felony, and possession of child pornography. The voyeurism charges against her involved recording someone, naked or in their underwear, without their consent or knowledge, with “intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual desire of such person (defendant) or any other person.” Many details of the case, however, are sealed away from public view. Judge John Blawie, in Stamford, ruled Thursday that the case should be sealed, over objections by The Associated Press. The judge said the need to protect several victims’ identities outweighed the public’s right of access to criminal proceedings and documents including details of the allegations. The ruling came nearly four months after Blawie initially allowed Palmer’s case file to be sealed from public view. On the same day she was arrested on Oct. 25, Palmer appeared in court and Blawie accepted her application for a special probation program. State law requires case files to be sealed when such an application is made, but the original charges against Palmer made her ineligible for the program because they were so serious. “Having a wholesale sealing of a criminal matter like this is highly unusual and I would argue improper, especially where there are more narrowly tailored means that could exist"" to protect the victims' identities, said Jennifer Nelson, a senior staff attorney with the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Palmer declined to comment on her case following a recent court hearing. The daughter of a notable hedge fund founder, Jerrold Fine, she is currently divorcing her venture capitalist husband, Bradley Palmer. She is seen in photos on the internet at fundraising galas and other society events. Her lawyer, Michael Meehan, did not return messages seeking comment. Palmer agreed to serve a prison sentence of 90 days to five years, followed by 20 years of probation. Blawie will decide the exact sentence. The convictions also require registration on the state’s sex offender registry. But the plea agreement notes that a judge may seal the registry entry from public view if the judge determines public registration is not needed for public safety and would be likely to reveal the victims’ identities. On Feb. 4, Palmer began serving 90 days in the state women’s prison, as part of her plea agreement. The Greenwich police investigation also resulted in the arrest of a child psychologist who was charged with failing to report child abuse or neglect to authorities, as required by state law. The psychologist’s case file also is sealed. His lawyer did not return messages seeking comment. Blawie and officials at the state Judicial Branch declined to comment when asked why Blawie allowed Palmer to apply for the accelerated rehabilitation probation program and why documents cannot be redacted like they are in similar cases. Melissa Farley, a court system spokesperson, said it is policy for judges and other judiciary officials to not comment on pending cases. Blawie sealed the case file Thursday at Palmer’s request. Cummings, the prosecutor, also said the case file should be sealed, because it was not possible to redact the arrest warrant and other documents in a way that would fully protect the victims’ identities. Palmer also is asking the judge to close portions of her sentencing hearing to the public, including her own testimony — also called unusual by open courts advocates and lawyers. During the case, the court hearings have been open to the public, including a Feb. 1 hearing on Palmer’s motion to seal the file. The AP objected to a complete sealing of the case file, saying documents could be redacted and pseudonyms used as in other state court cases involving crimes against children to protect the victims while allowing the public to see how serious the allegations are. At that hearing, several lawyers for the victims said they supported sealing the case file. Connecticut’s chief public defender, Christine Perra Rapillo, whose office represents low-income defendants, said sealings of criminal case files are unusual. “I’ve never had a case where I’ve moved to seal the file,” she said. “It’s not a practice that you usually see in criminal court. The presumption in all courts, particularly criminal courts, is that the proceedings are open.” William Fish Jr., a Hartford attorney not involved in the case who specializes in open government and press access issues, said the complete sealing of criminal cases is “almost unheard of.” Add in Palmer’s wealth, Fish said, “And it makes you wonder what’s going on.” Nearly every week in Connecticut’s courts, people charged with serious crimes against children appear before judges and their case files aren’t sealed. Arrest warrants are generally available to the public, although the names of the victims may be redacted or replaced with pseudonyms. Last month in Vernon, for example, a man was charged with sexual assault, voyeurism and other crimes after police said he abused his girlfriend’s teenage daughter and secretly recorded her and others in a bathroom. He denies the charges. His case file remained open. The arrest warrant detailing the allegations remained open to public view, with the names of his girlfriend and her daughter replaced with pseudonyms. Adding to the secrecy in Palmer’s case, before Blawie sealed the file Thursday, Palmer’s name and court case numbers appeared on the criminal case webpages of the state court system’s main website only on the days she was scheduled to be in court, unlike other cases that appear daily on the website in which defendants apply for accelerated rehabilitation. After Blawie’s ruling, her name and case numbers began appearing daily on the site. Judicial Branch officials declined to comment on why that happened. In general terms, applications for accelerated rehabilitation and certain other diversion programs result in the case files being sealed but the defendants’ names and case numbers remaining on the website, officials said. Palmer withdrew her application from the probation program on Jan. 14 and immediately filed a motion the same day to seal the file. Blawie allowed the case file to remain sealed pending the required Feb. 1 hearing and his final ruling.",U.S./Associated Press,Connecticut judge seals Greenwich woman's voyeurism case,https://news.yahoo.com/connecticut-judge-seals-greenwich-womans-192352007.html
2/16/2022,"The hosts of “Morning Joe” had some strong words for Fox News and other conservative media outlets on Tuesday, calling some of their recent coverage “willfully stupid” and “deliberately lying.” Their words came on the heels of Fox News’ reporting on a recent “conflict of interest” motion filing from John Durham, in which the network alleges that lawyers for Hillary Clinton’s campaign “infiltrated” computers servers at Trump Tower and the White House, in an effort to fabricate a link between the former president and Russia. But, for the hosts of “Morning Joe,” the filing is absolute nonsense. “It is so confounding and so hard to follow,” Joe Scarborough said. “This pleading, which is indecipherable unless you have an agenda and you want to shoot first and ask questions later, which is what they did legally. This is as confusing as the initial story. I remember when the initial story came out and I read through it and I was like, what? Everybody did. That’s why nobody paid attention to it the first time because it was so convoluted looking about DNS lookups.” MSNBC journalist John Heilemann targeted Fox News’s coverage of this story directly, saying, “one of the things about this is there’s this willful or either incredibly stupid or willful misconstruing of what this is all about.” But Scarborough took it one further. “Can I just say, willfully stupid? A lot of people being willfully stupid,” he added. The hosts then argued that some of the Fox News hosts that have been covering the report are probably aware of its validity. “They know that they’re lying to their audience, that they’re liars, and they’re deliberately lying about that,” Scarborough said.",Politics/The Wrap,‘Morning Joe’ Hosts Berate ‘Willfully Stupid’ Fox News Coverage of Hillary Clinton Spying Claims,https://news.yahoo.com/morning-joe-hosts-berate-willfully-155045528.html
2/16/2022,"A Chinese performer wore a traditional South Korean hanbok during Beijing's opening ceremony. Hanboks are known as South Korea's national dress, but China says that because of its sizeable Korean population, it's part of their culture, too. In the weeks since the opening ceremony, a conflict has brewed between Chinese social media users and South Korean celebs over the garment. Several South Korean celebrities have found themselves in the middle of an online firestorm and facing a deluge of nationalistic comments from Chinese social media users over a traditional form of clothing — the hanbok. The conflict kicked off when a Chinese performer wore a hanbok — an outfit with a long-sleeved jacket and a voluminous, high-waisted skirt widely recognized as Korea's national dress — during the Beijing Winter Olympics' opening ceremony on February 4. The Chinese embassy said that the donning of a hanbok by a Chinese woman was fair game because of the two nation's shared historical origins. South Korean politicians, however, objected strongly to the wearing of the traditional garb, with some lawmakers accusing China of using the Olympic stage to lay claim to Korean culture. In the days since the Beijing Opening Ceremony, tensions around the hanbok and who gets to wear it have ratcheted up, with Chinese social media users criticizing South Korean personalities who shared pictures of themselves in the garment. It's unclear that these stars were explicitly commenting on the Olympic's hanbok controversy. Nevertheless, Weibo users attacked South Korean celebs — including BTS's Min Yoongi and Korean actress Park Shin Hye — for wearing the garment. The hanbok dates back to Korea's Three Kingdoms period (57BC-668AD), during which the kingdoms occupied the entire Korean Peninsula and a large portion of Manchuria, the latter of which is now located in modern China. While the attire bears some resemblance to the Chinese hanfu — traditionally worn by China's Han ethnic group — there has been heated debate over whether the two garment styles influenced one another. Many South Koreans saw the inclusion of the hanbok in the Olympics Opening Ceremony as a form of cultural appropriation, viewing it as an attempt by China to claim vital parts of Korean culture as its own. Responding to the outcry, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Seoul said in a statement on February 8 that the hanbok belongs to ethnic Koreans everywhere, including those who live in China. ""It is not only their wish but also their right for representatives of all ethnic groups in China to wear national costumes to attend the Beijing Winter Olympics,"" said the spokesperson. ""The Korean people in China and the north and south of the Korean Peninsula share the same origin and have a common traditional culture including clothing."" Around two million ethnic Koreans live in China, where they receive official protection as a minority group. On February 8, BTS rapper Min Yoongi — better known as Suga — posted an old picture of himself on Instagram in the gonryongpo, a type of hanbok traditionally worn by Korean kings. In response, some users on Weibo called for BTS to be ""canceled."" ""This is unforgivable. This man's fans shouldn't even stay in China. Are you even Chinese?"" read one Weibo comment calling out Min and the Chinese fans who were defending him. But r Chinese fans were quick to jump to Min's defense. ""He's Korean. What's wrong with putting up a photo of himself in hanbok? I guess they can't post pictures with clothes and should just upload nudes then,"" wrote one Weibo user. Two other Korean pop singers also received a deluge of negative comments for posting pictures of themselves in traditional attire. Girls' Generation's Hyoyeon Kim, who shared a picture of herself on Instagram in a black hanbok dress, disabled her account's comments section after receiving a wave of hateful comments. Meanwhile, Weibo users slammed K-pop singer Chung Ha for calling the hanbok ""Korean traditional attire"" during a live stream. South Korean actress Park Shin Hye posted an image of herself in the hanbok on Instagram with the hashtag #koreantraditionalclothes. As of press time, Park's Instagram post had accumulated close to 60,000 comments — many of them negative. Some commenters accused her of stealing Chinese culture and cursed her unborn child. ""In case you didn't learn history, South Korea used to be one of our Chinese vassal states. You are actually Chinese people,"" read another comment from an Instagram user named Mang Guo Ai Cao Mei. ""Vomit. I hope your child won't be like you and might have some morals,"" wrote another Instagram user with the ID Lanlanlan. The anger towards Park also spilled over into Weibo. ""Get lost. I don't care even if I liked you before. You did this to yourself. Get out, bitch,"" read one comment. The drama surrounding the hanbok is the latest social media controversy to erupt during the Beijing Games. Last week, Chinese social media users attacked BTS leader RM  for voicing his apparent support for a South Korean speed skater and slammed American-born skater Zhu Yi after she fell during her Olympics debut. A cultural rivalry between South Korea and China also emerged during last year's ""kimchi wars,"" in which social media users from both countries engaged in heated exchanges over the origins of the pickled vegetable dish.

2/16/2022,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Former U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized the Biden administration over its handling of North Korea, at an event in South Korea that included as a guest speaker former Vice-President Mike Pence. Several former leaders and top officials participated virtually or in-person at the weekend event in Seoul jointly sponsored by the Cambodian government and the Universal Peace Federation, an organization linked to the South Korea-based Unification Church, a religious group known for its mass weddings and global business and media interests. Pence, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon were among those who attended the event and spoke in person. Trump appeared in a recorded video message that was screened on Sunday at the forum. He alleged that a recent “return to escalation” that has seen North Korean leader Kim Jong Un launch missile tests would “never have happened if I were president.” He also urged North Korea not to undertake any actions that could “endanger” what he described as the “unique opportunity that we worked so hard to create together over the past four years.” The North resumed tests of shorter-range weapons threatening U.S. ally South Korea while Trump was in office in 2019. The year before, Kim had unilaterally suspended the testing of nuclear explosives and intercontinental-range ballistic missiles. Trump met Kim three times during his presidency. Their diplomacy never recovered from the collapse of their second meeting in February 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korean demands for a major release of U.S.-led sanctions in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. North Korea kicked off 2020 with ramped-up testing activity, conducting seven rounds of missile launches in January alone. Experts say the North could increase weapons demonstrations after its ally China finishes hosting the Winter Olympics in Beijing, as it attempts to move the needle with the Biden administration, which has offered open-ended talks but shown no willingness to budge on sanctions. During his speech at the weekend gathering, Pence said deepening relations between China and Russia are posing increasing threats to their democratic neighbors, according to the forum organizers. He also called for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the statement read. While in Seoul, Pence met with South Korean conservative presidential candidate, Yoon Suk Yeol, as well as foreign policy advisers to the rival ruling party of Lee Jae-myung. The U.S. politician exchanged views on North Korea, according to campaign officials with from both camps.",World/Associated Press,"Trump, Pence speak at global forum held in South Korea",https://news.yahoo.com/trump-pence-speak-global-forum-085343789.html
2/16/2022,"In 2018, while reporting from the Flat Earth International Conference in Colorado, I met a man who’d towed a rocket ship into a hotel conference room. He was Mike Hughes, an amateur rocket stuntman and vocal champion of Flat Earth theory. He hoped to launch himself into space to take a photograph that would prove once and for all whether Earth was a globe, or a flat disc. Though the answer might seem obvious to the vast majority of globe-dwellers, a small but committed movement of conspiracy theorists believes Earth is not a sphere but a great, celestial Frisbee contained within a dome. I spent years within this movement while reporting my book Off The Edge: Flat Earthers, Conspiracy Culture, and Why People Will Believe Anything. At first I believed the theory to be weird, even occasionally funny. Then in February 2020, it turned deadly serious. That month, Mike Hughes died while trying to ride his homemade rocket thousands of feet into the atmosphere. He was among a collective of conspiracy theorists pushing their inquiries to life-threatening extremes. — More from Rolling Stone From Gucci Mane Clones to Mind Control: How Conspiracy Theories Took Over the Rap Internet Team USA Is Leading a Secret Protest Movement Inside the Winter Olympics He Spent 25 Years Infiltrating Nazis, the Klan, and Biker Gangs The rocket took off like a punctured balloon, wobbly and erratic. A jagged trail of steam traced the ship’s path across the sky, up thousands of feet above the California desert. For a moment, the rocket seemed to hover, oblivious to gravity. Then the inevitable descent. To onlookers on the ground, the ship and the man inside it were a blur of black. “Come on, parachute,” one watcher murmured anxiously. “Pull it, Mike,” another man shouted. But the parachutes that had bloomed above Mike Hughes on his previous death-defying rocket launches were nowhere to be seen. “Pull it! Pull it! Oh God.” Hughes’s rocket crashed into the dust with absolute finality. There was no need to call an ambulance. Until that moment, Hughes had been one of the most famous living Flat Earthers. He had earned his fame by taking the theory to its logical conclusion. He was going to build a rocket ship, blast into Earth’s upper reaches, and see for his own eyes whether the horizon was flat or curved. “This space launch is to prove or disprove the Flat Earth,” he told me in spring 2019. I thought it was a terrible idea. I suggested, much too gently, that it was a terrible idea. I thought it was such a terrible idea that I wrote a chapter about Hughes and the cadre of conspiracy theorists attempting dangerous stunts to prove their beliefs. I titled the chapter “Someone Is Going to Die for No Reason.” Then I dropped the matter and never raised it to him again. Hughes was 64 at the time and didn’t need my advice, I reasoned. Besides, I doubted he’d really attempt the launch. For the past year, he’d notified me of various complications: parachute malfunctions and unforeseen weather that delayed his project. I began to suspect he was searching for excuses, avoiding a dangerous stunt that would force him to confront the curved horizon. I was wrong about his convictions. On Feb. 22, 2020, in a gray stretch of desert, Hughes joined the growing ranks of conspiracy-theory casualties, and I’ve had to live with that scrapped chapter title on my conscience ever since. In the mid-1840s, when Samuel Rowbotham popularized Flat Earth as a “zetetic” science, he preached that zetetics should believe only what they could personally observe. Rowbotham was a fraud, routinely borrowing and often even misrepresenting real scientists’ work when it suited him. But Hughes, with his insistence on seeing the world for himself, was one of the truest zetetics I’ve ever known. Hughes had an advantage that most other would-be zetetic Flat Earthers lacked: he knew how to build a rocket and had no fear of dangerous stunts. Born to a race-car hobbyist in 1956, Hughes spent much of his youth traveling the county-fair circuit, where his father competed in dirt-track races. Oklahoma City was home, but Hughes and his family spent so much time traveling from state to state, speedway to speedway, that life began to feel like a long racing circuit of its own. “It’s just consuming. It consumes your life,” Hughes wrote of his father’s hobby in his self-published autobiography. “You got no time for anything else and it just eats at relationships like termites to wood.” When his pit-crew gigs dried up like his racing career, Hughes started driving a limousine, and chasing thrills as a freelance stuntman on the side. While trying to outdo a famous stunt by daredevil Evel Knievel, Hughes began tinkering with homemade rockets, which could propel him on long horizontal jumps off ramps. One stunt led to the next. If he could launch across a river, he thought, then perhaps he could break the record for vertical height in a homemade rocket. He toppled that record, then broke his own record on a subsequent launch, inching upward each time until his dreams became a list of altitudes. “I don’t believe in science,” he told reporters in November 2017. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air, about the certain size of rocket nozzles and thrust. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula. There’s no difference between science and science fiction.” But there is a difference. A science fiction author can save a character from certain death with a few twists of plot. Hughes was working with the indifferent mathematical fact of gravity. And as early as a March 2018 launch — Hughes’s first after coming out as a Flat Earther— that difference very nearly killed him. Hughes had intended the launch to take him only eighteen hundred feet in the air, much too low to observe the planet’s curvature. Still, he managed to fundraise more than $7,000 online from Flat Earthers — and from people who thought his project was a big joke. They almost funded a tragedy. Short on cash, Hughes built the rocket in his garage and converted an old mobile home into a launch ramp. Then he hauled the whole thing to Amboy, a windswept California ghost town with a history of bad karma: stories of hauntings and occult rituals and bloody motel rooms. Other towns with legitimate governments had turned Hughes away, unwilling to deal with the headache of a potential rocket catastrophe. But Amboy, a popular filming location for horror movies, was virtually a theme park for destruction, and its owner welcomed Hughes for what was nearly another nightmare. As he approached his rocket (emblazoned with research flat earth), Hughes noticed a hissing noise, like an air mattress deflating. The noise was a vapor leak, but after the trip to Amboy and the makeshift launch-ramp assembly, no one knew how long the rocket had been compromised, which would determine how dangerous it would be. “We don’t know if it’s been going for five minutes or five hours,” Hughes told me. A friend who had helped with his rocket construction urged him to wait, telling him they could fix the problem, if Hughes was willing to postpone. “I said ‘You know what, I’m not waiting any longer. I got in, and I did it,” Hughes told me. His secondhand parachutes were 23 and 21 years old. “I didn’t even know if they were going to work. They were all I could afford.” One of the chutes failed on the way down, and Hughes slammed into the earth, barely clinging to consciousness. “It was pretty ugly,” he said. “I could have died.” When he recovered from the hard landing, Hughes announced his new plans to prove Flat Earth by flying to outer space in a “rockoon,” a homemade rocket attached to weather balloons that would carry it upward after the rocket fuel burned out. He would build the rockoon in his garage, ride it 68 miles above Earth’s surface, and, before gravity reclaimed him and his parachutes deployed, take a photograph of the world. It was a breathtakingly dangerous stunt, but everyone who knew Hughes said there was no talking him out of it. “He had an IQ of 136. He’s very smart,” Waldo Stakes, Hughes’s close friend who had helped him build his rockets, told me, “but he’s very hardheaded . . . Once he’s made his mind up about something, he’ll just continue no matter what. He’ll just do it.” Just do it, death be damned, is a popular sentiment among Flat Earth’s most extreme zetetics. At the 2019 Flat Earth International Conference, I found myself seated behind a man named Bobby Hartley, who wore a T-shirt advertising a 2025 trip to fabled lands beyond Antarctica. The frozen continent often conjures an air of foreboding among Flat Earthers. Like most popular Flat Earth models, including Rowbotham’s, argue that Antarctica extends like an icy ring around the pancake planet, keeping all its oceans in check. Common variations on this claim include a theory that Antarctica’s most distant edge touches the base of a dome that encloses Earth and that the international treaties against colonizing Antarctica are actually part of a nefarious scheme to prevent people from seeing the dome. This subset of believers claims that Antarctica is highly militarized and that unauthorized explorers will eventually hit a kind of polar Area 51, defended by armies of the New World Order. There are dissenters within the Flat Earth world, of course. A group called the Infinite Plane Society suggests that Antarctica extends out to eternity, a universe of ice to cradle our little blue oasis. Hartley told me he thought another world existed beyond the ice wall, and that other people likely already lived in this distant land. “I just got into Flat Earth about a year ago, but I’m obsessed with this land beyond Antarctica. I want to go there so bad,” Hartley told me. He seemed like a pleasant guy, and our conversation felt almost normal, until he divulged, laughingly, that the trip was something of a suicide mission. “Of course, we all might die. I’m not married. I have no kids.” It was a startling comment from someone I’d just met 30 seconds earlier, and I asked him whether he was serious. Apparently so. “There is about a five percent chance of me making it. Out of that five percent chance of making it, I would say a one percent chance of ever coming back. It would almost be a one-way trip.” Those odds would be worth it, even to spend 24 hours in the land beyond the ice, he said. I made some polite noises, with what I hoped was a neutral expression. I’ll probably never be any good talking death wishes with strangers, but a couple years in this scene had made me better at it. This was the second time that year, for example, that I’d spoken with a Flat Earther who had pitched me on a likely deadly trip to the lands beyond Antarctica. Months earlier, I’d spoken with Michael Marshalek, a friend of Mike Hughes, who was planning his own trip across the ice. Ikon Images/AP “Mad Mike is going up, and I’ll be headed south,” Marshalek told me. He was out to prove Flat Earth by trekking as far as Antarctica would take him. For Marshalek, all specicies of Earth’s shape were under consideration until he reached its edge. “I think it’s infinite until proven otherwise,” he said. “If there’s a dome, which many Flat Earthers believe in, I myself want to go out there and see that, take a chunk of the dome.” Like Hughes, Marshalek was making steady, even worrying progress toward setting off on his mission. A tech worker for a major New York City bank, he already had most of the funds saved for his planned expedition by the time we spoke in May 2019. He intended to reach the South Pole (or whatever’s out there) by snowkiting, a technique that involves riding skis while clinging to a large kite or sail that captures the wind. The plan had obvious challenges. Snowkiting is an extreme sport, one that leaves a rider at the mercy of sudden winds and rocky terrains — two conditions Antarctica has in frightening abundance. Snowkiting also prioritizes speed over distance. The world’s longest and most challenging snowkite race is the Ragnarok, a scrupulously supervised 100-kilometer race in Norway each year. Antarctica, meanwhile, is merciless and more than 2,381 miles (or 3,831 kilometers) across. Famed polar explorer Børge Ousland has used a kite and skis to cross parts of the continent, but he also offset them with grueling hikes in parts of the expedition where snowkiting would be, in his own words, “certain death.” And Ousland knew where he was going. He knew how much food to pack, how many days he could survive in the frozen wild before sending out an SOS. Marshalek, with his philosophy of “infinite until proven otherwise,” would not be setting out with the same luxuries. If he planned to survive a journey that could be infinite, I asked him, wouldn’t he eventually need to turn around and come home? How would he know when that was necessary? Marshalek promised to reveal his full itinerary in due time. When he did, he expected it would strike a blow against “edge-ophobes,” his term for Flat Earthers who don’t seek the planet’s outer limits. He accused edge-ophobes of being afraid to explore, caught in a gridlock of excuses about why they can’t simply traverse Antarctica. “They’re stuck in debates all the time,” he said. “They say, ‘You can’t burn fuel, there’s treaties, it’s too cold.’ They’re all excuses.” Here’s another excuse, for any Flat Earthers reading: anyone trying to sell you a ticket for a Flat Earth–oriented Antarctic expedition is probably trying to scam you. I’ve stumbled upon two of these grifts without really trying. In March 2017, someone who called himself John Bramha began registering social media accounts and buddying up with Flat Earthers online. Bramha claimed to be part of the elite group that enforced Antarctica’s boundaries, protecting it from intruders. He and a handful of others from this secret police force had turned rogue aftr discovering the wonders that lay at the earth’s edge, and now he was leading expeditions to the end of the world to share the truth of what lay beyond. For his trouble, of course, he needed funding. Specifically $1 million in hard-to-track Bitcoin payments. “You might think that’s a lot of money, but it’s just the cost of 10 Tesla Model S cars,” he told viewers in a YouTube clip. “People spend, collectively, way more than this on personal luxuries.” He planned to earn his million by selling 10 seats on his expedition for $100,000 each. He never showed his face in his videos, and the avatar he used on Facebook and Twitter had been stolen from a stock-image website. By the way, Bramha said, the $100,000 trip would cure his customers of cancer. The dome surrounding Flat Earth was actually a wall of pure energy that “cures you instantly of anything you might be suffering from, medically,” he claimed on YouTube. He shared a supposed picture of said energy wall, which looked like a pretty standard glacier. For a group that doesn’t believe in gravity or the moon, Flat Earthers were remarkably quick to support Bramha. At least one popular Flat Earth YouTube channel made a video vouching for the shadowy Antarctican, without ever meeting him. Flat Earthers tweeted that they’d filled out applications for Bramha’s $100,000 excursion, and by summer 2017 Bramha claimed (albeit dubiously) that he’d sold six tickets. Of those alleged customers, two were counting on the trip to save their lives. “We have two persons on board who are suffering from Cancer and this expedition will heal them,” Bramha wrote on Facebook. The expedition was scheduled for November 2017, at which point (of course) Bramha vanished from the internet, taking with him whatever money he’d swindled from the desperate. The popular Flat Earth YouTube channel that had vouched for him uploaded a new video, this time claiming Bramha’s scam was evidence of a conspiracy to make Flat Earthers look bad. As it turned out, the new video noted, Bramha’s picture of the “pure energy” glacier had been taken by a professional photojournalist focused on the environment and climate change. The photojournalist had won grants from scientific institutions, including NASA. The connection to NASA, that great Flat Earth bogeyman, was enough for Flat Earthers to accuse Bramha of being a “big science” saboteur. To them, Flat Earth theory was still vindicated, in its way: someone wanted to suppress its believers. Remarkably, the following year, someone else tried a similar stunt. A company called Over the Poles offered a onetime flight over part of Antarctica starting at $11,900. The trip is technically possible, although rarely attempted, due to the danger involved. One notorious 1979 Antarctic sightseeing flight left all 257 passengers and crew dead after it crashed into a mountain in whiteout conditions. Over the Poles said it was going much farther inland than that deadly crash site and, while it did not market exclusively to Flat Earthers, it acknowledged the conspiracy movement on its website. (John Bramha and Over the Poles did not return requests for comment.) Michael Marshaek told me he bought a ticket in the brief months that Over the Poles operated its website. Then, like Bramha’s venture before it, the company and all its affliates vanished from the internet, leaving people holding expensive tickets to nowhere. Yet as vicious as the Antarctica scams were to their victims, the situation could have been worse: the ice wall–curious crowd could have taken an ill-planned trip to the South Pole and died. They would all have joined the growing ranks of conspiracy theorists committing real-world harm in an effort to prove their beliefs.

2/16/2022,"Warning: This article contains descriptions of violence some readers may find disturbing.

A man has been charged in connection with a vicious attack that left a 23-year-old Thai model with a bloodied face in New York City last November.

The incident, which was caught on surveillance video, occurred on the 34th Street-Herald Square subway platform at around 4 a.m. on Nov. 22.

The victim, Bew Jirajariyawetch, was waiting for a train home when someone grabbed her from behind, dragged her along the platform, punched her in the face and took off with her wallet.

The attack left Jirajariyawetch “unquestionably traumatized” and suffering from “persistent nightmares,” her attorney Eric Parnes told the Daily Mail.
 


Jirajariyawetch, who had moved from Thailand to New York to study English and pursue a modeling career, said she was “lucky to be alive” after the incident.

On Saturday, police announced that they had charged 40-year-old Kevin Douglas with second-degree robbery, third-degree robbery and second-degree assault in connection with the attack as of last Thursday.

Douglas, however, has been in police custody since Nov. 22, when he was arrested just hours after he allegedly attacked Jirajariyawetch — for a separate crime he allegedly committed in Jamaica. Police were only able to connect him with the subway incident last week.

Records show Douglas has been arrested 44 times for crimes dating back to 1997. He was even arrested a record 16 time in a single day on May 13, 2019, according to the New York Post.

2/16/2022,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nevada’s first execution in nearly 16 years is on hold again after the state’s lawyers told a federal judge on Monday they couldn’t possibly satisfy the legal requirements necessary to put Zane Michael Floyd to death before April. “It would be impossible,” Randall Gilmer, chief deputy Nevada attorney general, told U.S. District Judge Richard Boulware II. Gilmer said during the brief hearing Monday that Clark County prosecutors have not obtained a formal death warrant necessary to execute him by lethal injection before one of the drugs the state plans to use expires on Feb. 28. Boulware scheduled a status hearing for April 5. Floyd, 46, was convicted in 2000 of killing four people and wounding a fifth in a shotgun attack at a Las Vegas grocery store. He does not want to die. The state’s lawyers requested Monday that Boulware go ahead and rule on evidence both sides presented late last year about whether the existing drug protocol and corrections training requirements are legal. But the judge said he will address the next steps on those matters at the April status hearing. “We’re not going to resolve that today,” Boulware said during the 30-minute hearing Monday. “We don’t need to figure this out today because we’ll be coming back in April.” Prosecutors had faced a warrant deadline Sunday because state law calls for two weeks’ notice to schedule an execution. Gilmer said that meant the Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson would need to seek and obtain a death warrant from a state judge before now. Daryl Mack was the last person put to death in Nevada, in 2006, for a 1988 rape and murder in Reno. Mack asked for his lethal injection to be carried out. Boulware has held hearings since November to collect testimony from expert witnesses for both sides about whether Nevada’s combination of drugs would cause Floyd so much pain that his lethal injection would be unconstitutionally cruel and inhumane. Nevada prison officials want to use large doses of three or four drugs including the potent synthetic opioid fentanyl, the sedative ketamine, possibly a muscle paralytic called cisatracurium, and either potassium chloride or potassium acetate to stop Floyd’s heart. The drug alfentanil might substitute for fentanyl. The ketamine now held by Nevada prison officials expires Feb. 28, and Gilmer has said prison officials don’t think they can quickly obtain more. Pharmaceutical companies and drug suppliers have said they don’t want their products used in an execution in Nevada. Floyd had exhausted appeals, and his execution was scheduled last July. But it was then delayed by Boulware and a state court judge pending the result of additional court proceedings — including several petitions still pending before the Nevada Supreme Court. Boulware said Monday the state Supreme Court must rule on those matters before any execution can occur. One of those cases challenges whether the state judge assigned to handle Floyd’s case can continue in that role. Prison officials also face having to recruit doctors and emergency medical technicians willing to take part in an execution, after the physicians and drug administrators they had enlisted dropped off the list amid fears they might one day be publicly identified. ____ Sonner reported from Reno, Nevada",U.S./Associated Press,Nevada's first execution in nearly 16 years on hold again,https://news.yahoo.com/nevadas-first-execution-nearly-16-191028009.html
