1/27/2022,"Liberal supreme court justice Stephen Breyer is retiring and Joe Biden has said he will stand by a previous promise to nominate a Black woman to America’s highest legal body. At 83 years old, Breyer is the oldest justice of the court and his retirement will give Biden his first seat to fill on the supreme court, which is currently conservative-leaning by six to three. Replacing Breyer won’t allow Biden to change that dynamic but it does allow him to ensure the liberal contingent is not reduced further and make history by appointing its first Black woman.  Here are some of the women considered leading contenders for the seat: Ketanji Brown Jackson Born in Washington DC and raised in Miami, Florida, Jackson has been a judge of the US court of appeals for the DC circuit since June 2021 after the 51-year old Harvard graduate replaced Attorney General Merrick Garland. The DC circuit has historically been seen as a stepping stone to the supreme court. From 2010 to 2014, Jackson served as vice chair of the United States sentencing commission, during which the commission significantly reduced sentences for numerous drug offenders. Leondra Kruger Kruger, a native of Los Angeles, is an associate justice of the supreme court of California. The 45-year-old was previously the acting principal deputy solicitor general under the Barack Obama administration. Supreme court justice Elena Kagan once called Kruger “one of the best advocates in the Department of Justice.” Kruger has argued 12 cases in front of the supreme court. She has previously described her approach to the law as one that “reflects that fact that we operate in a system of precedent”. J Michelle Childs Childs is currently serving as a district judge of the US district court for the district of South Carolina. Appointed by Obama in 2009, the 55-year-old Detroit native has also been nominated by Biden for a seat on the DC circuit court of appeals. Childs was also the first Black woman to become a partner at Nexsen Pruet, LLC, one of South Carolina’s major law firms. She has served as the deputy director in the labor division at South Carolina’s Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. Close Biden ally congressman Jim Clyburn is a fierce ally of Childs and has previously pushed the Biden administration to nominate Childs as the supreme court’s next liberal justice. “She is the kind of person who has the sort of experiences that would make her a good addition to the supreme court,” Clyburn said. Wilhelmina Wright Wright is a district judge of the US district court for the district of Minnesota. A favorite of Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the 58-year-old is also Minnesota’s first African-American justice. Wright has previously said that fairness, impartially and respect for the rule of law have been her “lodestar”, adding that she “give[s] no consideration to whether I agree or disagree with a party”. She has also emphasized the importance of diversity in the judicial system, at one point writing: “I believe it would undermine the public’s trust and confidence in the judiciary if there were no judges who are women or judges of color.” Eunice Lee Since August 2021, Lee, 52, has been a judge of the US court of appeals for the second circuit after being nominated by Biden. Lee has worked at the office of the appellate defender in New York City from 1998 to 2019. In addition, from 2019 until her bench appointment, Lee was an assistant federal defender in the appeals bureau of the federal defenders of New York. Candace Jackson-Akiwumi Jackson-Akiwumi is currently a US circuit judge of the US court of appeals for the seventh circuit since July 2021. Jackson-Akiwumi is the first judge appointed to the seventh circuit who has a background as a federal public defender. Nominated by Biden in April 2021, Jackson-Akiwumi was also a staff attorney at the federal defender program in the northern district of Illinois from 2010 to 2020 where she represented indigent people who were accused of federal crimes. From 2020 to 2021, Jackson-Akiwumi served as a partner at Zuckerman Spaeder, a DC-based law firm where she focused on civil litigations and white collar criminal defense. Sherrilyn Ifill Ifill is the president and director-counsel of the Legal Defense and Educational Fund at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Prior to joining LDF as an assistant council in 1988, the 59-year-old New York native was a fellow at the American Civil Liberties Union. Ifill taught civil procedure and constitutional law for over two decades and pioneered numerous law clinics, including one of the first law clinics in the country that focused on challenging legal obstacles to the re-entry of ex-offenders. In 2021, Time named her one of the world’s 100 most influential people.",News/Law,The leading female contenders to succeed Breyer on supreme court,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/26/supreme-court-stephen-breyer-retiring-leading-female-contenders
1/27/2022,"Paul Collingwood has launched a remarkable defence of England’s players who were thrashed by Australia in the Ashes, saying their preparation for the series and the gruelling effect of two years in biosecure bubbles meant they went into it as “sitting ducks”. The assistant coach also believes that the tourists never had a chance of succeeding, that despite their poor performances they “deserve medals not criticism”, and that the series “was one step too far”.  The manner of England’s defeat led Joe Root to call for a reset of a county system that he says is failing the national team, the England captain saying that “anyone that’s coming into the Test team is doing it in spite of county cricket, not because of it”. But Collingwood, three times an Ashes winner as a player, suggested the main cause of the team’s failure lies elsewhere. He said: “I reckon if you had given us the best England cricketers from the last 100 years and put them in the same environment that those boys have lived in over the past two years with the preparation that we had going into this Ashes, even then they wouldn’t have had a chance.” Collingwood had particular sympathy for those who came to Australia straight from the T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates: “It’s the equivalent of the England football team being asked to go to a World Cup, then from that bubble into the Euros. Would you expect a performance from that scenario? It’s ludicrous.” He believes that for all the talk about the impact of bubbles on cricketers it remains significantly underplayed. “You can’t even explain what it’s like until you experience it,” he said. “In 2020 we went into the Ageas Bowl and Old Trafford, and they don’t bring back nice memories. I’ve been scarred by what we had to go through in those places. You are living in the ground. You wake up, look out the window and there is the pitch. You cannot get away from it, can’t get out … If you’re a batsman, imagine if you nick off. All you want to do is get away, see the family, see friends that don’t talk about cricket. But you just can’t get away from it. “We kept cricket going for those two years. We had to do it for financial reasons. Players have had to sacrifice things, as have their families. You don’t see families when you are in the bubbles, or if they do come in it’s an awful environment for them to be in. It’s going to be impossible to measure the effect that had. “Australia is the hardest place to go to when you’ve got your best team in form and everyone’s playing consistently, never mind during a period of mental fatigue. “Hopefully bubbles are starting to move out of cricket now, because we have to protect the mental health of the players and management. What I have seen over the last two years is that we’ve kept the show on the road, and we saved a lot of jobs doing that. The Ashes was one step too far.” Collingwood’s concern is that the gruelling impact of the pandemic on international cricketers will cause some to suffer serious long-term psychological issues and others simply to give up on the game, pointing to the South African Quinton de Kock’s decision to announce his Test retirement at the age of 29, and his compatriot Chris Morris retiring from all forms of cricket at 34, both within the last month. “Take someone like Chris Woakes, the most lovable and down-to-earth guy. I have seen him in some serious mental states,” Collingwood added. “We have seen Ben Stokes, someone we consider to be the most mentally tough cricketer in the world, being hit by this. I just hope there are no ramifications. These are things that might come out down the line. That’s what scares me.” Collingwood left the Ashes squad midway through the series to spend some time at home before travelling to Barbados, where he is acting as head coach for the T20 series against West Indies while Chris Silverwood, who has been the subject of intense criticism because of England’s Test performances, takes a break from the game. “To come away during the second Test was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done,” Collingwood said. “I was watching it thinking: ‘I just want to be out there.’ But I had to come home because I needed to see my daughters. “Going into the Ashes series off the back of a tough, tough bubble in Dubai I think was a step too far. I sympathise 100% with Spoons [Silverwood]. He has been criticised for rest and rotation. You understand when you are inside the bubbles that you have to get people out of there. He is one person who has really looked after his players and management. Him more than anyone else has been in those bubbles and tried to fight it through. I have 100% sympathy with Spoons, but I don’t think people really understand it unless they’ve been there.” Collingwood said that a five-Test Ashes series, coming immediately after the T20 World Cup and which would inflict such strain on the players involved and their families, should never have been attempted. “Yes, we made mistakes, 100% we made selection mistakes, we made toss mistakes, but the fact we actually turned up and agreed a five-match Ashes series, the guys should be given medals for that,” he said. “It would’ve been much better if we’d done two matches and then three next year. That would’ve been a great compromise. But no, Australia were not bothered that they were going to receive an England team who were mentally fatigued, they just wanted to get the product out there. They just wanted the Ashes. We were sitting ducks.”",Sport/Sport,‘Sitting ducks’: Collingwood defends England after Ashes bubble fatigue,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/26/paul-collingwood-defends-sitting-ducks-england-and-blames-ashes-bubble-fatigue
1/27/2022,"There was a programme, many years ago, about a specialist teacher and a class of mature learners who fell short of full literacy. It was extraordinary to watch as the teacher applied different teaching methods to help his students. The majority just needed reteaching in the standard way now they had matured and left childhood restlessness – or miseries – behind. Others needed more specialist help, which gradually winnowed the students down until there was just one left. She was desperate to be able to read, and convinced she never would. Her brain resisted all attempts to unlock the mystery for her, until the teacher realised the student was a kinaesthetic learner and had wooden letters made for her. She ran her hands over them and understood immediately what teachers had been trying to tell her for 40 years. There was no moment of such high drama in Jay Blades: Learning to Read at 51 (BBC One), but the punchy directness of the Repair Shop presenter and furniture restorer kept things lively. For people like him, Blades explained – one of the 8 million adults in the UK who struggle with reading – the process is “like giving yourself a headache … Pure pain.”  He has never read a book (including his autobiography – he told his life story to a ghostwriter) and once took a letter he knew was urgent from the hospital out on to the street to ask for help from a passerby because he had no one at home to help. On The Repair Shop, the production team brief him verbally before each scene rather than provide written notes. Like an estimated 10% of the UK population, Blades is dyslexic. But he was only diagnosed – after much prompting to make an appointment by his now ex-wife – at the age of 31. Words squiggle around on the page and his brain tries to guess what they are as they slip away from him. This is his first attempt at mastering the elusive skill since school. We follow him through six months of online lessons with Emma, a volunteer trained in the phonics method. We see enough of their interactions to demonstrate the size of the task before them and his difficulties with it, without lingering unnecessarily. He is provided with coloured filters to lay over the page, which stop the words swimming around. It is fascinating, for those of us lucky enough to have been successfully taught at a young age, to see the learning process anew. And perhaps even more fascinating to feel the innate points of connection that persist between the trained and untrained brain. You feel that, were you coming to it cold as he is, you too would find “muh” for “mouth” easier to understand than “eh” for “egg”. Nothing makes it clearer that the difference between literacy and illiteracy is not one of intelligence or ability – it is only education, and Blades’s childhood illustrates the contingency of that. “Did my mum ever read anything to me? Nah, that never happened,” he says in response to his fiancee’s question. “Did yours?” Yes, she says. “Really?” Blade’s mum was, he says, a busy, working single parent of two who came to the UK from Barbados at 13 and had got pregnant very young (“The man who contributed to my birth was nowhere to be seen.”) Blades grew up on a Hackney estate in the 70s – not a great place to be then, he says – and went unsupported at school, leaving without any qualifications. He dabbled in drug dealing, but got himself out and into a mature student university place. After a mental breakdown from which he was rescued by people he now calls his chosen family, he went on to the furniture restoration and television career he has now. “They took me in and saved my life,” he says, as he sits down to lunch with them. “If you don’t have support, what can you achieve?” “Well,” says his chosen mum, patting his hand, “you’re here now.” It’s a fine, tightly focused look at the many interdependent causes of illiteracy, and its effects, with unusually honest appraisals of them from Blades (who seems constitutionally incapable of flannel) and contributors. The educational psychologist Jackie Murray lays the problem out especially clearly. About 25% of state school pupils don’t meet expected reading standards by the age of 11. With dyslexia affecting about 10%, the statistical links between receipt of free school meals and attainment suggest that poverty and the lack of resources to combat it account for almost all the rest.

1/27/2022,"The annual Guinness Six Nations launch, much like the first daffodil, is one of the traditional harbingers of spring. The world’s oldest annual rugby championship rarely disappoints and lends instant colour to winter’s grey canvas. This year its imminent arrival is more welcome than ever, with the widespread return of full stadia and travelling supporters already raising the spirits of players, punters and publicans alike.  Was an extra frisson discernible as the 2022 coaches and captains laid out their respective ambitions? It was hard to tell via the various video linkups but there was absolute agreement in one respect. Everyone involved is anticipating a cracking tournament, with hopes high that last autumn’s thrills and spills will be faithfully replicated when the fur starts to fly on Saturday week. As Scotland’s head coach, Gregor Townsend, was quick to stress – “it does make a difference” – England will not be entering a muted Edinburgh echo chamber when they head north. Wales’s new captain Dan Biggar felt similarly – “we’re hoping the advantage of playing three games at home with full crowds is going to be a huge plus” – although performing decently also helps. Wales, contrary to many predictions, hoisted last year’s title without a single massed choir or inflatable leek in sight. The other universally acknowledged truth is that teams who begin strongly frequently prosper. In this case, with Ireland and France both beating New Zealand in November, and Scotland and England also in promising autumn form, the opening two weekends will be particularly key, as the English found when the Scots upset them at Twickenham last year. “The first couple of weeks are pivotal as to how the campaign will go for you,” Biggar confirmed. “If you get off to a good start everything becomes a lot easier.” As things presently stand, with France’s Covid issues seemingly fading, it is England who have most still to resolve before the curtain goes up. Even before a fire near their hotel in Brighton on Tuesday night forced the entire squad to relocate to a nearby pub, injuries were already an issue. With Owen Farrell now out of the tournament, Jonny May facing knee surgery, Jonny Hill doubtful for Scotland and Joe Marler still isolating with Covid, Eddie Jones has plenty on his plate. Footage of his team training on a chilly, pebbly Brighton beach and passing weights to each other in a freezing sea were also a conspicuous contrast to the warm weather Portuguese camps of years past, though arguably better preparation for a cold, damp day at Murrayfield. Townsend, either way, is taking nothing for granted as Jones weighs up his leadership, midfield and back five pack options. “Whatever team England put out we know they’re going to be strong,” Townsend said, suggesting the visitors would pose a more attacking threat with Marcus Smith at 10. “If he’s selected then England will play a different way. They’re going to have to bring Marcus into the game and show his strengths so we’ve got to negate that. You have to play close to your best to beat a team of England’s quality.” Something similar, though, is true of France with the Italy coach Kieran Crowley openly hailing them as the squad to beat. “France for me are the team of the moment in world rugby,” said the former All Black full-back. “I think they are the favourites for the next World Cup.” With the Azzurri heading to Paris on Sunday week, some deliberate posterior smoke-blowing is involved but not many right now would dispute his general contention. Fabien Galthié, still channelling his inner Roy Orbison with those tinted, black-rimmed glasses, has had his players training at the Foreign Legion’s base near Marseille and expects his 14 unavailable personnel to be back in the mix by Sunday. Italy, meanwhile, have not entirely given up hope of Sergio Parisse featuring later in the championship once he is match fit again following a broken hand and a dose of Covid. In some ways, though, nobody is approaching the annual game of gumshield-wearing Cluedo more eagerly than the revved-up green machine of Ireland. Having beaten New Zealand, expectations are suitably high and the recent displays of the Irish provinces have further bolstered that optimism. Unlike England they will be limbering up in Portugal and Andy Farrell is challenging his team to “push new boundaries” and aim high. “It makes me laugh when coaches say they want to finish second or third,” Farrell said. “I don’t know anyone who doesn’t want to finish first.” His captain Johnny Sexton also seems pumped for the opener against Wales when he and Biggar could set a collective all-comers record for the most talkative pair of captains in history. “Over the years they haven’t been shy in saying they’re not mad about the Irish,” Sexton said. “They are different players when they play for Wales and they’ll turn up 100% ready to go. They won the Championship last year, they were close to winning another grand slam and they’re a team to be reckoned with.” The Wales coach Wayne Pivac, though, is lacking a raft of senior players through injury and is disinclined to wallow in the past or dwell on their status as defending champions. “It’s a nice tag to have but that was last year,” he stressed, suggesting his side could be “a little bit undercooked” in terms of preparation. “Challenges probably don’t come much bigger … but we’d like to think we’ve got a few champion players.” Relief from a grim, Covid-strewn winter is almost here.",Sport/Sport,Sparks will fly in Six Nations with crowds back and competition fierce | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/26/sparks-will-fly-in-six-nations-with-crowds-back-and-competition-fierce
