4/4/2022,"This riveting documentary about one of the media world’s most scandalous family sagas opens with footage of the yacht that newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell was holidaying on when he suddenly disappeared while facing huge financial questions. Using first-hand testimonies from those who worked with the Maxwells, alongside never-before-aired recordings, this three-part series shows us the world of power and secrets that the disgraced former socialite Ghislaine Maxwell grew up in. We follow her story through to the present day, where she is caught up in perhaps the family’s most notorious scandal, after being convicted in 2021 of recruiting and grooming teenage girls for sexual encounters with Jeffrey Epstein. Hollie Richardson A team of “ethical hackers” tracks the activity of scammers in real time for this new series. With a reassuring voice on the phone and call centre mumbling in the background, it’s easy to see why retired actor Belinda comes seconds away from being convinced to unknowingly transfer her money into a fake account.

Barnett is undercover in Ghana, where he finds evidence of children as young as 10 working in poor conditions. Phil Harrison It’s Joe Lycett’s first full series as the Travel Man, and he’s taking the amiably awkward James Acaster to Bilbao and San Sebastián. They spend most of their time making satisfied noises while sampling local delicacies including kalimotxo (red wine and cola), pintxos (fancy bar snacks), oxtail sandwiches and the Basque take on tuna mayo. HR It has been a powerful run for this adaptation of Graham Norton’s novel and it’s time to find out who killed Tommy Burke.

Movies Mark Romanek doesn’t make many features – he’s mostly known as a music video director for the likes of Beyoncé and Jay-Z – so any film by him is to be cherished. This thriller, shot in a striking range of colour palettes, features Robin Williams in arguably his best performance. He plays Sy, a technician at a photo kiosk who prints snaps for the public, including Connie Nielsen’s Nina. Loner Sy idolises Nina’s seemingly perfect family – he stalks them by making furtive copies of her prints – so when he discovers a dark secret about them his vicarious pleasure is shattered. Williams is chilling here, with an unnerving stillness that belies his inner unhappiness. Simon Wardell Monsters (Gareth Edwards, 2010) 7.15pm, AMC The borderlands of the US and Mexico have been “infected” by huge, octopus-like aliens and are now a war-torn no-go zone. This proves a problem for photojournalist Andrew (Scoot McNairy) when he is ordered to chaperone his boss’s daughter Sam (Whitney Able) back to the US. In Gareth Edwards’s inventive, low-budget sci-fi drama, their perilous journey through the detritus of conflict has an air of reportage. The leads’ chemistry (they were a couple at the time) only adds to the empathy. SW Sweet Country (Warwick Thornton, 2018) 11.50pm, Film4 Warwick Thornton’s unhurried, beautiful drama explores colonial attitudes and Indigenous Australian life in the outback after the first world war. Hamilton Morris plays Sam, a worker on a farm run by the considerate Fred (Sam Neill). Other white landowners are more racially antagonistic, and Sam and wife Lizzie (Natassia Gorey-Furber) end up going on the run, pursued by Bryan Brown’s copper.

4/4/2022,"To say I’m excited is an understatement. Shane MacGowan, the reclusive former Pogue, has agreed to an interview. MacGowan has not talked to a British newspaper for 10 years and there is so much to ask him, not least how he is still alive. MacGowan, a brilliant lyricist and songwriter at his peak, drank and drugged himself to the point of destruction 40-odd years ago. Fans have feared for news of the inevitable ever since. But amazingly he’s still with us, living in Ireland with his journalist wife, Victoria Mary Clarke, and about to publish a gigantic book of his art, handwritten lyrics and school essays. Dublin, here I come! A few days before the interview, I receive a message from Victoria. “If you can be here for a few days, you will have more of a chance of getting him in a good mood!” Ah. MacGowan is almost as famous for his irascibility as for his music. A few days in Dublin sounds lovely, but impractical. I apologise to Victoria, and tell her I can only do the Friday as arranged. On the Wednesday, I get another message from her. “Just to warn you, he is very depressed and anxious.” MacGowan always gave the impression nothing bothered him – he would say what he liked when he liked to whom he liked. Anxiety was the last thing you associated with him. And yet he has said he had his first breakdown aged six and suffered with depression through much of his life. I get into Dublin about 10am. Victoria says Shane will be in bed till at least noon and agrees to meet me at the hotel close to their home. She drives up in their ancient battered green Merc. Victoria is a youthful 55-year-old with emerald green eyes. Everything is green in MacGowan’s life. She and MacGowan, 64, have been together on and off (much more on than off) for 35 years. We go for a coffee and a walk along the beach close to their house. It’s a beautiful day, and Victoria is as sunny as the weather. She grew up in the Irish countryside with hippy parents (an Irish mother and English stepfather), whereas MacGowan lived in London with his Irish parents and spent the school holidays on his maternal grandparents’ family farm in Tipperary. Victoria first met him in a pub in Temple Fortune, north London, when she was 16 and he was 24. He was with fellow Pogue Spider Tracey and told her she had to buy Spider a drink because it was his birthday. She told him to fuck off. But she was mesmerised. Back then he was phenomenally creative, held a room as soon as he walked in, drank for fun rather than out of necessity, and was a sex symbol despite the rotting teeth and Jumbo ears. When their friend Johnny Depp suggested that having children would be the making of them, she told him they were too irresponsible. “I said the thing is, if we had children, Shane would probably set fire to them. I was terrified Shane was going to burn down the house because he was always dropping his cigarettes. He set fire to John Belushi’s bungalow at Chateau Marmont.” The young MacGowan was a proud contrarian – he could happily wear a union jack jacket and have IRA tattooed across his head at the same time. As for the Pogues, they created a unique brand of riotous punk-folk. MacGowan’s songs were short stories that referenced literature, music, Gaelic mythology and the Bible. There were songs of yearning (A Pair of Brown Eyes), of exile (Fairytale of New York), of protest (Streets of Sorrow/Birmingham Six), and covers that were even better than the originals (Dirty Old Town). For a few brief years in the 1980s, the Pogues (originally called Pogue Mahone, the anglicisation of the Gaelic póg mo thóin, meaning “kiss my arse”) were wonderful. Victoria says he has changed hugely since then, as has their relationship. They are closer than ever, she still finds him funny and fascinating, but she is as much a carer as a partner these days. MacGowan uses a wheelchair and has to be hoisted out of bed by the official carer. In 2016 he fell and broke his pelvis. Then he had a fall on his Zimmer frame and broke his right knee. And another fall, this time tearing the ligaments in his left knee. He has never recovered. In some ways, Victoria says, she would have liked to have had a more normal life. “More domestic. I’m someone who likes to keep the place quite clean.” MacGowan was known for living in filth and never bathing. “He still doesn’t have baths. He showers very occasionally.” How does he smell? “He smells fine. But he wasn’t into making the place look nice.” Victoria is extraordinarily open. She talks about her relationship with MacGowan; relationships with other musicians whom she would rather I didn’t mention who wanted to marry her; how she had longed to be famous then hated being the Wag of a pop star and realised she wouldn’t have found fame much fun; how she suffered from addiction to drinks and drugs just as much as MacGowan did but has come out of it healthier than he has. She looks at her watch. It’s almost 2.30pm. She sounds anxious. “I said we’d be back at 2pm.” So we head to MacGowan Mansions, which is actually a flat on a modest gated estate. She gives him a kiss and apologises for being late. He is watching a Clint Eastwood film. He spends a lot of his time watching movies and TV. In some ways, MacGowan looks better than he used to. His new teeth are perfect, his hair is in great nick and his waxy skin is flawless, even though it doesn’t seem to have seen sunlight in years. In other ways he looks terrible – old, immobile, saggy. He sits on his green armchair, dressed in black, with a long silver crucifix hanging from his neck as if auditioning for the priest in a Dracula movie. On the walls are pictures, some drawn by Victoria, some by him. Above the fireplace is a crowded pew of religious icons. Victoria heads off to make a drink. I introduce myself, and ask how he is. “I can’t walk any more,” he says. Does he still use the wheelchair? “Yeah, that’s how I travel about.” “Did you have a pleasant chat around the hotel?” MacGowan somehow manages to make the question sound sinister. It was never easy to understand his slur, but now his words are so slow and indistinct they merge into one. He still has a presence – though a rather sad one. Victoria returns with a mug of tea for me and a tall glass of gin and tonic for him. Mainly tonic – she says he doesn’t drink so much since his accidents. “We went for a walk,” I say. “It was lovely.” “Yeah,” she says. “We went to the beach.” “Oh, right,” he says. “I didn’t snog him,” she says out of nowhere. “Or shag him.” “I didn’t accuse you,” he says. “No, I know. I’m just saying,” she says. “Chhhhhhhhhhhhhh.” His laugh sounds like a snore. “I’m too old,” I say, unsure how to respond. “How old are you?” he asks. “Fifty-nine,” I say. “I’ve done older!” she says. “That’s not very old.” They both laugh. “That’s not very old,” he confirms. “I was really old in my 30s, but I’m much younger now than I was,” Victoria says. He starts singing My Backpages. “I was so much older then / I’m younger than that now.” MacGowan can still hold a tune. “What’s that Bob Dylan one about being young?” she asks. “That was a Bob Dylan song,” he says. “What’s the other one, then?” “Well, he did a few, didn’t he?” He sniffs. “Forever Young – that one’s also Bob Dylan.” “Oh yeah,” he says, slurping his gin incredibly loudly. Victoria brings in bound collections of his art, much of which is in the new book, The Eternal Buzz and the Crock of Gold. There is an introduction from the art critic Waldemar Januszczak, praising MacGowan’s “demented, wild, fascinating, scabrous kind of energy”, particularly the Catholic and sexual imagery, and saying that he is one of the few pop star artists Januszczak admires. The pictures were mainly drawn, in ballpoint pen or felt tip, when he was on the road and off his head. They reflect his character – punky, spiky, rude, religious, funny, surreal, half-arsed, filthy. Many are so densely cross-hatched they are virtually scrubbed out. Victoria points out a picture of Bono as Lord Edward Fitzgerald, leader of the 1798 United Irish rebellion. Why did you turn Bono into Fitzgerald, I ask. “I don’t remember.” “You did these when you were totally wasted,” she says. “Yeah.” It’s hard to get anything beyond a monosyllable from MacGowan. In between there are long silences. He makes it clear he doesn’t want to talk. “You’ve got lovely skin, Shane,” I say, randomly. “Oh thanks sweety, Chhhhhhhhhhhhhh.” He snore-laughs. “Let’s see some of the filth, then,” I say. “The filth!” he repeats, possibly affronted. “Erotic art,” Victoria says. “Well, filth is a better word. Chhhhhhhhhhhhhh.” We look at various pictures – a woman with huge nipples smoking a cigar, an array of penises, penetration, fellatio, upside down S&M crucifixions, the works. Have you got a favourite, I ask. “Not really, no.” His short stubby sentences sound so weak they could be dying breaths. They are quickly followed by robust slurps of gin. One of my favourite pictures is a martini with an eye for the olive and a syringe for the stick. It reminds me of the Buñuel film, I say – what’s it called? “Un Chien Andalou. There’s one shot in it of an eyeball getting sliced with a razor. I would say this is more Dalí. Schhhhhhlrrrrp.” I ask if he is still writing songs. “No. I’ve got a block.” The truth is he has had a block since the late 1980s. “You wrote one a few weeks ago, didn’t you?” Victoria says encouragingly. Silence. Was it good, I ask? He has been recording with the Irish indie band Cronin. He looks at her, despairingly, wishing the conversation, or me, away. “I thought it was good,” she says. “Shane, is there anything you’d like to talk about?” “Not really, no. Chhhhhhhhhhhhhh.” I’ve always been fascinated by the mix of Irish and English influences on MacGowan. His father did a degree in economics, and had a successful career working in management for C&A in London. Shane was a bright kid, and excelled at English. His writing won him a scholarship to the top public school Westminster, though he was expelled at 14 for selling drugs. He suffered another breakdown and spent six months in psychiatric hospital, including his 18th birthday. When he was released he found a new purpose in punk. In 1976, he achieved a level of pre-fame fame when the NME featured a photo of him bleeding from his ear under the headline “Cannibalism at Clash gig” after was bitten by his friend Jane Crockford (later of the post-punk band Mo-dettes) at a concert at the ICA in London. Did living in England made him feel more Irish? “I didn’t live in England,” he protests. OK, did living in England most of the time make you feel more Irish? “Yes.” Why? He looks at Victoria despairingly. “God, these questions are fucking …” “There’s nothing I can do,” she says to him gently. “You’re going to just have to say something about something. Do you want me to close the curtains? The sun seems to be bugging you.” Victoria leaves the room to talk to the carer. “Victoria said you had bad anxiety yesterday,” I say. “How are you feeling now?” “Yes, I had a sudden attack of horrible fear. Nameless fear.” He softens. I’ve had that, I say – it’s paralysing, and makes you loathe yourself because it’s so pointless. “Well, that’s you. You’re projecting.” He’s got a point. For all his cussedness, MacGowan is still fantastically sharp. Despite his hostility, he’s got a lovely smile, which he occasionally lets me see. Victoria told me you like the royal family and cried when Prince Philip died, I say. “Noooo!” he says, outraged. “You know you like the royal family,” she says. “She likes the royal family.” And you? “I’ve got nothing against them.” “You watch The Crown a lot!” she says. “I watched the first series.” “You’re lying now. You watched all of it.” “I can’t remember, you know.” Does he miss being on the road? “Not really, no. I miss the early days of the Pogues. That was a lot of fun.” What are your best memories? He gives her another “Oh God” look. Were you aware of how creative you were back then? “Yes.” I remind him of something he once said – that in his songwriting he wanted to remind people of how rich Irish culture was, so they would return to the literature of the land and be proud of what such a small country had produced. Silence. If Waiting for Godot was the play in which nothing happened twice, this is the interview in which nothing happened 200 times. And yet, weirdly, I feel I’m beginning to understand him. Critics of the Pogues complained that they weren’t properly Irish. But that was to miss the point. MacGowan was writing about the experience of being a London Irishman, a Paddy. He wrote about the discrimination the Irish faced in Britain, Republican politics and miscarriages of justices. He made many young Irish people born in Britain to Irish parents feel proud of their Irishness for the first time. He reclaimed the racist Paddy stereotype and embraced it (even if he ultimately reinforced it). Many of the songs were about being drunk, and he said he was never going to fake it onstage, so he was pretty much permanently pissed. Then he discovered heroin. He only got clean in 2000 after Sinéad O’Connor dobbed him into the police with the blessing of Victoria. I ask how he feels about the Pogues’ most famous song, Fairytale of New York, being voted the UK’s most popular Christmas song in 2019. “It pisses me off when people always talk about it,” he says. Why? “Cos. Cos it just pisses me off, all right?” Have you got a favourite song? “I’ve got a few, but that’s not one of them” Which ones? “I said I’ve got a few” “He said which ones?” Victoria says. “Oh, stop.” I love A Pair of Brown Eyes, I say. It’s one of many that come to mind. “White City I like a lot. No, not A Pair of Brown Eyes.” You don’t like that? “No.” In 1991, the Pogues sacked MacGowan from the band even though he by and large was the band. He had become too unreliable. He formed the Popes, which was little more than a Pogues tribute band. The Pogues split up in 1996, reformed in 2001 with MacGowan and finally split up again in 2014. They didn’t record any new music second time round. I ask how he fills his days now. Are you listening to much? “Not really, no.” Are you reading? “No, not really.” The story, possibly apocryphal, is that, by the age of 10, MacGowan was reading James Joyce’s Ulysses. Is it true? “Ten, 11 or 12,” he says. “It’s the anniversary this year. My dad was very into that, and he got me into it. My mother read a lot as well.” Do you think people were right to refer to you as a genius? “Probably, yeah.” What made you a genius? “God! Fucking ridiculous question!” In the 2020 Julien Temple documentary Crock of Gold, the former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams visits MacGowan and they reminisce (well, Adams does) about their long friendship. On the eve of peace talks with then prime minister Tony Blair, MacGowan asked him to pass on the message: “Tiocfaidh ár lá” (“Our day will come”). Do you see much of Adams? “No. He’s been here a few times. He’s a very easy person to talk to,” he says pointedly. “The priest comes round,” Victoria says buoyantly. “That happens regularly. He talks a lot.” “Yeah, he talks a hell of a lot.” I’m staring at the icons on the mantelpiece. Have you always had faith? “I was brought up with it, you know.” Have you ever lost it? “Yes, a few times.” Because of stuff that has happened? “I don’t know.” Does your faith get stronger as you get older? Silence. Victoria brings out some more art – cartoon characters called Bim and Dim. Did you like cartoons as a kid, I ask. Silence. “You did like cartoons,” Victoria says, exasperated, “You did!” Silence. “Shane, you definitely liked cartoons. I know you did. You liked the Phantom.” “Yeah,” he finally concedes. “Shane, you’re looking at him as if he’s here to kill you or torture you, but he’s not. He’s here cos he’s interested. And he’s trying his best. Come on – you’re not making it easy.” Do you hate talking in general or just interviews, I ask. “Just interviews.” Why? “After the first album we were totally misinterpreted.” In what way? “In what way was I misinterpreted?” He looks at Victoria. Now I’m beginning to feel sorry for him. He seems on the verge of despair. “That’s a fair question,” Victoria says. “It wasn’t just me – it was the group.” But they were only interested in you? “Yes. It turned into that.” And you didn’t like that? “Yes.” It was undemocratic? “I just told you: I don’t like it.” I’m just asking why, I say. “I don’t know why I don’t like certain things. Schhhhhhlrrrrp.” Did journalists misinterpret you when they said you had a death wish? He nods. “I still don’t.” Contrary to popular belief, you actually like life? “Yes!” he explodes passionately. “Of course I like life.” “That’s not always a given,” Victoria says. “Well, I like life!” he says adamantly. “I don’t always like life,” Victoria says. Has she ever not wanted to live? “Yes, quite a lot of the time. But Shane never seems to want not to live. That’s what’s weird.” Is life good, I ask him. “I’m working at it,” he says. I have a feeling it’s fear of death more than love of life that keeps him going. Pretend I’m not here; would you say you were in a good place? “Yes. Yes!” Will you be happy when I’ve gone? “Probably, yeah, Chhhhhhhhhhhhhh. You’ve worn me out, Si.” Victoria shows me what the book will look like when it’s finished. It’s huge and incredibly heavy. They are publishing 1,000 copies at £1,000 each. She told me earlier that they need money for his care. I ask him if he worries about money. “It’s important when you haven’t got it.” Did you not earn as much as you should have done in the first place or have you spent it all? Silence. “That may be a personal question,” Victoria says. “Sweetpea, are you going to say anything helpful for the book?” She looks at me. “I’ll probably have to go quite soon.” Silence. “Look, it’s a picture book,” he eventually says. “That’s all there is to it. People seem to like the pictures.” She goes to put on her coat. “You’ve been pretty reckless with drink and drugs,” I say. “Have you had any regrets about how you’ve lived your life before? “Of course!” Another passionate explosion. “She’s done a great job,” he says suddenly. He’s talking about how Victoria has put the book together, but he could just as well be talking about everything else she’s done for him. “Put that in,” she says, delighted. “Put that in.” Does he think he would still be here without her? A heavy pause, even by his standards. “She lights up my life,” he says from the heart. “I definitely want to help him to stay alive for as long as possible,” Victoria says. She heads towards the door, waiting to give me a lift back into town. “Shane,” I say, “I’d like to say it’s been a pleasure, but it’s not been the easiest.” “Chhhhhhhhhhhhhh,” he snore-laughs in agreement. “Why don’t I take a picture of the two of you together?” Victoria says from the door. “No thanks,” we both say simultaneously, smiling at each other. It’s impossible not to warm to him when he smiles like that – however horribly he has treated you. Take care, I say. “God bless,” he says.

4/4/2022,"The public do not believe ministers’ promises to tackle crime, official documents seen by the Guardian show. The Home Office documents reveals polling carried out for the government found a high fear of crime, and low confidence much will be done about it. The leak reveals the public are not convinced by a series of flagship initiatives by Boris Johnson’s administration on law on order, such as the Beating Crime plan. It comes despite government efforts to distance themselves from a decade of Conservative cuts to the police and the criminal justice system. Only one in three of those polled had faith it could tackle crime, its own document notes: “Current initiatives to tackle crime are not cutting through to the public – only around a third (35%) say they have confidence in the government’s handling of crime and justice, and awareness of the Beating Crime Plan is low.” The document, called Home Office Violence Reduction Unit Communications Strategy, dates from March and contains polling from February. Boris Johnson has trumpeted his anti-crime credentials but the government’s own polling, taken after weeks of furore over “partygate” and government untruths, shows the public were disbelieving. Johnson has been keen to claim that under his government crime has been falling, falsely claiming in February that it had decreased by 14%. The statistics watchdog rebuked him, finding it had been presented the figures in a misleading way. The Home office document says: “While crime isn’t necessarily the most ‘top-of-mind’ concern for the public, it’s a constant undercurrent and, when asked, people feel very strongly about it. “Our most recent polling (conducted Feb 2022) shows that 61% think that crime is going up nationally, and 51% are worried about becoming a victim of crime.”“ The document adds: “Perceptions of crime and levels of concern are largely driven by anecdotal experiences and high-profile media cases. At a national level, the public are particularly concerned about violent crime such as knife crime and people using/dealing drugs and can point to examples in their own lives or the news that back up these worries.” The document shows the damage the Conservatives did to their reputation on law and order by slashing police numbers by 20,000. The cuts from 2010 continue to reverberate with voters. “Concerns are exacerbated by a perceived lack of deterrents (eg lack of police resources, inconsistent sentencing) for perpetrators of crime,” the document says. It also notes a generational divide in how to tackle crime, with younger people more willing to tackle underlying causes of offending and give people a second chance, while older people back a more traditional approach of high sentences and prison: “However, there are some differences in opinion over the most appropriate approach to tackling crime, with younger groups tending to favour rehabilitation and older adults leaning towards a more punitive approach.” The planned response to lack of public confidence planned by ministers is not any policy changes, but a public relations campaign to convince voters the government can tackle crime. In a section on communications objectives, it says it wants to boost the numbers of those believing police “have the funding and resources they need”. Currently the government is funding 20,000 new officers, to replace those cut by the Conservatives, and is on track to meet its promise. Other objectives set out in the document to boost public opinion of the government includes getting increased agreement “government is taking action to tackle crime”, dealing with the causes and “increased confidence in the government’s handling of crime and justice”. Labour’s home affairs spokesperson, Yvette Cooper, told the Guardian: “Crime is up, prosecutions have plummeted, criminals are getting off and victims and communities are being let down. “The Conservatives are completely failing in the basic tasks of any government – to keep communities safe and deliver justice. That’s why people don’t have confidence in the Conservative government on crime. “If Priti Patel’s response to this incredibly serious problem is a PR campaign that is a total disgrace and shows just how out of touch she is with the realities of people’s lives.” The Home Office declined a request for comment. The pandemic has affected some crime trends. The Office for National Statistics said comparing the year ending September 2021, to the year ending September 2019, there was a 14% increase in total crime, with fraud and computer misuse rocketing by 47%. If fraud and computer misuse is excluded, crime fell 14%, with theft decreasing by 18%. Richard Garside, the director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, said low conviction rates and partygate were sapping confidence in the government’s competence on crime. He said: “A government seemingly indifferent to obeying its own rules should hardly be surprised if many members of the public don’t have confidence in its approach to crime.”",News/UK news,"UK public do not believe government will tackle crime, documents show",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/04/uk-public-do-not-believe-government-will-tackle-crime-documents-show
4/4/2022,"From the pandemic and the war in Ukraine to the Westminster partygate saga, newspapers are benefiting from a financially lucrative news boom. However, is the news industry enjoying a one-off blip in the battle for survival against big tech, or is this proof that publishers have finally forged commercial models fit for the new media age? In a sign of the shifting fortunes amid unprecedented news events, Rupert Murdoch’s Times and Sunday Times last week reported a doubling of operating profits to their highest level since 1990 and the Sun, a one-time cash cow turned high-profile casualty of the digital age, is within £1m of returning to operating profit for the first time in a decade. The papers’ parent company, News Corporation, where executives have seen the market value double to $13bn (£9.9bn) since 2019, is the latest to reveal the significant financial boost thanks to news-hungry readers seeking trusted media outlets during uncertain times in record numbers. Other major news organisations are also enjoying a revival in fortunes. The New York Times hit its target of 10m subscriptions three years early, albeit in part thanks to spending $550m buying the sports news subscription service the Athletic, and its chief executive, Meredith Kopit Levien, said 2021 was its most profitable for many years. The news rush has helped the Financial Times and the Guardian to pass 1 million digital subscribers each, while the Telegraph has reached 750,000 print and digital combined, at an average spend per subscriber of £172. And last year Reach, the publisher of the Mirror and Express titles, as well as hundreds of regional brands including the Liverpool Echo and the Manchester Evening News, managed its first like-for-like revenue growth since 2007. “One of the knock-on effects of such an extraordinary news run is that it has given confidence back to the news industry that it has a role, a purpose and a community of people prepared to value it,” said Douglas McCabe, the chief executive of the research consultancy Enders Analysis. “Every conversation used to be about the battle with Google, but now heads are up. For the first time executives can see, imagine, and picture an online future.” Despite this, Google and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, remain fearsome competitors for ad spend. In 2022, the Silicon Valley giants will make more than £16bn in ad revenues in the UK, as much as 63% of the total market, according to eMarketer. Meanwhile, the UK national and newspaper digital and print ad market will be worth £1.5bn, according to WPP’s GroupM. However, the tectonic plates of the hitherto one-sided relationship have changed significantly. Regulatory and lobbying pressure on both sides of the Atlantic has focused on creating a fairer playing field. In countries including Australia, Canada, France and the US, collective bargaining by publishers to improve commercial negotiating terms with the online giants is either being allowed or is being considered by lawmakers. The European Union is pushing ahead with the Digital Markets Act and the UK’s competition regulator is setting up a digital markets unit, both of which are designed to crack down on the big tech firms and ensure fairer trading. News Corp has publicly said it reached deals worth “nine figures” annually, while Google and Facebook have pledged $1bn each over the next three years to pay publishers for news. “On the platforms we distribute our content on, we have to have a fair exchange of value,” said Dominic Carter, the executive vice-president and publisher of the Sun at News UK. “The value we create needs to be recognised and that is now increasingly the case with the platforms we have relationships with. They are not the saviours of our businesses, but the relationship we have is much more equal than it has been.” The inexorable decline of print has hastened during the pandemic – while also becoming significantly more costly as newsprint prices hit three-decade highs amid soaring inflation worldwide – with GroupM forecasting that across the UK newspaper and magazine market digital ad revenues will overtake print ad revenues by the end of next year. “While there will be businesses that either exit, shrink or reduce frequency of publication – there are a lot of weak players in general – there are those in a strong position that are going to do OK,” said Brian Wieser, the global president for business intelligence at GroupM. “The real trend that’s played out is those media owners that have benefited are more global, while the majority are tied to one market. It is better to be global than national, and national than local. Generally, strong publishers are coming out the other side, while the weaker continue to go.” During the pandemic the New York Times reported its best-ever year for digital revenues, while also notching up the milestone of digital surpassing print revenue for the first time in its 172-year history. In the final quarter last year, News Corporation said digital advertising income overtook print advertising at the Sun for the first time. Still, some analysts say this is less about the success of digital strategy and more about the parlous state of print advertising. Revenues are currently on course to collapse from £6bn in 1999 to £1.2bn by 2026, according to GroupM. “That digital is exceeding print is a positive not a negative for newspapers,” said Carter, who believed a platform for the future was now there for newspapers. “It is a sign of success in businesses that we know we are all transitioning. There is a rebalancing back towards quality, context and data – we have those at scale in newspapers.” But, he added: “Are we saved? I wouldn’t say any of us are completely out of the woods yet.”",News/Media,Will the news boom prevent more media outlets going bust? ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/04/will-the-news-boom-prevent-more-media-outlets-going-bust
4/4/2022,"A dozen senior Labour women have called on the party to end its use of confidentiality agreements to “cover up” allegations of sexual harassment, saying the treatment of two former staffers was appalling. Laura Murray, Labour’s ex-head of complaints, and Georgie Robertson, who worked in the party’s press office, said they refused to sign the agreements after reporting an official for “inappropriate” and “possessive” behaviour. Their lawyer argued the use of the contract violated Labour’s own policy on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). After the BBC revealed Murray and Robertson’s allegations, Labour was urged to apologise to them and stop offering confidentiality agreements to those who made accusations of sexual harassment. In a letter sent to the party and seen by the Guardian, seven women on its ruling national executive committee and five who are members of Labour’s national women’s committee said they were “appalled to see these reports”. “We can’t fight to end sexual harassment in society if we don’t also address it within our party,” they wrote to Labour’s general secretary, David Evans and chair Anneliese Dodds. “Trying to persuade women to sign NDAs to cover up abuse is a gross betrayal of Labour values and we call on our leadership to acknowledge its duty of care and its responsibility towards all women within the party, members and staffers and to end this practice, apologise to any women caught up in this victimisation and seek to offer them redress.” Of the seven NEC members who signed the letter, four were constituency party representatives – Nadia Jama, Yasmine Dar, Gemma Bolton and Ann Henderson – as well as trade union representative Andi Fox. The representatives of Young Labour – Lara McNeill – and disabled members – Ellen Morrison – also signed the letter. The five members of the Labour national women’s committee were vice-chair Ekua Bayunu, as well as Chloe Hopkins, Solma Ahmed, Tricia Duncan and Jean Sharrocks. They offered solidarity with Murray and Robertson and said the office of the party leader, Keir Starmer, should be “transparent in its attempts to change its culture and abide by the same rules about our code of conduct as is expected of the membership”. Labour denied it uses any non-disclosure agreements that would stop anyone speaking out about sexual harassment. A spokesperson said the party “takes any complaints of sexual harassment extremely seriously, which are fully investigated and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken in line with the party’s rules and procedures”. Zelda Perkins, a co-founder of the Can’t Buy My Silence group, which campaigns against the use of NDAs to gag victims, told the Guardian: “There is no place for an agreement with legal consequences that is hiding any form of poor behaviour. “It’s illogical on every level, particular in a political party when they’re meant to be practising transparency and good behaviour.” She added: “I applaud both of these women because they’ve done absolutely the right thing. Although they’ve essentially lost their jobs for choosing not to be gagged, they’ve kept their dignity, sanity and basic human right, which is to speak. “It’s inexcusable for the Labour party to be involved in this. They should know better and appear to have lost sight of the ethical and moral consequences of using NDAs.”",News/Politics,Labour women urge party not to use NDAs for sexual harassment allegations,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/04/labour-women-urge-party-not-to-use-ndas-for-sexual-harassment-allegations
4/4/2022,"One of the perennial fascinations with the night sky is that the planets are always changing their configuration against the backdrop of fixed constellations. Occasionally, however, this proves frustrating. Such is the case at the moment in the higher northern latitudes, where the naked-eye planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) are all skulking low in the sky. This makes observing them difficult but not impossible and so we will begin and end this month with two close planetary conjunctions that are worth the effort. The chart shows the view looking east-south-east from London on 5 April 2022 at 05.45 BST.

4/4/2022,"A new government-backed body set up to police the building industry faces claims that it lacks representation from architects, ordinary homeowners and BAME communities whose Covid-19 death rates have been linked to poor housing standards. Labour had claimed the New Home Quality Board [NHQB] lacked independence as it was chaired by a Tory MP and Conservative-linked developers sit on the board alongside her. On Friday it announced a new CEO and chair as it moved to what it described as its “full operational stage”. The body has published a code of practice for the housebuilding industry and is working to oversee the creation of the New Homes Ombudsman Service, due to launch in the Summer, with the stated aim of providing “robust independent redress” for new-build buyers who have “issues with their new home or developer”. However, the NHQB was criticised by Ben Derbyshire, a former president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, who questioned what he described as an “inexplicable absence of anyone with a design background or training on the board”. “Design in British housing, especially speculative mass housing, is generally very poor. The exceptions to this represent the minority of housebuilding and renovation but these exceptions should become the rule. Good housing architects are notably absent from housebuilding and that is never going to change so long the profession is not represented on the New Homes Quality Board,” he said. He expressed concern about the extent of representation of people from BAME communities on the board after the pandemic had showed up the correlation between poor housing standards, overcrowding, disadvantage and death from Covid among ethnic minorities. Cym D’Souza, a chief executive of Arawak Walton Housing Association, an organisation specialising in the needs of Black and minority ethnic communities, said: “What I would question, is how this board would have any lived experience – apart from perhaps Gillian Cooper of Citizens Advice, of what it is like for the ‘ordinary’ person to go up against large developers when they are unhappy with their homes and ultimately how the framework supports the building of new quality homes in this respect?” From April, the NHQB’s new CEO will be Leon Livermore who was formerly the chief executive of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) for eight years. Rob Brighouse, an engineer and Network Rail board member, has been named as the replacement for Natalie Elphicke MP, who had come under the spotlight for having a second job earning £3,000 a month for spending around eight hours a week as chair of the board. The HomeOwners Alliance – which has been particularly critical of the NHQB since it was launched in 2021 with support from the then housing minister, Robert Jenrick – said the new appointments were a step in the right direction. “Although on balance the board looks fairly one-sided as there are already at least four industry appointments, such as Taylor Wimpey,” added Paula Higgins, the HOA’s CEO. “What is missing from the board is the actual perspective of the buyers and owners of newly built properties. Who will be attending that has the ear of the consumer and who really understands the problems buyers face when buying and owning a new-build – from developers reneging on reservation agreements because of rising house prices, to poor quality after-care?” A spokesperson for the NHQB said it was set up with the specific objective of ensuring the homebuyers’ experience improves, adding that it was committed to delivering this and consumers will have access to free, independent redress through a new ombudsman. “The development of the code was subject to a full public consultation, and the appointment of the New Homes Ombudsman has been subject to full open procurement processes” they added. “The new board appointments have been made following a publicly advertised and professionally managed recruitment process, and include a mix of representatives from consumer bodies, housebuilders, warranty providers, lenders and independents, which ensures it will not be dominated by any one group. The Board is fully committed to diversity and inclusion and it continues to be central to recruitment decisions.”",News/Society,"Body set up to police UK housebuilding not representative, say critics",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/04/body-set-up-to-police-uk-housebuilding-not-representative-say-critics
4/4/2022,"It was the play that had critics searching for superlatives and audiences queueing out of the door. When Jerusalem opened at London’s Royal Court in 2009, it developed a near-mythical reputation almost instantly. And when it transferred to the West End and then on to Broadway, the legend was complete. Shaggy, rambunctiously comic and centred on Mark Rylance’s outsized performance as Johnny “Rooster” Byron, a Falstaffian ruffian dispensing drugs and tall tales to teenagers in the West Country woods, Jerusalem was a state-of-the-nation play in the strangest sense. It sets up a contemporary England half-drunk on history, where even Rooster’s hangers-on expect giants to rise up near the A14 – and not just because they’ve popped too many pills. Could any of this be real? Some even declared it “the play of the century”. To mark its return to the West End, six playwrights consider its power and legacy – and ask whether its titanic reputation still stands. I saw Jerusalem in previews, before the verdict came in that it was a historic piece of theatre. But you could tell even then: the way the audience reacted was completely joyous. There are all these epic themes, but it was also a huge amount of fun: a full and proper night out. I’ve spent a long time trying to understand its DNA. I’ve often used it as a text when working with emerging writers. For all that it’s so wild and sprawling, it’s very tightly constructed. There’s a linearity of time, uniformity of place, a set group of characters – it’s not quite Greek, but nearly. I love that Jez Butterworth, its writer, signposts the storytelling right at the start: you’ve got this guy living in a caravan in the woods, the council wants to evict him, and he says: “I’m not going.” You get the dramatic proposition, the tension, the conflict – all in the first couple of minutes. I’ve probably stolen that technique a bit. Best of Enemies explicitly signposts the end at the very beginning. A number of the scripts I’ve written have been about politics and the corridors of power. In Jerusalem, the politics are implicit not explicit, metaphorical not literal, and I really admire how bold Jez was with it: here’s this thing called “Jerusalem”, it’s a self-declared state-of-the-nation play, it’s about Englishness. It takes courage to do that. I got a Megabus really early in the morning from Bristol to see Jerusalem in London’s West End. I queued for tickets as early as I could. The only seat I could get was up in the gods, but then I got chatting to a lady whose friend hadn’t turned up, and she offered me a seat in her box. It was an incredible, delirious, unexpected day. The show made my body shake: the pounding noise of it, the energy of the performances. It was also thrilling to see on stage something from the West Country, which is still remarkably rare. As someone who grew up there, to me it felt really authentic: that self-deprecating sense of humour, the jokes about BBC Points West, a love for the countryside but also an acknowledgment of the smallness of that world. Should the play be revived? I’m not sure. I read the script again recently and there’s a lot that feels dated: the laddish chat about “birds” and the racial references – will they change those or at least acknowledge them? I understand it’s a safe bet for producers, this big, much-loved hit – and I loved it too. But at a time when theatre is grappling with questions of diversity and representation after Black Lives Matter, and when we’re seeing the rise of nationalism post-Brexit, doing a play about defending homeland and Englishness seems ill-judged. Maybe they’ll be able to interrogate that, or give it context, but I’m not sure. So much has changed. I had just graduated from acting school and moved to New York. There was all this buzz about this British play that had landed on Broadway. Everyone seemed to be talking about it, in particular Mark Rylance’s performance as Rooster Byron. So we bought tickets. I was determined to be an actor at the time, and was mainly looking at it through that sort of lens: “How’s he doing that, what’s he doing with his body?” It was otherworldly, the way Rylance transformed himself into this extraordinary muscular force. You see a lot of remarkable performances in New York, but this was something else. I remember listening to his acceptance speech after he won a Tony for best actor – and here was this lovely, rather sweet, small man, not this giant, epic thing I saw on stage. He thanked his chiropractor. I think I understand why. As someone who didn’t grow up in England, I’m sure some of the references went over my head. But what appealed to me was this sense of its world being so complete. And its characters felt universal. I remember being totally along for the ride. I never saw Jerusalem the first time around – I couldn’t get a ticket – so I bought the text and read it. What struck me was how lyrical and beautiful the writing was: poetic, dense, multilayered. Then there’s the fascinating question of Rooster and what kind of character he is: we see him as the ultimate outsider, existing on the margins, but we’re also deeply drawn to him. I wish I’d been able to see Rylance’s performance to figure out how – or if – he resolved that. The play is packed with symbols of Englishness, from St George’s Day to maypoles to Spitfires. Some reviewers fondly alluded to Rooster as a metaphor for a lost England – a decaying man, a decaying empire. But, as someone who grew up in Britain in a leftwing Asian family, empire is not something I have any nostalgia for. The drama has also been hailed as the definitive English play in the modern canon. While it’s necessary to ask, “What or who is England?”, I don’t think there’s a single answer. There are many Englands. Much as I’d like to finally see it, I wonder if, instead of just reviving Jerusalem with the same director and some of the same cast, a more interesting approach would be for someone to write a new play responding to it. Where is Rooster now? What happened to the female characters, who we don’t hear a lot from? How have they all navigated Brexit and Covid? That could be fascinating. I was working on a project at the Royal Court when Jerusalem was in rehearsals, and there was something in the air – a sense that something really exciting was being created. One day I was having a cigarette with one of the crew, a guy called Stick who’d been building the set, and he said: “You absolutely have to see this.” I ended up going six times. I made everyone I knew go, even people who never went to the theatre. I was a fairly inexperienced writer at the time – my second play, Tusk Tusk, had just been staged – and I learned so much from the script. I didn’t realise that you could be epic and grand, but also funny and up-to-date. There’s all that stuff about myths and Englishness, but there’s banter, and gags about Girls Aloud. Jez is such a generous writer: even minor characters get their riffs and arias. And then the climax, the scene where Rooster is drumming, incanting the names of spirits and ghosts! As a writer, if you can create that kind of energy, it’s the holy grail. I think it’s also worth saying that the director Ian Rickson, who I’ve worked with subsequently, is so important, both in the way he worked with Jez to help bring it into existence and the way it appeared on stage. He’s a proper writers’ director. Jerusalem wasn’t tidy, it wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t commercial. It was sprawling and wild and dangerous – and I felt completely lit up by it. If you see a handful of plays like that in your lifetime, you’re doing well. Jerusalem is old-fashioned in the best ways: it’s got this big three-act structure, two intervals, three hours-plus. Hardly anyone does that any more. At first you think: “Oh, this is a sort of pastoral comedy.” But then the momentum builds and it turns into this epic state-of-the-nation play. The confidence and craft of that is so impressive. Jez – whom I’ve never met – is a hugely talented writer, absolutely no question. And Rylance was definitive. It’s immensely rare for one of the greatest actors of their generation to connect with a piece of new writing: it felt like you were watching Laurence Olivier play The Entertainer [by John Osborne] or Anthony Hopkins do Pravda [by David Hare and Howard Brenton]. However, I did sense odd things, too, as much in the audience reaction as anything else. When I saw it at the Royal Court during that initial run, it was summer 2009. Gordon Brown was in power and you could sense that it was the end of the New Labour era. Something was changing. That image in Jerusalem of the spirit of England being under threat from busybodies and petty bureaucrats – that England has got befuddled and stoned, is living in its caravan in the woods, but will rise to its feet and conquer once more – that seemed to do something to the audience. We were in central London, but it was like being in the middle of a Countryside Alliance rally. As I left, I thought: “The Tories are going to win the next election.” Jerusalem is at the Apollo theatre, London, 16 April-17 August.",Arts/Stage,Is Jerusalem the play of the century?

4/4/2022,"Teenage pop phenom Olivia Rodrigo and R&B duo Silk Sonic dominated the major categories, and Jon Batiste won album of the year at the 64th annual Grammys – a three-and-a-half-hour mega concert that mostly steered clear of politics or the pandemic, save for a virtual message from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and an emotional tribute to victims of the Russian invasion. A week after one of the most chaotic Oscars in recent memory – during which Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on stage – the Grammys seemed to revel in its technical proficiency and lack of controversy. “We’re gonna be listening to some music, we’re gonna be dancing, we’re gonna be singing, we’re gonna be keeping people’s names out of our mouths,” said host Trevor Noah in his opening monologue, acknowledging the elephant in the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. “Don’t even think of it as an awards show,” said Noah, who returned to the Grammys stage after emceeing last year’s Covid-straitened ceremony. “This is a concert where we give out awards.” Indeed, after years of controversy over the recording academy’s lack of diversity, recognition of hip-hop or inclusion of female artists, the 2022 Grammys mostly stuck to the music, with only nine televised awards in what was essentially a revue of two years in popular music. Noah acted as an amiable, enthusiastic hype man with a handful of light quips on Covid vaccines (last year “people were doing shots, but it was more Moderna and Pfizer”) and NFTs (“You know it’s been rough when your favorite artists go from trying to sell you music to trying to sell you pictures of digital monkeys”). He struck a more serious note halfway through the ceremony, introducing Zelenskiy: “Even in the darkest times, music has the power to lift spirits and give you hope for a brighter tomorrow. There’s nobody who could use a little hope right now more than the people of Ukraine.” In a pre-filmed video, a noticeably hoarse Zelenskiy cast music as an embodiment of peace and freedom. “The war. What is more opposite to music?” he said. “The silence of ruined cities and killed people. Our children draw swooping rockets, not shooting stars. “The war doesn’t let us choose who survives and who stays in eternal silence,” he continued. “Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos. They sing to the wounded in hospitals, even to those who can’t hear them. But the music will break through anyway.” Zelenskiy praised his countrymen (“We defend our freedom. To live. To love. To sound. On our land, we are fighting Russia which brings horrible silence with its bombs. The dead silence. Fill the silence with your music! Fill it today to tell our story”) and urged Grammy viewers to publicly support Ukraine. “I have a dream of them living,” he said of the Ukrainian people. “And free. Free like you on the Grammy stage.” The message served as an introduction to a John Legend performance of Free, along with Ukrainian musicians Mika Newton and Siuzanna Iglidan, and Ukrainian poet Lyuba Yakimchuk. In his second year as executive producer of the Grammys, taking over after Ken Ehrlich’s 40-year tenure, Ben Winston mostly allowed individual artists to shine. Rodrigo, who took home best new artist and best pop vocal album for Sour, sang her record-smashing breakout hit Drivers License from behind the wheel of a vintage Mercedes, with a full American suburban street set. no thoughts head empty just olivia rodrigo singing her grammy winning song at the #GRAMMYs 🥲 pic.twitter.com/yxN4GRNk3z Brandi Carlile drew a standing ovation for Right on Time, an operatic ballad of regret and second chances. New York-bred rap legend Nas – “your rapper’s favorite rapper,” as Noah introduced him – performed a medley of hits (and also drew a standing ovation from the crowd, including Lil Nas X). Lady Gaga paid tribute to long-time friend and collaborator Tony Bennett, who retired from live performances last year at the age of 95 on doctor’s order (Bennett has lived with Alzheimer’s for several years, he revealed). Jon Batiste, the night’s most-nominated artist with 11 nods, kicked off a sprightly, retro-futurist performance of Freedom with a dramatic, starkly lit piano solo. In a self-conscious nod to the Academy’s reputational woes – which has led artists such as the Weeknd and Frank Ocean to snub the awards entirely – new president Harvey Mason Jr promised “at the new Recording Academy, we serve music” in a video message. The show celebrated live music producers – the behind-the-scenes workers who helped bring live concerts back from pandemic closures – by inviting some to introduce their artists. Road tour manager Misha Hedman Mayes introduced HER, whom she has known since the R&B star was just 11 years old. Wardrobe supervisor Joan Lee pitched her collaborator and boss, Carrie Underwood, who won best roots gospel album for My Savior. Tour manager Nicole Massey, who shouted out to all “women in touring”, set the stage for “the best 20-year-old boss in the world”, Billie Eilish, who performed a rain-soaked rendition of Happier Than Ever. Eilish’s brother/producer Finneas accompanied her on guitar, wearing a shirt honoring Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, who died unexpectedly last week at age 50 while on tour in Colombia. Noah also acknowledged Hawkins, who was supposed to perform with the Foo Fighters at the ceremony. The remembrance kicked off the night’s In Memoriam segment: Dear Evan Hansen star Ben Platt, Wicked’s Cynthia Erivo, Hamilton’s Leslie Odom Jr and West Side Story’s Rachel Zegler sang a medley of songs by the late musical theater titan Stephen Sondheim, who died last November at 91. Amid all the music, there were a handful of lighthearted speeches. “I have never taken such a fast piss in my whole life,” said Doja Cat, who apparently rushed from the bathroom to the stage to accept the award for best pop duo performance with SZA, for Kiss Me More. “I like to downplay shit,” she said through tears, “but this is a big deal.” Silk Sonic, AKA Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, grooved on to the stage for both record and song of the year. “We are really trying our hardest to remain humble at this point,” Anderson .Paak quipped. “Drinks is on Silk Sonic tonight!” Jon Batiste closed the evening with, fittingly, a celebration of music for album of the year. “I believe this to my core: there is no best musician, best artist, best dancer, best actor,” he said. “The creative arts are subjective and they reach people at a point in their lives when they need it most.”",Arts/Music,Grammy awards 2022: Olivia Rodrigo wins big and Ukraine’s Zelenskiy makes cameo,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/04/grammy-awards-2022-olivia-rodrigo-wins-big-and-ukraines-zelenskiy-makes-cameo
4/4/2022,"Soon after the first chiffchaffs arrived, I visited one of the most secret places in Dorset. It was a lost lane, overgrown with a hedge the width of a cottage, on a “half-moon of low rabbit-cropped hills” overlooking the Marshwood Vale. Here, in Geoffrey Household’s 1939 thriller Rogue Male, a political assassin goes to ground after failing to kill Hitler. Hunted like an animal, he digs into the bank of a sunken trackway, burrowing into the soft, sandy foxmould (a type of sandstone) to create a cramped den beneath a patch of bramble and sloe. Household gives a detailed description of the location, but most readers have presumed it to be an imaginative mix of local features rather than an actual place. Or it has been suggested that it was one of the nearby holloways, paths worn deep into the landscape by generations of packhorses carrying goods inland from the sea. For 30 years I had assumed likewise. I was startled when a friend who knows the area intimately said that they had researched old maps and found the specific lane. They offered to take me there. Our mission began in the hamlet of Lower Denhay, a cluster of stone and thatch buildings lodged at the base of a steep hill. We took a footpath up to the ridge, passing through a small wood where the ground was splashed with clumps of wild primrose, yellow-green beside the slick, buttery gold of celandines. The hideout was about halfway up, hard to spot under a swamping blanket of what Household calls “sentinel thorns”. Part of the original bank had eroded, its only trace a bump on the trunk of a veteran ash marking the original soil level. You might, as the hero intended, walk past and not realise it was there. Peering into the tangle of bare stems and dead wood, I saw old lines of barbed wire and a corrugated plastic sheet, green with algae. The area beyond would make a claustrophobic refuge, exactly as Household described. I was convinced this was the site that inspired Household, a corner so damp and dark that, as he wrote, “nobody but an adventurous child” – or someone in fear of their life – would explore it.
