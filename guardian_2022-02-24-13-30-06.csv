2/24/2022,"Ben Roberts-Smith told another soldier “I just want to kill cunts” while on deployment in Afghanistan, and had pictures of slain insurgents on an iPod during training, the federal court has heard. A former SAS soldier, now an officer still serving in the Australian Defence Force, was subpoenaed to give evidence to Roberts-Smith’s defamation hearing this week. He was anonymised before the court as Person Two.  Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times over reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. Person Two was a witness for the newspapers. He told the court he was posted alongside Roberts-Smith on “picket duty” in a big bunker area during deployment in Afghanistan in 2006. Person Two said Roberts-Smith told him: “I just want to kill cunts. I don’t give a fuck, I just want to kill cunts.” Person Two also testified that sitting on a bus following a parachute training course in Australia, Roberts-Smith pulled out an iPod, leaned over the seat of another soldier, and said “hey check this out”. He then allegedly showed the other soldiers photographs of “dead insurgents” on the device. Person Two was a member of Roberts-Smith’s patrol in 2006, including for a mission on a mountain called Koran Ghar above the Chora Pass in Afghanistan’s Uruzgan province. The five-man patrol had carried 60kg packs to the top of the mountain during a 10-hour overnight climb to set up an observation post, watching over the valley, which was to be the scene of an allied assault. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On the second day of the observation mission, Person Two and another soldier spotted a young Afghan male – “about 14 or 15 years old”, Person Two told the court – walking on a goat-track, near to the observation post. He said the teenager was not armed with a weapon, nor carrying a radio or wearing webbing. Person Two said he did not believe the young man had seen the Australian soldiers and so did not open fire on him. Person Two told the court Roberts-Smith and another soldier, Sergeant Matt Locke, came down to the observation post from another position and berated the soldiers on lookout duty, saying “‘why the fuck didn’t you shoot him?”. “I said ‘because we’re in an observation post’.” Person Two explained to the court: “The task for the mission was to observe and surveil … not to become decisively engaged. That was to be avoided at all costs, because it then affects your ability to complete your larger mission.” The court heard Roberts-Smith and Locke ran off after the teenager. Person Two said “about a minute later, two minutes later, I heard four or five shots, a suppressed M4 and a suppressed SR 25”. Those were the two weapons carried by Roberts-Smith and Locke, Person Two told the court.

Roberts-Smith’s patrol became engaged in a fierce firefight for several hours, encircled on the mountaintop and under direct attack from Taliban fighters. They were ultimately able to get down the mountain, but only after calling in aerial support to attack the insurgent positions. Roberts-Smith and Locke, later killed in action, were both awarded the Medal for Gallantry for their actions on the mountaintop. Person Two told the court he did not believe the initial engagement of the lone young Afghan male was justified. “I don’t believe the engagement was legitimate, because our task for the mission was to observe and surveil. By engaging that male, it compromised the observation post, it compromised our mission.” In his evidence before the court last year, Roberts-Smith said the man was a legitimate military target who was moving suspiciously. When he shot the man, Roberts-Smith said a flare – “what you typically get when ordnance goes off or detonates” – came off chest webbing the man was wearing. Under cross-examination, Person Two was forced to defend his evidence. Bruce McClintock said the conversation where Roberts-Smith allegedly expressed a bloodlust “to kill” “never happened”. “You’ve entirely fabricated that Person Two,” McClintock said. “No, I did not,” Person Two said. McClintock also put it two Person Two that there were no photographs of dead insurgents, and that Roberts-Smith did not even own an iPod with a screen in 2006, when the alleged incident was said to have taken place. “Once again, you have entirely fabricated this, haven’t you?” “No, I haven’t.” Under cross-examination, Person Two said he had met with the journalist Chris Masters. Notes from Masters discussed in court revealed he disclosed information about his deployments and operations. Masters is one of the respondents in this trial. The trial, before Justice Anthony Besanko, continues.",News/Australia news,"Ben Roberts-Smith told another soldier in Afghanistan ‘I just want to kill’, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/ben-roberts-smith-told-another-soldier-in-afghanistan-i-just-want-to-kill-court-hears
2/24/2022,"Russian forces have unleashed an attack of Ukraine on the orders of Vladimir Putin, who announced a “special military operation” at dawn, amid warnings from world leaders that it could spark the biggest war in Europe since 1945. Within minutes of Putin’s short televised address, at about 5am Ukrainian time, explosions were heard near major Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv.  In a bid to justify the attack, Putin claimed “A hostile anti-Russia is being created on our historic lands.” “We have taken the decision to conduct a special military operation,” he said, claiming it was for the “demilitarisation and denazification” of Ukraine, echoing a theme of Kremlin propaganda, the false claim that the Kyiv government is controlled by the far right. “We do not intend to occupy Ukraine,” he said, and he had a chilling warning for other nations. “To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside: if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history. All relevant decisions have been taken. I hope you hear me,” he said. As Putin was speaking and the first detonations were being reported, the UN security council was holding an emergency session, chaired by Russia itself, which holds the rotating presidency. It was begun by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, who made a direct appeal: “President Putin – stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.” Joe Biden issued a written statement saying: “The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. “President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” Biden said. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.” The stage for the offensive was set on Thursday night, after the leaders of the two Russian-controlled territories in east Ukraine sent an official request to Moscow for military aid to “help repel the aggression of the Ukrainian armed forces in order to avoid civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe in the Donbas”. In response, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, used a video address to appeal to the Russian public for help after an attempt to speak to Putin was unsuccessful. “Do “Russians want wars? I would very much like to answer this question. But the answer is up to you,” he said. He also vowed to defend the country, saying: “If someone attempts to take away our land, our freedom, our lives, the lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. By attacking, you will see our faces, not our backs, but our faces.” The dramatic escalation marks the second time that Moscow has launched a significant military incursion into Ukraine since the country gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In 2014, Putin ordered undercover Russian soldiers to seize the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow then annexed. Thursday’s attack was preceded by a massive, continuous cyber-attack that targeted Ukraine’s ministries and banks, a form of hybrid warfare to sow confusion. In previous weeks, Putin built up an estimated 190,000 troops close to Ukraine’s borders while European leaders shuttled between Kyiv and Moscow, seeking a diplomatic solution. During the buildup Boris Johnson warned of a “bloody and protracted conflict” rooted in Putin’s anxiety about the encroachment of Nato since the end of the cold war as the old Soviet Union dissipated. “I think people need to understand the sheer cost in human life that that could entail – not just for Ukrainians, but also for Russians and for young Russians,” the prime minister said on 20 February. The Ukrainian leadership, initially sceptical of the alarm sounded by western leaders, this week declared a state of emergency, mobilised 36,000 reservists and passed a new law allowing Ukrainians to carry personal firearms. The state of emergency, starting on Thursday, allows authorities to impose curfews and restrictions on movement, block rallies and ban political parties and organisations “in the interests of national security and public order”. Ukraine also told nearly 3 million of its citizens to leave Russia. Ukrainians make up the largest diaspora community in Russia, where many have family members and travel to work. The events unfolded as EU countries approved tough new sanctions on Russian officials and “propagandists”, imposing asset freezes and travel bans on Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, and 351 Duma deputies who voted to recognise the Russian-controlled territories in east Ukraine. In Washington, Biden said he was allowing sanctions to move forward against the company that built the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, a day after Germany indefinitely suspended the project. As recently as Wednesday, Putin maintained he was “open for direct and honest dialogue, for the search for diplomatic solutions to the most complex problems”. In the video address delivered in connection with the Defender of the Fatherland Day, he also praised the battle-readiness of the military, adding: “The interests of Russia, the security of our citizens, are non-negotiable for us.” But his intentions were foreshadowed during a meeting with his security council on 21 February in Moscow, in which he recognised the so-called breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent. In a long and menacing speech he also asserted that Ukraine was not a state, but a historical mistake made by Lenin. Putin has also complained repeatedly of what he regards as western military encroachment in Ukraine. Last year he published an essay arguing Ukraine and Russia were “one people”, artificially divided by history. In 2014 the Ukrainian army collapsed under superior Russian firepower, sustaining serious losses in a battle for the strategic Donetsk region city of Debaltseve. However, Ukrainian commanders have said their soldiers were better equipped and more professional than eight years ago, and highly motivated. They predicted a bitter and bloody guerrilla war.",News/World news,Russia attacks Ukraine as Putin vows to ‘demilitarise’ neighbour,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/russia-attacks-ukraine-news-vladimir-putin-zelenskiy-russian-invasion
2/24/2022,"Clive Palmer has been taken to hospital by ambulance after reporting Covid-like symptoms earlier this week, with his office saying the billionaire is “just being tested”. Palmer, the chairman of the United Australia party, has been taken from his Gold Coast home to the Pindara private hospital.  The mining magnate on Tuesday cancelled a speech at the National Press Club in Canberra. The venue stated Palmer was experiencing “Covid-like symptoms”. Palmer’s spokesperson described them as “flu-like symptoms” at the time and said he was under medical orders not to travel to Canberra. A spokesperson for Palmer on Thursday said the businessman was “just being tested”. Palmer has previously told a New South Wales court he was not vaccinated against Covid. “I’m not vaccinated and I don’t intend to be vaccinated,” he also told an anti-lockdown rally in November 2021. The United Australia party’s headquarters, and party leader Craig Kelly, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The party plans to run candidates in every seat at the upcoming federal election, with Palmer and Kelly campaigning on a platform of removing Covid health measures and opposing vaccination mandates.",News/Australia news,Clive Palmer taken by ambulance to hospital days after exhibiting Covid-like symptoms,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/clive-palmer-taken-by-ambulance-to-hospital-days-after-exhibiting-covid-like-symptoms
2/24/2022,"Liberal MP Bridget Archer has blasted fellow Tasmanian senator Claire Chandler’s controversial legislation allowing sporting groups to exclude transgender people from single-sex sports as “a vanity bill” and “not government policy”. Archer’s excoriation follows a public endorsement of Chandler’s proposal by the prime minister. Scott Morrison this week backed the private senator’s bill which would amend the Sex Discrimination Act to “clarify” that the operation of single-sex sport on the basis of biological sex was not discriminatory.  During a visit to Tasmania the prime minister described Chandler’s proposal as “terrific”. “I support it, as Claire knows,” Morrison told reporters earlier this week. “I think it’s a terrific bill and I’ve given her great encouragement”. “Claire is a champion for women’s sport and I think she’s been right to raise these issues in the way that she has. Well done, Claire”. But Archer – who crossed the floor in an effort to secure protections for transgender children during the recent parliamentary debate about religious discrimination – characterised her colleague’s proposal as “unnecessary and divisive”. “This is not government policy – this is a vanity bill,” Archer said. She said the Coalition needed to desist from a culture war that had real world implications for vulnerable people. “I wish we would stop talking about these issues,” Archer said. “I think people need a break”. The Liberal senator, Andrew Bragg, said: “I don’t think importing US culture wars is a good idea.” “Despite US controversy, I am not aware of issues in Australia,” he told Guardian Australia. “The Sex Discrimination Act exemptions are already broad and appear to work as intended. I see no case for law reform.” Advocacy groups have expressed similar criticisms. The chief executive of Equality Australia, Anna Brown, said this week sporting groups had been working hard for decades to ensure inclusivity for trans and gender diverse people, saying “sport should be for everyone”. “In supporting this cruel, divisive and unnecessary bill, the prime minister once again underestimates the community’s support for trans and gender diverse children,” Brown said. “The Senate must act decisively and with the same conviction as their lower house colleagues by standing for the inclusion of trans kids by rejecting this bill in its entirety”. Archer’s pointed criticism follows the scuttling of the religious discrimination bill during the past parliamentary sitting fortnight. Five Liberal MPs, including Archer, crossed the floor to ensure the protection of gender non-conforming students under the Sex Discrimination Act. The rebellion by moderates forced Morrison to shelve the government’s proposal after the amendments aimed at protecting LGBTQ+ students sparked a backlash from religious schools and government conservatives. Bragg had said he was prepared to support these amendments in the Senate. During his pre-campaign visit to Tasmania this week, before he endorsed Chandler’s bill, Morrison made a point of praising Archer, an outspoken Liberal moderate. Asked by a reporter whether he continued to support Archer “even though she has been speaking out against some things lately” Morrison replied: “Bridget, I know, is passionate”. “Bridget has come with life experience to our team that I greatly value and I greatly respect,” the prime minister said. “You know, we love Bridge. We really do. And I’m really pleased she’s on my team, and she’s on my team and she’s a fiery member of my team and she’s a fiery member for Bass”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When she introduced her private member’s bill back on 10 February, Chandler told parliament single-sex sport for women and girls was “a fundamental good for our society”. She said the need to separate females and males on the sporting field – in the vast majority of sports – had “been understood for decades”. “Millions of Australian parents and grandparents have proudly watched their daughters’ and granddaughters’ sporting achievements: playing their first game, winning their first trophy, making their first state team, or signing their first professional contract,” Chandler said. “Yet under recent interpretations of Australia’s Sex Discrimination Act 1984 sporting codes, clubs and volunteers can have legal action taken against them for offering single-sex women’s sport”. “This interpretation has been used as a weapon to pressure sporting organisations to allow males to play women’s sport”. Only one week of parliament remains before the federal election, and that week will be dominated by the budget on 29 March. It is unclear whether the government will seek to bring Chandler’s bill to a vote.",News/Australia news,‘A vanity bill’: Bridget Archer condemns fellow government MP’s single-sex sports proposal,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/a-vanity-bill-bridget-archer-condemns-fellow-government-mps-single-sex-sports-proposal
