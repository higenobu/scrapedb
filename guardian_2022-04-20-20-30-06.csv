4/20/2022,"Liza Minnelli was “forced” to appear in a wheelchair against her will at last month’s Oscars, a longtime collaborator has claimed. Michael Feinstein, a singer and pianist and friend of Minnelli has said that her appearance at the end of the ceremony, in which she presented the best picture award alongside Lady Gaga, left her “very disappointed”. “She only agreed to appear at the Oscars if she would be in a director’s chair, because she’s been having back trouble,” said Feinstein on Tuesday, speaking on SiriusXM’s The Jess Cagle Show. “She said, ‘I don’t want people to see me limping out there.’ She said, ‘You know, I want to look good. I don’t want people to worry about me.’” Minnelli and Gaga’s presentation of the best picture prize to Coda provided a relatively calm close to a show overshadowed by events an hour or so earlier, when Will Smith slapped presenter Chris Rock on stage. This disruption had “shaken up” the organisers, claimed Feinstein, leading them to abruptly change the plan for Minnelli. According to Feinstein, a stage manager informed her just minutes before her appearance that she’d be seated in a wheelchair rather than a director’s chair. It is not known whether Minnelli was originally supposed to be wheeled on to stage and then transferred to the chair during an ad break or whether she was intended to walk with aid to the chair. “She was nervous,” said Feinstein, “and it made her look like she was out of it. Can you imagine being suddenly forced to be seen by millions of people the way you don’t want to be seen? That’s what happened to her.” Earlier this year, Feinstein and Minnelli duetted on Embraceable You for Feinstein’s latest album, Gershwin Country. Gaga and Minnelli won praise from audiences and critics for their warm and collaborative turn. The pair have been close for more than a decade, and last month Minnelli’s former publicist Scott Gorenstein told People their appearance at the Oscars was at the direct request of Gaga.",Arts/Film,Liza Minnelli was ‘sabotaged’ at Oscars and ‘forced’ to appear in wheelchair,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/20/liza-minnelli-was-sabotaged-at-oscars-and-forced-to-appear-in-wheelchair
4/20/2022,"Here is a very illegal, totally ineffective get-rich-quick scheme: 1. Borrow a billion dollars for a day.2. Buy 51% of the shares of a small bank.3. Hold a vote amongst the bank’s shareholders to send all the money in the bank’s vaults to you, which you win, because you own 51% of the shares of the bank.4. Sell your shares in the bank.5. Pay back your billion dollar loan. The scheme is illegal because, well, almost all the individual steps are themselves illegal. A board vote cannot simply transfer corporate assets to a majority shareholder, that would be embezzlement, a crime; a bank cannot transfer assets in its vault as it sees fit, because then it wouldn’t meet reserve requirements, a crime. And it’s ineffective to boot: you would find it tricky to borrow a billion dollars, buy up all your shares in the bank, and hold a vote amongst the bank’s shareholders to take the bank’s reserves before the bank’s customers discovered your scheme and raced to be the first to withdraw their assets. Here is a maybe legal, definitely effective get-rich-quick scheme: 1. Do the same thing, but in crypto. From our story: The Beanstalk cryptocurrency has been stripped of reserves valued at more than $180m (£138m) in seconds, after an attacker used borrowed money to snap up enough voting rights to transfer the money away. A still-unidentified attacker had borrowed $80m in cryptocurrency and deposited it in the project’s silo, gaining enough voting rights in exchange to be able to pass any proposal instantly. With that power, they voted to transfer the contents of the treasury to themselves, then returned the voting rights, withdrew their money, and repaid the loan – all in a matter of seconds. Beanstalk was – is, technically, though the writing is on the wall – a stablecoin project, which aimed to create a cryptocurrency, Beans, that would permanently be worth $1. But the name is confusing: the best way to think of stablecoins is as the crypto world’s equivalent of banks. You hand a project assets, and they give you a promise that they will be preserved until you ask for them back. A bank tracks your deposits with it by giving you an account number, and a balance; a stablecoin does the same by giving you, well, stablecoins. Most stablecoins tout their large reserves as a reason to trust them; the biggest, such as Tether and USDC, once very simply promised that every coin they issued was backed one to one by a dollar in their reserves (those claims have been watered down in recent years, and one of the ongoing disputes in the crypto space is whether they were ever true in the first place). Smaller stablecoins, like Beanstalk, tend to combine the banking aspect with what’s sometimes called a “honest Ponzi”: a promise to pay wild rates of interest, clearly and openly funded from new inflows of capital. All of which is to say that Beanstalk held hundreds of millions of dollars worth of digital assets as reserves to back a stablecoin that was supposed to permanently be worth $1. Until it didn’t. Flash! A-ah! Over the weekend, an attacker took advantage of a “flash loan” to seize control of Beanstalk for seconds. Flash loans are something only possible in the crypto space: a loan which is paid back the same instant it’s made. What’s the advantage? Well, say you’ve spotted a way to buy a digital asset for $5 and sell it for $6 – then you can, in one seamless transaction, borrow $5m, execute the trade to make $6m, return $5m and profit for $1m. The lender takes no risk – because the loan literally cannot be made without being repaid – and collects a small fee for the practice. In Beanstalk’s case, the trade wasn’t such a clean arbitrage. It was, effectively, the get-rich-quick scheme I described. The attacker used the loan to buy up voting rights in the “decentralised autonomous organisation” (you’ll remember those from January) that controls Beanstalk. It then passed an emergency resolution to take all the money Beanstalk held, with enough votes – more than two thirds – that it took effect immediately. It sold the rights, returned the loan, and began the process of laundering the proceeds. To be fair to Beanstalk, the attack wasn’t quite as open – and stupid – as the get-rich-quick scheme sounds. There was subterfuge involved: proposals needed to be submitted 24 hours beforehand, so the actual proposal wasn’t as simple as “give me all your money”; on the surface, it looks more like a proposal to donate $250,000 to Ukraine, with a single line serving to trigger a flurry of extra contracts that drained the coffers. But nonetheless, but the rules of the crypto world, it’s not entirely clear what wrongdoing was committed. The attacker acquired voting rights in a way explicitly allowed by the code of the project, voted for a proposal explicitly allowed by the code of the project, and took money in a way explicitly allowed by the code of the project. Any of these things could have been tweaked: you could try and write a stablecoin, as many have, that prevents even the DAO that backs it from interfering with reserves; you could prevent flash loans from being used to acquire voting rights; you could prevent resolutions from being voted on until after they’ve been explicitly security checked and approved. Beanstalk … didn’t. By the rules of the real world, there is almost certainly a crime here, although it’s not easy to identify which one. Maybe fraud? Probably you cannot hand someone computer code that says in quite clear English that it is a proposal to donate $250,000 to Ukraine but which actually donates $180m to you, and then when they run it, say “haha suckers” and not get in some sort of legal trouble. But the deeper you get into the crypto sector, the less the rules of the real world apply. In the real world, you also cannot start a wildcat bank that mints its own currency to pay double digit interest rates out of customer funds. In the last day, the founders of Beanstalk have laid out a four point plan to recover from the heist, detailing their goals of raising more reserves, making whole those who were invested in the project before the attack, and “securing the enduring success of Beanstalk’s economic model”. Best of luck to them, but I think their initial response, on the day of the attack, might be more true: “Honestly not sure what to type. We are fucked … It is highly unlikely there is any sort of bailout coming.” If you want to read the complete version of the newsletter please subscribe to receive TechScape in your inbox every Wednesday.",News/Technology,TechScape: How a cryptocurrency project lost $180m to a get-rich-quick scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/20/techscape-beanstalk-cryptocurrency
4/20/2022,"Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen will go head to head in a live TV debate on Wednesday night that could prove crucial in making up the minds of undecided voters four days before the French presidential runoff. The high-stakes, two-and-a-half-hour confrontation, the only direct clash between the two candidates, has been a tradition of French presidential campaigns since 1974, often confirming or dashing electoral ambitions. With recent polls giving Macron a lead of up to 12 points before Sunday’s vote, Le Pen will be keen not to reproduce the poorly prepared, muddled and aggressive performance that sealed her eventual defeat in 2017. “The debate was a failure for which I paid a very heavy price,” Le Pen admitted last month, vowing not to make the same mistakes twice. One of her closest advisers, Philippe Olivier, said she had been “preparing for this moment for five years”. The race is far tighter this year and for Macron, who won by a margin of 66% to 34% five years ago, the greatest danger may be of appearing arrogant – a trait for which he is often criticised – as he attacks what he has termed Le Pen’s “fantasy” policies. “He can’t come across as too technical, too professorial,” said one Macron aide. “Her whole thing is about being on the side of the people; he can’t be dismissive. But he has explain the problems, the inconsistencies, the impossibilities of her programme. It’s a difficult balancing act.” The president also starts at a disadvantage since this time around he has a track record that his challenger will be able to attack. “He’s in a much trickier position – he has something to defend,” said Jean Garrigues, a historian and political scientist. But Macron faces a rival who has lost momentum as her France-first manifesto – which includes enshrining a “national preference” for jobs, housing and welfare and declaring the primacy of French legislation over international law, bringing France into immediate conflict with the EU – comes under closer scrutiny. Macron can also point to an unemployment rate at a 13-year low and an economy that has outperformed those of other major European countries, and he is likely to confront Le Pen over her past admiration for Vladimir Putin and her plan to ban wearing the hijab in public. For her part, Le Pen will try to present herself as a credible leader and defender of the workers, and portray Macron as belonging to an out-of-touch elite, with possible attack lines including Macron’s controversial plan to raise the retirement age. “Fear is the only argument the current president has to try to stay in power at all costs,” the National Rally leader said in a campaign clip this week, accusing Macron of doom-mongering over a far-right presidency. The debate, due to start at 9pm local time, will be broadcast live on the two main French public and private TV channels as well as the 24-hour news stations. It is likely to attract an audience of millions – the 2017 clash was watched by 16.4 million – and has been tightly choreographed, with every detail agreed by both camps. The teams have each appointed “consultant producers” who will be in the studio and can intervene if they feel their candidate is being disadvantaged. A mutually acceptable backdrop has been designed, and 2.5 metres set as the distance between the opponents. The studio temperature will be set at 19C. A draw has determined that Le Pen will speak first, and Macron will have the last word. The debate will address eight themes: cost of living; social policy including pensions and healthcare; environment; the economy; education; law and order; immigration; and institutional reform.",News/World news,Macron and Le Pen to face off in crucial live TV election debate,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/macron-and-le-pen-face-off-in-crucial-live-tv-election-debate
4/20/2022,"On the first night of Passover, more than 100 Ukrainian refugees gathered for a seder at the Doubletree-Hilton in Warsaw, Poland. The Haggadah, the accompanying liturgical libretto, directs its readers to see themselves as if they had personally exited from slavery. This year, Russia made that task easier. “We have pharaohs in neighboring countries,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, speaking to the world from Ukraine. Those here in Warsaw left behind family and friends in places like Kyiv and Sumy. Some hope to return but are uncertain if they would any time soon. Israel and Germany loom as likely next stops. “Next year in Jerusalem,” the 2,000-year-old credo, remained the evening’s final words. The past is really never past; history haunts. My father grew up in Pacanów, a small shtetl in south-central Poland. As the second world war descended, his family fled. They weathered the war years in Uzbekistan. Against this backdrop, Passover 2022 marked an unanticipated homecoming – of sorts. Back at the hotel, reasons for personal optimism reared their collective head. A couple spoke excitedly of their newborn son and his upcoming bris. A mohel was set to arrive from Austria. Families also schlepped their pets. One dog – Foxy – appeared at the seder. The internet enabled those employed by multinationals to continue working. The seder looked typical. Were it not for those attending, it would have been unremarkable. The rabbi who led the service stressed that doing one’s best to sustain normalcy was paramount. So too were crafting an instant community and letting people know they were not alone – just as in the first Passover recorded in the Book of Exodus. In the Bible’s telling, the holiday is a celebration of liberation, religious freedom and family. Later, pilgrimage to Jerusalem and a stream of sacrifices marked the occasion. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the seder and Haggadah gradually emerged, partly as an effort to recapture lost memories, but also as an expression of gratitude, grievance and anxiety – in different measures at different times. The text repeatedly offers thanks to the deity, and says dayeinu, “that would have been enough”. The sentiment, “if You had only brought us out of Egypt and done nothing more, that would have been fine”, closely tracks the literal message on the page. Practically speaking, however, few would wish to be stranded in a desert. Like a river, the Haggadah accretes content. It is not a static narrative. The Crusades ravaged the Rhineland’s Jewish communities. In the early 13th century, the Haggadah came to implore God to vent his wrath, the unmistaken request of the powerless. During the second world war, Poland and Ukraine doubled as battlegrounds and killing fields. More than three million Jews were slaughtered in Poland. In Ukraine, the estimate exceeds one million. At times, local collaborators lent their hands to the carnage. As for Poland and Ukraine, both are Slavic countries whose relations date back to at least the 14th century. Oscillating between allies and enemies, they fought each other between 1918 and 1919 in what became known as the Polish-Ukrainian war. Religious and linguistic differences are potential sore spots, too. Parts of Ukraine, formerly ruled by Poland after the Union of Brest in 1596, became Catholic, tied to Rome rather than to Orthodoxy. Later, in the Austro-Hungarian part of Ukraine, Polish emerged as the language of secondary school instruction, and was viewed as the more “civilized” tongue. Ghosts still hover, but not all apparitions are scary. Necessity can supplant memory and shape what follows. One place to start with is “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”. The facade of the Polin Museum of the History of Polish Jews is a prime example. Large Polish and Ukrainian flags now drape the museum’s exterior. The building sits on the site of the former Warsaw Ghetto, on a street named for Mordechai Anielewicz, the 24-year-old leader of the ghetto’s uprising against the Nazis. Message and meaning are inescapable. Likewise, the quotidian possesses its own elegance. On Good Friday, an overflow crowd spilled out of a church just a mile up the road from the hotel. The priest’s homily and the choir’s song echoed from a loudspeaker. Posters expressed support for Ukraine. A memorial to Pope John Paul II reminds worshippers of past clashes with communism and the Soviet regime. A food truck decked in blue and yellow stood in the church’s parking lot. Religion and patriotism matter, as do small gestures. The west is not as decadent nor as cowering as Vladimir Putin and his allies believe. There is fight left. Historic enmities and rivalries can be set aside in the face of a common threat. A wolf at the door is a great motivator. The Haggadah reminds the reader that adversity can forge renewed resolve. For the people of Ukraine and its refugees, let us hope it does. Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York.

4/20/2022,"Consumers will soon be able to check where their energy is coming from hourly, and get a discount on bills if they use electricity when renewables are in surplus. Under plans by the startup Granular and energy giants including Elexon and National Grid, energy companies will allow UK consumers to track their power source. This could help the country reduce emissions, as it will be easier for people to choose energy companies that are transparent about exactly how much renewable energy they use. Because there are times of day when renewable energy is less available – for example when it is less windy or sunny – consumers could be incentivised to use power when it is in oversupply by offering a discount on their bills. This could lead to less gas being used. The current system is based on annual matching, in which the energy provider looks at the previous year’s energy use and matches it with the equivalent amount of renewable energy, but there is a growing trend to move to hourly matching instead. Companies including Google and Microsoft have been calling for the move as it could lead to organisations being able to definitively say they use renewable energy 24/7. It will also increase consumer demand, say experts, as they will be able to choose more renewable options. This is likely to lead to companies investing in renewables, and in battery technology for more efficient storage. Toby Ferenczi, a co-founder of Granular, said consumers could be seeing this change by the end of the year. He said: “Long term, what this is enabling an acceleration towards a completely carbon-free grid as it is harnessing consumer spending power to source energy from carbon-free sources each hour. “This drives investment in not just renewables but in energy storage and flexibility. Eventually customers will be able to buy green energy from their energy supplier by the hour.” He said the method could allow people to get discounts on their bills. “It’s an incentive for load shifting and demand response so we want to provide a revenue stream for people who do that – renewable energy should be cheap when it’s in oversupply and more expensive when undersupplied, so it would give an incentive for consumers to shift their demand towards when it’s oversupplied.”",News/Environment,UK consumers able to track renewable energy hourly under new plans,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/20/uk-consumers-able-to-track-renewable-energy-hourly-under-new-plans
