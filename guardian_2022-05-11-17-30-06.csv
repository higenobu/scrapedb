5/11/2022,"The British camping brand Cool Camping has been taken over by a large US company, Hipcamp, which aims to bring its Airbnb-style model of campsite booking to the UK. From today, all 25,000 camping pitches and glamping structures on Cool Camping’s website will be listed instead on Hipcamp. Based in San Francisco, Hipcamp claims to be the world’s biggest provider of outdoor stays, offering half a million campsites in the US, Canada and Australia. This is its first foray into Europe. As well as covering commercial campsites and glamping, the site enables private landowners to rent their outdoor space to campers, in the same way Airbnb enables homeowners to rent properties and spare rooms to holidaymakers. Anyone with suitable land can charge from £10 a night for a pitch using the Hipcamp platform, setting their own nightly rates. Listings on the website are free, but Hipcamp takes 15% from each booking. Only those in rural locations, rather than urban and suburban settings, and with an acre or more of available space can sign up. They must provide toilets for tent campers (though not for campervanners), can choose to offer outdoor activities and extras, such as fresh eggs or fry-ups for breakfast, and must meet a list of other criteria regarding safety, hygiene and planning laws. Many will operate under the UK’s 28-day planning exemption, which allows landowners to use their land for commercial activities for up to 28 days a year. Private hosts will be eligible for Hipcamp’s liability insurance, which protects them for up to £1m. Hipcamp’s founder and CEO Alyssa Ravasio, who launched the business in the US in 2013, said her aim was to make it simpler for more people to get outside. “I realised that given how crowded our public campgrounds are, the only way to achieve that mission was to create new places, which we started doing on private land,” she said. “We leverage data to understand what specific destinations are likely to book out months ahead, then reach out to landowners in that area.” Since launching, Hipcamp has “unlocked” some 1,618,000 hectares of private land, ranging from a blueberry farm in Canada to glamping on an Australian ranch. It has booked more than six million guest nights, seeing a 460% increase in bookings since 2019 and acquiring Australia’s Youcamp camping platform in 2020. Its funding drives have raised tens of millions of dollars, including investment from the musician Jay Z’s venture capital firm Marcy Venture Partners. Meanwhile, Cool Camping’s bookings increased 340% during the same period, thanks in part to the covid-related boom in staycationing. Jonathan Knight, the founder and former managing director of Cool Camping, said that he hadn’t been looking to sell when approached by Hipcamp, but was “struck by the similarities between the two brands. Not only the types of places we feature – small, independent campsites and glamping sites with something a bit special about them – but also our philosophies. It feels natural to combine everything.” Knight said that allowing British private landowners, farmers, vintners and others to create new revenue streams through camping would help to conserve land and keep it wild, while bringing an economic boost to rural communities. He turned Cool Camping from a publisher of guidebooks to a booking platform in 2015, phasing out the guidebooks a few years ago. He will remain as Hipcamp’s UK manager. Hipcamp isn’t the first to offer camping on private land in the UK. Wildpoint.com, which launched in 2021, facilitates camping in people’s gardens and outdoor space, as does Campspace.com and HomeCamper.com, while Wild With Consent lists spots for campervanners and motorhomers. As well as appealing to private hosts, Hipcamp will continue to add commercial campsites to its UK portfolio, and launch an app for Brits to browse and book stays. There are no plans to expand into other countries at present. “As far as we know, camping as a recreational pastime originated in the UK. As a result, the camping market here is the most developed in the world,” said Ravasio. “This country is leading the way globally in its thinking about agritourism – specifically, that camping and glamping can support not only the preservation of local culture and economies, but also the rewilding of critical habitat. “For a long time,” she said, “demand for unique, private and affordable outdoor stays has outpaced supply in the UK. So we see a real opportunity for Hipcamp to help solve that problem.”",Lifestyle/Travel,Airbnb-style camping comes to UK as US giant Hipcamp buys Cool Camping,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/may/11/us-giant-hipcamp-buys-cool-camping-airbnb-style-glamping
5/11/2022,"It would have been a dauntless pundit who gambled on where Sophie Ward would go with her second novel. Her 2020 debut, the Booker-longlisted Love and Other Thought Experiments, took the form of a series of loosely interconnected stories, each one a riff on a well-known philosophical thought experiment such as Pascal’s wager, a bet on the existence of God, or Heraclitus’s river, the idea that change is the only constant. Inventive and ideas-heavy, the novel defied genre, taking in everything from modern relationships to space exploration and AI. One chapter was narrated by a child in the process of being born, another from the point of view of an ant living inside a human character’s brain. While the book divided critics, it established Ward as a literary provocateur, a writer pushing at the bounds of what fiction could do. Yet her follow-up, The Schoolhouse, is a much more conventional undertaking. The novel takes place over a long December weekend in 1990, and divides its increasingly interwoven narrative between two female protagonists in north London. Isobel is a librarian whose life is carefully and consciously proscribed. Deaf as a result of a childhood accident, she does everything she can to avoid “the intrusion of the outside world”, sticking to strict routines and retreating each evening to the safety of her small upstairs flat, where she keeps the curtains and doors tightly closed. Sally Carter, meanwhile, is a detective sergeant, battling the stultifying hierarchy and institutional sexism of the Metropolitan police. On Friday morning, as the story begins, Carter is assigned to a missing persons case. Ten-year-old Caitlin Thompson has failed to come home after school and her parents are frantic. Meanwhile Isobel, whose schooling concluded abruptly 15 years ago, returns from the library to find a letter from one of her teachers, informing her that her old classmate Jason has been released from prison and is asking if they can meet. Sally Carter’s narrative sticks closely to the genre principles of the police procedural, not only in form but in flavour. While Ward’s prose is consistently crisp, the guarded Carter feels all too familiar, the distillation of a hundred cops from books and television shows: scarred by an old failed case, she is a maverick who goes above and beyond, even when it means breaking the rules. There are allusions, never fleshed out, to a difficult childhood – Carter “hadn’t really had a mother for a long time. Possibly ever, she thought, if you considered the act of mothering to be a prerequisite for the title”. Although Ward avoids the loner archetype by giving Carter a girlfriend, a junior member of her team, the relationship gets little page time. The woman behind the surname remains frustratingly opaque. It is into Isobel – and, in particular, Isobel as a child – that Ward pours her considerable insight and humanity. As her carefully suppressed past threatens to engulf her, Isobel’s adult story is punctuated with entries from her diary from 1975, unspooling the catastrophic series of events that led to her accident with a horrible inevitability. On the brink of adolescence, the young Isobel attends a so-called progressive school, the eponymous Schoolhouse, where the pupils are an all-age-group ragtag of misfits and outcasts, and structured lessons are cast aside in favour of self-expression. Ward has spoken in interviews about her years at an experimental primary school and she paints an unsettlingly vivid portrait of the squalid, chaotic Schoolhouse, its extravagant plans for on-site petting zoos and a giant slide from the top of the building to an outside swimming pool realised only so far as a single classroom and a mangy horse stabled in the playground. Insufficiently supervised, chronically understimulated, routinely shamed by their sadistic headteacher, the children run wild, their apparently carefree existence undercut by violence and fear. For observant, obstinate Isobel, a longtime pupil, it is ordinary life. As events spiral out of her control her journal is an authentic mixture of callousness and conscience, swaggering bravado and sick dread. As Isobel and Carter’s narratives mesh and the weekend gives way to Monday, The Schoolhouse accelerates towards an improbably overcooked conclusion. It is a pity because, behind the Line of Duty-esque noise and fury, this novel has much to say about childhood and, in particular, the failures by adults in authority to protect the children in their care. As she explores two very different crises in two very different decades, Ward unpicks the damage caused not just by people intent on harm, but those around them who, blinded by idealism, prejudice or laziness, cannot see what is right before their eyes. Her anger is palpable, but so too is her compassion. A child betrayed by the adults in her life may survive, is her fierce message, but the damage lasts a lifetime.

5/11/2022,"The recent spurt in inflation has little do with with workers being paid more, economists say, warning the claim that wages increases could set-off inflation is ‘over-the-top alarmism’. Debate over how much the lowest-paid workers should receive has flared during the election campaign after the ACTU this week raised its minimum wage claim to the Fair Work Commission to 5.5% from an earlier goal of 5%, after March-quarter consumer prices spiked. Labor leader Anthony Albanese on Tuesday said he “absolutely” supported wages keeping up with inflation, prompting the government to accuse him of making up policy on the run. Jim Stanford, an economist and director of the Centre for Future Work, said worries that a wage-price escalation would kick off if wage increases reached 5% a year were overblown. Such increases had been “normal” in the first decade of this century, with three years of such rises, and the economy could cope with their return. “This over-the-top alarmism shows how much the goalposts have shifted after nine straight years of historically weak wages growth,” Stanford said. “In most countries it would be seen as desirable that wages would finally show some vitality.” OECD data also showed the minimum wage – set by the commission at $20.33 an hour for the current fiscal year – has been falling as a proportion of median Australian wages since 1999. Australia’s ratio is now near the OECD average, and lower than countries such as the UK, which has lifted the ratio from 41% to 58% over that time. And, from a recent ACTU, how Australia's minimum wages have been tracking compared with median wages, and relative to other OECD members. #auspol #AusVotes2022 #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/HSQ1t9lWTR The seven-member Fair Work Commission panel will announce its minimum wage verdict by late May or early June. Typically, they take into account the five minimum wage objectives and consider both the headline CPI and underlying inflation rate, which were 5.1% and 3.7%, respectively, in the March quarter. The current year’s increase of 2.5% from 2020-21 was higher than the 1.1% annual headline and trimmed mean inflation rate recorded in the March quarter of 2021, the most recent data before the commission a year ago. Business bodies such as the AiGroup and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have made separate submissions to the Fair Work Commission, saying the minimum wage increase should be no more than 2.5% and 3%, respectively. They argue workers will receive an extra 0.5 percentage point in superannuation contributions from 1 July and many will also share the benefits of the government’s extended low-middle-income-tax-offset (LMITO). “Adding these increases to our [2.5%] proposal would result in the equivalent of a 4.3% increase in pre-tax remuneration for low-paid employees,” AiGroup’s chief executive Innes Willox said. “In the current circumstances, there is a clear risk that a high increase in wages without improved workplace productivity would fuel inflation and increase the likelihood of a steeper rise in interest rates to the detriment of growth and job creation.” ACCI chief executive Andrew McKellar said an increase of 5% or more “would inflict further damage on small business, and the millions of jobs they sustain and create” as companies struggle to recover from the Covid pandemic disruptions. “While cost-of-living issues have taken centre stage in the federal election campaign, what we’re not hearing enough of is the rising costs businesses are facing,” he said. However Stanford, a co-author of a wage crisis report released by the Australia Institute on Wednesday, said the super increase wouldn’t help workers repay bills. Similarly, firms relying on a tax offset to bolster staff wages were unlikely to compensate workers once the offset runs out next financial year. “Do we actually think it is the government’s responsibility to subsidise the failure of business to pay a living wage by handing out tax year after year?” he said. “They want workers to experience a continuing real wage cut because they think that’s the way to solve this inflation issue even though this inflation has nothing to do with wages,” Stanford said. “No one has argued that this inflation has been caused by domestic wages.” Timely wages report out today from @TheAusInstitute on wages. Seems like a few key trends stand out when it comes labour costs, including real costs: https://t.co/5bnv8SHD38 pic.twitter.com/G5LTzDmO0l Alan Oster, NAB’s chief economist, said there was no wage-price spiral underway, but said the RBA would lift rates faster if it thought inflation expectations were settling in. “The reality is [real wages are] going backwards,” Oster said. “But then again, you don’t want to spark expectations that if you can get a 5% increase in the national wage case, then everybody else should shoot for 5%. That I think would be more of an issue.” Oster expects the wage price index for the March quarter to show a rise of 0.6-0.7%, implying a year-on-year increase of 2.5%, when the ABS releases the figures on 18 May. That outcome implies a drop in real wages of 1.2% when compared with the underlying inflation rate, or double that if the headline CPI is the contrast. Oster says Australia had three labour markets. The national wage case will probably see an increase of 3% or more. Then there’s the state governments and their public sectors facing salary caps of 2.5% but soon to rise, if they haven’t already. Then there’s rest of the economy where workers in manufacturing, construction and some other sectors could command rising salaries. Staff in hospitality and – somewhat surprisingly – mining were yet to see much in the way of higher wages. “That’s got really low numbers,” he said. “So it’s almost like they’re saying, ‘I’ll give you more shifts. I won’t pay you an hourly rate that’s any bigger’.”",News/Australia news,‘Over-the-top alarmism’: economists dismiss concerns wage rises cause inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/over-the-top-alarmism-economists-dismiss-concerns-wage-rises-cause-inflation

5/11/2022,"Seven News political editor Mark Riley says he’ll use “a chair and a whip” to control Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese in the third and final leaders’ debate and avoid a repeat of Sunday night’s “spectacle”. “The two leaders will be behind podiums with me in the middle with a chair and a whip,” Riley told Guardian Australia ahead of Seven’s The Great Debate: The Final Showdown. It will air on Wednesday at 9.10pm after Big Brother finishes. Seven’s debate format will be different to the first and second debates. Sky News had members of the audience ask the leaders questions on 20 April and Nine News on Sunday had a facilitator in Sarah Abo and a panel of three journalists asking questions. Nine’s debate rated well but was roundly criticised for the lack of moderation which led to the two men shouting and talking over each other – leaving viewers unable to hear what they were saying. Seven’s debate will have a single moderator asking the questions in a more traditional format, Riley said. “At the last election the ABC’s Sabra Lane hosted the National Press Club debate – and this is a little heretical for me because I was involved in one of them – it was the best debate of the three,” the veteran reporter, who has won Walkleys for commentary and foreign reporting, said on Wednesday. The debate will be broadcast live on Channel 7, 7plus and the West Australian, and will feature a so-called Pub Test to determine the winner, using a panel of 150 undecided voters who will judge the debate and cast their votes live from pubs in seven marginal seats around the country. The seats are Macquarie in NSW, Chisholm in Victoria, Lilley in Queensland, Boothby in South Australia, Hasluck in Western Australia, Solomon in the Northern Territory and Bass in Tasmania. Riley hopes to produce something that is “worthwhile to viewers who’ve been making up their mind which way to go”. “They’re here to debate not berate,” Riley said on Seven’s Sunrise. “Voters want to hear about their policies, not their put-downs. This is about the highest office in the land. It’s not a game of marbles. I think they’ll get that after the weekend. I mean, the spectacle of Sunday night didn’t shine well on either of them. I think they understand that. But you know, if they do it again, I’ll get the whip and the chair out and stop it.” Riley said the leaders will deliver opening statements and then be asked a number of questions. “They’ll be given time to do that,” he said. “I won’t be cutting them off mid-sentence. They’ll finish their thoughts. And then after they’ve answered those questions, there’ll be a time for engagement and real debate after that in a civil way, we hope, so voters can get an idea about the differences in their policy positions, the differences in their characters, the differences in their vision for the country. That’s what’s important.” The West Australian’s federal political editor Lanai Scarr will also get the chance to ask a few questions and analyse the debate in a special edition of Seven News with Michael Usher. It will cross live to the marginal seats for the Pub Test.",News/Australia news,Mark Riley wants Seven’s election debate to be better than Nine’s Sunday night ‘spectacle’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/mark-riley-wants-sevens-election-debate-to-be-better-than-nines-sunday-night-spectacle
