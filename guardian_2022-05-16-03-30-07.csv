5/16/2022,"The Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey will face a grilling from angry Conservative MPs over inflation on Monday, as cabinet sources moved to quell the incendiary remarks about the Bank’s independence. The governor’s appearance before MPs – which has been likened to the showdowns with former Bank boss Lord Mervyn King during the 2008 crash – will come amid intense work from the chancellor Rishi Sunak to find new measures to ease the cost of living before the summer recess. Labour will challenge Conservative MPs to vote for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in an amendment to the Queen’s speech – a move the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has failed to rule out but which is intensely opposed by the business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. Bailey’s appearance at the Treasury select committee will come in the aftermath of growing criticism of the Bank’s performance, including from some cabinet ministers, one of whom told the Telegraph they were now “questioning its independence”. Cabinet sources moved to quell speculation, with one dismissing the prospect as “not even up for discussion”. Another cabinet minister called independence “sacrosanct” and said the Bank’s situation was not unique. “All central banks are grappling inflation.” A Downing Street source said that Boris Johnson was not entertaining the prospect. Harriett Baldwin, one of the Tory MPs on the committee, said there were serious questions for the Bank to answer on inflation. “I have been flagging up for a long time now the risk of them misjudging things and putting in too much monetary stimulus into the economy for too long,” she said. “When things started to open up again, they didn’t really take their foot off the pedal very quickly. There are things that have been unforeseen like the war in Ukraine, but there are things that were foreseen that the fiscal and monetary stimulus was there for too long and too protracted once things started to recover.” Kwarteng said on Sunday that it was concerning that inflation was running higher than the Bank’s target. “It is a matter of fact that when the Bank of England became independent in 1997, they had an inflation target of 2%. Inflation is running into almost double digits now. That is an issue, clearly,” he told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. “We have had the Covid pandemic, we have had a huge spike in economic activity after the lockdown restrictions were eased, and then, of course, you have got this war in Europe for the first time in 70 years. “All of these things mean that it is a very difficult time and I think he is doing a reasonable job. But it is true to say that 2% is part of their mandate and they have to keep it to 2%.” Labour said the attacks on the bank’s independence were a distraction. Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow chancellor, said: “Instead of trying to blame the Bank of England for the government’s mistakes, the Chancellor should call an Emergency budget, scrap the hike in national insurance and back Labour’s costed plan for a windfall tax to help keep people’s energy bills down.” The Treasury has denied plans for an emergency budget but is expected to announce some new limited measures to ease the cost of living once data on fuel prices appears within the next fortnight which will inform the autumn price cap rise. Tax changes will be impossible before the autumn budget, though Johnson has repeatedly insisted to MPs that he is looking for ways to cut taxes. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband said it was “frankly obscene that the government is refusing” a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and predicted it was inevitable, calling it “unanswerable case”.",News/Business,Tory MPs to grill Bank of England governor over high inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/15/tory-mps-to-grill-bank-of-england-governor-over-high-inflation
5/16/2022,"Frontlines have shifted as Russia makes advances in the fiercely contested eastern Donbas region and Ukraine’s forces waged a successful counter-offensive near the strategic Russian-held city of Izium. Near the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, where Ukrainian forces have been on the attack since early this month, local commanders said they believed Russia was withdrawing troops to reinforce positions around Izium to the south. Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have carried out “high-precision” missile strikes on four artillery munitions depots in the Donetsk area, also destroying two missile-launching systems and radar and taking out 15 Ukrainian drones. But British military intelligence said in an update that Russia’s offensive in the Donbas had “lost momentum” and that it believed Moscow had now lost one-third of its invading force. Heavy fighting is still raging at the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, as Russian forces attempt to complete the capture of the strategically vital port. A pro-Russian separatist commander posted a video on Sunday showing white brightly burning munitions falling on the steel plant. It was not immediately apparent what type of munitions were used or the time of the video, which was posted on the Telegram messaging application by Alexander Khodakovsky, a commander of the pro-Russian self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk. Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are holed up in the steel mill’s underground bunkers, many of them wounded. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long considered the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and Belarus before the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had 169,000-190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land, and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine would never join Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
5/16/2022,"Nine-man Everton imploded to put their Premier League status in doubt. Jarrad Branthwaite and Salomón Rondón were sent off to gift Brentford three points. Strikes from Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison were not enough for Everton, as Brentford took advantage of Branthwaite’s first-half dismissal winning 3-2 thanks to a Séamus Coleman own goal and headers from Yoane Wissa and Rico Henry, who was the victim of Rondón’s late lunge. Goodison Road was packed more than two hours before kick-off with fans awaiting the team bus. Chants and blue smoke engulfed the street. The supporters wanted the players to know the significance of survival and what the club means to them. There was no doubting that when the bus edged through the crowds and players disembarked to walk through the blue haze. Calvert-Lewin quickly showed what Everton have missed for much of this season. Making his first start since 9 April, the striker flicked a long pass back into the path of Richarlison in the third minute. The Brazil forward controlled the ball but had it whipped off his feet by teammate Anthony Gordon on the edge of the box, allowing him to jab a shot at goal which David Raya palmed up in the air for Richarlison to attack but he could only head wide. The home fans were rewarded within 10 minutes when Gordon was tripped on the right flank. The winger dusted himself off to take the free-kick, whipping in a low cross to the front post for Richarlison to attack. Richarlison’s connection was weak at best, but it was enough to divert the ball across Raya into the corner, trickling into the net via a touch from Calvert-Lewin. Cue an eruption, another flare on the pitch and the smell of smoke mixed with optimism. That optimism quickly dissipated in a controversial 10-second spell. Richarlison claimed he deserved a penalty after having his shirt pulled by Kristoffer Ajer in the box but the referee, Michael Oliver, saw nothing illegal in the grappling. Mathias Jensen cleared the ball upfield for Ivan Toney to chase. The poor positioning of Everton’s defence gave the striker a head start. Branthwaite raced behind the striker towards his own goal but he curtailed Toney’s run outside the area by pulling him down, resulting in a red card. There was fury in the ground but VAR saw no reason to overturn either decision, forcing Branthwaite to trudge off. The tension in the stands was transmitted on to the pitch in the 31st minute when Richarlison lay on the ground hoping for treatment. Brentford played on for a period until Christian Eriksen kicked the ball out of play, much to the chagrin of Toney who gave his teammate some stern words of advice on the matter, while being pushed by Adoulaye Doucouré, causing a brief melee between the two sets of players. The mood was not improved when Everton failed to clear a corner, allowing Brentford to rebuild their attack. That resulted in a Wissa cross from the left being diverted into his own net by Coleman’s flicked header to silence Goodison once more. Another Calvert-Lewin flick-on ensured the half ended as it started: with a Richarlison chance. He did not get the opportunity to take aim on this occasion because Mads Bech Sørensen pulled down the Everton player, gifting him a chance from the spot. Amid all the anxiety around the ground, Richarlison stayed calm to slot down the middle. Cue more flares. It was Eriksen who provided the perfect cross for the equaliser. The midfielder whipped a corner to the front post where Wissa found space to flick across goal and beyond Jordan Pickford. Everton’s problems dealing with crosses were becoming clear, which is unsurprising for a team missing a centre-back for the majority of the game. Before Brentford’s supporters had stopped celebrating the leveller, they were ahead. Jensen’s deep cross from the right was attacked with gusto by Henry, one of the smallest players on the pitch. He leapt out of a sea of blue to power a header into the top corner to complete the turnaround. Rondón committed the final act with a ludicrous lunge on Henry late on, having only recently come off the bench to ensure a miserable afternoon for all in blue.",Sport/Football,Everton suffer two red cards as Rico Henry gives Brentford turnaround win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report
5/16/2022,"Pep Guardiola insisted Manchester City’s players will give “all of their lives” against Aston Villa on Sunday after his side’s comeback against West Ham left them needing one more victory to seal a second successive Premier League title. City know that victory against Steven Gerrard’s side will be enough to see off Liverpool’s challenge despite Riyad Mahrez’s failure to seal a comeback win at the London Stadium. Having trailed 2-0 at half-time after Jarrod Bowen struck twice, Jack Grealish and an own goal from Vladimir Coufal enabled City to battle back before Mahrez was denied from the spot by Lukasz Fabianski. Liverpool must now beat Southampton on Tuesday night and hope their former captain Gerrard can inspire his team to produce a result at the Etihad Stadium to have a chance of overhauling their rivals. But with a full house expected as City attempt to win a fourth title in five seasons under their manager, Guardiola is confident that his players can seize the moment. “I can assure you something – that we will give them all of our lives to do it,” he said. “It’s an incredible privilege to have the chance to become champions in front of our people at home and I’m looking forward to it. We will rest for a couple of days and try to be ready for Villa but the positive thing is it’s still in our hands. They are desperate to win it and we have showed that all season. “I have a feeling every time that you win a title that it gets more difficult. But this is what you expect when you are up against a team like Liverpool. We know we can’t make a mistake.” City ended their 44-year wait for a league title thanks to Sergio Agüero’s last-minute goal against Queens Park Rangers on the final day of the 2012 season and also won the title on the final day in 2019 after beating Brighton. Asked whether next weekend could be as dramatic, Guardiola – who admitted he had decided against introducing Ilkay Gündogan at half-time – said he was hoping for a more straightforward afternoon. “Ten years ago belongs to Sergio,” he said. “It’s similar because of the maths. It will be tough because it will be emotional but we will give absolutely everything that we have to win the title. The players have so much desire to win the game. To win the title is not just about how good we are with the ball. Of course that is important but there are many other aspects and we showed that today.” West Ham’s point confirmed that they will at least be in the Europa Conference League next season as their captain, Mark Noble, was given a rousing send-off after 18 years at the club. David Moyes said he was delighted with the performance of his team and backed Bowen to receive his first England call-up when Gareth Southgate names his next squad. “It’s not for me to pick the England team but I think he is doing as well as anyone in England. I thought his two goals today were fabulous,” Moyes said. “I want to try and build - next season will be hard but for us to have European football again will be fantastic.”",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola promises City will give ‘all of their lives’ to retain league,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/pep-guardiola-promises-city-will-give-all-of-their-lives-to-retain-league
5/16/2022,"On Saturday, 18-year-old Payton Gendron parked his car in front of the entrance to a Tops Supermarket in a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York. Exiting the car wearing metal armor and holding an assault rifle, he shot and killed a female employee in front of the store, and a man packing groceries into the trunk of his car. After entering the store, he murdered the store’s guard, and by the end of his killing spree, he had shot 13 people, killing 10 of them. Eleven of the people he shot were Black, and two were white. As the manifesto he left behind makes clear, this was fully intentional. The first listed goal in his manifesto was to “kill as many blacks as possible”. Gendron was a meticulous planner. He live-streamed his massacre, and the video begins with him following to the letter the beginning of the plan he lays out in the manifesto.. But the manifesto – which is meant to inspire and instruct subsequent attacks – also outlines the ideology that inspired the murders. Gendron was motivated by a classic version of White Replacement Theory, the view that a cabal of global elites is trying to destroy white nations, via the systematic replacement of white populations. According to White Replacement Theory, the strategies employed by these “global elites” include the mass immigration of supposedly “high fertility” non-whites, and encouraging intermingling between members of non-white races and whites. Gendron was deeply influenced by a series of recent mass killers who were animated by white replacement theoryincluding Brenton Tarrant, whom Gendron openly acknowledges as his model. In Christchurch, New Zealand, Tarrant massacred 51 people at a Mosque in the name of White Replacement Theory, also live-streaming his actions. Gendron’s manifesto begins in a similar fashion to Tarrant’s, by decrying the “white genocide” that will result from the supposedly low fertility rates of white populations and the high fertility rates of non-white immigrants brought in to “replace” them. It is more openly anti-Black than Tarrant’s manifesto – it is a deeply American version, with roots in Jim Crow and lynching. It is also vastly more explicitly antisemitic. Ten pages of Gendron’s manifesto are devoted to arguing for a genetic basis for the racial IQ gap, as well as (ironically) a genetic basis for higher rates of violent crime. It’s clear that Gendron closely follows various academic debates about race, IQ, and crime. According to the ideology guiding Gendron, Black people are not intelligent enough to engineer the replacement of whites, and the destruction of their civilization. The real actors behind White Replacement, according to Gendron, are the Jews, a topic which occupies the subsequent 29 pages of his manifesto. Gendron’s lengthy section on Jews purports to document Jewish hatred of non-Jews. It includes a section of Talmud quotes supporting Gendron’s thesis that Jews hate Christians, and a section documenting supposed control of academia, media, and industry (focusing on the pharmaceutical industry). Gendron ties Jews to child abuse and pedophilia. The section mocks a supposed Jewish fixation on environmental causes of Black crime. Gendron argues that Jews are behind Black social and political movements and organizations, including the NAACP and Black Lives Matter. Gendron also argues that Jews are behind the movement for transgender inclusivity, supposedly sponsoring transgender summer camps for “Scandinavian style whites”. The section ends by blaming Jews for creating “infighting” between people and races. The example Gendron’s manifesto provides is that “Jews are spreading ideas such as Critical Race Theory and white shame/guilt to brainwash Whites into hating themselves and their people”. The ideology that motivated Gendron’s mass murder in Buffalo, White Replacement Theory, has a lengthy and blood-soaked 20th century history. Since 2011, it has been the explicit motivation for over 160 murders, including Norway’s Anders Breivik’s slaughter of 77 people, mostly immigrants, in 2011, Dylann Roof’s mass murder of Black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, the Tree of Life Synagogue killings in 2018, and the murder of 23 people, mostly immigrants, in El Paso, Texas, in 2019. Mass atrocities do not occur in a vacuum. They are enabled by a present normalization of a lengthy previous history, a process that the philosopher of mass killing Lynne Tirrell labels the social embeddedness condition. White Replacement Theory was the dominant structuring narrative of Nazi ideology. Adolf Hitler also announced his genocidal intent in a lengthy manifesto about the supposed Jewish threat to white civilization, entitled Mein Kampf, which was published in 1924. Hitler also was obsessed by mass immigration, and the threat it posed to “white civilization.” Currently, White Replacement Theory has been mass popularized and normalized, perhaps chiefly by the American political commentator Tucker Carlson. It is rapidly moving to the center of the mainstream narrative of America’s Republican party. In this form, it appears stripped of its explicit connection to antisemitism. You will not find Tucker Carlson asserting that the Jews are behind the mass replacement of American whites that he bemoans regularly in what is regularly the most watched cable news show in the United States among adults 25-54. But what Carlson has been doing is spending an entire year repeating a conspiracy by Christopher Rufo that says that American education has been infected by a pro-Black ideology (CRT) that was created by German Jewish Marxist intellectuals (the Frankfurt School). And that while the CRT version of this conspiracy theory is new, it is a direct descendent of the “cultural marxism” conspiracy theory, which was a primary topic of Breivik’s manifesto. The fact that Carlson does not mention American Jews as a target by name should be cold comfort to American Jews. Every single right wing anti-Semite in America who watches Tucker Carlson’s show hears him as denouncing Jews when he regularly platforms the 20th century’s worst anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. Some American Jews hope that by identifying as white, and lending their support to racist narratives about IQ and crime, they can diminish rightwing American antisemitism. This is a terrible error. American Ku Klux Klan ideology in the 1920s strongly overlapped with Nazi ideology, placing Jews at the center of a conspiracy fomenting a supposed race war to overthrow white civilization. American Jews who support Tucker Carlson and his ilk, that is, others who repeat the White Replacement narrative, are supporters both of anti-Black racism, and antisemitism in its most violent form. It is in the tracts of the 20th century’s most explicit antisemites that we find the development of White Replacement Theory, who used it to justify the mass killing of Jews. Gendron’s manifesto reveals yet again the unbreakable historical link between anti-Black racism and antisemitism. Any supporter of White Replacement Theory is a clear enemy of the Jewish People. America has many mass shootings. But this mass killing of Black Americans in a Buffalo supermarket must serve as a wake-up call to our country. White Replacement Theory is deeply ingrained in the worst aspects of American and European history. With its attacks on “Critical Race Theory”, this is a fact that the American political right is deliberately and knowingly trying to erase from our collective consciousness, so they can appeal to it again as a political weapon against liberal democracy. As Gendron’s manifesto makes clear, White Replacement Theory is not just an attack on minorities. It is a weapon directed by fascists at American democracy itself.",Opinion/Opinion,Buffalo shooting: how white replacement theory keeps inspiring mass murder | Jason Stanley,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/15/buffalo-shooting-white-replacement-theory-inspires-mass
5/16/2022,"Residents of a remote Indigenous community who have been left to drink uranium-contaminated water for a decade will get a new treatment plant by the end of the year under a plan by the Northern Territory government to address the issue. Details of the project were revealed in a statement to the Australian stock exchange by engineering firm Clean TeQ Water, which announced it had signed a $5m contract in March to build an ion-exchange water filtration system for the 350-person community at Laramba. The Clean TeQ Water CEO, Willem Vriesendorp, directed questions to Northern Territory’s Power and Water Corporation but said in the statement the contract “demonstrates the development of our company in delivering larger and more complex plants. “The global need for groundwater treatment technologies is increasing [due to] economic activity, climate change, declining ground water levels and increasing pollution from natural sources, agriculture, and industry,” the statement said. Design of the system is currently under way and the “practical completion of the plant” is expected by 16 December 2022. The Central Lands Council CEO, Lesley Turner, said residents of Laramba had so far been left without details of the treatment plant and had been forced to pay for bottled water while they wait. “Minister Chansey Paech announced this filtration system in Laramba last October and told the community it would take 40 weeks to install,” Turner said. “Residents want to know why no work has started yet and why they still have no details about the technology. They also asked the government to supply Laramba with uncontaminated drinking water for those 40 weeks. “These are some of Australia’s poorest people, forced to shell out $12 for a box of safe drinking water that barely fills a few billies each. “We have been told the community will receive free, uncontaminated water at some stage, but the residents need urgent answers about when this will start.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The development comes as the community awaits the result of a legal challenge to a Northern Territory Civil and Administrative Tribunal decision in July 2020 that found landlords had no obligation to install filter taps in homes to ensure water was safe to drink. In Laramba the NT government is both landlord and supplies drinking water to the community. A decision is expected on Monday. The presence of uranium in Laramba’s water supply has been known since at least 2008 but the scale of the issue was only confirmed in 2018 when testing by Power and Water Corporation found concentrations of uranium at 0.046mg/L. This was nearly three times the limit of 0.017mg/L recommended in the Australian drinking water guidelines published by the National Health and Medical Research Council. Follow-up testing in 2020 found the problem was getting worse as uranium concentrations – which occur naturally in the area – had risen to 0.052mg/L. The water also contained contaminants such as nitrate and silica. In response to media pressure the NT government announced $28m in April 2021 to find “tailored” solutions for water issues in remote Aboriginal communities across the territory. Drinking water in remote Indigenous communities within the Northern Territory is managed by Indigenous Essential Services (IES), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the government-owned utility company Power and Water Corporation (PWC). IES has no staff, no offices and pays a fee to its parent company for administration services. During the community’s recent legal challenge, the NT government filed a fact sheet published by PWC as evidence. It said the company planned to build an “ion-exchange water treatment system” in Laramba that “has been proven to work in a similar environment in a remote Western Australian community”. The system operates by binding uranium ions with a resin to clean the water. It also said PWC “is getting approvals from Department of Health and the NT Environment Protection Authority” on the project. Guardian Australia contacted both NT Health and the EPA, but neither had received an application for approvals on the treatment plant. NT Health said PWC was “undertaking an assessment” about how to classify wastewater from the plant. “This classification will determine if approvals are required from NT Health,” it said.

When Guardian Australia asked PWC about the situation at Laramba in October last year, it could not confirm any work had taken place. Around that time representatives from PWC travelled to the Pilbara in Western Australia on a fact-finding trip to visit the remote community of Yandeyarra, where an ion-exchange water treatment plant has been operating for about 10 years. PWC was contacted for comment but declined to comment. The NT minister for essential services and water security, Eva Lawler, was expected to make an announcement regarding the water treatment plant this week.",News/Australia news,Remote NT community not told about $5m contract to fix uranium in water supply,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/remote-nt-community-not-told-about-5m-contract-to-fix-uranium-in-water-supply
5/16/2022,"The New South Wales government has refused to pass laws closing a loophole that allows prison staff to treat children in youth detention as adults, including the use of “oppressive” fully-naked-body strip-searches. The NSW Ombudsman, Paul Miller, has invoked his rarely used power to force ministers to respond to his investigation into the use of adult strip-search powers against children, saying he was not satisfied the government had taken sufficient steps to address his calls for the law to be overhauled. Last year, Miller furnished a special report to parliament detailing a case in 2019 when three children in a youth detention centre were subjected to a strip-search in which they were made to completely undress and spread apart their buttocks. The search occurred in a room monitored by CCTV. In NSW, youth justice officers are only able to conduct partial strip-searches – meaning children in detention cannot be searched while naked. Youth justice rules also ban the use of a strip-search in view of CCTV. But the report raised concerns that a memorandum of understanding signed between youth justice and corrective services NSW allowed for those laws to be circumvented. The 2019 MOU allowed corrective services staff from the general prison population to enter children’s detention centres during a “riot or disturbance”. The wording of that agreement, the ombudsman found, allowed corrections staff to “bring with them all the same powers for the children and young people as they have for adult prisoners in an adult correctional centre”. “In effect, the youth justice centre becomes legally ‘cloaked’ as an adult correctional centre for so long as the CSNSW officers have control of it, so that the children and young people in that centre may lawfully be treated by those officers in the same way,” the report last year found. But the government has refused to implement the recommendations to overhaul the laws to ban the use of fully naked body searches on children, a decision the ombudsman has now forced them to explain to the state’s parliament. In a rare use of the ombudsman’s powers to demand further explanation from the government, Miller published a second report on the issue late last week saying changes introduced by the government did not address the problem. The 2019 search of the three children was “oppressive”, “disproportionate to the risk posed”, and “unreasonable”, the ombudsman found. Officers from corrective services were called to the Frank Baxter Youth Justice Centre after a disturbance in which the three young people had climbed on to the roof of a building and “made a series of serious threats to the safety of staff”. They were eventually convinced to come down from the building, where they were handcuffed and subjected to pat-down searches which did not find anything. Officers then conducted a fully naked body strip-search which required the children to completely undress. The ombudsman found a number of steps during the search were “unnecessary and inconsistent with policy”, and would not have usually been permitted under rules governing youth detention centres. The report found, for example, that officers inspected between the buttocks of one of the children, and instructed him to “lift his penis”. “Fully-naked-body (FNB) strip searches of children and young people are neither necessary nor appropriate and do not reflect good public policy,” Miller found in his special report. “In our view, the practice of FNB strip searching of young people is not consistent with the principles of trauma-informed practice, as an FNB strip search is almost always a confronting and humiliating experience.” In the report Miller made a number of recommendations aimed at closing a loophole which allowed the fully naked body searches under the remit of the MOU. The government, he said, should pass laws to “expressly prohibit” fully-naked-body searches of children and young people in detention as well as amending existing laws to ensure partial-body searches used “the least intrusive method required to achieve the purpose of the search”. But the government rejected those recommendations. In a joint-reply to last year’s report, the then corrections minister Anthony Roberts and minister for families and community services, Alister Henskens SC, said they did not support any legislative changes. Instead, the government said the MOU had been updated to give “additional guidance about the respective roles and responsibilities” of corrective services officers called to youth justice centres during cases of disturbances. But in his latest report, Miller found that under the terms of the new MOU corrections officers can still conduct fully naked body strip-searches on children. The new MOU, Miller wrote, states that the searches can be conducted in cases where a “risk” is identified, but “provides no guidance as to the circumstances that might constitute such a risk or who is to make that decision”. The new MOU also contains no requirement for officers to record why the search was conducted, he found. Under the policies corrective service officers are now required to have reasonable grounds before undertaking a partially clothed strip-search on a young person, but not a fully naked body search. Under the powers used by the ombudsman, the government is now required to give an explanation to parliament about its response to the report. In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for the department of communities and justice said that it was working through the ombudsman’s report. The government is in the process of rolling out body scanner technology that it says will reduce the need for strip searches in youth detention centres. The spokesperson said the scanners were being rolled out “across all youth justice centres in NSW to improve safety and security for detainees and for staff”. “Youth Justice staff carry out partially clothed body searches to keep centres safe,” the spokesperson said. “At all times Youth Justice works to ensure the security and safety of Youth Justice centres, detainees and staff.”",News/Australia news,NSW government refuses to close legal loophole allowing prison staff to strip-search children,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/nsw-government-refuses-to-close-legal-loophole-allowing-prison-staff-to-strip-search-children
5/16/2022,"Julia Gillard has contributed a rare campaign endorsement for Katy Gallagher – the shadow finance minister – an intervention underscoring Labor’s concern that the high profile independent David Pocock could split the progressive vote in Canberra. The former prime minister has written to the residents of the Australian Capital Territory and recorded a video endorsement for Gallagher, a former chief minister, who holds one of the territory’s two Senate spots. For the past 50 years, the two ACT Senate spots have been held by the Labor and Liberal parties but in 2022, two high-profile progressive independents, Pocock, a former rugby union star player, and constitutional law professor Kim Rubenstein are vying to replace the Liberal incumbent, Zed Seselja. The independent campaigns have high visibility around the national capital and both Pocock and Rubenstein are well known locally. Labor strategists believe Pocock now has sufficient momentum to imperil Gallagher’s re-election bid in the event traditional Labor voters choose to mark him No 1 on the Senate ballot paper. The current Labor ACT chief minister Andrew Barr took to social media last week to tell residents he would be putting his own party at No 1 on the Senate ballot paper and Pocock at No 2 because it would be “great” if the two territory senators would back territory rights in the federal parliament. Barr noted that Labor was prepared to facilitate a vote in both the House and the Senate to lift the ban on territories legislating on euthanasia and “wouldn’t it be great if both ACT Senators voted in favour of territory rights – that’s why I’ll be voting 1 Labor and 2 Pocock”. Gillard says in the new letter to residents she doesn’t usually “talk about politics” but Gallagher deserves the continuing support of the people of Canberra. “There’s been a lot of talk about independents recently,” Gillard says. “What our federal parliament needs is more strong, experienced women. And that’s why I believe the choice you face this election matters so much.” She says the voters of Canberra “have the opportunity to make sure we keep one of our best, brightest and strongest women in the Senate”. “Katy Gallagher is more than just a good friend to me, she is a strong advocate for the values that matter to Canberrans,” Gillard says. Gillard notes Gallagher’s positive record on Canberra’s transition to 100% renewable energy and her support for a federal anti-corruption body. The former prime minister notes if Labor wins the coming election, Gallagher will be the finance minister in an Albanese government. “That’s why I would encourage you to ask yourself this question before you cast your vote – can I really risk losing someone like Katy from the Senate? To me, the answer is clear, and that’s why I’m asking you to put Katy Gallagher number 1 on the Senate ballot paper”. Pocock in a recent interview with Guardian Australia said there was frustration in the city about being ignored because “we are such a safe seat, as a result of that we’ve had a huge underinvestment in infrastructure”. The high-profile independent, who has received funding from the Climate 200 group, has been the target of a negative advertising campaign run by the rightwing advocacy group, Advance Australia, centring on his record of environmental activism. A recent Redbridge robo-phone survey of voting intentions which was funded by the Pocock campaign had Labor at 27%, followed by the Liberals at 24% and Pocock at 21%.",News/Australia news,Julia Gillard makes rare appearance to back Katy Gallagher as Labor fears David Pocock upset,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/julia-gillard-makes-rare-appearance-to-back-katy-gallagher-as-labor-fears-david-pocock-upset
5/16/2022,"A sunny Tuesday morning in mid-May and Amey Soo is on what she calls the “baby walk” along the water in the inner-west Sydney suburb of Drummoyne. As kayakers and fishers fiddle around on the boat ramp, she stands in the shade with her newborn in a carrier and contemplates her vote in the marginal electorate of Reid. She usually votes for the Liberal party, she tells Guardian Australia, but won’t be this time. She would have liked to support an independent, like the teal candidates running in the seats of Wentworth and North Sydney, but doesn’t see an obvious alternative. She is still “not too sure” about Labor, she says, but thinks they’re “the least of the evils”. So, why the change? “Because of Scott Morrison,” she says. Held by the Liberal party on a margin of just 3.2%, Reid is one of a few key NSW seats being targeted by Labor as it seeks to win government on 21 May. Internally, the party is confident of winning the seat, held by the moderate Liberal party MP Fiona Martin. But Labor has seen this movie before. In 2019 it also held high hopes Reid would flip, running the former McKell Institute executive director Sam Crosby. Instead, the seat’s margin barely shifted, one of a number of disappointments for Labor on the night. In 2022, western Sydney is, as always, a tantalising prospect for both major parties. As Labor hunts Reid, the Coalition believes it is in with a chance in the neighbouring seat of Parramatta, where Labor has preselected the economist Andrew Charlton, a former adviser to Kevin Rudd who was parachuted into the seat despite opposition from the local party. A diverse electorate which covers Sydney’s second CBD and the surrounding suburbs of Granville, Toongabbie, Dundas and Harris Park, Parramatta has been held by Labor since 2004. It has a high proportion of Arabic-speaking residents, as well as voters of Indian, Chinese and Lebanese descent. The local member, Julie Owens, is retiring, and the prime minister has made a series of appearances in the electorate alongside the Liberal party candidate, Maria Kovacic, who he has dubbed “the real eel” because of her support for the local rugby league club. The Coalition hopes Labor’s decision to install Oxford-educated Charlton, who lived in the ritzy eastern suburb of Bellevue Hill, will backfire. But voters who spoke to Guardian Australia for this piece either weren’t aware of the local candidates, or else were not worried. At a playground in Parramatta Park, Hannah Graham has just read an article in Sydney tabloid the Daily Telegraph about Charlton failing to name three favourite restaurants in the area. She hasn’t decided who she will vote for, and said the article didn’t sway her. “I don’t think it really matters that he’s not from here,” she says. “I’ve gone for jobs before where I didn’t know the company. I don’t think that means you’re not able to do the job necessarily.” Others are similarly inclined. In Harris Park, a suburb outside Parramatta with a large Indian-Australian population, Ramesh Vyas and his two friends Dinesh and Chiman Patel are all voting for Labor. “Mr Charlton!” they all echo when asked who they’re voting for. “Good man. He came to our temple. We love Charlton too much,” Vyas says. Hamna Amaan, from Guildford, hasn’t heard of either of the local candidates, but is nonetheless also supporting Labor. “I just like, favour them, with what they’re advocating,” she says. So too do Irfan Azhar, a construction worker from Granville who says he doesn’t trust the Liberal party, and Moses Nassar, who, while running his fingers over a set of rosary beads outside a Lebanese cafe in Harris Park, says he still loves Gough Whitlam. “I talked to [Andrew Charlton] last week,” he says. “He was here. I support Labor all the time. Labor gives a chance a little bit to the poor people. Liberal for rich people.” If that sounds bad for the Coalition, it certainly wasn’t the only impression. Voters like Louie El Azzi said he was voting for Morrison because he felt “comfortable” with him as prime minister. Varun Dabas was one of many who said he was voting for the Coalition because he believes they handled the Covid-19 pandemic well. Many others remained undecided, uninterested, or unsure about Albanese. Manorm Prasad thinks Morrison is “good”, and nominates education and safety as her two issues. But, like many first-generation Australians in Parramatta who Guardian Australia spoke to, she said she would ask her children for advice about who to vote for. “Definitely, they’re going to tell me what to do, because I have no idea and they are more educated than me,” she says. And so back to Reid. Stretching from the wealthy inner-west suburbs of Drummoyne and Five Dock to diverse, densely populated Strathfield and out to the true west around Lidcombe and Homebush, campaigning in Reid requires a deft touch. “It’s three different electorates,” Labor’s candidate, Sally Sitou, says. In the leafy bayside suburbs in and around Drummoyne, voters tend to have more in common with the wealthy eastern suburbs, where independents like Allegra Spender are causing headaches for moderate Liberal MPs. Usually a Liberal-dominated voting area, many residents here cite climate change and a federal integrity commission as key issues. Soo is one of them. She calls Morrison a “hypocrite”, who has embarrassed Australia internationally by dragging his feet on climate action. She cites a series of billboards organised by comedian Dan Ilic before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow which satirised Australia’s record on emissions reductions. “It just makes a mockery of Australia,” she says. “[He] just makes us look like we want to sell coal to anyone and everyone when we’re not – we’re not like that.” She is not alone. Also on his morning walk is retiree Vaughn Kirkby. Another longtime Liberal party supporter, he’s feeling particularly torn as the election approaches. Kirkby likes the local Liberal party MP, Fiona Martin, and supported her crossing the floor to oppose the government’s religious discrimination bill. “She represents my views,” he says of Martin. Kirkby doesn’t rate the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, and he hasn’t been impressed by the opposition generally – “I think there’s a lot of lightweights” – and yet, he’s still not sure he can bring himself to vote for Morrison. “He’s a grub,” Kirkby says. “He’s just, you know, he’s marketing. He’s thin.” Not everyone agrees, of course. Fiona Sarkis, a lawyer from the neighbouring suburb of Russell Lea, thinks Morrison is unfairly criticised, and appreciates the job he did in guiding the country through the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic. “I know people whinge about bits and pieces, but really, in the scope of things he’s done pretty good,” she says. “I didn’t not work a day. My kid had daycare looked after. My husband had his job in construction. I look at myself and my family, [we were] all pretty safe during Covid.” For Sitou, an academic who lives in Homebush in the electorate, campaigning in the seat has meant juggling a mishmash of local issues which vary widely. While voters in Drummoyne might cite climate change as a key issue, head a little farther west and the issues on voters’ minds tend to stick to the central theme of the campaign: cost of living. “It’s really distinct,” she says. “Any smart campaign, you’ve got to target your messaging and issues you want to shine a light on. Overwhelmingly, the feedback I’m getting when I’m out doorknocking is different areas have different concerns.” In Burwood, Shelley Tan, a nurse, isn’t feeling full of confidence about Albanese, but says she’ll vote for Labor because she believes the party will do more to help lift wages. “We need a pay rise,” she says. “[Albanese] is not the greatest, but I’ve got no other choice, do I? I don’t want to vote for Scott Morrison.” That same sentiment pops up over and over again as you speak to voters across the west of Sydney. They may not like Scott Morrison, but they’re hardly overwhelmed with enthusiasm for what Labor is offering. It would also concern the opposition to hear that while many voters who Guardian Australia speaks to have listed healthcare – traditionally one of the party’s strengths – as a priority, they aren’t necessarily linking that to a Labor vote. Lucy, from Burwood, who declines to give her last name as she runs after her grandchildren through the park, is also a nurse. She wants the government to invest more money in healthcare, but also says she “trusts” Morrison to improve the sector. “Maybe I will choose Morrison, but I think after I choose him I hope something can improve,” she says. Reid has one of the highest Chinese-Australian voting populations in the country, and concern about the Morrison government’s handling of the relationship between both countries is also an issue that pops up repeatedly. “I’ve had enough with Scott,” Li Wu from Strathfield says. Wu voted for the Liberal party at the last election, but says she’s switching her vote as a result of the worsening trade standoff between both nations. “I really want the government to fix the relationship with China. That’s all,” she says. Sitou says it’s an issue that has continued to pop up during the campaign. She says the concern about “heightened rhetoric” around China is also pragmatic. “The main concern is the impact the heightened rhetoric has on people’s lives and also small businesses,” she said. “There’s quite a lot of small businesses in Burwood that have relationships with China, [and] their concern is what is this heightened rhetoric means for us and for our businesses.” But it’s also true that as you head into Reid’s more diverse pockets, the traditional attack lines on the prime minister that have been baked into mainstream discourse – Scotty from Marketing, the Liar from the Shire – seem less relevant. Sabita Banik and her husband, Subrata, both general practitioners from Strathfield, are eating lunch at Oporto in Strathfield as they explain that they don’t want to vote. Sabita is concerned about the cost of living because, she says, “the cost of everything is going up, but not our salaries”, but she doesn’t know anything about Albanese. On Morrison? “I like him. I see Scott all the time. I see his Facebook. His cooking. Cooking Indian dishes,” she says. Ashay Parulekar, who is voting in his first federal election after becoming a citizen, tells Guardian Australia he is voting for the Coalition in part because of the strength of the economy, and because of the government’s fostering of ties with India. “Definitely the relations with India and Australia has strengthened over the years,” he said. Parulekar came to Australia in 2015 and says he has seen “a drastic change” in the relationship between India and Australia. “The relations have gone amazing [since then].”",News/Australia news,"Undecided, uninterested, unsure: major parties vie to flip long-held seats of Reid and Parramatta",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/undecided-uninterested-unsure-major-parties-vie-to-flip-long-held-seats-of-reid-and-parramatta
5/16/2022,"Leon Cameron coached his last game on Sunday. He choked up as he addressed his players beforehand. He told them he had no silverware, but no regrets. “I’ll tell you the same thing I told you on day one,” he said. ‘She’s on.” But when Carlton slammed on four goals in the first 10 minutes, she was over. Afterwards, Cameron limped through a guard of honour of the league chief executive and both teams. He looked relieved. He looked exhausted. He is nearly 50, and has worked full time in football since he was 16. Coaching was “zapping”, he said. It was time to do something else with his life. The end of coaching tenures aren’t the savage affairs they used to be. They used to come with years of recrimination and bitterness. Wounds would never be healed. Many men were completely lost to football. These days, they’re cleaner. They’re mutual decisions. The coach isn’t sacked, and doesn’t quit. All parties read which way the wind is blowing. The departing press conference is amicable. Brad Scott’s departure at North Melbourne was in many ways the template, and at times almost felt like a job application. Cameron’s record was very good. He had lots of injuries and homesick players. But the Giants contended year after year. They were so close in the 2016 preliminary final, narrowly going down in one of the great games of the modern era. They were never really a ‘system’ team, particularly down back. But when they were really humming, they played some exquisite football. At times, it was like watching a flawless training session. They were an uncompromising, hard-nosed, line-pushing lot. In several finals – against Sydney in 2016 and the Bulldogs in 2019 – they brutalised their opposition. They had a knack of winning finals when no one gave them a prayer, most memorably against Collingwood in the 2019 preliminary final. In the dying minutes, they defended like crazy men in the puddles at the Punt Road end. When the siren sounded, the crowd groaned, an almighty brawl broke out in the Olympic Stand, and the Giants celebrated the most significant win in their history to a silent and sullen MCG. But they’ve been paddling this year. They put Adelaide to the sword a fortnight ago, but have otherwise been flat, unconvincing and in desperate need of a reset. Toby Greene’s brain fade in Tasmania last year cost them dearly. Against Geelong in Canberra, Cameron said they were boring. That was the game where he and the club knew it was the end of the road. They came to a mutual agreement. This is an industry, as the Giants boss said, that “death-rides coaches”. But his was a dignified end. The entire playing list, friends and family gathered around him. They’ve always been a club with a purpose, a hard edge and an identifiable brand. A lot of the credit for that should go to Cameron. In terms of securing a new coach, GWS now has a head-start on the competition. Nathan Buckley ruled himself out on the weekend. Astonishingly, James Hird is seen as a serious contender. But Alastair Clarkson is the name on football’s lips. At times, the obsession with Clarkson can be a bit much. Football history is littered with examples of coaches who were seen as Messiah figures, were lured with bucketloads of cash and didn’t work out. Some believe he lost his way in his final years at Hawthorn, that he gutted the list and their football was at times bordering on unwatchable. “I’m only coming back for another premiership,” he said this week. He reckons all 18 clubs are capable of winning a flag in the next few years. It’s a big call for anyone who watched Essendon or North Melbourne on the weekend. Essendon, in particular, looked like a team which could use a few Clarkson home truths on Saturday night. They registered a paltry 30 tackles. If he was coaching them, you suspect he’d have them leaping off freezing piers at five in the morning. Right now, Clarkson is having a whale of a time. He played Jeff Kennett and Hawthorn like a harp. They’re still paying him handsomely to swan around the world – studying, spruiking the game, rubbing shoulders with some of the best coaches in America. He can name his own price at any number of clubs. He has months to figure out what he wants to do, where he wants to live and whose playing list he fancies shipping into shape. A short man, he looms large over the entire competition.",Sport/Sport,Leon Cameron’s dignified GWS Giants exit fits his treasured tenure | Leon Cameron,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/16/leon-camerons-dignified-gws-giants-exit-fits-his-treasured-tenure
5/16/2022,"To marquee or not to marquee? That is the question for A-Leagues operators the Australian Professional Leagues. Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and Covid chaos, or to take arms against a sea of troubles? A key pillar in the league’s short-term strategy to emerge from its horror 2021-22 campaign was unveiled mid-week, as APL managing director Danny Townsend revealed that a list of 35 potential “world-class” signings had been earmarked by the league as potential “sugar hits” for what is hoped will be a reinvigorating 2022-23. It all sounds like something from a Hollywood film, Townsend sitting down with clubs and putting together a team to save the (A-Leagues) world. Yet surveying the landscape, it is easy to see why the immediate bounce which would come with this strategy is being pursued. Battling waning interest and emotional investment even before being buffeted by Covid headwinds that ripped their best-laid plans to pieces, none of the A-Leagues 12 men’s teams averaged more than 10,000 attendees this season and television ratings and fan interest have waned to dangerously low levels. What better way to drum up immediate curiosity than borrowing someone else’s fame? Per its executive, the APL will work with clubs this off-season to determine positions of need in their men’s or women’s teams before supporting them in signing a figure who both addresses this need and brings that sweet nectar of mainstream notoriety. These individuals would be recruited with both an understanding and contractual requirement that not only would they be providing their on-field talents, but also serving in an ambassadorial role – avoiding previous circumstances wherein marquee signings have been reluctant to do any media, which somewhat defeats the point. Now, with all this talk of sugar, the appeal of diving into the impending free-agent list on Transfermarkt and devolving into a sokkah version of Veruca Salt is a powerful one. “I want a Gareth Bale, Danny,” clubs may cry. “And I want a Cesc Fàbregas, and a Zlatan Ibrahimović.” And any such arrivals would be a positive, anything that would boost the league’s reputation right now would be. But Australian football has had a long and not always fruitful relationship with the marquee signing, the global superstar brought to these shores in an attempt to bathe the local game in the reflected glow of an already-established reputation and celebrity. At its core, they effectively boil down to endorsement deals, only instead of taking cash to spruik the benefits of petro-states with dubious human rights records or non-fungible tokens, the player in question is providing their endorsement of a footballing club and the league in which it plays. This inevitably carries some level of sacrifice on the part of the signing beyond a standard relocation; acknowledgement that they are now not so much a footballer who resides on the game’s biggest stage and more a brand deployed on rescue missions to its fringes. Some simply are not ready to do this, and others demand a significant premium for doing so. On occasion, it works great. Alessandro Del Piero at Sydney FC, Shinjo Ono at Western Sydney and Emile Heskey at Newcastle coincided with the A-League’s (unironic) peak. Crowds swelled and the mainstream couldn’t get enough. But these tenures ultimately did little to arrest the alarming backsliding in the years that followed after the rush from their presence wore off. The crescendo in the league’s active support and high point in technical and tactical approaches from teams that underpinned the Del Piero epoch was not fostered by the then Football Federation Australia. The governing body quandered a golden opportunity for the league to stand on its own feet. Now, Townsend insists the foundations now exist in the A-Leagues to allow the competition to capitalise on the sugar rush to come. And the APL is free to spend its money however it likes. It spent years telling the public it had the means and wherewithal to invest and invest well. Caveat emptor. New or old fans will enjoy bright lights, no doubt, and some will likely stick around. That’s good. But inevitably, the dwindling number of rusted-ons will at some point want more. And this is where the questions come in. Is the APL, in what would be a break with local tradition, capable of following through on a long-term strategy that would grow the game and allow the league to stand on its own two feet? Is there recognition of what fundamentally underpins the product (that’s the football bit) and how everything, ultimately, flows from that? For all the talk of data lakes and prevailing commercial eco-spaces, how will the emotional, irrational connection that underpins fans and their teams be fostered? Is the broadcaster at some point going to stop alienating fans trying to pay for and watch the product? These, among other topics, are the A-Leagues’ vegetables. It’s free to have all the sugar it wants and in the short term, will enjoy and probably benefit from the rush. At some point, it will have to eat its greens so it can grow up to be big and strong.",Sport/Football,Marquees are tasty sugar hits but A-Leagues must also eat their greens | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/16/marquees-are-tasty-sugar-hits-but-a-leagues-must-also-eat-their-greens
5/16/2022,"“Physician, heal thyself.” This proverb has been in use for at least 2,000 years, but it is relevant today, and it applies to me. I am dealing with burnout, and it has taken many months for me to realise it. The combination of a few years of a heavy workload, of ever-increasing demands, and limited opportunities to rest and recharge have taken their toll. The advent of a global pandemic has clearly contributed to all these factors. The scramble to ready our hospitals for a disease of high infectiousness and severity. The privilege and pain of caring for many who I watched die in 2020. The angst of dealing with vaccine refusers, and wave after wave of Covid cases, and new, often overwhelming demands on myself and my colleagues. They have laid siege to my energy and my empathy. The demands upon many of us in emergency medicine and nursing have to be seen to be believed. Their origins lie in a health system which treats emergency departments as a panacea for all its shortcomings: a disastrous aged care system, a general practice system which discourages the care of complex patients, a mental health system that is woefully under-resourced, and a federal/state health funding system where cost-shifting and finger-pointing are the reality. Emergency physicians have been talking about hospital overcrowding for more than 20 years, and burnout is nothing new among many of my medical, nursing and allied colleagues who have given so much to caring for people in the worst moments of their lives. But the overcrowding, the delays, and the adverse impacts on patients have never been as profound as they are now. Unsurprisingly, morale among my colleagues has taken an enormous hit. Burnout has not happened to me overnight. Rather, it has been a progressive erosion of my usual coping mechanisms, to the point where my physical and mental energy have become so much harder to find. Decisions and procedures that are usually second nature to me, now require considerable effort and cause more angst than they should. Joy has been hard to find, not only in my work – which should be very satisfying – but in most of the activities of my daily life. I cannot be unaffected by seeing people suffer on waiting room floors and ambulance stretchers, when I know I could help, if only I had the space and staff to do so. I am aware of the data that clearly shows that clinicians with burnout are impaired. We are less efficient, and we are much more likely to make mistakes. In my role, mistakes have the potential to be very serious . While many colleagues have been surprised to hear of my situation – I may be good at hiding personal distress – I have come to understand the impact of burnout on the people I love most. My family. I have often been irritable, distracted, and unable to give all of myself to them in the ways they need and deserve. That is probably the trigger that led me to take the advice of my psychologist, my GP and my emergency physician wife. To deal with my burnout before it deteriorates further. I have been advised to take leave from my clinical work for three months. That has been hard to accept, but I am so grateful to my colleagueswho have been supportive and understanding and sought to assuage the guilt I feel at the prospect of not being there to help with the extreme demands we are experiencing. I have chosen to speak about my circumstances publicly, because I hope that it will give permission to many healthcare workers to give a higher priority to their own self-care. In that, they are being professional and ethical, doing their best to be safe and effective in their work and making their careers sustainable. I speak out because the most enduring solution to healthcare worker burnout is to address the daunting problems in the Australian health system which cause it in the first place. We are in a federal election campaign and yet the offerings of our political leaders for health system reform and enhancement have been evasive or superficial. I hope that changes in the weeks ahead. As I step back from the frontline for a while, I look forward to the rest and reflection that I need. I don’t know how my time away will change me, but I hope to be able to return as a wiser, better man, able to care for many. Including myself.

5/16/2022,"A member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has said he was benched from hearing social security cases because he decided too many against the government. Michael Manetta says the AAT deputy president, Karen Synon, a former Liberal senator, expressed concern in June 2021 about the number of appeals against his decisions by the Department of Social Services before he was benched in September in a bid to increase “consistency” between tribunal members’ decisions. After months of internal complaints Manetta has blown the whistle on a move he called “completely incompatible with the rule of law” that “undermines the impartiality and independence of the tribunal”. Synon told Guardian Australia she categorically denies “any implication or inference that I have acted in any manner that is not fair, impartial and just in the exercise of my statutory duties at the AAT”. The AAT is an independent tribunal that conducts merit reviews of government decisions, such as DSS decisions to refuse welfare payments or to recoup jobseeker and jobkeeper overpayments. The AAT was the forum in which welfare recipients argued against robodebts before the government later conceded after court action that the process of raising debts based on income-averaging was unlawful. Manetta told Guardian Australia “exactly the same” dynamic is at play in a variety of other social security decisions, in which he has rejected the department’s interpretation of the law on a number of points that have never been definitively decided on appeal. Although not on the same “catastrophic” scale of the robodebt scandal, which resulted in the government paying out a $1.8bn settlement, Manetta warned there were many more “unresolved potential time bombs” litigated in the AAT’s social security division. These include what compensation moneys are counted when calculating the preclusion period before an injured person can receive welfare and time limits for the department to recover allegedly overpaid jobseeker and jobkeeper payments. Manetta, a part-time member first appointed in May 2016, said of the 300 decisions he has made, 24 have been appealed, a level he described as “hardly controversial”. Only nine appeals were successful. Manetta was reappointed for a further five-year term in May 2021, after a positive performance review by a retired federal judge, he said. But in June, Synon queried the number of appeals against Manetta’s decisions, he said. “I said it should be a matter of indifference to members whether parties appeal,” he said. “They have a right to do that but I stand by my decisions.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning According to Manetta, he and Synon discussed the possibility of setting up an appeal panel to hear cases involving “errors of law of a recurrent nature” but the idea “came to nothing”. In September, Manetta was removed from social security cases and given only child support cases, which are revenue-neutral for the government. Manetta objected in writing to Synon, the AAT president and later to the acting president. In February 2022, Manetta spoke to Synon about being benched and she said “she was concerned at the high level of my decisions against the department (around 65%) as out of kilter with most of the other members”, he said. “She wanted consistency of decision-making across the division.” But Manetta said that decision was “entirely incompatible with the rule of law”. “We’re independent adjudicative officers. You can’t take sides, you can’t even start with a presumption that the government’s interpretation of the law is probably right.” Manetta also claimed that at this meeting Synon revealed the secretary of the DSS had met with the AAT president and Synon about one of his decisions. Manetta said he was “staggered” a party before the tribunal was given “special access” rather than making representations at the ministerial level. Manetta refused to do only child support work, and was delisted, meaning he is not currently hearing cases despite holding an appointment to May 2026. He complained again to the new AAT president, Justice Fiona Meagher, on 19 April, receiving an acknowledgement but “nothing since”. “I believe that the removal of competent decision-makers because of the trend of their decisions is an affront to fundamental principles of fairness; it undermines the perception of impartiality and independence which is essential to the work of the tribunal; it offends the rule of law and erodes public confidence in the quality of administrative justice.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Manetta, a barrister and former South Australian state Liberal candidate, said his complaint “isn’t about politics”, but it is “essential” that only lawyers should be appointed to the AAT. An AAT spokesperson said “the president is aware of matters raised by member Michael Manetta and these are currently being considered in consultation with deputy president Synon”. Jo Dyer, the independent candidate for Boothby, said Manetta’s complaint “goes to the heart of how this government serves the people of Australia, in this case some of the most vulnerable people … those reliant on social security who believe they have been wronged by the government”. “These people have every right to appeal government decisions … if they do so, they should be able to expect fairness and rely on the rule of law. “After its heroic role in revealing the illegality at the heart of the government’s robodebt scandal … the AAT has now been compromised.” Synon said it was “inappropriate for me to respond to questions about a member within my division” beyond her denial of any improper conduct. The DSS denied meeting with senior tribunal members to discuss. Manetta’s decisions. “This is incorrect,” a spokesperson said. “The secretary of the department has a regular meeting with senior members of the AAT as part of routine of stakeholder engagement to discuss strategic issues and changes in policy that may impact on the AAT.” “There is no discussion about the actions of any member of the AAT or specific cases during these meetings. This would be improper.”",News/Australia news,AAT member says he was benched after too many decisions against government,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/aat-member-says-he-was-benched-after-too-many-decisions-against-government
5/16/2022,"In 1936, during the first heady months of France’s new Popular Front government, a Parisian schoolteacher coined the phrase that symbolised the hopes invested in it. “Tout est possible!” (Everything is possible) wrote Marceau Pivert in an editorial for the Socialist party newspaper of the time. As fascism overwhelmed the continent, it proved a tragically over-optimistic assessment. Divided over how to respond to the threat, by 1938 the leftwing coalition of socialists and communists governing the country had fractiously fallen apart. The challenges facing the contemporary French left pale somewhat in comparison. But they also have to do with problems of unity – or the lack of it – and with the growing popularity of the modern far right. The absence of a united front in the recent presidential race led once more to dispiriting defeat and, in the case of the Socialist party candidate, Anne Hidalgo, outright humiliation. Representing the traditional party of the centre-left, Ms Hidalgo scored a mere 1.75%. The Greens performed marginally better (4.6%), but only the most radical candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, made a fight of it. Campaigning on a hard-left and markedly Eurosceptic platform, Mr Mélenchon almost matched Marine Le Pen’s score in the first round. Some more moderate supporters voted for him as the only leftwing candidate with a realistic chance of success. Something had to be done after the latest disappointment – and was done with surprising rapidity. Ahead of next month’s legislative elections, a new “popular union” has been agreed, which will run a common slate of leftwing candidates. The lion’s share of seats will be contested by Mr Mélenchon’s La France Insoumise party, with Green and Socialist candidates fighting most of the rest. Current polls suggest that the New People’s Ecologist and Social Union (Nupes) has a good chance of becoming the main opposition to President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist bloc in the national assembly. In a political landscape divided almost equally between the left, the centre and the right, the consolidation of the progressive vote is overdue. But this fragile coalition has been formed almost entirely on Mr Mélenchon’s terms. In Paris, for example, which has remained a bastion of the Socialists, Ms Hidalgo’s colleagues will be allowed to contest only two of 20 seats. Senior Socialist figures, such as former French president François Hollande, have voiced dismay at a common programme that pledges to ignore Brussels rules on debt and deficits. Other policies include reintroducing the wealth tax abolished during Mr Macron’s first term, lowering the retirement age to 60, and a price freeze to address the cost of living crisis. It is a radical agenda, some of which is at odds with what the centre-left campaigned for only a few weeks ago. His rivals having performed so poorly, Mr Mélenchon has the Socialists and Greens over a barrel as they seek to salvage something from the wreckage. But it will require impressive diplomatic skills to hold the new grouping together, and it is not clear that La France Insoumise’s leader possesses them. Mr Mélenchon is a charismatic but polarising figure, whose Euroscepticism and hostility to French membership of Nato may be difficult for his new allies to swallow. Divisions may therefore be papered over rather than resolved, but the popular union is nevertheless a positive development. The presidential election campaign was notable for a stark rightwards drift, in relation to race and immigration in particular. As twin economic and environmental crises are confronted, French democracy needs a left that can make its progressive voice count in the public square. It may be a rocky ride to come, but a necessary first step has been taken to achieve that.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the newly united French left: beyond the fragments | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-newly-united-french-left-beyond-the-fragments
5/16/2022,"Police leaders have accused Priti Patel of a “power grab” that would allow the home secretary to intervene in local law enforcement matters and silence chiefs who want to speak out on issues deemed politically sensitive. An extraordinary row has broken out behind the scenes, with police bosses accusing Patel of trying to obtain new powers without parliamentary approval. The vehement backlash from chief constables and police and crime commissioners (PCCs) comes after an attempt by the government to redraft a written protocol that tries to define where the responsibility lies in policing. Parts of the plan have been labelled “profoundly dangerous” anda “power grab threatening operational independence” by one chief constable. Police and crime commissioners, in a private response, described some of the government proposals as “ultra vires”, meaning going beyond the home secretary’s legal authority. The government handed powers over local policing to PCCs as part of its localism agenda a decade ago. But one government proposal makes it easier for the home secretary to intervene in such matters, while another increases the pressure on chiefs and PCCs to answer to the home secretary. A Home Office source with close knowledge of Patel’s thinking rejected the criticism. They said: “It is not a power grab, it is not a threat to operational independence, but making clear whose job and whose responsibility things are in the policing world. Should it not the home secretary’s role be to ask questions?” The row at the top of the criminal justice system in England and Wales centres on the Home Office’s attempt to revise the policing protocol, which was first produced in 2011 and came into force in January 2012. The Home Office draft of its new version, seen by the Guardian, was sent to chief constables and PCCs for their views, with consultation closing on 2 May. It sets out how the government, chief constables and police and crime commissioners should work together. It is widely agreed that, after a decade, updating the original version is a good idea. But the new draft protocol gives the home secretary the right to demand answers from chief constables, which PCCs believe impinges on their role. One chief constable said the protocol “expanded” the home secretary’s role beyond what is written in law. Another said: “It was your party that gave these powers away, if they don’t like it, take it back with legislation through parliament. A lot of chiefs believe the way it is written now is ultra vires. They are angry.” Since Patel became home secretary, her department has wanted more involvement in policing under a policy called “lean in”. The chief constable said: “They use the term leaning in. For the first time, the chiefs are leaning out.” A Home Office source said the changes made sense and expressed bafflement at the opposition. “We are going to write down more clearly whose job is what, who can ask for information and who can do various things,” they said. The 2012 version of the protocol made clear that the introduction of PCCs had “allowed for the Home Office to withdraw from day-to-day policing matters”. The new version, police leaders say, tries to claw back power without parliamentary approval, with Patel and her officials wanting to expand her “legitimate role in holding PCCs and CCs [chief constables] to account”, and thus make it easier to take police leaders to task. The proposed protocol says: “We propose to lower the threshold for home secretary intervention in appropriate circumstances. This would equip the home secretary to intervene earlier as required, thus reducing the risk of failing to deliver effective policing.” Government proposals would also increase pressure on police leaders to provide the home secretary with information that she asks for, which they are not obliged to do. The document says: “In order to ensure that the home secretary is equipped with the information required to respond to the public and parliament, PCCs and CCs should expect the home secretary to ask chief constables for information about policing matters.” In their private response, the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners said: “There is no formal statutory power for the home secretary to require the police and crime commissioner to give information … As such, any attempt to create a legal responsibility for police and crime commissioners to provide information to the home secretary through the protocol would be ultra vires.” Also in the proposed protocol is a demand that chief constables act “in a politically neutral manner”, which has been added to the previous stricture that they must be impartial. This is opposed by chief constables. One chief said they would be “fettered” and unable to comment on public policy that they believe might affect crime fighting – such as the effects of austerity. Another chief said it was so imprecise that they could not publicly speak out on issues of political dispute – such as tougher sentences or opposing the decriminalisation of cannabis, which is supported by some frontline politicians. The elected police and crime commissioners said such a “recentralisation” cannot be done through “amendments to the protocol”. Instead, they said: “Creation of new powers of strategic oversight can only be achieved through primary legislation and must be subject to the full scrutiny that is required of primary legislation.” In another section, they say, the “proposed change seeks to alter the constitutional relationship between the police, the people, and central government, which is one of the great strengths of British policing”. The deep misgivings come despite the protocol’s foreword giving this reassurance: “The protocol cannot create new law, provide actors with powers they do not already have, or take away the discretion of any relevant body to use their existing powers.” It adds: “By updating the protocol, we intend to bring greater clarity to the role of the home secretary in the policing landscape, as well as the role of chief constables, PCCs and police and crime panels.”",News/UK news,Priti Patel accused of ‘power grab’ over new policing proposals,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/15/priti-patel-accused-of-power-grab-over-new-policing-proposals
5/16/2022,"Thirty-nine years after her death, the artist Maeve Gilmore is finally having her first institutional solo show. A display of 20 paintings, selected in consultation with her family and on show at Studio Voltaire in London, reveal her to be a shrewd and loving observer of domestic life, who took particular delight in the playfulness of her children as they lost themselves in gymnastic stunts or in games of dressing-up and cat’s cradle. Gilmore was a painter, writer and illustrator whose early promise in the 1930s was disrupted first by war and then by marriage to Mervyn Peake, author of the Gormenghast trilogy of novels, whose career she put selflessly before her own. She did not shrink from depicting the darker side of the maternal lot, most strikingly in a picture of a small boy clawing for attention at his mother’s skirts while she, bare breasted, holds a flower out of his reach. The shadow of the flower falls on the wall behind her like the silhouette of an axe. But hers is not a story of Cyril Connolly’s “pram in the hall” – of creativity sacrificed to the demands of parenthood. Nor is it a tale of suffocation by the ego of a monstrous artist husband, as told in Charlotte Mendelson’s novel The Exhibitionist. It is more nuanced than that. Gilmore may not have had, or pursued, a public platform, but her artistic drive remained – not least in the murals on the walls of her London home, which have sadly now been lost to the decorative taste of subsequent owners. The works in the show are owned by members of her family under the management of her estate. They are not for sale. Gilmore belongs in the company of women who deserve respect for their artistry, not pity for their disadvantages. Women like her own daughter-in-law, Phyllida Barlow, who married one of the small sons regularly featured in Gilmore’s paintings, the artist Fabian Peake. For decades Barlow combined teaching and motherhood with building up a well-regarded body of work, even though she only found wide acclaim in her 60s. There are many more such success stories on the walls of the Tate Modern, as part of the current Surrealism Beyond Borders exhibition. Two of them, Leonora Carrington and Remedios Varo, were friends who set up a small, female surrealist cell in Mexico City, where they playfully merged art and life, serving their unsuspecting friends omelettes made with human hair, and “caviar” of ink-dyed tapioca, as Joanna Moorhead recorded in a recent biography of Carrington. The Berlin-born artist Méret Oppenheim (a glaring omission from the Tate show) parlayed a convivial Parisian lunch with Pablo Picasso and Dora Maar into a fur-covered cup and saucer. The American surrealist Dorothea Tanning once declared that there was no such thing as women artists. “It’s just as much a contradiction in terms as ‘man artist’ or ‘elephant artist’,” she said. “You may be a woman and you may be an artist, but the one is a given and the other is you.” Four decades after her death, Maeve Gilmore is an artist.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Maeve Gilmore’s art: out from the shadows | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/15/the-guardian-view-on-maeve-gilmores-art-out-from-the-shadows
