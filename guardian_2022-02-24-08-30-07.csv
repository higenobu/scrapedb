2/24/2022,"Antonio Conte has questioned whether he is the right manager to turn Tottenham’s fortunes around after Burnley inflicted their fourth defeat in five games, with the Italian admitting he is “too honest to close my eyes and continue in this way”. The 1-0 defeat courtesy of Ben Mee’s goal after the high of beating Premier League leaders Manchester City on Saturday left Spurs in eighth spot – the same position they were in when Conte replaced Nuno Espirito Santo at the start of November. Tottenham struggled at Turf Moor as they could not cope with a relegation-threatened Burnley side with more desire and, in the end, composure in front of goal to leave Conte dejected.  “No one deserves this type of situation – the club, me, the players and fans,” he said. “But this is the reality. I came in to try to improve the situation in Tottenham but maybe in this moment, I don’t know, I’m not so good to improve the situation. It’s very frustrating because I know we’re working hard, working a lot and trying to get the best out of every single player. Contehas won 11 of his 21 league games in charge since his appointment and revealed his frustration that he has yet to improve results. “I’m trying to do everything to change the situation but the situation is not changing,’ he said. “Someone has to speak about the race for the fourth place, and the reality from the last five games is we have to pay attention to not fight for the relegation zone. This is the truth. this is the reality. “When this type of situation happens, maybe there is something wrong,” Conte added. “I don’t want to close my eyes, I want to take my responsibility, if I have the responsibility. I am open, I am open for every decision because I want to help Tottenham. From the first day I arrived here I want to help Tottenham. I repeat: I am too honest to close my eyes and continue in this way, and also take my salary. But it’s not right in this moment.” If he does leave, it would leave Spurs searching for their third manager of the season. “I want to try to improve the situation and also to make assessment with the club because if we continue in this way, maybe we have to pay great attention because this league we can finish 10th, 12th, 13th the same way that when I arrived here the same position,” said Conte.",Sport/Football,‘Maybe I’m not so good’: Conte questions Tottenham future after Burnley loss,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/23/maybe-im-not-so-good-conte-questions-tottenham-future-after-burnley-loss
2/24/2022,"Trans rights groups have expressed outrage and fear after the Texas state attorney general Ken Paxton called gender-affirming surgeries and medical care “child abuse” and state governor Greg Abbott ordered the Texas department of family and protective services (DFPS) to conduct an investigation into such practices. Abbott said: “There is no doubt that these procedures are ‘abuse’ under Texas law, and thus must be halted. [DFPS] has a responsibility to act accordingly. I’ll do everything I can to protect against those who take advantage of and harm young Texans.”  While the attorney general’s opinion has no legal bearing, rights groups argue it will spread fear and misinformation and Abbott’s move has prompted an outpouring of condemnation – as well as celebratory statements from some social conservatives. “No court here in Texas or anywhere in the country has ever found that gender-affirming care can be considered child abuse,” said the American Civli Liberties Union of Texas in a statement “The opinion released by Paxton cites highly partisan, outdated, and inaccurate information that ignores the consensus of every major medical association and the evidence-based and peer-reviewed standards of care.” “Trans youth continue to be threatened in Texas by state leadership as part of a politically motivated misinformation campaign that harms children,” the statement added. The actions come after a wave of anti-trans bills that failed to materialize in recent years, some of which would have included preventing transgender Texans from using bathrooms according to their gender identity rather than their biological sex, in government buildings and public schools and universities. The first anti-trans bill to pass in Texas, in October 2021, banned public school students from playing on a sports team that they felt matched their gender identity. Instead, they are only permitted to play on sports teams with other members of the same biological sex, as listed on their birth certificates. Texas joined other states like Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia and Florida, when it passed this law. Major US medical organizations, such as the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association, all say that gender-affirming care is medically necessary for transgender young people. Texas’ government has increasingly embraced controversial socially conservative positions in recent years, even as its population has become more diverse and its political leanings have drifted away from being a solid red state. The state has the second highest number of trans people in the US with some 125,350 adults in Texas identifying as transgender, according to a study from the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. California has the largest with 218,400 trans adults. Texas Freedom Network President Val Benavidez told the Austin-American Statesmen newspaper that Abbott’s move could deny “life-saving care for transgender youth”. “Transgender people already experience stigma and discrimination, harassment and violence simply because of who they are,” Benavidez said.",News/US news,Outrage after Texas attorney general calls gender-affirming surgery ‘child abuse’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/23/trans-groups-texas-attorney-general-gender-affirming-surgeries-child-abuse
2/24/2022,"Ralf Rangnick admitted Manchester United’s plan was in the “dustbin” after Atlético Madrid scored on seven minutes before Anthony Elanga’s second half equaliser snatched a draw for the interim-manager’s team in the Champions League last-16 first leg. It means the tie is poised ahead of the return at Old Trafford next month. Yet Rangnick’s decision to pick a central defender Victor Lindelof at right-back instead of Diogo Dalot or Aaron Wan-Bissaka, regulars in the position, backfired when João Felix’s flying header put Atlético ahead at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium.  United then struggled to rally before Elanga, a 75th-minute replacement, became the club’s youngest ever scorer in the knockout phase at 19 years and 302 days. Rangnick said: “After seven minutes we were 1-0 down and the plan was in the dustbin. I knew this was not his [Lindelof’s] best position, when we had Aaron Wan-Bissaka on the ball and Alex Telles [each replacements, later] we had more possession and more assistance from the wings.” The German bemoaned his players’ passivity. “What we played in the first half I still cannot believe. We played without conviction, without aggression and that is why we were struggling,” he said. Rangnick revealed Elanga was set to go on loan before a substitute appearance in December’s 1-0 win over Crystal Palace - the German’s first in charge – convinced the 63-year-old to ask the Swedish forward to stay. “He was the player with the best training performance, he had already decided to leave on loan,” Rangnick said. “He came on against Palace, and after I told him I want him to stay. Right now he has just shown what is possible with the right mentality, right approach to go into games.” A delighted Elenga said: “I told you how calm and cool I am and whenever I am given an opportunity I want to repay the manager.”",Sport/Football,"Manchester United’s plan was in dustbin after seven minutes, admits Rangnick",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/23/manchester-uniteds-plan-was-in-dustbin-after-seven-minutes-admits-rangnick
2/24/2022,"Thousands of police matters could be in doubt after it was discovered more than 1,200 Victoria police officers and protective service officers have been working without the authority to do so for up to eight years. The state’s chief commissioner, Shane Patton, on Thursday revealed that an “administrative oversight” after the introduction of the Victoria Police Act meant 1,076 police officers, 157 protective service officers and 29 police custody officers had been incorrectly sworn in between July 2014 and August 2021.  “The reality is that number of police officers and PSOs have been performing that role without having the actual powers validly to do so over that period of time,” he said. “We intend to remediate it. “They have of course, been working with other police officers during that period of time who had those extra powers that police are granted and they also have those standing powers as any citizen has to conduct arrests.” In the past, deputy commissioners were able to appoint acting assistant commissioners, who went on to swear in graduating police officers. But under changes made to the Victoria Police Act 2013, which came into effect in mid-2014, acting assistant commissioners needed to be appointed by the chief commissioner or by a deputy commissioner to whom the chief commissioner had delegated authority. “So what that means is that on a number of occasions since 2014 acting assistant commissioners on occasions have sworn in police officers and protective services officers without having the valid powers to do so,” Patton said. He said about 660 officers would be sworn on Thursday, with the remainder to follow in the coming days. Victoria’s police minister, Lisa Neville, said she had been aware of the issue on Tuesday. Legislation would urgently be introduced to state parliament next sitting week to ensure all decisions that have been made by the officers hadvalidity going forward, she said. “It’s really important that we act quickly,” Neville said. “I know that the opposition are being briefed as we speak. “I’m very confident that they will also want to provide comfort to these police officers and ensure criminals don’t get away with crimes because of an administrative problem that we’ve had over the last eight years.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She said it was her hope the legislation passed both houses of parliament during the sitting week to “minimise the impact that this will have on any cases”. “The advice that I have is that if we do this … and it’s done retrospectively, it won’t undermine any criminal or other actions undertaken by these police officers,” she said. Patton said it was his expectation there would be no ongoing ramifications for police officers involved. “They’ve been acting in good faith, they’ve been performing their duties in the belief that they had the requisite powers and as a result of that we will continue to indemnify those officers,” he said.",News/Australia news,"Administrative bungle means 1,200 Victoria police have been working without proper authority",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/administrative-bungle-means-1200-victoria-police-have-been-working-without-proper-authority
2/24/2022,"Live-in domestic workers in Hong Kong have been left homeless after they were diagnosed with Covid-19 and their employers fired them or refused their return to the residence, support groups have said. Many of the workers, who are mostly women from Indonesia and the Philippines, were also left without insurance to cover their medical bills.  Hong Kong is in the midst of its worst ever outbreak with the Omicron variant infecting thousands of people a day, overwhelming hospitals and government isolation facilities. The problem is exacerbated by strict policies of mandatory isolation for patients and close contacts, with tens of thousands of people unable to find accommodation. They have instead been told to isolate at home, but in the cases of dozen of domestic workers, their employers have refused to let them. There are an estimated 390,000 domestic workers in Hong Kong, working six days a week, for a minimum HK$4630 (US$593) a month plus food and board. They are legally required to live with their employers and isolating anywhere else, other than government facilities or hospital, is illegal. Maria*, a domestic worker from the Philippines, tested positive on a rapid antigen test. She said her employer gave her three options – pay for her own stay in a quarantine hotel for two weeks, go to hospital and “tell them I am very sick”, or have her contract terminated. “I went to hospital in the morning but there were so many patients I finished at 6 o’clock in the evening,” she said. “My employer told me I can’t come back to their house, because I was dangerous and I was afraid that I would transfer the virus.” Stranded at midnight, Maria’s friends reached out to an NGO, HELP For Domestic Workers, who found her a place in a shelter. Other workers have been forced to sleep in parks, at overpasses, or outside hospitals. HELP said they were assisting more than 100 workers left homeless, including at least a dozen who were fired or ordered not to return to the home. On Tuesday the Philippines consul to the city accused the Hong Kong residents who were firing and evicting their workers of illegal and “immoral” acts. “If it can be proven that they were asked to leave because of their sickness, this can be considered an illegal dismissal under the employment ordinance in Hong Kong,” said Raly Tejada, adding the mission was helping more than 60 people. “We are proactively engaging also the employers to explain to them that terminating their employees in these difficult times especially when they are positive is not only illegal. It is immoral.” Manisha Wijesinghe, the executive director of HELP, said many employers were scared they and their families could get sick or be sent to quarantine facilities as close contacts of the ill worker. “I don’t think there is a malicious intent there. It’s really the fear that’s driving everybody at the moment,” she said. But leaving the women homeless, some for up to three or four nights in Hong Kong’s winter, was “untenable”. Wijesinghe called on Hong Kong residents to provide support for their domestic workers who fell ill. “We understand that it is a scary time and everyone is worried for their own safety, for their children and family’s safety, but the thing is the domestic worker is also part of the family. They are the ones that take care of you on a day to day basis,” she said. According to HELP and other NGOs most cases of stranded workers are people who had tested positive before a flight home and were denied boarding. Mai* said she slept in a tent after she tested positive before her flight to the Philippines, and was refused reentry to the boarding house where she’d been staying. “They gave me a tent and a thick blanket so I wouldn’t feel cold. I slept the whole night outside the boarding house,” she said. Mai has since moved to a shelter, but the NGOs say the facilities, which usually house people in between jobs or waiting for flights home, are ill equipped to also isolate Covid patients. The government has said it is coordinating with consulates to provide assistance to workers who lost jobs, and looking for alternative accommodation sites. Maria said she hopes to return to her job because she has three children to support, but will look for new employers. “I don’t know if I get sick again if it will happen again. If they do this again to me, I think I shouldn’t go back to them,” she said",News/World news,Hong Kong domestic workers left homeless after being fired for contracting Covid-19,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/hong-kong-domestic-workers-left-homeless-after-being-fired-for-contracting-covid-19
2/24/2022,"South-east Queensland is bracing for another day of heavy rainfall as a slow-moving storm system threatens to bring 300 millimetres of rain in just six hours. It comes amid the search for a missing motorbike rider, feared to have been swept away in the flood at Gympie on Wednesday.  Authorities have located the bike, backpack and helmet of the 54-year-old man, and are concerned he did not see the floodwaters. “It was a very large dump of water in a very small amount of time,” Queensland Police Inspector Patrick Swindells said. “There’s all likelihood that he didn’t see the flooding waters and has become disabled or washed away.” The intense weather is expected to worsen throughout Thursday and continue into Friday as it sweeps into northern NSW. The storms across NSW are expected to bring dangerous conditions with flash flooding and rivers overflowing, while the heavy rain felt over Sydney the last few days should ease. NSW northeast is likely to bear the brunt of the ongoing wet weather. “We are looking really closely up at the Northern Rivers and near the Queensland border where we are already seeing some thunderstorms and heavy rainfall accumulations,” the Bureau of Meteorology’s Gabrielle Woodhouse said on Wednesday, warning of potential flash flooding and rising river levels. “We’re going to see these rainfall totals really start to build up.” Slow-moving storms could translate into more heavy rainfall for residents along the southern NSW coastline and the northern inland region, she said. “It’s a dynamic situation. The main thing is it’s going to remain wet even though we will see the conditions ease off in the northeast on Friday,” Ms Woodhouse said, adding rainfall is likely to shift southwards over the weekend. A severe weather warning has been issued for the south-east cost of Queensland, with intense rains 300mm possibly falling within six hours in the area. Weatherzone, a weather monitoring service, reiterated the prediction of “wet and stormy weather” persisting “into Thursday, Friday and possibly Saturday” across northeast NSW and southeast Queensland, due to a trough passing over the region. It said downpours are likely to deliver between 200mm and 500mm of rain in the coming days in some areas. NSW is experiencing a wetter than usual summer in the midst of a La Nina weather pattern that is predicted to stretch into autumn.

2/24/2022,"A 7-square-metre microflat, cramming in a bed, toilet, shower, sink and a microwave tucked under the pillow, has sold for 80% above its minimum listing price at £90,000. The microflat, located in a Victorian conversion in Lower Clapton, east London, is believed to be the capital’s smallest-ever property, marking a turn towards tiny homes driven by the UK’s housing crisis of soaring rent and property prices.  The apartment had a minimum price at auction of £50,000, but sold at 80% higher at £90,000. After its listing it was described on social media as a “posh cell”. It was bought for £103,500 in May 2017. But the owner has already recouped their investment by receiving £800 a month in rent. The microproperty encapsulates the growing trend of tiny homes, experts told the Guardian this week, as soaring rent and property prices accelerate demand for microflats. Asking prices for homes joining the market in Britain climbed by a record 2.3% in February, according to the property website Rightmove, and the Office for National Statistics found the average cost of renting for UK tenants rose by 2% in 2021 – the largest annual jump in five years. The Clapton flat, which has a large window, has recently been renovated. To maximise space, it has a captain’s bed above storage space, cupboards and a microwave. The space between the bed and the wall is about wide enough to spread your arms in, and there’s a foldout table for eating or working on. A toilet and shower are in a separate wet room. The property’s current tenant lives elsewhere for most of the time and spends just a night or two each week in the flat, for work. The TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp recently caused anger by suggesting young people could afford to buy homes if they spent less on the gym, easyJet flights, coffee and Netflix. Critics replied that, when Allsopp bought her first flat, the average home cost £50,000 and measured 73.4 sq m – 10 times bigger than the Clapton flat. Stuart Collar-Brown, the director of My Auction, which is selling the flat, said that although it was the cheapest flat with a long leasehold on the market within a 10-mile radius, he expected it would be bought by an investor rather than a first-time buyer, as high street banks will not lend on properties below 30 sq m. With rental income estimated at about £10,000, investors were likely to be able to recoup the £50,000 outlay within five years, Collar-Brown said. Suitable tenants would not spend much time at home and would be those who were tired of house-sharing but unable to afford more space, or who lived elsewhere and needed a crash pad for work, he added. For instance, doctors or nurses working in nearby Homerton hospital, or workers in the City, given the area’s good transport links to Liverpool Street.

2/24/2022,"Ivanka Trump is in talks with the January 6 House select committee about potentially cooperating with the panel, according to multiple US media reports. “Ivanka Trump is in discussions with the Committee to voluntarily appear for an interview,” a spokesperson for the daughter of former President Donald Trump said in a statement on Wednesday, CNN reported.  According to the New York Times, which first reported the discussions, it remains unclear whether the preliminary negotiations would result in Trump actually providing substantial information to the committee. Earlier this month, the Guardian reported that the committee was considering issuing a subpoena to Trump to force her cooperation with the inquiry into the former president’s efforts to return himself to power on 6 January 2021. Any move to subpoena Trump and, for the first time, force a member of Donald Trump’s own family to testify against him, would mark a dramatic escalation in the January 6 inquiry that would amount to a treacherous legal and political moment for the former president. In January, the committee released a public letter addressed to Ivanka Trump in which committee members called upon her to provide “voluntary cooperation with our investigation”. “We write to request your voluntary cooperation with our investigation on a range of critical topics … We respect your privacy, and our questions will be limited to issues relating to January 6th, the activities that contributed to or influenced events on January 6th, and your role in the White House during that period,” the letter said. Sources familiar with the discussions told the New York Times that Trump had not yet agreed on a date for when she might speak with the committee and that the panel had not made any subpoena threats. Trump reportedly does not plan to follow in the steps of Steve Bannon, a staunch ally of her father who refused to cooperate with the panel and was later indicted for contempt of Congress. The sources added that Donald Trump had not requested his daughter refuse the committee’s requests. In the letter addressed to Ivanka Trump last month, the committee revealed new details about attempts to urge Donald Trump to condemn the violence on 6 January 2021. According to Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general and the former vice-president Mike Pence’s national security adviser, Ivanka Trump and White House officials urged the president twice to condemn the violence. Donald Trump allegedly said no to aides, including his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany. Kellogg then asked Ivanka Trump to speak to the president, saying: “She went back in, because Ivanka can be pretty tenacious.” In an interview with the Washington Examiner last month, the former president criticized the committee’s investigation into his children, saying, “It’s a very unfair situation for my children … Very, very unfair.”",News/US news,"Ivanka Trump in talks to cooperate with January 6 panel, reports say",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/23/ivanka-trump-capitol-attack-committee-january-6
