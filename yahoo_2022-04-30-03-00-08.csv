4/30/2022,"A former F-35 test pilot weighed in on the fighter jet’s performance in the Ukraine conflict and how it represents a massive leap forward from Cold War-era aircraft. Billie Flynn contends the F-35 is so different from Soviet Cold War fighters that pilots used to the latter would be unable to transition to the F-35. Flynn also thinks the F-35 is the most survivable aircraft for the dangerous skies over Ukraine. One of the most noted authorities on the F-35 has some interesting things to say about the jet, including how it would fit in with European air forces, and how suitable the fighter is for the air war over Ukraine. Billie Flynn, a former Lockheed Martin test pilot, also talked about how the jet represents a massive leap forward from older, Soviet-designed fighter jets, noting that the pilots who train them would be unable to learn how to fly the F-35. Flynn also believes the F-35 is the only jet that can survive in the lethal air environment over Ukraine. Billie Flynn is one of the most accomplished test pilots around. Flynn originally flew CF-18 Hornets for the Royal Canadian Air Force, and later flew as a test pilot for the Eurofighter Typhoon. He later went on to fly for Lockheed Martin for 17 years, from 2003 to 2020, in support of the Joint Strike Fighter program. Flynn is a big fan of the F-35, and if there’s anyone who knows the jet inside and out, it’s him. In a wide-ranging interview with The Aviationist, Flynn touched upon a number of points about the F-35. One of the most interesting is his assertion that pilots in Eastern European countries that still fly Soviet-era fighters are just going to be unable to fly a fifth-generation jet like the F-35. Three NATO countries—Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Poland—still fly the Soviet MiG-29 fighter jet, classified by NATO in the 1980s as the “Fulcrum.” The MiG-29, designed in the late 1970s, is the equivalent of the American F-16 Fighting Falcon. The collapse of the Warsaw Pact in 1989 and the absorption of most countries into NATO means that some countries fly both MiG-29s and F-16s. And, as it continues to modernize, Poland will soon be in the unique position of flying MiG-29s, F-16s, and F-35s. Does this mean a Polish pilot could fly all three? Not so fast, says Flynn. He contends that pilots that have flown Soviet-era fighters for the bulk of their careers would simply be unable to effectively fly the F-35. The MiG-29 is a completely different aircraft built with different design philosophies in mind. The MiG also lacks the technological sophistication of the F-35, from the stealthy design to the distributed aperture system that allows the pilot to “see” through the side of his aircraft. A pilot unused to such advances, flying on muscle memory and learned instinct, might not properly take advantage of everything the F-35 has to offer. Flynn believes that Poland’s air force, which could soon fly all three jets, would likely push F-16 pilots into the F-35, leaving MiG pilots to close out their careers on the aging jets. Flynn also believes that the F-35 would dominate in the air war over Ukraine, because it is exactly the environment the jet was built to excel in. The war has already claimed more than three dozen fighters and attack jets from both sides. Ukrainian Air Force jets, for example, not only have to deal with Su-30M Flanker and Su-35 Flanker-E twin engine, multi-role fighters, but S-400 long-range air defense systems and short-range battlefield air defense systems. Russian fighters must contend with Ukrainian fighters, Ukraine’s original air defense network, and now an increasing number of surface-to-air missile systems donated by NATO. The F-35 is only the second fighter jet in history developed with stealth technology from the ground up, and specifically with the S-400 missile system in mind. Furthermore, Flynn believes the jet’s network of sensors, and ability to share data with other aircraft and ground assets, would make it an efficient air-defense killer, identifying S-400s and similar platforms and then killing them with ruthless efficiency. Flynn asserts that while nobody wants NATO dragged into the war, if it was, it would “completely destroy the Russian forces.” You Might Also Like This Device Can Send Messages Without Cell Service The Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere The Best Video Game the Year You Were Born",Business/Popular Mechanics,F-35 Pilot: NATO Could ‘Completely Destroy the Russian Forces’,https://news.yahoo.com/f-35-pilot-nato-could-172200905.html
4/30/2022,"Trump mocked the idea of changing the date of his Tulsa campaign rally on June 19, 2020. ""Have you ever heard of such a ridiculous thing?"" Trump said privately, according to a new book. The conversation was reported by New York Times journalists Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin. President Donald Trump privately mocked the idea of changing the date of his 2020 Tulsa campaign rally because it fell on Juneteenth, according to a forthcoming book by New York Times reporters Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin that Insider obtained an advance copy of. Eager to return to the campaign trail after months-long COVID-19 lockdowns, Trump was discussing his upcoming June 19 rally with his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who were White House senior advisors at the time. They were at Trump's New Jersey Bedminster golf club with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and his wife, Tammy, a week before the rally. ""'Can you imagine,' Trump asked the Murphys, 'changing the day of the rally in Oklahoma to accommodate these people? Have you ever heard of such a ridiculous thing?'"" Burns and Martin wrote in their book ""This Will Not Pass,"" which comes out Tuesday. It had been less than a month since the police killing of George Floyd, and protests against police brutality and systemic racism had been taking place nationwide. Trump, already under criticism over his response to the racial justice protests, had sparked controversy when he announced his major campaign event would take place in Tulsa, the site of one of the worst massacres of African Americans in US history, and on Juneteenth, an annual celebration in the Black community that commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. The anecdote was a ""display of raw disdain for a population of Americans already in great pain after George Floyd's murder, and another sign that Donald Trump simply did not see himself as a president for everyone,"" the reporters wrote. Trump's office did not immediately return Insider's request for comment. Trump eventually did change the date of the rally amid public pressure, though his public comments at the time contrasted with his private conversation with the Murphys and his family members. The rally was rescheduled, he wrote on Twitter, ""out of respect"" for Juneteenth. ""We had previously scheduled our #MAGA Rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for June 19th – a big deal. Unfortunately, however, this would fall on the Juneteenth Holiday,"" Trump wrote in a tweet at the time. ""Many of my African American friends and supporters have reached out to suggest that we consider changing the date out of respect for this Holiday,"" he continued, adding that he moved the rally to June 20 ""to honor their requests."" Trump later said in a Wall Street Journal interview that a Black Secret Service agent explained to him what Juneteenth was, and African American leaders told him that it was insensitive to host the rally on that day. The president then took credit for popularizing the holiday, and claimed it was not well known. ""I did something good: I made Juneteenth very famous,"" Trump told The Journal, referencing the news coverage around his rally date. ""It's actually an important event, an important time. But nobody had ever heard of it."" President Joe Biden made Juneteenth a federal holiday last year.

4/30/2022,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York judge on Friday denied a request from Donald Trump's lawyer to end a contempt-of-court finding against the former U.S. president and kept in place $10,000-a-day fine over his failure to comply with a subpoena issued by the state attorney general investigating the business practices of Trump's family company, the Trump Organization. Justice Arthur Engoron in New York state court in Manhattan said he was not satisfied with an affidavit provided by Trump and said there was no evidence Trump had conducted a thorough search for the records sought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. ""I am surprised he doesn't seem to have any documents, they're all with the organization,"" the judge said. ""I will consider your request to terminate the fine,"" he told Trump lawyer Alina Habba. ""But if you don't hear from me, the clock is still ticking."" James says her probe has turned up evidence the Trump Organization, which manages hotels, golf courses and other real estate around the world, has given banks and tax authorities misleading financing information in order to obtain financial benefits such as favorable loans and tax breaks. Trump, a Republican, has denied wrongdoing and calls the probe politically motivated. James is a Democrat.
