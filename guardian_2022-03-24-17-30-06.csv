3/24/2022,"Behold. For he is risen. Gareth Bale is feeling better. Pictures of Bale training happily in Cardiff this week confirmed there are no lingering effects from the back pain (or “not feeling right”, according to Carlo Ancelotti) which had kept Bale out of Real Madrid’s 4-0 shellacking at home against Barcelona on Sunday night. And as miracles of healing go, this is a timely one, after an absence which just happened, by pure coincidence, to fall four days before the biggest (and surely last) opportunity Bale is going to get to lead Wales to a World Cup. Let’s face it, he was never going to miss this one. Nobody could ever accuse Uefa of dumbing down or oversimplifying its qualifying pathway. But at the end of that labyrinthine process Wales have been presented with what is, on the face of it, a highly favourable route to Qatar. Robert Page’s team are well capable of winning Thursday’s home semi-final against Austria, who got here by finishing as the sixth‑highest ranked Nations League group winner, came fourth in qualification Group F, and are ranked 10 places lower than Wales by Fifa. The same goes for a final home eliminator against Scotland or Ukraine whenever world events permit – Uefa’s June scheduling already looks optimistic. If this still feels like a complex chain of events with the World Cup itself only eight months away, there is at least a streamlined quality to the chat around the latest chapter in Welsh football’s grail quest of the past 64 years. We will, of course, be talking about Bale and Aaron Ramsey. Let’s do this one more time. Because it is always a little later than you think. There are good reasons for focusing on those star names. Bale and Ramsey remain hugely potent figures. Together they have 56 international goals; no one else in the current squad has got past five. This has been such a clearly defined era, during which these two outstanding talents have been the armature of the Welsh national team, where in other environments star players might end up as decoration. There is a sense here of something being played out to its final course. Much has been made of the likely atmosphere at the Cardiff City Stadium with some hopeful talk that the shared energy of a 30,000 crowd might be enough to disorientate opponents who have also missed out on the past five World Cups. There are two issues with this. First, Austria have their own big-game players. Never mind David Alaba or Marcel Sabitzer, Marko Arnautovic remains a brilliantly talented footballer whose greatest weakness seems to be his capacity to fall asleep for long periods of his own career. Prodding him with a stick might not actually be the most productive tactic. Mainly, though, successive qualifying campaigns in the Bale‑Ramsey era have been curtailed by very similar occasions, home defeat by a beatable opponent – with the caveat that on none of the three previous occasions have Wales managed to get both men out on the field at the same time with the scores still level. In October 2017 Wales lost 1-0 against the Republic of Ireland, also at the Cardiff City Stadium, to kill off lingering hopes of a trip to the modern, open, globalist Russia of Vladimir Putin. Wales had Ramsey but not Bale on a night when the Euro semi-finalists continued to struggle with the idea of not being underdogs. Four years earlier it was a defeat at the Liberty Stadium by Croatia that killed any dreams of Brazil 2014, as Wales fielded Bale but no Ramsey, who was suspended. Four years before that, a 2-0 defeat by Finland at the Millennium Stadium did at least see both men on field at the same time, with Ramsey a second-half sub, although Bale was still shackled to a defensive left‑back role. Would it help to add that four years before that, hopes were also stilled by a home defeat – this one against their opponents on Thursday, Austria? Probably not. Although a year later Bale became the youngest capped Welsh footballer, Ramsey joining him in the squad a year after. And from there it has overall been a genuinely uplifting mini‑era, a feat of team building so organic that both men have been able to step back into this side whatever their state of fitness or the dramas of their club careers. This process will now be tested to the full. Ramsey has three starts and one goal in club football since August. Bale has played two hours for Madrid in the past six months, and seems to have reached what is, on his “book age”, a premature state of declining appetite. It is easy to forget two things at this late stage. First, both men started so young. Bale made his professional debut three months before the 2006 World Cup, a footballing era so distant that two members of England’s own golden squad in Germany have been heard in the past week reminiscing about just how fine, and how much more difficult, life was back then. The 32-year-old Bale has played through the passage from then to now, and has sustained 21 injuries in the past four years alone. For all the sense of an extended Ferris Bueller’s Day Off in the late stage of his Madrid career, it is easy to overlook just how good Imperial Bale was: as exhilarating as anything the Premier League has seen, up there in a divine trinity with Peak Henry and Peak Ronaldo. It has been a debilitating style too, based on explosive speed and running power, on inviting collisions. In spite of which Bale has played more than 600 professional games and scored more than 100 goals for Madrid alone. He has driven a relatively small football nation to a major semi‑final. Even in relative decline, he reeled off that flying top corner overhead in Kyiv, the greatest goal scored in a Champions League final. It has been one of the great careers. Not that anyone in Wales needs reminding. But there is also a cost now to configuring a team around these basking giants. The tactical blanket is always too small, all the more so with two creative players in reduced states of mobility. Wales have tried different systems under Page, and have looked solid and hungry in their past four games. Ramsey started in all four. Bale played just 45 minutes. Welsh football has always been an enigmatic thing. The extended World Cup absence makes little sense given the quality of footballers produced, although often this has translated into an overload of creative attacking players. At a time when the FAW Trust is launching an extended grassroots drive, menaced by a lack of facilities or a clear pathway, alarmed at seeing outstanding young talents hoovered up by clubs across the border, a place at the winter World Cup would be a significant parting gift for the current golden mini-era.",Sport/Football,Bale and Ramsey take on final World Cup mission of enthralling Wales era | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/24/gareth-bale-aaron-ramsey-world-cup-2022-wales
3/24/2022,"The NFL has had its wildest offseason in recent memory. The quarterback carousel has been spinning. Record contracts have been inked. And it feels like just yesterday that Aaron Rodgers was getting intimate with oils. Here are the winners of the offseason so far. A quick note: these are the teams that have improved their chances the most for next season. When you move on from Drew Lock and land Russell Wilson, you know you’ve had a good offseason. There are fair questions about the fit between Wilson and the Broncos’ new head coach, Nathaniel Hackett. It isn’t a seamless melding of minds. And you can point, too, to the possibility that Wilson’s game may not age well. He still relies on his mobility as much as any of the game’s upper-tier quarterbacks. What will a Wilson offense look like once his legs start to go? But that’s tomorrow’s problem! The AFC West is now a year-to-year gauntlet. If you’re bringing anything other than a top-eight quarterback to the proceedings, then there is no chance that you’re making the playoffs. The Broncos started the offseason with a bottom-three quarterback situation and catapulted themselves into that small cluster of teams who can conceivably claim to have one of the five best in the game (two others happen to be in the same division). And all for a quartet of draft picks and a trio of peripheral players Denver will soon forget about. Having a top-five quarterback on a rookie-scale contract is the sport’s top market inefficiency. The Chargers took full advantage of their situation early in the offseason, investing aggressively, both in terms of cash and draft capital, in an attempt to improve their obvious flaws. First up: A historically awful run defense. Brandon Staley, the team’s head coach, is a proponent of what is known as the ‘Light Box’ theory, which essentially involves his team vacating the box in order to invite the run – the idea being that the run-game is, in general, less efficient than the pass. It’s a philosophy that garners talk of genius when a coach is working with Aaron Donald and Sebastian Joseph-Day. Line-up with Jerry Tillery, Justin Jones, and the group Staley was working with last season? Gulp. The Chargers finished dead last in the NFL in EPA per play against the run, a measure of a unit’s down-to-down efficiency. Chargers general manager Tom Telesco wasted no time in trying to turn things around, trading for former NFL defensive player of the year Khalil Mack and reuniting his coach with Joseph-Day, one of the league’s most underrated nose tackles. A reinforced front with Mack alongside Joey Bosa gives Staley the bookends he needs to run his idiosyncratic early-down defense, and offers the Chargers a formidable one-two pass-rush punch on later downs. Things have shifted on the back end, too. One element to the Staley orthodoxy is how few coverages the coach likes to run within a single game. Staley’s grand plan is to have as dynamic a defense over the entire season as possible – bouncing from one thing to another on a week-to-week basis. But in each individual game, Staley and his defense lean all the way into their chosen style. It’s not unusual to see the Chargers run the same coverage concept on nine or 10 successive plays, typically a no-no in the NFL. Handing former Patriots cornerback JC Jackson a $16m-a-year deal is a bid by the Chargers to diversify their coverage packages. Staley likes to play zone; Jackson is a best as a man-to-man corner. The majority of NFL teams now run fancy coverages that pair both principles together. The Chargers were lacking that complexity last year, but by dropping in Jackson alongside safeties Nasir Adderley and Derwin James, Staley now has a malleable secondary that will allow him to get more adventurous in coverage. Over the span of a week, the Dolphins signed Terron Armstead, one of the league’s best left tackles (when healthy), and traded for Tyreek Hill, the league’s most impactful wide receiver. It’s hard to overstate the significance of the Hill trade. Few trades really have the potential to transform an organization. The Hill-to-Miami deal does. Hill is one of the few non-quarterbacks whose skill-set completely shifts the geometry of the field. His ability to outpace anyone on the defensive side of the ball forces opposing defensive coordinators to commit two pieces – at a minimum – to securing leverage on his position at all times, and to back up as far from the line of scrimmage as possible, for fear of being left in the dust. There will be no more excuses for Tua Tagovailoa moving forward. The Dolphins have secured a run-game guru at head coach, reinforced the offensive line, and added Hill to a receiving corps featuring Jaylen Waddle and Mike Gesicki. Good luck to anyone trying to slow that offense down. Like the Chargers, the Bengals had an obvious weakness and set to work remapping their weakest area: The offensive line. Cincy’s group gifted a historic amount of pressure on Joe Burrow last season, finishing with the league’s worst pressure rate and conceding 70 sacks, an NFL record. The Bengals focused less on chucking money at their problem and more on changing the profile of their offensive line altogether. Burrow’s bobbing, weaving, create-on-the-fly style pushed the Bengals into investing in a series of latch-and-shuffle linemen early in the quarterback’s career – men who would fight and scrap throughout a play as Burrow looked to move and create. No more. The Bengals moved to bring in Ted Karras, Alex Cappa, and La’el Collins. All three are maulers. All three play a more proactive style than the Bengals have opted for during the Burrow era. All three want to stun defenders early on, win with an initial jolt, and then hope for the best. The Bengals’ plan is clear: Win early in the rep, and then if Joe needs to make a play, he’ll figure it out. It’s a smart change, and they’re probably not done. The Bengals are likely to explore the trade market or look to add another lineman early in the draft. Protecting Burrow is all that matters, and the typically slow-moving (read: cheap) Bengals have shown a commitment to protecting their franchise quarterback for the long term. Buffalo were 12 seconds of chaos away from beating the Chiefs in the playoffs last season. If they had advanced, they would probably have beaten the Bengals in the AFC title game – from there, who knows? They have added strength on strength this offseason, signing Von Miller to a six-year mega-deal that effectively functions as a three-year, please-push-us-over-the-top plea for help. The Bills didn’t desperately need extra pass-rushing juice, but adding a future Hall of Famer who totaled 80-odd pressures last year (his best return since 2017) and delivered defining plays throughout the Rams’ run to the Super Bowl is the kind of move that shifts a team from being great into an out-and-out juggernaut. Don’t overlook the addition of Rodger Saffold to the offensive line, either. The Titans released Saffold due to a decline in play, his advancing age, and some injury concerns. But if he’s healthy and good to go he will bring a tenacity to the Bills’ run game that has been sorely lacking over the last couple of seasons. Think about this: The Colts entered the offseason with Carson Wentz, a bad quarterback They leave the offseason with Matt Ryan, a good quarterback, one who comfortably outperformed the surrounding tire-fire in Atlanta last season. They did so without adding any extra money to their cap, with Atlanta absorbing a $40m (!) dead cap hit. Ryan’s cap hold is lower in Indy than Wentz’s would have been. They did it all for the cost of a third-round pick … and they brought in two third-round picks by dealing Wentz to Washington. Chris Ballard has made some funky decisions over the past 12 months. But his handling of the offseason quarterback shuffle should earn him executive of the year nods already. The Colts roster is far from complete. But unlike other sides staring down the AFC’s quarterback standoff, the Colts need only worry about contending in their own division: win 10 games, pip the Titans to the division title, and they will make the playoffs. With Ryan offering competent quarterback play and a defense laden with talent, 10 wins should be the floor. Ryan will be the Colts’ fifth starting quarterback in five years. And it’s likely that within two years he will hit the wall and Indianapolis will once again be in the market for a quarterback. But Ryan is an undoubted upgrade over Wentz, and adding him offers more wiggle room with the cap to add other impactful pieces. An offseason doesn’t get much better than that.",Sport/Sport,"Chargers, Dolphins or Colts?

3/24/2022,"“Lads, count down, …10/9/8/7/6/5/4/3/2/1 2022 World Cup Final Ignition,” tweeted Carlos Queiroz on Monday. “It took us a long and hard road to reach this deserved opportunity. We know certainly the challenge we face here. There is no room for sorrys or tomorrows.” The Egypt coach who twice served as an assistant to Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United may not have won many friends with his defensive tactics in the Pharaohs’ run to February’s Africa Cup of Nations final. But 47 days after Egypt’s shootout defeat by Aliou Cissé’s Senegal in Yaoundé, the sides will come face-to-face again in Cairo on Friday for the first leg of a World Cup play-off. For Queiroz it is a revenge mission he has clearly been relishing. “With courage, team-intelligent work and pride we can fly and nothing is impossible,” he wrote in his next tweet. “Once we have to do it, let’s do it with style and bravery, and make the ‘nothings’ possible.” Fears for Queiroz that his team may have to navigate a way past the new African champions without Mohamed Salah, after the forward limped off during Liverpool’s win over Brighton last week, have dissipated despite Salah missing Sunday’s FA Cup tie against Nottingham Forest. Sadio Mané was also rested by Jürgen Klopp, leading to speculation that the Liverpool manager was trying not to hand either country an advantage in a tie he could probably have done without amid a quadruple-chasing campaign. A distraught Salah had to be consoled by Mané in Yaoundé after watching on as his clubmate, who had missed a penalty in normal time, held his nerve to win the Afcon final shootout. Salah had been due to take Egypt’s fifth spot-kick. Mané insisted last month that the pair “don’t even talk about” events in the Cameroonian capital or the upcoming qualifier, although he admitted they had discussed the comical scenes before his missed penalty in the final, when Salah appeared to be instructing the goalkeeper Mohamed Abou Gabal over which way to dive before Mané joined their conversation. “Until now – you won’t believe me – but we haven’t talked about it, because I know he’s still disappointed for sure,” said Mané, who needs one goal to set a record for the Teranga Lions. “We have mentioned when I missed the penalty. He said: ‘Why did you come to see the goalkeeper?’ And I said: ‘Because you’ve been talking to him and I’m sure you will play mind games, so I will play mind games as well.’ “I saw him talking and I’m sure he was not saying anything much so it was fine to just say it was mind games and I want to be more fun than them, so I go: ‘Mo, I will put it in the right side; tell him I will put it in the right side.’ We were talking about this and laughing about it – it was quite funny.” Both sides failed to make it through the group stages at the last World Cup, with Salah not fully recovered from the shoulder injury sustained after clashing with Real Madrid’s Sergio Ramos in the 2018 Champions League final. That was Egypt’s first appearance since 1990. Mané and Senegal were unlucky to miss out on a place in the last 16 because of an inferior disciplinary record in what was Africa’s worst showing at a finals since 1982. Only one of the two Liverpool superstars can make it to Qatar, however, and Saer Seck, a former vice-president of the Senegalese FA and president of the renowned Diambars FC academy, is hoping Cissé’s men can make it a double celebration. “It will be a very important match,” he tells the Guardian. “The Afcon trophy is for the pride of the people because we had never won it before. But qualifying for the World Cup is also about economics – it will give our FA the capacity to develop younger age groups in the country, so we can continue to build. And it would not make sense if we didn’t make it to the World Cup after winning the Afcon ...” Diambars, founded by Seck in 2003 with help from the now Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira, helped to produce several members of the current Senegal squad, including Paris Saint-Germain’s Idrissa Gueye. The country reached the quarter-finals of the Under-20 World Cup in 2019, and there are high hopes that this generation can build on their Afcon success at the biggest tournament of all. “Senegal is a place where all the European clubs have been coming for many years now and this has made our links to Europe very strong,” Seck says. “When you have players like [Édouard] Mendy, [Kalidou] Koulibaly and Mané, there is no reason to be afraid of anything.” As for Vieira, Seck says the former France midfielder will be closely following events in Cairo and Tuesday’s return in Dakar. “Patrick always has an eye on Senegal because he was born here and part of his heart is here. He is very involved with Diambars – I speak to him probably once a month and try to give him some news. But now he is really engaged with Crystal Palace so he doesn’t have so much time.”",Sport/Football,Salah and Mané fight for World Cup ticket in Egypt v Senegal rematch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/24/salah-and-mane-world-cup-play-off-egypt-v-senegal-rematch
3/24/2022,"Spare a moment for the real victim of the mass sacking of P&O workers: Natalie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover. When she turned up to address a local protest in support of the now redundant staff, the attendees were, for some reason, unimpressed with her failure to vote against fire-and-rehire rules that had left those workers vulnerable to gangster capitalists such as the owners of P&O Ferries. After they chanted, “Shame on you” she warned fellow MPs of the dangers of “militant unionism”, and said she had been “bullied” and “abused”. But increasing numbers of Britons have come to realise that the real menace is not militant unionism, but militant capitalism. And that rather than being too extreme, the modern labour movement has been too subdued. Trade union membership is around half of its 1979 peak: just a quarter of the British workforce are members of unions, and in the private sector, it’s a derisory 13%. As Tony Blair boasted in 1997, British law was “the most restrictive on trade unions in the western world”, and Tory anti-union laws have only tightened that vice since. Communities based around secure jobs in mining, factories and docks have given way to a precarious and transient workforce that is harder to organise. And there’s an even bigger existential menace to trade unions: decades of officially sanctioned hostility to trade unionism has left the very concept alien to many younger people. ​​As one study of young core workers by the Trades Union Congress in the UK found: “The vast majority hadn’t heard the words ‘trade union’ and couldn’t provide a definition.” But a new generation of trade unionists believe these are challenges to overcome, not excuses for passivity. “The anti-union laws in the UK are draconian and terrible,” Eve Livingston, the author of Make Bosses Pay: Why We Need Unions, told me. “But that said, there are still powerful tools and strategies available to unions if they’re brave enough to make use of them.” Livingston’s critique goes like this: some unions shifted from an organising model to a servicing model – that is, focusing on signing members up to union magazines, offering discounts and insurance policies, rather than going to the workplace to discuss activism and politics. One striking example of an organising model is that of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWBG), whose Ecuador-born general secretary Henry Chango Lopez can often be seen on picket lines bellowing through a megaphone as the union’s red-white-and-green flags flutter behind him. When he became a porter at the University of London in 2010, “I just didn’t know about any rights we had,” he tells me. Like other outsourced workers – from cleaners to security – he lacked basic rights but felt abandoned by traditional unions. “We weren’t being supported, they wouldn’t put any resources into supporting us,” he tells me. But the IWGB’s tactics of wildcat strikes, direct action and building coalitions with other grassroots organisations, trade unions and students paid off. In 2020, the University of London was forced to recognise the workers – from porters to receptionists to cleaners – as staff, with all the rights that entailed. IWGB is a small union, but it punches hard: it has won employment rights for workers ranging from couriers to foster care workers. “I think if we’re able to do all of this without resources – we function on a shoestring – why can’t unions with loads of money in their bank accounts,” asks Lopez. “They can organise workers, invest in training, get organisers to go into workplaces.” Those younger, precarious workers who are supposedly out of reach of unions are being organised by IWGB: for actions such as the ongoing longest ever courier strike, as McDonald’s, Greggs and Costa delivery drivers take action over pay and conditions. There are some other unions that do this, and have found themselves vilified for their success: such as the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), which represents the P&O workers and, more famously, train and tube drivers, whose decent salaries should be seen as the product of dogged organising. But the most decisive shift towards the organising model is the recent election of Sharon Graham as general secretary of Unite, the biggest private sector union, who pithily sums up her pitch to me: “We need to get back to the workplace and get off the hamster wheel of party politics.” Believing Unite has invested too much energy and resources into remoulding the Labour party rather than “hard miles dedicated to organising and mobilising workers”, Graham believes younger workers need to be won over by focusing energy on unionising the service sector. Given Unite’s size, this resolute approach poses the biggest potential threat yet to the Thatcherite anti-union settlement. There are several factors feeding into a possible union resurgence. Stagnating living standards were often masked by access to cheap easy credit, but that has injected destabilising levels of household debt into the economy. In-work benefits, too, have been repeatedly slashed in real terms. Horror stories – from Sports Direct’s reliance on zero-hours contracts to the lack of rights for Uber drivers to the latest P&O travesty – have helped cement a justified public attitude that British workers have an unfair lot. Yes, unions are shackled by restrictive laws, they’re demonised by politicians and media outlets, and they face formidable obstacles in organising an increasingly fragmented workforce. But unions are the only viable challengers to the P&Os of this world – and that fact is surely becoming ever more obvious.

3/24/2022,"The lack of financial support for low-income families in Rishi Sunak’s mini-budget will see 1.3 million people – including half a million children – pushed below the poverty line next year, according to the Resolution Foundation. The chancellor’s spring statement on Wednesday offered some tax cuts, such as 5p-a-litre off fuel duty and a £3,000 increase in the threshold for national insurance contributions, but came in for widespread criticism for failing to support poorer families and other vulnerable groups from the soaring cost of living. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said just one-in-eight workers would see their tax bills fall by the end of this parliament in May 2024, when the rate of income tax will drop by 1p to 19p. “In the face of a cost of living crisis that looks set to make this parliament the worst on record for household incomes, the chancellor came to the box yesterday promising support with the cost of living today, and tax cuts tomorrow,” said Torsten Bell, the thinktank’s chief executive. “The decision not to target support at those hardest hit by rising prices will leave low- and-middle income households painfully exposed.” The Resolution Foundation said it is the first time that there will be such a large increase in the number of people being pushed into poverty outside of a recession. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said on Wednesday that inflation will hit a 40-year high of 8.7% in October, fuelling the biggest fall in living standards in any single year since records began in 1956. The foundation’s analysis of Sunak’s spring statement estimates that a typical family is due to see a £1,100 fall in income this year, around 4%, with the poorest households facing a 6% fall. It also found that only those earning between £49,100 and £50,300 will pay less income tax in 2024-25, and only those earning between £11,000 and £13,500 will pay less tax and national insurance. Of the 31 million people in work, 27 million will pay more in tax and national insurance in 2024-25. “The big picture is that Rishi Sunak has prioritised rebuilding his tax-cutting credentials over supporting the low- to middle-income households who will be hardest hit from the surging cost of living, while also leaving himself flexibility in the years ahead,” Bell said. “Whether this will be sustainable in the face of huge income falls remains to be seen.”",News/Politics,Lack of help from Rishi Sunak for struggling UK families will push 1.3m into poverty,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/24/lack-of-help-from-rishi-sunak-for-struggling-uk-families-will-push-13m-into-poverty
3/24/2022,"A defiant Gareth Ward has vowed to continue representing the people of Kiama after his suspension from parliament, as the New South Wales government seeks advice on cutting the embattled former minister’s salary and benefits. The Kiama MP was suspended from parliament on Thursday, until the charges against him are resolved. Ward was charged by police earlier this week over the alleged sexual abuse of a 17-year-old boy and a man. Ward, who moved to the crossbench last year after revealing he was the subject of a criminal investigation, has denied the allegations and indicated he will be fighting the charges. On Thursday, acting premier Paul Toole told the parliament that the government would not move to expel the former Liberal minister to safeguard the pending criminal trial. The motion to suspend was supported by the opposition. Ward, who has not been in parliament this week, released a statement using his electorate email after the suspension. He said he was “extremely disappointed”, vowing to continue representing the people of his electorate. “The effect of the decision is that I am unable to speak and vote in parliament,” he said. “I will, however, continue to represent and lobby for my local community as its democratically elected member of parliament. As challenging a time as this is for me personally, I have an important job to do and I intend to get on with it.” The government has sought legal advice of whether another MP or a parliamentary secretary could represent Ward’s electorate in the interim to ensure voters weren’t denied services. Toole said that the move to suspend Ward was the “strongest action” available to the government given the house was unable to rule on his guilt or innocence – noting it was a job for the courts. He said the government was not moving to suspend the member’s pay because it did not have that power, but was looking at other options. Toole reminded all members of the house that they should not discuss the charges or allegations against Ward to avoid a mistrial. “The most significant of these risks is the possibility that alleged victims will be deprived of their day in court,” Toole told parliament. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The opposition leader, Chris Minns, has confirmed Labor is seeking advice over alternative options, including whether the member could be expelled, the suspension of Ward’s salary and if it is appropriate for him to be stripped of access to his electorate office through a referral to the privileges committee. NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said on Tuesday when charges were first laid that, while Ward was entitled to the presumption of innocence, he should fight the charges as a private citizen and he would seek to remove the member from parliament if he did not resign.

3/24/2022,"The Liberals have selected Simon Kennedy, a partner at consulting firm McKinsey, for the seat of Bennelong on Sydney’s north shore, in a branch plebiscite which again saw the right-aligned candidate trump the moderates’ preferred person. Kennedy, who is a relative newcomer to the party, won the ballot against Gisele Kapterian, a former ministerial staffer, 148 votes to 95. He replaces the former tennis star, John Alexander, who is retiring. For the moderates, this was a second unexpected defeat in a preselection conducted under the new Warringah rules, designed to give branch members a bigger say. It raises questions about whether the membership of the Liberal party is more conservative than the party’s NSW leadership. As one of the founding members of the public sector consulting division at McKinsey, Kennedy has worked closely with Charlie Taylor, who is the party’s federal treasurer and brother of the energy minister, Angus Taylor, who was also at McKinsey prior to entering politics. According to those present at Kennedy’s presentation to selectors, he had claimed credit for designing the $89bn jobkeeper program while at McKinsey. Kennedy said McKinsey had held workshops for cabinet ministers over the design of the scheme. The scheme is credited with having prevented wide-scale job losses but after the economy recovered more quickly than expected, it has been criticised for not allowing Treasury to claw back funds if businesses had overestimated the downturn in their revenues. The NSW Senate ticket is due to be decided on Saturday, with the foreign minister, Marise Payne, expected to be endorsed for the first spot and a fierce contest expected between three candidates for the third spot. (The second spot on the ticket is reserved for the Nationals.) Senator Jim Molan appears to have the edge over Senator Concetta Fierravante -Wells and the NSW Liberal women’s council president, Mary-Lou Jarvis. About 700 members of state council are eligible to vote. On Sunday the federal executive of the party is meeting and there is still concern in the party that it may stage an intervention in the troubled NSW branch. The federal executive had set a deadline of 25 March for the NSW division to resolve its long-running preselection impasse. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Two of the most contentious preselections for two winnable seats – Parramatta and Hughes – are due to be held next week with plebiscites planned. In Parramatta, Charles Camenzuli is the frontrunner, but the likely outcome in Hughes is unclear, with three nominees including state MP Melanie Gibbons. It is still possible that the federal party could intervene in these and other seats. There are two longer shot seats that have not been decided – Warringah and Greenway. It is possible the federal party will step in to appoint candidates with the federal election looming in May. Matthew Camenzuli, a member of the state executive and cousin of Charles Camenzuli, has sought an urgent hearing of his case in the NSW supreme court against the federal executive for an earlier intervention which saw the federal party confirm the preselections of two ministers and a sitting MP. Camenzuli is challenging the action as beyond power and arguing the ministers and MP should also face branch votes. The case is due in court on 31 March.

3/24/2022,"Matthew Green first heard about Dunwich, the drowned medieval city off the Suffolk coast, in 2016 during a period of instability and “emotional turmoil” in his life, when his father died and his wife left him. “I was determined to discover how our country has come to be shaped by absences,” writes Green, “just as my life had come to be defined by what was no longer there.” Dunwich, once a major port of 5,000 people and the capital city of Saxon East Anglia, fell victim to coastal erosion. Of its seven parish churches, All Saints was the last to succumb. Its tower collapsed into the sea, together with the cliff on which it was built, in 1922, “amid a waterfall of dead men’s bones on to the beach below”. But as Green says, and his book splendidly demonstrates, “what has disappeared beneath sea can rebuild itself in the mind”. Since the 13th century, when the Suffolk coastline by Dunwich began to be seriously gnawed by the waves, thousands of settlements have disappeared from our maps. It is the untold story of these lost communities – “Britain’s shadow topography” – that has become Green’s obsession. He disinters their rich history and reimagines the lives of those who walked their streets, revealing “tales of human perseverance, obsession, resistance and reconciliation”. By doing so, he makes tangible the tragedy of their loss and the threat we all face from the climate crisis on these storm-tossed islands. More than 4,000 villages in Britain are at risk of catastrophic flooding in the next two decades: “Britain has some of the fastest disappearing cliffs in Europe.” Parts of London could be underwater by the end of this century. By then large areas of Britain might be “more shadow than land”. Green, a historian and author specialising in the history of the capital, takes his reader on a tour of eight communities that fell victim to forces of nature, changes in economic circumstances or deliberate destruction, as in Capel Celyn, Wales – drowned beneath a reservoir – and Stanford, Norfolk – requisitioned by the military as a training area. He begins at windswept Skara Brae, Orkney, a 5,000-year-old settlement that emerged from beneath the sand after a terrible storm in 1850. This neolithic Pompeii is “one of the oldest built structures anywhere on the planet”, more ancient than Stonehenge or the pyramids of Egypt. It has provided archaeologists with a key to unlocking the mysteries of how our ancestors lived at the dawn of civilisation. The first houses were built around 3200BC, when the village was a mile from the sea; now it is on the shoreline. The idea of successive generations living in the same homes, cheek-by-jowl with their neighbours, was “positively revolutionary” in these islands. Occupied for many centuries by about a hundred people, Skara Brae was “a tiny beehive of activity bored into the earth, a commune”. Mystery surrounds why its people left. Perhaps an apocalyptic storm in 2500BC buried the settlement in a tsunami of sand. They could have succumbed to pillaging invaders or disease. Or, as the climate became colder and wetter and the sea began encroaching on the land, perhaps people moved to greener pastures. No one knows. Green’s journey leads him onwards to the site of the lost medieval settlement of Trellech in Monmouthshire. In 2005, an amateur archaeologist, Stuart Wilson (a “Welsh Indiana Jones”), gambled a small fortune buying a field beneath which he believed lay what had been the largest city in Wales. It has since become, Green says, “one of the longest-running and most democratic digs in British history”. Wilson believes Trellech was the same physical size as London in the 13th century. Professional archaeologists are not so sure, however, turning up their noses at someone they regard as a “roguish amateur bypassing the rigours of academia”. Green explores both sides of the argument, delving into the history of this important community and its meteoric rise as a centre for iron working, in particular the production of weapons for the English ruler of the region, Richard de Clare: “from the anvils of Trellech came swords to plunge into the hearts of enemies”. Wharram Percy in the Yorkshire Wolds is one of Europe’s most famous deserted villages. Established in around AD850 and occupied for about 600 years, all that remains of it now is a ruined church and a field of bumpy grass bounded by a ditch. Beneath the grass are the remains of at least 40 peasant homes. As Green walks around it, he feels “a compulsive desire to explore their domestic world, to be there as the people woke to bury a relative, sprang from a straw mattress on a saint’s bacchanal, or faced the monotony of tilling the fields”. The village persisted despite Scottish raids and the Black Death of 1348, which wiped out 40% of England’s population. But ultimately it succumbed to sheep. The inhabitants were evicted in the 15th century to allow the landowner to create enclosed pasture fields for grazing. Henry James visited Dunwich at the turn of the last century, soaking up the “desolate, exquisite” atmosphere, and observed with typical acuity that “there is a presence in what is missing, there is history in there being so little”. As Green’s book so eloquently shows, people are drawn to these places because they are poignant reminders of the transitory nature of our own much-loved homes and communities. He writes: “In the lost village, we see the gently falling sand of the hourglass, or the turning of the earth.”  Shadowlands: A Journey Through Lost Britain by Matthew Green is published by Faber (£20).
