3/16/2022,"1993: the Conservative government of John Major sets up the national lottery. It is franchised to a private operator, Canadian-owned Camelot, the following year. 1994; nearly 22 million people watch the first ever national lottery draw, broadcast via a special primetime TV event hosted by Noel Edmonds. 2001; Camelot retains the franchise after a bitter battle with Sir Richard Branson’s venture, dubbed the People’s Lottery. Branson fails in a claim for £18m in compensation over the process. 2002; after a period of falling sales, the lottery undergoes a major rebranding, with the main draw renamed Lotto. 2007: Camelot wins the franchise for a third time. 2013: Camelot increases the price of a Lotto ticket to £2, the first rise since it began. 2016; the jackpot climbs to a record £66m and is shared by two ticket holders, who win £33m each. 2017: public spending watchdog the National Audit Office criticises Camelot for failing to increase returns to good causes in line with its increase in profits. 2021: the minimum age to play the national lottery rises from 16 to 18, amid a broader government push to reduce problem gambling and concern about increasingly popular “casino-style” Instant Win games. 2022: Allwyn, ultimately owned by Czech billionaire Karel Komárek, becomes the first company to depose Camelot, winning a 10-year licence to run the national lottery from 2024.",News/UK news,Timeline: 28 years of the national lottery under Camelot,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/15/timeline-28-years-of-the-national-lottery-under-camelot
3/16/2022,"Czech entrepreneur Karel Komárek celebrated his birthday on Tuesday in the style befitting a billionaire, winning the right to operate the UK national lottery for 10 years. “The best bday present ever,” he declared, via social media site LinkedIn. The seeds of his timely victory were sown three decades earlier, in the aftermath of Czechoslovakia’s 1989 Velvet Revolution against the collapsing Soviet Union. Komárek, who grew up in a two-bedroom flat in the South Moravian town of Hodonín, was 20 at the time. His father lent him $10,000 and he started his own business, selling industrial parts. That business grew into KKCG, an empire spanning oil and gas, property, technology and lotteries. Entrepreneurial success has given the 53-year-old an estimated £6bn fortune and a jetset lifestyle. Komárek, wife Stepanka and their four children can take advantage of homes in the Czech Republic, Palm Beach, Florida and the ski resort of Verbier, in the Swiss Alps. But as Komárek closed in on the lottery bid, his ties to Russia have come under scrutiny. His oil and gas business has included partnerships with Kremlin-controlled gas firm Gazprom, with which he retains a gas storage joint venture. Komárek reacted quickly, condemning Vladimir Putin’s “barbarism” in an open letter. He is now in talks with the Czech government to nationalise the asset and force Gazprom out. The billionaire is used to confronting troubling business disputes head on. In 2002, Komárek sued Scottish oil company Ramco, after it commissioned a report about him following a commercial row. According to court documents, the report, written by a group of former MI6 spies, “implicated the claimants in corruption and in one instance in murder”. Described in court as being akin to a James Bond plot, the allegations were allegedly passed to several high-ranking members of the Czech and British governments, including the then foreign minister, Robin Cook. The allegations were never tested in court because Ramco did not seek to prove that they were true. The trial collapsed and Komárek said he was “disappointed” that no apology was ever made. A spokesperson said Komárek had been the subject of a “malicious accusation that was quickly proven to be false at the time”. They said that Komárek’s business interests had “expanded across Europe and easily passed rigorous proprietary tests” in every country where it operates.",News/UK news,Karel Komárek profile: the entrepreneur who will run UK national lottery,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/15/karel-komarek-profile-the-entrepreneur-who-now-runs-uk-national-lottery
3/16/2022,"All hail Queen Rachael Blackmore of Cheltenham, who finally got to bask in the warm, long and loud applause of her adoring public a full year after first being crowned. Her repeat victory on board Honeysuckle in this year’s Champion Hurdle meant there was no more popular winner on the opening day of the first Festival to open its doors to the public, even if a nasty fall in the next race quickly brought her crashing back to earth. Such is the life of a professional jockey, but her latest big race success was a genuinely heartwarming occasion to be part of. For all her modesty, Blackmore clearly enjoyed the very public acclaim that was so cruelly denied to her by circumstance last year. It was the highlight of a long day. “ARE YOU READY TO ROAR?” the Racing Post’s front page had excitedly enquired of readers and racegoers in a nod to the fabled guttural release that rolls down from the packed grandstand and across the verdant green of the racecourse to greet the start of the opening race at Cheltenham each March. While the answer seemed to be a resounding yes, a false start from the skittish Dysart Dynamo in the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle meant this year’s collective bellow came to a premature end. Although the 70,000 present tried to rally themselves for another visceral outpouring of celebratory joie de vivre when starter Robbie Supple rereleased the tapes and the field finally began motoring on their two-mile trek, the moment had passed. Braying drunks. A tidal wave of tweed and mustard corduroy. Ray Parlour skulling pints in the Guinness Village at 10.30am. Slowly but surely, nature is healing. At least you could certainly be forgiven for thinking so given the almost total absence of face masks adorning the tens of thousands of racegoers who converged on a heartwarmingly sunny Cheltenham for day one of this year’s annual National Hunt jamboree. In the racecard the Jockey Club preached caution, good hand hygiene and the avoidance of congregating in “busy areas”. With punters piling six-deep around the parade ring and at the counters of every available bar, it was resolutely ignored. Pride of place on the front cover went to Blackmore and Honeysuckle, the beaming jockey’s arm raised in triumph following her victory on board the Henry de Bromhead-trained mare in last year’s Champion Hurdle. The undisputed star of that particular Festival, when she announced herself to a wider UK audience by booting home six winners in Gloucestershire, it was a delight to see her get her raucous post-race dues this time around. This year the crowds returned in their droves and as the most enthusiastic among them queued patiently outside the main gates in early morning sunshine, the racecourse itself was bustling with activity. Their dawn gallops done, work riders sat around smoking and sipping coffee, while the blinding studio lights on a gantry overlooking the parade ring illuminated the fresh-faced features of Oli Bell and guests as they recorded ITV’s daily primer The Opening Show. Around the concourse various groups of casual workers received last-minute instruction before bracing themselves for a hard day’s graft in front of griddles and behind beer pumps, while those employed by the more exclusive dining and drinking emporiums engaged in the last-minute buffing and polishing of glass and silverware before the arrival of well-heeled guests. Many of them touched down in a steady stream of helicopters before being driven up a VIP corridor adjacent to the run-in in courtesy chauffeur-driven Bentleys. Oh, how the other half live. It was all a giddy preamble ahead of the first of 28 races scheduled to take place this week, with Irish raiders expected to continue their astonishing dominance of last year. However first blood in the Supreme went to the English, with the fall three out of the Willie Mullins-trained Dysart Dynamo leaving the way clear for Constitution Hill to lead home a Nicky Henderson one-two in the most convincing style. Sent off the 9-4 joint favourite, there was nothing half-hearted about the roars that encouraged Nico de Boinville’s five-year-old mount up the home straight and past the winning post as he left stablemate Jonbon trailing 22 lengths behind. One of three Mullins entries, Kilcruit was a surprisingly distant third. “That was awesome,” said a delighted Henderson, who later saddled the 18-1 outsider Marie’s Rock to win the Mares’ Hurdle. “I know what the second horse is and I would have been very surprised if anything could have done that to Jonbon, so he must be an extraordinary animal. The hype horse earlier on in the year was Jonbon, then this fella woke up from his slumbers at home and we suddenly realised that actually he was very good.” Sadly, it was not all good news for a racing industry still trying to rebuild its reputation after being found seriously in breach of its unwritten social contract with the public following the leak of abhorrent photographs and video footage featuring the desecration of racehorses, and the Festival suffered its first equine fatality of the week in the Supreme in Shallwehaveonemore. In a field of athletic endeavour where occasional casualties are a tragic inevitability, it is to be hoped that in the coming days it is only discarded betting slips and empty pint pots that pile high.",Sport/Sport,Cheltenham’s punters return to give Rachael Blackmore overdue acclaim | Barry Glendenning,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/15/cheltenhams-punters-return-to-give-rachael-blackmore-overdue-acclaim
3/16/2022,"Russian shells and missiles pounded Kyiv, killing at least five people and prompting city hall to impose a 35-hour curfew amid signs the invading force was tightening its grip on the Ukrainian capital. In the east, the airport in Dnipro sustained massive damage overnight, while Russian forces launched more than 60 strikes on Kharkiv. A series of four heavy pre-dawn explosions rocked residential districts of the capital early on Tuesday. One strike hit a 16-storey housing block where fire raged and smoke billowed from the shattered skeleton of the building. The number of people leaving Ukraine as refugees passed three million, in what NGOs have called Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. The UN said that nearly 1.4 million children – almost one every second – had left Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February. On Thursday 24 February, Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. On Friday 25 February, Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer: On Saturday 26 February, Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces. On Monday 28 February, Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in Kharkiv. Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. On Tuesday 1 March, Russian forces bombarded the government headquarters in Kharkiv, and the armoured column continued rolling towards the capital. On Wednesday 2 March, Moscow’s forces took the port and train station in the strategically important city of Kherson, on the Black Sea. Russian paratroopers landed in Kharkiv, after several days of fierce bombardment. Kyiv came under more heavy shelling. A week into the Russian invasion, on Thursday 3 March, the Black Sea port of Kherson became the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Moscow’s forces. On Friday 4 March the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was seized by Russian military forces after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours. On Saturday 5 March a deal to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and the nearby town of Volnovakha collapsed, and residents in occupied Kherson and Melitopol took part in anti-Russia demonstrations. On Sunday 6 March civilians came under fire as they tried to leave areas including Irpin, where a young family was killed. On Monday 7 March Ukraine dismissed as immoral and unacceptable Russian proposals to evacuate civilians along routes into Russia or Belarus. On Tuesday 8 March civilians left Sumy and Irpin in the north, and Russia was accused of violating a ceasefire by shelling a proposed humanitarian corridor from besieged Mariupol. On Wednesday 9 March, a children’s hospital and maternity ward in Mariupol was destroyed by a Russian air strike. On Thursday 10 March a humanitarian convoy trying to reach Mariupol was forced to turn around due to fighting, and airstrikes struck the western city of Zhytomyr. Satellite images showed the extent of the destruction in Mariupol. Drone footage emerged of a Ukrainian ambush on a Russian armoured column just outside Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv. On Friday 11 March Russian airstrikes hit three cities, including two in the country’s west, as the scope of the military offensive widened. On Sunday 13 March Russia struck a military base close to the Polish border that has previously hosted foreign military trainers from the UK, US and other countries. On Monday 14 March a convoy of more than 160 cars left Mariupol in what appears to be the first successful use of a “humanitarian corridor” to evacuate civilians from the besieged port city. Moscow’s forces have stepped up their campaign to capture Kyiv, where one person was killed and several other wounded in a strike on a block of flats in Obolon district. Over the previous few months Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/russia-war-ukraine-complete-guide-maps-video-and-pictures
3/16/2022,"There was a false start to the first race, a tangle of horses that delayed the famous old Cheltenham roar by a few seconds. But when it came it, was full-throated and passionate. “It’s good to be back,” said race-goer John Knowles, a retired builder from Cheshire who was dressed top to toe in emerald green and gold – the colours of his favourite racehorse owner, JP McManus. “I missed Cheltenham last year. I watched it on the telly, but it’s not the same. I’ve been coming here for 30 years and this place grabs you; it’s very special.” The 2021 festival took place behind closed doors because of Covid. The year before, it was staged under something of a cloud as the coronavirus storm loomed, and came to be regarded by many as a super-spreader event. So this year’s festival has been much anticipated. Gold Cup day on Friday sold out more quickly than ever before, and a record crowd – approaching 70,000 – piled into the sun-dappled course for day one on Tuesday. Lauren Hall, 25, a veterinary nurse, was drinking in the atmosphere. She worked at last year’s very different festival. “It was a really strange experience,” she said. “I remember there being drones everywhere filming everything, but there were no people. Walking into this year’s festival was such a thrill. The crowds look enormous. It feels like we have finally put the pandemic behind us. The atmosphere is incredible.” The 2022 festival is once again that riot of colour and life which for many signals the start of spring. Tweed-wearing aristocrats rub shoulders with suited-and-booted reality TV stars, footballers, farmers and fun-seekers. Among the stars out and about on day one were pop stars Ronan Keating and Rod Stewart and the chef and presenter Prue Leith. For some, the focus is to try to win a bit of money, but many others are there to sink as many pints of Guinness or glasses of champagne as possible. This time, after the long, hard years of Covid, Cheltenham is also a place of joyful reunion. Steph Ackrill, who was busy in the tented shopping area selling silk scarves with designs based on the Cotswolds countryside, said she had woken up nervous but was relishing the day. “I’ve been meeting up with people I haven’t seen for two years. There’s lots of hugging going on. Seeing everyone coming in and being reunited is wonderful.” The Irish, who make the pilgrimage to Gloucestershire in their tens of thousands, were also very much in evidence. Among them was a group of twentysomethings from Galway, brothers Cathal and David Newell and their pals Eoin Collins and Stephen Gavin. It was their first trip to Cheltenham. “We’re first-timers; virgins, you could say,” said Collins. David Newell said they had been planning to come for several years. “It suddenly clicked and we could all come this time. We thought we’d be wearing masks and everything, and were worried that it might not go ahead. But there doesn’t seem to be a problem.” Very few people wore masks, and the Guinness village, champagne bars and hospitality tents were packed. “It’s brilliant to be back,” said on-course bookmaker Elizabeth Jeal. “I cried last year. I’m not worried about Covid this year. We’ve just got to get on with it.” John Payne, a councillor for the nearby village of Prestbury, had mixed feelings. “On the positive side it is another step on the path to normal, and the income will undoubtedly help the economy of Cheltenham.” The festival is a huge money-spinner for the area, bringing in an estimated £100m to the local economy. “On the downside, we are still living with Covid. Any large gathering presents a risk of spreading the virus, but it would appear that this is something we are prepared to accept.” It wasn’t all fun and games, however. The horse Shallwehaveonemore suffered a fatal injury after falling at the final fence in the first race. Chris Luffingham, campaigns director at the League Against Cruel Sports, believes too many horses have died at Cheltenham, saying that “new, tighter safety measures need to be introduced to stop this senseless loss of life.” The Jockey Club, which owns and runs the racecourse, is raising money for the people of Ukraine and has renamed a race “the Ukraine Appeal National Hunt Chase”. Jockeys were encouraged to wear armbands in the colours of the Ukrainian flag. But, as ever, many were treating the event as a break from the troubles of everyday life. Maisie O’Reilly, 22, a student supporting her jockey boyfriend Charlie Todd, 21, said: “I had heard a lot about how great the atmosphere was, but it has taken my breath away. After everything we’ve all been through over the last two years, it’s fantastic to see so many people enjoying themselves.’’     ",Sport/Sport,And they’re off!

3/16/2022,"Neil Faulkner, who has died aged 64 of lymphoma, was an archaeologist and writer, editor of Military History Matters and a political activist. He described his pioneering archaeological work the Great Arab Revolt Project (Garp) in southern Jordan and the Sedgeford Historical and Archaeological Research Project (Sharp) in Norfolk as “grounding truth”. Faulkner founded Sharp in 1996 as an exercise in “democratic archaeology”, in which everyone involved, from professional experts to amateur volunteers, worked together. The project, based around the north-west Norfolk village of Sedgeford, initially focused on the remains of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, but excavations widened and the entire history of the parish is being investigated from the Mesolithic to the first world war. The most important discovery has been a large malt-processing complex, with evidence of at least three grain-drying ovens and associated features from around AD800. In addition an iron age hoard of 32 Gallo-Belgic E gold coins known as “staters” was found buried in a cow bone in 2003. This community-based fieldwork at Sedgeford is now one of the largest independent archaeological projects in Britain, and has provided courses and research opportunities for thousands of trainee archaeologists since its inception. Garp was cutting-edge modern conflict archaeology, a 10-year project co-directed with Nicholas Saunders of the University of Bristol, excavating the Arab revolt against the Turks during the first world war. Faulkner admired the mischievous, precocious figure of TE Lawrence, and his brilliance as a military commander and writer, lamenting that the British myth-making machine had turned Lawrence of Arabia into “a metaphor for the imperialism that tore the region apart a century ago”. He empathised with Lawrence’s shattered psyche after the Sykes-Picot agreement that carved up the Middle East after the first world war and betrayed everything the Arabs had fought for. He also admired Lawrence’s skill in uniting previously warring desert clans into a unified fighting machine, seeing in this an analogy for the warring tribes of today’s sectarian left, who would rather argue than take on a common enemy. Lawrence was a liminal character, moving between spaces and cultures. To him, the tribes were a vapour “moving without front or back” that could win against the “rootedness of a standing army”. Faulkner, who knew and understood the importance of landscape, terrain and military strategy, pointed out that Lawrence’s famous war memoir Seven Pillars of Wisdom was studied by the Vietcong, the Taliban and even the US army. I recall working with Faulkner and his team in Jordan, excavating Ottoman tent rings, circles of stones that had weighted down soldiers’ tents in 1917: boy soldiers known as Mehmetçiks – little Mehmets, the equivalent of the British army’s Tommys, conscripted into a war not of their making. Scraping away at sand and soil revealed the detritus of men living together: bits of playing card, tunic buttons, boot leather, cigarette packets, oil lamps. For Faulkner archaeology was about people, whichever side they were on. He drew on his field research for his 2016 book Lawrence of Arabia’s War: The Arabs, the British and the Remaking of the Middle East in WW1. He published about 20 books altogether, including The Decline and Fall of Roman Britain (2000), Apocalypse: The Great Jewish Revolt Against Rome AD 66-73 (2004), Rome: Empire of the Eagles (2008); Digging Sedgeford: A People’s Archaeology (2014, co-edited with Gary Rossin and Keith Robinson), Creeping Fascism: What It Is and How to Fight It (2017), and his last book Empire and Jihad: The Anglo-Arab Wars of 1870-1920 (2021). Archaeology and writing were integral to his life as an activist. For Faulkner, theory and knowledge was little use without practice, and he was a committed revolutionary socialist. His articulate clarity, whether at one of the Brick Lane Debates, which he set up in the East End of London (believing that debate and discussion face to face was more motivating and transformative), or at any of the other meetings he addressed, could up your political game. He was passionate but not messianic – a mentor and inspiration to many young activists. Faulkner wore his learning and authority lightly, listening to and encouraging others. In 2020 he was on the co-ordinating committee of Anti-Capitalist Resistance – its mission statement “revolutionary transformation to meet the compound crisis of ecological disaster, economic collapse, social decay, grotesque inequality, mass impoverishment, growing militarisation, and creeping authoritarianism”. Faulkner was also an accomplished broadcaster, appearing notably on the BBC’s Timewatch, Channel 4’s Time Team and the recent series of YouTube programmes – The History Fix – for Housmans bookshop. This was based on his 2018 book A Radical History of the World, published by the new Left Book Club in its series of radical books sent to its membership. Faulkner, with others, was instrumental in re-establishing the LBC, originally set up in the 1930s by Victor Gollancz, and now run by Pluto Books. As a supporter of the Stop the War coalition and an advocate of the tradition of the political pamphlet and its place in activism, Faulkner, at the time of the first world war centenary, launched the pamphlet No Glory: The Real History of the First World War, regarding the conflict as “a rich man’s war in which 15 million poor men died”. His writing is beautifully accessible, as at the start of No Glory: “The last veteran of the trenches is dead. This is fortunate for our rulers. Were he still alive, Harry Patch’s voice would be heard denouncing their jingoism and warmongering as we enter the centenary of the First World War ... He told Tony Blair to his face that ‘war is organised murder’.” Faulkner studied the state mechanics and human psychology of war – to understand how it builds, the class basis of war, as well as its inverse, revolution. Born in Walthamstow, north-east London, brought up in the Weald of Kent and educated at the Skinners’ school in Tunbridge Wells and at King’s College, Cambridge, where he studied social and political sciences. He taught history and sociology at Fullbrook school in north-west Surrey from 1984 to 1988 and was then head of sociology at the Frances Bardsley school, in Romford, east London for two years before retraining as an archaeologist at the Institute of Archaeology, University College London, where he was joint winner of the Petrie prize. He lived in St Albans, Hertfordshire. He is survived by his partner, Lucy, their three children, Tiggy, Rowena and Finnian, his sister, Maura, and mother, Mary.

3/16/2022,"Covid infection levels in the UK on are on the rise once more. We take a look at the current situation, and what the future might hold. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, based on swabs from randomly selected households, infection levels are rising in the UK. In the week ending 5 March, about one in 25 people in the community in England had Covid, with the figures even higher in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where they were one in 18 and one in 13 respectively. In Wales the latest figure was 1 in 30. Experts say there are likely to be many factors at play, including the relaxation of Covid measures, changes in people’s behaviour – such as increased socialisation and reduced mask-wearing – the rise of the BA.2 Omicron variant, which appears to be more transmissible than the earlier BA.1 Omicron variant, school half terms, and possible waning of immunity conferred by booster jabs. However, it is difficult to unpick which is having the biggest impact, and this may differ around the UK. Sadly, yes. While Covid vaccinations have weakened the link between infections and serious outcomes, they have not broken it. Hospitalisations are already rising in the UK, although it is difficult to unpick how many are directly because of Covid. Dr David Strain, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school, said the length of stay for patients was also increasing. “This is likely to represent a difference in disease course of BA.2 compared to BA.1,” he said. “The increased transmissibility of BA.2 is causing a higher number of patients and staff contracting it even after very brief contact,” he added, which is having an impact on staffing levels. The impact on deaths will take a little longer to become clear, given the lag between people becoming sick and their condition deteriorating. The number of people with Covid in hospital across the UK rose from 10,500 on 26 February to 11,944 on 10 March, in line with rising infections. However, just 254 of them are on mechanical ventilation, reflecting Omicron’s less serious impact than Delta and fact that eight out of 10 adults have had a Covid booster vaccine. Intensive care doctors say that many Covid inpatients are partly or wholly unvaccinated. The UK health secretary, Sajid Javid, has said that the rising numbers were “expected” and are “not something that’s of particular concern”. However, Chris Hopson, chief executive of English hospitals body NHS Providers, has warned that “while it is positive that the overall number in hospital remains low compared to previous waves, rising admissions can have knock-on effects for patient care”. The mood appears to be one of unease rather than alarm. Speaking in a personal capacity, Prof Cath Noakes, an expert in environmental engineering for buildings at the University of Leeds and a member of Sage, said the current situation was not unexpected. “It was always predicted that as restrictions are removed that cases would rise,” she said. “But as this happened at a time when cases were already very high it will have more of an impact both on the pressure on the NHS and the disruption to schools and business from the very high numbers of people who are off sick.” Noakes added it was very important to keep a close eye on hospitalisations and cases among older people, given outcomes for this group could be far more serious. “With the prevalence at least one in 25 and higher in some parts of the UK, the chance of infection is really high and the reduction in testing and lack of requirement to isolate mean that there may be far more infectious people who are still interacting in the community than before,” she said. One concern raised by experts is that public behaviour was still a long way from what it was pre-pandemic, meaning there is potential for a further rise in infections. “I’m expecting cases to go up and down and maybe up again as the balance between increased mixing, immunity following vaccination and infection, and waning immunity shifts, and as the next variant emerges,” said Prof Tim Colbourn of University College London, adding cases could be in the range of 30,000 to 100,000 a day for the foreseeable future. “Hospitalisations and deaths should stay relatively low because of protection via vaccination, drugs and prior infection, and this should apply to new variants too as it has done for previous variants,” Colbourn said, noting excess mortality had been negative since the start of 2022. The UK is not alone in seeing a rise in infections. An increase has also occurred in Germany and the Netherlands, among other countries in Europe, while China has recently reinstated lockdowns in certain hotspots to try to tackle a surge related to the Omicron variant, with Hong Kong warning its hospitals were being overwhelmed. The main reason appears to be low rates of vaccination among older age groups. Recent government data suggests just over 55% of those aged 80 and over have had one dose, with just over 36% having had two and far fewer having had three. In addition, a zero Covid approach means there is little natural immunity in the population. “There are indications that hesitancy is high and actual access to vaccines appear to be an issue,” said Dr Michael Head is a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton. Noakes said a similar situation was unlikely to occur in the UK in the short term. “But it serves as a reminder that this virus is still a killer among an unvaccinated population and that the milder effects that we are experiencing in the UK are almost certainly due to our high levels of vaccination coverage,” she said.",News/World news,How concerning is it that Covid infections are rising in the UK?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/how-concerning-is-it-that-covid-infections-are-rising-in-the-uk
3/16/2022,"A Russian court has fined Marina Ovsyannikova 30,000 roubles (£215) for violating protest laws after she broke onto a live news broadcast on Channel One in an extraordinary demonstration against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The fine was a relatively light sentence for an act of protest that shocked Russian television viewers and earned plaudits from western leaders. Emmanuel Macron of France even offered her consular “protection” and said he would raise her case with Vladimir Putin. In a legal twist, Ovsyannikova was fined not for breaking onto the Channel One set but for a video statement she made before the protest in which she said she was “ashamed” of having worked at Channel One and spreading “Kremlin propaganda”. “These were indeed some of the hardest days of my life,” she told reporters following the short hearing. “I spent two days without sleep. I was questioned for more than 14 hours. They didn’t allow me to reach my family or give me any legal aid. I was in a fairly difficult position.” She also said she wasn’t surprised at her release because she had two children. Friends and supporters feared the worst after Ovsyannikova disappeared into police custody for nearly 24 hours after her arrest, suspecting that prosecutors may be preparing serious criminal charges against her. Russian state media also reported that the powerful investigative committee had opened a case against her. Lawyers spent much of the night scouring local police precincts to find her. She was detained on Tuesday evening after running on to the set of the evening news with a poster that read: “Stop the war. Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” She finally reappeared on Tuesday evening in a Moscow courtroom. In a photograph alongside a lawyer, she appeared unharmed and was wearing the same outfit and necklace in the colours of the Ukrainian flag as a day earlier. The Kremlin had suggested that Ovsyannikova had violated laws on hooliganism that can carry a sentence of years in prison. Lawyers said it was still possible that prosecutors would press tougher charges against Ovsyannikova, but that it was less likely following Tuesday’s hearing. “There are still risks that a criminal case will be opened against Ovsyannikova, but the chances of that have sharply decreased after the fine that she received today,” said Pavel Chikov, the head of Agora International Human Rights Group. “She has been fined not for her performance, but for her video message in which she urged people to protest.” “No case has been opened yet against her performance, and the prosecutor’s office might still decide to do so,” he continued. “But, the fact that she has already received a quick punishment indicates that a political decision has been made not to persecute her further.” Tatiana Stanovaya, a political analyst and founder of R Politik, said that there were probably differing views among Kremlin advisers about how to deal with Ovsyannikova’s case. While some may have lobbied for a tough response, others could have feared a backlash if the mother of two was treated too harshly. “Nobody was ready for something like this ahead of time,” she said. “And the Kremlin wouldn’t have a ready template for how to react.” Several prominent journalists have reportedly left their positions at state media since Ovsyannikova’s protest. “I’m interested by the amount of discontent inside of the system,” said Stanovaya. “Either right now this wave comes to nothing. Or we can see similar protests more and more often – these vocal, desperate acts where people make similar gestures.”",News/World news,Marina Ovsyannikova: Russian journalist fined for live broadcast protest,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/marina-ovsyannikova-russian-journalist-fined-for-live-broadcast-protest
