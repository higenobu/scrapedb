3/5/2022,"Antonio Conte has said that Tottenham’s doctors ought to explain publicly why Oliver Skipp remains out with a pelvic injury as he betrayed his irritation over the midfielder’s continued absence. Skipp last played for Spurs in the 2-0 Premier League defeat at Chelsea on 23 January and Conte said on 8 February that the medical department ought to have him back in two weeks, although he was putting pressure on them to make it seven to 10 days at most. It is likely that it was wishful thinking on Conte’s part. Skipp’s injury – it is called pubic symphysis, probably a hangover from him playing 45 of Norwich’s 46 Championship games while on loan last season – is in an awkward spot to treat. Skipp is similarly frustrated but he does not blame the Spurs medical team. The injury is healing – slowly – and patience for the 21-year-old and Conte has to be the watchword. Skipp will again be in the stands when Spurs host Everton on Monday night seeking to bounce back from their FA Cup exit at Middlesbrough. “Oliver Skipp, it is a pity,” Conte said. “In England, I think that sometimes you should have a [press] conference with the medical department. It is too easy for the doctors to work here because they don’t speak, they don’t explain what happens, you understand? Sometimes I think that could be good … if, in two weeks … to have a good press conference with the medical department to explain about the situation that they are trying to take care of their players. “Skipp is not ready. He’s having this problem with groin pain. He is fighting. He could recover before but maybe something was wrong. And now we have to wait.” Conte said he was “disappointed and frustrated” by the Middlesbrough defeat, although he did not give vent to his rage after the game, as he has done previously. “One thing is to be angry when we lose and another thing is to speak about my reaction and emotion,” he said. “They are two different situations. To avoid this, I try to keep every time the same behaviour, the same way to face the press conference. It’s normal that sometimes you’re angry and other times you can face the situation in a different way. “Tottenham’s story is this – many ups and downs. To be competitive, the first thing that has to happen is to be stable. It’s impossible for any manager to come in and change the story in one second, especially when this club for 20 years has this type of situation.”",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte calls on Spurs doctors to publicly explain Oliver Skipp injury,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/04/antonio-conte-calls-on-spurs-doctors-to-publicly-explain-oliver-skipp-injury
3/5/2022,"Russia has completely blocked access to Facebook in retaliation for the platform placing restrictions on state-owned media. It was later reported that it had also blocked Twitter. The Russian state communications regulator said access had been restricted, according to the state-owned Ria news agency. Facebook and its sister platform Instagram have removed Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik from their output in the European Union this week and did the same with the UK on Friday, which drew an immediate response from the Russian communications regulator. The Roskomnadzor watchdog said there had been 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020, with access restricted to state-backed news services like Russia Today and the RIA news agency. Last week the regulator had announced a “partial” block of Facebook, claiming that the social network had violated the “rights and freedoms of Russian nationals”. Nick Clegg, the president of global affairs at Facebook’s parent, Meta, said blocking the platform would cut off “millions of ordinary Russians” from reliable information, deprive them of communications with friends and family and mean they were “silenced from speaking out”. He said: “We will continue to do everything we can to restore our services so they remain available to people to safely and securely express themselves and organise for action.” It comes as Russia seeks to control the spread of information on the invasion of Ukraine and to move against independent news sources. It follows the blocks imposed earlier on Friday on the BBC, the US government-funded Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle and Latvia-based website Meduza. Meta said on Friday that it was blocking RT and Sputnik in the UK. It followed a request from the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, in a letter a day earlier to TikTok, Twitter and Meta. Meta has already blocked the news organisations across the EU. “Earlier this week, we announced that we’d be restricting access to RT and Sputnik across the EU. Consistent with that action, and following a request from the UK government, we will also be restricting access to RT and Sputnik in the UK at this time,” said a Meta spokesperson. Meta announced on Monday that it had taken down a disinformation network targeting people in Ukraine, comprised of about 40 accounts, pages and groups on Facebook and Instagram. In a blogpost, Nathaniel Gleicher and David Agranovich, Meta’s head of security policy and director of threat disruption respectively, said the networks were run from Russia and Ukraine. “They were operated from Russia and Ukraine and targeted people in Ukraine across multiple social media platforms and through their own websites. We took down this operation, blocked their domains from being shared on our platform, and shared information with other tech platforms, researchers and governments,” they said.",News/World news,Russia blocks access to Facebook and Twitter,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-completely-blocks-access-to-facebook-and-twitter
3/5/2022,"The London stock market has suffered its biggest weekly losses since the start of the global pandemic in March 2020, as investors took fright at the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. Shares plunged in the City following news of a fire and Russian capture of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, with the one-day drop of more than 250 points in the FTSE 100 index taking the weekly loss to 6.7%. European bourses also recorded big falls amid concerns that the impact of the fighting in Ukraine would spread westwards across the continent. David Malpass, president of the World Bank, told the BBC the war was a “catastrophe” for the global economy. Currency and commodity markets also ended ended the week amid fresh signs of turbulence, with a flight to the safe haven of the US dollar, the highest crude oil prices in a decade. Meanwhile, wholesale gas prices reached record levels in both Britain and the EU. The UK National Balancing Point (NBP) benchmark soared above 500p a therm at one point, smashing through the previous all-time high set in December, amid a prolonged surge that caused the collapse of a series of household gas suppliers. The FTSE 100 index in London finished 251 points lower on Friday at 6,998, a 3.5% drop. The German and French stock markets fell more than 4%, taking the Dax in Frankfurt to its lowest levels since late 2020, while the Italian index tumbled 6.2% to its lowest level in more than a year. Europe’s Euro Stoxx 600 index closed at its lowest level in almost a year. Nervous investors were taking few chances ahead of what they expect to be another tough week when markets reopen on Monday. Liam Peach, emerging markets analyst at Capital Economics, said: “Russia has fallen into chaos and we’ll get a clearer sense next week of the impact that sanctions are having on the economy. A dollar bond repayment by Gazprom on Monday will be a litmus test of the government’s (and government-linked companies’) willingness to pay external debt, while inflation figures for the week just gone by (due on Wednesday) are likely to show that the collapse in the ruble started to push inflation higher.” Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: “The FTSE 100 has had a shocker of a week, posting its largest decline since March 2020, and below the 7,000 level to its lowest point since August last year. In terms of weekly performance, the best performers have been in defence, and commodities with weekly gains for BAE Systems, and the likes of Glencore, Rio Tinto and Antofagasta.” Mining and energy stocks have benefited from the boom in commodity prices which saw the price of Brent crude hitting $120 a barrel at one stage. After a jump of $25 a barrel in the past month, the cost of crude ended the week at $115 a barrel. Wheat prices rose to a 14-year high, while corn prices reached their highest level in eight years. Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means that fears over supply will remain front and centre.” He said there is a “new sense of urgency” for the west to try and strike a nuclear deal with Iran. Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine more than a week ago has raised recession risks for the US and European economies – and far more so for Russia, which has been isolated economically by widening sanctions, economists said. US stocks on Wall Street also fell as concerns over the escalating conflict in Ukraine overshadowed the latest non-farm payrolls data that showed a sharp pick-up in jobs growth last month, and a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8%. As stock markets slid, investors piled into investments regarded as safer – gold, currencies like the dollar and yen, and government bonds. British 10-year government bonds recorded their biggest weekly rise in more than a decade. As gilts were in demand, this pushed their yields, or returns to investors, down the most since November 2011. Yields go down when bond prices go up. On the currency markets, sterling lost 1% against the dollar to $1,3210. War in Ukraine has boosted demand for safe-haven investments like and gold. Spot gold rose 1.5% to $1,965 an ounce. The Moscow stock exchange stayed closed all week, while the rouble fell to record lows amid wider sanctions on Russia. The rouble hit a record low of 118.35 per dollar in Moscow on Thursday, and ended the week at 105 per dollar. Caleb Thibodeau, of Validus Risk Management said: “Evolving into arguably the most serious security threat to continental Europe since the Second World War, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia couldn’t have come at a more economically precarious time for the EU.”",News/Business,Ukraine war a ‘catastrophe’ for global economy as stock markets plunge,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/04/ukraine-war-a-catastrophe-for-global-economy-as-stock-markets-plunge
3/5/2022,"When it began, this day was supposed to be one of uplift. Australia’s return to cricket in Pakistan after 24 long years. The Rawalpindi Stadium outside Islamabad. A full crowd coming in to see a touring team go from abstraction to reality. Something historical, something to mark. It was a Friday, the centre of Muslim prayer, with an extended lunch break giving a spiritual heart to the day. There was poignancy, too, marking the loss of Rod Marsh. His death fitted our rough calculus of life: 74 years lived, younger than many, but a good life behind him with many misadventures survived. So the lifting of the spirits remained. There was something of the circle of life and death, of fond farewells in one direction while something new begins. It built up through the afternoon, as the crowds flowed in after prayers to see their opening stand flow past 100, then their next pair do the same. A century for Imam-ul-Haq, someone tied to history for better or for worse thanks to his uncle, Inzamam. The past spoke through the present, even as Pakistan looked to move beyond its past. The news came through: a bomb, a mosque in Peshawar, sectarian violence aimed at the Shia minority. A count of 30 dead with more to come. And at the same time, for anyone driving through Islamabad, it is an ordinary city, a pretty place with students and coffee shops and street markets bounded by mountains, no place of terror. As some who lived there said, the world is full of horrors and beauty. The first do not belong only to our country, the second we have too. You try to hold on to the uplift, then. It’s easier when looking over a teeming stadium, at thousands of people in the ranked seating cheering themselves hoarse at every delivery, blowing their trumpets, roaring approval at someone walking down to field by the boundary. It’s easier when speaking to those from this city who tell you what this moment means to them. In this place, raw human happiness is all around. A tragic day and a wondrous day can happen at the same time, you might tell yourself. They do so every moment. This is the nature of existence. Eventually those of us covering the match piled into cars to head home. We could think in terms of a caveat: that for cricket, at least, that day was something special. Something to warm the heart in a world that needs it, something to strike back against the kind of people who wish only to create cold instead. With the highway humming under our tyres, with sleepiness drifting in, we looked at phones. Saw the pieces of the messages start to form a whole. Blinked and saw it still there. On the day of farewelling one loved player, here was another. Shane Warne, heart attack, 52. This fits no calculus. Perhaps it is generational bias, but anyone who saw Warne play can define their generation by it. Those of any age became children again through the 1990s and 2000s, watching a magician whose only work was delight. Not for the poor souls at the other end of the pitch, but to all those watching on. Warne was the game, while making it something new. Warne was always there, the standard that no one could aspire to be near. Warne was, quite frankly, supposed to live for ever. He will, in a way, but now comes the shock to realise that he also won’t. In corners of the hallways in the grandstand at Rawalpindi, people knelt on squares of carpet and faced Mecca. In the stands, the crowd increased by a factor of 10 after the midday mosque. Way up in one of the light towers, some huge raptor – a hawk or a falcon – left the gantry every now and then to circle over the ground, moving in huge stiff-winged arcs to hunt for prey, riding the currents over the field while its shadow kept pace beneath. Life moves on, and death moves on, and they move together, one and the same. When Imam finished his long grind to his first Test century, he burst into a celebration of wheeling limbs. He hugged Azhar Ali. Then he moved away to kneel under the westering sun, his forehead pressed to the cool green grass in prayer.",Sport/Sport,Tragedies cast shadow as Australia make poignant return to Pakistan | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/04/shane-warne-rod-marsh-pakistan-australia
3/5/2022,"The cricketing world was left in shock and disbelief yesterday after the death of Shane Warne aged only 52, as if collectively bamboozled by one of the ripping leg-breaks that were the hallmark of the former Australia spinner’s iconic career. Pat Cummins, the current Australian men’s captain, was among those struggling to process the devastating news that Warne had died from a suspected heart attack in a villa on holiday on the island of Koh Samui in Thailand. “Warnie was an all-time great, a once-in-a-century type of cricketer,” Cummins said, his players having learned the news as they travelled back to the team hotel after day one of their first Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi. “His record will live on for ever. We all grew up watching Warnie, idolising him, we all had posters on our wall, had his earrings. We loved so much his showmanship, his charisma, his tactics. He just willed himself and his team to win games for Australia. Above all else, his incredible skill as a leg-spinner. “The loss we’re all trying to wrap our heads around is huge. The game was never the same after Warnie emerged and the game will never be the same after his passing. Rest in peace, King.” These sentiments were echoed across the world, Warne having left an indelible mark during a 15-year international career that began in 1992, caught fire with the “Ball of the Century” against England’s Mike Gatting during the following year’s Ashes series and returned 708 Test wickets from 145 caps. He also starred in the 1999 World Cup triumph, named man of the match after taking four for 33 in the final against Pakistan. Sachin Tendulkar, the former India batsman, tweeted: “Shocked, stunned & miserable. Will miss you Warnie. There was never a dull moment with you around, on or off the field. Will always treasure our on field duels & off field banter. You always had a special place for India & Indians had a special place for you. Gone too young!” Ian Botham, a former commentary colleague of Warne’s with Sky, said: “I’ve lost a great friend on and off the playing field” and added that his thoughts were with Jackson, Summer and Brooke, Warne’s children from a 10-year marriage to Simone Callahan that ended in 2005. The news, initially reported by his employer, Fox Sports, came less than 24 hours after Warne had tweeted a tribute to Rod Marsh, the former Australia wicketkeeper who had died from a heart attack aged 74. The word “genius” may be overused in sport but applied to Warne, the chubby, peroxide-haired Aussie Rules fanatic from St Kilda, Victoria, who during an era dominated by fast bowlers almost single-handedly revived the art of leg-spin; as Cummins said, a generation of young cricketers grew up wanting to be him. Warne’s hold over England in particular was legendary, claiming 195 wickets from 36 Test matches after his life-changing first delivery in the storied contest left Gatting flummoxed at Old Trafford. After playing a part in six successive Ashes series wins he saved his best personal performance for the 2005 series, claiming 40 wickets despite dealing with the turmoil of his divorce. It could not prevent England finally breaking Australia’s 16-year stranglehold with a famous 2-1 win but Warne had the last laugh before retirement, held aloft by his team-mates at the Sydney Cricket Ground after the 2006-07 whitewash that saw him become the first bowler past 700 Test wickets and the urn regained. As well as captaining Rajasthan Royals to victory in the first ever Indian Premier League in 2008, and coming out of retirement in Australia’s Big Bash League between 2011 and 2013, Warne enjoyed a fruitful relationship with Hampshire in English county cricket, playing five seasons at the Rose Bowl between 2000 and 2007. In retirement Warne was a strident commentator and pundit for Channel Nine and latterly Fox in Australia, as well as Sky Sports in the UK. Bryan Henderson, Sky’s director of cricket, said: “We are devastated at the loss of Shane. On the pitch, he was simply the greatest. Off the pitch, he was a wonderful and loyal friend. “No words can capture his contribution to the game, and our shock and sadness that he has left us so early. His repertoire of magic on the field, in the commentary box and in life itself will never be forgotten, and our hearts go out to his family and friends on this saddest of days.” The final day of England’s solitary warmup match in Antigua paused for a minute’s silence during the morning session. Joe Root, the England captain, said: “It has shocked us all in the dressing room. He was always a joy to be around, he gave so much energy to the sport. As a kid growing up he was a massive idol of mine and someone you wanted to emulate.”",Sport/Sport,"Pat Cummins leads tributes to Warne, ‘a once-in-a-century type of cricketer’",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/04/pat-cummins-leads-tributes-to-warne-a-once-in-a-century-type-of-cricketer
