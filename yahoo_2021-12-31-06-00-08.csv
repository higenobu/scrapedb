12/31/2021,"A criminal defense attorney began tracking Donald Trump's base online before the 2020 election. His monitoring has made him concerned about the safety of school board members. ""I'm watching them post their home addresses online, their phone numbers,"" he told Insider. Ron Filipkowski, a criminal defense attorney in Sarasota, Florida, wasn't surprised by the violence at the US Capitol during the January 6, 2021 insurrection. By then, he had tracked enough social media posts from right-wing extremists in his spare time to see trouble ahead. He shared warnings on Twitter from The Proud Boys and one of the Oath Keepers, who talked of ""blood lust"" on that day. The activity had picked up, he noticed, after former President Donald Trump urged supporters on Twitter to be there. ""This is their Super Bowl,"" he tweeted about The Proud Boys on December 30, 2020. Filipkowski, a former longtime Republican, began tracking extremists on social media before the 2020 election to help persuade moderates to vote for Joe Biden over Donald Trump. Now, the former Marine and state and federal prosecutor is still keeping a close eye on the far right, working with two researchers he keeps anonymous to monitor live-streamed events, podcasts, radio broadcasts, social media, and dark chat rooms. Every day he watches streamed video of the War Room podcast with Trump's former chief strategist in the White House, Steve Bannon, who Filipkowski describes as a ""chaos agent."" All of that work has left him with one main concern moving forward: The safety of school board members. The cause for alarm goes beyond the rowdy protests at meetings across the country over mask mandates, COVID policies, and race and gender education. ""I'm watching them post their home addresses online, their phone numbers,"" he told Insider of the school board members' personal information. Filipkowski is prolific on Twitter, but he's only sharing some of what he sees. The majority of it can't be shared because it includes ""violence, conspiracies, you know crazy theories."" Things that would get him banned from Twitter, he said. ""For everything I post, I've seen 99 things worse,"" he said. Sometimes his tweets include derisive commentary. For example: ""The editor on this is going to have one of the most difficult jobs in America in 2022,"" he tweeted about GOP Rep. Lauren Boehbert's forthcoming book. Or, he will post screenshots or videos, including one of a ""guy screaming that if the LA City Council doesn't lift their mask mandate 'get your guns' because it's going to be 'civil war'."" Filipkowski's Twitter account, followed by more than 263,000 people, is getting media attention, and he's been doing television interviews about his work. ""You're like Inspector Clouseau out there, assembling all this data,"" CNN host Michael Smerconish commented during an interview with Filipkowski. Filipkowski, 53, has a day job. So why keep doing this after Biden won? He told Insider he believes the country and democracy are in peril. He sees Trump trying to replace elected officials who control voting across the country and says, ""I believe that 2024 could be our last real democratic election."" In a recent op-ed in the Washington Post, Filipkowski detailed how Trump loyalists who promoted and attended the January 6 rally have now made targets of school boards, city and county commissions, secretaries of state, and supervisors of elections. ""They have taken their disparate causes and motives to the local level, refocusing on softer, more vulnerable targets such as local government agencies, because, according to the new motto of one of their ubiquitous leaders, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, 'Local action has a national impact,'"" he wrote. Filipkowski, who taught high school history for a few years, told Insider he feels vested in the challenges facing school board members because he has documented so many of the wild meetings. Many members don't feel protected by local law enforcement, he said, and the activists who are intimidating them are trying to get them to quit. Attorney General Merrick Garland drew attention to the problem when he called on the FBI to address illegal threats against public servants, he said. But the response was ""just bungled,"" with the Department of Justice relying too much on a National School Boards Association's complaint – one that riled Republicans by comparing threats to domestic terrorism. In October, he tweeted a video of Brevard County School Board member Jennifer Jenkins' speech about the threats and harassment she has endured. ""THIS is what the Garland memo was about,"" he wrote, and not about Republicans' ""BS that the FBI is arresting moms for speaking!"" Republicans say the discontent originated with parents but Filipkowski said others are clearly orchestrating the chaos on masks and race education. They include ""influencers, the grifters, the people making money off this and political leaders who are exploiting it for votes,"" he said. Until December 2020, Filipkowski served on Florida's Judicial Nominating Commission after being reappointed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. He resigned in protest over the treatment of former state data scientist Rebekah Jones, who said she was fired for refusing to manipulate COVID data and who was later arrested. Filipkowski's pinned tweet is his resignation letter. His protest hasn't earned him friends in Gov. Ron DeSantis' office, which denies Jones' allegations. ""How either of these characters became left-wing celebrities is puzzling,"" spokesperson Christina Pushaw wrote in an email to Insider. It was surprising to his former law partner Jeffrey Haynes to see Filipkowski change his party registration after years of being a hard-core Republican who was active in the local party. ""His first child's name is Ronnie Reagan Filipkowski,"" Haynes said. Filipkowski had intended to change to Independent in 2021, but after January 6, he said he changed to Democrat the following day. What led him to abandon the GOP, specifically, is a ""long answer,"" he told Insider, but he wrote in his op-ed that he no longer recognized it. He and the other researchers aren't being paid for monitoring the far right, though he hopes to someday make a career in journalism or opposition research for politics. He could have a lot of work, given the direction he expects for the Republican Party. What he has seen online, he said, has left him ""shook"" by how radicalized people have become. Trump has ""created a Frankenstein monster, and it's the MAGA people,"" he said. That Trump gets booed when he talks about vaccines shows how he has lost control, he said. ""That's the base pushing back, saying 'Yo, we're in charge now. Not you,'"" he said.

12/31/2021,"DOVER, N.H. (AP) — A New Hampshire woman violated the state's civil rights law by calling a Black child by a racial slur and threatening to kneel on his neck, a court ruled Wednesday. Kristina Graper, 51, of Dover, was accused of threatening the 9-year-old in May after he accidentally broke her son's toy at a local park. She was prosecuted by the attorney general's Civil Rights Unit in Strafford County Superior Court, which concluded that her conduct was motivated by the victim's race and was intended to terrorize or coerce him. Graper, whose race was not mentioned in the complaint, has been prohibited from contacting the boy or his family or coming within 250 feet of them. She also was given a $2,500 civil penalty, with all but $500 suspended if she complies. Graper did not file a response to attorney general’s complaint. A phone number listed for her attorney was disconnected. The complaint said the encounter distressed the child, who understood the comments to be a reference to the murder of George Floyd last year. He began to cry when he heard her words and has been afraid to return to the park, and will only do so “when other children are there to help keep him safe,” the complaint said. Millions of people watched the footage of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, pleading for air as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck until he stopped breathing.

12/31/2021,"President Joe Biden: People vaccinated for COVID-19 “do not spread the disease to anyone else."" PolitiFact's ruling: Mostly False Here's why: As President Joe Biden heads toward his second year in office of leading the country through a pandemic, he faces the challenge of trying to convince millions of unvaccinated Americans to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The Republican National Committee said Biden has misled Americans about the effectiveness of the vaccine. The RNC tweeted a partial clip of an interview Biden gave to a Dayton, Ohio, TV station that aired Dec. 14. ""This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,"" Biden said in the full interview. ""The unvaccinated. Not the vaccinated, the unvaccinated. That’s the problem. Everybody talks about freedom and not to have a shot or have a test. Well guess what? How about patriotism? How about making sure that you’re vaccinated, so you do not spread the disease to anyone else."" We fact-checked a similar statement by Biden in October when he said people who are vaccinated for the coronavirus ""cannot spread it to you."" We found at the time that studies showed a vaccinated person was less likely to spread the virus, but the risk wasn’t zero. We rated Biden’s statement Half True. That was before the omicron variant was named a variant of concern by the World Health Organization. At the time, Tara C. Smith, a Kent State University epidemiologist, told us: ""Vaccination does significantly reduce transmission from vaccinated breakthrough cases but does not completely eliminate it."" A reader flagged Biden’s more recent remarks and asked us to look at his statement. Now that omicron has spread rapidly across the U.S. in December, we wanted to revisit the question: Can vaccinated people spread COVID-19? We reached out again to experts to see if their understanding has changed about the role the vaccinated play in COVID-19’s transmission. We found that there is not enough data on how many people caught COVID-19 from an unvaccinated person vs. a vaccinated person in recent weeks, but scientists in general said that vaccinated people can also spread COVID-19. Bill Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard, said Biden’s December ""statement is not accurate."" ""We knew that vaccinated people could become infected with delta and shed viable virus in large amounts,"" Hanage said. ""While data are emerging and not yet complete for omicron, this appears to be even more the case for that variant."" Biden’s emphasis on promoting vaccination is rooted in evidence that it helps protect people from serious cases, including hospitalization and death. However, we found that Biden again inaccurately characterized the vaccine when he suggested that a vaccinated individual can’t spread the virus. Any concerns experts had about the accuracy of Biden’s statement before omicron seemed to have been strengthened in the face of this new variant. We emailed spokespersons for the White House to ask for Biden’s evidence and did not hear back. Some early evidence out of South Africa provided hope that the omicron variant may cause a more mild disease than earlier variants, but many patients there were younger, making them less likely to develop severe illness to begin with. Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the president, told reporters Dec. 17 that the seriousness of infection is ""still up in the air right now because there are a lot of confounding issues as to whether or not it is less severe."" Heather Scobie, an epidemiologist at the CDC, wrote in a Dec. 16 presentation that it’s not yet known how easily omicron spreads compared with delta. However, it is ""likely that vaccinated people with breakthrough infection or people infected without symptoms can spread the virus to others."" That statement was similar to one the CDC made in August. A page on the CDC’s website updated Dec. 20 said that the ""CDC expects that anyone with omicron infection can spread the virus to others, even if they are vaccinated or don’t have symptoms."" We read recent statements by Biden administration officials promoting vaccination, and none went as far as Biden to suggest that vaccination completely eliminated the chance of transmission. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters Dec. 17 that even vaccinated individuals should take precautions to reduce the spread. John P. Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medicine, said while we lack data on omicron vaccine breakthrough infections, with delta there's evidence that vaccinated people can spread infections to other people. ""That’s true on an anecdotal level (we all know such cases) and there are a few papers, mostly out of the U.K., on this point,"" Moore said. However, infection spread is less likely when the infected person is vaccinated, he added. ""So, the vaccines work, but they are not perfect… I would expect that to be true also for omicron,"" Moore said. Biden would have been on firmer ground, Moore said, if he had said ""make sure you’re vaccinated, so you’re less likely to spread the disease to anyone else."" Biden is correct that COVID-19 is primarily a disease of the unvaccinated when we look at hospitalizations and deaths, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. However ""vaccinated people can shed virus and be contagious but generally shed virus in lower quantities and for a shorter amount of time."" Offit pointed to a study from Singapore which found that vaccinated individuals who caught COVID-19 ""had a more rapid decline in viral load, which has implications on secondary transmission and public health policy."" The study was done based on cases earlier this year before omicron emerged. Brooke Nichols, a health economist and infectious disease mathematical modeler at Boston University, said ""vaccinated individuals can definitely infect other people. There is enough data to support this."" ""While vaccinated individuals may be less infectious and infectious for a shorter duration of time they are by no means a dead-end host,"" Nichols said. ""When calling it a pandemic of the unvaccinated, though, it makes it sound as those vaccinated individuals aren’t substantially contributing to new cases — which they are (particularly now). Unvaccinated individuals do, however, continue to contribute disproportionately to hospitalizations and deaths."" However, Nichols added, ""I don’t think the data systems in place can tell us anything about the proportion of new infections that originated from a vaccinated or unvaccinated person."" We asked professors if we can draw conclusions from Cornell University, a campus that is having an outbreak even though 99% of the students are vaccinated. Is that a sign that vaccinated people are spreading the virus? ""Your statement is a reasonable inference from what’s happened on campus,"" Moore said, pointing to an article from the student newspaper about the spike of cases in December. ""I’m not saying that’s not happening, only that I’ve not yet seen formal studies on this topic — too soon."" Biden said Dec. 14 that people vaccinated for COVID-19 ""do not spread the disease to anyone else."" White House officials did not respond to our email asking for evidence, but Biden’s statement conflicts with information by the CDC that it is ""likely that vaccinated people with breakthrough infection or people infected without symptoms can spread the virus to others."" While the information from the CDC presentation was a couple of days after Biden spoke, it echoes what the CDC said in August about the potential for vaccinated people to transmit the virus. Experts told us that getting vaccinated protects individuals from severe cases including hospitalization and death and reduces the chance of transmission, but Biden went too far when he suggested that vaccination completely eliminates the chance of transmission.
