2/14/2022,"The alpine slalom skier Dave Ryding insists that Britain’s blank medal tally so far at these Winter Olympics has only made him more determined to ride to the rescue by winning gold this week. Ryding, who clinched his first World Cup victory in Kitzbühel last month, believes the Yanqing course and artificial snow suits his style of skiing. And the 35-year-old says he is prepared to “risk it for the biscuit” – in other words go for broke – when his competition starts in the early hours of Wednesday UK time.  “I am going to have to risk more than normal, but I am in the mindset that I will have to do or die,” said Ryding, who will be competing in his fourth Winter Games. “I’ve had a ninth place at the Olympics, so I have had a decent one, and there is no point going for another ninth. I may as well try to go better – and with slalom the only way is to risk it. The winner will take it all, and I have to go for it. There is no reason why not.” Ryding learned to ski on a dry slope in Pendle, Lancashire that was full of sheep, who would sometimes run across while he was training. On other occasions they would, in his words, “do their business when we weren’t there – a rainy night and you would get a lot of splatters, it was horrible”. However, learning on those dry ski slopes will, he believes, help on the artificial snow he finds himself facing in China. “I don’t know how to describe it other than it is icy and slippy, but when you get your edge into it it is unbelievably aggressive and grippy,” he added. The man known as “the Rocket” also knows that the lack of a medal in the first 10 days has put pressure on him, and other members of the British squad that are still to compete. But he insists that with Team GB’s men’s and women’s curlers still in contention, and high hopes in the two- and four-man bob, Britain’s results could yet be turbocharged in the final week. “Obviously we probably would have liked to medal already but these things are not just given out – there are a lot of open sports where anything can happen,” he said. “It is easy to watch and delve on the negatives but it isn’t all doom and gloom. I have seen much worse situations. As Brits we stick together and we are a hardy nation. I might get a T-shirt – keep calm and watch slalom. “Charlotte Bankes has won three or four World Cups, is rarely off the podium, but on the day of the Olympics, one thing goes wrong and it is over. It is what it is. We do our best and everyone is human, whether it is me or you.” There was better news for Team GB on Sunday as the men’s curling team beat China 7-6 before following that up with a 5-1 win against Denmark, while the women beat Denmark 7-2. But realistically their first shot of a medal is on Tuesday when Kirsty Muir, who finished fifth in the women’s freeski big air, is due to go off in the slopestyle, assuming she gets through qualifying on Monday. But Ryding insists that if Team GB has no medals when he competes it will make him even more determined. “If it still happens that there are no medals when Wednesday comes I will be extra motivated,” he said. “I will dig even deeper. I will do what I can. It is part of sport. I have been in positions where it is not going well for me and I have dug something out. Who knows? We give it our all.” Ryding also conceded that the slalom was particularly open – with 14 people having made the podium in six World Cup races so far this season. “One of those guys who had a podium has to finish 14th, you know? It is as simple as that, but I know it is within me to win and I know I can be reassured I am in the form to do whatever on the day.”",Sport/Sport,From dodging sheep to the Olympic slopes: Ryding sets sights on gold,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/13/dave-ryding-says-britains-lack-of-winter-olympics-medals-will-spur-him-on-for-gold
2/14/2022,"Pep Guardiola has said he wants Raheem Sterling to sign a new contract at Manchester City but claims any decision over the forward’s future will ultimately be taken by the club. Sterling’s deal expires in June 2023 and there has been little progress in negotiating fresh terms. He said in October that he would be open to receiving more game time elsewhere and floated the possibility of a move abroad. The 27-year-old’s form has stuttered over the past year but he scored a hat-trick in the win at Norwich on Saturday, including a fine opener, and his manager emphasised the importance of keeping him on.  “Nobody doubts how important it is,” Guardiola said. “What I want is [day after day] to play good. Not just him, but all the players. If we count the amount of games he has played since we are together, it is a lot. He is a key player. “About the future, I don’t know what is going to happen. The club decides. I give my opinion but of course the club takes the decision all the time.” Sterling started only two of City’s first seven Premier League games this season, at which point he suggested he would consider a move abroad, but has begun all of their past 12. His goals at Carrow Road meant he has already equalled his relatively meagre tally last season of 10 top-flight strikes and Guardiola said fluctuations in fortune should be expected of any player. “I am pretty sure tonight will be massive for his confidence,” he said after the game. “I have known Raheem for six seasons; this season he was outstanding in goals, assists and his contribution to the team and for himself. During that period there are highs and lows, it is part of life. “These are not honeymoons. Always there are problems and you have to solve it. The important thing is to see the next chapter, next games, next moments with a big smile, being positive and trying to do it.” Guardiola said he has not sought a conversation with Sterling in order to ascertain his intentions. “No, what I want is the best for the players,” he said. “I am really pleased if they are happy, but about the contract it is not my business. I have never been involved.”",Sport/Football,Guardiola eager for new Sterling deal but admits club will make final call,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/13/guardiola-eager-for-new-sterling-deal-but-admits-club-will-make-final-call
