2/23/2022,"When Ben Youngs got married in 2015, his best man, Tom Croft, pulled together a collection of his favourite things Youngs had come out with in the years they’d been playing together and published them in a book called … Stuff Ben Said. There was the time Youngs asked if Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger “were really twins”, when he said he “had only just learned he had two lungs”, asked whether the “place with all the stone heads was called Easter Egg Island”, and the one when he called his brother Tom Youngs to ask why his stew was so dry. “Did you add stock?” Tom asked: “Yes, two cubes.” “And did you add water to the cubes?” Pause. “Do I need to?” Youngs has reached another landmark this week. If all goes as it should do, he’ll play his 115th game for England this weekend, and break the England men’s caps record set by Jason Leonard back in 2004 (although he’s still a way off the 137 games Rocky Clark played for England women). Youngs isn’t saying so much this time, he did a podcast with the RFU, and an interview on behalf of one of his sponsors, but otherwise he’s not talking to the press ahead of the game. He doesn’t want to make too much of it when a match against Wales awaits and the title is still on the line.  Which fits. Youngs has never demanded attention, has never been in running for World Rugby’s Player of the Year award, has never been picked as the Player of the Six Nations. He doesn’t have Aaron Smith’s pass or Antoine Dupont’s strength, he wasn’t ever as imposing as Conor Murray or as much of a menace as Faf de Klerk. For long stretches of his career there have been plenty of people who would argue with you whether he was the best scrum-half in the country. Danny Care scored and set up more tries, Richard Wigglesworth was a better kicker. Even now there are plenty of people who wish Eddie Jones would unleash Raffi Quirke or Harry Randall to quicken England up. Youngs used to be pretty sharp himself. He may have a steady and deliberate way with a pass, marked by those two or three steps he often takes before he throws them, but he has a turn of pace too. He has scored 20 tries for England, and the only men who have scored more for them played in the centres or back three. The best, most memorable of them may have been the first, against Australia in 2010, when he beat three men with a dummy and a swerve. That was a demonstration of the raw talent that made him the youngest man to play for Leicester in the league and won him an England call-up soon after. He still has that in him, but you don’t see it quite so often any more. It’s just one skill, now, in what’s become a complete set. Over the years he’s grown into a player who does everything well without doing any one thing spectacularly. This means it’s easy to see what he lacks in comparison to some of his rivals, and easy, too, to overlook how good he is. That’s one reason he gets so much stick. Like Owen Farrell, Youngs cops criticism simply because he’s held on to one of England’s pivotal play-making positions for so long, when there are so many untested players to choose from. What he does have, and has always had, is the faith of his coaches. By the end of his run, Leonard, a cult hero and crowd favourite, had become a specialist replacement, the old head on the bench England would bring on to shore up their scrum. Youngs, though, is still one of the first names on the teamsheet. He was on the bench against Italy last time out, but it was the first time he’d been there in the last two years, when he started every time he was fit to play. He is a key player in Jones’s new England, was a key player in Jones’s old England, just like he was in Stuart Lancaster’s side, and, way back before that, in Martin Johnson’s too. England have, by my count, tried at least 12 other men in his position since he made his debut. There have been Care, Quirke, Randall,Wigglesworth, Willi Heinz for a time, Dan Robson, Ben Spencer, Jack Maunder and Alex Mitchell. Before themwere Lee Dickson, Paul Hodgson and Joe Simpson, who used to play ahead of Youngs in the England age groups because they thought he was the better prospect. Simpson, who is still playing down at Bath, ended up winning one cap, a reminder of how unpredictable a business it is and all the many things that can go wrong along the way – the injuries, the arguments with coaches, the loss of form, the lack of favour. Youngs has been through all that too, and has suffered with depression, and fatigue after he toured with the Lions in 2013 (he twice decided to sit out later tours to spend time with his family). He was dropped by Johnson, Lancaster and Jones but came back, suffered bad injuries in 2012, 2018 and 2019, then came back from those too. He has been in teams that took some beatings: the defeat by Wales in 2013, by them again, and Australia, in the World Cup in 2015, and the loss to South Africa in the final four years later. And here he is at the end of it, about to have more caps than any man ever to play for England and, more importantly, a lot of respect and affection from the people he works with. He’s a man coaches trust and one who players like and look up to. “He is the squadfather,” says Ellis Genge, “if you need some advice, you need some advice.” Just so long as it’s not about geography, anatomy or stew.",Sport/Sport,Ben Youngs takes hard and quiet route towards England caps landmark,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/23/ben-youngs-takes-hard-and-quiet-route-towards-england-caps-landmark-rugby-union
2/23/2022,"A rapist who abducted a young woman and was caught on CCTV carrying her through a deserted Leeds city centre has been jailed for 16 years. Austin Osayande raped his victim in an alleyway and laughed when the attack was over, telling her he was HIV positive.  The crime took place seven years ago and the footage gained widespread coverage. But Osayande was only caught after being linked to it by DNA from a second sexual assault he committed last year while working as a Hermes delivery driver. A judge at Leeds crown court on Wednesday gave Osayande, 40, a life sentence, with a minimum term of 16 years, for the rape. He was jailed for 14 years for the second offence, sexual assault by penetration, to run concurrently. He will be allowed to be considered for parole after nine years and six months. The court heard that the victim had been on a night out with friends and was intoxicated. She was on her way to get a taxi home when Osayande approached her, gathered her up and carried her to a secluded area behind a Sainsbury’s supermarket where he raped her. The court heard harrowing victim statements from the two women. The 2015 rape victim, then aged 24, has not been able to work since the attack, she told the court. It drove her to drink, self harm and a suicide attempt. She said she had lost her confidence, her ability to trust and would have to live with the memory every day of her life. “You took away my freedom of choice because of your selfish gratification, which has since left me numb, degraded and hurt both mentally and physically. “I’ve endured so much pain over the years and will never fully overcome the torture you’ve put me through. No matter how much therapy I’ve had, it will never fully take it away.” The court heard how Osayande delivered parcels to his second victim on a number of occasions. He made a delivery on the day of the attack and said he would come round later for a coffee. She let him in but didn’t have the confidence to ask him to leave when she then realised she did not want him to stay. She tried to push him away during the assault but Osayange was much bigger and stronger. She said in a statement read to the court that she now suffered anxiety going out alone. Her daughter picks up on this and is more clingy. She has separated from her long-term partner because she struggles to trust men and has lost friends. “I just feel like everything is on top of me. And I’m blaming myself. As a result of the attack I’ve pushed everyone away, especially the people close to me. “I am not sure I will be able to be emotional or physical with anyone ever again, and most of all I hate myself for making a stupid choice.” Defence barrister Robert Mochrie said his client wanted, through him, to express “his genuine remorse” for the crimes, which Osayande initially denied before changing his pleas to guilty last month. Jailing Osayande, the recorder of Leeds, Judge Guy Kearl QC, said: “I find you are a sexual predator – you are a danger to women. That danger continued for at least six years – there is no reason to think it will not continue.” After the hearing Pat Twiggs, temporary assistant chief constable of West Yorkshire police, said: “Osayande is the absolute embodiment of a dangerous sexual predator. The CCTV footage from 2015 shows him prowling the streets in the early hours, hunting for a woman to sexually attack for his own twisted gratification. “The traumatic impact that his appalling actions have caused to the victims of both these offences [should not be] underestimated.”",News/Society,Leeds rapist caught on CCTV abducting woman jailed for 16 years,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/23/leeds-rapist-caught-on-cctv-abducting-woman-jailed-for-16-years
2/23/2022,"Bumblebee and butterfly conservationists are among dozens of environmental groups calling on MPs to back amendments removing powers to curtail protest from the government’s crime bill. They are among 32 signatories to a letter urging all MPs to back amendments by the Lords that removed clauses giving powers to police to impose restrictions on protests considered too noisy, and to place conditions on static rallies and one-person protests.  “Defending these freedoms and liberties is an essential part of ensuring our environment is protected and enhanced, and our international commitments adhered to,” the letter says. “Like our most precious habitats, once damaged they are difficult to recover.” Since its introduction at the beginning of last year, the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, a wide-ranging piece of crime legislation, has faced opposition from human rights organisations and protest groups over its proposals to curb peaceful protest. A campaign of public protests under the banner “kill the bill” took place across the UK, bringing together a diverse range of protest groups. In Bristol, protests spilled over into conflict between protesters and police, for which a number of people are now facing charges of riot. After a delayed passage through the Commons, the Lords, heavily lobbied by civil rights groups, proposed a number of amendments removing some of the most controversial anti-protest measures, and was able to vote down a number of other powers criticised as excessively draconian. On Monday, MPs will have their chance to consider peers’ amendments. The justice secretary, Dominic Raab, has already promised to revive a number of measures in the Commons, leaving the stage set for ping-pong between the two houses before the bill can be signed into law. Friends of the Earth coordinated the letter to MPs and signatories also include organisations working to protect wetlands, frogs, dolphins and bats, development organisations such as Cafod and Save the Children, and the Women’s Institute. The Ramblers, the organisation often credited with the most successful direct action in modern history, is also among the signatories; its mass trespass on Kinder Scout in 1932 is said to have led to the creation of the UK’s national parks and walkers’ right to roam. “History has shown that protest is vital to ensure change happens at the scale and speed required,” the letter says. “Without citizens able to hold decision makers to account, strong policies to address the climate and nature emergencies are less likely to be forthcoming and targets more likely to be missed. “Defending these freedoms and liberties is an essential part of ensuring our environment is protected and enhanced, and our international commitments adhered to. Like our most precious habitats, once damaged they are difficult to recover.” “Giving the police power to restrict protests based on noise could unreasonably suppress many non-violent assemblies and marches, and have a chilling effect on free speech,” the letter says. “This has nothing to do with the sort of ‘highly disruptive’ protest ministers have repeatedly pointed to, and the police already have the powers against intimidation and harassment. “The new power would be open to abuse and confusion, with the targets of protests claiming that noise levels cause ‘serious unease’ to encourage the police to act against protests they find inconvenient or embarrassing.”",News/Law,Wildlife groups urge MPs to back protest amendments to crime bill,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/23/wildlife-groups-urge-mps-to-back-protest-amendments-to-bill
2/23/2022," With a lineup featuring Alice in Chains vocalist Layne Staley, Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready and Screaming Trees drummer Barrett Martin, the supergroup Mad Season represented a who’s-who of Seattle’s 90s music scene. It’s only fitting that Mark Lanegan would join the fray. On the group’s 1995 debut Above, he co-wrote the bittersweet duet Long Gone Day with Staley. The pair passed a piece of paper back and forth between them, building the song’s evocative imagery (“Silver spoons affix the crown / The luckless ones are broken”) line by line. Accordingly, Long Gone Day is sombre and driven by acoustic instrumentation, namely Martin’s thrumming percussion, although there’s a distinct smoky jazz lounge vibe thanks to freewheeling saxophone from local legend Skerik. Long Gone Day is also an early, prominent example of the brittle, honeyed side of Lanegan’s voice; his meditative vulnerability stands in sharp contrast with Staley’s more extroverted, anguished yowl. Screaming Trees’ 80s albums for revered punk label SST sounded like grimier REM filtered through hissing 70s hard rock; the band’s later association with grunge was a fluke of geography and luck, after 1992’s thrashing Nearly Lost You landed on the soundtrack to Cameron Crowe’s Singles. By 1996’s underrated swansong Dust, Screaming Trees leaned back into their love of psychedelic rock and metal. The results were kinetic on the standout single All I Know: burned-out Beatles jangle warped by ferocious distortion, snarling guitars and pained lyrics describing the push-pull of a destructive relationship. Fittingly, the thematic distress translated into sonic tension: Delicious moments of delicacy emerge from the tornado-like noise in the form of classic pop harmonies and swirling organ and piano from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers’ Benmont Tench. In the end, All I Know devolves into noisy chaos in parallel with the regret cresting in Lanegan’s voice: “Should’ve been, could’ve been mine.” Lanegan initially launched a solo career while still with Screaming Trees. Among his early works: a 1990 collaboration with Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain on a cover of the folk standard Where Did You Sleep Last Night and acclaimed releases such as 1994’s Whiskey for the Holy Ghost. However, Lanegan’s solo commercial breakthrough came with 2004’s Bubblegum. A collaborative effort – guests included members of Guns N’ Roses and Queens of the Stone Age – Bubblegum also features his lone UK charting single, Hit the City, a duet with PJ Harvey that peaked at No 76. The pairing is inspired: Harvey and Lanegan are kindred spirits in abrasive distorted blues, with his weathered baritone growl a perfect foil for her keening, desperate voice. Accordingly, the urban landscape to which the duo refer is apocalyptic and desolate, devoid of hope and instead full of self-immolation (“I’m Babylon, burned inside out”) and lost souls. Lanegan joined Queens of the Stone Age during the first half of the 2000s and was an instrumental part of the stoner rock band’s commercial ascent. Among other things, he co-wrote the group’s biggest hit, No One Knows, and contributed lead and backing vocals to other songs from 2000’s Rated R onward. On Lullabies to Paralyze’s stomping Burn the Witch, Lanegan wasn’t necessarily the most prominent voice in the mix; that honour went to guest player Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top. But his shadowy, raspy vocals are the menacing id of the arid roadhouse blues song – a creepy role, given that the lyrics are a literal retelling of a witch trial that ends with innocents who “burn to ash and bone” after a mob “cries for blood to twist the tale into firewood”. Lanegan’s occasional whispering line serves as a potent reminder that even the truth won’t necessarily save you – or set you free. Lanegan and Afghan Whigs frontman Greg Dulli had a long creative association throughout the 2000s. The pair linked up frequently in Dulli’s other band Twilight Singers, notably on 2003’s heartbreaking dirge Number Nine, and finally decided to formalise their own partnership as the Gutter Twins several years later. (Yes, the moniker is a self-deprecating reference to the Mick Jagger/Keith Richards union the Glimmer Twins.) The duo only released one album under the name, 2008’s Saturnalia, but the collection’s grinding gothic textures and hypnotic vocals sear like the pain of getting an intricate tattoo. One of the best moments here is the single Idle Hands, a haunted song about what happens when you finally give into darkness and drag someone else along with you in the process. The results, unsurprisingly, aren’t pretty: “There’s nothing I can do / But be the Devil’s plaything, baby / And know that I’ve been used.” Across multiple collaborations starting with 2004’s Time Is Just the Same EP, Lanegan and former Belle and Sebastian member Isobel Campbell established a bewitching vocal dynamic. At times, the pair’s music resembled that of country renegades Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra; at other moments, the contrast between gritty and sweet had far more in common with Nick Cave and Kylie Minogue. A twangy cover of Townes van Zandt’s Snake Song found on their last collaboration, 2010’s Hawk, appropriately enough has more bite than others. The song’s lyrics are an extended metaphor comparing the titular reptile to a seductive-but-sneaky partner who isn’t to be trusted. Campbell and Lanegan sing the song’s more piercing lines in unison (“I got poison / I just might bite you”), underscoring the idea that being deceitful can go both ways in a relationship – and people need to watch their back when dealing with someone so devious. After departing the Queens of the Stone Age fold in a full-time capacity, Lanegan dived headfirst into two album collaborations with the dark electro troupe Soulsavers. They weren’t the only electronic act to request his services, however: enter producer James Lavelle, who recruited him to contribute lead vocals to Another Night Out, a standout track on Unkle’s 2010 full-length Where Did the Night Fall. The cinematic song feels like the denouement of a movie, between its dynamic, string-driven swells and pervasive sense of feeling emotionally bereft. Lanegan’s leathery voice chronicles what sounds to be the last moments of a life well lived (“Are those dead diamonds baby? / Or are they stars gone to sleep?”) with the gravitas and resignation of the protagonist from David Bowie’s Space Oddity. It’s one of his most stunning guest vocals, maybe because its clear-eyed take on mortality and the inevitability of endings came from experience. Released in 2012 and produced by Alain Johannes, Blues Funeral is widely considered one of Lanegan’s very best solo albums. Not only does the LP make room for thunderous anthems (the slightly surreal The Gravedigger’s Song) but Blues Funeral contains one of his biggest sonic curveballs, Ode to Sad Disco. Inspired in part by the Pusher movie trilogy from Nicolas Winding Refn – and built up from a synthpop song called Sad Disco by the Danish musician Keli Hlodversson – Ode to Sad Disco is a soft-around-the-edges dance song with gently undulating beats and keyboards. As the title implies, the song honours the ecstatic dancefloor spirit of Hlodversson’s original. However, the vivid and macabre lyrical references (“a mountain of nails burn in your hands”) and references to seeking out redemption in unexpected places scan as a classic Lanegan spin on the familiar, with a healthy dose of skepticism thrown in for good measure. Although Lanegan possessed one of rock’s most distinctive vocal timbres, he also had a remarkable ability to mould his voice around the contours of anyone with whom he collaborated. That’s a testament to his acumen for working with other musicians – he intuitively understood what a song needed to succeed and when deferring to others made sense. For this funky and faithful 2013 cover of the xx’s Crystalised, recorded in conjunction with the propulsive Los Angeles rock band Warpaint, he and one-time Tricky collaborator Martina Topley-Bird are on equal footing as they engage in a conversation about resolving a tempestuous relationship. The vocal trade-offs are surprisingly even-keeled given the subject matter; at one point, Lanegan calmly notes, “Burn down our home, I won’t leave alive.” But even though the pair unite on certain phrases as the song unfolds (“You just keep on getting closer”) Topley-Bird is always clearly steering the ship. Lanegan remained prolific in the years preceding his death, contributing guest vocals to songs by the Armed, Cult of Luna and Manic Street Preachers and releasing several solo albums. In 2018, he also released his second collaborative album with London-based Duke Garwood, known for work with Savages and Archie Bronson Outfit. The ascetic lead single (and title track) With Animals illuminated the rich nuances and emotional crevices of Lanegan’s voice. Although he sounded wearier than perhaps he had on recent albums, the strength of his lyrical wordplay – he cycles through calling someone a murderer, a sorcerer, a seraphim, and then a drug to him – emerged as subtle brilliance when paired with a solemn orchestral backdrop. Of course, even on songs where Lanegan sounded fragile, his delivery had quiet strength; discounting his ever-present resilience and steely resolve always tended to backfire.",Arts/Music,From Screaming Trees to Gutter Twins: Mark Lanegan’s 10 greatest recordings,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/23/from-screaming-trees-to-gutter-twins-mark-lanegans-10-greatest-songs
2/23/2022,"The deeply strange tragi-romantic farce of Cyrano de Bergerac has been adapted for the movies many times, with famous versions starring Gérard Depardieu and Steve Martin. Now it is revived again as a musical, with screenwriter Erica Schmidt adapting her hit stage version of Edmond Rostand’s 1897’s play, and Joe Wright directing. As in the stage show, this stars Schmidt’s husband Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister from TV’s Game of Thrones), who brings a piercing commitment to the role and he is persuasive in the way that the likes of Depardieu and Martin weren’t. Dinklage takes the title role: the poet, soldier and poignantly insecure would-be lover, finessing the original by showing that the problem is society’s attitude to Cyrano’s restricted height, rather than the traditional silly and unfunnily phallic big nose. This Cyrano has a normal-sized schnoz and perhaps simply not having the tiresome fake prosthesis makes his performance more available and winning.  It is set in 17th-century Paris, although Wright cheekily shows a theatre with an electric follow-spot light. France is at war with Spain, and Cyrano is the hot-headed soldier and swordsman (the script makes a lairy allusion to Cyrano’s, ahem, endowment) who is hopelessly in love with Roxanne (Haley Bennett), a friend since childhood, but too self-conscious about his appearance to say anything. She is being courted by the wealthy, cruel and charmless Duc de Guiche (Ben Mendelsohn), but Roxanne falls head-over-heels for Cyrano’s fellow officer Christian (Kelvin Harrison Jr) who is sweet-natured but hopelessly tongue-tied. So poor, self-effacing Cyrano, wanting nothing more than for his beloved to be happy, offers to ghostwrite Christian’s passionately eloquent love letters and coach him in the language of love. Interestingly, having been bowled over by Christian’s supposed love-rhetoric with all its extravagance, she teasingly tells Cyrano that his own language is “coded”, and there’s something here for literary theorists about Christian and Cyrano standing respectively for high-flown language and base reality. The result is not exactly the screwball comedy you might expect, but something much slower and more solemn, which in its final act decelerates further into the heart-wrenching misery which has undoubtedly (but for me, bafflingly) made it a perennial hit and may yet make this a success to rival Les Misérables. Dinklage always holds the screen with his natural charisma.  Cyrano is released on 25 February in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Cyrano review – Peter Dinklage captivates as letter ghostwriter in musical version ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/23/cyrano-review-peter-dinklage-joe-wright
2/23/2022,"Social mobility experts have warned that government proposals to introduce minimum eligibility requirements for higher education loans in England will hit poorest students hardest, in effect “closing off university prospects at age three” for the most disadvantaged. On Thursday ministers are expected to outline plans that would prevent pupils from taking out student loans to study at university if they fail maths and English GCSEs, as part of its long-awaited response to the Augar review of post-18 higher education funding.  Proposals to introduce a lifelong loan entitlement (LLE), worth the equivalent of four years of post-18 education to support students to train and study throughout their lives through flexible courses, are also expected to form part of the package of reforms, which are likely to be the subject of a lengthy consultation. Headlines, however, are likely to focus on any government proposals to limit student numbers and block candidates who fail to pass GCSE maths or English, which many see as a retrograde step to efforts to widen participation in higher education. Lee Elliot Major, a professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, warned: “If this is implemented crudely it will effectively be closing off university prospects at age three for many poorer children. Our research shows the depressingly strong link between achieving poorly in early-age tests and failing to get passes in English and maths GCSEs at age 16. “Children from the lowest fifth of family income backgrounds are five times more likely to leave school without passes in English and maths GCSEs basic skills than those from the highest fifth of incomes,” he added. “We already label a third of pupils taking English and maths GCSEs as failures – this will only condemn them further.” About 71% of pupils in England achieve a grade 4 in GCSE English and maths, falling to 52% among disadvantaged households. Among English 18-year-olds accepted on university courses, 92% got grade 4 in English and maths in 2020, meaning the 8% who did not might not in future be able to access higher education. Sir Peter Lampl, the founder and executive chair of the Sutton Trust, warned: “Universities are the key route to social mobility, so it is crucial that young people who have the potential to benefit from higher education are able to do so, whatever their background. “The introduction of any minimum grade requirement is always going to have the biggest impact on the poorest young people, as they are more likely to have lower grades because of the disadvantages they have faced in their schooling.” Ryan Shorthouse, the chief executive of the centre-right thinktank Bright Blue and former adviser to the Conservative party on families and education, added: “Restricting access to student loans is not the right way to reduce the government’s subsidy on student loans. It penalises prospective students, disproportionately those from Britain’s poorest families.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Those with the aspiration and commitment to access higher education should be helped to achieve that ambition. To do the opposite smacks of a lack of ambition on the part of the government. It seems more like a case of removing the ladder up, rather than levelling up.” Other headline measures likely to be announced include the freezing of the tuition fee at £9,250 for another two years, until the end of the current parliament. That will result in an effective cut in university incomes from teaching undergraduates, with the value of the tuition fee already considerably eroded by inflation. In real terms its value by 2024 is likely to be much less than £7,000, depending on the rate of inflation. The government is also expected to announce a similar freeze on the threshold earnings for student loan repayments, hitting recent graduates who will find themselves having to make higher repayments as their wages rise more quickly above the threshold.",News/Education,"Minimum GCSE threshold for student loans will hit poorest hardest, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/23/minimum-gcse-threshold-for-university-will-hit-poorest-hardest-say-experts
2/23/2022,"The UK culture secretary has written to Ofcom asking it to look at whether the Russian TV station RT should be allowed to broadcast “harmful disinformation” in the UK, Boris Johnson told the Commons. Challenged by Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions over a “limited sanctions response” to the arrival of Russian forces in Ukraine, Johnson said the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, had contacted the broadcasting watchdog about RT.  Dorries’ letter to the regulator said RT was “demonstrably part of Russia’s global disinformation campaign”, and that it appeared clear the channel would seek to continue this role amid events in Ukraine. “I have concerns that broadcasters such as RT, whom Ofcom have found to have repeatedly breached the broadcasting code in the past, will also look to spread harmful disinformation about the ongoing crisis in Ukraine here in the UK,” Dorries wrote. Johnson announced the review after being challenged by Starmer over RT. “We must also do more to defeat [Vladimir] Putin’s campaign of lies and disinformation,” Starmer said. “Russia Today is his personal propaganda tool. I can see no reason why it should be allowed to continue to broadcast in this country.” Elsewhere in PMQs the Labour leader questioned Johnson over the extent of sanctions imposed on some Russian banks and a handful of individuals, announced on Tuesday. “The prime minister promised that in the event of an invasion, he would unleash a full package of sanctions. If not now, then when?” Starmer asked. Johnson responded by saying the UK was “out in front” on sanctions, saying that further measures would be taken but that it was also necessary to impose them in union with allies. Starmer called for the government’s delayed economic crime bill to be brought forward to help tackle complex networks of Russian money in the UK, and also demanded tougher rules on donations from shell companies. “As it stands, the bill would allow unfettered donations from overseas to be made to UK political parties from shell companies and individuals with no connections to the UK,” Starmer said, calling for the government to back amendments to the bill, currently in the Lords, to tighten this up. Johnson declined to do so, and instead mocked Starmer over the recent revelation that the Labour MP Barry Gardiner had received donations approaching £600,000 from a UK-based lawyer whom, it emerged, was working for the Chinese government. “We have very tough laws, tough rules in this country to stop foreign donations,” Johnson said. “Before he starts chucking it around I would just remind him that the largest single corporate donation to the Labour party came from a member of the Chinese Communist party.” Starmer replied by saying that Putin feared “openness and democracy”, and that the UK response should not be partisan. “He seeks division. We must stay united. He hopes for inaction, so we must take a stand. He believes that we are too corrupted to do the right thing, so we must prove him wrong, and I believe that we can. He added: “So will the prime minister work across the house to ensure that this is the end of the era of oligarch impunity by saying that this house and this country will no longer be home for their loot?” Johnson replied: “I don’t think that any government could conceivably be doing more to root out corrupt Russian money.”",News/Politics,"Russian TV broadcasts in UK a ‘disinformation campaign’, says Dorries",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/23/russian-tv-broadcasts-in-uk-a-disinformation-campaign-says-dorries
2/23/2022,"Very early on, in a chapter titled “Musical Chairs”, we’re told that teachers at a New York City school can’t tell brown girls apart. They call upon Nadira but stare at Anjali; they ask Michaela to answer a question only to hand the marker pen to Naz. “We stand when our names are called, and our teachers halt, confused.” Nadira is Pakistani, Anjali is Guyanese, Michaela is Haitian, and Naz’s family are from Ivory Coast. The students laugh at their teachers, but think: “Her body is not mine is not mine is not mine. And yet.” And yet. In Daphne Palasi Andreades’s boisterous and infectious debut novel, such impulses to simplify identities or lean on stereotypes are dismissed, then turned to dust. A largely plotless coming-of-age story about a group of friends, and a love letter to a community and a city, Brown Girls is set in “the dregs of Queens” and told in eight parts consisting of vignettes and short sentences. Moving in a fairly linear fashion from girlhood to adulthood and even into the afterlife, all the while riding the waves of successes and failures, hopes and tragedies, these could be anyone’s life stories. But it’s the particular microaggressions the girls face, and the collective bonds they forge as a consequence, that set them apart.  At 10, the eponymous brown girls “already know how to be good” and how to cross the “Boulevard of Death” en route to their schools. At 15, they are learning to “memorise the subway lines as if they are the very veins that run through our bodies”. They notice that brown boys’ eyes begin to roam their bodies. By 16 or 17, at dinner with their white boyfriends’ families, they “suddenly become Ambassadors of Third World Nations”. The more ambitious ones go on to Ivy Leagues – where “we don’t look like anybody in these books. And nobody looks like us” – and others on to small and sometimes no jobs. At malls they’re accused of stealing; at mostly white parties they are assumed to be the help. Later on in life, they take tourist trips to “the motherland (fatherland?)”, to countries across Asia and Africa. Always, they return to each other, and to their “hidden, peripheral” homes in Queens, where their friendship and feminism were born. Fiction writers have often used the collective narrator. Recently we’ve had the mysterious buzz of mosquitoes in Namwali Serpell’s The Old Drift, the Greek chorus-like voices of a rock star’s fans in Sarvat Hasin’s The Giant Dark, and a triad of chapters capturing the collective experiences of immigrants in NoViolet Bulawayo’s We Need New Names. Told mostly from the perspective of the plural pronoun “we”, Brown Girls reads like a rap song, like an anthem. Rise up, it says, to the dutiful daughters who listen to their mothers’ commandments and know never to talk back, to the “good immigrants” who have learned to keep their heads down. Rise up and question your histories and legacies, colonialism and the curriculum, everyday sexism and racism, your place in the world, and who you really are. At the beginning of the novel we’re told that, for those who really want to know, these brown girls are the colour of 7-Eleven root beer, the colour of sand at Rockaway Beach, the colour of peanut butter, etc. By the end – no matter who or where they are – they know that there’s no (one) place like home; “existing in these bodies means holding many worlds within us”. Brown Girls, too, holds worlds within its pages.  Brown Girls by Daphne Palasi Andreades is published by 4th Estate (£12.99).
