3/4/2022,"The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, built between 1984 and 1995, is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and the ninth largest in the world. It has six reactors, each generating 950MW, and a total output of 5,700MW. It generates almost a quarter of all electricity in Ukraine. The plant is located in south-east Ukraine in Enerhodar on the banks of the Kakhovka reservoir on the Dnieper river. It is about 200km from the contested Donbas region and 550km south-east of Kyiv. A fire broke out in a training building outside the plant in the early hours of Friday, after being shelled by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. The first report came from an employee at the plant, who posted on Telegram that Russian forces had fired on the facility and there was “a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe”. Ukraine’s foreign minister confirmed the reports at 2.30am, tweeting that the Russian army was “firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out.” He called for an immediate ceasefire to allow firefighters to control the blaze. A short time later, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service reported that radiation at the plant was “within normal limits” and the fire conditions at the plant were “normal”. It reported that the fire was in a building outside the power plant. They later reported that the third power unit at the plant was disconnected at 2.26am, leaving just one of the plant’s six units, unit four, still operating. Early reports of the incident at the power plant sent financial markets in Asia spiralling, with stocks tumbling and oil prices surging further. Ukrainian authorities on Friday morning said the facility was secured and “nuclear safety is now guaranteed”. Earlier, the International Atomic Energy Agency said the Ukraine regulator told the agency that there was “no change reported in radiation levels at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant site”. The US also said their latest information showed no indication of elevated radiation levels at the plant. The US energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, said the reactors “are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down”. Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, 100km north of Kyiv. Some analysts noted the Zaporizhzhia plant is of a different and safer type to Chernobyl, which was the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986. The chances of explosion, nuclear meltdown or radioactive release are low, said Tony Irwin, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University. Irwin, who operated nuclear power plants in the UK for three decades, is a former manager of the open-pool Australian lightwater (OPAL) reactor, Australia’s only nuclear reactor. He said the PWR reactors are “a lot safer” than the reactors at Chernobyl, and did not appear to be damaged yet. The reactors have large concrete contaminants and built-in fire protection systems, he said, adding: “Obviously, it’s not a good idea if you start shooting massive missiles at reactors,” he said. “The PWR [pressurised water reactor] type is a much safer sort of reactor, because it’s a two-circuit design reactor. The water that keeps the reactor cool is on a separate circuit to the second one, which actually supplies the power to the turbine and the outside.” “These reactors have back-up emergency cooling systems as well. In addition to the normal reactor cooling, they’ve got a passive system, they’ve got high-pressure injection systems, they’ve got low-pressure injection systems.”",News/World news,Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant: everything you need to know,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-everything-you-need-to-know
3/4/2022,"The floor of Sydney’s Enmore theatre caved in during a sold-out concert on Thursday night, just weeks after the venue’s long-awaited reopening with the end of Covid restrictions. A tightly packed crowd was gathered at the venue for a sold-out set by the Aria award-winning artist Genesis Owusu. But two songs in, the performance was abruptly halted when the floorboards appeared to give way underneath the carpet, forming a large dip. “There’s a real deep drop … so this is actually really dangerous,” Owusu – who had won the Australian music prize for his album Smiling With No Teeth earlier that day – announced to his audience. “This is like a four-metre drop … you guys are the craziest crowd.” In footage of the incident captured by the University of Sydney student newspaper Honi Soit, the ground can be seen undulating beneath the weight of attendees. BREAKING: The floor of the Enmore Theatre has just collapsed. No injuries reported, the event occured just two songs into tonight's Genesis Owusu gig. pic.twitter.com/14TrjoC0zH Floor at the Enmore just collapsed two songs into @genesisowusu’s set pic.twitter.com/09rhjt0QKr Josh Milch, who was at the concert, described the event as “surreal”. “I was conscious of the fact that the floor felt very bouncy,” he said. “I’m used to that at the Enmore to some degree – feeling like you’re on an old wooden ship. “But all of a sudden, the crowd adjacent to me was considerably lower than they were before. People were befuddled and confused – the Enmore has a natural slope to it, but suddenly it felt like the familiar form had changed. It took time to understand what was going on.” The music critic Bernard Zuel, who was also there, compared the sensation to “a cross between a water bed and a trampoline”. A buckling floor - looking like a cross between a water bed & a trampoline - has stopped the @genesisowusu show three songs in. The crowd standing around it, security standing by too. Can’t see how it can go on. Any engineers in the house? Venue staff at the theatre moved quickly, ushering people towards the edges of the dancefloor and into the foyers. Owusu confirmed afterwards that no one had been injured. “All silliness aside, everyone is safe and in good spirits!” he posted on Instagram, promising to reschedule the performance, which was the first leg of his national tour. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Industry figures mourned the cancellation of a show that had been hailed as a bombastic return to Sydney’s nightlife, where live performance has been severely curtailed under New South Wales Covid restrictions. “The sense is that the scene just can’t catch a break,” said Milch, who works as an arts producer. “This is meant to be a resounding return, an emphatic reaffirmation of Australian music – it was very unfortunate.” Two years of virtually no gigs, @Enmore_Theatre dark for the bulk of it, gigs return, the show is sold out … then the floor collapses. This venue, this industry, just can’t take a trick. Musician Nick Ward, who was also at the concert, said it was testament to the enthusiasm for live music felt by Sydney’s concertgoers after such a long break. “It’s such a moment and just iconic,” he said. “I’m glad that I was there to witness it. If anything, maybe it’s the figurative breaking in of a new wave of people being excited about music again.” In a statement, the Enmore theatre attributed the damage to “relentless rain and excessive water” in the Newtown area, causing structures under the carpet to shift and “[create] an uneven floor”.

3/4/2022,"The occupation of New Zealand’s parliament was fractured from the outset: fascists vied for control with controversial pastors, conspiracy theorists and more moderate anti-mandate protesters. And even as the occupation violently collapsed with rioters lobbing cobblestones at police, the divisions remained. Some shouted “burn it down”, while others tried to restrain them. As New Zealand reacts to some of its darkest days in recent memory, these internal rivalries are, obscurely, a hopeful sign – a reminder there was far more division inside the protest than between the protesters and the wider nation. Right-wing politicians took the occupation as evidence of a sharp rent in the social fabric. The National party leader, Christopher Luxon, gave a speech headlined “A Divided Society”. ACT’s leader, David Seymour, described the country as “splintered”. But while we cannot erase the images of parliament’s lawn burning, nor should we panic ourselves into a false assessment of how deep our social divisions run. Hardline anti-vaxxers remain marginal. In the 2020 election, only 2% to 3% of New Zealanders voted for parties promoting Covid scepticism or conspiracies. Today, 94% of the eligible population is double jabbed, even if some signed up only because they feared losing their jobs. Of course, the 6% of New Zealanders who are unvaccinated does represent tens of thousands of people, and that is alarming. So too the fact that, adjusted for population, New Zealand has three times more consumers of far-right Facebook content than the US. But they are still less than 1% of internet users. New Zealand is not a house divided against itself. The country does not have two large, permanently opposed blocs – think Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland – whose enmity makes governing next to impossible. It’s true some polls found 20% of New Zealanders supported the parliamentary occupation (almost all stated their opposition to vaccine mandates as their reason, rather than support for the darker elements of the protest). Another poll found 25% of New Zealanders believed the government’s Covid response had gone too far. But that same poll also showed 50% the country endorsed Jacinda Ardern’s policy, while 25% want it tougher still. For a democratic nation confronting a controversial policy that has required the state to curtail core liberties, these are natural tensions. Disagreement is a sign not of dysfunction but of healthy democratic debate. Countries can also be surprisingly resilient. The 1981 Springbok tour was divisive in the extreme, yet those wounds healed with time. New Zealand is, overall, a cohesive society. According to Victoria University’s Institute for Governance and Policy Studies, 80% of New Zealanders believe others can generally be trusted. (That is, they rate their trust in others to be at least 5 on a 10-point scale.) The same proportion has faith that the government will solve core social problems. Meanwhile, the Kiwis Count survey shows trust in public services has been high and rising, no matter who is in power. Seen in this light, the parliamentary occupation represents a small, if frightening, loss of cohesion – a fraying at the edges, rather than a great rip in the social fabric. Some of the protesters were already marginalised – disproportionately poor and Māori, they had undoubtedly experienced racism and a sense of not belonging to their society. They were probably in the 20% who do not trust others, or government, very much. Such concerns were then easily channelled into conspiracy theories and violence. This non-negligible group of New Zealanders have, with a worrying intensity and conviction, constructed an alternative reality. A world in which, to take just one touted scenario, the government has invented a fake virus in order to poison the population. They have broken away. The task now is to help them reattach themselves where possible, and ensure there are no further breaks. That is no easy task, for it will require us, paradoxically, to be both tougher and gentler. Tougher in the sense that the police must never again be caught napping, violent and threatening speech must be more forcefully regulated, and something must be done to stop Facebook and other platforms pushing extreme content on users. But gentler too, in that lectures about “following the science” won’t get people out of conspiracy theory rabbit holes – only slow, non-judgemental conversation with trusted friends will. We must also inoculate individuals against misinformation and help them reconnect with their communities, one of the surest defences against extremism. We must confront racism and the economic disparities that damage trust and suppress political engagement by making the poor feel (sometimes correctly) that the elites have everything sewn up. This is a matter not of appeasing the protesters but of supporting the countless New Zealanders who are also poor and marginalised yet chose not to join a violent occupation. While the views of parliament’s occupiers do not yet represent a major threat to social cohesion, their wider spread would. That is the danger we must guard against. But we do so from a position of strength, because we are not hopelessly divided against ourselves.
