3/21/2022,"Environmental and “liveability” pressures that are mounting on south-east Queensland as its population booms will be alleviated under a $1.8bn “city deal”, the prime minister, Queensland premier and Brisbane lord mayor have all promised. The three leaders spoke on Monday morning from inside the Gabba, the stadium that will be knocked down, rebuilt, integrated into a new underground train station and will, according to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, form the heart of a deal which plans for the next two decades. Morrison said the agreement would fund a number of projects designed to address “the positive issue of growth” that was causing “environmental challenges” right across the region. “We want to have a south-east Queensland that is growing,” Morrison said. “But we also want to have a south-east Queensland that is managing that growth responsibly and is ensuring that we are protecting the liveability of the cities that make up south-east Queensland.” The city deal is a collaborative agreement between all three levels of government and industry to fund more than 30 projects or business cases across the region. Infrastructure projects in the deal include a roughly $190m green bridge from the CBD to Kangaroo Point and a $41m upgrade to the Dunwich ferry terminal connecting to Stradbroke Island. There is also $210m towards a growth corridor north of Brisbane in Caboolture West and $40m for an entertainment precinct developed by the Wagner family , linked to their airport and quarantine facility. But the biggest investment will go towards a transport hub for the Gabba, which is slated to be the host stadium of the 2032 Olympic Games. The Woolloongabba Metro station will receive $450m under the city deal which the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said would link the Cross River Rail with the South East Busway. “This is about connectivity, it’s actually another chunk in that armour of infrastructure that is absolutely necessary for the growing population of the south-east,” the premier said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Brisbane’s lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said the signing of the “region-shaping deal” was as historic as the announcement last July that it would host the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The lord mayor said the deal would lay the foundation for 20 years of investment and would allow the south-east to “welcome more people”. “People want to come and live here and I know why, we all know why,” Schrinner said. “The critical thing is dealing with that growth with investment in infrastructure, with investment in the liveability of our region, and this is exactly what the deal does.” Queensland has seen an influx of interstate migration since the start of the pandemic, with more than 30,000 people moving to the sunshine state over the past two years. Many of those new arrivals moved to the Gold and Sunshine coasts, a trend that has seen rents soar in coastal areas and increased pressure on transport corridors. The federal government is committing about $668m towards the deal, the state government $619m, and 11 south-east Queensland councils will jointly stump up about $502m, while industry is to commit another $75m. Transport and infrastructure projects account for many of the deal’s headline projects. But $285m is set aside for a so-called “SEQ Liveability Fund”, $3m will be spent on the business case for a proposed First Nations Cultural Centre in Brisbane and about $35m is earmarked for establishing wetlands to help protect the Sunshine Coast’s Maroochy River catchment against flooding. The prime minister and premier have had a sometimes fractious relationship over recent years, exchanging public criticism over disaster management and handling of the pandemic. But the PM praised Palaszczuk and the mayors, saying the work of preparing for growth and the Games went beyond politics. He denied the announcement of the deal, after years of negotiations, had anything to do with the looming federal election. The premier and lord mayor also spoke about the positive outcomes that can be achieved when all three levels of government worked collaboratively. “This city deal signifies that all three levels of government can work very constructively and very well together when it’s in the best interest of the people of this state,” Palaszczuk said.",News/Australia news,New Gabba train station centrepiece of $1.8bn infrastructure spend in south-east Queensland,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/brisbane-gabba-metro-train-station-centrepiece-of-new-infrastructure-spend-city-deal-south-east-queensland
3/21/2022,"A New South Wales court is being asked to rule on a controversial proposed development at an exclusive girls school in the southern highlands, where locals and scientists are concerned about potential environmental impacts. The school, Frensham, first lodged a development proposal for the construction of bush cabins for students and staff with the Wingecarribee shire council in 2019. The proposal has since been altered amid fierce backlash, and Frensham has brought the matter to the land and environment court to seek a decision on the development application. Court representatives examined the site in person on Friday, hearing from school and community representatives, and hearings are continuing this week. The development, on the grounds of the Mittagong school, would require hundreds of trees to be felled. The school has argued the raised accommodation within the landscape would deliver students an unparalleled experience with the natural environment, making them care more deeply about it. It says the proposed site, known as the Lower Holt, was the only suitable location on the 100-plus hectare plot because it was the only spot that met the education goals. Opponents of the plan claim koalas and wombats would be among the native flora and fauna that will be at risk because of the development. There are additional concerns about the quality of the nearby Nattai River – part of Sydney’s drinking water catchment – due to increased runoff. The development of the cabins (six for students and two for staff) as well as a hall with a common room and kitchen, a communal seating area and on-site parking, would also require two access roads to be built to ensure they were fire-compliant. Almost 250 trees would be cut down, including dozens of natives. Dr Ian Wight, a water scientist and senior lecturer at Western Sydney University, said he was worried about possible impacts on the Nattai River, which runs through the property. “The development is likely to degrade the local environment and, in particular, there are potential impacts to the natural river,” Wright told Guardian Australia. “Every bit of forested landscape that we have is helping to maintain water quality and the ecological health of that river and it currently, in the vicinity of the school, is in very good condition. “I’ve got concerns, particularly with the degree of [land] clearing, that it’s going to threaten the stability of the soils, losing that protective cove.” Wright said he would be “all for” the development if it protected the river system, but that the current plan does not. “We’ve got this vastly swinging environment and there’s nothing better than native vegetation for withstanding the drought and then holding it together in the floods. They’re really sensitive environments.” In a statement, principal Sarah McGarry said Frensham had sought to “minimise any adverse environmental impacts”. “The development has been carefully designed to prevent damage to the river and to prevent runoff and erosion,” she said. “During the construction phase, additional sediment and erosion controls will be in place.” Gaye White, a Frensham neighbour and spokesperson of the community group WinZero, claimed the school had failed to adequately consult with the local community. She held concerns for koalas and other native animals. “You can’t keep allowing these koala-feed trees to be cut down if you’re going to save the koalas,” White said. “This is a primary wildlife corridor.” Former Frensham student and local horticulturist Sarah Cains also opposes the plan, calling on the school she loves to use a different area of the site for cabins. “They’ve got miles of land and it is just insane to put it in a place where there is a category one riparian zone,” she said. McGarry denied claims that the school had not been open to consultation, noting revisions to elevate the cabins and pathways off the ground. She said she was aware of ecological concerns and had “worked very hard” to address them, while the goal remained improve the experience for students. “We have actually received a lot of support from within our Frensham community and the wider local community, but it’s fair to say supporters are not as vocal or visible as detractors,” McGarry said. “We do not believe the opponents of the project represent the majority. “Our end goal here is to enhance the Frensham experience for girls by creating a unique outdoor environmental education program, designed to deepen their understanding and appreciation of the natural environment.” The case is scheduled to run until Wednesday.",News/Australia news,Exclusive NSW girls school seeks court ruling over controversial bush cabin proposal ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/exclusive-nsw-girls-school-seeks-court-ruling-over-controversial-bush-cabin-proposal
3/21/2022,"The day before Hannah Clarke and her children were killed, her estranged husband called a counselling service to ask about behaviour change programs for men at risk of committing domestic violence. He then told the counsellor: “I’m not the one who has a problem.” The Queensland coroner’s court is holding an inquest into the deaths of Clarke and her children – Aaliyah, 6, Laianah, 4, and Trey, 3. The inquest was told Rowan Baxter – the estranged partner of Clarke and the father of the three children – murdered the entire family and killed himself by setting their car alight in the Brisbane suburb of Camp Hill on the morning of 19 February 2020. In her opening remarks on Monday, counsel assisting the deputy state coroner, Jacoba Brasch, told the court that video footage showed Baxter visiting a local hardware store in the days before. He walked down the aisles looking at mower fuels and ultimately bought a jerry can, zip ties and a surface cleaner. That afternoon, Baxter made two separate phone calls to services that offer men’s behaviour programs. Brasch said the inquest would next week be played “chilling audio” of Baxter’s call to one of those services, in which he claimed he did not have a problem. “Sixteen hours later, he did the unthinkable,” Brasch said on the opening day of the inquest. The deaths of Clarke and her children brought significant public attention to the use of coercive control by domestic abusers. Queensland is considering making coercive control a criminal offence. The first witness at the inquest was a Camp Hill resident, Michael Zemek, who was washing his car outside his home on the morning of 19 February 2020. “I heard screaming, a hysterical scream,” Zemek told the inquest. “Very quickly this car had pulled up its front right wheel basically on the driveway. And Hannah was … essentially screaming out ‘call the police, call the police, he’s trying to kill me, he’s put petrol on me’. “Baxter had his hand around her in quite a bear hug, both arms around her. He was sitting in the front seats. “His demeanour was controlled. He didn’t appear to be really crazy and aggressive and trying to do anything like punching or anything like that. It was just a constraining hold. My impression was he had more of a resigned look on his face.” Zemek approached the window as Baxter set the car alight. “It just went bang, a flare just went through. It was a bang and a blackness hit my face. I turned my head around briefly. When I came to look up, the whole of the inside front was ablaze. “My instinct was … I’ve got to get her out. And at that point I don’t know whether Hannah got out herself, that’s a blank for me. “When Hannah came out she was totally ablaze from head to toe. She was in flames. I just grabbed the hose and tried to get her to roll on the ground so I could try to extinguish the flames.” Zemek also told the inquest he did not know until afterwards the children were restrained in the back seat of the car. Another witness, Samantha Covey, recalled Hannah Clarke’s panicked words before she died. “My kids, someone get my kids,” Clarke was heard to say, Covey told the inquest. “I can’t believe he’s done this. Where are my babies? Where are my kids? How could he do this?” Covey recalled listening as Clarke told an off-duty police officer what had occurred. “She said that she was going to take the kids to school, he got in the car and he had a jerry can.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A neighbour, Kerry Fernandez, said she grabbed a fire extinguisher and attempted to put out the fire. She told the inquest that Baxter appeared to be “almost guarding the car” and moved from side to side in an apparent attempt to stop her from using the fire extinguisher. Fernandez said Baxter’s expression was “deadpan, nothing”. “Someone then tapped me on the shoulder and politely said that he was armed. I dropped the fire extinguisher and bolted to the house … the [same] woman came in and said ‘it’s over’,” Fernandez told the inquest. “I looked over at him, he was still in that hunched over position … he had stabbed himself.” Brasch said that later in the inquest, friends of Clarke and Baxter would give evidence about his “appearance, his demeanour, his preoccupations” and “Hannah’s worries that he might kill her”.
