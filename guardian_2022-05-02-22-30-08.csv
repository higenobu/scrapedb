5/2/2022,"Staff at a top London law firm have been told they can work from home permanently – but they will have to take a 20% pay cut. Managing partners at Stephenson Harwood are offering lawyers and other staff the option as City firms try to move beyond solely office-based working in a post-pandemic cultural shift to flexible and remote models. Junior lawyers at the company have starting salaries of £90,000, meaning anyone taking up the officer would lose about £18,000. Stephenson Harwood, one of the top 50 highest earning legal firms in the UK and with its headquarters in London, employs more than 1,100 people and has offices in Paris, Greece, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. A spokesman for the firm told the Times that partners would not be eligible to take advantage of the new working policy. Full equity partners receive an average of £685,000 annually. The new salary sacrifice for full remote working policy is being introduced after the company’s experience of recruiting lawyers during the coronavirus pandemic who were not based in London, where living costs tend to be higher. However, the company said it expected only a few staff to take up the full-time work from home option because “for the vast majority of our people, our hybrid working policy works well”. Staff already have the option of working remotely for two days a week. “Like so many firms, we see value in being in the office together regularly, while also being able to offer our people flexibility,” the spokesman said. While many firms are looking at ways to entice workers thriving on flexible and remote working to return to the office, Airbnb has moved in the other direction, announcing that its staff can live and work anywhere they want. On Thursday, Brian Chesky, Airbnb’s co-founder and chief executive, tweeted that employees could work from anywhere in the country they live without having to take a pay cut. In addition, he said staff have the flexibility to “to live and work in 170 countries for up to 90 days a year in each location”, as part of a plan that will also involve “most” staff connecting in person for about a week every three months. Last month a pilot programme involving more than 3,000 workers at 60 companies across Britain taking part in a four-day working week trial was announced. The scheme, thought to be the biggest trial anywhere in the world, will run initially from June to December. It comes as the push for companies to adopt a shorter working week – crucially with no loss of pay while aiming for higher productivity – gains momentum as a way of improving working conditions.",News/Business,Staff at London law firm can work from home full-time – if they take 20% pay cut,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/02/staff-london-law-firm-can-work-from-home-full-time-if-they-take-20-per-cent-pay-cut
5/2/2022,"It is often said that the US is the world’s oldest democracy. While that is not necessarily incorrect, depending on the definition of “democracy,” it tends to obscure more than it illuminates about the reality of American life. If we start from the assumption that America has been a stable, consolidated democracy for two and a half centuries, the current political conflict seems utterly baffling: where is the anti-democratic radicalization of the Republican party – and so many million Americans – coming from all of a sudden? Is it really plausible to assume that the people who remain united behind Donald Trump and are now openly embracing authoritarianism were fully on board with liberal democracy until recently, before they were driven rightward by the presidency of a moderately liberal politician whose sole “radicalism” consisted of being Black? That the election of a religious elderly white man who has always been a proud centrist pushed them to finally abandon their supposedly “consolidated” democratic convictions? And how can we explain that even those Republican officials who openly stand against Trump seem unwilling to support the necessary steps to strengthen democracy? Earlier this month, Liz Cheney described Russia’s attack on Ukraine as a “reminder that democracy is fragile” and talked about her obligation “to defend our democracy” – yet she doesn’t seem overly concerned with her party’s escalating voter suppression or gerrymandering efforts. Similarly, Mitt Romney warned his audience at a private fundraiser in mid-March that “preserving liberal democracy is an extraordinary challenge” – yet he helped block legislation in the Senate that would have introduced much-needed national standards for voting rights. In general, the few Republican lawmakers in Washington who are opposing the worst excesses of Trumpian authoritarianism have been strikingly unwilling to oppose the ongoing Republican attempts to subvert democracy on the state level. Making sense of the present political conflict requires a more precise understanding of the past and present of US democracy beyond simplistic ideas of “democracy v authoritarianism.” We should start by acknowledging what “democracy” meant in America before the civil rights legislation of the 1960s: a system that was, at least by contemporaneous comparison, fairly democratic if you happened to be a white Christian man – and something else entirely if you were not. The Reconstruction period was a notable exception to this norm. But America’s first attempt at biracial democracy immediately after the civil war was quickly drowned in ostensibly “race-neutral” laws and white reactionary violence from the mid-1870s onwards. After Reconstruction, the country was dominated for decades by a white elite consensus to not only leave the brutal apartheid regime in the south untouched, but to uphold white Christian patriarchal rule within the confines of a restricted version of democracy. By the 1960s, however, that white male elite consensus had started to fracture and America split over the question of whether the country should extend the promise of democracy to all its citizens and finally become a functioning multiracial, pluralistic democracy. Since then, two questions have defined US history: how has the reality and practice of democracy changed? And how has modern political conservatism reacted to those shifting versions of democracy, having emerged in the middle decades of the 20th century very much in opposition to precisely those liberal, multiracial, pluralistic visions? The 1960s civil rights legislation set in motion a process of partisan realignment and ideological sorting – ultimately uniting the forces opposing multiracial pluralism in a Republican party that has been focused almost solely on the interests and sensibilities of white conservatives. And white conservatives tend to define America – “real America” – as a predominantly white, Christian, patriarchal nation. America, to them, is supposed to be a place where traditional authority is revered and white Christian men are at the top. The overriding concern of conservatism as a political project since at least the 1950s, and thus the Republican party’s overriding concern since at least the 1970s, when conservatives became the dominating faction within the party, has been to preserve that version of “real America.” In other words, conservatives’ allegiance has never been to democratic ideals – their acceptance of democracy was always conditional and depending largely on whether would be set up in a way that allowed for the forces of multiracial pluralism to be kept in check. But due to political, cultural, and most importantly demographic changes, the conservative political project has come under enormous pressure. As the country has become less white, less religious, and more pluralistic, the conservative hold on power has become tenuous. Nothing symbolized this threat to white dominance like the election of Barack Obama – an outrageous subversion of what reactionaries understand as America’s natural order. Obama’s presidency dramatically heightened the white conservative fear of demographic change that would supposedly be accompanied by a loss of political and cultural dominance. Republicans understand better than anyone else: in a functioning democracy, they would have to either widen their focus beyond the interests and sensibilities of white conservatives, which they are not willing to do; or relinquish power, which they reject. They are determined to transform the political system in a way that will allow them to hold on to power without majority support, even against the explicit desire of a growing numerical majority of the electorate. It is imprecise to say that conservatives are turning their backs on democracy. Rather than suddenly going from “pro-democratic” to “anti-democratic,” they have been fairly consistent: on board with a restricted version of democracy, but determined to prevent multiracial pluralism. But what about those within the Republican party who are publicly siding against Trump, like Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger in the House, or senators Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski, who are rejecting the Republican party’s embrace of the January 6 attack on the Capitol and the attempt to legitimize political violence? I believe their disdain for Trumpism is sincere – but so is their unwillingness to support the necessary measures to defend liberal democracy. Good on them for refusing to cross over into open authoritarianism; but defenders of multiracial, pluralistic democracy they are not. Their actions are indicative of an important conflict that has long shaped the American right. Some parts of the right were never content with accepting the post-1960s reality and railed against what they saw as the acquiescence and appeasement of the forces of multiracial pluralism. Until recently, the established story of modern conservatism’s emergence insisted that those far-right forces had been marginalized, confined to the irrelevant fringe, by the gatekeepers of the “respectable” right. However, as the latest historical scholarship convincingly argues, rightwing extremism was never fully purged from mainstream conservatism. And after Obama was elected president, the idea that Republicans were selling out “real” America, that more drastic action was urgently needed, was spreading fast into the center of conservative politics. In this view, liberals were winning, destroying the country, and Republican appeasement was complicit. The infamous Flight 93 essay, for instance, which the rightwing intellectual Michael Anton published shortly before the 2016 election, provides the clearest articulation of this worldview. Anton presented Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party as a fundamental threat to America, every bit as dangerous as the terrorists who hijacked four airplanes on 11 September 2001. Anton called on the right to embrace Trumpism because Trump would be willing to go much further to stop this “un-American” threat than any of the “ordinary” Republicans who were “merely reactive” and for whom Anton had nothing but contempt. Since Trump wasn’t bound by norms, traditions, or precedents, he alone could be counted on to do whatever was necessary to fight back against “wholesale cultural and political change” – to “charge the cockpit,” in Anton’s crude analogy, like the passengers of Flight 93 who thwarted an attack on the Capitol. As Anton put it, “Trump, alone among candidates for high office in this or in the last seven (at least) cycles, has stood up to say: I want to live. I want my party to live. I want my country to live. I want my people to live.” Democracy? Who cares about democracy when “real America” is under assault and about to be overrun by radical, “un-American” leftist forces? These are not simply the fever dreams of fringe reactionaries. People like Lauren Boebert, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Matt Gaetz symbolize the rise of far-right extremism within the Republican party, and the widespread siege mentality on the American right is the main reason why their radicalism is widely seen as justified by fellow Republicans. The central fault line on the right is not – and has never been – simply between democracy and authoritarianism. The crucial conflict seems to be between those like Cheney, Kinzinger, and Romney who want to uphold white Christian elite rule from within the confines of a narrowly restricted version of democracy – and those who want to pursue that goal by openly embracing authoritarianism and militant extremism. I am not suggesting that this is a distinction without a difference. It matters whether or not a democratic framework remains in place because, no matter how imperfect, it provides basic protections and some room for real democratization as well as racial and social progress. But the position Cheney, Romney, et al are trying to hold has become untenable. The days of white elite rule within a system of restricted democracy are probably over – America will either slide into authoritarianism or make the leap to multiracial, pluralistic democracy. Public critique of Trumpism matters less than the continued de facto support for an increasingly authoritarian Republican party. The fundamental reality of American politics is that, for now, the Democratic party is the country’s sole significant (small-d) democratic party. In that way, democracy itself has become a partisan issue. It’s a reality with which every lawmaker, every institution, every voter in America has to grapple honestly.

5/2/2022,"The largest active wildfire in the US has forced thousands from their homes in New Mexico, as unusually fast-spreading blazes dot the drought-stricken south-west. People have evacuated from the villages of Ledoux, Mora and Cleveland, located around 40 miles north-east of Santa Fe, to escape the Calf Canyon fire. Fierce winds have blown embers beyond the fire, allowing it to breach containment lines set by about 1,000 firefighters backed by aircraft and bulldozers. Officials in northern New Mexico urged people to flee. “This emerging situation remains extremely serious and refusal to evacuate could be a fatal decision,” said the office of emergency management of San Miguel county. The Calf Canyon fire, which surpassed 100,000 acres on Sunday, is the largest of about a dozen major fires in the south-west spurred by strong winds and parched conditions. Scientists say the climate crisis is turning wildfires into a year-round risk for much of the US west, with high temperatures drying out soils and turning vegetation into kindling. More than a million acres have already burned across the US since the start of this year, more than double the total for the same period last year, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). “Climate change is taking a situation that would be bad for us normally,” said Gregg Garfin, a climatologist at the University of Arizona, “and turning the dial up.” In New Mexico, the Calf Canyon fire was advancing at a rate close to a mile every hour on Friday, due to strong winds, before slowing slightly over the weekend. The conflagration started on 6 April when a prescribed burn set by firefighters to clear out small trees and brush that can fuel fires spun out of control. The blaze merged with another fire a week ago. Residents of Las Vegas, New Mexico, were among those told to prepare for evacuation as the wildfire moved within a few miles of the town. Samuel Coca, general manager of a bar in the town’s Castañeda hotel, told the New York Times he had packed his belongings in case he and his family needed to flee and had also met others who had to leave more quickly. “The first dozen people I spoke with lost everything,” Coca said. “They lost their houses, their ranches, some livestock. It was hard to get through the afternoon without crying.”",News/US news,Thousands flee New Mexico wildfire as blaze breaches containment lines,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/02/new-mexico-wildfire-calf-canyon-thousands-flee
5/2/2022,"Israel has summoned the Russian ambassador over remarks by the Kremlin foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, that Adolf Hitler “had Jewish blood” and that the “most rabid antisemites tend to be Jews”. The remarks were part of Lavrov’s defence of Russia’s policy of “de-nazification” in Ukraine, the Kremlin’s term for a sweeping purge that Ukraine says is a pretext for “mass murder.” In an interview with Italian TV, Lavrov was asked to address how Russia could say it needed to “de-nazify” the country when its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is Jewish. “As to [Zelenskiy’s] argument of what kind of nazification can we have if I’m Jewish, if I remember correctly, and I may be wrong, Hitler also had Jewish blood,” Lavrov said during an interview with Italian television channel Mediaset. “It doesn’t mean anything at all.” “We have for a long time listened to the wise Jewish people who say that the most rabid antisemites tend to be Jews,” Lavrov continued. “There is no family without a monster.” The remarks have sparked a diplomatic row with Israel, one of the few western countries that has yet to sanction Russia over its invasion and has not provided military aid to Ukraine. “Foreign Minister Lavrov’s remarks are both an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error,” said Yair Lapid, Israel’s foreign minister. “Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust. The lowest level of racism against Jews is to accuse Jews themselves of antisemitism.” Israeli officials have also demanded an apology from Russia for the remarks. “His words are untrue and their intentions are wrong,” said the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett. “Using the Holocaust of the Jewish people as a political tool must cease immediately.” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy, called Lavrov’s statement “antisemitic” and said that it is “further evidence that Russia is the legal successor of Nazi ideology”. “Trying to rewrite history, Moscow is simply looking for arguments to justify the mass murders of Ukrainians,” he wrote. Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial, also condemned Lavrov’s remarks as “absurd, delusional, dangerous and deserving of condemnation”. The organisation in March had also attacked Zelenskiy for comparing Russia’s intentions in Ukraine to the Holocaust. Lavrov has addressed Zelenskiy’s religion in the past as Moscow has been pressed to explain how it can “de-nazify” a country with a Jewish leader. In March, shortly after Russia began its war in Ukraine, Lavrov told US broadcaster ABC News: “I think the Nazis and neo-Nazis manipulate [Zelenskiy].” In his interview this week, Lavrov also said he did not want Ukraine to surrender but simply that it “stop resisting”. “We don’t demand that [Zelenskiy] surrender,” Lavrov said. “We demand that he give the order to release all civilians and stop resisting. Our goal does not include regime change in Ukraine.”",News/World news,Israel summons Russia envoy over minister’s Hitler comments ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/israel-summons-russia-envoy-sergei-lavrov-hitler-comments
5/2/2022,"Domenico Criscito could have been 4,000 miles away. Everything was agreed for the defender to join Toronto FC at the start of March, swapping a relegation battle at Genoa for an adventure in Canada. It sounded like the perfect way to wind down a career: playing alongside Lorenzo Insigne, an old friend with whom he has shared family holidays. As the moment of departure neared, however, the thought of abandoning Genoa in such a perilous state gnawed away at him. The Grifone were the first professional club to take a chance on Criscito, signing him from Sporting Volla in Naples and giving him his debut in Serie B at 16 years old. Although his career would wend through Turin and St Petersburg, he always came home to Genoa. Across 20 years, and four separate stints, Criscito has represented them more than 270 times. He has worn the captain’s armband ever since he last returned in 2018. When the time came to say goodbye, he couldn’t. Genoa were 19th in the table, eight points from safety. Criscito was out with a muscle injury – one of a series that have disrupted his season – but believed there was still time to recover and help. Results were improving under the new manager, Alexander Blessin, who led the team on an eight-game unbeaten run, albeit with seven draws. Losses to Verona, Milan and Lazio set Genoa back but victory over relegation rivals Cagliari brought fresh hope. A further win over neighbours Sampdoria – at risk themselves, sitting 16th in the table – on Saturday would have been enough to lift Criscito and his teammates out of the drop zone. The Derby della Lanterna is always one of the most intense fixtures in Italian football, but the raised stakes brought back memories of one of its most memorable editions. The shoe was on the other foot in 2011, with Sampdoria battling against relegation and Genoa heading for a mid-table finish. As Marco D’Ottavi recounted evocatively for the Ultimo Uomo website last week, tensions were through the roof. Graffiti appeared outside Sampdoria’s club shop warning them that “not even Padre Pio [a Catholic saint] can save you”. The then mayor attempted unsuccessfully to arrange for the captains to meet before the game for a symbolic show of peace. Genoa supporters resented the idea that their team might accept a ‘biscotto’ – a mutually acceptable draw – when there was a chance to relegate their rivals. With the scores level at 1-1 in the second half, that sentiment spilled into furious chants against their own team. Then Mauro Boselli, a forward who had played barely 180 minutes all season, came off the bench to score a Genoa winner. There are conspiracists in Genova who believe even today that his goal was a mistake, arguing that Boselli, an Argentinian, only scored because he didn’t speak Italian so well and did not understand that there was an agreement in place for a draw. The match was investigated by public prosecutors as part of a wider betting scandal, but eventually dropped with no charges brought. Defeat did not technically relegate Sampdoria there and then, but the impact on both morale and the standings was too great to overcome. A decade later, neither their supporters, nor Genoa’s, have forgotten how it felt. There was no talk of a biscotto leading into this weekend’s fixture, nor any attempt from the current mayor to get involved. What we got instead at the Marassi was a low-quality but high-tension game between two demoralised teams at the end of a long season. Sampdoria rehired Marco Giampaolo as manager in January, hoping he might recapture the magic that led them to three top-half finishes in his previous stint. Things have not been so straightforward, defeats continuing to outnumber wins, despite an early 4-0 rout of Sassuolo. He set his team up in an unadventurous 4-1-4-1 on Saturday, parking the lines of defence and midfield deep and close together. A 25th-minute goal from Abdelhamid Sabiri only entrenched that position, giving Sampdoria a lead to defend. Daring Genoa to break them down seemed like a solid bet. They are Serie A’s least prolific side, with 25 goals all season. Blessin’s players resorted to pumping crosses into the box, often from deep. Caleb Ekuban threatened to make something of one or two such deliveries, but these were little more than half-chances. In second-half injury time, however, a lifeline arrived. Filippo Melegoni’s ball in from the right glanced off the head of Mattia Destro at the near post and on to the arm of Alex Ferrari. The contact was missed in real-time by the referee, Fabio Maresca, but after a VAR review he awarded a penalty. Criscito picked up the ball and headed for the spot. There are few more reliable penalty-takers in Serie A than the Genoa captain. He had converted eight in a row before this, dating back to 2020. Standing opposite him, in the Sampdoria goal, was Emil Audero, a goalkeeper who only recently returned to their starting lineup after being dropped for poor performance at the start of the year. Criscito aimed for the bottom left corner. Audero saw his side-foot effort coming and plunged to push it away. SaturdaySpezia 3-4 Lazio, Sampdoria 1-0 Genoa, Cagliari -2 Verona, Napoli 6-1 Sassuolo SundayRoma 0-0 Bologna, Udinese 1-2 Inter, Milan 1-0 Fiorentina, Empoli 1-3 Torino, Juventus 2-1 Venezia Monday Atalanta v Salernitana The Genoa player crumpled, pulling his shirt up over his head to hide from supporters behind the goal, the ones he had planned to run and celebrate with. Audero came to console him, planting a kiss on his head in a moment of genuine empathy. “I know what he’s going through,” said the keeper later. “Putting our colours to one side, that was a ‘me or you’ moment. I get it.” Could he truly, though? Can anyone know quite how it felt for Criscito in that moment, a player who chose to stay and help the club that gave him his break 20 years ago, only to instead become the one whose mistake against their most bitter rival could ultimately cost them their top-flight status? Even more than that, he must know that his missed penalty felt to Sampdoria fans like the most exquisite revenge for what happened 11 years ago. Genoa are not relegated yet. With three games remaining, they remain only three points from safety, but the form of Salernitana, who vaulted them into 18th-place and have now won three games in a row, will complicate their hopes of escape. In practice, it is now highly likely that only one out of Genoa, Cagliari or Salernitana can stay up. Perhaps Criscito is still happier to be where he is, fighting this fight instead of watching on, unable to help, 4,000 miles away. But on Saturday he looked like a man who wished the ground where he stood would swallow him whole.",Sport/Football,Sampdoria enjoy derby revenge as Criscito’s cruel miss leaves Genoa in trouble | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/02/sampdoria-enjoy-derby-revenge-as-criscitos-cruel-miss-leaves-genoa-in-trouble
5/2/2022,"Faced with the ongoing Partygate scandal, a porn-watching MP and a potential rout at Thursday’s local elections, the Conservative party chairman Oliver Dowden has gone on the attack. A front-page Mail on Sunday splash accused Keir Starmer and Ed Davey of making a pact to give each other a free run in seats at this week’s polls. The Tories fear a progressive alliance, and Labour and the Liberal Democrats seem to fear saying openly that they want one. What’s going on here, and what could it mean for the next general election? From Dowden’s point of view, on one level this is straight distraction: make a loud noise and hope people look at your opponents, not you. But he is also on to something. In February the Financial Times ran a well briefed story that Starmer and Davey had an informal pact to avoid competing with each other in certain seats: they stand candidates, but make minimal effort in the campaign. It worked for the Liberal Democrats in the Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire byelections, and for Labour in Batley and Spen. Not spending money you don’t have, in seats you can’t win, makes obvious sense. But Dowden is alleging something deeper. His research department has found a dip in the number of Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates standing this May. Some of this is by accident, as local parties don’t have the money or even the candidates to stand in many places. But it’s also happening by design. Finding they have values and policies in common, not just an enemy, Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens are cooperating on a local level, whether their leaders like it or not. But this breaks party rules, and so has to be done under the radar. Of course, in crying foul, Dowden is in danger of hypocrisy – the Tories are well aware of the benefits of electoral pacts. On Thursday, Ukip and Reform UK, the successor to the Brexit party, are standing only a quarter of the candidates they did in 2018, thereby consolidating the regressive vote. And at the 2019 general election there was a clear pact between the Conservatives and the Brexit party, the latter’s candidates standing aside because of shared values and the imperative not to split their vote. It helped deliver a big majority for the Conservatives. Dowden rightly fears the gains progressive parties could make if they replicate such deals. How should Labour and Liberal Democrat leaders react to Dowden’s accusations? Davey and Starmer have both already insisted there is “no pact”. But whatever they say, while the polls show a hung parliament is likely at the next general election, and unless and until Labour secures a consistent 20-point poll lead, these accusations of secret pacts and a “coalition of chaos” will continue. And the ace in Dowden’s pack isn’t Davey but Nicola Sturgeon, whose SNP MP bloc is likely to be decisive in any hung parliament. Labour can try to deny this obvious truth and look evasive, or it can make a virtue of the electoral and intellectual strength of cross-party alliances. Who, after all, wouldn’t want Caroline Lucas the Green MP in their dream cabinet? Upcoming byelections in Tiverton and Honiton and Wakefield will make it obvious once again that there is some sort of deal. Starmer and Davey must own the new politics or mire us forever in the old. On the same note, they should stand up for the morality of standing aside to let a better-placed progressive win. Dowden’s argument is that “backroom deals” deny voter choice. This must be confronted. The reality is that the first-past-the-post voting system means 71% of votes are wasted to the benefit of the Tories. Remember, it takes only 38,000 votes to elect each Tory MP but 50,000 for Labour, 250,000 for the Liberal Democrats and 850,000 for the Greens. First past the post underpins our tribal, adversarial, winner-takes-all politics. The big fraud is an electoral system that shuts out millions of voices, to the Tories’ delight, and locks in a nasty and arrogant political behaviour. By standing aside once and gaining office, progressives could pass legislation for proportional representation so that votes match seats – and usher in a new democracy. Twenty-five years ago this week, the nation celebrated a Labour landslide, won in part because of cooperation with the Liberal Democrats. Later this week in local elections across the land there are seats that Labour or the Lib Dems can’t win but the Tories can lose. The same is true of the next general election. Dowden knows this and fears a pincer movement where progressives focus on all the things that unite them, not the few things that divide. While leaders dither, activists are building a new politics from below. Compass, the organisation I direct, is campaigning for a Labour rule change to allow local parties the right not to stand a candidate where they can’t win. And Labour For a New Democracy is pushing for Labour to back proportional representation. Think of fans invading a pitch, or events such as the fall of the Berlin Wall: if a few people defy the officials, they get carted off, but if everyone does it, the people can’t be stopped. Whether it’s progressive primaries to select candidates, citizens’ assemblies or a commitment to proportional representation, politics is in desperate and obvious need of renewal. A dysfunctional democracy is incapable of even decent behaviour, let alone solving huge challenges such as the climate crisis. But to get there, progressives are going to have to work together. They have a choice: win as one or lose apart. The stakes have never been higher.

5/2/2022,"A first group of civilians trapped for weeks inside the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol was expected to reach a Ukrainian-held city on Monday, as authorities planned more evacuations and survivors told of horrific conditions inside the plant. Hundreds of people remain trapped in underground bunkers and tunnels beneath the sprawling industrial site – the last stronghold of resistance to Russia’s siege of the devastated southern port city – which Russian forces resumed shelling overnight. “The situation has become a sign of a real humanitarian catastrophe,” Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said about 100 civilians should arrive in the city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday. “For the first time in all the days of the war, this vitally needed green corridor has started working,” Zelenskiy said overnight. Some evacuees were initially taken to a village held by Moscow-backed separatists, but were expected to be allowed to continue to Ukrainian-held territory if they wanted. The head of the Donetsk military administration said more evacuations under a UN/Red Cross plan were due to begin on Monday morning, with one Russian news report putting the number of civilians still in the plant at more than 500. One evacuee, Natalia Usmanova, 37, said after leaving the steelworks that she became hysterical whenever the bunker started to shake. “I was so worried it would cave in – I had terrible fear,” she told Reuters, recalling widespread terror and a lack of oxygen underground. Some who were not sheltering in the steelworks also managed to flee without assistance. Anastasiia Dembytska said she took advantage of the brief evacuation ceasefire to leave with her daughter, nephew and dog. She said she had to cross countless checkpoints to reach Zaporizhzhia, waiting 18 hours outside before being allowed to pass. Another woman arrived in a funeral van saying she left Mariupol earlier and had been hiding in a basement in a nearby village. A UN spokesperson, Saviano Abreu, said civilians arriving in Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles (230km) north-west of Mariupol, would get immediate support, including psychological services. A Médecins Sans Frontières team was already in place. There were no apparent plans to pull out the remaining Ukrainian forces still holed up in the plant, however, thought to number up to 2,000 and include members of the Azov regiment, the national guard, marines, border guards and other units. One of the steelworks’ defenders, Denys Shlega, commander of the 12th Operational Brigade of Ukraine’s national guard, said Russian forces resumed shelling the plant on Sunday evening as soon as the civilians were evacuated. Shlega said several hundred civilians remained trapped alongside nearly 500 wounded soldiers and “numerous” dead bodies. “Several dozen small children are still in the bunkers underneath the plant,” he said. Sviatoslav Palamar of the Azov regiment called for wounded fighters to be evacuated too. Mariupol is a key Russian target because its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, open up a land corridor to Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops for what has become the main focus of the invasion: achieving full control of the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine’s military command said on Monday Russia had redeployed several battalions from Mariupol to the heavily bombarded town of Popasna in the Luhansk province of Donbas, with the towns of Rubizhne, Sievierodonetsk, Slovyansk and Barvinkove also coming under heavy attack. “I don’t even want to speak about what’s happening to the people living in Popasna, Rubizhne and Novotoshkivske right now,” said the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai. “These cities simply don’t exist any more. They have completely destroyed them.” Zelenskiy’s office said on Monday at least three people were killed and another three, including a child, were wounded in Luhansk over the last 24 hours, with another four wounded in shelling in neighbouring Donetsk. Another two died in Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region, further west. Western officials say Russia is advancing slowly in its eastern offensive and has captured some villages, but is inflicting heavy civilian casualties through indiscriminate bombing. Ukrainian forces are fighting village-by-village and have retaken ground in places. “Everyone understands that we must hold the line here,” Lt Yevgen Samoylov of the 81st Brigade told Agence France-Presse as his unit rotated out of the frontline near the town of Sviatohirsk. “We cannot let the enemy move closer. We try to hold it with all our force.” The UK defence ministry said more than a quarter of the 120 “battalion tactical groups” – about 65% of Moscow’s total combat strength – deployed in Ukraine may now be “combat ineffective” due to personnel and equipment losses. “It will probably take years for Russia to reconstitute these forces,” it said. Ukraine’s defence ministry said its drones had destroyed two small Russian Raptor patrol boats in the Black Sea, while the governor of the Russian region of Belgorod reported two explosions in the early hours, the latest in a string of fires and blasts in recent weeks at ammunition stores and fuel depots in the area.",News/World news,Mariupol steelworks evacuees heading to Ukrainian-held city,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/mariupol-steelworks-evacuees-heading-ukraine-held-city
5/2/2022,"Since the start of the 20th century, 39 trainers have won the championship on the Flat for the first time. Just five – Frank Butters, Cecil Boyd-Rochfort, Paddy Prendergast, Peter Walwyn and Aidan O’Brien – retained the title the following season. The old saw in football that winning the championship is tough but hanging on to it is even harder seems to hold true in Flat racing, too. But as the racing caravan moves on from Guineas weekend at Newmarket, towards Chester, York and the Derby meeting at Epsom, it is already clear that Charlie Appleby will take a great deal of stopping in his attempt to become No 6 on the list, two decades after O’Brien won his second title in 2002. A one-two for Appleby in the 2,000 Guineas was followed on Sunday by a convincing win for With The Moonlight in the Pretty Polly Stakes, a key trial for the Oaks at Epsom next month. Andrew Balding, John & Thady Gosden, William Haggas and O’Brien, second to fifth respectively in last year’s title race, had 23 runners in all over the three days of the meeting and just one winner: Balding’s Shine So Bright in a handicap on Friday. The Gosden stable could not even muster a runner on Saturday’s card, while O’Brien drew a blank in the Newmarket Classics for the first time since 2014. The man with a record eight Derby winners to his name already does at least head into the next fortnight of Epsom trials with the ante-post favourites for both the Derby and Oaks, however, thanks to the eye-catching performances of Luxembourg and Tuesday in their respective Guineas. Ballydoyle, as usual, has several entries in the Classic trials at Chester this week, including Changingoftheguard, a son of Galileo who won a maiden by six lengths in early April, and is one of five declared runners for the Chester Vase on Wednesday. The likely favourite for the Group Three, though, is New London, unbeaten in two starts, already third-favourite for the Derby – and trained by Appleby. There is already a sense of relentlessness about the Appleby stable similar to the one that surrounded runners from Ballydoyle a few seasons ago, and he has two of last year’s Classic winners – Adayar and Hurricane Lane – preparing to launch their four-year-old campaigns. His stable has sent out 40 winners from 103 runners in 2022, a remarkable strike-rate of 39%, and from his point of view the season has only just begun. There will, of course, be many twists and turns over the next six months, but Appleby could scarcely have made a stronger start to his title defence and his stable will be the bedrock for William Buick as he attempts to win the Flat jockeys’ championship for the first time. With Oisin Murphy serving a season-long ban, Buick may never have a better chance to win the title and while riders including Tom Marquand, Hollie Doyle and David Probert may feel the same way, Buick’s consistency is exceptional, with a strike-rate above 20% in each of the last three seasons.

Murphy had 860 rides on the way to his first title in 2019, but that was under the old system that allowed jockeys to ride at nine meetings per week. The 2022 season will retain the Covid-related protocol restricting riders to one meeting per day, so even the busiest jockeys may struggle to reach 700 rides in the championship period from May to mid-October. Unless injury or a severe suspension intervenes, Buick will surely be Britain’s next champion jockey on the Flat.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Appleby’s champion trainer defence takes some stopping,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/02/talking-horses-charlie-appleby-champion-trainer-defence-takes-some-stopping-racing
