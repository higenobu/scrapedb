4/11/2022,"Several incredibly well-preserved dinosaur fossils were uncovered at Tanis, a site in North Dakota. Scientists believe the dinosaurs died the day a giant asteroid hit the earth 66 million years ago. The findings are the work of paleontologist Robert DePalma, who has previously attracted controversy. Scientists claim to have found a fossil of a dinosaur killed on the day an extinction asteroid struck the Earth 66 million years ago. Scientists say that the perfectly preserved leg of a Thescelosaurus dinosaur, complete with scaly skin, can be dated back to the mass extinction event because of the presence of debris from the impact, the BBC said. It is widely believed that when the 7.5 mile-wide asteroid, approximately the size of Mount Everest, hit the Gulf of Mexico, all non-avian dinosaurs on earth were wiped out. An upcoming BBC documentary looks at a slew of fossils found at the Tanis site in North Dakota. It includes the Thescelosaurus leg, seen in a video here, and the skin of a triceratops, pictured above. The site is rich in well-preserved fossils, including fish, a turtle, and even the embryo of a flying pterosaur encased in an egg. Scientists believe that tiny glass-like particles of molten rock lodged in the gills of fish fossils found at the site were kicked up by the asteroid's explosive impact, the BBC said. ""We've got so many details with this site that tells us what happened moment by moment. It's almost like watching it play out in the movies,"" Robert DePalma, a graduate student from the University of Manchester, UK, who leads the Tanis dig, told the BBC. Prof Phil Manning, DePalma's Ph.D. supervisor at Manchester, told BBC Radio 4's Today program that the discovery was ""absolutely bonkers"" and something he ""never dreamt in all my career."" ""The time resolution we can achieve at this site is beyond our wildest dreams. This really should not exist, and it's absolutely gobsmackingly beautiful,"" Manning said. The documentary, which David Attenborough presents, was filmed over three years and will be released on April 15. In the BBC documentary, Robert DePalma, a relative of film director Brian De Palma, can be seen sporting an Indiana Jones-style fedora and tan shirt. He christened the paleontological site ""Tanis,"" the last resting place of the Ark of the Covenant in the 1981 film ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" per The New Yorker. The findings from Tanis, and the work of DePalma, have attracted controversy over the years. The New Yorker first wrote about the Tanis site in 2019 before presenting the findings in an academic journal. While paleontologists usually cede their rights and curation of the fossils to institutions, DePalma, who had collected few academic laurels until the discovery of the site, insists on contractual clauses that give him oversight over the specimens. He has controlled how the fossils are presented, per The New Yorker. In response to the article, Kate Wong, science editor of Scientific American, said in a 2019 tweet that the findings from the site ""have met with a good deal of skepticism from the paleontology community."" A few peer-reviewed papers have since been published, and the BBC said that the dig team promises more. The BBC also said that it has called outside consultants to verify the specimens. Prof Paul Barrett from London's Natural History Museum looked at the leg and said it was a Thescelosaurus that likely died ""more or less instantaneously."" ""It's from a group that we didn't have any previous record of what its skin looked like, and it shows very conclusively that these animals were very scaly like lizards. They weren't feathered like their meat-eating contemporaries,"" Barrett told the BBC. However, Prof Steve Brusatte, an outside consultant on the documentary from the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC he was skeptical about the dinosaurs' findings for now and would like to see the hypotheses being subjected to the scrutiny of peer review. ""Those fish with the spherules in their gills, they're an absolute calling card for the asteroid. But for some of the other claims — I'd say they have a lot of circumstantial evidence that hasn't yet been presented to the jury,"" he said. Prof Brusatte said that it is possible that some of the animals died before the asteroid strike but could have been exhumed and then buried again by the impact. But ultimately, Brussate said the quality of the fossils trumps the controversy about the event's timing. ""For some of these discoveries, though, does it even matter if they died on the day or years before? The pterosaur egg with a pterosaur baby inside is super-rare; there's nothing else like it from North America. It doesn't all have to be about the asteroid.""

4/11/2022,"A cable news host and the creator of the 1619 Project had a lively debate this week over how “great” was the Greatest Generation. The contentious but collegial exchange was sparked by the sentiment that those who lived in America during the Second World War “brutally suppressed” people of African descent living alongside them in the country. CNN+ anchor Chris Wallace invited Nikole Hannah-Jones, the driving force behind The New York Times’ controversial series the 1619 Project, to be one of his first guests on his show “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace” on the new CNN streaming service. The two disagreed about the 1619 Project’s claim the America cannot separate the reality of Jim Crow, voter suppression, and segregation from the legacy of those born between 1901 and 1927, which has come to be known as the Greatest Generation or the G.I. Generation. Reading from Hannah-Jones’ Pulitzer Prize-winning opening essay to the 1619 Project, Wallace quoted the Howard faculty member saying, “Without the idealistic strenuous and patriotic efforts of Black Americans, our democracy today would most likely look very different. It might not be a democracy at all.” “We like to call those who lived during World War II the Greatest Generation, but that allows us to ignore the fact that many of this generation fought for democracy abroad, while brutally suppressing democracy for millions of American citizens,” he read. Wallace asked her about her contention, saying, “Again, I am in no way minimizing our terrible racial legacy. But in some of these things, aren’t you overstating?” Hannah-Jones answered by asking Wallace, “How would you define democracy?” Wallace answer, “rule by the people,” sparking a back-and-forth that starkly demonstrated two separate mindsets about American history. “If you have half of the country — where it’s in some states majorities, in many other states pluralities, 25 percent of the population, 40 percent of the population, cannot vote, have their vote violently suppressed, where they’re a single one-party, one-race rule in a region where about 30 percent of the population is Black … would you consider that democracy?” The former Fox News staple responded by declaring the young adults from “ethnic neighborhoods in Brooklyn and South Philly” and who “stormed the beaches of Normandy” were not “brutally suppressing Blacks.” Hannah-Jones stood firm, volleying back, “Well, they were.” Wallace was not convinced. He countered saying, “No, they weren’t. You don’t be telling me that a farm, that a kid coming off a farm in Indiana, or a kid who came from Brooklyn, was suppressing Black people.” “Indiana has the largest population of the Klan in the United States. The Klan was raised, was reached first in Indiana,” Hannah-Jones responded. “The average age of a soldier in the Second World War was in his 20s or 30s,” said Wallace, charging that his guest was painting those men “who defended democracy” with a broad brush.” She replied to this assertion, “But a 30-year-old is a fully grown person who can serve in Congress, who can be the mayor, who can act, enact laws and policies — these are not children. These are not babies.” She is not alone in her views. A recent study, released in December of 2021, called “The American Soldier in World War II,” conducted by Virginia Tech and funded in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities reviewed the actual beliefs of white soldiers who fought in WWII and their candid thoughts about race, white supremacy and racial equality. The university’s assistant professor of history Edward J.K. Gitre led the research and determined that the complexion of the generation is more complicated than just the traditional heroic view espoused by so many. “It does speak to a generation,” he said in a recent interview. “The good, the bad, the ugly, heroic, not heroic.” The study guaranteed anonymity to the 300,000 surveys that survived over time by not sharing individuals’ names. An unnamed American soldier in August 1944 wrote in a questionnaire, “White supremacy must be maintained.” He continued, “I’ll fight if necessary to prevent racial equality. I’ll never salute a negro officer and I’ll not take orders from a negroe. I’m sick of the army’s method of treating …[Black soldiers] as if they were human. Segregation of the races must continue.” He was not the only one. A different soldier said, “God has placed between us a barrier of color … We must accept this barrier and live, fight, and play separately.” The unadulterated study of approximately 500,000 soldiers was massive, consisting of 65,000 pages currently stored in the National Archives, the Washington Post reports. Conservative Republicans have also rejected the findings of the 1619 Project, linking it to their attack on what they falsely claim is critical race theory being taught in American primary and secondary schools. The arguments put forth by members of the GOP are that the research is skewed and that it makes young white children feel insecure about the legacy of systemic racism that their ancestors may or may not have participated in. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas used these arguments when he interfaced with then-judge Ketanji Brown Jackson during a Senate hearing before the judge became the first Black woman to be confirmed to the highest court of the nation.",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,‘Aren’t You Overstating?’: Chris Wallace and ‘1619 Project’ Creator Nikole Hannah-Jones Debate If ‘The Great Generation’ Was Racist,https://news.yahoo.com/aren-t-overstating-chris-wallace-204500419.html
