1/2/2022,"A Test average of 10 in 2021, completed with two failures in Melbourne, might have dented the confidence of some players but Zak Crawley certainly talked a good game ahead of his second Ashes appearance.  Crawley emerged as one of the brightest batting prospects in England after what appeared to be a breakthrough 267 against Pakistan in 2020 only for a struggle on the turning pitches of India earlier this year, and then issues outside off stump at home, to turn the 6ft 5in right hander’s flow of runs into a mere trickle.Returning for the Boxing Day Test was always a tall order, not least on a tour without state games and having been bizarrely left out of the England Lions versus Australia A fixture in early December. But though scores of 12 and five followed – the latter during a febrile second evening – Crawley fancies greater rewards lie ahead at the start of 2022. “Obviously I haven’t played my best cricket this last year but I feel in a good place,” he said. “Those stats are misleading sometimes. I have never experienced anything like playing in India, 10 over there felt like a good score at the time. I didn’t feel in great touch in the summer so all of a sudden you’re averaging 10. Six England players currently participating in the Australia’s Big Bash League will return to the UK this week to ensure they are ready for the T20 international series against the West Indies. Sam Billings (Sydney Thunder), George Garton (Adelaide Strikers), Tymal Mills (Perth Scorchers), Reece Topley (Melbourne Renegades), Saqib Mahmood (Sydney Thunder) and James Vince (Sydney Sixers) will all fly home by Friday amid a surge in positive coronavirus cases among BBL squads. The players will leave Australia early in order to adhere to safe-living guidelines before flying out to Barbados later this month for a five-match series that runs from 22-30 January. PA Media “I feel as good as I ever have though and so I don’t look into stats too much. I will certainly look to be a bit more confident and back myself because I know full well I can score a hundred here this week and that’s what I’m looking to do.” Asked about his approach to facing Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc on their home ground in the upcoming fourth Test, Crawley added: “It’s just not fearing them. I feel a few of us on our first Ashes tour, we’re a bit wary of them but there’s no need to be. They’re great bowlers, some of the best in the world, but when you get in as Rooty and Mala [Joe Root and Dawid Malan] have shown, they’ve looked very comfortable at times. I don’t think it will be a tougher test [in Sydney]. “I think the wicket is going to be better, slightly flatter, and it’ll be a bit easier. Having watched the Ashes a fair bit, usually there seems to be a lot more runs here. I am looking forward to that and hopefully that is the case.”",Sport/Sport,‘No fear’: England’s Zak Crawley backs himself to score century in fourth Test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/englands-zak-crawley-confident-in-no-fear-approach-before-fourth-ashes-test
1/2/2022,"Boris Johnson was urged by Conservative MPs and peers on Sunday to address what they say will be a “cost of living crisis for many” in 2022. In a letter, the 20 parliamentarians said rising energy prices would pose more of a problem for consumers in the UK than in other comparable countries and that the government should cut VAT on fuel bills, and remove environmental levies on energy, to ease the burden on families.  The letter was published as a poll of voters in the “red wall” seats that the Tories gained in the 2019 election showed support for Johnson and his party plummeting amid concern that family finances are going to get worse over the coming year. With energy bills rising, tax increases due to take effect in April and inflation on the rise, the cost of living is set to be one of the dominant political issues of 2022. Last week the Resolution Foundation thinktank said costs for average households could rise by £1,200. In their letter to the Sunday Telegraph, organised by Craig Mackinlay, who chairs the Conservative Net Zero Scrutiny group, the MPs and peers say that when the energy price cap is reassessed in April “the likelihood is that domestic tariffs will increase hugely, feeding directly into a cost of living crisis for many and pushing them into what is bluntly called ‘fuel poverty’.” They say that, although energy prices are rising internationally, UK government policies have exacerbated the problem for consumers. “We have almost uniquely caused our energy prices, through taxation and environmental levies, to increase faster than those of any other competitive country,” they write. The signatories, who include Steve Baker and David Jones, both former Brexit ministers, Esther McVey, the former work and pensions secretary, and Lord Lilley, a cabinet minister in the 1990s, say removing VAT on fuel bills would be a “step in the right direction” and that getting rid of environmental levies on energy would cut fuel bills by 23%. In an article for the Mail on Sunday, the Conservative MP Lee Anderson, who won Ashfield from Labour at the last election, says his voters care about rising energy bills far more than they do about “platitudes spouted about the ‘green agenda’”. Anderson’s article was published alongside the results of a Deltapoll survey of people living in the 57 seats gained by the Conservatives at the last election, suggesting that Labour is now on 49% in these constituencies and the Tories on just 33%. The same poll suggests that, across Britain as a whole, Labour is on 40% and the Conservatives 35%. Deltapoll said if these results were replicated at a general election Johnson would lose more than 100 seats. The survey asked more detailed questions of voters living in the “red wall” seats gained by Johnson in 2019, suggesting that 40% of them think their household finances are in a worse state since the Tories came to power, against only 12% who say they are better off. Over the coming year 41% expect to be worse off, and 16% better off. By a margin of two to one, voters in these seats do not think Johnson is doing well, the poll suggests, and only a quarter of them think he will still be PM this time next year. These voters also think the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, would be a better PM (38%) than Johnson (33%), the poll suggests. And, when asked for their preferred team, 40% opt for Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, while just 33% choose Johnson and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson urged by Tory MPs to address ‘cost of living crisis’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/02/boris-johnson-urged-by-tory-mps-to-address-cost-of-living-crisis
1/2/2022,"One in three Americans believe violence against the government is sometimes justified, according to a new Washington Post poll.  The survey, with the University of Maryland, was released on New Year’s Day – five days short of a year since rioters attacked the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn Donald Trump’s election defeat by Joe Biden. According to the authors of The Steal, a new book on Republican attempts to fulfill Trump’s aim through legal action in key states, the rioters of 6 January 2021 “had no more chance of overthrowing the US government than hippies in 1967 had trying to levitate the Pentagon”. But it was still by far the most serious attack on the seat of federal government since the British burned Washington in 1814 and the Post poll comes amid a sea of warnings of growing domestic strife, even of a second civil war. The Post reported: “The percentage of Americans who say violent action against the government is justified at times stands at 34%, which is considerably higher than in past polls by the Post or other major news organisations dating back more than two decades. “… The view is partisan: The new survey finds 40% of Republicans, 41% of independents and 23% of Democrats saying violence is sometimes justified.” Other polls have found that more than half of Republicans believe Trump’s lie that Biden won the White House thanks to electoral fraud, and do not trust elections. As pointed out by Mark Bowden and Matthew Teague, authors of new book The Steal: The Attempt to Overturn the 2020 Election and People Who Stopped It, Trump was ultimately stopped by “the integrity of hundreds of obscure Americans from every walk of life, state and local officials, judges and election workers. Many of them … Republicans, some … Trump supporters”. Nonetheless, at a rally near the White House on 6 January, Trump told such supporters to “fight like hell” in his cause. “And if you don’t fight like hell,” he said, “you’re not going to have a country anymore”. Five people died, including a rioter shot by law enforcement and a police officer. The Post poll found that 60% of Americans said Trump bore a “great deal” or a “good amount” of responsibility for the Capitol attack. However, 72% of Republicans and 83% of Trump voters said he bore “just some” responsibility or “none at all”. The Post reported: “A majority continue to say that violence against the government is never justified – but the 62% who hold that view is a new low point, and a stark difference from the 1990s, when as many as 90% said violence was never justified.” The paper interviewed some respondents. Phil Spampinato, 73, from Dover, Delaware, and a political independent, said he first “contemplated the question of whether violence against the government might be justified” as a way of “defending your way of life” after he saw Republicans changing state laws to restrict voting by Democrats and to make it easier to overturn results. “Not too many years ago,” Spampinato said, “I would have said that those conditions are not possible, and that no such violence is really ever appropriate.” Anthea Ward, a Republican 32-year-old mother of two from Michigan, said: “The world we live in now is scary. I don’t want to sound like a conspiracy theorist but sometimes it feels like a movie. It’s no longer a war against Democrats and Republicans. It’s a war between good and evil.” Ward said she did not approve of the Capitol attack. She also said she would not participate in violence over Covid-19 vaccine mandates – another social flashpoint. But, the Post reported, Ward did say other people could be justified in choosing to “express their second amendment right” if the government “infringe[d] their freedom of choice” over vaccines, “and nonviolent action such as protests were unsuccessful”.",News/US news,One in three Americans say violence against government justified – poll,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/02/one-three-americans-violence-government-justified-poll
1/2/2022,"According to Brazil’s 2010 census, 43% of citizens identify as mixed-race, while 30% of those who consider themselves white have black ancestors. Brazil has always wrestled with issues surrounding colourism and racial classification. Even affirmative action policies – such as race-based quotas at universities – have proved contentious. Paulo Scott explores these tensions in his latest novel, seamlessly translated by Daniel Hahn. Lourenço and Federico are from the same Porto Alegre family – their father is black, their mother white. Lourenço is dark-skinned, while Federico’s pale skin means he passes for white. Uncomfortable with the privilege this brings him, Federico works with disadvantaged black youth and dedicates his life to fighting racism. But guilt taints his close relationships and fuels his quick temper. Eventually he moves away, while his brother, a basketball coach, remains a popular figure in their neighbourhood.  Phenotypes opens in 2016, at the height of the quotas controversy. Some students have used their black ancestry to abuse the scheme, while other eligible students are deemed “insufficiently brown”. Federico has been asked to sit on a government commission in Brasília charged with limiting race fraud. Meanwhile, anti-government protests are spreading across the country and a family emergency calls him back to Porto Alegre. This is an artfully plotted tale about race, privilege and guilt. Scott circles around the inflammatory event that occurred decades before – a racist comment that provoked a violent fight among teenagers – and demonstrates how quickly prejudice spreads, often with lifelong repercussions. Years later, this incident is linked to the detention of Federico’s niece for the illegal possession of a firearm. Scott’s characterisation is superb. Federico’s complexities are revealed through his interactions with others, their different views of him, his public image and inner angst. His conflicted protagonist is flawed but hugely sympathetic. The stream-of-consciousness narrative, long sentences, paragraphs that run over pages and lack of speech tags are challenging, but careful reading proves richly rewarding. Phenotypes educates and entertains in equal measure. Phenotypes by Paulo Scott (translated by Daniel Hahn) is published by And Other Stories (£10).
