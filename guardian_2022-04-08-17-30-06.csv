4/8/2022,"Soaring metal prices mean it will cost more than the face value of the coins to make five cent, 10 cent and 20 cent pieces, according to new research. Prices of the two key metals in Australia’s silver coins, nickel and copper, have skyrocketed this year due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the price of nickel spiking 250% on the London Metals Exchange last month to more than US$100,000 a tonne. Investment bank Goldman Sachs predicts copper prices, which also spiked last month, are set to rise again as stocks of the metal run out. In research released this week, analysts at Morningstar said the metal in a five cent piece was now worth 6c, up from 4c six months ago. Over the same period, the value of metal in a 10 cent piece has increased from 9c to 14c, while metal making up a 20 cent piece has jumped in value to 28c from 18c. However, the 50 cent and higher denominations continue to have a higher face value than their metal content. There is 38c worth of metal in the dodecagonal coin today, against 25c six months ago, while the metal value of each of the $1 and $2 coin remains below 10c. The higher metal prices will eat into the Royal Australian Mint’s profit from making coins, which is known as seigniorage. Seigniorage returned to the commonwealth was $45.3m in the 2020-21 financial year, well above the Mint’s target of $19.9m – a result which the Mint said in its annual report was due to government financial support during the pandemic, “which saw an increase in the availability of cash within the economy and a corresponding demand for coin”. The impact of soaring metal prices on the Mint will not be immediate because it has a stockpile of metal. However, the Mint’s chief executive, Leigh Gordon, told Morningstar that the five cent piece was already costing more to produce than it generated in revenue and more coins could follow suit. “At the moment, we’re thinking, particularly the five, 10 and 20 cent pieces could be specific coins where we are not recovering the money that it’s costing us to make them,” he said.

It’s a nuisance and it costs 6c to make a five cent coin.” Morrison was unimpressed with the question. “Well Mal, if you can get as many people in this room again who are interested in that topic, I’ll answer your question,” he said. “I mean, I’ll take it up with the Reserve Bank governor, Mal. Why don’t we get some questions on the budget.”",News/Australia news,Time for a change?

4/8/2022,"In 1951, it emerged that the BBC planned to erect a 229-metre television transmitter at North Hessary Tor on Dartmoor. Lady Sylvia Sayer, chair of the Dartmoor Preservation Association, was incensed. It would, she wrote, be “landscape-slaughter on a more than usually impressive scale”. The “alien” presence would be “a perpetual reminder of that modern ‘civilisation’ which most people come to a national park to forget”. Despite Sayer’s forceful rhetoric, her campaign against the mast – her “first major foray into activist politics” – failed. But although she had lost one battle, the war to preserve the landscape of Dartmoor continued: “From her stone cottage in a tiny Dartmoor hamlet, she orchestrated frequent campaigns that combined her verbal eloquence, combativeness and grasp of legal statute and planning processes, placing her among the most effective post-war environmental campaigners and lobbyists.” Branded a “militant conservationist” by the press,Sayer fought on valiantly until her death in 2000. And yet today she is a little-known figure. Matthew Kelly’s book attempts to give her the recognition she deserves, along with three other women who campaigned to save the English countryside: Octavia Hill, Beatrix Potter and Pauline Dower. Their activism has helped shape the modern environmental consciousness, as well as preserving landscapes and access rights across the country. Some have argued that they were too successful. Since the 1970s when Kelly’s study ends, the loss of species and habitats has meant that the focus has increasingly turned to other threats, such as farming. The environmentalist George Monbiot has described the Lake District – the birthplace of the modern conservation movement – as a “sheepwrecked wasteland”. Upland landscapes have been reduced to monocultural green deserts. In the age of climate crisis, the talk is no longer of preservation but rewilding landscapes, as at the Knepp Estate in Sussex. And yet, as Kelly demonstrates, the achievements of these four preservationists deserve to be remembered and indeed celebrated. His book spans a century and he begins with Octavia Hill, “a moralist and reformer of quite astonishing range and commitment”. She believed the public should have right of access to open spaces, and after she helped found the National Trust in 1895, she worked tirelessly to raise money to buy plots of land to preserve views (“salient promontories”) for all to enjoy – especially in her beloved Kent. Beatrix Potter is, of course, famous for her children’s books. But she also became one of the National Trust’s most important benefactors. Like Hill, she believed in “purchasing to preserve”. She also believed in public access, though she “could be privately ungenerous about overweight women in unsuitable shoes”. When she died in 1943, she made what was the largest single Lake District bequest yet made to the Trust. The last of the four, Pauline Dower, was the longest serving and most senior woman on the National Parks Commission. All of them shared a commitment to traditional approaches to farming, such as upland grazing, but they were not nature conservationists: “They tended to express their concern about threats to the natural environment in terms of aesthetic or cultural rather than ecological loss.” Though they all had privileged upbringings, each had to confront gender stereotypes; being the only woman in the room “could be isolating but it also gave the four licence to challenge existing mores and assumptions”. As Kelly puts it: “No glass of whisky in the avuncular atmosphere of the club brought these women into line.” Kelly’s book is rich with insights into their motivations. Although at times the level of detail about land deals and committees makes for a rather dry read, an important part of Kelly’s argument is that the activism of these women involved precisely this kind of painstaking work to create and change legal structures, so that future generations could enjoy the rights they do today. As well as exploring their lives and activism, Kelly guides the reader through the landscapes that they fought to preserve. As he rightly says: “Each step we take today validates the work they did then.”  PD Smith is the author of City: A Guidebook for the Urban Age.

4/8/2022,"An Aboriginal sacred place located 65 metres from a land bridge used by Rio Tinto to haul iron ore is at least 50,000 years old, with new research finding evidence of occupation during the height of the last ice age. The mining giant, which funded the latest excavation, has promised to ensure the site “is preserved for future generations”. Archaeological exploration at the site, known as Yirra by the Yinhawangka traditional owners, has yielded stone tools, charcoal and bone which show a 50,000-plus year habitation, making it one of the oldest sites yet found in Australia. The research is the first traditional owner-led, non-mining related, heritage excavation on Yinhawangka country, and the first time Rio Tinto has participated in such exploration. The initiative is part of the company’s efforts to improve its relationships with traditional owner groups in the wake of the Juukan Gorge disaster, when the iron ore giant destroyed a 46,000 year old rock shelter against the consent of Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners. A subsequent 2021 federal parliamentary inquiry heard that archaeological work was usually perfunctory, and only done as part of a mining company’s application to destroy Aboriginal heritage sites under Western Australia’s previous heritage laws. Heritage experts told the inquiry that very few sites were studied in detail before the sign-off to destroy was given. The work at Yirra marks a significant departure from that practice. Yinhawangka people told the Juukan Gorge inquiry they were concerned for the integrity of Yirra, which was recorded in the WA heritage system but was not a registered site and therefore “unprotected”. The traditional owners said Yirra was very close to a “massive” (110-metre high) land bridge that haul pack trucks used to deliver ore from the mine pit. They said large boulders had rolled onto the site and there was significant soil erosion. Rio Tinto’s cultural heritage management plan did not provide for any actions relating to Yirra at that time, they said. Now there are calls for more work of this kind to be done. “We hope that Yirra will help us tell our ancestral story to Australia and our future generations. We would still be visiting this site if it wasn’t for the mining leases,” Yinhawangka Aboriginal corporation (YAC) chair Halloway Smirke said. “All Pilbara groups should have this kind of science work done on cultural sites. “Important sites like Yirra need to be protected, especially when they turn out to be amongst the oldest known places of human habitation in Australia,” Smirke said. YAC heritage manager, archeologist and anthropologist Dr Anna Fagan said the study was globally significant. “This was the first study of its kind to be done, not for mining compliance or heritage clearance, but for Yinhawangka People and Country. The Yirra findings help overturn and reset ideas of desert presence in Australia and I’m confident in global narratives,” Dr Fagan said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokesperson for Rio Tinto said the company acknowledged the significance of Yirra “and are committed to working in partnership with the Yinhawangka people” to preserve it. “We’ve undertaken a geotechnical study to further our understanding of the surrounds of the site and implemented additional controls,” the spokesperson said, without elaborating. YAC conducted the archaeological work in collaboration with Archae-aus heritage consultants, and researchers from the University of Western Australia. Archae-aus director Fiona Hook, who excavated the site with her husband, the late Dr Bruce Veitch, and traditional owners more than 20 years ago, said the importance of the site has now been proven beyond doubt. “When the old dates were returned, I was overwhelmed by emotion. I’ve worked with three generations of Yinhawangka People at this place. It is such an immense relief that we finally got to return to the site and excavate Yirra again after 20 years of waiting,” Hook said. Rio Tinto said it plans to fund further traditional owner-led cultural research and archaeological excavations. “This is a wonderful outcome for the Yinhawangka people and we welcome this incredible discovery,” Rio’s iron ore chief executive Simon Trott said. “These findings at Yirra are a major archaeological breakthrough of international significance, expanding knowledge of Aboriginal occupation in the Pilbara,” Trott said. Rio Tinto is in talks with other traditional owner groups in the Pilbara to fund further traditional owner-led cultural research and archaeological excavations, a spokesperson said.",News/Australia news,"WA Aboriginal site near Rio Tinto mine more than 50,000 years old, new study reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/08/wa-aboriginal-site-near-rio-tinto-mine-more-than-50000-years-old-new-study-reveals
4/8/2022,"John Lee, a career police officer turned hardline security official, is running unopposed to take over the top job in Hong Kong’s elections next month. As the sole candidate with Beijing’s blessing, he is all but guaranteed to become the next chief executive, according to local media reports. Lee announced his intention to run after stepping down on Wednesday from his post as chief secretary, the city’s second highest post, less than a year after he was promoted to the position from top security official. Carrie Lam, who currently holds the position, announced on Monday she would not be seeking a second term. Observers say Beijing’s apparent choice of Lee, who as the city’s top security official oversaw the government’s strong-handed response to the 2019 pro-democracy protests and the first year of its national security crackdown, is a sign the Chinese leadership is gearing the governance of the city towards a focus on national security above all else – including its economy and a housing crisis. John Burns, an emeritus professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong, said: “The central government selecting Lee as chief executive indicates Beijing’s continuing concern for security in Hong Kong … Apparently for Beijing security continues to be the number one priority.” Lee, 64, has spent his entire career in the disciplinary forces, joining the police force as an inspector in 1977, and later the government’s Security Bureau in 2012 as undersecretary of security. He rose to lead it in 2017. He holds a masters in public policy and administration from Charles Sturt University in Australia. Ivan Choy, a political science professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said: “We know that he comes from the disciplinary force. In the disciplinary force, we emphasise loyalty, discipline and implementation. And so I think we would expect that this may be a major element in the future governance of Hong Kong.” It was during Lee’s tenure as Hong Kong’s secretary of security that the city underwent the drastic changes under the national security law, which critics say has been used to imprison and silence all political opposition and dismantle its civil society. Like Lam, he was among the first Hong Kong and Chinese officials to be hit by US sanctions for his role in the ongoing crackdown on rights and liberties. This strict implementation of the national security law, observers say, is how Lee has proven his loyalty to Beijing. “He is a man with even better loyalty to Beijing,” Choy said, compared with Lam. Hongkongers have not had a direct say in who serves as their chief executive since the handover in 1997. Instead, the post is selected by a small committee of society stakeholders called the Election Committee. In March last year, Beijing overhauled the city’s electoral process, expanding the committee to 1,500 members but also tightening the criteria for candidates. New measures included a two-step national security screening process to ensure all members were loyal to the party. Lee played a key role in implementing the system that critics say guarantees Beijing’s chosen candidate gains the top job. As chief secretary, he led a seven-person panel tasked with vetting all candidates for the election committee and the legislative council to ensure they fulfil the vague criteria of “patriotism”. Under the new system, Hong Kong’s next chief executive election on 8 May will be picked by an election committee whose members have been vetted by a panel led by Lee. “I must point out to you that the democratic process of Hong Kong started after China resumed exercising sovereignty. No country has monopoly on the model of democracy,” Lee said in a speech as chief secretary at an online event to discuss Hong Kong issues to the UN human rights council in last month. Hong Kong’s previous chief executives have had to strike a balance between toeing Beijing’s red lines and ensuring the city’s place as an international financial centre. Lam had described it as a “dual accountability”. Lee’s background in the force and his penchant for executing orders may mean the balance under his leadership will tilt increasingly more towards Beijing. “I think certainly at the beginning it will incline more to Beijing’s political will,” Choy said.",News/World news,John Lee: the hardline security official leading race to become Hong Kong chief,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/john-lee-hong-kong-chief-security-police-officer-beijing
4/8/2022,"The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has defended his wife after revelations that she claims non-domiciled status, meaning she does not legally have to pay tax in the UK on her income earned abroad. The businesswoman Akshata Murty, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds, is an Indian citizen and is reported to hold a 0.91% stake in Infosys, an IT business founded by her father. Her share is thought to be worth £11.5m a year, meaning she may have avoided up to £20m in UK tax by being non-domiciled in the UK. Murty has said she pays tax overseas. Sunak told the Sun newspaper: “She loves her country like I love mine,” and said his wife had done nothing wrong in choosing a financial arrangement that legally exempted her from paying tax in Britain on foreign income. Asked whether he blamed Labour for what he called awful smears against his family, Sunak replied: “Yeah.” A report in the Times suggested unnamed allies of the chancellor had claimed the prime minister’s office were behind the leaks – an allegation No 10 and No 11 strongly denied. A Treasury source told the Guardian: “It is categorically not true that Rishi or anyone else in his team believe this is coming from No 10.” A No 10 spokesperson told PA Media: “It is categorically untrue that No 10 is behind the briefings. The prime minister and chancellor are united.” Sunak told the Sun that Murty was entitled to use the “non-dom” arrangement as she was an Indian citizen and planned to move back to her home country to care for her parents. On Wednesday, Murty claimed the non-dom status was given to her automatically as an Indian citizen. But tax experts have said she must choose to seek the status each year. Murty pays £30,000 a year for having non-domiciled status, her spokesperson confirmed. The status will automatically cease once she has resided in Britain for 15 years, with her due to reach that milestone in 2028. The chancellor said it was “unpleasant” to read attacks on his wife “especially when she hasn’t done anything wrong”. “She hasn’t broken any rules. She’s followed the letter of the law,” Sunak told the Sun. He said she “pays full UK tax on every penny that she earns here in the same way that she pays full international tax on every penny that she earns internationally”. He said he would never dream of asking his wife to give up Indian citizenship for the sake of his political career. He added: “I would hope that most fair-minded people would understand – though I appreciate that it is a confusing situation, that she is from another country.” He added: “These are her choices, right? She’s a private citizen, and of course I support my wife’s choices. She’s not her husband’s possession. Yes, he’s in politics, and we get that, but I think, you know, we get that she can be someone independent of her husband in her own right.” Labour hit back at claims it was responsible for the leak, with a party source telling PA Media: “The chancellor would do better to look a little closer to home. It’s clear that No 10 are the ones briefing against Rishi Sunak and, after his failure to tackle the cost of living crisis, you can understand why.” The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said on Thursday that Sunak could be guilty of “breathtaking hypocrisy” if his wife was reducing her own tax bill as the No 11 incumbent increased national insurance for millions of Britons. Murty confirmed her non-dom status after the Independent website first reported the arrangement on Wednesday – the day the 1.25-percentage-point rise in national insurance took effect. It means her permanent home is considered to be outside the UK despite the Sunaks living in Downing Street.",News/Politics,Akshata Murty: Sunak defends wife’s tax status as Labour and No 10 deny leak,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/08/akshata-murty-sunak-defends-tax-status-as-labour-and-no-10-deny-leak
4/8/2022,"The Cambo oilfield off the Shetland Islands could now be developed after a $1.5bn (£1.1bn) takeover of the owner of the controversial site. Siccar Point Energy, which put the project on “pause” when its partner Shell pulled out late last year after fierce opposition from environmental activists, has been acquired by Ithaca Energy. Ithaca Energy said Cambo and the nearby Rosebank sites are “two of the largest undeveloped and most strategically important discoveries in the UK North Sea”. Alan Bruce, the chief executive of Ithaca Energy, said: “The development of the Cambo and Rosebank fields is a huge opportunity to not only help secure the UK’s energy future for at least another quarter of a century, but also to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs in the process.” Shell pulled out of the development of the site in December saying the economic case for investment was “not strong enough”. However, last month a report claimed the energy company was reviewing its decision after the price of oil rocketed, making the project more financially viable. A spokeswoman for Shell, which still owns a 30% stake in Cambo, said it had nothing to add to its statement in December, when it pulled out of the project. The war in Ukraine has put a spotlight on the need for the UK to reduce its reliance on foreign energy sources, particularly from Russia. On Thursday the UK government released its energy strategy in full – trailed heavily the previous day – which included a new licensing round for oil and gas projects in the North Sea. The Cambo site has not yet received final approval from UK regulators. Ithaca Energy said: “The Cambo field on its own is anticipated to deliver up to 170m barrels of oil equivalent during its 25-year operational life, materially helping to reduce the need for the import of more carbon intensive alternatives and increasing the UK’s energy independence through the energy transition. “With a final investment decision expected on both fields next year, they represent a near-term opportunity to enhance the local and wider UK economy through the creation of a significant number of employment opportunities directly and across the supply chain.” The UK government said its commitment to more North Sea projects recognised “the importance of these fuels to the transition and to energy security”.",News/Business,Cambo oilfield development could be back on after takeover,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/08/cambo-oilfield-development-could-be-back-on-after-takeover
4/8/2022,"The House select committee investigating January 6 appears to believe the Capitol attack included a coordinated assault perpetrated by the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys militia groups that sought to physically stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election victory. The panel’s working theory – which has not been previously reported though the justice department has indicted some militia group leaders – crystallized this week after obtaining evidence of the coordination in testimony and non-public video, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Counsel on the select committee’s “gold team” examining Donald Trump, the “red team” examining January 6 rally organizers, and the “purple team” examining the militia groups, are now expected to use the findings to inform the direction for the remainder of the investigation, the sources said. The panel has amassed deep evidence about the connections between the connections between the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys in recent weeks after it obtained hours of non-public footage of the leaders of the militia groups in Washington ahead of the Capitol attack, the sources said. And the select committee has also now heard testimony from award-winning documentary film-maker Nick Quested on Wednesday about contacts between the militia group leaders, far-right political operatives and the Save America rally organizers, the sources said. The information, which could play a large role in establishing for the select committee whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy as part of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, is being viewed internally as a significant breakthrough, the sources added. Most crucially for the panel, it could form part of the evidence to connect the militia groups that stormed the Capitol on 6 January to the organizers of the Save America rally that immediately preceded the attack – who in turn are slowly being linked to the Trump White House. In essence, the sources said, the select committee now appears to have the same degree of evidence as secured by the FBI and the justice department referred to in recent prosecutions for seditious conspiracy and other charges related to the Capitol attack. A spokesperson for the panel declined to comment on witness testimony. The gold, red and purple teams have been focused on the video footage for several weeks, the sources said, with initial attention turned towards a now-infamous meeting between the militia group leaders in a parking garage near the Capitol on 5 January. But the select committee was unable to discern from the video whether the militia group leaders even discussed the Capitol or their plans for January 6 at that rendezvous, the sources said, and suspect the meeting was a set up to provide them an alibi. The panel has reviewed the tape repeatedly, the sources said, and House investigators have come away with an uneasy feeling that Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys, sought to have the meeting documented to later absolve himself of wrongdoing. Tarrio last week pleaded not guilty in a separate DoJ prosecution that accuses him of organizing the Capitol attack. The indictment states Tarrio on 4 January told other Proud Boy members: “I didn’t hear this voice note until now, you want to storm the Capitol.” The select committee has instead become more interested recently in communications both between the militia group leaders and the purported January 6 rally organizers, including Ali Alexander and far-right media personality Alex Jones, the sources said. That topic was one of the central lines of inquiry that the gold, red and purple teams attempted to establish during a seven-hour recorded interview with Quested, the source said. At that interview, the select committee also examined in excruciating minute-by-minute detail a 17-minute edited clip of footage shot by Quested that documented the Capitol attack, and video that tracked Alexander’s movements around the Capitol building, they said.",News/US news,Capitol attack investigators zero in on far-right Oath Keepers and Proud Boys,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/08/capitol-attack-january-6-proud-boys-oath-keepers
4/8/2022,"Camila Cabello’s smoky Latin-pop 2017 megahit, Havana, promised a pop star with some idiosyncrasies. Her two subsequent albums, however, hardly strayed from commercial pop-by-numbers; her music always felt like a supporting statement to her celebrity, most recently her breakup with pop heart-throb Shawn Mendes. Her third album, Familia, finally delivers that potential. Choosing to work with a smaller group of collaborators, she has leaned heavily into her Mexican-Cuban heritage, resulting in an album that’s honest and humming with artistic intent. The Willow Smith-assisted curio Psychofreak echoes Suzanne Vega’s Tom’s Diner and speaks to debilitating anxiety with a weariness that anyone who struggles with mental health issues will recognise. There’s also a recurring theme of self-sabotage and paranoia: “You’re not guilty, I’m hypervigilant,” she admits on the shuffling yet claustrophobic No Doubt, while the deceptive moonlight shimmer of Hasta los Dientes, sung entirely in Spanish, exposes someone gripped with self-doubt. The Latin elements are most vibrant. The mariachi-trill of La Buena Vida, featuring vocals from Cabello’s father, is telenovela-level melodramatic, and Lola, a haunting tale about sexism, poverty and corruption told over rumba rhythms, exhibits excellent storytelling.

4/8/2022,"The chair of the Russian aluminium company Rusal has called for an impartial investigation into the killing of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, which he described as a crime. In a rare public comment from a Russian firm on the conflict, Bernard Zonneveld, a Dutch national, did not say who was to blame for the deaths of civilians in the town, instead urging an end to the “fratricidal” conflict. Ukraine and several western governments have accused Moscow of war crimes after the bodies of civilians shot at close range, many of them with their hands tied, were found in Bucha after Russian forces withdrew. Mass graves containing 280 bodies were also found near the town after the initial discovery on Saturday of 20 bodies on the roadside. “All these people were shot,” Bucha’s mayor, Anatoly Fedoruk, has said. The Kremlin denies its forces were responsible for the deaths, claiming on Tuesday that western allegations that its forces had committed war crimes were a “monstrous forgery”. However, claims by the Kremlin that Ukrainian forces had placed bodies in the town in “staged provocation” were contradicted by satellite images showing bodies strewn in the streets in mid-March, when it was still held by Russian forces, in the same places they were seen in pictures published in early April.
