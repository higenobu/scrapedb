3/12/2022,"(This March. 9 story corrects paragraph 7 to make clear Russian embassy comment that citizens were receiving support directly from the government, not consular assistance) By Sultan Anshori KUTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - When Russian tourist Konstantin Ivanov tried to withdraw money from his home bank account at a cash machine on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, the transaction was blocked. Unprecedented sanctions against Russia's banks over its invasion of Ukraine are taking a toll on its citizens overseas, who have been left scrambling to find cash or turn to crypto transactions to get by. ""This has created a huge problem for us. We have been left completely stripped of our finances - it's like they have been completely frozen and we cannot use them at all over here,"" said Ivanov, 27, adding that he might have to look for a job in Indonesia. Bali is a popular holiday destination with Russian tourists, who flocked to the island by the tens of thousands before the pandemic and were among the first to return when borders partially reopened last year. About 1,150 Russians entered Indonesia in January 2022, according to data from the statistics bureau. Rifki Saldi Yanto, the manager of a local cafe, said he had noticed a decline in Russian customers in recent days and many now pay with cash instead of credit card. Russia's embassy in Jakarta said there was ""support from the government directly"". Denis Tetiushin, an embassy spokesperson, said Russia's Pochta Bank was now offering a virtual card using China's UnionPay system instead of Visa or Mastercard. ""It's free of charge and people may open it wherever they are,"" he said in a text message. Meanwhile more than 7,000 Russians were stranded in Thailand, another popular beach destination because of flight cancellations, a rouble currency in free-fall and payment issues. [L3N2VB1KZ] Russia's economy is facing its gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, after western countries moved in recent days to isolate it from the global financial system. International payments system SWIFT has disconnected several Russian banks from its network, while Visa and Mastercard said they were blocking overseas use of their cards issued by Russian banks from March 9.

3/12/2022,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine president is ready to open the country’s “facilities” to American forces under a 1951 mutual defense treaty if Russia's war against Ukraine turns for the worse and embroils the United States in the fighting, Manila’s ambassador to Washington said Thursday. Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez said President Rodrigo Duterte made the remarks in a recent meeting in Manila where the president also expressed concern over the global economic impact of the unfolding crisis. The Philippines has condemned the invasion and voted yes on a U.N. General Assembly resolution that demanded an immediate halt to Moscow’s attack and the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukraine. Duterte, whose stormy six-year term ends in June, has nurtured closer ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping while often criticizing U.S. security policies in the first years of his presidency. But Romualdez said Duterte told him that that the Russian invasion was wrong. “He says if they’re asking for the support of the Philippines, it’s very clear that, of course, if push comes to shove, the Philippines will be ready to be part of the effort, especially if this Ukrainian crisis spills over to the Asian region,” Romualdez said in an online briefing with Manila-based journalists. “Give them the assurance that if ever needed, the Philippines is ready to offer whatever facilities or whatever things that the United States will need being a major — our number one ally.” Duterte did not specify in his remarks which Philippine facilities American forces would gain access to, but Romualdez said these could include the sprawling Clark and Subic Bay freeports northwest of Manila that used to be among the largest American air and naval bases outside the U.S. mainland until U.S. forces withdrew from them in the early 1990s. There was no immediate comment from Duterte or his office. The 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty commits the United States and the Philippines to come to the aid of the other in case of an attack. American officials have repeatedly assured their Philippine counterparts in recent years that they would honor their treaty obligations if Filipino forces, ships or aircraft come under attack in the disputed South China Sea, including by China. U.S. national security officials have scheduled a meeting at the White House with ambassadors of the Association of Southeast Asian nations this week to discuss the widening sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Russia, including President Joe Biden’s ban on Russian oil imports, Romualdez said. Romualdez also said he learned that Ukraine has appealed to many nations, including the Philippines, “to stop doing business with Russia” but said he was unaware if the request has been officially conveyed to Manila. Another topic at the meeting with U.S. officials this week is Biden’s invitation to ASEAN heads of state to take part in a special U.S. summit on March 28. The 76-year-old Duterte may skip the event because it falls on his birthday and also because it will occur during the busy Philippine elections season, Romualdez said.",World/Associated Press,Philippines ready to back US if it gets embroiled in war,https://news.yahoo.com/philippines-ready-back-us-gets-053343337.html
3/12/2022,"By Omer Berberoglu KYIV (Reuters) -Kyiv mayor and former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko told Reuters on Friday that he believed there were nearly 2 million people still left in the city, which is being squeezed by advancing Russian forces on several fronts. He said that the Ukrainian capital, normally home to some 3.5 million people, had enough vital supplies to last a couple of weeks, and that supply lines in and out remained open for now. His brother Wladimir, also a heavyweight boxing star, added in the joint interview that some of the men and women who had accompanied their families to the relative safety of the west of the country were returning to take part in the city's defence. ""We guess close to 2 million people are still in Kyiv and it's very important to give services to people,"" Vitali told Reuters in the centre of Kyiv. ""We have right now electricity, heating, gas, we have water,"" he added, speaking in English. He thanked countries for sending supplies to Ukraine, and estimated that Kyiv had enough vital goods to last another two weeks, although supply lines did remain open. Russian forces are already close to Kyiv to the west and northwest, where there has been heavy fighting with Ukrainian troops, and have moved closer to the east and northeast. Ukrainian officials say that their ultimate aim is to surround the city with a view to seizing it. Hundreds of thousands of residents have fled to the relative safety of the west of Ukraine as the fighting neared the outskirts of Kyiv, joining millions of others forced to leave homes behind by sometimes fierce bombardment. Wladimir Klitschko, who enlisted in Ukraine's reserve army earlier this month, added that some of the men and women who travelled west with their families were now returning. ""Yes there are a lot of refugees who left west, but a lot are coming back. A lot of men and women ... coming back to defend the country. This is our home. We are staying here. We are not leaving anywhere,"" he said. Across Ukraine, thousands of civilians have joined local defence units to support regular troops. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""de-Nazify"" the country. It denies targeting civilians. Ukraine and its allies accuse Moscow of an unjustified invasion that has caused a humanitarian catastrophe in which hundreds of civilians have been killed and millions more displaced.

3/12/2022,"STORY: As fighting rages in Ukraine, western countries look set to ramp up action against Russia’s economy. The U.S. and EU, together with G7 countries, plan to strip Russia of its “most favored nation” status. That's according to multiple Reuters sources. The EU said last week that it was looking at what it could do within the context of the World Trade Organization. Though it sounds technical, stripping Russia of the status would open the way to stiff new tariffs and quotas on its exports. In 2020, the EU imported over $105 billion of goods from the country. That was mostly oil and gas, but also included large quantities of farm produce, raw materials, chemicals, iron and steel. In the U.S., removing Russia’s “Permanent Normal Trade Relations” status would require an act of Congress. However, officials say lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have already indicated their support for such a move. WTO rules normally require all countries to be treated equally. But it looks like Russia is about to lose that privilege.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Russia to lose 'most favored nation' trade status,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-lose-most-favored-nation-114334395.html
