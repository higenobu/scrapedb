4/2/2022,"England were handed a favourable draw for the 2022 World Cup as they were paired with United States and Iran. Scotland or Wales will join them in Group B if they qualify through the playoffs. Gareth Southgate’s side will face Iran – whom they have never met at senior level – in their first match on 21 November before another World Cup meeting with the USA on 25 November. Their final match on 29 November will be against the qualifiers from the remaining European spot that is still to be determined, with Scotland and Wales in contention with Ukraine. Scotland’s playoff was originally scheduled for 24 March but was postponed last month after Russia invaded Ukraine. The tie is due to take place in June, with the winners facing Wales in Cardiff. The winners Group B could face France in the quarter-finals after the world champions were drawn in Group D with Denmark, Tunisia and the winners of the playoff between Peru and the United Arab Emirates or Australia. Qatar were handed a difficult group that includes the -Netherlands, the African champions Senegal and Ecuador, whom the hosts will meet in the opening match on 21 -November. That will take place at the Al Bayt Stadium, 35 kilometres from the capital, Doha, with precise venues for all other fixtures to be determined. Elsewhere, the 2010 winners, Spain, were paired with the 2014 winners, Germany, in Group E along with Japan and the winners of the playoff between Costa Rica and New Zealand, while the five-time winners Brazil will be in Group G with Switzerland and Serbia, having been drawn with both countries in 2018. Group A: Qatar, Ecuador, Netherlands, Senegal Group B: England, Iran, USA, Scotland/Wales/Ukraine Group C: Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Poland Group D: France, UAE/Australia/Peru, Denmark, Tunisia Group E: Spain, Costa Rica/New Zealand, Germany, Japan Group F: Belgium, Canada, Morocco, Croatia Group G: Brazil, Serbia, Switzerland, Cameroon Group H: Portugal, Ghana, Uruguay, South Korea The draw – presented by Idris Elba, Reshmin Chowdhury and Jermaine Jenas – opened with a message in Arabic from the Egyptian actor Sherihan. “We welcome the entire world with open arms,” she said. Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, said: “This World Cup will simply be the best World Cup ever, the greatest show on Earth. The world will be united in Qatar.” This will be the first World Cup hosted by an Arab or Muslim country, although the decision to award the tournament to Qatar in December 2010 has been heavily criticised since over human rights concerns. England drew 1-1 with the USA in their opening match at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and will face Gregg Berhalter’s side in their second match. England have enjoyed favourable draws in recent tournaments but ended up second behind Belgium in their group in Russia four years ago after beating Tunisia and Panama in their first two matches.

4/2/2022,"The late supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is to be honoured by having a US navy ship named after her. The yet-to-be-built USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg fuel tanker will join a fleet of John Lewis-class “replenishment oilers” named for historical figures in US movements for human and civil rights. The navy took delivery last summer of the first of the fleet, itself named for Lewis, the former Democratic congressman from Georgia who died aged 80 in 2020. Other ships are due to be named for Harvey Milk, Earl Warren, Robert F Kennedy, Lucy Stone, Sojourner Truth and Thurgood Marshall. Announcing the move to honour Ginsburg, who died aged 87 in 2020 after 27 years on the supreme court, the navy secretary, Carlos Del Toro, noted the justice’s advocacy for women’s rights and gender equality. “She is instrumental to why we now have women of all backgrounds, experiences and talents serving within our ranks, side by side with their male sailor and marine counterparts,” Del Toro said in a statement. “As secretary of the navy, it is my aim to ensure equality and eliminate gender discrimination across the Department of the Navy.” The statement also noted that Ginsburg issued the majority opinion in a landmark 1996 ruling that struck down the male-only admissions policy at the Virginia military institute. No expected launch date for the USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg was given. It was also announced this week that items associated with Ginsburg including an example of the distinctive collars she wore over her supreme court robes will be donated to the Smithsonian Institution. In Congress, a bill to commission statues of Ginsburg and Sandra Day O’Connor, the first woman to sit on the supreme court, passed the House on Monday.",News/US news,Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be honoured with US navy ship named after her,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/01/ruth-bader-ginsburg-us-navy-ship-named-for-her
4/2/2022,"In 1972, a researcher in a small city at the bottom of New Zealand set out to track the development of more than 1,000 newborn babies and their health and behaviour at age three, not realising then that over the next 50 years, the research would morph into one of the world’s most important longitudinal studies. The study did not stop at three years, instead it gathered pace, following the lives of the participants from birth into adulthood, and creating a comprehensive body of data that has yielded more than 1,300 peer-reviewed research papers, reports and books. This week marks the 50th anniversary of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Research Study, more commonly known as “the Dunedin study”. The study has some limitations from a domestic perspective – the cohort is reflective of 1970s Dunedin and not the more ethnically diverse New Zealand of 2022 - but it does capture a group of people who have grown up in all sorts of households. Founded by Dr Phil A. Silva in 1972, and now under the directorship of professor Richie Poulton, the study continues with just under 1,000 members, who remain completely anonymous to everyone except the researchers, and all of whom turn 50 over the next year. Every few years, since the members were born, they have returned to the University of Otago research centre, in Dunedin, flying in from all over the world to spend a few days having their mental and physical health thoroughly examined. Everything from dental to cardiovascular health, from sexual behaviour to relationships and lifestyle are covered. “It’s incredibly important that we acknowledge the real heroes of the study, which are the study members. They only do it for one main reason, which is, they think it might help other people,” says Poulton, who joined the team in 1985. At that stage, the study members were becoming teenagers and the work led by Prof Terrie Moffittwould evolve into a paper on antisocial behaviour in adolescents – a body of research that has become the most cited theory in criminology. Speaking from her home in North Carolina, Moffitt says: “So many countries use that 1993 paper as a justification for reforming their juvenile justice system to be less punitive and more supportive to young offenders.” The data has also helped show that child maltreatment can lead to systematically higher levels of body-wide inflammation and an elevated risk of depression, Poulton says. “Inflammation is a marker of risk for all sorts of other physical diseases.” “Children exposed to adverse psychosocial experiences have enduring emotional, immune, and metabolic abnormalities that contribute to explaining their elevated risk for age-related disease,” the paper reads. As the years evolved, so too did the expertise the researchers needed to keep up with their members’ new life stages. “When they were teenagers, it was drugs and alcohol and risky sex and law breaking – we had to become an experts in that but then they grew out of it. Then we had to become expert in how they pick a partner, how they decide to have children and when to have their first baby. Now that they’re going to be in their 50s, we’re studying how they’re preparing for old age,” Moffitt, who is still an associate director, says. The research will also shift to reflect changes in society – including delving into the thorny area of social cohesion, or, what makes communities and societies stick together, and why, all over the globe, they are becoming unstuck. “We thought, well, hold on, we’ve got a whole bunch of information on just about everything but we haven’t got a good measure of social cohesion yet,” Poulton says. With that in mind, the team will now develop a method for understanding what underpins socially cohesive behaviour. In a stroke of fortunate timing, the last assessment was taken in 2019 – just before the pandemic hit. But not wanting to miss an opportunity, the team contacted the members in 2021, to interview them about their experience of the pandemic and their plans for getting the vaccine, with that data due to be released soon, Moffitt says. There are three things that set the Dunedin study apart from longer running studies overseas, Poulton says: a high retention rate (94% of the original cohort have stayed), a multidisciplinary approach that gathers an “incredible” breadth of information, and testing and interviewing people face-to-face rather than through questionnaires. “That’s a very rare combo – the Holy Trinity in my mind – to make us the best study of our type in the world.”",News/World news,"The Dunedin study at 50: landmark experiment tracked 1,000 people from birth",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/the-dunedin-study-at-50-landmark-experiment-tracked-1000-people-from-birth
4/2/2022,"Wintry weather is set to continue this weekend, with further snow and sleet forecast across the east of the UK, after a light dusting fell in south-east England on Friday morning. Temperatures will stay low on Friday evening, plunging to -1C (30F) in northern Scotland and the east Midlands by early morning on Saturday, resulting in widespread frost. There will be rain and sleet in the west that will keep temperatures slightly warmer, and some hill snow over Wales, possibly also landing in lower altitudes. The Met Office warned of potential travel disruption from ice on Saturday due to snow and hail showers in the north-east and east of England, stretching from the border with Scotland down to the east Midlands. Although temperatures will be low for the time of year, much of the UK will see sunny spells on Saturday. Winds shifting north-west will bring milder air, meaning temperatures should recover on Monday and come closer to the averages for this time of year, with highs of 14C in the south of England. These will give way to a second blast of air coming down from the Arctic that could result in snow returning next week, said the meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey. “When precipitation falls into some of the colder air ahead of it, that causes more wintry stuff to develop, but it won’t be as dramatic a plunge as we’ve seen just gone,” he said. The cold end to March and start of April comes after Britain experienced its sunniest March in almost a century, according to forecasters. Scotland and Northern Ireland saw the most sun in March since records began, while the UK as a whole recorded the sunniest March since 1929, the Met Office said. Northern Ireland basked in 90% more sunshine than average for the month, with a total of 192.5 hours of sun. Scotland saw 64% more than usual, with a total of 160.1 hours. The sunny outlook was replicated across the UK, with England seeing its second sunniest March, at 168.1 hours, and Wales its fifth sunniest, with 157.9 hours. The Met Office began recording sunshine hours in 1919. Dr Mark McCarthy, the head of the forecaster’s national climate information centre, which manages the UK’s climate records, said large areas of high pressure that settled over the UK for much of the month caused the record-breaking figures. He said: “March has again illustrated the typical variability of the UK’s climate, with some cold conditions at the start and end of the month separated by a long spell of mild and settled weather. “The record-breaking sunshine figures were largely brought on by a very large area of high pressure that sat over the UK for much of the month, at times also covering much of Europe. This brought clear skies, mild days, but also some cool nights and some frosts. “We’ve seen the warmest weather of the year so far with 20.8C recorded in London on 23 March, but we also saw a low of minus 9.1C at Aboyne (Aberdeenshire) at the start of the month, highlighting the variability of March in the UK.”",News/UK news,Snow and sleet forecast for east of UK in weekend of wintry weather,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/01/snow-and-sleet-forecast-for-east-of-uk-in-weekend-of-wintry-weather
4/2/2022,"The government is worried about the controversy surrounding the Ricketts family’s bid to buy Chelsea and does not want a group unpopular with supporters to purchase the club. The owners of the Chicago Cubs have seen their campaign rocked by accusations of bigotry and their efforts to turn public opinion in their favour are yet to bear fruit. A #notoricketts campaign has been trending on Twitter and Chelsea fans will stage protests against the Ricketts when Thomas Tuchel’s side meet Brentford at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Opposition to the bid began after it emerged that Joe Ricketts, the family’s patriarch, was accused of Islamophobia three years ago. Problematic comments attributed to other family members have also been criticised and the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust has expressed doubts about the Ricketts on diversity grounds. Those comments have been noted in Westminster circles, where there is a desire for the sale of Chelsea to run smoothly. One issue for the government is that the sale has been forced by its decision to impose sanctions on Roman Abramovich after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The government knows it could face criticism if Chelsea’s next owners prove controversial and it is understood to be uneasy about the negativity around the Ricketts, one of four shortlisted groups set to submit improved offers before the 11 April deadline. It remains to be seen how much the government will seek to influence the process. It is highly unlikely to use its power of veto if the Raine Group, the US bank handling the sale, and Chelsea identify the Ricketts as their preferred bidders. A more plausible scenario is that the government will express its concerns in private to Raine and Chelsea. The backlash has not deterred the Ricketts. They have heavy financial clout after partnering with the billionaire hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin, have appointed the US investment bank Jefferies in an advisory capacity and believe their sporting background would give them an edge at Chelsea. They can point to their renovation of Chicago’s Wrigley Field stadium as evidence they would be capable of redeveloping Stamford Bridge. Yet many Chelsea fans remain unconvinced, even though Joe Ricketts is not part of the bid and the family has said it “rejects any form of hate in the strongest possible terms”. Efforts to improve the family’s image by Tom Ricketts, who is fronting the bid and has distanced himself from his father’s past comments, have had little effect. There was more controversy after it emerged that Raine facilitated a meeting between Tom Ricketts and Paul Canoville, Chelsea’s first black footballer, at Stamford Bridge last week. The meeting went down badly with rival bidders, who fear that the Ricketts are receiving favourable treatment from Raine and Chelsea. That drew an angry response from Chelsea fans and led to plans for demonstrations at the Brentford game. The backlash has surprised the Ricketts. A source close to the bid questioned whether there was a campaign of misinformation against the family and said their behaviour had been above board. It was also pointed out that the family have met with fans and stakeholder groups to offer reassurances, with further meetings are planned.",Sport/Football,Ricketts family’s controversial bid for Chelsea prompts government concern,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/01/ricketts-familys-controversial-bid-for-chelsea-prompts-government-concern
4/2/2022,"The trans woman cyclist Emily Bridges has broken her silence to attack cycling’s governing body, the UCI, and the media after she was excluded from the women’s section of the British National Omnium Championships on Saturday. The 21-year-old, who set a national junior men’s record over 25 miles in 2018, had been due to compete against several British Olympians, including Dame Laura Kenny, in her first race in the women’s category. However on Wednesday night the UCI ruled Bridges was ineligible as she was still registered as a male cyclist. Its decision came after several riders held talks about boycotting the event in protest as they felt Bridges had an unfair advantage. In a statement published on Friday, Bridges insisted that she had been in contact with British Cycling and the UCI for the last six months – and was therefore surprised she had been barred. “I have provided both British Cycling and the UCI with medical evidence that I meet the eligibility criteria for transgender female cyclists, including that my testosterone limit has been far below the limit prescribed by the regulations for the last 12 months,” Bridges said. “Despite the public announcement, I still have little clarity around their finding of my ineligibility under their regulations. “I am an athlete, and I just want to race competitively again. No one should have to choose between being who they are, and participating in the sport that they love.” Bridges also claimed that she had been “relentlessly harassed and demonised” by the media, who she said had written stories about her to boost their web traffic. “They attack anything that isn’t the norm and print whatever is most likely to result in the highest engagement for their articles, and bring in advertising,” she added. “This is without care for the wellbeing of individuals or marginalised groups, and others are left to pick up the pieces due to their actions. My privacy has been totally violated over speculation around my eligibility and fairness to compete.”",Sport/Sport,Excluded trans cyclist Emily Bridges says she meets criteria to compete,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/01/excluded-trans-cyclist-emily-bridges-says-she-meets-criteria-to-compete
4/2/2022,"However faint the hope may be, any glimmer of peace – or even a brief respite – is welcome in the face of a brutal war that has claimed so many civilian lives, seen atrocities by all parties, and displaced 2 million people from their homes. “Nowhere on Earth”, even in Ukraine, are people more at risk than in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, the head of the World Health Organization said this month. Yet as Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, himself from Tigray, noted, the conflict is happening “out of sight and out of mind”. Up to half a million are estimated to have died from war and famine since the conflict broke out in late 2020. More than 90% of the region’s population is in urgent need of assistance, the United Nations warns. Remaining food stocks from the last harvest – only half the usual yield – will soon be exhausted. What the UN calls a de facto government blockade has halted road deliveries and left the population dependent on scarcer and much more expensive air shipments; the UN recently said it had reached only 7,000 of the 870,000 people it was trying to help weekly. Last week, the federal government declared an immediate humanitarian truce to allow the delivery of aid. Tigrayan officials have said that they are observing it, as long as sufficient aid arrives within a “reasonable” time. The first trucks for more than 100 days arrived on Friday afternoon, but suspicion remains that the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, may seek to assuage the concerns of Ethiopia’s international donors by allowing a nominal amount through, rather than the 100 trucks a day estimated to be necessary. And Tigray needs not just food and medicine, but seeds for the planting season, which begins in weeks, as well as the restoration of banking, trade, telecommunications and fuel. The Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) accuses the federal government and officials in the Afar region of holding up the trucks, while the federal government says it is Tigrayan troops that have blocked the road as part of a surge in fighting, which TPLF and Afar forces blame on each other and which imperils the hopes of peace. The war began in November 2020, when Mr Abiy said he was launching a strike on the TPLF because it had attacked an army base, following a political dispute in which the federal government and regional Tigray government declared each other illegitimate. But the swift victory he expected appears as distant as ever. A brief ceasefire last summer was followed by an intensification of the conflict. This break in the fighting looks slightly more promising. But it is unclear whether the government even has a plan for establishing a substantive peace process, let alone whether either side is willing to make the kind of concessions necessary to reach a deal. To reconcile with the TPLF would jeopardise relations with Isaias Afwerki’s regime in Eritrea, which has aided Mr Abiy’s troops. It also risks catalysing opposition to him in Amhara, which is angered by its occupation by Tigrayan forces last year, and which is occupying western Tigray. Many in Ethiopia fear the TPLF’s return to the political dominance it enjoyed for decades, and point out that the prime minister won elections last year by a landslide. Others say a power grab by Mr Abiy triggered the crisis. Many Tigrayans have come to see the conflict as a matter of survival; some think that secession may be their best hope. The alternative to peace is not only severe civilian suffering but further destabilisation of the country, and potentially of the region. But the urgent issue is preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths from famine. If the current truce can deliver even that limited aim, it will be a step forward.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Ethiopia’s war: a glimpse of hope | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/01/the-guardian-view-on-ethiopias-war-there-must-be-hope
4/2/2022,"Prince Andrew is facing calls to explain why he received £1m in payments linked to a financier who is now facing allegations of fraud in the high court. The Duke of York, who is already embroiled in controversy after settling a US sexual assault case for up to £12m, is named alongside his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, in a ruling on a dispute between a Turkish woman and businessman. In 2019, Andrew received £750,000 from Nebahat Isbilen, a Turkish millionaire and wife of a former leading politician, who has claimed in the high court that she was told by her financial adviser Selman Turk to pay the sum to the prince in return for assistance with a passport application. Turk was the founder and chief executive of Heyman AI, a digital challenger bank which, nine days before the payment, received an award from Andrew at a Pitch@Palace event – a Dragons’ Den-style project for entrepreneurs created by the duke. Isbilen’s court case against Andrew has led to the uncovering of further payments of up to £350,000 to the duke from a company called Alphabet, described by solicitors as “a fraudulent and covert front” to make payments to those “associated” with Turk. Ferguson also received payments of at least £225,000 from Turk via Alphabet Capital, said to be in connection with payment she was owed for her work with a solar power company. There is no suggestion in the court documents of any wrongdoing by the prince or Ferguson. Andrew declined to comment while Ferguson’s spokesperson said she had been unaware of the allegations against Turk. Andrew repaid the £750,000 roughly 16 months after he received it and it remains unclear whether he was aware of the money entering his personal bank account, or what it was for. Graham Smith, the chief executive of Republic, which calls for the dissolution of the monarchy, said Andrew should be clear about why he thought the money had been paid to him. “Quite clearly it raises a lot of questions about what was going on, what the relationship was between this person at Pitch@Palace and Andrew,” he said. “It’s not credible he had no knowledge of it and wasn’t aware it was paid in. So why didn’t he immediately raise questions and pay it back? He needs to be completely clear and honest about exactly what was going on.” Pitch@Palace involved entrepreneurs presenting pitches lasting no more than three minutes to a room at St James’s Palace filled with “CEOs, influencers, angels, mentors and business partners”. In 2019, Turk’s company, Heyman AI, won the people’s choice award, which is voted for by the audience. The company went bust about 18 months later. In her witness statement to the court, translated from Turkish and seen by the Guardian, Isbilen, 77, said Turk invited her to the event and she attended. “I can only wonder if there is any connection between this event and the Duke of York transfer,” she states. A “particulars of claim” document for the case against Turk, seen by the Guardian, says: “In or around November 2019, Mr Turk told Mrs Isbilen that she needed to make a purported ‘gift’ of £750,000 to HRH Duke of York by way of payment for assistance that he told her HRH Duke of York had provided in relation to Mrs Isbilen’s Turkish passport.” The document claims the passport suggestion was a ruse. It continues: “The representation that Mrs Isbilen needed to make a gift to HRH Duke of York in connection with her passport (or for any other purpose) was false, and Mr Turk made it dishonestly, knowing it to be false and intending Mrs Isbilen to rely on it.’ In the ruling, Judge Halpern QC said a lawyer representing Isbilen had said, in an affidavit, that information had emerged to show evidence given by Turk was “misleading”. He said the solicitor, Jonathan Tickner, had told him how evidence showed that “money was used for purposes unconnected with Mrs Isbilen, eg substantial sums were paid to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and to Sarah, Duchess of York”. The claim is part of a wider ongoing case against Turk, and various businesses associated with him, in the high court for the return of an estimated £40m. Isbilen said she had trusted Turk as her financial adviser. She claimed she was fleeing political persecution in Turkey. Her husband, the former deputy leader of the ruling AK party, was imprisoned in 2015 after an attempted coup in Turkey. Ferguson’s case is she received the funds from Turk’s business after he took on a debt owed to her by Pegasus, a solar power company, which owed her payment for her role as ambassador for the firm. Her spokesperson said: “The duchess was completely unaware of the allegations that have since emerged against Mr Turk. She is naturally concerned by what has been alleged against him.” A spokesperson for Andrew said: “We are unable to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.” The Guardian has approached Turk for comment. Another court document, dated April 2021, says Turk disputes Isbilen’s allegations: “He disagrees with her portrayal of the facts, including as to her understanding of the various dealings with her assets. He states that much of what has happened is the result of Mrs Isbilen’s status as a politically exposed person and the consequential difficulty in dealing with her assets.” The revelations come after the prince settled a sex assault case filed against him by Virginia Giuffre for an undisclosed sum, reported to be as much as £12m. The out-of-court settlement in the US civil case means the prince makes no admission of guilt over claims by Giuffre that he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17, allegations he has repeatedly denied. On Tuesday, Andrew made his public appearance since the settlement, alongside his mother the Queen at a memorial service for his father, Prince Philip.",News/UK news,Prince Andrew facing calls to explain £1m payments linked to high court fraud case,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/01/prince-andrew-facing-calls-to-explain-1m-payments-linked-to-high-court-case
4/2/2022,"Robin Dunbar’s article (The big idea: do we still need religion?, 28 March) outlines the scientifically measurable benefits of religion. After two years of the pandemic, when our collective physical health has been prioritised, it is now time to focus on these benefits to our spiritual health. Though Dunbar states that religion is not going anywhere, most congregations have been shrinking for decades. Most churches in Britain today would be flabbergasted if 150 people turned up on Sundays. In order to offer community that works for most people, churches must evolve. The benefits of religion that Dunbar explains – community cohesion, greater trust, greater happiness – will be vital as we crawl out of the pandemic, and if we are to navigate the climate crisis. Evolution is part of the DNA of Unitarian churches, which are open to wisdom from all sources, and practise free inquiry into faith and belief, rather than all conforming to a single doctrine. Religion is here to stay – but we must adapt it to what is needed and what works for us right now. Unitarians don’t have that finished version yet – but anyone joining us can be part of creating it.Liz SladeChief officer, General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches  Robin Dunbar’s article is a terrific analysis of the perks of religion, but misses its core: the bathwater is described in detail, while the baby is nowhere. Yes, it’s good to know that the rituals release endorphins, that “religious people” are happier, healthier and live longer, and that the “community cohesion” of a faith group leads to social bonding, and thus to survival. So, great. Join a community choir. At the heart of faith is the longing to know the unknowable and endlessly mysterious infinite often called God. Yes, church is important, but more important for me is prayer, often alone and silent. Quakers call it waiting on God or listening for the inner voice, but it doesn’t really matter what you call it. The certainty that it’s not all about me or us, that there is something more, something transcendent that occasionally is glimpsed and transforms everything – that is the reason faith survives.Joanna HodgkinLondon  Do we still need religion?

4/2/2022,"I can offer a little insight into how Mary Whitehouse operated (TV review, 29 March). In the 1960s I was in the enviable position of producer of BBC Two classic serials. We produced a wide range of dramatisations of international novels including Émile Zola’s Nana. Its content was without doubt controversial, but it was nonetheless regarded as a great work and worthy of dramatising. It certainly involved sexual attitudes and included bare breasts. Mrs Whitehouse reacted with a furious letter of condemnation, describing me with the words to the effect that I was a foul, depraved wretch who should be banned from television. She, of course, was entitled to her opinion. However, she seemed to have forgotten that the immediately preceding novel I had produced was George Eliot’s Middlemarch, after which she had written to me wishing there were more producers like me working at the BBC. Needless to say, she copied the Nana letter to the director general, but not the Middlemarch one.David ConroyLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
