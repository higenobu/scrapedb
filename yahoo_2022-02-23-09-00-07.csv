2/23/2022,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge signaled on Tuesday he may not let Donald Trump countersue E. Jean Carroll, a writer who accused the former president of raping her in the mid-1990s and is suing him for defamation. At a hearing in Manhattan, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan suggested it might be futile for Trump to claim that Carroll's lawsuit violated a New York ""anti-SLAPP"" law protecting free speech, citing several courts that found similar laws did not apply in federal court. ""I question whether you have the right to do what you are seeking to do, because it seems to me it's entirely inconsistent with the notion of futility,"" Kaplan told Trump's lawyer Alina Habba. ""It may not be the way I resolve this matter."" Carroll, a former Elle magazine columnist, accused Trump in a June 2019 book excerpt of having raped her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Midtown Manhattan. She sued five months later, claiming that Trump defamed her when he told a reporter he did not know Carroll, said ""she's not my type,"" and accused her of concocting the rape claim to sell her book. New York's anti-SLAPP law, short for ""strategic lawsuits against public participation,"" was enacted in Nov. 2020. It was meant to protect journalists and others from wealthy companies and people who file frivolous lawsuits to silence critics. How the law might apply to public officials, or former public officials like Trump, remains unclear. Kaplan questioned why Trump waited until January, 14 months after New York's law took effect, to invoke it, which Carroll's lawyers said reflected Trump's pattern of delaying the case. ""This is about giving us the right to litigate these issues,"" Habba said. ""That is all I'm asking."" Kaplan did not say when he will rule. Both sides are awaiting a decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on whether Carroll's lawsuit should be dismissed because Trump was immune from being sued. In that appeal, the Biden administration essentially adopted an argument by Trump's Justice Department that the government should be substituted for Trump as the defendant, which could doom Carroll's case. Carroll's lawyers want to question Trump under oath and compare his DNA with a dress Carroll said she wore during the alleged rape. The case is Carroll v Trump, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-07311.

2/23/2022,"
 Former President Trump on Tuesday called Russia's recognition of two breakaway territories in eastern Ukraine a ""genius"" move ahead of its military invasion. In an interview on ""The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show,"" Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin's recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics in eastern Ukraine on Monday was ""smart"" and ""pretty savvy."" ""I went in yesterday, and there was a television screen, and I said, 'This is genius,'"" he said. ""Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine - of Ukraine - Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that's wonderful."" ""I said, 'How smart is that?' He's going to go in and be a peacekeeper,"" added Trump, who regularly praised and sought close ties with Putin during his time in office. ""That's the strongest peace force. We could use that on our southern border. That's the strongest peace force I've ever seen. There were more army tanks than I've ever seen. They're going to keep peace, all right."" Following his recognition of the two Donbas areas, which are controlled by Russian-backed separatists, Putin moved in troops, which led to international condemnation. President Biden called the troop movement ""the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine"" and slapped Moscow with multiple sanctions on Tuesday. ""If Russia goes further with this invasion, we stand prepared to go further as with sanctions,"" Biden said. In his interview, Trump repeated his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him and said if he had remained president, Putin would never have attempted something like this. ""It never would have happened with us. Had I been in office, not even thinkable,"" Trump said. ""You know what the response was from Biden? He didn't have a response."" The former president, who has been teasing a 2024 presidential run, also released a statement on Tuesday arguing that ""there was absolutely no reason that the situation currently happening in Ukraine should have happened at all."" ""Russia has become very very rich during the Biden Administration, with oil prices doubling and soon to be tripling and quadrupling,"" he said. ""The weak sanctions are insignificant relative to taking over a country and a massive piece of strategically located land.""",Politics/The Hill,Trump on Putin plan to recognize breakaway Ukraine regions: 'This is genius',https://news.yahoo.com/trump-putin-plan-recognize-breakaway-212156109.html
2/23/2022,"Former President Trump falsely said ""everybody wanted the vaccine"" when he was in office. Trump supporters refusing to get vaccinated has driven partisan gaps in vaccination. ""And once I was out, all of a sudden people didn't want it,"" Trump said, blaming mandates for low uptake. Former President Donald Trump said ""everybody wanted"" to get a COVID-19 vaccine when he was president and blamed vaccine mandates for low vaccine uptake among some segments of the population — even though millions of his supporters have refused to get vaccinated. Trump, who falsely claimed vaccines cause autism in children as a presidential candidate, touted the development of COVID-19 vaccines while he was president. ""I think what we do get great credit for that they tried but it didn't work — even their side said you can't do that — is Operation Warp Speed,"" Trump said in an interview with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show. ""And not only the fact that the vaccines were developed in nine months as opposed to five years to 12 years."" While Trump now claims vaccine hesitancy wasn't an issue while he was president, many of his most prominent supporters and advisers pushed COVID vaccine misinformation while he was president. The former president has continued to face pushback for his staunch pro-vaccine stance from influential conservatives and his rank-and-file supporters. ""Everybody wanted the vaccine when I was there, and we were doing a million shots a day, and, you know, we mobilized,"" Trump said. But Trump didn't publicly disclose when he and former first lady Melania Trump were vaccinated at the White House before leaving office in January 2021 and didn't begin publicly promoting the vaccines until months later. In that time, as vaccines became widely available to the American public, sharp partisan gaps in vaccine uptake between Democrats and Republicans emerged. A Kaiser Family Foundation study conducted in November 2021, for example, found that Republicans and Republican-leaning independents made up 41% of the adult population but 60% of unvaccinated adults in the United States and that, when controlling for other factors, a Republican was 26 percentage points less likely to be vaccinated than a Democrat. ""And the military really did well, much better than their leaders led them, I will tell you, in the removal from Afghanistan. That I can tell you. And they were doing really well. They were delivering 'em,"" Trump said. ""And everybody wanted the vaccine. And once I was out, all of a sudden people didn't want it. And that's how you started with this whole mandate thing, which is terrible, okay, 'cause you're forcing people."" In recent months, Trump has stepped up his advocacy for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters in recent months after dismissing booster shots in August 2021 as a ""money-making operation"" for pharmaceutical companies and saying he likely wouldn't receive a third COVID shot in September (though he eventually did get one). Trump was booed by some of his fans when he announced he'd received a booster shot at an event with former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly in December 2021. Trump has also called out ""gutless"" unnamed politicians for refusing to reveal their booster status, which some interpreted to be a thinly-veiled jab at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis after DeSantis declined to say whether or not he had been boosted in a December 2021 interview. ""Many politicians — I watched a couple of politicians be interviewed, and one of the questions was, 'Did you get the booster?' because they had the vaccine. And they're all answering it like — in other words, the answer is yes, but they don't want to say it because they're gutless,"" Trump told One America News' Dan Ball. ""You gotta say it. Whether you had it or not, say it,"" Trump added. DeSantis, a possible 2024 presidential candidate who has taken a hardline stance against vaccine mandates and passports in Florida, has denied rumors of tension with Trump.
