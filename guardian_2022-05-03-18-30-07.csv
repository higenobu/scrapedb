5/3/2022,"The US bank Citigroup has said that one of its traders made an error when European stock markets suffered a “flash crash” on Monday. Trading was briefly suspended in several European markets on Monday morning, after leading share indices recorded sudden steep declines. One of the hardest hit was Sweden’s benchmark OMX 30 index, which fell by nearly 8%, but recouped most of the losses and ended the day 1.9% lower. The Europe Stoxx 600 index of Europe’s leading shares lost as much as 3% before closing down 1.5%. The UK stock market was closed for a bank holiday. “This morning one of our traders made an error when inputting a transaction,” the New York-based bank said in a statement on Monday night. “Within minutes, we identified the error and corrected it.” Flash crashes, or brief price collapses, can be caused by human error. They can be caused by “fat finger” errors – referring to someone mistyping the details of a trade – and have become more common with the rise of high-frequency trading firms. One of the biggest flash crashes happened on 6 May 2010, when the Dow Jones on Wall Street lost almost 9% of its value within minutes, and hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off share prices. However, the market quickly regained its composure and eventually closed 3% lower. An official report by the two main US regulators pointed to a $4.1bn (£2.7bn) sell order instigated by a US mutual fund, which used an automated algorithm trading strategy. This had a “hot potato” effect.

5/3/2022,"On 23 August 2020 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, police officer Rusten Shesky shot Jacob Blake seven times in front of three of his children. Blake’s name, along with those of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, was invoked in protests across the United States as part of the Black Lives Matter movement, which surged in the wake of several high-profile shootings by police officers in 2020. Sheskey said he had shot Blake after he became alarmed that he had a knife in his possession. That claim becomes even more striking when you consider that Kenosha police allowed a white teenager, Kyle Rittenhouse, to walk around with an AR-15 during a protest in the wake of Blake’s shooting and later used the weapon to shoot two anti-racism demonstrators dead. I’m not saying white privilege is the reason for the different responses from the police, but I’m not sure what other explanation is plausible. “If they would’ve held that officer accountable for something, that riot wouldn’t have happened,” Blake said on my podcast, the Rematch. “Those two people who were killed [by Rittenhouse] would still be here. And the guy that killed them, y’all let him go? And a lot of people in the United States actually celebrated this kid beating a murder.” Rittenhouse was found not guilty of charges relating to the fatal shootings, while Sheskey was never charged and returned to regular duty in April 2021. Miraculously, Blake survived and, although he is now in constant physical pain, he has a new appreciation for life. He turned 31 on Saturday and is thankful to God that he is still breathing. He is also grateful to the athletes who showed their support for him after the shooting. “If that video [of the shooting] is not being taken by that person across the street, do we know if we even see that video?” said LeBron James. “We are scared as Black people in America. Black men, Black women, Black kids, we are terrified.” Meanwhile, the Milwaukee Bucks, whose home arena is 45 minutes from where Blake was shot, boycotted Game 5 of their 2020 playoff series against the Orlando Magic in protest at the shooting, leading the NBA to reschedule all other games that night. The WNBA soon followed suit and cancelled their games. Ultimately, the players decided to resume the playoffs, with the WNBA, NBA and players’ associations coming together to create a social-reform coalition, turn many basketball arenas into voting locations and run ads during the playoffs that promote greater civic engagement. “I never had the chance to express my feelings about it so let me take the time now and tell [the athletes who supported me], thank you,” Blake said. “From the bottom of my heart. Thank you. They put their careers on the line, their reputations on the line to speak up.” It was not just Blake the Bucks showed support to: they also called his father, Jacob Blake Sr. According to reports, Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo broke down crying in front of his teammates after talking to Jacob Sr. The six-time All-Star later said talking to the Blake family was the greatest thing he did that season, which is no mean feat considering he was also named NBA MVP. Blake was still visibly in pain throughout my interview with him, even though it is two years since he was shot. But he pushed through the pain to discuss hid journey, how Shesky was never held accountable, and what it meant to him to see NBA players like Antetokounmpo, James, Chris Paul – and indeed the entire NBA and WNBA – show him their support while he was being demonized by many in the media. As I watched Blake fight through spasms and convulsions in order to give his side of the story, I couldn’t help but think none of this had to happen. Some people will ask why he didn’t obey the cops’ orders, or lay on the ground lifeless when they tazed him. But my question is why cops in the US so often shoot to kill when policing Black and Brown communities. After all we have seen countless examples of the police using restraint, and employing different tactics to disarm, deescalate and not unload their firearms when dealing with white people, even if they are armed or disobeying commands. I interviewed author Marc Lamont Hill for my book, Police Brutality And White Supremacy: The Fight Against American Traditions, and he told me: “We have to come up with solutions and strategies, so that [shooting is] not the only option. If all I have in my toolbox is a hammer, then everything is going to look like a nail … We need accountability. We need measures, we need to retrain, we need all of these things. My concern is that within the practical context of a white supremacist world, I don’t know how you can unlearn white supremacy.” I spoke with Blake about this. If there is an animal loose on the street, the authorities use tranquilizer guns to peacefully subdue the animal. They don’t immediately shoot the animal seven times in the back. What does it say about America that animals are often treated with more mercy than Black men? “The police were laughing while I was laying on the pavement,” Blake told me. “One was trying to save my life and there were others standing around laughing and cracking jokes. I heard all of it. There was an officer who was rubbing in the middle of my chest real hard and that kept me awake because I would’ve passed out, and as he was doing that, I could hear some other officers a female officer and a male officer laughing and cracking jokes.” And that’s one of the reasons Blake is grateful NBA players treated him as if his life mattered and that he wasn’t some wild beast that needed to be put down. He urged athletes to continue using their voices. “It’s gonna be heard, you have a platform. You have followers, you have fans. So people are going to hear you. They’re going to listen and they care what you guys think,” he told me. “That’s power, they made the entire world look at me through their eyes. At the end of the day, these athletes were speaking up because I am a human being.” Etan Thomas played in the NBA from 2000 through 2011.

5/3/2022,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that American TV executives love to plunder British television for their material, hence the remakes of Shameless, Skins, Till Death Us Do Part (as All in the Family) and Broadchurch (Gracepoint). But they all had one thing in common: they sucked. True, many people preferred the American retool of The Office – and not just because it didn’t star Ricky Gervais – but it is the exception that proves the rule. What is less widely acknowledged is that British and American asset-strippers remake foreign-language TV shows so that viewers in our monoglot polities don’t have to watch stuff with subtitles. The latest example is Ten Percent, a remake of the French comedy drama Dix Pour Cent, curiously broadcast on Netflix under the title Call My Agent!. Here, we look at 10 other remakes and ask: were they better or worse than the original? This British-French crime drama was adapted from the 2011 Danish-Swedish series The Bridge (Broen/Bron). The original revolved around the outlandish idea that a corpse had been found on the marvellous Øresund (or Öresund) bridge, straddling two countries and two police jurisdictions. Enter the odd couple Saga Norén (played by Sofia Helin), a gifted but emotionally distant and socially awkward Malmö detective, and her Copenhagen-based counterpart Martin Rohde (Kim Bodnia), a cheery serial philanderer, who have to work together to solve the mystery. If only anyone had listened to my pitch for an English-Welsh drama that begins with a dead sheep on the Severn Bridge, The Tunnel might not have existed. But, for three series, it did. It trumped The Bridge in bleakness since, as you will know if you have spent the 20 minutes on the Eurostar between Folkestone and Calais, it is darker down there than a Scandi noir has ever managed to be. In The Tunnel, the cross-cultural dynamic between Helin and Bodnia was replaced by the froideur of a Franco-English mesalliance between the French cop Elise Wassermann (Clémence Poésy) and the British plod Karl Roebuck (Stephen Dillane). As in the original, the entente didn’t get very cordiale: there was as much sexual tension between the two protagonists as there was between Michel Barnier and David Davis during Brexit negotiations. But the remake added something missing from the original: an Anglo-French relationship of mutual suspicion. The Tunnel may not be the only reason Brexit happened, but it didn’t help. It was the Italians’ fault. In 1959, a TV gameshow called Campanile Sera pitted teams representing two towns against each other in a series of games featuring obstacle courses. In 1962, French telly bosses, bereft after a dispute prevented the broadcast of the Tour de France, filled the schedule with their own version, called Intervilles. Live cows and bulls were among those corralled into battles of civic pride so fractious that Charles de Gaulle reportedly altered his schedule so that he could watch the weekly antics. Only in 1966 did the British get their own version. It’s a Knockout featured bizarre games, such as the one where a woman was pelted with bags of flour by opposing players while she bounced up and down on a trampoline and attempted to bat away the projectiles with a tennis racket. It’s a Knockout was never officially cancelled, but there are no plans for it to return to our screens. Happily, the French format continues. The 2012 dystopian Swedish drama Äkta Människor (Real Humans) posited that, in the near future, hubots (a portmanteau of humans and robots) will be bought as domestic servants, making humans redundant in many workplaces. What’s more, hubots will be illicitly hacked to become humans’ sexual partners. A year after its release, the format was sold to 50 countries. Gemma Chan played a domestic robot in Channel 4’s Humans. Understandably, she balked at having sex with Katherine Parkinson’s errant husband. Later, as in the Swedish version, she became involved with a maverick group of synthetic beings who rose up against their mentally and physically weaker masters. The Swedish original was cancelled after two series. The British clone lasted for three. A Mandarin replicant started broadcasting last year. As Swedish exports go, Äkta Människor proved not quite as successful as Ikea. Long before Kenneth Branagh decided his destiny was to spend hours in makeup having ludicrous moustaches applied to his face so that he could play Hercule Poirot, he interpreted another Euro shamus, namely Kurt Wallander, the hero of Henning Mankell’s most popular crime series. Over four series (so far), Branagh proved more satisfyingly lugubrious than even the two great Swedish-language interpreters of Wallander, Rolf Lassgård and Krister Henriksson. Not that it is a competition – each was cherishable. Nonetheless, it seemed wrong that Branagh’s Wallander spoke English yet read Swedish newspapers. For all his excellence as a detective spiralling into a mid-life existential crisis, Branagh has not yet played Wallander as he descends into dementia, as Henriksson did. I still get chills thinking of the scene in which Henriksson’s Wallander pulled back the clothes in his wardrobe to reveal a wall of Post-it notes, each reminding him of something he must not forget. In the 2015 Israeli TV drama False Flag, five ordinary Israelis woke to find themselves the leading suspects in the kidnap and possible murder of the Iranian minister of defence. Were they being fitted up for the crime? Were they as innocent as they claimed? Was Mossad, in fact, responsible for the kidnap? This year, this drama was adapted as Suspicion for Apple TV+. The action was shifted to New York, where the son of Katherine Newman (Uma Thurman), an American PR guru and possible future ambassador to the UK, disappeared from a luxury hotel after being attacked by four British assailants. In a cute touch, the assailants wore masks of the royal family. As in the Israeli original, there were lots of questions. Were the four Britons named for the crime the real perps? Was there a conspiracy to blame them for something they never did? Why did none of the kidnappers get to wear a Prince Andrew mask? The real mystery of the adaptation was how Thurman got so much press for such a tiny cameo. “This thriller is about as forgettable as they come,” concluded the Hollywood Reporter. This is a shame, since the original was memorable – and not only because it was based loosely on the 2010 assassination in Dubai of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, the co-founder of the military wing of the Islamist Palestinian group Hamas. One of the great joys of Sofie Gråbøl’s performance as the Copenhagen homicide detective Sarah Lund in Forbrydelsen (The Killing) was that she was not so much a woman in a man’s world as a traditionally male character played by a woman. She was as maverick as Clint Eastwood’s Dirty Harry and a frightening obsessive, like John Wayne in The Searchers. Eleven years ago, Forbrydelsen captivated British viewers. It averaged 500,000 viewers each episode when it screened on BBC Four in 2011 – and it led to Lund-style Faroese sweaters becoming must-have knitwear that year. But the show did not take off in the US. “I don’t think the original will ever screen there,” the creator Søren Sveistrup told me in 2011. “It’s unthinkable that Americans would ever screen it with subtitles.” Hence the 2011 remake, starring Mireille Enos as Detective Sarah Linden, investigating a murder in Seattle, a US city as wet as Copenhagen. But while the US version received ecstatic reviews and many awards across the Atlantic, it induced only a sense of deja vu in many European viewers. The adaptation was very close to the original, not just in terms of the knitwear, but also with the case Linden investigated in the first series. As with Branagh’s Wallander, though, perhaps there is room enough in the world for both versions. Hatufim, the espionage drama on which Channel 4’s US hit Homeland was based, became Israel’s highest-rated drama when it was broadcast in 2010. Before a single frame of it was shot, the story was bought by US TV for an English-language adaptation. The showrunners Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon had finished working on 24 and developed Homeland as a thriller every bit as tense as the Kiefer Sutherland crime vehicle. Claire Danes was cast as Carrie Mathison, a CIA operative with bipolar disorder, while Damian Lewis played Nicholas Brody, a Marine Corps scout sniper traumatised after his kidnap and torture by al-Qaida. The pilot of Homeland cost more than both seasons of Hatufim. The dramatic focus shifted in the remake on to the relationship between Mathison and Brody and, later, on to her mental health. Gideon Raff, who created, wrote and directed Hatufim (which means abductees in Hebrew), became an executive producer on Homeland. He told the Guardian the two dramas catered for different sensibilities: “What’s relevant for an American audience is the enemy within, whether the war hero’s been turned. Israeli audiences are more interested in the relationships, the emotional ride, the secrets and suspense.” In 1999, a handsome playboy called Armando Mendoza became the head of Colombia’s leading couture company, Eco Moda. But, as so often happens in life and art, his good looks were inversely proportional to his business acumen. Were it not for the fact that his secretary, Beatriz “Betty” Pinzón, had fallen in love with him and was covering for his incompetence, Eco Moda’s board of directors would have binned him off sharpish. But eventually the firm’s ruin came to light, Mendoza’s Prince Charming was disgraced and Betty fled to the port city of Cartagena, where she had an emotional and physical makeover, returning in triumph – minus her unbecoming specs and unfortunate fringe – to become the new president of the firm.Such was Yo Soy Betty, la Fea (which translates as I Am Betty, the Ugly One), one of the best-rated dramas in Latin America. Essentially a soap opera Cinderella with a fast-fashion twist, but minus the validation by Prince Charming, it was shown around the world in dubbed or subtitled versions. I particularly love the title of the Japanese version – Betty, Ai to Uragiri no Hishojitsu which, as you know, translates as Betty, the Secretarial Office of Love and Betrayal.Only in 2006 did ABC in the US make an English-language version called Ugly Betty. America Ferrera played Betty Suarez, a hapless, bespectacled assistant made to do ridiculous jobs and work ludicrously long hours for her fearsome boss, the editor of a grotesque fashion magazine. She also fell prey to bitchy remarks from colleagues who, implausibly, could afford to wear Roland Mouret cocktail dresses to work. It established a cult audience. But as Hadley Freeman pointed out in the Guardian, storylines were too predictable and jokes well worn. No one needed another gag about a haute couture poncho. Several Korean-language dramas have been remade in English. In the 2013 medical drama Gut Dakteo, Joo Won played Park Si-on, an autistic savant given six months to prove himself as a resident in the paediatrics department of a hospital. Some colleagues distrusted him, thinking he was a soulless robot who couldn’t empathise with his patients. Unsurprisingly, this proved to be nonsense. Si-on quickly became the kind of hero that TV dramas, especially medical ones, favour: an underdog of a genius battling prejudice, finding love and saving lives.In 2017, Gut Dakteo was remade in the US as The Good Doctor. Freddie Highmore played Shaun Murphy, a young autistic savant surgical resident at a fictional hospital in San Jose, California. It quickly filled the voids left by Nurse Jackie, House and ER. But there was a visual twist: when the director was particularly keen on calling attention to his genius, organs, veins and glands floated above his head like illustrations ripped from a medical-school textbook. The Good Doctor, like the original, became an award-winning drama and resonated with many people on the autism spectrum. “The Good Doctor does a fine job of navigating this razor’s edge,” wrote Kerry Magro on the website Autism Speaks, noting that it shows “several characteristics that can accompany an autism diagnosis … such as social awkwardness, lack of eye contact, playing with his hands during stressful situations”. The show was recently renewed for a sixth series. In a small French mountain town, the dead begin to return as if their deaths never happened. This was the premise of Les Revenants, a 2004 French film that was adapted into a Canal+ series of the same name in 2012. It aired, despite the subtitles, to much acclaim on Netflix. Not so the 2015 US adaptation, The Returned, even though it transferred the action from the French Alps to the marvellously named town of Squamish in British Columbia. The problem for Brian Moylan, writing in the Guardian, was that he could not connect with the characters’ plight, only with the $18m modernist house in which one of the families lived. “It is so beautiful, especially when lit up at night. Seriously, when I think of this show, I just think of that house. That’s probably a bad sign.” And it was: the remake was cancelled after one series.",Arts/Television & radio,"Mind your language! 10 of the best (and worst) foreign TV remakes, from The Killing to Homeland",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/03/mind-your-language-10-of-the-best-and-worst-foreign-tv-remakes-from-the-killing-to-homeland
5/3/2022,"US airlines are still experiencing staffing shortages as air travel rebounded after initial Covid-19 shutdowns in 2020 when many airline workers were encouraged to go on furlough, resign, or retire early. The phenomenon promises to disrupt travel for flyers even as Americans largely seek to return to many pre-pandemic habits, including air travel for work and tourism. At JetBlue, flight delays and cancellations have been attributed to staff shortages. Transport Workers United, which represents about 5,000 flight attendants at JetBlue, criticized the airline’s blaming of flight attendants for not accepting enough assignments, causing delays and cancellations. The union argued JetBlue had responded to staff shortages and operational problems by increasing disciplinary actions toward workers, including increasing the amount of critical coverage days workers must be available to work or else accrue disciplinary attendance points that could lead to termination. “Historically, JetBlue has always run a skeleton staff of crew members in all their departments,” said a longtime flight attendant at JetBlue who requested to remain anonymous as they are not authorized to speak with the media. The flight attendant said problems related to Covid-19 such as canceled, rescheduled or delayed flights that prolong time on duty or away from home and difficulties with transportation and hotel lodging for flight attendants have made many workers reluctant to accept extra assignments. They also said many flight attendants experiencing delays or flight changes have waited several hours for JetBlue to get them a hotel room or transportation to a hotel in a layover city, cutting into their rest time. Some have given up and paid for a hotel or transportation out of pocket. “You are kept hostage at times and are unable to get home. This is really hard for people that do have children or parents that they help take care of,” the flight attendant said. “They’re not thinking of us as humans. We’re still human beings involved in all of this too. We want to see our company succeed and we all want to come to work, we want to do the best we can, we want the passengers to keep coming back, but I feel like the thought of us as actual human beings has been removed from the equation. We’re just robots that are here to get the job done and I think that’s the thing we’re struggling with the most, that there is no respect for the workers any more.” Gary Peterson, vice-president of the air division at Transport Workers United, argued JetBlue and other carriers have been competing in a race to the bottom terms of how workers are treated, retaining enough workers, and maintaining airline jobs as career jobs. “I think there’s a systemic problem in the industry – everybody’s trying to compete against the lowest carrier, instead of setting themselves up to be the premier carrier,” said Peterson. “Sleeping in the hallway at the airport – that never used to happen in the industry, and now it’s becoming the new norm.” At Spirit Airlines, staffing problems have contributed to four operation meltdowns since August 2021, an unheard-of frequency according to the Association of Flight Attendants – Communications Workers of America (AFA-CWA). Workers at Spirit Airlines have protested outside airports in Las Vegas, Orlando and Dallas in recent weeks over contract violations by the airlines, mass cancellations that have stranded flight attendants, and persistent staffing shortages. Don Reno Intreglia, a Spirit Airlines flight attendant based in Orlando, Florida, and AFA-CWA vice-president for Spirit Airlines, said the airline’s cancellation team and a separate team that handles flight attendant scheduling will get out of sync or fall behind, causing a domino effect in operations and leaving flight attendants to deal with frustrated passengers with no information. The result, he said, had been flight attendants being stranded away from home with no hotel lodging, left for up to 30 hours with no answers or resolution. “It’s been horrible on the morale for the flight attendants, because you’re sleeping on an airport floor, you’ve got pretty much nowhere to go. We had flight attendants who were getting kicked out of airports in the middle of the night,” said Intreglia. “We want the traveling public to know that we’re trying to pressure management into making serious changes, so that we are prepared for the summer travel.” Pilots have been experiencing similar difficulties. Pilots with Alaska Airlines are voting on a strike authorization as new union contract negotiations continue and the airline experiences a shortage of pilots. At Delta Air Lines, pilots represented by the Airline Pilots Association have been protesting over the past several weeks outside Delta hubs in Seattle, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Detroit, Los Angeles and Minneapolis, over excessive scheduling and fatigue. “Our pilots are tired and fatigued,” said Captain Evan Baach. “Our pilots are working record amounts of overtime, we’re working longer days, we have shorter nights in between our duty periods. We want the company to match their words with action and make changes to the pilot schedules.” A spokesperson for Delta Air Lines said in an email, “Pilot schedules remain in line with all requirements set by the FAA as well as those outlined in our pilot contract. All of our people, including our pilots, are working hard to restore our airline and deliver for our customers as we emerge from the pandemic. We are grateful for and proud of their efforts.” JetBlue and Spirit Airlines did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",News/Business,‘We’re just robots’: US airline workers stranded amid staff shortages,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/airline-workers-stranded-staff-shortages-us
5/3/2022,"Victoria’s peak social services body says the state’s election year budget has delivered “lean” funding for the community organisations sector to advocate for the most vulnerable, but welcomed “significant” investments in health and education. The state’s major healthcare groups have praised the budget’s $12bn health funding blitz, although the peak body for public hospitals has warned it will take time for workforce initiatives to plug critical gaps in the burdened health system. But the Victorian Council of Social Services chief executive, Emma King, said the budget was “lean” and warned the challenge of long-term funding for the sector remained. “There is not enough in this budget for us to feel confident,” King told Guardian Australia. King said it was “incredibly sad” that a $150m package, which transitioned homeless people who stayed in hotels during the pandemic into homes, would not be extended. “I don’t know what happens to those people,” she said. “We make choices about what we invest in and I don’t think that we should be making choices that involve taking accommodation options away from people who otherwise are going to be on our streets or couch surfing or sleeping in a car.” The budget includes a $8.3m investment in the next financial year to support Victorians experiencing homelessness and sleeping rough to overcome barriers to housing. The Victorian Greens said the government was failing to tackle the housing affordability crisis, which the party says remains the biggest cost of living issue. The party also took aim at the government for backing down on its social housing levy – estimated to raise $800m a year – that it dumped after heavy backlash from key industry groups. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service accused the Andrews government of underfunding its service, warning that as a result “more of our children will be removed from their families, more of our people will be incarcerated, and more of our people will die in custody.” “It will cost the government far more money to ‘cure’ this short and long-term harm than to prevent it,” the service said in a statement. It warned that the government could not fulfil the potential of its treaty process, the Yoorrook truth-telling commission and its Closing the Gap justice targets when Indigenous people could not “access the legal services that they need.” The health funding announced in the budget includes $4.2bn for the state’s pandemic response, $1.3bn for continuing to implement reforms from the royal commission into mental health and $2.9bn worth of new health infrastructure. The government will invest in hiring up to help train up to 7,000 healthcare workers, including 5,000 nurses. Another $333m will be used to hire 400 new staff for the triple zero call service, which has been plagued by lengthy wait times, with the coroner investigating four deaths linked to call delays. The Victorian Healthcare Association – which represents public hospitals – said initiatives such as the training of more healthcare workers would provide a necessary boost to stabilise the sector. The association’s chief executive, Tom Symondson, said it would take time for additional staff to enter the sector and relieve pressures in the system. The Victorian Ambulance Union secretary, Danny Hill, said the investment in 400 new call takers and dispatchers was welcomed. Hill said further work was needed on the call-taking system and integrating referral pathways to ensure paramedics were not sent to non-emergency situations. “The increased demand is not due to an increase in car accidents, heart attacks and strokes,” he said. “It’s the increased reliance on ‘000’ and ambulances due to issues in other parts of the system. So, it is good to see the spending aimed at those areas.” The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation Victorian branch backed a $59m investment to fund 2,250 registered undergraduate student nurses over two years and $9.8m to support 75 registered undergraduate student midwives to boost the state’s midwife staffing pool. The branch secretary, Lisa Fitzpatrick, said the government’s near-$700m investment in expanding the Better at Home program – which helps more Victorians receive treatment at home – was a “smart and efficient way” to improve patient flows to the state’s hospitals. The Australian Education Union’s Victoria branch president, Meredith Peace, backed the government’s $779m investment in almost 2,000 new teachers, as well as the $1.8bn school infrastructure spend, but said the government “missed the mark” for Tafe funding. “Despite important investment in recent years, Victorians who rely on Tafes to provide the vocational education they need will be disappointed with this budget,” Peace said. “The state government’s own review makes it plain that Victoria’s Tafes are not funded to cover the full cost of training. This budget does nothing to address this funding shortfall.” The Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said commitments for employers – such as the $99.8m to improve the Services Victoria interface – were modest but would make it easier to do business in the state. The chamber also welcomed investments in major investments and tourism, including $2.6bn for Victoria to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games in its regions. John Manning, the vice-president of rating agency Moody’s, said the recovery “exceeded our initial expectations” but inflation and interest rate rises would make it harder for the Victorian government to contain costs and put pressure on its Aa1 rating. “Despite the underlying strength of the Victorian and broader Australian economy, we expect Victoria’s debt burden will not stabilise before the end of fiscal [year] 2027, further increasing negative pressure on the state’s rating,” he said. However, rival agency S&P said its outlook for the state’s AA credit rating was stable, despite debt that is set to rise significantly to fund $21bn a year in infrastructure spending.",News/Australia news,Victoria’s budget delivers ‘lean’ funding for community organisations but is welcomed by others,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/victorias-budget-delivers-lean-funding-for-community-organisations-but-is-welcomed-by-others
5/3/2022,"Boris Johnson has admitted that the government has not done enough to alleviate the pain of the cost of living crisis, as he struggled to articulate any extra help that a pensioner choosing between heating and eating could access. The prime minister also rebuffed the prospect of a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, saying the government wanted to encourage energy companies to invest to bring down costs. Speaking on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Johnson said: “I accept that those contributions from the taxpayer, because that’s what it is – taxpayers’ money – isn’t going to be enough immediately to help cover everybody.” He added: “There is more that we can do but the crucial thing is to make sure we deal with the prices over the medium and long term.” Johnson was asked what more 77-year-old pensioner Elsie could do to cut spending and was told she was already cutting down to one meal a day and spending days on buses to keep warm. He said he “didn’t want her to have to cut back on anything” but could not articulate what further help would look like. “If you put a windfall tax on on the energy companies, what that means is that you discourage them from making the investments that we want to see that will, in the end, keep energy prices lower for everybody. This is going to be something we have to fix.” His comments came as BP announced $6.2bn (£5bn) profits for the first three months of this year, profits that the TUC called “obscene” at a time of soaring bills. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary, said: “The oil and gas firms may be doing their job for the shareholders of their companies but the government is negligently failing to do its job for the people of this country.”",News/Business,Boris Johnson admits efforts to ease cost of living crisis not enough,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/boris-johnson-efforts-to-ease-cost-of-living-crisis-not-enough

I still look for that wanderlust in literature today, which is why I was drawn to Great Circle by Maggie Shipstead. The book is about the life of female pilot Marian, who is rescued as a baby from a sinking ship in the early part of the century. It is a novel of breathtaking scope, flitting from the US to London to Antarctica and Canada. I was swept along by Marian’s love story and missed her when it finished. Right now I’m immersed in the stories of women by women because I am one of the judges of the 2022 Women’s prize for fiction and Great Circle is on the shortlist. Judging has brought two new authors into my life: Louise Erdrich, whose thought-provoking book The Sentence is a masterfully written ghost story about a haunted library (among other things) and Lisa Allen-Agostini, who introduced me to the vibrant Althea, the protagonist of The Bread The Devil Knead. Both books tackle serious subject matter but also deliver witty writing that makes you laugh out loud. And two books I have found helpful this month are Travis Alabanza’s None of the Above and therapist Julia Samuel’s Every Family Has a Story. I wrote a book on parenting teens last year and since then I am regularly asked for advice. I feel these two thoughtful books are helpful for worried mums and dads. Alabanza’s experience as a mixed race trans person offers some insights into developing identities that many parents would benefit hugely from reading (it is out in August) and Julia Samuel’s book is a wise, informative guide on the tangle of family relationships. Mum, What’s Wrong with You? by Lorraine Candy (HarperCollins £9.99) is available in paperback now. To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply. The winner of the 2022 Women’s prize will be announced on 15 June. I don’t normally read political or economic books but Kleptopia by Tom Burgis was a wild ride of a read – better than any spy novel. It’s about “dirty money” and the trail it leaves across the world. The sheer deviousness of the people involved beggars belief, as does the way eye-watering sums of money are filtered through them to become “clean”. I honestly can’t recommend this book enough, it was a real eye-opener. On a recent trip away I took Farah Heron’s Kamila Knows Best, a delightful, modern-day retelling of Jane Austen’s Emma, set among a Canadian Muslim community. The other book I read on holiday couldn’t have been more different: Mary Jean Chan’s incredible Costa Poetry award-winning collection Flèche, which examines everything from the poet’s relationship with her mother to multilingualism.Flèche is a book I’ve had unread on my shelf for a long time, as were my next two reads: Joya Goffney’s very cute YA novel Excuse Me While I Ugly Cry, and Cho Nam-Joo’s incredible Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982, which is translated by Jamie Chang. I’m still thinking about the latter book, even though it’s been a while since I finished it.But to-read piles wait for no woman, and I’m already on to my next read: Anita Desai’s Clear Light of Day which, despite being published in 1980 and set before, during and after Partition, still feels very relevant today. This month I’ve loved The Trip to Echo Spring and The Lonely City, both by Olivia Laing. I only recently discovered Laing, whose books have since had me completely engrossed. I started with Funny Weather: Art in an Emergency and went from there. I love the way she combines memoir with critical analysis and research. The Lonely City, about New York, is beautifully constructed and was a pleasure to read. I was more reluctant to read The Trip to Echo Spring, as I recognised some of my own experiences in its description and it seemed too close to home. The subject matter (why alcoholics, specifically alcoholic writers, drink) is close to home for Laing, too, and I welcomed her honesty. I didn’t get the same sense of urgency from it that drives her other works; it’s a more reflective, meandering narrative, filled with compassion, honesty and courage. Memoir, research paper and travel diary merged into one, The Trip to Echo Spring is a wonderful, dreamlike, yet startlingly real piece of writing.",Arts/Books,What we’re reading: writers and readers on the books they enjoyed in April,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/03/what-were-reading-writers-and-readers-on-the-books-they-enjoyed-in-april
5/3/2022,"Stephanie – apparently a meal Scott Morrison cooked for Sunday dinner is causing quite a stir. What is the deal? Oh dear. So, on Sunday the prime minister posted a picture to Facebook of a brinjal curry – a dish made with eggplant and okra – alongside what he said was a “classic chicken korma”. I’m truly sorry for showing you this cursed image but it has to be seen to be understood: This article includes content provided by Facebook. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. In the caption below the picture, he wrote: “Nice to have a night at home. So curry it is. Sri Lankan Tamarind Eggplant and Okra Curry and a classic Chicken Korma. Strong Curry. Strong Economy. Stronger Future.” Why does the chicken in that (alleged) curry look … raw? Funny you should ask that. You’re not the only one – it’s all the internet’s been talking about since he posted it. One of the top voted comments on the post itself says, “Lovely piece of raw chicken centre right of frame!! Enjoy!” To which Morrison replied: “I can reassure you, the chicken was cooked 👍🏻”. People were not reassured. So was it actually cooked? Did he serve his family raw chicken curry? Morrison has defended his culinary skills, claiming the appearance of the meat in the photo was “just the way the light bounced off the skin of the chicken” and it was, in fact, cooked. He told Melbourne’s Fox FM radio on Tuesday that people “went back for seconds”. “It was in the pan for a good 45 minutes I can tell you, because I had it there myself,” he said. But many people remain unconvinced. I mean, you could potentially argue that the cut of chicken shown in the image may be from the thigh or another part of the bird that doesn’t go completely white when cooked, but, equally, you could not. straight into the graphic design pullquote hall of fame pic.twitter.com/xfhw3UQqtu Why is the prime minister posting a picture of his dinner to social media anyhow? Didn’t we all stop posting food pics back in 2014? He does this kind of thing all the time. That Scott Morrison likes to cook a curry is one of those key strategic details of the prime minister’s private life that has been cultivated for public consumption. In Sean Kelly’s 2021 book The Game, he writes how Morrison developed this public penchant for cooking curries in 2015, when it looked as if he had a shot at being PM: He cooked a curry once a week – just once – and liked rugby league. So few details, but such talkative details! They told us he loved his family and made sure he had time to spend with them; he was modern because he knew how to cook; but he only cooked once a week, because he was still a real man, with traditional values and an important job. Before becoming prime minister, back when he was in the wings as mere federal treasurer, he even went on ABC’s Kitchen Cabinet and cooked Sri Lankan fish curry and “Scomosas” (sorry, sorry) with political commentator Annabel Crabb. Much of the public refused to swallow what they were served in that episode, though. There was Morrison cooking Sri Lankan food and confessing to Crabb that he had fallen in love with it after a trip to the country in 2013, when he was immigration minister. What he didn’t mention was that on his return from that trip, he doubled down on his hardline “stop the boats” policy. Within a few months, he was taken to the high court because he held 157 Tamil asylum seekers, including 37 children, on a boat for almost a month while he tried to deport them. Happy to cook their food, but not give them safety. So, uh, how embarrassed should we be here? About Australia’s immigration policy? Extremely. About the (allegedly) uncooked (alleged) curry? Well, it’s made it into the Indian press in the middle of an election campaign.

5/3/2022,"Complaints against Queensland police have increased by 25% so far this year, the state’s Crime and Corruption Commission told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday. The CCC’s acting chair, Bruce Barbour, said the increase, which resulted in 1,426 complaints in total, was linked to “positive action” taken to review the handling of domestic violence investigations and the “failure of police staff to comply with the commissioner’s direction regarding Covid-19 vaccine and workplace health and safety”. Barbour spoke of the figures during a hearing of the parliamentary Crime and Corruption Committee regarding the CCC’s activities from January to the end of March. Opposition MPs used Tuesday’s hearing to continue the LNPs push for the equivalent of a royal commission into what it describes as the state’s “integrity crisis”. Pressed on whether the CCC could deliver such a probe, Barbour said that the watchdog “doesn’t have a general or broad remit to do wide ranging inquiries” and that even if such an inquiry did fall within its jurisdiction, the CCC would require additional government funding. Queensland’s integrity commissioner, Dr Nikola Stepanov, has also backed a commission of inquiry into a “multitude of integrity-related issues” involving the government and public service that would have the legal powers and protections of a royal commission. Stepanov – whose office regulates lobbying in Queensland – has previously raised concerns about interference with her office by the Public Service Commission (PSC), which controls her agency’s budget and staffing. Those concerns include allegations the PSC removed and wiped the contents of a laptop used by an employee, and complaints that the PSC had gradually stripped resources and key staff from the integrity commissioner’s office. Barbour said that the CCC had recently finished a draft report investigating those allegations, dubbed “Operation Workshop”, which he anticipated would be completed over coming weeks before moving on to the procedural fairness stage. Barbour also used the hearing to trumpet the body’s success in busting organised crime, highlighting a 13-month investigation which culminated last Friday in a sting which seized 9kg of methamphetamine – estimated to have a street value of approximately $1.73m – “substantial sums of cash” and the arrest of a 37-year-old man. The Queensland police union last year called on the CCC to be stripped of its responsibilities for investigating major and organised crime, with civil libertarians also raising concerns that the CCC had become “a super police force” and that this role has overshadowed its function as a corruption watchdog. Barbour has been acting CCC chair since Alan MacSporran resigned from the role in January, seven weeks after a parliamentary committee found he failed in his duty to ensure the watchdog “acted independently and impartially”.",News/Australia news,Queensland corruption watchdog records 25% increase in complaints against police,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/queensland-corruption-watchdog-records-25-increase-in-complaints-against-police
5/3/2022,"Therese Shechter’s film is about the difficult and still taboo subject of women who don’t want children (not now, not ever) and those who regret having had them, and must now persuade others and themselves that they are not therefore evil. She takes us from the beginnings of the “childfree” movement that became a part of the postwar feminist wave, an idea that foundered in the Reaganite 80s – and the extraordinary case of Marcia Drut-Davis who, in 1974, appeared on the US TV news show 60 Minutes to explain her reasons for not wanting children, and was the next day fired from her job as a teacher. Women who do not want children are under attack from the right for being selfish and woke – and women of colour who feel the same way are under attack from the left for supposedly playing along with the creepy racist and eugenicist tradition that wants to see the African-American population kept in check. This film engages with those women who want to live their lives outside the tradition of partnership, homeownership and parenthood – although it could perhaps have shed more light on the idea that there is a specific moral or societally useful mode of living that childfree women can consciously put in place of traditional motherhood. And it could have spoken more clearly about those “regretting” mothers who still love their children but just do not embrace the mother relationship. How does that feeling break down in practice? Then, of course, there is the question of what we think about men who never want children. There are plenty of men like this and their reluctance is smiled or shrugged at, rather than seen as something unnatural. At all events, this is an interesting and worthwhile essay.

5/3/2022,"The Reserve Bank of Australia has acted to lift interest rates from emergency lows at its 3 May meeting to curb soaring inflation hitting households. It’s the first time in more than a decade that the cash rate target has been increased, reinforcing expectations property prices will fall, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. Here’s what the move means for homeowners with mortgages. Monthly mortgage repayment increases will be relatively modest under the new rate rise of 0.35%. But the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, has warned borrowers should brace themselves for further hikes to bring inflation back into the target band. Under the new rate, the monthly payment on a $600,000 home loan would rise to $2,324, an increase of $74, Finder said. For someone with a $1m loan, repayments would rise by $130 a month. But if the cash rate rises to 2% by May next year, as predicted by Westpac, RateCity said repayments for the average borrower with a $500,000 debt would rise by about $511. CoreLogic research director, Tim Lawless, said under a 100 basis point lift in variable mortgage rates, a new borrower in Sydney would be facing a rise in monthly mortgage costs of $486. Under a 200 basis point rise, mortgage costs would be $1,005 higher than current levels. Nationally, a 100 basis point lift would lead to a $323 rise in monthly mortgage costs, jumping to $668 under a 200 basis point lift. “Past research from the RBA has pointed to ‘high end’ housing markets with higher investor concentrations being more sensitive to changes in interest rates in the short term,” Lawless said. “This may be why Sydney and Melbourne markets are already seeing price declines, with more affordable housing markets expected to eventually follow the downward trend.” Lawless said those on fixed-rate loans would temporarily be shielded from rate hikes, while the recent rise in fixed-term mortgage lending would help to insulate homeowners. “While they will need to refinance down the track, by that time, labour markets are likely to have tightened further and income growth picked up,” he said. Lawless said mortgage distress was likely to be further minimised to some extent by serviceability assessments at the time loans were delivered, and the fact borrowers were generally well ahead of repayments. Senior editor of money at Finder, Sarah Megginson, said the rate rise, along with a cooling property market, would probably lead to further hikes in home loans. “Some recent buyers may be caught out now – or when their fixed rate ends,” she said. Lawless said the higher interest rates were likely to add further downwards pressure on housing growth rates. He said major capital cities such as Sydney and Melbourne were already “losing steam” due to affordability constraints, higher fixed-term mortgage rates and lower levels of consumer sentiment. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “A higher cash rate implies higher variable mortgage rates, a reduction in borrowing capacity and tighter serviceability assessments for prospective borrowers,” he said. Lawless said the extent of a housing market downturn depended on how high and how fast interest rates rose, on top of a variety of other economic factors. “Such a low unemployment rate, along with an expectation for higher income growth, should keep mortgage distress and forced sales at relatively low levels,” he said.",News/Australia news,Paying off a mortgage?
