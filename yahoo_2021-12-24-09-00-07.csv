12/24/2021,"WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) — The parents of actor Alicia Witt were found dead inside their Massachusetts home by police after she hadn't heard from them in several days and asked a relative to check on them. The deaths of Robert Witt, 87, and Diane Witt, 75, who were found Monday night, are not considered suspicious, police in Worcester said. “I reached out to a cousin who lives close to my parents to check on them. Sadly, the outcome was unimaginable,” Witt wrote in a statement. “I ask for some privacy at this time to grieve and to wrap my head around this turn of events, and this surreal loss.”  There were reports the couple had been having furnace problems and were using a space heater, police said, but firefighters said there were no signs of carbon monoxide in the home, The Telegram & Gazette reported. There were no obvious signs of trauma, police Lt. Sean Murtha said. Autopsies are scheduled. Witt made her acting debut at age 7 in 1984's “Dune” and has also appeared in “Orange Is the New Black,” “Twin Peaks” and “The Walking Dead.”  She is also a classically trained pianist and recording artist whose latest album “The Conduit” was released in the fall.",U.S./Associated Press,Parents of actor Alicia Witt found dead in their home,https://news.yahoo.com/parents-actor-alicia-witt-found-165408824.html
12/24/2021,"When relatives hadn’t heard from the seven members of the Hernandez family for a few days, they asked authorities in Minnesota do a wellness check on Saturday night. What police discovered shocked the community of Moorhead, a small city on the North Dakota border, to the core: all seven family members, ranging in age from 37 to 7, were lying dead in their beds in the duplex home. “I went to the floor above and I entered into the room and all the family was together,” Eric Bravo Mejia, a pastor who knew the family and rushed to the home after getting a panicked phone call on Saturday, told Valley News Live. “They were there dead. And I went to another room and there was the niece dead. And the uncle. Also dead. All dead. It was an impact that at this moment I can’t even understand. It’s something you can’t even explain, the impact it has in seeing them all there.” Authorities initially said it wasn’t clear how the family perished, but they ruled out criminal activity and said there were no signs of obvious trauma. On Wednesday, Police Chief Shannon Monroe said investigators had found the cause of the shocking incident: carbon monoxide poisoning. As reported by the Star Tribune, the family had lived in Minnesota for seven years after immigrating from Honduras. Their deaths were also reported by local Honduran outlets, which claimed the family was from San Francisco de Yojoa, a town about two hours south of San Pedro Sula. The household included brothers Belin Hernandez, 37, and Eldor Hernandez Castillo, 32, as well as Marleny Pinto, 34, and her 19-year-old niece Mariela Guzman Pinto. There were also three children: Breylin Hernandez, 16; Mike Hernandez, 7; Marbely Hernandez, 5. “These are terrific members of our community and this is a huge and tragic loss at the holiday season,” Monroe said. While searching the home, investigators identified two potential sources of the poisoning: a furnace and a Kia van that were both in the garage. It was not immediately clear that the furnace was broken, which would cause poisoning, and the family had been found dressed “lightly,” indicating that the home was properly heated on the evening of their deaths. And though the battery on the Kia was dead, the gas tank was not empty, which Monroe claims is usually the case when a car causes monoxide poisoning. Investigators are testing the victims’ blood to see if hydrogen cyanide, a chemical found from motor exhaust, is detected. Though a carbon monoxide detector was found inside the house, it had been removed from the wall and was missing batteries. Ultra Devout Sisters Cut Off Contact With Mom—Then Mysteriously Ended Up Dead With Dad According to Minnesota law, detectors must be installed by landlords within 10 feet of each room in multifamily buildings. Occupants of these homes, however, must ensure that monitors are maintained and functioning. The Hernandez family had already endured extraordinary hardship leaving their home country, Mejia said. “They always tried to be very united together. My heart hurts because I love them so much. It’s so painful for me. They were a family. A family well loved,” he said. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

12/24/2021,"Former President Donald Trump is continuing to advocate for COVID-19 vaccination. In an interview with conservative commentator Candace Owens, Trump called the COVID-19 vaccines ""one of the greatest achievements of mankind"" after he revealed earlier this week he received his booster dose. Owens suggested the fact that ""more people have died"" since the vaccines became widely available might call their effectiveness into question, but Trump rejected this notion. ""No, the vaccine worked,"" he said. ""But some people aren't taking it. The ones that get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don't take their vaccine."" Trump went on to say that ""if you take the vaccine, you're protected,"" and ""if you do"" still get COVID-19 while vaccinated, ""it's a very minor form"" of it. He added, ""People aren't dying when they take their vaccine."" The comments came after Trump said at an event with former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that he received his COVID-19 booster dose. This prompted some boos from the crowd, but Trump told his supporters they should ""take credit"" for the vaccines and that by being against vaccines, ""you're playing right into their hands."" While in office, Trump declined to get vaccinated in public like then-Vice President Mike Pence did, and it was only revealed that Trump received his vaccine at the White House nearly two months later. President Biden during a speech earlier this week praised Trump for his comments about getting a booster dose, saying this ""may be one of the few things he and I agree on,"" and he also thanked the efforts of ""the prior administration"" on vaccines. Trump later told Fox News he was ""very appreciative"" of Biden's comments. ""It has to be a process of healing in this country,"" Trump said, ""and that will help a lot.""

12/24/2021,"BOSTON (AP) — A former Boston College student who prosecutors say drove her boyfriend to take his own life with thousands of text messages pleaded guilty Thursday to involuntary manslaughter. Under terms of a plea deal, Inyoung You, 23, received a 2 1/2 year suspended jail sentence and 10 years of probation and was barred by a judge in Suffolk Superior Court from profiting from her case in any way. The sentence means You can avoid time behind bars if she adheres to all the terms of her probation, which includes continued mental health treatment and community service. Prosecutors said You sent Alexander Urtula, 22, of Cedar Grove, New Jersey, tens of thousands of messages in the last two months of their relationship, including many urging him to “go kill yourself.” Urtula died in Boston in May 2019, the day of his Boston College graduation. The investigation described You and Urtula's 18-month-long relationship as “tumultuous, dysfunctional, and unhealthy,” and found You, ""engaged in deeply disturbing and at times relentless verbally, physically and psychologically abusive behavior toward Mr. Urtula,"" according to a statement from the office of Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins released after Thursday's hearing. Those actions intensified in the days and hours before Urtula's death, the office said. You, who was born in South Korea and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, sent Urtula more than 47,000 text messages from late March 2019 until his death in which she “repeatedly told the victim that he should kill himself or die and waged a campaign of abuse that stripped the victim of his free will,"" the office said. “Words matter,"" Rollins said in the statement. “Demeaning language, ridicule and verbal abuse can deeply impact people.""  The plea deal was reached in consultation with the Urtula family, Rollins said. The family in a statement read in court described driving to Boston for a day of celebration and instead finding themselves planning a funeral. “We bear no feelings of anger or reprisal. We believe that time will take us through in the moments we mourn and celebrate his life,” the family said. Before her arraignment in November 2019 when she originally pleaded not guilty, You, through a public relations firm, released some of the text messages suggesting she tried to stop Urtula and alerted Urtula’s brother in the moments before his death. You was given the opportunity to speak in court, but declined. Her lawyer said she was “very distraught.”  Attorney Steven Kim said You is a “wonderful young woman who has deep, deep remorse.” The case was compared to that of Michelle Carter, who garnered national headlines and an HBO film. The young Massachusetts woman was sentenced to 15 months in jail after she was convicted in 2017 of involuntary manslaughter for using text messages and phone calls to encourage her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to kill himself in 2014. Her attorney argued that her messages were protected free speech.",U.S./Associated Press,Woman who texted boyfriend to kill himself pleads guilty,https://news.yahoo.com/woman-texted-boyfriend-kill-himself-171134451.html
12/24/2021,"Guido Vanham is a Belgian virologist who's been sending letters to his children during the pandemic. The text of his most recent letter is printed below with permission from his son Peter Vanham. Vanham says the virus will eventually weaken and meanwhile to keep following COVID-19 regulations.  Dear Peter, Johan, and Nele, Dear grandchildren,  Your mom and I are so very much looking forward to celebrating the holidays with you — and especially with the newest member of our family! We're so glad you're all safe and that Valeria had a good pregnancy and got herself protected by taking a vaccine (and soon a booster) early. We know you're worried also for the kids, who are facing a difficult situation in school. They now have to wear masks and are asked to get vaccinated even when they run a lower risk of getting sick themselves. You told me how even some of your friends reacted extremely to that news.  But I've read all the studies about it and it's very safe for the boys and children their age (5- to 12-year-olds) to get vaccinated. They also won't have much, if any, troubles from wearing a mask.  They might even like wearing a mask if you frame it right. They get to do what adults are doing and do their part in helping people from getting sick. My experience is that if you put a positive spin on it and ask them for their opinion, they're often more willing to be ""courageous"" than you might think.  As for our newly born granddaughter who's barely a month old: You're already through the most critical phase as Valeria got vaccinated during her pregnancy and with that protected herself and the baby. Even now as she breastfeeds, she passes on antibodies that help the baby protect herself.  Sadly, the Omicron ""variant"" of the COVID-19 virus is spreading all over the world now. And I know that you're wondering: What should we expect? Is this going to be the first wave all over again or will we be better off?  My assessment is: This may be the most contagious variant yet, with a possible tsunami of infections and sadly little effect of the vaccines on that front. We therefore are better safe than sorry and should do everything we can to protect ourselves and those around us.  Here's what I think you should know:  First, this Omicron ""variant"" is a new form of the COVID-19 virus, which causes a new wave of infections because it's somehow more potent than the previous variant. Omicron is both more contagious than previous variants (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta) and also escapes from the ""immunity"" the antibodies induced from the previous variants.   Omicron can infect people who have already been infected with previous variants and even those who were vaccinated several months ago. Moreover, Omicron is equally ""pathogenic"" as previous variants — i.e., it can cause serious disease leading to hospitalization, intense care, or even death.  As you know, our healthcare systems are currently still over-burdened by COVID-19 patients in hospitals and intensive-care wards. I hear that's the case for our local hospital and also for the one in Geneva. As a result, seriously ill people without COVID-19 but with cancer or other life-threatening conditions often have to wait for treatment.  That delay of necessary care for non-COVID-19 patients also causes unnecessary fear, suffering, and premature death. The ""Delta wave"" is now receding, but the ""Omicron wave"" is already unfolding with the overload of hospitals with COVID-19 patients and delays for non-COVID-19 care. You may have heard Dr. Anthony Fauci is predicting the same in the US.  (I have known of Dr. Fauci since I was researching HIV in the 1980s. He's an incredible scientist with a resume in infectious diseases that's equal to none. When he speaks, we should all listen.)  So what can we do together to avoid or certainly reduce the Omicron wave? Omicron remains sensitive to the vaccine, but less than Delta. That's why you need a third dose of the vaccine to help protect you from serious illness and hospitalization. Unfortunately, even three doses don't protect against the infection itself. If you've been vaccinated three times and still become infected, you'll often hardly notice it: You may have a ""common cold,"" a sore throat, and sometimes a fever. So I know you're all lining up for your boosters and you're doing the right thing.  Sometimes you don't feel anything at all and yet the virus is in your body for a few days and can be transmitted to other people. If you then infect someone who hasn't been vaccinated or who is vaccinated but is weakened, that person can become seriously ill with COVID-19. Not only very frail or old people are sensitive, but also middle-aged people with obesity, high blood pressure, chronic bronchitis, and diabetes, and even some apparently perfectly healthy youngsters or even children. A third shot of the vaccine is therefore important to protect yourself against disease. But even if you get a third shot, you can still transmit the Omicron virus and possibly make someone else ill. That's why we should all stick to the measures below because we know they greatly reduce the spread of each variant of the virus: Keep your distance and wear a face mask correctly when you're indoors with people who don't belong to your core family: at school, in the office, in a shop, on the public transport, in the town hall, and so on. Constantly ventilate rooms where you're together with many people with fresh air. You can do so by opening a window at home or by installing an air purifier (they're sold online and in many shops).  Wash your hands regularly. Definitely don't cough or sneeze in front of others, and make sure to keep your mask on when you speak. Sneezing, coughing, or speaking loudly to someone are the three most likely ways in which virus particles can spread and infect others.  If any of you have had close contact with an infected person, the rules of testing and quarantine (isolating yourself for one to two weeks) absolutely apply. That's also the case if any of the kids or your partners are infected. I know you'll have a lot of social contacts, so please be careful and follow those best practices.  As we will soon see each other for the holidays, it's not always possible to strictly follow all these rules. For example, if we're going to eat and drink together, you can't always wear your face mask and socially distance if you're in a small room.  Then it's really recommended that all people who plan to come together (including the children) do a self-test beforehand to make sure that no one would unknowingly become infected with the virus and spread it. This is very important if there are people who are old or weak — then everyone should certainly be tested.  (Your mom and I don't consider ourselves old and weak, but we're now in our late sixties and early seventies, so we have to be careful, too, and we'll get tested tomorrow ahead of the Christmas get-together.)  It's all annoying, but we live in a period when a dangerous virus is among us. It will remain that way all winter. What then is the prospect? The major vaccine companies are already working on a new vaccine specifically against Omicron. It could be ready as early as March and distributed shortly afterwards. We can be confident that the situation in the summer of 2022 will improve, just like in 2020 and 2021. That means we have something positive to look forward to in the near future. Because more and more people have been vaccinated and/or infected, the herd immunity (the resistance of all people through their antibodies) increases.  The virus can't endlessly create new strong variants, so it will eventually weaken and behave more like the flu virus. This pandemic will pass, just like the Spanish Flu a hundred years ago, but no one can predict when. I hope with all of you that this is our last COVID-19 winter, but I'm only a doctor and a scientist — and a father and grandfather — not a prophet … Take care, and let's hope we can still get together for the holidays, albeit extremely carefully,   Dad  Guido Vanham, medical doctor and specialist in virology and immunology Read the original article on Business Insider",Health/Business Insider,Read the letter a virologist sent his family on how to best protect themselves from the Omicron variant,https://news.yahoo.com/read-letter-virologist-sent-family-164207848.html

12/24/2021,"By Hyonhee Shin SEOUL (Reuters) -Senior South Korean diplomats held talks with Chinese counterparts on Thursday after a diplomatic spat with Taiwan over Seoul's cancellation of an invitation to a senior Taipei official to take part in a business forum last week. Vice Foreign Minister Choi Jong-kun and aides conducted an online meeting on Thursday with a team led by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng, the first such talks since June 2017. The sides discussed efforts to reopen stalled denuclearisation talks with North Korea, as well as Beijing's preparations to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, Yonhap news agency reported, citing South Korea's foreign ministry. Choi reiterated that Seoul hopes the Olympics will be successful, the ministry said, without elaborating on any discussions of attendance by South Korean officials. South Korea's presidential Blue House has said it is not considering participating in a U.S.-led diplomatic boycott https://www.reuters.com/world/china/australia-joins-diplomatic-boycott-beijing-winter-games-2021-12-08 of the Beijing Olympics, but that discussions had yet to be held with China on sending a delegation.

""We hope this meeting can have a positive effect on enhancing communication and mutual trust and the promotion of bilateral relations,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular press briefing ahead of the talks on Thursday. The meeting came at a delicate time as Taiwan has lodged a protest over South Korea's revocation of its invitation sent in September for Digital Minister Audrey Tang to speak virtually at a conference last week in Seoul. China claims the democratically governed island of Taiwan as its own territory and has sought to isolate it diplomatically abroad, stepping up pressure to assert its sovereignty claims. Taipei's foreign ministry called South Korea's cancellation of Tang's visit ""rude"" and summoned South Korea's acting de facto ambassador to express its displeasure. An official at Seoul's presidential Blue House said on Wednesday that the meeting organisers cancelled the invitation in line with ""our diplomatic principles, not because of China"". ""Our position remains unchanged that we will continue promoting unofficial economic and cultural relations (with Taiwan), and practical exchanges through them,"" the official told reporters.

12/24/2021,"Vladimir Putin’s normally predictable annual press conference briefly veered off the rails Thursday when the Russian president appeared to lose his cool after being questioned about Moscow’s aggression in Ukraine. When a reporter for Sky News asked whether Moscow could give security guarantees and promise not to invade its neighbor, Putin exploded: “You are demanding guarantees from us? It’s you who should give us guarantees. Immediately. Right now. And not talk it over for decades.” His comments came as Ukraine released satellite images it said showed more Russian forces building up at its border, and the Russian Defense Ministry announced massive “attack” drills in Crimea. Moscow has repeatedly claimed the moves are in response to what it sees as the threat of an expanding NATO, while Western officials view the Kremlin’s saber-rattling as a form of coercive diplomacy through which it hopes to keep its grip on Ukraine. Putin repeatedly portrayed Russia as the victim at his press conference, claiming Moscow had been dragged into the Ukraine conflict when it is really just a “mediator.” “They want to make us a party to the conflict, and it’s not like that,” he said. (Apparently in his view it was not the Russian forces seizing Crimea in 2014, the years of Kremlin propaganda, Russian support for separatists, and the reported weapons supplies that made Russia a party to the conflict.) He accused NATO of being the true aggressor, appearing to briefly seethe as he suggested the West has always sought to destroy Russia. “They tricked us. Just cheated us. Five waves of NATO enlargement,” he said. “And on top of that—no matter what we did, you always expressed ‘concerns.’ Get out of here with your ‘concerns.’ We will do what we consider necessary. We want to ensure our safety,” he said. Later in the conference, Putin said there was an overall “positive response” from the U.S. to the Kremlin’s “red line” proposals on NATO. “Our American partners say they’re ready to start discussions early next year in Geneva. Both sides have named representatives and I hope that things will continue along the same path,” he said. “Our actions will depend on the situation in the sphere of security. We made clear that the further expansion of NATO in the East is not acceptable. We’re not the ones who came to the States with missiles. They’re the ones setting up missiles right on our doorstep,” he said. “And what if we set up missiles on the border of the U.S. and Canada? Or Mexico?” Visibly angry, he went on to vent frustration over the idea of a sovereign Ukraine, suggesting the country actually belongs to Vladimir Lenin. “And who did California belong to?” he asked, apparently referring to California being part of Mexico prior to the Mexican-American War. “And Texas? Did they forget that or something? Well okay, everyone has forgotten, and they don’t remember the way they now remember about Crimea. We also don’t remember who created Ukraine–Lenin Vladimir Ilyich, when he created the Soviet Union.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

12/24/2021,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israel Antiquities Authority announced Wednesday the discovery of remnants of two shipwrecks off the Mediterranean coast, replete with a sunken trove of hundreds Roman and medieval silver coins. The finds made near the ancient city of Caesarea were dated to the Roman and Mamluk periods, around 1,700 and 600 years ago, archaeologists said. They include hundreds of Roman silver and bronze coins dating to the mid-third century, as well as more than 500 silver coins from the Middle Ages found amid the sediment. They were found during an underwater survey conducted by the IAA's Marine Archaeology Unit in the past two months, said Jacob Sharvit, head of the unit. Among the other artifacts recovered from the site near the ancient city of Caesarea were figurines, bells, ceramics, and metal artifacts that once belonged to the ships, such as nails and a shattered iron anchor. The IAA made its announcement just days ahead of Christmas, and underscored the discovery of a Roman gold ring, its green gemstone carved with the figure of a shepherd carrying a sheep on his shoulders. Robert Kool, head of the authority's coin department, called the item “exceptional.” “On the gemstone is engraved an image of the ‘Good Shepherd,’ which is really one of the earliest symbols of Christianity,” he said. Sharvit said that the Roman ship is believed to have originally hailed from Italy, based on the style of some of the artifacts.

12/24/2021,"Marjorie Taylor Greene owns stock in three major vaccine makers, financial-disclosure filings show. Greene holds AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson stock, each worth between $1,000 and $15,000. Greene has boasted about being unvaccinated and slammed ""vaccine Nazis"" last month. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has boasted about being unvaccinated against COVID-19, owns stock in three major vaccine makers, financial-disclosure filings analyzed by Insider show. Greene holds stock in AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, each worth between $1,000 and $15,000, according to an August 13, 2020, filing from Greene with the clerk of the House of Representatives. The discovery was made as part of Insider's Conflicted Congress project, which revealed that multiple US lawmakers held stock in vaccine makers as the pandemic raged in 2020. The project found that at least 13 senators and 35 US representatives held shares in Johnson & Johnson, 11 senators and 34 representatives held shares in Pfizer, and two representatives or their spouses held shares of Moderna. In September, Greene told Insider: ""I have an independent investment advisor that has full discretionary authority on my accounts. I do not direct any trades."" Despite her financial interest in vaccine stocks, Greene says she isn't vaccinated and has decried those trying to make her get the shot. In an episode of Steve Bannon's ""War Room"" podcast released November 2, Greene said ""vaccine Nazis"" were ""ruining our country."" The issue of Greene's vaccine assets has been seized on by Jennifer Strahan, who is running against her for Congress in Georgia's 14th district. Last week Strahan held a Twitter poll in which she asked, ""Which of the following COVID vaccine manufacturers does @mtgreenee currently own stock in?"" She listed AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, or ""all of the above"" as choices. ""For those of you wondering, the correct answer is D! Our current representative rails against the vaccine, but owns stock in 3 of the 4 major vaccine manufacturers,"" Strahan wrote in a follow-up tweet. Speaking at Turning Point USA's ""AmericaFest"" conference on Sunday, Greene reiterated her disdain for vaccines.

12/24/2021,"SAN DIEGO (AP) —  A California woman who punched a flight attendant in the face during a flight, breaking her teeth, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a federal charge, authorities said. Vyvianna Quinonez, 28, of Sacramento, entered a plea to interfering with a flight attendant, the U.S. attorney's office said.  Quinonez was on a May 23 Southwest Airlines flight from Sacramento to San Diego when a flight attendant asked her to buckle her seatbelt, stow her tray table and wear her mask properly during the descent.  Instead, Quinonez began recording the attendant on her cellphone, pushed her, then stood up and punched the woman in the face and grabbed her hair before other passengers intervened, authorities said.  The assault was recorded on another passenger's cellphone. The plea agreement says that the flight attendant suffered three chipped teeth, two of which needed crowns, along with bruises and a cut under her left eye that needed stitches. “The flight attendant who was assaulted was simply doing her job to ensure the safety of all passengers aboard the plane,” acting United States Attorney Randy Grossman said in the statement. “It’s inexcusable for anyone to use violence on an airplane for any reason.” The incident marked an escalation in unruly behavior by airline passengers and led the president of the flight attendants’ union to ask for more federal air marshals on planes. Quinonez will be sentenced in March in San Diego federal court. She could face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. However, prosecutors said they probably will recommend a sentence of four months in custody and six months of home confinement, KGTV-TV reported. Airlines reported more than 5,000 incidents of unruly passengers to the Federal Aviation Administration this year.  Most of the incidents have involved passengers refusing to follow the federal requirement for passengers to wear face masks while on planes, but nearly 300 have involved intoxicated passengers, according to the FAA.",U.S./Associated Press,Californian pleads guilty to punching attendant on flight,https://news.yahoo.com/californian-pleads-guilty-punching-attendant-005148033.html
12/24/2021,"Madelyn Allen was found Saturday naked and covered in coal dust after being missing for five days. A judge held the suspect, Brent Brown, without bail during his first court appearance Wednesday. Brown is charged with kidnapping and rape. He told investigators the encounter was consensual. The man accused of kidnapping and raping Madelyn Allen, a 19-year-old college student in Utah, was denied a request to spend Christmas with his family during his first court appearance on Wednesday. Brent Brown, 39, was arrested on Saturday after police found Allen in his basement, naked and covered in coal dust, the indictment obtained by Insider said. He was charged with six felonies, including rape, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault, and obstructing justice. In Brown's court appearance on Wednesday, Judge Wallace Lee of Utah's Sixth District Court asked him whether he wanted to comment before Lee determined whether he'd receive bail. Brown told the judge that he'd ""like to be home for Christmas,"" local FOX13 reported. He added, ""I don't get to see my kids."" The judge determined that Brown be held without bail, citing that Brown was wanted in connection with a separate felony in another county, court records showed. Brown also received a court-appointed attorney during the hearing. Madelyn Allen, a student at Snow College in Ephraim, Utah, went missing on December 13 after leaving her apartment for a date with someone she'd met online, authorities said. Her parents became concerned the following morning when one of them received a text from her that ""expressed Madelyn's love for the parent but provided no additional details,"" the indictment said. They contacted Verizon for her phone records, which indicated that Allen was in Loa, Utah, 87 miles south of her campus. Police discovered text messages on Allen's phone with ""conversations of a violent sexual nature,"" the indictment said. Police initiated a search, eventually visiting a home where they encountered Brown. During a search of the home on December 18, they discovered Allen in the basement, hidden in a coal-storage area. The indictment said Allen and Brown met on the messaging platform Kik. Allen told investigators that Brown held her against her will, sexually assaulted her, and threatened her family, the indictment said. Brown told investigators he had sex with Allen on multiple occasions, but that it had been consensual and part of a kidnapping role-play. Brown's attorney did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Allen's family said on Sunday that they were ""overjoyed"" that Allen had been found, KSL reported. ""She is a fighter. She is now a survivor,"" Allen's uncle said. A spokesperson for the Allen family declined to answer specific questions about Brown's Wednesday court appearance, but said the family is now resting and focusing on their daughter's care, as well as their other children. ""Words cannot express our gratitude for the outpouring of love we have received.

12/24/2021,"ST. PETERSBURG — Last week I was exposed to COVID-19. I had a group of friends over for dinner before everyone left for the holidays. Everyone was fully vaccinated and symptom-free, so we thought we were in the clear. The next morning, one guest tested positive. As the highly contagious omicron variant spreads across the state, it’s a situation that Floridians will face over the holiday season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines an exposure as being within 6 feet of an infected individual for more than 15 minutes. So sitting next to an infected dinner guest for hours, as I did, definitely counts as an exposure. Here are some steps that you can take to avoid exposure and what you can do if you’ve been exposed. The good news, according to public health experts, is that you can still see friends and family this holiday season while minimizing your risk of exposure. Some precautions may be inconvenient, but far less so than the steps you’ll have to take after you learn you’ve been exposed. I took some steps to avoid exposure, but experts I spoke to said I could have done better. Everyone at dinner was fully vaccinated and symptom-free, and we left the windows open to increase airflow indoors. I had recently received my booster shot, which experts say offers the best protection against omicron. But being indoors was itself a problem, said Dr. Nishant Anand, executive vice president and chief medical officer for BayCare Health System. “If you think of it on a sliding scale, the riskiest thing is to be indoors without a mask,” he said. “It does help whenever there are windows open and fans blowing to cycle the air out.” He added: “Especially with the weather as nice as it is, I think it’s a much better idea for people to gather outside whenever they can.” Our dinner was Sunday, Dec. 19. One guest, who was from out of town, tested negative for the coronavirus the day before our dinner. But he was the one who ended up positive less than 48 hours later. Going from negative to fully symptomatic in just two days would have seemed impossible with the previous variants, but it’s going to be a regular occurrence with omicron, said Céline Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at the New York University School of Medicine. “The original variants had an incubation period of something like four to five days,” Gounder said. “With omicron it’s two to three days.” That means people have to get tested more frequently in order to catch an infection, she said. “With omicron, you’re probably looking at testing at least daily, particularly in high-risk settings.” Experts suggested taking a rapid antigen test every morning if you’re planning on being in close contact with people outside your immediate household. Even with all those precautions, it’s inevitable that Floridians will be exposed to someone who contracts COVID-19. Here’s what experts say you should do next: “The first thing to do, obviously, is contact tracing,” said University of South Florida immunologist Michael Teng. “People need to know that they’ve been exposed so they can get tested and start monitoring for symptoms.” That means you have to contact those you were in close contact with and let them know you were exposed to COVID-19, whether you’re experiencing symptoms and when you got tested. Don’t rely on the government’s contact tracing. The Tampa Bay Times reported in October on the problems with the state’s contact tracing program, which spent millions telling infected people to call and warn those they were in contact with. Teng suggests checking temperature regularly and using a fingertip oximeter to measure blood oxygen saturation. A change in temperature or oxygen saturation can often indicate an infection before you’d see the results of an at-home antigen test, Teng said. Letting others know that they’ve been exposed is especially important at this time of year, when more people may be traveling to visit friends and family. “It’s incredibly easy to spread this variant,” the immunologist said, “so you need to know if you’re at risk of infection.” If you’ve had an infected individual in your home, Anand said, it’s essential to wipe down surfaces with an antiviral cleaning agent. And you need to go back to washing your hands frequently, in case you’ve been slacking on that. Household products like Lysol, Clorox, and a diluted solution of bleach work well for killing any virus particles left behind, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. “We know that most infections come from airborne particles,” Teng said. “The best way to avoid contact with virus (particles) that you pick up from surfaces … is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.” Once you’re exposed, experts said, the most important thing is to make sure you don’t spread the virus to others. The CDC recommends that fully vaccinated individuals should isolate for 10 days after an exposure, but that time period soon may be reduced. After that period of isolation, if you’re symptom-free and test negative, you should be in the clear. During isolation, assume that you’re infected and can spread the virus to others. “It takes time for symptoms and tests to emerge as positive,” Gounder said. But you still can spread the virus to others before you feel ill or test positive. “If you need to go out and get food or run to the drugstore, that’s fine,” she said. “But keep it to essential activities, not going out to the bar on Friday with my friends.” And when you do go out, it’s essential to wear a mask to curb the potential that you might spread the virus to others. “You need to wear a higher-grade mask, at bare minimum a surgical mask,” Gounder said. N95 or KN95 type masks are the gold standard, especially for omicron, because “cloth masks just don’t cut it,” she said. Don’t let the prospect of a positive result keep you from getting tested. Even the best COVID tests have some degree of uncertainty, “but not testing means your uncertainty level is 100 percent,” said Teng. Don’t be embarrassed to tell others if you do test positive, and remember to be kind to someone who tells you that they might have been exposed. If someone tested positive and told you, Teng said, it means they care about you. “That should be your takeaway, not that they brought COVID into your house,” he said. “They didn’t know they were infected and now they do. By telling you, they’re trying to protect you.” Editor’s note: Ian Hodgson covers the COVID-19 pandemic for the Times.

12/24/2021,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi authorities say they have identified the remains of a woman found following a tip from an inmate prior to his execution last month.  The woman has been identified as 40-year-old Felicia Cox, who disappeared in 2007, said John Weddle, who is the district attorney for several northern Mississippi counties. Her body was found on land that had once belonged to her family in Pontotoc County, Mississippi. In a post on Facebook Wednesday afternoon, Weddle said authorities were able to identify Felicia Cox by matching her DNA with her daughter, Amber Miskelly. Miskelly was 18 when her mother went missing. He said authorities expect autopsy results within the next two weeks. Felicia Cox's remains were discovered on Dec. 12 following a tip from inmate David Neal Cox, who became the first inmate executed in Mississippi in nine years when he was put to death last month. David Neal Cox was executed on Nov. 17 for killing his estranged wife, Kim Kirk Cox, and sexually assaulting her young daughter as her mother lay dying. Cox pleaded guilty in 2012 to capital murder for the May 2010 shooting death. He also pleaded guilty to multiple other charges, including sexual assault. David Neal Cox had dropped his appeals, filing court papers calling himself “worthy of death” before the state Supreme Court set his execution date. Questions had remained about whether David Neal Cox was responsible for the July 2007 disappearance of Felicia Cox, his brother’s wife. Miskelly recently told WTVA-TV that David Cox was the last person to see her mother alive. Before his Nov. 17 execution, David Neal Cox told his attorneys he killed Felicia Cox in 2007, providing detailed instructions on where investigators could find her remains and waiving his attorney-client privilege after death, Weddle announced during a press conference earlier this month. The information was presented to Weddle’s office two days after Cox’s execution, the district attorney said. David Neal Cox had been a longtime suspect in his sister-in-law’s disappearance, he said. In a post to his official Facebook page following the discovery of the remains, Weddle thanked Felicia Cox's family, the investigators, archaeologists, anthropologists and others who helped spearhead the search.  “We are thankful the family can now begin the process of giving Felicia Cox a burial,” he said. ",U.S./Associated Press,Remains identified after Mississippi man's pre-execution tip,https://news.yahoo.com/remains-identified-mississippi-mans-pre-152907920.html
12/24/2021,"An unexpected plus of a girlfriend sleepover: My bestie gave me a few pumps of magnesium oil to rub into my feet before getting into bed, and I drifted off, fast. I didn’t think much of it until a few days later when I had a massage and spied my bodyworker mix a few pumps of magnesium oil onto my neck and shoulders. Then, doing my wellness writer due diligence (i.e. searching social media), I discovered #magnesiumoil has more than 34,000 mentions on Instagram. What gives? I decided to investigate this sudden gusher of magnesium oil—while undertaking my own nightly pre-bed ritual at home. RELATED: I Spend Two Weeks Trying to Perfect My Sleep Routine, and I Highly Recommend You Do the Same Magnesium oil is oil that’s infused with micro-particles of flaked mineral magnesium, a bio-nutrient with widespread undiagnosed deficiencies in the population. According to a 2018 study in the medical journal Open Heart, due to processed foods, decreases in food crop nutrient levels, medications and chronic diseases, the vast majority of people in modern societies are at risk for magnesium deficiency, and this deficiency should be considered a public health crisis. (Move over Vitamin D.) That’s because magnesium is found in every cell in your body, and it plays a role in brain function, bowel movement, muscle movement, energy and sleep, according to sports nutritionist Shawn Wells. So, now that I have your attention, how do you make sure to have your recommended daily 310 milligrams of this important mineral? The best way, according to medical professionals (and it must be said, moms everywhere) is to eat your leafy green vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds. But that adds up to approximately 4 or 5 servings of freshly steamed spinach, baked potato with skin, edamame and…frankly I’m going to just come clean here and confess many days I maybe only get one serving. And while I don’t seem to have many of the early signs of profound magnesium deficiency, which according to the National Insitutes of Health are “non-specific and include loss of appetite, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and weakness,” let’s just say the condition is now on my radar. Besides pounding whole foods, you can supplement your dietary intake with popular nutrient drinks like Athletic Greens or Moon Juice Magnes-Om, but it’s the pre-bedtime foot rub I was curious about. There’s a home ritual that bath addicts such as myself have undertaken for years—soaking in a hot bathtub filled with Epsom salts, which are crystallized magnesium and sulfate that are named for the mineral springs in England where they were popularized. While it’s a home remedy for stress and muscular aches, has it ever been scientifically proven to absorb into the body’s tissue or bloodstream? Not according to the NIH. But still, I exercise, and I soak. Just like with transdermal absorption of magnesium flakes in water, there’s no scientific proof that magnesium oil rubbed onto the epidermis actually penetrates the skin. However, a 2017 NIH paper recommends further study of magnesium creams on a larger population than the small studies that have been done so far, since “magnesium might be able to get into the lymphatic system beneath the dermis and enter the circulatory system, bypassing the regulation through the GI tract and hereby increasing serum magnesium.” So, that’s a big “unclear” from the scientific community; however, my anecdotal use—massaging a couple pumps of oil on my feet before sleeping—has been a big win. Is it the relaxing manipulation of muscle that’s sending me to sleep fast? Or, as reflexology would explain it, am I sleeping better because I am releasing blocked chi? Am I just having a happy moment of self-care, so “centering myself” per all those meditation apps I’ve tried, then abandoned? The cause of my fast sleep isn’t so easy to pinpoint, but let’s just say my feet are more supple and soft than ever before thanks to the oil, and I’m sleeping like a baby. (A baby that’s getting all her magnesium.) Lavender and arnica oil make this smell good and super-power muscle aches. Buy It ($38) Mandarin orange adds a light scent and there’s valerian and antioxidant superberry amla for added soothing.

12/24/2021,"By Maria Tsvetkova and Anton Zverev MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian mercenaries have deployed to separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine in recent weeks to bolster defences against Ukrainian government forces as tensions between Moscow and the West rise, four sources have told Reuters. In recent weeks, Russia has moved tens of thousands of regular troops to staging posts closer to Ukraine and followed up by demanding urgent security guarantees from the West designed, Moscow says, to prevent Ukraine and other neighbouring countries being used as a base to attack it. The West and Ukraine have for their part accused Russia of weighing a fresh attack on its southern neighbour as soon as next month, something Moscow denies. Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and backed pro-Russian separatists who seized a swathe of the industrial Donbass region of eastern Ukraine that same year, and continue to fight Ukrainian government forces there. Of four sources, three described their offers from mercenary recruiters to go to Donbass. They said the recruiters did not disclose who they represented. All four sources declined to be named, citing fears for their safety. Two of the three sources said they had accepted; the third said he had refused. ""There is a full house. They are gathering everybody with combat experience,"" said one of the two who accepted. He said he had previously fought in Ukraine and Syria for groups of Russian security contractors whose operations have been closely aligned with Russia's strategic interests. He declined to identify the contractors. The fighter said he was planning to join up with fellow mercenaries on the Russian side of the border with the separatist-held Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin says it has nothing to do with private Russian military contractors whose operatives it describes as volunteers with no connection to the state. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: ""It's the first we've heard of this and we don't know how reliable these assertions are."" Peskov said there were no Russian regular forces or military advisers in eastern Ukraine and never had been, and that Moscow was not considering sending any. Kyiv disputes that and says regular Russian army forces are present. SPECIAL TRAINING Alexander Ivanov, head of the Community of Officers For International Security, a non-governmental group representing Russian contractors in the Central African Republic, said he had ""not a single confirmation"" that any Russian mercenary had been deployed to Ukraine. Three of the sources said they were not aware of any plans for a new Russian attack on Ukraine or of preparations that would suggest one was coming. One of the sources, a contractor who has taken part in Russian operations abroad and had already arrived in eastern Ukraine, said the deployment was for defensive purposes. The first mercenary said the same. Another source said he was not directly involved in the deployment, but was in touch with people on the ground who were undergoing special training. He said the aim of the deployment was what he called sabotage activities to undermine stability in Ukraine. The Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) proclaimed its independence from Ukraine in 2014 after separatist fighters took control of a slice of eastern Ukraine. Backed by Russia, its self-proclaimed status has not been recognised internationally. Alexander Borodai, ex-prime minister of the DPR and head of the Union of Donbass Volunteers, said his organisation was not involved in the recruitment of any mercenaries for eastern Ukraine. Members of his organisation have previously fought in Ukraine and Syria. ""If and when it's needed, we'll call people - but there has been no call for now,"" said Borodai, who is also a lawmaker for Russia's ruling party, United Russia. Separatist spokesperson Eduard Basurin said he knew nothing of any recent Russian deployments of security contractors to eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's military intelligence service declined to comment, while the state security service did not reply to a request for comment.

12/24/2021,"China is threatened Lithuania over its strengthening relationship with Taiwan. The tiny European nation allowed Taiwan to open an office in its capital, Vilnius. Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own, reacted furiously and downgraded relations with Lithuania. China threatened to consign the tiny European state of Lithuania to ""the garbage bin of history"" after it defied Beijing by allowing Taiwan to open a representative office in the capital of Vilnius. Lithuania, which has a population of 3 million, broke from its European neighbors by formally recognizing Taiwan, a self-governing island that China claims belongs to it. In August, Lithuania said it would allow Taiwan to open an office in its own name, prompting fury from Beijing, which recalled its ambassador to Lithuania in response. It also downgraded diplomatic relations with Lithuania. In recent years, the prospect has loomed large of China invading Taiwan to take it by force, escalating its decades-long economic and diplomatic dispute with the nation. A report in the Global Times, a Chinese state-run newspaper, said that Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters this week that ""Lithuania stands on the opposite side of universal principles, which will never end well."" Zhao also warned that ""those who insist on acting in collusion with Taiwan secessionist forces will eventually be swept into the garbage bin of history."" Taiwan opened the representation office in Vilnius in November, which Lithuania agreed would bear the name Taiwan rather than Chinese Taipei. Many other countries and international organizations refer to Taiwan by that name to avoid offending Beijing. China refuses to give diplomatic recognition to countries that characterize Taiwan as independent. Just 15 countries have a formal diplomatic alliance as a result of this pressure from China. Lithuania may pay a heavy economic price for its decision. The country is bracing for a corporate boycott after China told multinationals to sever ties with Lithuania or risk being shut out of the lucrative Chinese market, Reuters reported in December. The Global Times report said Lithuania had become increasingly economically dependent on China in recent years. It suggested that trade between the two countries would decrease in future.

12/24/2021,"Inspired mostly by curiosity, a couple of weeks ago I clicked on an invitation to join Donald Trump’s new social media app, called Truth Social. It’s being promoted as a “Big Tent social media platform that encourages an open, free, and honest global conversation without discriminating against political ideology.” I dutifully filled in all the blanks on the form — name, address, phone number, email — until I got to the part that asked me to click on the amount that I wanted to donate. The boxes started at $35 and went all the way up to $10,000. (According to the fine print, donations go to the National Republican Senatorial Committee.) On account of my job, I don’t donate to politicians or political causes. Nor do I sign petitions. Some of the newspaper colleagues I’ve worked with over the years don’t even vote — at least not for the people they write about — because they believe that would compromise their ability to be objective in their reporting. So, no, I wasn’t about to pay to join the inner circle of Truth Socializers — especially since it costs nothing to sign up for the waiting list for the app, which is expected to start up the first quarter of 2022. I declined to enter a credit card number, closed the form, and naively figured that would be the end of it. Boy was I wrong. The Trump machine doesn’t give up; in fact, its performance is even more impressive than those telemarketers warning us that our Social Security number has been hacked. (Don’t believe that. It’s a scam.) Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve been getting as many as seven texts per day — all on my personal phone — from team Trump. Here’s a sample: “WOW. Don’t ignore Trump’s PERSONAL message, Stephanie. We NEED you to step up to save our nation from Biden’s presidency.” “Stephanie, don’t make us tell Trump you’re IGNORING his dinner invitation. There’s still time. Enter to win.” “Why haven’t you taken the Election Year Poll? Are you becoming a Democrat?” “Stephanie, you STILL didn’t sign Trump’s Christmas card!” “Stephanie, have you ABANDONED Trump? Fix your reputation.” “It’s Don Jr.: I told my father he could count on YOUR support to restore his Majority in 2022. Contribute here.” “It’s Ted Cruz: We are just ONE SEAT away from taking back the GOP Majority.” “Stephanie, we need 82 more responses from your area — take our election year poll HERE. “CONGRATS! Stephanie we extended your chance to WIN a set of Melania Trump’s White House ornaments! Enter in the next 15 MIN.” As you probably guessed, a donation was required in order to take the poll, sign Trump’s Christmas card or have a chance to win Melania’s ornaments, which, I’m told, are the EXACT ornaments that hung in the Trump White House. But hey, I was able to gain access to an EXCLUSIVE video for TOP PATRIOTS. It turned out to be a brief message from Trump himself, thanking his audience for their love, affection and respect and promising the GOP would take back the Senate, the House and the White House “sooner than you think.” “The Republican Party is stronger than it’s ever been and it’s going to be a lot stronger than it is right now,” Trump says in the “exclusive” video. That’s pretty much it. Not even a Merry Christmas or a Happy New Year. Just more posturing. If this is a preview of Truth Social, so much for the promise of a Big Tent. So much for encouraging open, free and honest conversation. So much for welcoming people of “all political stripes” and “all different viewpoints.” So sorry, Don Jr. You too, Ted. Despite your persistence, I won’t be signing up for those holiday ornaments or for an opportunity to add my name to Trump’s Christmas card. It’s been fun, but I’m going to have to break up.

Lee that formerly stood in Richmond, Virginia's capital. Conservators in a laboratory at the state's Department of Historic Resources opened the lead box after hours of meticulous scraping and drilling to reveal the almanac, two other unidentified books and a cloth envelope with unknown contents. A coin was stuck to one of the books. Historians had thought the box might be a time capsule containing about 60 objects that was placed in the statue pedestal on Oct. 27, 1887, according to a news release from Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's office. But Wednesday's discovery seemed to indicate it was a different capsule. The memorial to Lee was erected on Monument Avenue in Richmond, the capital of the pro-slavery Confederacy, a group of breakaway Southern states that fought against Union forces in the 1861-65 Civil War. The six-story-tall statue was removed from its base in September after a year-long legal battle. The monument, which activists say glorified the South's racist past, had been the focus of protests against racial injustice. Advocates of keeping Confederate monuments and symbols say they honor the Southern heritage and the sacrifices made by those who fought during the war. Northam, a Democrat, announced plans to remove the statue in June 2020, 10 days after a white Minneapolis policeman killed George Floyd, who was Black, sparking nationwide protests. Crews discovered the time capsule on Friday while disassembling the pedestal that formerly held the statue. The lead box was found about 20 feet (6 m) above the ground, encased in a 1,500-pound (680-kg) block of granite, according to the Department of Historic Resources.

12/24/2021,"BELVIDERE — ""This is not God's will. This was the evil of man."" Those were the words spoken by the Rev. David Smith of First Assembly of God Church in Belvidere. Smith led more than 50 people in prayer Tuesday evening at a vigil held in the 600 block of Union Avenue where family, friends and community members gathered outside of the home of Andrew Hintt. Hintt and his two sons, Benjamin, 7; and Sebastian, 5, were found deceased Sunday inside of his residence. All three had been shot. The Boone County Coroner's Office classified the deaths as homicides. Alize Smith: 'Person of interest' arrested, questioned in Belvidere triple homicide ""I can't tell you, 'It's not going to hurt,' Smith told the family. ""It's going to hurt for a while. But look around and remember. In the moment that it hurt the most, these people came out here to be beside you."" Kathy and Vernnon Hintt, Andrew's grandparents, said their great grandsons enjoyed playing soccer, basketball, Minecraft video games, and Legos. Belvidere homicide case: Belvidere man, 2 sons found slain ""They were good boys,"" he said. Vernnon said he was the last one to see boys alive as they were with him and other family members at his residence earlier on Sunday. His last words to the boys were, ""I love you."" ""They said, 'We love you too, Grandpa.'"" Andrew Hintt's aunt, Theresa Eileen, said she was 9 years old when Andrew was born. ""He was my birthday present,"" she said. More: Donations sought for funerals for father, sons killed in triple homicide in Belvidere Because of their closeness in age, Eileen said their relationship was one of more big sister and little brother than aunt and nephew. ""We hung out,"" she said. ""I used to try to scare him. I tried to flaunt my nine years. But he had a good sense of humor."" Eileen said Hintt was self-employed and owned and operated his own meat truck. When Hintt wasn't working, Eileen said Hintt was ""the best father."" ""He spoiled the heck out of his kids,"" she said. ""He would take them everywhere. He brought the boys their own (electric) dirt bikes. He taught them how to ride."" Hintt and his fiancee are the parents of five children. However, Benjamin and Sebastian lived with other relatives in the area. Eileen said Andrew had weekly visiting rights. Hintt's fiancee and the other three children, ages 3 and under, were in California at the time of the deaths. Eileen said the couple was in the process of moving to California and that they were hopeful the two oldest children would be able to join them and their siblings in the near future. ""They were just trying to start a new life, somewhere beautiful,"" she said. ""They both loved it out there. They had been out there for about a month looking for a place to live."" Officers found Hintt and his boys Sunday night in the Union Avenue home after the landlord called 911. Police said the landlord was contacted by the boys' mother after she failed to reach Andrew and had not heard from any other family members. Wednesday, police announced the arrest of 24-year-old Alize Smith of Huntley, who was identified early on in the investigation as a person of interest. Authorities said Alize was with Hintt and his boys that Sunday morning. U.S. Marshals Great Lakes Regional Task arrested Alize Tuesday on a warrant for parole violations. He is being held in the Boone County Jail without bond. It is unknown if officers are still searching for Hintt's vehicle, a silver or gray 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Trailhawk with Illinois registration: CT92923. Anyone with information about the crime or the whereabouts of the vehicle is asked to call the Belvidere Police Department at 815-544-2135 or Boone County Crime Stoppers at 815-547-7867. A GoFundMe account has been established to help the family with funeral expenses.

12/24/2021,"Cases of the omicron variant of COVID-19 have been rising, now accounting for 73% of new infections last week, federal health officials said Monday. Numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have shown nearly a six-fold increase in omicron’s share of infections in only one week. While the CDC says it's still unknown how rapidly omicron spreads as compared to the delta variant of the virus, it will likely spread more rapidly than the original strain of COVID-19. It's possible to get the omicron variant even if you're vaccinated, but you are less likely to experience severe illness, hospitalization and death, however, breakthrough infections are still likely to occur, according to the CDC. To help fight omicron, the CDC recommends everyone ages 5 and older be vaccinated, and everyone 18 and older to get a booster shot. Mask wearing indoors or in areas of high community transmission are also recommended. COVID-19: Omicron variant sweeping across nation, now accounts for 73% of new cases; Moderna 3rd dose effective vs. omicron: COVID-19 updates More: Yes, omicron has overtaken delta. No, it's not March 2020 Omicron, the 15th letter of the Greek alphabet, can be pronounced in a few ways, which are both correct. Merriam-Webster says you can either say ""AH-muh-krahn"" or ""OH-muh-krahn."" The World Health Organization, which chose omicron as the next variant name, picked it over 13th and 14th Greek alphabet letters nu and xi, because nu sounds like ""new"" and xi sounds like a common surname. There's still not a lot of information on the difference between symptoms of the omicron variant and other COVID-19 variants, if there are any, but the CDC recently released a briefing with the most commonly reported symptoms. They include: Cough. Fatigue. Congestion. Runny nose. Kids and vaccines: Holiday school break opens a window to get kids vaccinated Rapid tests: Biden to announce free rapid COVID-19 tests and help for overwhelmed hospitals amid omicron threat Symptoms may appear two to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms. Fever or chills. Cough. Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Fatigue. Muscle or body aches. Headache. New loss of taste or smell. Sore throat. Congestion or runny nose. Nausea or vomiting. Diarrhea. Are the symptoms between delta and previous variants any different? In short, it's not completely clear. COVID-19: The omicron variant is in the Cincinnati region. Now what? Like COVID-19, the symptoms are often: Coughing. Sneezing. Runny or stuffy nose. Sore throat. Tiredness. Sometimes a fever. Symptoms usually appear one to three days after exposure to a cold-causing virus. Unlike COVID-19, a cold is usually harmless and cold-sufferers generally recover in three to 10 days. The flu is different from a cold, and it can often come on suddenly, according to the CDC. Symptoms can include: Fever, or feeling feverish and chills. It is important to not that not everyone with the flu will have a fever. Cough. Sore throat. Runny or stuffy nose. Muscle or body aches. Headaches. Fatigue. Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, although its more common in children than adults. There are some key differences in symptoms. Currently, The Weather Channel's allergy tracker for Cincinnati is listed as ""none,"" with no grass, tree and ragweed pollen counts. Common allergy symptoms include: Runny nose. Sneezing. Red, swollen eyes. Itchy eyes. Itchy nose. Tickle in the throat. Rarely a fever.

12/24/2021,"MILAN (AP) — An archaeological dig in Sicily has uncovered traces of a lost World War II American heavy bomber shot down in 1943, and possible human remains that could lead to identification of five airmen whose bodies were never recovered. The six-week dig that ended this week was carried out by a team from the Pentagon’s Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, which locates and identifies missing U.S. military personnel around the world. The site near Sciacca was identified in 2017 by investigators using historical records and metal detectors. This year's dig uncovered wreckage “consistent only to a B-25 aircraft,’’ said archaeologist Clive Vella, the scientific director of the expedition, contributing to hopes that any confirmed remains would be linked to the missing crew. “We owe (their) families accurate answers,’’ Vella told the Associated Press Thursday. The North American B-25 Mitchell heavy bomber with a crew of six was one of 52 air losses with missing personnel in the area during WWII, mostly during 1943 as the Allies pushed into southeastern Sicily. It was shot down as it targeted a camouflaged German airstrip amid olive groves and pastureland on July 10, 1943. A German military report documented the crash of a U.S. aircraft about two kilometers (just over a mile) from the Sciacca airport, Vella said. One crew member was located immediately and buried in the town’s cemetery. The body was claimed in 1944 by U.S. military officials, but the other five airmen remained missing. In the intervening decades, the crash site “like most others in the Mediterranean region, was scavenged for metal, the land restored to its original use,’’ Vella said. “The scars of a crash were mostly gone.” The evidence, which includes possible human bones as well as potential remnants of the aircraft, has been transported to a laboratory in the U.S. for examination. Worldwide, there are more than 81,600 missing U.S. military personnel, including 72,350 from World War II, 7,550 from the Korean War and 1,584 from the Vietnam War. Over 41,000 of the total are presumed lost at sea.",World/Associated Press,"Possible relics of lost WWII US bomber, crew found in Italy",https://news.yahoo.com/possible-relics-lost-wwii-us-204920669.html
