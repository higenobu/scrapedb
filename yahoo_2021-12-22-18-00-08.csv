12/22/2021,"All In With Chris Hayes spent the first 15 minutes of Tuesday’s show condemning the celebration of Kyle Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges in the 2020 fatal shooting of two protesters and the injuring of another in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Since his acquittal, he has met with former president Donald Trump and experienced a meteoric rise in popularity among conservative pundits. Over the weekend, Rittenhouse was the featured guest at a Turning Point USA event in Phoenix, Arizona. He received a standing ovation from the crown in attendance when he walked on stage. “Kyle Rittenhouse, I mean he is known for one thing,” Hayes said. “They are literally celebrating killing people…I have to say, watching that tape of him walking out and the big cheering is one of the most ominous, despicable developments in our politics in recent memory, which is really saying something because, boy, we have been full of them.” While Hayes called out the right wing as a whole, he had some particularly harsh words for Tucker Carlson who has exalted Rittenhouse as an American hero. Carlson also dedicated a full hour of his top-rated cable show to an interview with Rittenhouse, as well as a separate documentary about his trial on Fox Nation. “To put the politics aside again, this is a sick, sick spectacle,” Hayes said. “I mean watching Tucker Carlson…like quiver and squeal in delight, you know, you are a grown ass man. Like, grow up. Grow up. You are a man and you're groveling at the foot of this kid because of the people he killed?” All In With Chris Hayes airs weeknights at 8 p.m. on MSNBC. See why Local doctor says 'we're in crisis here in Northeast Ohio' days after the state deploys its National Guard: On Anderson Cooper 360 Monday night, Dr. Brook Watts, the Chief Medical Officer at the MetroHealth System in Cleveland, Ohio, discussed the overwhelming crisis the state's hospitals are facing.
Following the issue of a simple, but powerful, ad in which a group of Ohio hospitals begged for ""help,"" Dr. Watts told John Berman, in for Anderson Cooper, ""We're in crisis here in Northeast Ohio,"" said Dr. Watts. ""I think the health systems, together, said it best this weekend, when we took out a joint ad with all hospitals in our region and it said one word. It said 'help.' It said help because our hospitals are filled with patients with COVID and we're struggling.""
On Monday it was also reported that the Omicron variant is now the most dominant strain in the U.S. and, just last week, as Ohio's COVID-19 case count hit its highest point in just over a year, the state deployed its National Guard to hospitals to help with staffing shortages.
""They will be coming into our Cleveland area to help offer access for testing. Right now, because we have so many COVID cases, there isn't a rapid test to be found, and the PCR tests that are offered generally at testing sites, the wait period is approximately seven days. So the National Guard will be helping us by setting up the testing site,"" explained Dr. Watts.
With a record-breaking amount of COVID patients in Ohio's hospitals, Dr. Watts also shared that the majority are unvaccinated and, surprisingly, young.
""We continue to see that most of our patients, particularly the patients in the ICUs, are unvaccinated,"" said Dr. Watts. ""I think what felt a little bit, perhaps, different for me this time having taken care of COVID patients since the beginning of the pandemic is I do feel like we are seeing more younger folks. There is nothing more heartbreaking than walking into a COVID patient's room, and seeing pictures of their young children. So, young parents.""
While it seems like Dr. Watts might be overwhelmed or scared during this time, she actually just said she feels exhausted. ""Last year, we were in a similar situation but we sure had a lot of hope that we were going to get to a better place. I just don't think any of us saw this coming. For us right now, most of the patients in the hospital still have the Delta variant, but as you mentioned in your intro, Omicron is coming on fast and strong and we are all sort of waiting to see what happens next. And I think that unknown and that fear is contributing to the exhaustion we are all feeling,"" said Dr. Watts.
