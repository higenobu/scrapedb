3/14/2022,"WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - Russia is showing signs of a willingness to engage in substantive negotiations over Ukraine, even as Moscow currently is intent on ""destroying"" its neighbor, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on Sunday, Sherman, in an interview with ""Fox News Sunday"", said the United States is putting ""enormous pressure"" on Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a cease-fire in its weeks-old invasion of Ukraine and to allow the creation of humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to escape. ""That pressure is beginning to have some effect. We are seeing some signs to have real, serious negotiations. But I have to say ... so far it appears Vladimir Putin is intent on destroying Ukraine,"" Sherman said. Following a Russian attack on a military base near Poland's border where NATO defenses are deployed, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said he did not believe a NATO-imposed no-fly zone over Ukraine would have prevented that. And he said that while a no-fly zone has a ""nice air policing sound,"" such a move by NATO would hurl the United States into war with Russia. ""There is very little that you can see that would make sense for this war to be escalated between two nuclear powers,"" Kirby told ABC's ""This Week."" (Reporting by Richard Cowan and Sarah N.

3/14/2022,"STORY: U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned Beijing that they would ""absolutely"" face consequences if it helped Moscow evade sweeping sanctions over the war in Ukraine. Sullivan’s comments come as he is due to meet with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome on Monday. In comments to CNN, Sullivan said that the United States believed China was aware that Russia was planning some action in Ukraine before the invasion took place - although Beijing may not have understood the full extent of what was planned. Now, according to Sullivan, Washington was watching closely to see to what extent Beijing provided economic or material support to Russia, and would impose consequences if that occurred. He added (quote): “We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world."" Meanwhile, Russia said on Sunday that it was counting on China to help it withstand the blow to its economy from Western sanctions. Western countries have imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia's corporate and financial system since it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it calls a 'special military operation.' Russia and China have tightened cooperation in recent times as both have come under strong Western pressure over human rights and a raft of other issues. Beijing has not condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine and does not call it an invasion, but it has urged a negotiated solution.",Politics/Reuters Videos,U.S. ‘will not allow’ lifeline to Russia -Sullivan,https://news.yahoo.com/u-not-allow-lifeline-russia-185734217.html
3/14/2022,"50 Cent has trolled Jussie Smollet after the former Empire actor made questionable comments when he was sentenced to 150 days in jail for staging a hate crime. The 39-year-old actor, who falsely reported a hate crime that he paid two men to commit on him in 2019, closed his case in dramatic fashion after his sentencing was announced this week. “I did not do this and I am not suicidal and if anything happens to me when I go there, I did not do it to myself and you must all know that,” said Smollett, who raised his voice as authorities escorted him out of the courtroom. “Your honor, I respect you and I respect your decision, but I did not do this and I am not suicidal. If anything happens to me when I go in there, I did not do it to myself, and you must all know that.” The moment raised a lot of eyebrows, especially in light of significant evidence indicating he recruited two men to stage the attack to invite public sympathy. 50 Cent had jokes for Smollett throughout the whole legal process, and he didn't want to miss another opportunity to troll the actor. ""If I ever go to court again, I don't care if it's for a parking ticket, I'm gonna say this,"" he joked alongside the video of Smollett's outburst. In another post on Instagram, Fif added, ""This fool is crazy, I knew he was lying from the beginning."" Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in Cook County Jail and 30 months of probation, and was ordered to pay restitution to the amount of $120,106 alongside a $25,000 fine. 8 Takeaways From The Game's ‘Drink Champs’ Interview 50 Cent Reacts to The Game Saying Kanye Has Done More for His Career Than Dr. Dre, Game Claps Back (UPDATE) Sha Money XL Responds to Wack 100's Claim That The Game Helped Write 50 Cent's ""What Up Gangsta"" The Complex SHOP: Designer Clothing and Brands Complex Podcast Network Sole Collector Mobile App - Your app for the Sneaker World Sneaker of the Year: The Best Since ’85 Book - Now available for pre-order!
