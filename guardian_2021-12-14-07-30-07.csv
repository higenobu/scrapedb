12/14/2021,"They’re trying to silence me! You can’t swim in the ocean! They changed the 389 Bondi bus timetable! Won’t somebody think of the property developers? Alan Jones, having lost his low-rating spot on Sky News and his regular rant in Sydney’s Daily Telegraph, is back with a new show called Direct to the People.  Jones began at 8pm on Monday night, thundering about being silenced. “You’re not allowed to have an alternative viewpoint,” he bellowed on YouTube, Facebook and his own website, while spruiking his new morning podcast. “They won’t silence you or me,” he continued. Alas, he was silenced. After a dramatic introduction to the strains of Laura Branigan’s Gloria, all three feeds sputtered to a halt about 2.45 minutes in. Jones’s online fans declared it a conspiracy of big tech. A post to his Facebook page said it was due to viewer demand. The YouTube ticker showed 1,778 people were tuning in. The one-time 2GB shock jock was back two hours later, and delivered about an hour of fanciful and often fact-free ruminations. On Covid: Only 2,000 people have died, there’s no proof lockdowns achieved anything, and you couldn’t swim in the ocean. On climate change: They’re going to mandate electric cars. On education: It’s “full of indoctrination”. On the Sydney ferries: There’s no air inside. On the 389 bus: “Out of the blue” it changed its route. On property: Red tape is stifling progress and you need to “emancipate” people to build more homes. Jones, freed of any obligations to civility or truth, said President Joe Biden “shouldn’t be allowed outside”, that Vice-President Kamala Harris was “unwanted by her own party”, and hinted that somehow 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton might end up in the top job. The overarching theme was familiar. Jones is the man to give voice to the mythical silent majority. He sketched out an imagined Ye Olde Australia, a land where men are free and the 389 bus route cannot be changed without his permission. He evoked nostalgia for this past where wealthy, high-profile Sydneysiders like him were free to say whatever they liked on the airwaves and be financially rewarded for it. The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, joined the show. He displayed a remarkable nimbleness, and managed to keep Jones cheering for him while not actually agreeing with some of his more outlandish claims. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Jones and the Queensland senator Matt Canavan, that reliable outlier, egged each other on to new heights of adoration of coal and fear-mongering about renewables. And then it was over, for now. At last glance, Direct to the People had racked up 5,500 YouTube views. After that stuttering start, Jones chose not to end with the song he began with: If everybody wants you, why isn’t anybody callin’? / You don’t have to answer / Leave them hangin’ on the line, oh oh oh, calling Gloria.",News/Media,"Alan Jones begins new live show with rant about being silenced, before being cut off",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/14/alan-jones-begins-new-live-show-with-rant-about-being-silenced-before-being-cut-off
12/14/2021,"Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Succession season three, which airs on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK. Do not read on unless you have watched episode nine. The gut-punch series finale saw the Roy siblings reunited before another biblical betrayal. Here’s your order of service from a rug pull-packed climactic episode, titled All the Bells Say …  Last week ended on a shattering cliffhanger as the clearly inebriated Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) submerged his face in a swimming pool and appeared to stop breathing. The Gatsby-esque moment hinted at the tragedy we’d been dreading all series. This week’s ambiguous opening scene teased us that the worst had indeed happened. Logan (Brian Cox) was reading Judith Kerr’s elegiac Goodbye Mog to his grandson Iverson and talking about Kendall in the past tense. Sighs of relief all round when he reappeared alive and well. Or as well as a hangdog husk of a man with a penance buzzcut can be. PR rep Comfrey (Dasha Nekrasova) had found “Kurt Cobain of the floaties” just in time. Kendall nearly drowned and was kept in hospital overnight but waved it off as “too many limoncellos, fell off an inflatable, no biggie”. Now he was talking to new lawyers about posting all the incriminating documentation on his Insta. “Let’s go see Hans Christian Anderfuck and see if he’s been telling us fairytales.” The goalposts had moved on Waystar’s bid to buy tech company GoJo since its CEO Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgård) decided he wanted a merger of equals. GoJo’s market cap had now overtaken Waystar’s and Matsson was weighing up other options. Logan and go-between Roman (Kieran Culkin) flew to his Swiss pile to salvage the deal. GoJo’s platform and Waystar’s content were a good fit, but Matsson played hardball: “We’re flying like a rocket ship, you’re sinking like a lead balloon.” Matsson proposed that he take over the newly merged firm. He’d let Logan retain the assets he loved. Roman would be “crucial to the integration process, the face of the family”. The rest of Waystar’s top team? Not so much. Logan couldn’t swallow this. However, he sent Roman back to his mother’s Tuscan nuptials while he stayed to discuss asset swaps and side-deals. Something was afoot. And since dick pic-gate, Roman was suddenly out of the loop. For the first time since episode two’s doughnut-interrupted chit-chat in Kendall’s daughter’s bedroom, all four siblings sat down together for pastries and pass-agg sniping. They told Kendall they were worried. Still denying he’d been suicidal, he said they had no right to stage an intervention when they all needed one too. Shiv (Sarah Snook) told Ken: “You’re addicted to booze, drugs, relationships, sex, work and the family drama.” Well, aren’t we all? Kendall replied: “Do you have any idea how it feels as the eldest son to be offered something, then have it taken away?” At which point, Connor (Alan Ruck) exploded. He was the eldest son, he repeatedly insisted. Besides, presidential wannabe Con was rattled by talk of the GoJo merger because Matsson wanted to “de-platform us maverick thinkers”. Going full Cameron-from-Ferris Bueller, he huffed off. We were still in Chiantishire for the swish wedding of Lady Caroline Alexandra Helena St John Collingwood (Harriet Walter) and Peter Timothy Mungo Munion (Pip Torrens) – possibly a gold-digger, certainly a social climber. Party gossip? Connor was convinced Logan was trying for a baby with PA Kerry (Zoë Winters), hence his nut-munching and super-smoothies. Greenpeace-suing Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun), now quite the ladies’ man, was playing off Comfrey and the Contessa (Ella Rumpf). Most juicily, Shiv and Roman got wind that Matsson’s financiers had landed in Switzerland. Mergers and acquisitions experts were in town, too. Waystar’s vice-chair Frank Vernon (Peter Friedman) and CFO Karl Muller (David Rasche) flew out to huddle up with Logan, who’d set up a war room – missing his ex’s wedding, much to unctuous Munion’s dismay. Roman admitted to Shiv that Matsson had floated the idea of buying out Waystar. Was a deal being done behind the siblings’ back? Full of white-hot fury, Shiv reached out to Kendall. Avengers assemble. “Will you make me the happiest man alive-slash-most bulletproof candidate in the world?” Connor was fretting on his still unanswered proposal to girlfriend Willa (Justine Lupe), wailing: “My family hates me, I’m gonna lose ATN to a Swede so my campaign is fucked, you’re gonna leave me and I love you.” Oh and he couldn’t get the air-con level right in their suite either. In an acceptance almost as romantic as the proposal, Willa said: “You know what? Fuck it. How bad can it be, right?” Con was cock-a-hoop. Weepy Willa regretted it almost immediately. The three siblings gathered by the bins (how glamorous) to discuss strategy, but watching the wedding waiters meant Kendall’s mind was elsewhere. In a heart-rending scene, astonishingly performed by Strong and Culkin in particular, Ken confessed about the Chappaquiddick-esque crash. “I’m a killer,” he sobbed, echoing Logan telling him he wasn’t in last season’s finale. After turning full evil pixie in recent weeks, Roman demonstrated that he had a heart after all. He reassured Kendall it was an accident and he’d heroically tried to save the caterer’s life. “You’re not a killer,” he said, joining crumpled Kendall on the ground. “At worst, you’re an irresponsibler.” Damp-faced and dusty-trousered, Kendall was led away in his brother’s arms. Meanwhile, Shiv got confirmation that GoJo was buying Waystar. Logan was cashing out. Matsson would take control. After three series battling to be Logan’s successor, a “slab of gravlax” was about to steal the throne. In a thrillingly propulsive sequence, the siblings united to torpedo the deal. Even Roman sheepishly admitted they “made a good team” as they drove to confront their father. In the Scooby van, Kendall explained there was a legal way to stop it. Logan needed a super-majority vote from the holding company, in which they had large stakes as part of the divorce settlement from Caroline. He needed their sanction for a change of control. Roman balked at the prospect, until Kendall pointed out that Matsson “will Romanov you”. Shiv told some home truths too: “Dad will never choose you because he thinks there’s something wrong with you.” Recalling how his father had treated him since Chekhov’s dick pic, Roman’s resolve stiffened. And was Kendall up for trying to take down his father again? “Pass me the shotgun. I’ve basically been planning this since I was four.” Shiv proposed pushing out Logan on grounds of ill health, leaving the siblings to run the company together. She phoned husband Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen), told him the plan and asked him to make it a fait accompli by announcing on ATN. “Is he in?” asked Kendall, to which Shiv replied: “Yeah.” But was Tom really? Back at the wedding, sad-eyed Tom was at pains to check where the new-look corporate landscape would leave him. He buttonholed Greg for a heart-to-heart. “Who’s ever looked after you in this fucking family? Wanna come with me, Sporus?” he asked in a callback to episode four’s Emperor Nero weirdness. Greg agreed to “make a deal with the devil”. Was the devil Logan in this scenario? After last week’s backfiring dirty talk and parenting prevarication, was Tomlette finally breaking rank from his power-wife? In a climactic showdown, Logan told his children this was the “optimal moment” to make a deal. He tried to divide and conquer as usual, first telling Kendall to get out, then cosying up with Roman. It was impossible not to feel proud when Romulus stood firm. Logan promised their futures were assured. Nobody trusted him any more. When Roman begged his dad to call off the deal, with the temerity to use words like “please” and “love”, Logan delivered the killer blow. Misogynistically mocking Shiv’s talk of super-majorities, he got their mother on the phone. He’d already redrawn their divorce agreement in exchange for “giving the seat-sniffer a leg up” (presumably wangling Munion a seat in the Lords). The siblings were powerless. Even Gerri (J Smith-Cameron) abandoned poor Roman. Victorious Logan charmingly told his children to “fuck off, you nosy fucking pedestrians”. “Mom, you just slit our throats,” said a shell-shocked Shiv. But worse was to come. As Tom arrived, she saw Logan put an affectionate paw on his shoulder. Shiv realised he’d warned the battle-hardened patriarch they were coming. She became breathless at the betrayal. Just before the credits rolled, her eyes turned shark-like and her face hardened. A dramatically dizzying switcheroo which reset things beautifully for another season of Shakespearean psychodrama. As the series closed, Tom was left in pole position. You can’t say it hasn’t been coming. It had also been him who told Logan where to send the doughnuts of doom. Shiv summed up the situation as only a Roy can: “We just walked in on Mom and Dad fucking us.” The siblings’ game of Monopoly was revealing. Willa didn’t want Tennessee Avenue. Tom got another get-out-of-jail-free card. Shiv was cheating. Connor thought cheating was part of the game. All three series finale titles – Nobody Is Ever Missing, This Is Not for Tears, All the Bells Say – are lines from John Berryman’s poem Dream Song 29. This season three promo poster all becomes clear now. Tom and Greg behind Logan, the siblings on the other side. The clues were hiding in plain sight all along.

12/14/2021,"We begin with a moment of relief. Kendall did not die in the swimming pool (or, as his loving brother Roman puts it, become “Kurt Cobain of the fucking floaties”). Comfry saved him – though for what seems an ever more present question in Kendall’s mind, as he reappears at the villa after a night in hospital for observation still virtually catatonic with guilt and grief. After that, the finale screws begin to tighten and – some of Roman’s best jokes of the season aside – don’t let up for the next coruscating, magnificent hour; probably the best, amid stiff competition, the show has ever done.  The rot – or should we say super-rot, given the family we’re dealing with – sets in when Matsson (Alexander Skarsgård, giving a lovely, light performance as the friendly fellow who will finally blow the Roys to pieces) decides he needs to be in charge of the new company if the merger between his and Waystar is to go through. Logan (Brian Cox, given a small, devastating monologue about the state of the US and modulating seamlessly during it from unassailable force to man who might – just might – be weary of the game) sends Roman back to the wedding villa (“My mom’s getting remarried to a bowl of porridge, it’s all terribly moving”) so he can talk to Matsson alone. At the villa, Greg is still courting his European duchess (“Off a couple of haemophiliacs and you’re king of Luxembourg!” says Tom encouragingly), the siblings stage a semi-intervention with Kendall that actually induces more of an emotional crisis in Connor (“I didn’t see Pop for three years but your spoon wasn’t shiny enough?”) and prompts Willa to comfort him by accepting his proposal. “Fuck it,” she says. “How bad can it be?” Ah, Willa. After the wedding of Mommy dearest, at which Shiv gives – well, let’s call it a stirring speech, news reaches Shiv, Roman and Kendall that Logan is about to sell his empire, their inheritance, to GoJo. They convene in a dusty back lot for an extraordinary scene in which Kendall, sinking to the ground, confesses his role in the death of the waiter at Shiv’s wedding and his brother and sister must find, from somewhere buried by years of dysfunction deep within themselves, a way of comforting him in his despair. In another programme this would have been the apogee of everything. Here it comes but halfway through the finale, and the remaining half hour only builds from there. In a car to Logan’s villa, the children put together their plan to prevent Logan closing the deal and push him out of the company instead – “Full coup,” says Kendall, coming back to life before our eyes – via the supermajority they and their mother, Caroline, have that can block any change in control. Shiv calls Tom to get him onboard, too, and though Roman is unhappy they enter the villa united. And they stay so. But they forgot, alas, that they have not one parent who doesn’t love them, but two. While they were carpooling rebellion, Logan was on the phone to Caroline and persuaded her to change the terms of the divorce agreement that gave them the supermajority. The game has been switched. And it is over. Roman begs Logan not to close the deal – for love of them, he says. “You should have trusted me,” is Logan’s only answer. “Because I fucking win.” Again, a lesser show would have rested happily on its laurels there. But who told Logan the children were coming? Enter Tom, his soft features all concern for his wife and the blow she has been dealt. But Shiv saw her father press his shoulder as Logan left and knows that the Wambsgans worm turned. Because of the love she didn’t have for him. The third season of Succession started well then perhaps wandered a little far into the corporate weeds and let the family stuff, the emotional heft, fall by the wayside. But the second half gathered everything back up and the last four or five episodes were first-class rehearsals for the sheer perfection of the finale; the story tighter than ever, the writing acute and subtle (and never more so than in the callback to Tom’s story of Sporus when, after Shiv’s call from the car, he asks Greg to throw his lot in with him once more), brilliantly funny and wounding by turns. A fourth season is now in the offing. It’s hard to see how they can top this one. But isn’t that what we always say?",Arts/Television & radio,Succession season three finale review – sheer sinister perfection,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/13/succession-season-three-finale-review-sheer-sinister-perfection
12/14/2021,"Conservation documents for more than half of Australia’s critically endangered species and habitats fail to mention climate change according to new analysis that argues there is a significant “climate gap” in the management of Australia’s threatened wildlife. The report was commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) and prepared by the Australian National University’s GreenLaw project, which is led by students in the ANU’s law faculty.  The analysis examined the extent to which conservation documents for Australia’s most imperilled wildlife discussed and addressed the threat of global heating. It found that for 178 out of 334 critically endangered species and habitats the threat of climate change was not mentioned in the government’s conservation information at all. When it was mentioned, the analysis found the information “tended to be brief and generalised” and the recommended actions to mitigate the threat were limited. “Our results demonstrate there is a significant climate gap in the management of Australia’s threatened species,” said GreenLaw chief executive and lead researcher, Annika Reynolds. The report argues that without such an analysis there was a risk that management of wildlife or decisions about developments affecting it would not factor in the impact of the climate crisis. “It means that the recovery actions that are meant to be happening are not going to be informed by the latest and most up-to-date information about the threat of climate change to those critically endangered species and communities,” said Brendan Sydes, the ACF’s biodiversity policy adviser. “Recovery plans are supposed to inform recovery efforts, so if they’re not actually capturing the threats and the actions that are required to address them, there is a risk those actions could be misdirected.” When species and habitats are listed as threatened under Australia’s environmental laws, information is generally prepared that describes the level of decline, key threats and actions to help their recovery. These conservation documents can take the form of either a recovery plan, which the environment minister is legally bound not to act inconsistently with; or, more commonly, a conservation advice – a similar document but which does not have the same legal force under national law. GreenLaw examined these documents for all species and ecological communities listed as critically endangered under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The group found in addition to some documents not mentioning global heating at all, there were others where the threat was mentioned but no actions that could be taken to address it were discussed because this was “outside the scope of the plan”. They found climate was omitted from some documents where there was scientific uncertainty about its likely impact for that particular plant, animal or habitat. But Reynolds said the information gap was also evident for some species that “were known to suffer from extreme heat and drought”, such as the short-nosed sea snake and the leafscaled sea snake. Documents for those species do not discuss climate change directly despite listing coral bleaching as a major threat. There were also other species that fell outside the scope of the analysis because they have a lower threat status but whose documentation excludes up-to-date information on the climate crisis. The conservation advice for the spectacled flying fox lists climate change as a “potential” and “future” threat despite the animal being uplisted to endangered in 2019 after almost a third of its population was wiped out by a heatwave. The report found that conservation documents that had been written or updated in the past three years were more likely to include a detailed analysis of the climate threat. The ACF said the government needed to increase funding for threatened species recovery, including funds to update its scientific information about the impacts of the climate crisis on individual plants, animals and habitats. “There’s just a political commitment that’s lacking at the moment,” Sydes said. Recovery planning for species has come under the spotlight in recent years. Guardian Australia has previously reported that fewer than 40% of listed threatened species have a recovery plan. A further 10% of all those listed have been identified as requiring a recovery plan but those plans haven’t been developed or are unfinished. Even more plans are out of date. In September, the government announced it would scrap recovery plans – in favour of a conservation advice – for almost 200 endangered species and habitats including the Tasmanian devil, the whale shark and the critically endangered Cumberland plain woodland. A spokesperson for the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the minister had reviewed and made several new recovery plans and conservation advices that included new research, bushfire impacts and other factors. “A number of plans are currently with states and territories, and are in the process of being updated to include multiple factors including climate,” they said. “Where relevant, information on climate change informs the development of conservation advice at the time a species is listed and in the development of any recovery plan.” The spokesperson added that the government’s $200m for bushfire recovery had contributed to significant scientific research on species affected by extreme weather. The new threatened species strategy for 2021 to 2026 had eight action areas, including one focused on climate change adaptation and resilience to “reduce the impact of established pressures on threatened species and assist them to adapt to a changing climate”.",News/Environment,Conservation documents for half of Australia’s endangered species don’t mention climate change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/14/conservation-documents-for-half-of-australias-endangered-species-dont-mention-climate-change
12/14/2021,"Glasgow Warriors have asked Exeter Chiefs fans not to wear Native American-style headdresses, or sing their trademark “Tomahawk Chop” chant, during Saturday’s Heineken Champions Cup match at Scotstoun. Exeter are expected to ditch their Native American branding after a majority of their supporters backed changes. Exeter are also thought to be reviewing the use of their nickname, having announced a decision on future plans “within the next few weeks” at the end of November.  The National Congress of American Indians has previously urged the Premiership side to drop their “Chiefs” moniker, while Wasps have asked travelling fans not to wear headdresses to matches between the teams at the Coventry Building Society Arena. The Warriors managing director, Alastair Kellock, has insisted the request is to “stand up” for Glasgow supporters, who had urged the club to take a position on the issue. “Since it was announced in September that we’d play Exeter Chiefs in this season’s Champions Cup, we have taken time to consider our position,” said Kellock. “Following the pool stage draw, we set up a working group to understand and educate ourselves on this sensitive issue and gather the views of our supporters, representatives from the Native American community, the competition organisers, and Exeter Chiefs themselves,” former Scotland international Kellock added. “Today, Glasgow Warriors are asking visiting fans from Exeter Chiefs not to attend the game on Saturday with faux Native American headdresses or chant the ‘Tomahawk Chop’ during the match,” Kellock added. “We are making this request out of respect for the Native American community around the world, whose views on the use of their imagery and cultural heritage we support, and the Glasgow supporters who have called for us to act on this matter.” “Glasgow Warriors is a welcoming club, that celebrates inclusivity and diversity and by making this call for action we want to live up to these values,” the 40-year-old continued. “The club has informed Exeter Chiefs of our request and has the full support of Scottish Rugby.” Several members of the Exeter board are understood to be strongly in support of rebranding. While no formal vote was taken at the club’s annual general meeting in November, it is understood that around 70% of email feedback from fans backed a branding change.",Sport/Sport,Glasgow urge Exeter fans not to wear headdresses at Champions Cup match,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/13/rugby-union-glasgow-warriors-exeter-chiefs-champions-cup
