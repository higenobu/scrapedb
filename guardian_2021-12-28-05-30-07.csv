12/28/2021,"The Los Angeles police department is due on Monday to release video in the case of an officer who shot and killed a 14-year-old girl inside a department store while firing at another person. Last week, LAPD chief Michel Moore, announced that the department would release body camera footage, 911 calls, radio transmissions, CCTV and other case-related evidence.  The 14-year old victim has been identified as Valentina Orellana-Peralta, according to the LA county medical examiner’s office, which ruled the death to be a homicide from a gunshot wound to the chest. Orellana-Peralta died after being hit by a bullet which went through the wall of the dressing room at a Burlington Coat Factory store in North Hollywood on Thursday as police officers responded to a call about an assault, officials said. She was pronounced dead at the scene. The officer involved was put on paid leave, and has not been identified. When officers arrived, they fatally shot Daniel Elena Lopez, 24, who was accused of assault, officials said. Police subsequently discovered a bullet hole in the dressing room wall, which was “directly behind the suspect and out of the officers’ view”, the department said. Details of the alleged assault are unclear, but police said they retrieved a “very heavy lock” which they believe was involved in an assault that left a woman with head and arm injuries. Orellana-Peralta had been shopping with her mother for a dress for a quinceañera – a 15th-birthday celebration – according to the Los Angeles Times. “This chaotic incident resulting in the death of an innocent child is tragic and devastating for everyone involved. I am profoundly sorry for the loss of this young girl’s life and I know there are no words that can relieve the unimaginable pain for the family,” Moore said last week. He went on to add, “My commitment is to conduct a thorough, complete and transparent investigation into the circumstances that led up to this tragedy and provide the family and public with as much information as possible.” Both the California attorney general’s office and the California Department of Justice will be investigating the shooting. The killing has sparked outrage across the US. Domingo García, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, said in a statement: “It is indefensible that trained Los Angeles police officers could open fire in a crowded store at the height of Christmas shopping without first knowing for sure if the suspect was armed.” The case has also drawn comparisons to an LAPD killing in 2018, when an officer fired at a suspect inside a Trader Joe’s store and in the process killed a store manager. LAPD killings have sharply increased this year – the department has fatally shot 18 people in 2021, compared to seven in 2020, according to the LA Times. On Sunday, the department announced that an officer had fatally shot another man who was allegedly holding a knife.",News/US news,LAPD to release video in police killing of 14-old-girl in clothing store,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/27/los-angeles-police-burlington-killing-video
12/28/2021,"My friend and colleague Hilary Perraton, who has died aged 86 of cancer, played a key role in developing distance learning. He was one of the first employees of the National Extension College (NEC), established in 1963 by Michael Young (Lord Young of Dartington) as a pilot for an open university. Later he helped to promote these new methods in less developed countries. Hilary was born in Lee-on-the-Solent in Hampshire to Leslie, a college lecturer, and Marjorie, a teacher. He attended Churcher’s College school in Petersfield and then learned Russian during his national service years. He studied history at St Catherine’s College, Cambridge, where he met fellow student Jean Warner, whom he married in 1960, two years after his graduation.  His first job was for the London county council, “looking after dustbins”, as he put it. From there he went to the Associated Examinations Board as an administrative officer, before joining the newly established NEC. There he helped to pioneer courses combining TV and radio broadcasts, written materials, science kits, postal tutorials and occasional face-to-face sessions. By 1971 he had joined the International Extension College so that he could help to develop these new methods for the benefit of people in developing countries and, on secondment in 1973, he helped to establish the Botswana Extension College. On his return two years later he worked with Young and colleagues to devise a co-operative arrangement with the University of London Institute of Education to provide accredited courses in distance learning. In 1983 Hilary moved to the Commonwealth Secretariat where, drawing on his extensive contacts across the Commonwealth, he was chief architect with Lord (Asa) Briggs in creating the Commonwealth of Learning to promote the use of distance learning methods for socio-economic development. He moved to Barbados in 1994 to develop such programmes for the University of the West Indies and then, on returning to Cambridge in 1996, founded and directed the International Research Foundation on Open Learning. His many publications included Open and Distance Learning in the Developing World (2000). His colleagues found him scrupulously, often stubbornly, honest in his judgments, incredibly supportive, and totally uninterested in status or self-promotion. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth of Learning awarded him an honorary fellowship and, in 2005, he received an honorary doctorate from the Open University. A lifelong reader of the Guardian and a member of the Labour party, he was passionately interested in current affairs, and in retirement from 2002 onwards wrote several books exploring how and why people have travelled abroad to study, including A History of Foreign Students in Britain (2014). He also found time, for some years, to serve as treasurer for an annual Oxfam Walk, and revived his Russian by reading Russian novels with a U3A group. Holidays were always important and he loved to walk in the Lake District and along the South West Coast Footpath, a love he passed on to his children. He is survived by Jean, their children Jonathan and Claire and granddaughter Ruby.",News/Education,Hilary Perraton obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/27/hilary-perraton-obituary
12/28/2021,"My friend Berry Mayall, who has died aged 85 of cancer, was an indefatigable academic, and wanted to go on making a difference for as long as she could. She was not religious, but she came from a Methodist background, and her attitudes were grounded in the idea of service to others and modest consumption. Visiting her in her tiny cottage in Suffolk was like going back to an earlier age, not just minimalist, but without any unnecessary comfort or decoration. She also grew fruit and vegetables in the garden there, and at an allotment in London, where she had a flat in a house shared with her daughter and grandchildren.  Berry was born in Leicester, the youngest of the three children of Dorothy and George Standing; her mother taught tailoring at the WI and her father was a schoolteacher. She graduated in English from Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1958, but came to academia late, after teaching and social work jobs. All her academic life was spent at the Institute of Education (now part of UCL), from the time she joined in 1973 as a researcher at its Thomas Coram Research Unit under Professor Jack Tizard. After her cancer was operated on in 2018 she hoped to go back to her work, but eventually in 2019 she accepted retirement and in 2021 was made professor emeritus. She made an international impact with her work on childhood. Children she thought of as equals, regarding them as being oppressed in everyday life. She was also furious at government policies that made life difficult for children, especially those living in poor circumstances. Her legacy of analytical papers and books explores the constraints of being a child, in different eras, and in different societal settings. Visionary Women and Visible Children: England 1900-1920 (2017) was her last paper. A good mentor, she would carefully read through the work of students and colleagues, expecting everything to be well written. She was also very supportive and a good listener when there were personal difficulties. She was not entirely self-denying. Once a month she and I used to go to Sunday morning Bach concerts at the Royal Academy of Music, and have lunch out afterwards, although she was exceptionally scrupulous in sharing out the costs. We went together on occasional trips abroad, usually centred around attendance at a conference. On these trips she was notoriously irritable and anxious, making her a difficult travelling companion, but she always perked up and enjoyed small and unexpected events, and made insightful observations. In 1964 she married James Mayall. Though they parted company early on, they remained on good terms. She is survived by her daughter, Hannah, and four grandchildren, and by her sister, Gillie.",News/Society,Berry Mayall obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/27/berry-mayall-obituary
