3/6/2022,"France’s interior minister has accused the British government of showing a “lack of humanity” when it comes to helping the Ukrainian refugees who have fled the Russian invasion and are now waiting in Calais for permission to join their families in the UK. Hundreds of Ukrainians have come to the northern French port in the last few days in the hope of crossing the Channel so they can be with relatives who are already established in the UK. According to the French interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, 400 Ukrainian refugees have presented themselves at Calais border crossings in recent days – only for 150 of them to be told to go away and obtain visas at UK consulates in Paris or Brussels. In a letter to the UK home secretary, Priti Patel, Darmanin called on the British government to set up a proper consular service in Calais, adding that its response so far was “completely unsuitable” and showed a “lack of humanity“ towards refugees who were often “in distress”. In the letter, seen by the Agence France-Presse news agency, Darmanin wrote: “It is imperative that your consular representation – exceptionally and for the duration of this crisis – is able to issue visas for family reunification on the spot in Calais.” The minister said it was “incomprehensible” that the UK was able to provide such services on the ground in Poland on the Ukrainian border but could not do so in the its closest neighbour, France. Darmanin told French radio he had contacted Patel twice requesting that the UK set up a consulate in Calais. Although an extended visa scheme to allow more people from Ukraine to join relatives in the UK has been launched by the government, plans for a humanitarian refugee scheme to help those without family ties in Britain have yet to be announced. The Home Office said it had increased its weekly visa processing appointments in the region from 500 to 6,000 a week to speed up applications from individuals hoping to join relatives in Britain, and had increased the amount of time people would be allowed to stay in Britain from one to three years. Officials said it was too soon to say how many people would apply.

Darmanin’s letter to Patel comes months after a new surge in post-Brexit tensions between the two countries in the wake of the drowning in November of 27 people trying to cross the Channel to England in a small boat. The tragedy prompted both sides to exchange accusations of not doing enough to protect refugees and crack down on people traffickers who organise the dangerous crossings in small boats. “Our coasts have been the scene of too many human tragedies,” Darmanin told Patel, alluding to the risk that Ukrainians could seek to cross clandestinely by sea if they did not obtain visas. “Let’s not add to that those Ukrainian families,” he said. The deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, defended 150 Ukrainian refugees reportedly having been disallowed from crossing the channel to the UK at Calais for not having the correct visas. He said the government was not prepared to “just open the door” because that would “undermine the popular support” for helping Ukrainians and therefore hurt “genuine refugees”. “We need to make sure that we’re acting for those who need our support,” Raab told the BBC’s Sunday Morning show. He said up to 200,000 Ukrainians with family links to the UK could apply for a visa and that a new route allowing businesses, charities and individuals to sponsor Ukrainian refugees would be uncapped. Raab, who is also the justice secretary, claimed Britain had shown it would “step up to the plate” to help those in need, citing the Afghan resettlement programme and visas issued to British nationals living in Hong Kong. He added that “most people” in Ukraine would either stay in the country or go to a neighbouring nations in the hope of being able to return home. Immigration lawyers in the UK have written to the government calling on it to accelerate the launch of a humanitarian route for refugees and requesting visa requirements to be lifted for all Ukrainians seeking to come to the UK. The Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association wrote that the current policy was “piecemeal” and was causing “confusion, uncertainty, further distress, and impediments to access to safety in the UK for an already vulnerable group of people”. The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said an emergency Home Office team should be sent to Calais immediately.",News/World news,France accuses UK of ‘lack of humanity’ over Ukrainian refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/france-accuse-uk-lack-humanity-over-ukrainian-refugees-consular-services-calais
3/6/2022,"The UK’s chief of the defence staff has slapped down Liz Truss’s suggestion that Britons could travel to Ukraine to take up arms in the war against Russia, saying doing so would be illegal. Sir Tony Radakin urged people not to rush towards “the sound of gunfire” and stressed there were many other ways that people in the UK could support those resisting the advancement of Vladimir Putin’s troops. The unusually direct comment will be viewed as a strict admonishment of the foreign secretary’s suggestion, which had already been rejected by the defence secretary, Ben Wallace. Last week, Truss was quizzed about the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s call for anyone who wanted to “join the defence of security in Europe” to “stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians against the invaders”. Asked whether Britons should venture out to fight, she said: “I do support that, and of course that is something that people can make their own decisions about. “The people of Ukraine are fighting for freedom and democracy not just for Ukraine, but for the whole of Europe because that’s what President Putin is challenging.” However, Radakin made clear his disdain at the intervention. He told the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme that any Britons who wanted to serve in the military should do so “in their own armed forces”. “We’ve been very clear that it’s unlawful as well as unhelpful for UK military and for the UK population to start going towards Ukraine in that sense,” Radakin said. “Support from from the UK, support in whatever way you can. But this isn’t really something that you want to rush to, in terms of the sound of gunfire. This is about sensible support, based in the UK.” Asked about whether Truss was wrong to have suggested otherwise, Radakin said she was reflecting an understandable desire that Britons wanted to support the people of Ukraine in defending their lands from Russian troops.

However, he said that sentiment should be properly “channelled into support for Ukraine”. “We’re saying, as professional military people, that is not necessarily the sensible thing to be doing,” he added. Wallace has also admonished the suggestion, saying that while defending Ukraine was a “just cause”, British citizens who wanted to fight should “come and join our armed forces”. He previously said: “There are people who will go … I think what I would say is unless you are properly trained, unless you are a, you know, experienced member of an armed forces, I think there are better ways for you to contribute to the security of Ukraine.”",News/UK news,Defence chief contradicts Liz Truss over idea of Britons going to fight in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/06/britons-ukraine-fight-defence-chief-contradicts-liz-truss
3/6/2022,"Bangers that work the prefrontal cortex as much as the pelvis: that’s the manifesto for Belgian electropop duo Charlotte Adigéry & Bolis Pupul. Truth be told, they’re stronger on the hips than the quips. Their debut album, co-written and co-produced with Soulwax, is a treasure chest of funk, French house, sweaty techno and all kinds of dirty electronic weirdness to rival Moloko at their freakiest. But their takes on the fraught subject of wokeness on Esperanto (“Don’t say: I would like a black Americano/ Say: I’ll have an African American, please”), or sexual agency on the Timbaland-flavoured dark R&B of Reappropriate err on the side of basic. The thumping, technoid Blenda, working out the tensions of immigrant heritage, and the rubberised-metal shimmy of It Hit Me, recounting the duo’s moments of sexual awakening, make a better fist of topicality. Their mischievous energy is toughest to resist on the cheeky Ceci N’est Pas Un Cliché, a string of overused lyrical phrases given marching orders over deeply infectious funky house, or Thank You, a pulsing, sarcastic up-yours to all us purveyors of unsolicited advice: “Couldn’t have done this without you and your opinion… Yes, I prefer my first EP too!”",Arts/Music,Charlotte Adigéry & Bolis Pupul: Topical Dancer review – wildly eclectic electropop,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/06/charlotte-adigery-bolis-pupul-topical-dancer-review-wildly-eclectic-electropop
3/6/2022,"On 25 March 1999, everything changed for the small Kosovan village of Krushë e Madhe when Serbian troops moved in and forced the villagers to move out. They were searched for gold and jewellery and herded towards the mosque, where the men were separated from the women. Nearly 250 men and boys were killed or disappeared in what was to become one of the worst massacres of the Kosovo war. Fahrije Hoti’s husband was among 64 whose bodies were never found. Hoti, a handsome and composed woman with neatly cropped grey hair, recalls the terrible days that followed with a chilling clarity, as if every detail of the 15-month war between Kosovo and Serbia-Montenegro were seared into her memory. “They told us they had dug a mass grave and were going to execute us all and throw us into it. Everyone was crying and yelling,” she tells me on Zoom from her home, a short distance from where it all happened. In the confusion, she became separated from her three-year-old daughter and thought her three-month-old son was dead, after he was seized from her arms and hurled on to a concrete floor. But somehow, all three of them survived, along with her father-in-law, who was too old and frail to be taken off with the younger men. Twelve members of her husband’s family died in the massacre, she says, and she was responsible for identifying the remains of her brother-in-law and his 16-year-old son. Now a feature film, Hive, has been made about the period after she returned to her village, and was trying to rebuild her life. The debut feature of Kosovan director Blerta Basholli, Hive was one of the sleeper hits of last year’s Sundance festival, becoming the first film to win all three main awards in the world cinema dramatic competition – the grand jury prize, the audience award, and the directing award. “Fahrije’s story had a great impact on me,” says Basholli. “Being a woman, a mother and having gone through war myself I felt it very strongly and I thought it would speak to other people too, at a time when women all around the world are facing human rights issues in one way or another.” For all the fanfare, and the horrors of its scenario, it’s a work devoid of histrionics, building its power through attention to the make-do of life after the worst has come to pass. A half-submerged lorry lies in the local river, ominous but unexplained, as officials try to identify the dead from fragments assembled in the school sports hall. The story begins with Hoti (a stern-faced Yllka Gashi) sneaking onto a lorry to scrabble through body bags for any trace of her husband, and being repeatedly stung by the bees that provide the family’s only source of income. “Bees cannot handle pain and anger, so I had to give them up,” explains Hoti, with Basholli translating. In desperation, she fell back on the one skill most village women were allowed to display in her deeply conservative community, which was to cook. Before long Hoti was producing jars of ajvar (pepper sauce) in her basement; but when she borrowed an old car and learned to drive, so that she could deliver them for sale in a local supermarket, she crossed a line. The women shunned her, while the men repeatedly tried to sabotage her business. Her own daughter begged her to stop because she was bringing shame on the family. Hoti’s response was to tape up the smashed windows, mop up the mess and carry on; the film shows her slowly but surely winning the women over, while the men continue to hurl insults and stones at her from their stronghold at the local coffee shop. For all its close focus on the face of its lead actor, Gashi, the film is a moving tribute not just to one woman, but to the value of determination and resilience in all women confronted by war and entrenched patriarchal systems. The emergence of the downtrodden widows and daughters of Krushë e Madhe into a shared workspace gives them a chance to exchange their stories, compare their lives, and find a safe space to smile and to dance. Basholli – who, like Hoti, is ethnic Albanian – was a teenager living in the Kosovan capital, Pristina, when the war broke out. Half of her family escaped through Macedonia to Germany, while the other half were forced to tough it out after the borders were closed. She was alerted to Hoti’s story by her boyfriend (now her husband) while she was in New York, studying for a film master’s. Together with Gashi and another actor – both are TV stars in Kosovo – she travelled to the village expecting to have to talk Hoti into letting them make a film of her life, but found it was the older woman who did all the talking. “When I asked if she still waits for her husband, she said: ‘Yes, I still wonder: what if he comes back alive?’ And I was shocked by that answer,” says Blasholli. “It must be horrible to wait for so long and still hope and still not have any answer. That is why I had to work hard with Yllka Gashi to try to understand how it must feel to be Fahrije Hoti. Above all, raising children in these circumstances. I cannot imagine how hard it must be, and she still did it all, stood up and moved on.” Made on location in a neighbouring village, because Krushë e Madhe itself was so destroyed in the war that it had to be entirely rebuilt, the film gives a documentary-style glimpse of a society that feminism forgot, using local people as extras. Hoti’s marriage was arranged by her family, she says, but she was lucky in that her in-laws were relatively open-minded. As newlyweds, she and her mechanical engineer husband travelled to Germany so that he could work as an undocumented labourer on construction sites. She was allowed to do tailoring work at home to contribute to the household income. Some women, she points out, weren’t even permitted to go to the doctor without a chaperone. After the war ended, the family were among the first to return to the village, driven by a determination to find Hoti’s husband and to bring the killers to justice. Hoti and her children set up home with her father-in-law, who is shown, in the film, grumbling about her business and overruling her decision to sell her husband’s bench saw. But for all their disagreements, there is a bond between them based on a shared love of the children and a refusal to accept that her husband – his son – is dead. Hoti went to see the film with a group of local women?. What was it like to watch such painful and personal memories splashed across the screen? “To tell you the truth, I did not expect people to be so interested in my story. I thought they would dismiss it, saying ‘everybody needs to work, everybody needs to break the taboos,’” she says. “But it took me back to that time, and I feel proud that our history is now being seen by the whole world.” Not everyone was so positive, however. Hoti received one text accusing her of embarrassing herself, her family and the whole village by slandering its men. “I’m older now. I have a hard time dealing with these things,” she says. “But if I had listened to what people said, I wouldn’t be where I am today.” She still lives in the village, but recently moved her business from her home to a factory, where she produces ajvar and pickles and is hoping to diversify into jams. As well as employing around 50 local women, she supports others by buying their vegetables and helping to sell their products. Her father-in-law is no longer alive, but her two children work with her. “Above all,” says Basholli, “I hope that, besides connecting with her, people can be encouraged by her to hold on to hope – we all need hope to be able to move on. Fahrije had every reason to give up and she decided not to, and other women joined her to build their own future and the future of their children, therefore changing the mindset of the whole village.” After such vicious hostility, how did she find it in her heart to forgive the men of the village? “I did not forgive them,” she says, “but I worked with them, so that they can have a clear mirror of who I am, what I am doing and why I am doing it. I raised my children; I built a house for them and now my daughter is also married in the same village, so my children haven’t left their roots.” There is still much that needs to change, she says. “Maybe 40% has changed and we need to make it 100%. But the good thing is that the children from the war have grown up. They are travelling more than we did. They’re going to university and they’re seeing things differently. It’s now almost 23 years since the war. Women are more free.” Breaking into the sort of laugh that her screen persona would never have managed, she adds: “We’re even drinking coffee in the coffee shop.” Hive opens in cinemas on 18 March, with nationwide previews on International Women’s Day on 8 March.

3/6/2022,"It would be hard to imagine a more devastating coincidence of art and life than the opening of Postwar Modern in the same week that Ukrainian citizens are murdered by Russian troops. There is no image in the first half of this exceptional exhibition that does not to speak directly from the past into our present. Helmet heads and shattered faces; scarred canvases that resemble wounded bodies; etiolated bronze figures, fragile and on the verge of collapse: British art of the immediate postwar decade fills the lower galleries at the Barbican. Lynn Chadwick’s metal sculpture swoops down from on high, exoskeletal, somewhere between arrow, fish and ruthless missile. Elisabeth Frink’s harbinger birds, headless and sinister, perch along the walls. A suffering Christ, by the British Asian painter FN Souza, is like a Rouault icon all ruined and degraded, with barbed wire for thorns. Two vast canvases in oil and wax encaustic resemble flayed bodies, dripping blood red, nuclear orange and yellow; by the Hungarian artist Magda Cordell, a refugee from Nazi persecution, they appear neither dead nor yet quite alive. The Scottish-Italian artist Eduardo Paolozzi, interned as an enemy alien in 1940, was conscripted to the Pioneer Corps three years later, only to end up camped out for impotent months on a football pitch near Slough. Many of his muckle machine-man hybrids stride through this show. But far stronger, and more surprising, is a small, blackened bronze form that lies beached on its back, like a turtle, yet bristling with lethal nodes – a vulnerable creature doubling as unexploded ordnance. There are revelations all through the show, works of art as well as postwar British artists whose names have been all but forgotten. A gnarled and craggy grey sculpture, which looks as if it has been blasted by a bomb, morphs between the head of a long-haired woman and a Jewish menorah overturned and suspended, horrifyingly, downwards. Intensely affecting, it is by Peter King, a sculptor whose prodigious gifts ceased with his shocking death of sepsis at the age of 29. The excellent team of curators, led by Jane Alison, have also rediscovered Franciszka Themerson, a Polish refugee who made films, published books and designed marionette productions. Her paintings alone have such a poignant tragicomic potency it is astonishing that they are not better known. Some of the canvases carry their burden of paint in slabs, scored and incised like words urgently carved into a wall or a tree. Others are delicate elegies, such as Eleven Persons and One Donkey Moving Forwards, where frightened figures flee headlong through a red-tinged terrain and the donkey is just another number at the back. Made in 1947, it irresistibly calls to the plight of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine today. This is an art that shows what Europe had suffered: the sound of air-raid warnings, the rationing of clothes and food and human happiness, the living with the horrific memories of the past, through the Nuremberg trials and the commemorations of the Holocaust. The show is anything but an encyclopaedic anthology of two decades of British art; its focus is very much the coincidence of art with social history. It is Bert Hardy’s photographs of children playing in the dusty light of Birmingham bomb sites, the contact sheets as damaged as the landscape. It is William Turnbull’s haunting bronze slabs that turned flattened playgrounds and miniature cityscapes into strange board games with rules that could not be deduced. And it is John Latham’s early spray paintings, including an abrupt jet of spreading black paint upon a white canvas – a violent full stop. Of course the establishment names are hardly neglected: Bacon, Freud and Auerbach, Kossoff, Ayres and Clough, whose abstract painting of ice-blue fractal patches twinkling against a kind of chilly whiteness seems to suggest lights on the blink in a concrete jungle. A fearful vision, it is one of many tremendous highlights, judiciously selected as a sign of the times. Freud, in the nightmarish Hotel Bedroom of 1954, is ousted to the window’s edge by the vast bed in which his wife, Caroline Blackwood, lies, eyes heavily swollen. He looks at us, a dark and anxious shadow; she looks away. It is an impasse of guilt and irreversible misery. They had been married for barely a year. There is a dramatic weight to this show: a heavy buildup of emotion, anger and fear, of marked brushstrokes and scored bronzes, of surfaces thick with nameless substances. A famous black-and-white film from 1960 shows Gustav Metzger burning nylon canvases with hydrochloric acid – his so-called auto-destructive art – though he is also represented with a liquid-crystal light show of the sort he used to create for Cream concerts at the Roundhouse, equal parts fetching and monotonous. It was among the world’s very first immersive installations. For there is a secondary narrative at the Barbican, a history of Britain’s avant garde, running through the show like an underground river. There are early pop paintings by Richard Hamilton and David Hockney, one of the Filipino artist David Medalla’s revolving contraptions, mechanically and randomly furrowing sand into circular shapes (auto-constructive art: an antidote to Metzger). A room full of 1960s abstract reliefs by artists such as Victor Pasmore and Mary Martin comes as a happy surprise. These works look at a distance as if they are going to be all clinical, precise and European, but they have a kind of off-kilter Britishness about them. Precise edges have been painted freehand, with all that implies, and reliefs that body forth in glass, wood and duct tape are like hard-edged abstractions coming apart in DIY pieces, slightly haphazard, tongue-in-cheek deconstructions. The complicated network of open-sided galleries at the Barbican has never been so well used. Each space is a self-contained show, involving one or two artists. Freud is paired with Bill Brandt’s tense black-and-white nudes; German refugee Eva Frankfurther’s tender paintings of tired London waitresses with Shirley Baker’s photographs of worn-out mothers minding exuberant children in Manchester. Most startling is the violent art-and-life relationship of the married painters Jean Cooke and John Bratby. Cooke portrays herself with a black eye; or with her brush-hand literally fading out. Bratby would let her paint for only three hours a day. He portrays her with all the brusque and aggressive realism that won him critical praise and the “kitchen sink” soubriquet. She sits cornered behind a table strewn with groceries – vulnerably, brutally naked. This is an enthralling exhibition, bringing Cooke and many other overlooked figures back before the public eye and connecting all of these artists in the context of a cataclysm that overshadowed the country for decades. It is also a magnificent antidote to the cultural triumphalism of the government-sponsored 1951 Festival of Britain. Nobody here is pretending that everything is all right, the future is bright, that humanity isn’t altered or diminished by war. Not many shows can deepen your understanding of a whole era in art, through the lessons of history, and vice versa, but so it is at the Barbican Art Gallery with Postwar Modern.

3/6/2022,"Whether Johnny Marr’s first new music in four years is a double album or four discrete four-track EPs is very much up to the listener, with the first eight tracks here already released last year, and the remainder also coming out on a pair of 12-inches later in 2022. What’s clear, however, is that Marr has shifted slightly from the post-punk stylings that characterised 2018’s excellent Call the Comet. Whereas that felt very much a guitar album, it’s keyboards that take centre stage here on a set of energetic, electro-indie cuts that are as dancefloor-friendly as anything he has been involved with since Electronic. There are echoes of early-00s Primal Scream in places, too, most notably on Tenement Time. While not explicitly about the pandemic, its effects still dictate the mood of Fever Dreams, whether in the sense of foreboding evoked by Receiver’s riff or the reflections on lockdowns’ disorienting telescoping of time on Counter-Clock World, or even just the title. All of which makes the hope provided by redemptive closer Human all the more welcome.

3/6/2022,"Alove story, a ghost story, a thriller: Ayanna Lloyd Banwo’s radiant first novel embraces elements of multiple genres, binding them through incantatory language steeped in the rhythms, fables and spirituality of her Trinidadian homeland. At its centre are two young people wrestling with their destinies. Yejide St Bernard belongs to a long line of women duty-bound to commune with the dead. Her distant mother, Petronella, has railed against this spectral legacy, but now that she is dying it is incumbent upon her to induct Yejide into powers that will shortly become hers, remaking her from the inside out. Meanwhile, Emmanuel Darwin, a country boy, must buy medicine for Janaya, the mother who has raised him single-handedly. The only job he’s able to find is in Port Angeles, a place that “could swallow a man whole”, she warns, believing this is exactly what happened to Darwin’s father. Worse yet, the job is in a vast cemetery called Fidelis, and their Rastafari faith prohibits contact with the deceased. Shaving off his locks in preparation, Darwin becomes unrecognisable even to himself. It’s at Fidelis that Darwin and Yejide meet, first during a wild storm from which she materialises, dressed in white and shaking its locked gates before vanishing into thin air, and later when she arrives to discuss her mother’s funeral. Their connection is instant, electric. But how can they forge a shared future from such radically different pasts? Throughout, the supernatural is rendered in visceral terms. As Yejide comes into her powers, she registers the change first as a pain deep within, “like somebody sink a hook into her belly and yank from behind”. There is nothing fey about her predicament. As Darwin notes when he initially claps eyes on her: “She didn’t look lost or haunted, not at all. She look damn vex.” It’s made all the more plausible by the gravitational pull of Banwo’s lushly delineated world – the cemetery, for instance, with its rampant foliage and gothic funerary architecture, or Morne Marie, the St Bernard family home, built on the ashes of a plantation house, its long corridors and wooden staircases indexing its transformation over the centuries. To his credit, Darwin takes his new girlfriend’s necromancy in his stride. Of more immediate concern is the sinister side hustle that his boss is operating at the bone yard. Errol is his name, though out on the streets he’s known as the Sweeper. He’s a splendid villain, his malevolence balanced by the savvy goodness of Shirley, keeper of all Fidelis’ records. Dickens is one of the less expected literary influences to haunt these magic-realism-inflected pages, but as the book navigates the meaning of family (it doesn’t always have much to do with biology) and inheritance (each generation gets to reshape it), its distinctiveness shines out: this is dramatic, joyful, intensely satisfying fiction. One of Yejide’s fondest childhood memories is sitting on her granny’s lap, looking up at a face “brimming with story”. When she shares with Darwin the tales she heard back then, they “call” to stories he was told and “echo like old truths”. The multiple components of When We Were Birds fit together with that same pleasing resonance. When We Were Birds by Ayanna Lloyd Banwo is published by Hamish Hamilton (£14.99).

3/6/2022,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered the fasting-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war, according to the head of the United Nation’s refugee agency, UNHCR. The warning came as video emerged that appeared to show people trying to escape fighting in Irpin, just outside Kyiv, being shelled by Russian forces amid an evacuation that escorted 3,000 people away from the conflict the day before. Vast numbers of Ukrainian civilians continued to flee cities under bombardment, including the besieged coastal city of Mariupol where Russian forces agreed again to allow an urgent evacuation. With more than 1.5 million refugees from Ukraine reported to have crossed into neighbouring countries in the space of 10 days, the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned after visiting the Moldovan border that the situation would only get worse. “This will be a more complex situation,” he said, after having tweeted on Sunday: “More than 1.5 million refugees from Ukraine have crossed into neighbouring countries in 10 days.” Officials said many of the refugees who had arrived in other countries had friends and places to go to, but Grandi said the growing tide of refugees would put pressure on governments to absorb them. “These governments have done very well in their initial response. They were well prepared. But if the numbers continue to grow it will be a problem.” Grandi’s warning came as shocking images were posted on social media that appeared to show civilians trying to flee Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, coming under Russian shell fire. In the shocking video, a Ukrainian home guard volunteer can be seen being asked about evacuations from Irpin as civilians with suitcases hurry along the far side of the street. He is asked what happened the day before and begins describing efforts to evacuate “casualties … children and women”. As the man speaks, a shell lands near him, knocking him off his feet. With huge queues of cars belonging to those fleeing the fighting jamming roads, and evacuation trains overcrowded with standing room only and not enough space for all those who want to flee, more than 3% of Ukraine’s population have become refugees. In the besieged southern port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, where residents have described desperate conditions under Russian shellfire – including no electricity, food shortages and hospitals operating in basements – a second attempt to organise an evacuation was under way today. On Saturday, the Russian military had refused to allow people to leave the city in their own cars, but on Sunday it appeared to have agreed to let people leave the city in that way, with a ceasefire due to start at midday. Images posted on social media showed a convoy of evacuation buses leaving the city of Zaporizhzhia on Sunday bound for Mariupol. The evacuation attempt on Saturday was halted after Russia shelled the bus depot, with the city’s mayor accusing Russian forces of a deliberate attack. “I’m absolutely sure,” said Vadym Boichenko. “They got information where the [evacuation] buses are and started hitting the bus depot. Yesterday I said we have a humanitarian crisis. Today it’s genocide.” Record numbers of refugees have crossed into Poland from Ukraine with the total number expected to surpass 1 million later on Sunday as Russian forces escalate their invasion. Fresh data shows that Polish border guards cleared as many as 129,000 people at border crossings on Saturday, the most in a single day since the war started, bringing the total to 922,400. “Check-in is as simplified as possible,” the Polish border guard spokesperson, Anna Michalska, said. “The point is to confirm the identity of persons, verify documents, check the databases if they are not wanted persons. It takes a few minutes. “Forecasts indicate that today the number of people who entered Poland from Ukraine from 24 February will exceed 1 million.” At the Medyka crossing, the busiest along Poland’s roughly 310-mile (500km) long border with Ukraine, refugees streamed past boxes of clothes laid out along a path from the border crossing while Scouts handed out hot tea, food and toiletries. Some carried babies, others held dogs and cats wrapped in blankets. Many joined a queue for buses to the nearby town Przemyśl, where friends, relatives and volunteers waited to take them to other cities in Poland and beyond. “In Kyiv there are many bombs and you sit in the basement and still hear it and because of that I left this city,” said Anna Klimova, 21, who was travelling to Wroclaw to stay with her brother. “It’s a really hard situation.” Poland’s Ukrainian community of about 1.5 million is the region’s largest and makes the country a leading destination point for refugees, though fleeing Ukrainians also cross to safety through Slovakia, Hungary and northern Romania.",News/World news,"Ukraine has fastest-growing refugee crisis since second world war, says UN",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/ukraine-fastest-growing-refugee-crisis-since-second-world-war
3/6/2022,"Alexander Lukashenko can boast membership of the tiny club of world tyrants who still call the Russian president Vladimir Putin an ally. But in enabling Putin’s war on Ukraine, the Belarus dictator has in effect ceded control of his country to the Kremlin, the exiled Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya believes. Lukashenko denies that his armed forces are operating in Ukraine or that he plans to enter the war on Russia’s side. But Belarus’s military is now indirectly under Kremlin control, Tshikhanouskaya said in an interview with the Guardian. “It seems to us that Lukashenko is not controlling our military any more, the only thing he is controlling is repression against the Belarusian people,” she said. “We see signs of the military occupation of Belarus.” A US defence briefing last week raised fears that the deployment of Belarusian troops inside Ukraine could be imminent – which would represent a major escalation of the war. Images indicating a build-up of Belarusian forces near the Ukrainian border have also appeared on social media. Tshikhanouskaya said Putin’s aim is “to put blood on the hands of Belarus soldiers, to connect Lukashenko’s regime to this war, to make it an accomplice”. She has started appealing to Belarus troops to either refuse to fight in Ukraine or to desert and switch sides once there, rather than obey “criminal orders”. Belarusian soldiers, many conscripted, are ill-prepared, demoralised and frightened, she said. “We are trying to persuade Belarusian troops not to participate. We are communicating with mothers of soldiers, trying to persuade them not to let their children go to this war.” Belarus became a launchpad for Russian ballistic missile strikes on Ukraine and for invading Russian ground troops on 24 February. Moscow moved an estimated 30,000 of its troops into Belarus in the weeks preceding the assault, officially for “military training”. Four days after the invasion began, Lukashenko revoked his country’s post-cold war constitutional neutrality after a staged referendum gave him clearance to host not just Russian forces permanently but Russian nuclear weapons, removed from the country after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The new Belarus military doctrine appears to remove any remaining facade of independence in Minsk. Moreover, the move to abandon its nuclear-free status and allow Russia to place nuclear weapons on Belarus soil raises an immediate strategic alarm for the west. It also coincided with Putin’s 28 February announcement that he was putting Russia’s nuclear force on alert. “If Putin wants to take control of the entire territory of Belarus tomorrow he could do it,” Tshikhanouskaya said. The Minsk regime’s suppression of any civic or political activity allows Russian troops to use the territory of Belarus as Putin wants, to the point of intervening in its political life “at any moment”, she said. “Lukashenko is a puppet. Putin controls the country through him.” Tsikhanouskaya and her fellow campaigners, many of whom have been jailed or silenced, now have a twin mission: oppose the regime in Minsk and mobilise Belarusians to oppose, and even sabotage, the Ukraine war via a campaign of civil disobedience. “Our fight has doubled – we have two fronts, against the regime and to prove that we are not on the side of war,” she said. Protests, now rare in Belarus, flared in Minsk against the war last week, leading to hundreds of arrests. Tsikhanouskaya wants western governments urgently to see Ukraine and Belarus as strategically linked: thwarting Putin’s assault on Ukraine also requires going after his accomplice in Minsk. In video messages of support for Ukraine she wears a T-shirt bearing the slogan “Glory to Ukraine, long live Belarus”. Ukraine and Belarus are together integral to Putin’s imperial vision, she said, their fates now interdependent. “The Kremlin’s intention is to return our past Soviet Union countries to be one huge empire again.” Forced to seek refuge in Lithuania after standing against Lukashenko in presidential elections in August 2020, which were rigged in his favour, Tsikhanouskaya, a former teacher, now calls herself the legitimate leader of Belarus. European governments have refused to recognise Lukashenko as president since 2020. She previously avoided framing Belarus’s democracy struggle in geopolitical terms; its focus was Minsk not Moscow. Since 24 February that has dramatically changed. “Lukashenko dragged us into this conflict and this war. We have to be on the side of people fighting for their independence.” Lukashenko’s collaboration with the war has complicated life for many who fled Belarus after 2020 and find themselves cast as “enemies” in some parts of eastern Europe. Yet Belarusian volunteers are already fighting in Ukraine to support the resistance, Tsikhanouskaya said. “We are starting the formation of Belarusian forces that will fight together with Ukraine against two dictators: Putin and Lukashenko.” Some analysts believe Lukashenko’s support of the war in Ukraine will expedite his fall. But Tsikhanouskaya is also aware of the immediate peril for Belarusians if Putin prevails in Ukraine and manages to survive an international economic blockade. “We don’t know what kind of deal Lukashenko has with the Kremlin. But it will be a different reality for Belarus. I don’t want to even imagine the outcome if Ukraine falls, it will be a disaster not only for Ukraine and for Belarus but for the democratic world. It will untie the hands of the Kremlin in the future.” But she sees a shift in the popular mood within Russia. “The Kremlin is experiencing huge pressure from inside Russia. People in Russia are not going to be happy about the situation. Russia and the Kremlin are not the same thing.” The EU last week imposed sweeping new sanctions against individuals with links to the Belarus regime, as well as banning most industrial exports, including potash and fertiliser. But Tsikhanouskaya said remaining loopholes must be filled, even if that causes pain for ordinary Belarus citizens. She wants to see Belarus judges who have incarcerated political prisoners for draconian jail terms targeted. “These people do horrible things and have complete impunity inside Belarus.” In December her human rights campaigner husband Syarhei, detained since 2020, was given an 18-year sentence for challenging Lukashenko and inciting the biggest demonstrations in Belarus’s history. News of the Russian attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant evoked disturbing personal memories for Tsikhanouskaya. She grew up in a region of Belarus that suffered radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. “It is horrifying for me personally. When I heard this news I was just praying. We still remember Chernobyl. It can’t be repeated in our region, but it seems [that] in its striving for power the Kremlin doesn’t pay attention to people’s suffering. Look around at what is happening, we don’t know where their red lines are, or even if they have any red lines.”",News/World news,"Belarus has effectively ceded control to Kremlin, says opposition leader",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/belarus-has-effectively-ceded-control-to-kremlin-says-opposition-leader-sviatlana-tsikhanouskaya
3/6/2022,"The first night of James Conway’s English Touring Opera production of The Golden Cockerel was dedicated to the people of Ukraine and to those in Russia protesting against Putin’s war of aggression. Premiered posthumously in 1909 after extensive censorship trouble, Rimsky-Korsakov’s last opera, part satire, part fairytale, is itself a dissident attack on autocracy and imperialism, written in the wake of its composer’s dismissal from the St Petersburg Conservatory for supporting student protests during the Revolution of 1905. The immediate target was military incompetence during the Russo-Japanese war. But Rimsky-Korsakov’s portrait of the paranoid King Dodon, obsessed with largely imagined enemies beyond his country’s borders, maps both on to 20th century history and the current war with disquieting prescience. Conway’s staging, strikingly designed by Neil Irish, takes time to find its feet. We first encounter Grant Doyle’s indolent if dangerous Dodon governing from his bedroom and being literally spoon fed by his former nanny (Amy J Payne), while the Cockerel (Alys Mererid Roberts) surveys the kingdom through a telescope and shouts its intermittent warnings from a watchtower. The humour, however, is often whimsical where it should be barbed, and it is only in the second half, when the mood darkens, that the production really hits home. Russian revolutionary uniforms begin to proliferate amid the fairytale trappings, and the Astrologer (Robert Lewis) and the Queen of Shemakha (Paula Sides) – the only characters who are actually real, we are told – gradually and unsettlingly morph from fantasy figures into Rasputin and the Empress Alexandra. Lewis and Sides also give arguably the finest performances of the evening. Neither role is easy, but Lewis is spectacularly up to the challenges of the Astrologer’s implacably high tessitura, and Sides’s seductive coloratura is both extraordinarily beautiful and exactingly precise. Doyle makes a gritty sounding Dodon, by turns gruff, preposterous and scary, while Roberts voices the Cockerel’s oracular pronouncements with admirable verve and clarity. Gerry Cornelius conducts with fine attention to detail, using a reduced orchestration by Iain Farrington that preserves much of the brilliance and sensuality of Rimsky-Korsakov’s original.
