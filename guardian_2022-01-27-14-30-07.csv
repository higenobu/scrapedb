1/27/2022,"Australia’s Woodside Petroleum has announced it is following multinational energy groups Chevron and Total in exiting Myanmar, saying it is unable to work in the country following the military coup nearly one year ago and the regime’s continuing human rights abuses and violence against civilians. The moves follow pressure from human rights groups, who have called on companies to stop doing business in Myanmar and cut off the flow of money from projects to the junta. February marks a year since the military re-took control of Myanmar in a coup.  Last week Woodside revealed it had terminated a production-sharing contract with the state-owned oil and gas enterprise MOGE in November, and on Thursday the company said it would abandon the remainder of its licences in the country. The contract termination covers an offshore block known as A-7, where Woodside owns 45% and Shell owns 45%, and comes into force on 30 September “with the formal relinquishment process ongoing”, Woodside said. Shell has also given up its licence and “has no licences in Myanmar” after relinquishing them all, a spokesperson said. On Thursday Woodside said it was also withdrawing from two other offshore fields where it holds exploration licenses, AD-1 and AD-8, as well as a second contract with MOGE covering a third block, A-6. The withdrawal will cost a total of US$209m, Woodside told the Australian Stock Exchange. “Given the ongoing situation in Myanmar we can no longer contemplate Woodside’s participation in the development of the A-6 gas resources, nor other future activities in-country,” the company’s chief executive, Meg O’Neill, said. Woodside has not conducted any activities in Myanmar since shortly after the coup and has paid no permit fees to the government in the past year, a spokesperson said. Myanmar’s military seized control of the country in a coup in February 2021 and has since killed more than 1,200 civilians in a crackdown on pro-democracy protests. Known as the Tatmadaw, the military has faced international condemnation over its 2017 “clearance operations” – executed with “genocidal intent”, according to UN investigators – against the ethnic minority Rohingya in Rakhine state, which included mass killings, including of children, gang rapes, arson and torture. More than 25,000 Rohingya were killed, and 700,000 driven over Myanmar’s border into Bangladesh. Yadanar Maung, a spokesperson for Justice for Myanmar, welcomed the withdrawals as “a major step in cutting off funds to the illegal military junta”. “It is essential that the companies exit responsibly, mitigating negative impacts and ensuring the junta does not benefit financially from their withdrawal.” Yadanar Maung said it was “shameful the Australian government had failed to take any meaningful action to stop revenue flows to the junta, not even sanctioning the war criminal and commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing even though nearly a year has passed since the attempted coup”. “Australia is now even lagging behind big oil when it comes to action on Myanmar.” Clancy Moore, the Australian director of anti-corruption coalition Publish What You Pay, welcomed Woodside’s action but said other Australian companies should also pull out and the government should take action against the regime by sanctioning its generals. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Governments including Australia must still introduce sanctions to stop revenue flow from gas, oil and mining funding the military … to wage war against the people of Myanmar.” Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch, said the departure of Woodside following Total and Chevron underscored the need for coordinated and targeted sanctions from the US, EU, Australia, UK, Japan and other concerned governments on Myanmar’s natural gas revenues. “Myanmar’s military will continue to collect massive revenues from natural gas and other extractive sectors unless new targeted sanctions block foreign currency payments, because other companies will take over their operations. Sanctions are urgently needed now on MOGE and other military-controlled entities.” Pearson said the departure of energy companies from Myanmar would be only gestures so long as the junta kept making money. “The US, EU, Australia and others need to impose measures that will have real economic impact on the junta, if there is to be any progress on human rights.”",News/World news,Woodside Petroleum to pull out of Myanmar one year on from military coup,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/woodside-petroleum-to-pull-out-of-myanmar-one-year-on-from-military-coup
1/27/2022,"When Dylan Alcott was announced as Australian of the Year on Tuesday, I was thrilled to see another disabled Australian honoured in this way (he wasn’t the first, his predecessor also had a disability, albeit invisible). I was moved by his speech and I felt hopeful that, as a result, national attention would be drawn towards the important issues affecting people with disabilities – NDIS, discrimination, unemployment, poverty and social isolation to name just a few. Dylan is an amazing athlete, an entrepreneur and a great public speaker. He deserves this – no doubt about it!  Dylan’s story is a delicious blend of inspiration and all the good feels. But forgive me, it’s been hardly 48 hours since he was awarded the accolade and I’m already feeling a bit cringe listening to interviews about how much he loves his disability and I am a little worried about what might become of all this in 12 months time. So I’m getting on the front foot and making a small request to the people of Australia in this year of Dylan Alcott: please don’t judge me and other disabled people for not being as “in love” with our disabilities as Dylan is. In his speech at the awards night and in the interviews I have seen so far, Dylan tells his story of once hating his disability and that over time and with the support of family and friends, he has grown to love his disability. His narrative is one I have heard shared by many disabled people over the years, especially among disability activists as we discovered that our problems lay in the obstacles placed before us by society rather than being inherent to our disability or impairment. It is a very important story that needs to be heard because it challenges the prevailing social narrative that disability is a tragedy and that in turn our lives must be miserable. While I recognise that a lot of the discrimination and injustices I face are societal, I hate the fact that I have a genetic condition that causes severe muscle wasting and that over the years it has slowly crippled me, to where the only movement I have remaining is a wriggle in my thumbs. Does that make me less evolved in my disability journey? Does it mean that I am yet to reach my ultimate destiny of fully embracing and celebrating my disability? Some may presume so. But no, it reflects the severity of my disability and the fact that my disability makes my life really hard. Depending on others for the most basic things. Struggling to eat, drink and breathe is no picnic. Neither is the pain of extreme scoliosis that I experience on a daily basis. I don’t want sympathy. I want people to understand that we can’t all “love our disability”. For me, there’s really not a lot to love. I hate it and always will. Hating my disability doesn’t mean that I hate my life. I love my life and I feel proud of what I have achieved and of the work that I do. I feel proud of and love the disability community that I belong to. So as we spend the next 12 months listening to Dylan and his inspiring, “feel-good” story, don’t forget there are many other stories that might not be quite as heartwarming but that represent the daily reality of disability in its many forms. We can’t all love our disability. We don’t have to. But what we all need to do is work towards a society where accessibility and inclusion are front and centre of social policy so that there is more to love and less to hate about being disabled.
