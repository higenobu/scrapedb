5/9/2022,"At an unpredictable time in women’s tennis, where nearly anyone can beat anyone else on any given day, there is at least one certainty in the Italian Open draw this year. Iga Swiatek, a player who recently won the US Open as a teenager and is now charged with trying to back up that first great triumph, will advance to the second round in Rome. The only question is who she will play against. Either Bianca Andreescu or Emma Raducanu – two players with many similarities – await after they were drawn to face each other for the first time in the first round on Tuesday. While the spotlight has remained on Raducanu in her first full season following her US Open triumph, this has arguably been an even more notable year for Andreescu. Her career so far has been a reflection of the difficulties that tend to come with tasting success at such a young age. First her body could not quite keep up with her talents – she did not compete for 14 months after 2019 because of a torn meniscus and various ailments – then the mental toll of her struggles left a mark. Andreescu said her results came to dictate her mood and self-worth, with consequences that were hard to take, and she eventually decided to step away from the sport indefinitely in October. “I’m being really honest here, but I actually wanted to quit the sport,” Andreescu said in an interview with WTA Insider before she returned in Stuttgart last month. “It was really bad. I am privileged in a way for having this opportunity and doing all of this. Now I’m very grateful, more than ever. So I don’t want people to think: ‘Oh you’re a little baby, just suck it up.’ But it was an accumulation of two-and-a-half years. A lot had happened and I just didn’t want to deal with anything any more.” That desperation gave way to a constructive period of growth. She tried martial arts. She enrolled in dance lessons. She began making music again, an old hobby. She enjoyed the company of family and friends. In short, she lived, something that is not always easy to do during the nomadic grind of the WTA tour. One of her most profound experiences was volunteering for a domestic violence charity, where the discussions she had with survivors informed her own perspective; she resolved to appreciate her life and to use her success to help others. “I’m not identifying myself with the sport any more, because I felt like last year, if I lost, I hated myself,” she said during the Madrid Open last week. “If I won, it was like the best thing ever. “Now I’m viewing tennis as just another opportunity to get better as a person and it’s something I’m passionate about, so I want to enjoy myself out there.” In her short time back on the tour, that new perspective on her sport has yielded positive results. She is still the same relentless streetfighter, roaring between points and getting under opponents’ skin, while picking them apart with brute force and a vast toolbox of shots. Raducanu said: “I think her physicality is one of her strengths, how good she is moving, how low she stays. I think that’s really cool and probably something I can learn from myself.” In Madrid, Andreescu dismantled the Australian Open finalist Danielle Collins 6-1, 6-1 before losing against the eventual finalist, Jessica Pegula. Her level will likely only improve with more time on court. It is a formidable challenge for Raducanu, who is still so inexperienced in big matches against fellow grand slam title winners and has faced her own problems with injury and dealing with high expectations. Regardless of how it ends, it will be valuable for both players.",Sport/Sport,Bianca Andreescu focuses on having fun after enduring two years of hell,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/09/bianca-andreescu-focused-on-having-fun-after-enduring-two-years-of-hell
5/9/2022,"Global markets fell sharply on Monday as fears over rising inflation and a slowdown in China’s export growth fuelled worries about the health of the world economy. Stocks in Asia-Pacific markets, Europe and the US all dropped into the red as investors fretted that global growth is weakening, at a time when central banks are raising interest rates to rein in surging inflation. In London, the FTSE 100 fell to its lowest level in more than seven weeks, down 1.7% or 125 points in afternoon trading at 7,268, with mining companies among the fallers. Japan’s Nikkei had closed down 2.5% earlier on Monday. Stocks slid after China’s export growth hit a near two-year low of 3.9% a year in April, down from 14.7% growth in March. Imports were flat, as China’s Covid outbreaks cut demand and disrupted manufacturing. Analysts said the slowdown showed that the world’s second-largest economy was suffering from the lockdowns in big cities such as Shanghai, which have affected factory production and snarled up logistics chains. “Two of the biggest concerns are supply chains and the impact of inflation including higher interest rates. As a result of severe Covid lockdowns, China’s export growth is at a two-year low,” said Mihir Kapadia, the chief executive of Sun Global Investments. “The supply chain disruptions will in turn impact earnings of companies around the world, and thereby their stocks,” added Kapadia. European markets fell to a two-month low, down 1.7% in afternoon trading. In New York, the S&P 500 index dropped 1.7% at the start of trading on Wall Street, after its worst streak of weekly losses in more than a decade. Commodities weakened, with copper prices hitting their lowest since mid-December in London at $9,160 (£7,440) a tonne. Aluminium, zinc, nickel, lead and tin prices also dropped, on concerns that China’s restrictions are hitting manufacturing output. Emerging market stocks hit their lowest level since June 2020, as China’s slowing economy added to pressures from rising global interest rates, and the ongoing disruption from the Ukraine war. The Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, warned on Saturday that China’s employment situation was “complex and grave”, and called on government departments and regions to prioritise measures to support and retain jobs. That reinforced worries that China’s lockdowns are having a serious economic impact. US government bonds were also hit by fresh selling, which drove up the yield, or interest rate, on the 10-year Treasury note to the highest since November 2018. Yields rise when prices fall. The US dollar reached a fresh 20-year high, lifted by expectations of further sharp increases in US interest rates this year to tackle rising inflation, which is running at 8.5%. “There’s no stopping the mighty US dollar,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos of the brokerage XM. “Stress in equity markets, worries about a synchronised global economic slowdown, and the relentless grind higher in US yields continue to drive up demand for the reserve currency.” Risky assets such as cryptocurrencies were also hit. Bitcoin fell to its lowest level since July 2021, dropping below $32,700, and has lost half its value in the last six months.",News/Business,Global stock markets fall sharply amid fears over inflation and China slowdown,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/09/global-stock-markets-fall-china-inflation-ftse-100-nikkei

5/9/2022,"A French appeal court has upheld the conviction of the former French prime minister François Fillon and his Welsh wife, Penelope, for embezzling public funds in a fake job scandal. However, the judgment, announced on Monday, reduced the sentences imposed on the couple during their trial almost two years ago; Fillon was given a four-year sentence, three of which were suspended, a fine of €375,000 (£320,000) and a 10-year ban from holding a public position. His wife was given a two-year suspended sentence and the same fine. The couple had been allowed to remain free pending the outcome of the appeal. Revelations that the former MP, who was PM from 2007 to 2012 under the centre-right president Nicolas Sarkozy, had paid his wife more than €800,000 over 15 years for doing little or nothing torpedoed Fillon’s hopes of becoming president in 2017. In what became known as the “Penelopegate” affair, a court found in 2020 that Ms Fillon had played a nonexistent role in her husband’s work and both were found guilty of embezzling public funds along with Fillon’s real parliamentary assistant Marc Joulaud. The couple immediately appealed against the judgment and the appeal court heard the case last November. Fillon, 68, a rightwing conservative, was the favourite in the 2017 presidential race before the fake jobs allegations erupted. He refused to bow out of the election after the embezzlement allegations became public, but was eliminated in the first round. Emmanuel Macron won the second round. In a 2007 interview Penelope Fillon, 66, née Clarke, from Llanover near Abergavenny, had claimed she was “not his assistant or anything like that”. In a scathing verdict at the end of the long 2020 trial, the judge declared that Penelope Fillon’s job was either “fictitious or greatly overstated” and said her husband had eroded trust in France’s political class. The court said Ms Fillon, was paid “the maximum possible” and that the sums were “out of proportion to her activities”. “Nothing could have justified the remuneration she received,” said Nathalie Gavarino, the leading judge said in sentencing. Fillon, who has always denied any wrongdoing, has admitted having “made mistakes” but repeatedly said his wife carried out certain assistant duties including opening his mail and proofreading his speeches. The couple, who were not present for Monday’s appeal court judgment, were also said to have organised fake jobs in the upper parliamentary house, the senate, for two of their five children and another fake job for Penelope at a magazine owned by a friend of her husband. In the 2020 judgment, the Fillons and Joulaud were ordered to repay parliament more than €1m in misappropriated public funds. After leaving politics, Fillon joined the board of the Russian state oil company Zarubezhneft in June last year but relinquished his position eight months later after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February. He also gave up his position on the board of Russia’s largest petrochemical producer, Sibur, which he joined last December.",News/World news,French appeal court upholds conviction of François Fillon for embezzlement,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/french-appeal-court-upholds-conviction-of-francois-fillon-for-embezzlement
5/9/2022,"British talents have reaped a phenomenal array of nominations for this year’s Tony awards in New York. Simon Russell Beale, Adrian Lester and Adam Godley, the three lead actors of The Lehman Trilogy, will all compete in the same category and Sam Mendes’s production – seen at the National Theatre in London in 2018 – received five more nods. The musical Six picked up eight nominations, including best musical and best original score for Lucy Moss and Toby Marlow who wrote the show (about Henry VIII’s wives) when they were undergraduates at Cambridge University. Marianne Elliott’s sparkling production of Stephen Sondheim’s Company received nine nominations including one for two-time Tony winner Patti LuPone, who starred in its previous outing in the West End. The show that received the greatest number of nominations, with 11, was A Strange Loop by Michael R Jackson who has already won the Pulitzer prize for this meta-musical about a black queer writer who is writing a musical about a black queer writer. The New York Times critic Maya Phillips said it “pulls off an amazing feat: condensing a complex idea, full of paradoxes and abstractions, into the form of a Broadway musical”. Hot on the heels of A Strange Loop with 10 nominations is MJ, a musical about Michael Jackson, which brought nominations for its star Myles Frost, director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon and book writer Lynn Nottage, who also received a nomination for best play for her drama Clyde’s. Paradise Square, a musical named after a Manhattan saloon in the 19th century, received 10 nominations. for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf received seven nominations as did Girl from the North Country, the musical set to Bob Dylan songs first seen at the Old Vic in London. The nominations for the 75th Tony awards were announced in New York on Monday by actors Adrienne Warren and Joshua Henry. It was a noticeably diverse lineup, confirming the hopes of Audra McDonald – co-host of the 2021 awards – that Broadway is “finally ready to commit to the change that will bring more awareness, action and accountability [and] make our industry more inclusive and equitable for all”. The eligibility deadline for shows to be considered was extended to early May due to a number of productions’ Covid-related cancellations. Heather Hitchens, president and CEO of the American Theatre Wing, and Charlotte St Martin, president of the Broadway League, said: “After the challenges that our community has faced over the past two years, celebrating the artistry of our nominees has never felt more poignant than it does now.” The 2020 edition of the awards was cancelled because of the pandemic, which also led to the delay of the 2021 ceremony, where Moulin Rouge! triumphed, picking up 10 trophies. This year’s awards will be held at Radio City Music Hall in New York on 12 June and hosted by Ariana DeBose, who won an Oscar for her performance in Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story. After Chris Rock was slapped on stage by Will Smith at the Academy Awards earlier this year, the Tony awards announced that it has a “strict no violence policy” and that “in the event of an incident, the perpetrator will be removed”.

5/9/2022,"The protocol was part of the UK’s 2019 Brexit divorce deal with the European Union. To avoid imposing a trade-and-customs border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland it put one in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which in effect remained part of the EU trading bloc. It requires checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Unionists say this undermines Northern Ireland’s position in the UK and could lead to an economic united Ireland. The issue has returned to centre stage because the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) says it will not join a new executive at Stormont unless Boris Johnson’s Tory government alters the protocol. Northern Ireland just had an election for a new Stormont assembly, which is supposed to form an executive – a devolved government with ministers – on Thursday. Power-sharing rules require DUP participation. Refusal to do so will paralyse the executive, creating an impasse that would destabilise Northern Ireland. Downing Street would like to unilaterally change or even dump the protocol – this would please Brexiters and unionists. But it would trigger a trade war with the EU, darken economic gloom and unravel Johnson’s ageing promise to “get Brexit done”. So the prime minister’s team is expected to try to persuade the EU to soften the protocol, with a familiar mix of threat, bluster and warnings. There is no guarantee of a compromise. A trade war could yet happen. The European Commission could widen the list of products that are exempt from checks at Northern Ireland ports and fudge any role the European court of justice has in administering the protocol. Nevertheless, the EU vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, has played down the prospect of big concessions. “The EU has already shown a lot of flexibility by proposing impactful, durable solutions and we stand ready to continue discussions.” The Irish government has backed this position. In limbo. Bar an unlikely breakthrough, the Stormont executive will this week become a zombified administration in which civil servants and ministers from the outgoing executive continue basic functions but cannot take big decisions or launch new initiatives. The executive has limited budgetary powers, which mainly reside at Westminster, but could take steps to alleviate the region’s cost of living and health care crises. If there is no executive after six months, the Northern Ireland secretary of state, Brandon Lewis, must call an election. If the protocol is significantly altered, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson could try to sell that to his party as a victory and lead it into a new executive, even one with a Sinn Féin first minister, restoring a semblance of normality. He could reject any deal as unacceptable. In either case he could also demand a new election to put the deal before voters in hope that the DUP would overtake Sinn Féin as the biggest party, giving it the right to nominate a first minister. Most people in Northern Ireland support the protocol while most unionists oppose it, with the most radical critics yanking Donaldson to a hardline position. Having just overtaken the DUP – the first time a nationalist party has won most votes in Northern Ireland – Sinn Féin can nominate deputy leader Michelle O’Neill as first minister. Previously she was deputy first minister, a post with equal power but less prestige. Sinn Féin has previously collapsed Stormont over rows with the DUP but this time around is vowing to make it work, which would burnish its image in the Republic of Ireland, where it hopes to win power in the next election. Alliance, a centrist, unaligned party, and other moderates such as the Ulster Unionists and the Social Democratic and Labour party want an executive formed as soon as possible regardless of what happens to the protocol. The Alliance has argued for a change in the rules so that no one party can block the formation of an administration.",News/UK news,What is the Northern Ireland protocol and why is it back in the news?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/09/what-is-the-northern-ireland-protocol-explained-brexit
5/9/2022,"Bimini, 28, shot to fame as the runner-up in series two of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK, which aired in 2021. The performer, originally from Norwich, has since released a book – Release the Beast: A Drag Queen’s Guide to Life – and a single (God Save This Queen), and has toured the UK with the cast of the series. You came to acclaim during lockdown on Drag Race UK – what were the highlights of your experience?Our series came at a time when people really needed it because of the pandemic. We were in a dark place, and I think the highlight was being able to lift people’s spirits, and give them a bit of hope and a bit of the laughter that we all needed. When the show went out, all the pubs and clubs were still shut, and we were worried because we weren’t making any money performing. But it also benefited us in a weird way; we were able to show the vulnerable side of what we all went through in lockdown on the show. Which TV gig were you most jealous of in 2021?It’s not from 2021, but I wish I could’ve played Tanya Turner in Footballers’ Wives, I love how camp and ridiculous it is. If anyone from ITV is reading this and wants me for a reboot … The TV show you can’t wait to come back?The spin-off of Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon. I’m excited to watch that because I loved the Targaryens. I know a lot of people felt let down by the last series, but let’s see. Have you ever been mistaken for anybody else?Katie Price [whom Bimini portrayed for the Drag Race Snatch Game episode]. Nightmare! What makes you happy?Seeing people thriving, especially queer people. We’re in a time now when a lot more opportunities are given to LGBT+ people, and I hope that continues. Your favourite TV show growing up?Buffy the Vampire Slayer. That was my awakening as someone who felt different and excluded. Buffy gave me a bit of hope, even though it was about vampires and demons. It’s aged well. What do you eat in front of the TV?I drink decaffeinated Earl Grey with some ginger nuts or rich tea biscuits. I could eat the whole packet in one go. What makes you reach for the remote (to turn the TV off)?Sports. I’ve got repressed feelings about sport from high school and being queer. What would you be doing if you weren’t doing your job?I would probably still be a yoga teacher. That was the only time I had routine in my life, and my body always felt really good. But I love the juxtaposition with where I’m at now. It’s the complete opposite of what I was doing then.  Series one to three of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK are available on BBC iPlayer.

5/9/2022,"The gateway to the majestic region of east Crete, Agios Nikolaos has long been a magnet for health seekers coming to indulge in healing spa treatments, soak up vitamin D on the island’s glorious beaches, enjoy the famed Cretan diet and escape the coastal crowds by hiking high into mountains along pine-fringed winding shepherd’s tracks that lead to dizzy gorges, mythical caves and ancient Minoan sites. Set on a hill overlooking the sparkling waters of Mirabello Bay, this idyllic seaside resort, with its small sandy beach and tangle of shopping lanes has been a centre of wellness since antiquity when, according to mythology, the goddess of wisdom and war, Athena, and her sister Artemis (who was in charge of nature and fertility) bathed in Voulismeni, once a freshwater lake – it is now connected to the sea – surrounded by cinnamon-coloured cliffs, which sits at the centre of town. Boats on Lake Voulismeni (top); the port of Agios Nikolaos; the waters of Mirabello Bay Soak up those healing vibes yourself by joining locals in their laid-back way of life: enjoy a lunch of grilled fresh fish or sip thimbles of treacly café elliniko at one of the tavernas clustered around the lake’s edge, or stroll past bobbing fishing boats to light a candle in Voulismeni’s tiny fisherman’s church, which now doubles as a quirky nautical museum. The classical physician Hippocrates recommended thalassotherapy – ocean bathing and the use of marine products – to stimulate and regenerate body and soul. Surrounded by Blue Flag beaches lapped by mirror-clear waters, the Agios Nikolaos area is the perfect place to wallow in those healing waters while catching some of the sun’s therapeutic rays. Panagia Kera in Kritsa (top); Voulismeni’s fisherman’s church; Agia Triada There’s also spiritual solace to be found in one of the region’s beautiful monasteries: soothe your soul in the incense-bathed tranquility of Agia Triada or make a beeline for Kritsa, where icons in the mountain village’s Byzantine Panagia Kera church are said to work miracles. Food is also a major reason to visit east Crete, where the lauded Mediterranean diet is central to daily life. Dishes cooked with fruity, local extra virgin olive oil are based on whatever grows in the garden or can be found close to hand: such as the famed briam, a delicious bake of layered seasonal vegetables piled on with a rich tomato sauce. Olive groves supply local olive oil makers; a traditional briam; the Lasithi plateau Head for traditional villages – such as Mochlos along the coast, or Tzermiado on the windmill-spiked Lasithi plateau – to indulge slow-roasted lamb kleftiko, snails xochloi in a garlicky sauce, and horta vrasta, lightly steamed wild greens drizzled with the award-winning local olive oil. Produced here since Minoan times, wine is currently experiencing a renaissance in east Crete, as the island’s pioneering growers, oenologists and winemakers work to rescue forgotten grape varieties. Sipping those antioxidant-packed tipples on a tour of the local vineyards is the perfect way to end your wellbeing break on this Greek island where Athena once came to get away from it all. Where to stayWith wellbeing and sustainability at the heart of its ethos, Daios Cove Luxury Resort and Villas – a sumptuous stone-built hideaway overlooking a secluded silk sand beach near Agios Nikolaos – makes the perfect base for a healthy stay on Crete’s secluded north-eastern coast.

5/9/2022,"Russian forces are continuing their offensives in southern Ukraine and Donbas in the east, where fighting is taking place in villages across the region. Ukrainian officials said the Black Sea port of Odesa was hit by four cruise missiles fired from Crimea on Monday. More than 60 people were feared dead after a Russian bomb flattened a Ukrainian school being used as a shelter in Bilohorivka, an eastern village, Ukrainian officials said. Heavy fighting is still raging at the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, as Russian forces attempt to finish off the city’s last-ditch defenders and complete the capture of the strategically vital port. Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are holed up in the steel mill’s underground bunkers, many of them wounded. The remaining civilians were evacuated on Saturday. Video published by a Russia-backed separatist group on 4 May appears to show an attack on the plant. It is unclear when it was filmed: Footage published on 3 May showed smoke raising from the steelworks: Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long considered the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and Belarus before the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had 169,000-190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land, and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine would never join Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
5/9/2022,"A 14-year-old boy smirked and laughed after thrusting a knife into the neck of the 12-year-old Liverpool schoolgirl Ava White, a court has heard. The boy, who cannot be named, has gone on trial accused of murdering Ava when she went with friends to watch the switching on of the Christmas lights in Liverpool city centre on 25 November last year. Ava and the boy got into a row after she took exception to him filming her messing around – footage that was intended for Snapchat. The boy admits a charge of having an offensive weapon but denies murder. The prosecution said the boy would claim he stabbed Ava in self-defence. Charlotte Newell QC, prosecuting, told the jury on Monday that Ava was part a group of 10 children aged between 11 and 15 who gathered to hang out in an area behind the Royal Court theatre. Four small bottles of vodka were being drunk, mixed with soft drinks. The group were “messing around, sitting in plant pots, sitting on top of each other, sitting on the floor, cuddling each other, dancing, singing, pulling up plants and throwing them at each other, and plainly in high spirits,” Newell said. They were moved on by a security guard and ended up in another street, School Lane, where they continued to lark around, the court heard. It was here that a group of four boys aged 13-15 started filming “Ava’s antics”, said Newell. “In due course that footage was to be distributed via the social media platform Snapchat. Footage of Ava messing around on the street.” Ava approached the boy and asked him to stop and to delete the footage. The court heard that the boy reacted by stabbing her in the neck with his flick knife, causing catastrophic bleeding that was to prove fatal. Newell said the boy would claim it was self-defence. “Doubtless she was angry with him and doubtless he didn’t like that,” she said. There was pushing and shoving. “But his reaction to 12-year-old Ava confronting him in that way was not to … slap her or punch her or try to grab her arms or to ask anybody in the surrounding group for assistance”. Instead, Newell said, the reaction “to 12-year-old Ava was to reach for his knife” and rather than waving it around to warn her off, or shouting “I’ve got a knife”, it was to “thrust that knife into the neck of this unarmed child”. It was with the equivalent force of a “firm punch”, Newell said. The incident was over in 20 seconds and all four boys ran away, with the defendant discarding the knife in undergrowth and his coat in a wheelie bin, the court heard. He would first tell police that he had not been in the city centre that night, said Newell. Then he said another person committed the act. Neither of which was true, said Newell. “His reaction at the time was to smirk, to laugh and to run away, leaving Ava to die whilst he sought to distance himself from his actions.” Members of the public and staff at Liverpool One shopping centre were drawn to Ava’s screaming, and attempts were made to stem the bleeding. She was taken to Alder Hey hospital where “she gained consciousness but became very distressed”, said Newell. “She was taken to a hospital bed and as that happened she went into cardiac arrest. Every effort was made to save her life.” The judge Mrs Justice Yip told the jury that the defendant has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and they may see him using a fidget toy to help his concentration. The boy also denies an alternative charge of manslaughter. The trial, expected to last three weeks, continues.",News/UK news,"Boy laughed after stabbing Liverpool schoolgirl Ava White, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/09/boy-laughed-after-stabbing-liverpool-schoolgirl-ava-white-court-told
5/9/2022,"We all watched the Eurovision Song Contest and it was our manager, Tony Hiller, who suggested we should enter it. Of all our songs, Save Your Kisses for Me stood out. At first it went: “Oceans of love, oceans, oceans of love” but “Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me” was a stronger hook. We knew the judges would vote after just one or two listens, so we needed something catchy at the end. We tried writing about animals because people all over the world love them, then tried something about children. We came up with: “Won’t you save them for me / even though you’re only three?” and thought: “Bingo!” That last line gave the song a twist. Until then you’d think it was a love song from someone going to work who wants his wife to save her kisses until he gets home, but that line reveals that he’s singing to his daughter. We wrote and recorded it in Denmark Street with two guys from our live band and some session musicians, putting on glockenspiels and such. We got through A Song for Europe, the televised process where they choose the UK entry. Then for the 1976 Eurovision final, our choreography and dance routine was conceived by Guy Lutman, who was usually the resident singer on the Lift Off With Ayshea kids TV show alongside Ollie Beak the puppet owl. He came in to where we were recording and showed us these odd moves, like the raised knee. We went: “Are you joking? We’re singers, not dancers.” But he convinced us to practise the dance routine so much we could do it in our sleep. In the final, in Holland, there were 18 countries, not 40 as there are now. We were on first and people were going: “You’re the winners.” We said: “Don’t be silly,” but then suddenly we’d won it. You never realise what’s coming, certainly not that the song would sell six million copies and change our lives forever. A few days later we went shopping in Leeds and people were following us around. It’s funny. Because we’d had hits in Europe before Eurovision, Abba had sent us Mamma Mia to record. We knew it was a potential smash, but left it for the next recording session because we wanted to do Save Your Kisses for Me. Of course, Abba then did it themselves. Who knows what might have happened … but Save Your Kisses for Me worked out well enough for us. It was No 1 in 33 countries and is still the biggest-selling Eurovision winner of all time. I was standing in for the Joe Loss Orchestra after the regular singer had lost her voice. We performed on one side of a revolving bandstand, and on the other side Martin was singing in a group called the Migil Five. I’d sit on the balcony of the Empire in Leicester Square with a cup of tea and watch him, thinking: “He’s a good singer.” I never dreamed we’d end up in a band or get married, but when Brotherhood of Man needed another girl vocalist [alongside Nicky Stevens] he remembered me. I thought I sang really badly at the studio audition but when I heard my vocals coming back through big speakers with the music it sounded really good. In the final of A Song for Europe we beat Co-Co, which Cheryl Baker [subsequently in Bucks Fizz] was in, by just two points. I knew the commentator, Ray Moore, so when he announced that we’d won he said: “This gives me the greatest pleasure …” We were on our way. By the time we got to the Eurovision final, Martin and I were a couple. He was so nervous he sat up all the previous night. But we were already No 1 in the British charts and I remember saying: “Come on, let’s do this for our country.” During the rehearsal Martin couldn’t hear the count-in, so he came in at the wrong time. We’d been told that the judges would attend one of our rehearsals and Martin went: “I hope to God it wasn’t that one.” Luckily the conductor, Alyn Ainsworth, made the count-in volume louder on the night. By then we’d rehearsed so much that I couldn’t sing the song without doing the dance. There were a lot of good entries and we were worried about the French song, but it was wonderful to win. I still remember getting back to our little bungalow in Wakefield. The whole street came out to welcome us.  The Eurovision Song Contest final is on 14 May.

5/9/2022,"There is still a long way to go before South Africa and other developing countries can manufacture Covid vaccines and treatments quickly and without paying the huge charges demanded by the big US and European drug companies. Last week, the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that the 180-member trade forum had taken a step towards a patent waiver that would allow developing countries to make the drugs they need – including vaccines, tests, and treatments – for as long as five years, without payments to pharma giants such as Pfizer. The EU, India, South Africa and the US, known as the Quad, claimed to have come to an agreement on the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (Trips) waiver proposal, with China also expected to vote in favour. Except the deal only provided for a continuation of Quad negotiations, and on the table at the moment is no more than what was on the table last year. Max Lawson, co-chair of pressure group People’s Vaccine Alliance, said: “It is a tragedy that it has taken almost two years and millions of deaths to reach this point, and a travesty that the action proposed falls well short of what is needed.” Health and anti-poverty campaigners say WTO boss Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, elected last year amid a fanfare of hope and expectation, appears to have provided cover for big pharma rather than pushing for wider access, as she promised. Ngozi’s supporters say she is playing a long game, though Covid-19 may be a distant memory – and Pfizer shareholders even richer than they are today – by the time this long game plays out. She is understood to be in favour of a full waiver, but progress towards a breakthrough remains elusive, despite official claims to the contrary. Lawson said the WTO continues to place corporate interests over the needs of global health. “It adds more unnecessary barriers than existed before negotiations began, and failure to act now on treatments and tests is inexcusable.” EU nations, distracted as they are by the war in Ukraine, want their own big pharma to rival firms in the US. Which is why, Lawson added, “this is not the Trips waiver supported by over 100 governments. It is not endorsed by any member other than the EU. And it is utterly insufficient for a pandemic that has killed an estimated 20 million people and rising”. Other experts have been demanding comprehensive change for months. In a letter to South African president Cyril Ramaphosa in March, Peter Kamalingin, Oxfam’s pan-Africa director, Jayati Ghosh, professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, and Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, accused the WTO of failing to deliver “any meaningful access to vaccines, treatments, or tests”. They said the EU had launched a “belligerent blockade of any actual waiver of intellectual property (IP) barriers” and criticised the US for its “insistence that the IP waiver it supports be limited to vaccines”. The EU and US have also required countries to seek authorisation on a product-by-product basis, “meaning no simplified pathway for follow-on manufacturers to produce and enter the market”, they wrote. The three experts, who support South Africa’s campaign for a full-waiver of all IP and patents on Covid medicines, said the WTO proposals needed to cover lifesaving treatments and diagnostics for Covid-19 because they are a vital part of an arsenal to prevent, treat and contain the virus. The problems faced by Ramaphosa in seeking to move the sluggish decision-making apparatus at the WTO are compounded by the complexity of vaccine manufacture, which relies on more than just access to patent information. He knows that taking off the table the secrets behind treatments for Covid-19 severely limits the ability of poorer countries’ health systems from tackling further outbreaks of the disease. The People’s Vaccine Alliance adds that another demand of the EU, that countries wanting to manufacture Covid-19 vaccines must “notify the WTO’s Trips council before exercising any of these rights”, was “akin to putting a target on your back for pressure from nations housing big pharmaceutical companies”. Why would the EU and US play hardball? Moderna and Pfizer, which uses the German firm Biontech’s IP, will have new vaccines on the market by the autumn – known as “bivalent” vaccines, that address Omicron as well as the other previous incarnations of Covid-19. German firm CureVac has partnered with Britain’s GSK to make their own version. Lots of other pharma companies are in the hunt. This means that once again there will soon be new, better drugs for the rich countries, with developing nations at the back of the queue – and still paying top dollar for earlier vaccines less tailored to viral variants and mutations.",News/Global development,Affordable Covid drugs kept out of reach by sluggish WTO,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/09/affordable-covid-drugs-wto-pharma-giants-intellectual-property
5/9/2022,"Keir Starmer is set to announce he will resign if he is found to have breached Covid-19 rules at a gathering of campaign staff for a curry in Durham. The Labour leader is expected to make a statement at 4pm after pulling out of a keynote speech on Monday morning amid wrangling over the wording of the commitment. Labour MPs expressed fury at the chaos – with briefing lines produced by Labour HQ as late as Monday morning saying that Starmer was emphatically not considering the possibility that he would pledge to resign. One senior source said there were several people within Starmer’s team had argued hard that he should stake his leadership on having done nothing wrong – a move that would put pressure on Boris Johnson. Starmer pulled out of a speech at the Institute for Government, as he wrestled with how to respond to renewed pressure on him over the conduct of aides at the gathering in Durham, with some reported to have been drunk. Durham police have launched a new investigation into the event and Labour has insisted the takeaway was ordered only to feed campaign staff working into the night on the Hartlepool byelection. A leaked memo obtained by the Mail on Sunday has added fuel to the story, showing the decision to order a takeaway was pre-planned, which appeared to counter earlier claims it was decided on the night as “nowhere served food”. Labour has said the memo shows the food was part of the working day and not a separate social event. The growing pressure from the scandal has caused some despair among Labour MPs for preventing the party from capitalising on local election results and key airtime ahead of the Queen’s speech on Tuesday. “We’ve lost hugely valuable time to make our case for what we would be doing in government by cancelling this speech – all because Keir is yet again unable to be bold,” said one MP, who has counselled in favour of Starmer saying he would be prepared to resign. A series of formal requests for comment to Starmer’s office and Labour brought no response. Asked why Starmer had pulled out of an Institute for Government event on Monday, at which he would have faced media questions, the only comment was that “plans change”. Wes Streeting, the shadow education secretary, earlier said he did not know why the decision had been made to pull out of the event. “No idea,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “And I didn’t ask before I came on because I just thought it was such a trivial issue. I do think the idea that Keir has been somehow ducking scrutiny on this is ludicrous, given he has been in front of the cameras repeatedly over the weekend.” Streeting said the memo was a “standard visit plan” for such campaigns. “I don’t think anything that I saw in the memo in the Mail contradicted anything that Keir Starmer has said,” Streeting said. Mary Foy, the Labour MP for City of Durham, in whose constituency office the meal was eaten, denied reports on Monday that some staff had been drunk. “These allegations about my staff are untrue,” she said in a statement. “I have already said that I and my team were working during a very busy period, including facilitating the leader’s visit. I do not believe either I or my office staff broke any rules.” The universities minister, Michelle Donelan, told Sky News the fact Starmer was being investigated “smacks of sheer hypocrisy given the relentless focus he has placed on Partygate”. Asked if he should resign if fined, she said: “He’s going to have to search his soul after making this a top priority over the last few months at the expense of key issues like the rising cost of living.” ",News/Politics,Keir Starmer considering promising to resign if found to have breached rules,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/keir-starmer-covid-rules-durham-lockdown-labour
