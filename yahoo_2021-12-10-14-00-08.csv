Driving the news: Bayne Bunce, 59, who answered a call to assist federal air marshals aboard Delta flight 342 said he saw a man trying to ""get at"" a flight attendant. Oklahoma City Police Capt. Arthur Gregory told Axios in a phone call that an air marshal attempted to take the suspect into custody after he ""assaulted a flight attendant,"" but he ""proceeded to assault the air marshal."" The suspect was eventually placed in handcuffs and the pilot diverted the plane to Will Rogers World Airport, where the suspect was escorted off the flight, authorities said. The FAA confirmed the diversion to Axios in an email and said it ""investigates every unruly passenger report it receives from the airlines."" Gregory said the FBI could also investigate. The big picture: The FAA and the Justice Department established an information-sharing protocol in August to refer unruly passenger cases to the FBI for review. The FAA launched a ""zero tolerance"" policy on unruly passengers in January and has since increased fines — with a recent case facing a $40,000 penalty. The agency has referred the ""most egregious"" cases to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution. Delta Airlines did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment.

12/10/2021,"By Tim Reid LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A judge in Texas ruled on Thursday that a law prohibiting abortions after about six weeks violated the state's constitution because it allows private citizens to sue abortion providers. State District Court Judge David Peeples was ruling on a contentious Texas law that bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat has been detected, usually after about six weeks and when many women do not yet realize they are pregnant. Abortion providers signaled that despite the ruling, they are unlikely to resume the procedure until an expected ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. The law, which went into effect in September, effectively bans nearly all abortions in Texas, America's second most-populous state. Texas Right to Life, an anti-abortion group that backed the law, immediately filed an appeal against Thursday's ruling. The law was designed to avoid normal means of legal challenge, because rather than making state officials responsible for enforcement, it instead gave private individuals anywhere the right to sue doctors and others who provide abortions after six weeks in Texas. Peeples ruled that the law unconstitutionally gave legal standing to people not injured, and was an ""unlawful delegation of enforcement power to a private person."" The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments about the Texas law last month and is expected to issue a ruling in coming weeks. The nation's highest court this month also heard arguments about a restrictive Republican-backed Mississippi law that is seen as a direct challenge to the court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide. In oral arguments on Dec. 1, conservative justices, who have a 6-3 majority on the court, signaled a willingness to dramatically curtail abortion rights in the United States. A ruling on the Mississippi law is expected by the summer.

12/10/2021,"Rep. Matt Gaetz and Steve Bannon floated ideas for what it would be like if Trump runs and wins in 2024. Gaetz said that an ""army of patriots"" should get ready now to ""fight"" for the country. Bannon said ""shock troops"" divided into teams could take over some 4,000 government positions. Florida lawmaker Matt Gaetz and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon floated an idea that an ""army of patriots"" and ""shock troops"" should be prepared to take over the government if the former president runs and wins in 2024. During Thursday's episode of Bannon's ""War Room"" podcast, he and Gaetz outlined their plan if Trump should win. Trump has not yet publicly announced that he is running in 2024. ""People didn't like that Donald Trump raised his voice, but sometimes you gotta raise your voice to raise a ruckus and to raise an army of patriots who love this country and will fight for her,"" Gaetz said. ""We're going to operationalize the performance to go right after the people who are imposing the vaccine mandates, who are enriching themselves and who are selling out the country,"" Gaetz added. Bannon then went on to suggest to a nodding Gaetz that there should be a ""theory of governing"" before elaborating on what his plan would be if Trump were to be president again. ""It's fresh and it's new. This is Trumpism in power. That's when we went to the 4,000 shock troops we have to have that's going to man the government. Get them ready now. Right?"" Bannon said. ""We're going to hit the beach with the landing teams and the beachhead teams and all that nomenclature they use when President Trump wins in 2024 — or before."" Bannon went on to suggest that these 4,000 shock troops would then become ""political appointees."" ""On Capitol Hill, you're going to have Gaetz, and others,"" Bannon said. ""No more powderpuff derby. This is going to be hardcore accountability at every committee."" ""And we're going to go after this administrative state and we're going to start at the Department of Justice and the FBI. That's the job I want. You know, send me over to the Judiciary Committee and their sphincters will tighten because they have been doing a lot of corrupt things over there,"" Gaetz said in response to Bannon's suggestion. It is unclear what Gaetz and Bannon meant, specifically, when they referenced an ""army of patriots"" and ""shock troops."" Representatives for Gaetz and Bannon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider. In October, Bannon made a similar, albeit less detailed suggestion when calling into NBC News. ""If you're going to take over the administrative state and deconstruct it, then you have to have shock troops prepared to take it over immediately,"" Bannon told NBC. ""I gave 'em fire and brimstone."" In November, Bannon appeared in court to face criminal contempt charges for defying a subpoena to sit for a deposition and produce documents related to the January 6 Capitol riot. The former White House chief strategist faces two criminal contempt of Congress charges, and his trial date is set for July 18, 2022.
