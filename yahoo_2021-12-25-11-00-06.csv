12/25/2021,"An 81-year-old Capitol rioter was sentenced to 3 years of probation and 90 days of home confinement. Gary Wickersham expressed remorse at the Tuesday hearing, where a judge commended him for his regret. Wickersham initially told investigators he thought the riot was staged to make Trump supporters look bad. One of the oldest known defendants charged in the January 6 Capitol riot was sentenced to three years of probation this week, months after an acquaintance reported him to the FBI for his participation in the insurrection. Gary Wickersham, an 81-year-old Pennsylvania Army veteran, was also ordered to pay a $2,000 fine and $500 in restitution for his role in the attack. Judge Royce Lamberth, 78, at the Tuesday hearing, commented on Wickersham's age, saying he is ""the first defendant I've had that's older than me in quite some time,"" according to CNN. During the hearing, Wickersham acknowledged and apologized for his participation in the siege. ""It's not like me to do that,"" Wickersham said, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. ""In my whole 81 years, that 22 minutes I spent in there, it was a dark blot … I regret doing it. I shouldn't have been in there."" Lamberth commended Wickersham for his contrition, telling the defendant he would ""get some credit"" for admitting his faults. But on top of the probationary punishment, the judge also sentenced Wickersham to 90 days of home confinement. An attorney for Wickersham had previously argued against any home detention, telling the judge doing so would inhibit Wickersham from being able to visit his grandkids during his ""golden years,"" CNN reported. Prosecutors were first alerted to Wickersham's presence at the Capitol on January 6 when an anonymous source brought forth a text message Wickersham had sent to a different acquaintance claiming to be inside the Capitol, according to charging documents. Investigators eventually located photographic and video evidence of Wickersham inside the building wearing a leather jacket and backward baseball cap, a criminal complaint said. When investigators first interviewed Wickersham about his participation in the attack, the Army veteran appeared to show little remorse, telling FBI agents he believed the riot was full of ""antifa"" protesters aiming to make Trump supporters look bad. Wickersham also alleged that Capitol Police officers were purposefully unprepared to allow the rioters to easily storm the Capitol and be arrested, according to charging documents. Wickersham told investigators he stayed inside the Capitol for about 22 minutes and initially argued that he was able to do so because he paid US taxes, according to prosecutors. During Tuesday's hearing, Wickersham's attorney said his client's comments were poor phrasing, The Inquirer reported. ""I regret doing it, I shouldn't be in there. I think the remarks I made that it was public property, I don't remember if I said that or not, I still shouldn't have been in there,"" Wickersham reportedly said during the hearing. Michael Noone, an attorney for Wickersham, told Insider that his client respects the sentence and is very sorry for his conduct. ""Mr. Wickersham expressed his genuine remorse and accepted responsibility for his actions,"" Noone said. Nearly 730 people have been charged in connection to the Capitol riot so far, and more than 150 people have pleaded guilty.

12/25/2021,"Vox has been planning its vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for more than 30 years, with the initial sketches starting in 1989. What was then a sci-fi concept blossomed into several patents, scaled prototypes and now, the final assembly of its airframe has started and testing is expected to start next year. “Our aircraft can travel at turboprop speeds and land on nearly any helipad in the world,” Brian Morgan, the COO and EVP of engineering at Vox told Robb Report. “Like any helicopter, it provides the flexibility and ease of point-to-point travel, but at two to three times the speed, with more comfort and the ability to fly above weather, all while burning about half the fuel of the same-sized rotorcraft performing the same mission.” More from Robb Report Eviation's New All-Electric Jet Alice Reveals a Plush Executive Interior This Wild Bird-Like eVTOL Can Take Off and Land on Any Kind of Terrain Forget Air Taxis. This Personal Flying Saucer Zings You Through the Air Like a Sci-Fi Hero. The Vox achieves that performance through four turbofans embedded in the “strake” wings to provide lift for takeoffs and landings while offering aerodynamic and safety advantages. A separate rear rotor system produces forward thrust. “We preferred a fixed-wing design,” says Morgan. “It provides dedicated lift and thrust so you’re never unsupported.” Courtesy Vox The power train will be hybrid in the sense of having electric lift rotor assemblies, while still employing turboshaft thrusters for the most efficient and longer-range flight. The battery bank provides about eight minutes of power, with about the same amount of time in reserve. The aircraft recharges in forward flight. “A mix of multiple systems will work together to optimize power needs and flexibility for the different modes of flight,” Morgan says. “The precise combination and scaling of each are dependent on the mission profile.” Vox is exploring SAF and hydrogen options, but starting with conventional fuel, the VTOL will go about 400 miles at 300 knots with an 800-pound load. A 250kW all-electric version will have a range of about 180 to 200 miles. The large fixed wing also creates a 17-1 glide ratio, providing extra safety in the event of engine failure. Courtesy Lux The dual-power system and enclosed rotors can be employed in several different air frames, so Vox is developing everything from drone-sized versions to a mid-size business jet. The company hopes to get airborne in 2022 and reach certification by 2026. “We’re a fixed-wing VTOL with long range and high speed,” says Morgan. “We looking to fit into the regional travel portion of the market.” Best of Robb Report The Chevy C8 Corvette: Everything We Know About the Powerful Mid-Engine Beast The World’s Best Superyacht Shipyards The ABCs of Chartering a Yacht Sign up for Robb Report's Newsletter.

12/25/2021,"If 2021 gave us anything, besides an endless pandemic, a supply chain crisis, inflation, and, well…you get it, it was the mainstreaming of the term Web3. A largely nebulous concept, Web3 is being trumpeted by crypto and blockchain boosters as the future of the internet. The idea is to create a decentralized web, where users can transport their data from service to service without corporate walled gardens stopping them. It’s a soup of much-hyped tech terms ranging from NFTs to the metaverse that captured the attention of powerful venture capital firms. But it’s also found critics in some big names including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who told The Babylon Bee on Wednesday that it “sounds like more marketing than reality.” So is Web3 just jargon crypto bros are foisting on us? Or is it a new kind of internet that will change the world? The truth is, it’s a little of both. Before we dive into the potential benefits and pitfalls of Web3, let’s go over why it’s called Web3. That name stems from Web1 or Web 1.0, the name for the original version of the internet that let you browse GeoCities sites or play silly Flash-based browser games. If you’re in your early 20s, this was essentially the Stone Age of the internet. Also, if you’re in your early 20s, I despise you for your youth. Web2, otherwise known as Web 2.0, evolved from Web1 and featured the growth of social media platforms like Facebook, services like Uber and Venmo, and well, more or less everything that exists online today. Web3, which I guess sounds cooler than Web 3.0, is the next evolution of the internet. An outgrowth of Web 2.0, it’s based on the idea that blockchain tech and digital tokens can foster a decentralized internet. While Web 2.0 gave us the internet as we know it, it also brought heavy baggage. Just a handful of gargantuan companies control the web, whether that’s Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), or Facebook (FB), and they’re happy to keep it that way. There’s a lack of data portability, the ability to bring your information with you across devices. And if you purchase an app through one platform, it might not work on other platforms. Big name tech companies also thrive on the data you give them. After all, Google and Facebook make the vast majority of their revenue from advertisements based on user information. Web3, however, would allow sites and services to exist across decentralized computer networks and rely on blockchain technology to validate user data. The people who actually use sites and apps would then, ideally, own them. Participate in an online community enough, and you’d get a piece of it in the form of a digital token. Consumers, rather than a large corporation, would govern the service. Right, the metaverse. That’s the interconnected online worlds that everyone from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Epic Games’ Tim Sweeney have obsessed over. For the metaverse to exist as a group of expansive online worlds, you’ll need to seamlessly bring your user account, avatar, and data from place to place. Individual companies owning various parts of the metaverse would likely make that impossible. Do you really think Meta is going to want to share its users with Roblox (RBLX) and Epic Games? No way. That’s where the decentralized internet of Web3 comes in. If there’s no single entity controlling the sites and apps that make up the metaverse, users can jump from world to world with ease. How would you pay for everything in Web3? With cryptocurrencies, of course. That has naturally brought crypto fans along for the ride. Web3 advocates will say the concept will be the dominant form of the internet going forward. But really, it’ll likely just be an amalgam of Web1, Web 2.0, and Web3. Big Tech companies have already invested in Web3. Do you expect trillion-dollar companies that make up the larger internet ecosystem to give up their control? Come on. The truth is Web3 isn’t some new version of the internet we’ll have to pack up and move to. It’s a growth of our current internet. And it’ll likely be a gradual transition that you hardly notice. After all, you don’t remember the moment we transitioned from Web1 to Web 2.0. Right? And while there’s the potential for innovative changes like giving people more control over the services they visit the most, I wouldn’t expect the utopian paradise Web3 boosters promise. Yes, the internet will soon change, but it’s not as though it hasn’t been changing this entire time.
