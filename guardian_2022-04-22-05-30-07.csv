4/22/2022,"When Captain Cook spent time in Fiji in 1774, he and his crew were astounded by the “drua” – double-hulled boats that were then some of the most advanced sea vessels in the world. Elegant in their simplicity, they were created by binding together buabua trees, not with nails but by “magimagi”, or coconut fibres. Over time, this shipbuilding genius went into decline, but nearly 250 years later, Fijians re-emerged as the world’s best – not in the water this time, but on the rugby sevens field. And now, in 2022, the ancient trailblazers have again risen in the 15-a-side version of the game, courtesy of the Fijiana Drua’s debut in the women’s Super W competition. While the Fijian Drua men’s team have struggled on their way to a 1-7 record – their best players have been poached for years by Australian, New Zealand and UK teams – the women’s team have swept all before them in their inaugural Super W year, playing a brand of entertaining rugby that would make their pioneering ancestors weep with pleasure. These Drua are bound not by coconut fibres but by faith and the “veilomani” spirit – a love for each other – and they have revolutionised women’s rugby in Australia with an intoxicating brand of running rugby not seen since the Mark Ella era of the 1980s. They have comprehensively defeated the five established Australian teams and their 5-0 record – and remarkable 184-51 for and against numbers – has earned them the title of minor premiers and a place in Saturday’s grand final against the NSW Waratahs. The Waratahs are well resourced and have been the imposing powerhouse of the Super W competition – they had been undefeated since its inception – but their five-year winning streak was brutally ended by the Drua earlier this month in a 29-10 reverse, with one bewildered TV commentator exclaiming: “This is electric, this is fantastic, I can’t keep up.” The Fijiana Drua revolution began in their first Super W outing at the beginning of March when three front rowers scored their first three tries, including a 65m run by prop Karalaini Naisewa. They overwhelmed the Melbourne Rebels 66-5, leaving Mel Kawa, the disoriented Rebels captain, speechless. “What can I say? I’ve never played 80 minutes of [rugby] sevens before,” she said. “They kept coming.” The team is the most under-resourced team in the competition and their giantkilling feats have provided unbridled joy for patient fans. “We’ve known for a long time that our women are extremely talented,” says Lizann Vailasi, a Fijian Sydneysider who watched the team dismantle the Western Force at Leichhardt Oval in round three. “We knew they would compete in the Super W but they have been a revelation and we can’t stop talking about them.” Beyond jubilant Australian-Fijian fans, the impact in Fiji has been profound according to Fiji rugby union women’s development manager Vela Naucukidi. “Their games are live on TV here in Fiji every weekend, and it’s just amazing,” Naucukidi says. “It helps us who are actually working on the ground trying to develop women’s rugby in Fiji.” While some commentators have made slippery rationalisations that the Fijiana Drua are an international team playing in a provincial competition, the facts tell a different story. Only six of the team have played internationally for Fiji, while the rest of the squad have only been playing the game for between one and three years. Try-scoring machine Vitalina Nakore is a former footballer whilst the ball-handling skills of Akosita Ravato are a recent addendum to her previous career as a basketball player. Also worth noting, in the 15-a-side version of the game, Fiji are ranked 21st in the world, behind non-traditional rugby nations such as Hong Kong, Sweden, Germany and Kazakhstan. Yet the Drua’s rugby has been breathtaking across all facets of the game – high-level conditioning, physical defence, laser-like passing, instinctive and intuitive support play, slick running and clinical finishing. After games they sing hymns for their opponents. It is a total rugby package in the spirit of “the game they play in heaven”. In the final game of the regular season, when the ACT Brumbies tried to strangle the creativity of the Drua’s running game, they showed flexibility and responded with a hard-fought victory based on more traditional set pieces centred on scrums and lineouts. Captain Bitila Tawake has perhaps been the perfect representation of what the Fijiana Drua stand for. Her post match interviews are a mix of humility, shyness, gratitude and joy. Nothing phases her and she is focused on the job at hand: “First we’re just doing things one step at a time,” she says. “We didn’t expect it to be this big and we came in as underdogs in this tournament.” Along with coach Senirusi Seruvakula, Tawake is ensuring the Drua maintain their identity. “We are just doing what we do best with our own free-flowing Fijian style of game – breaking the line, offloading and support play.” Instead of streaking across the Pacific Ocean, the Fijiana Drua are streaking across Australian rugby fields. But both voyages have the same outcome – opening up new possibilities for their people. Awaiting them in the grand final are the wounded Waratahs, who are hoping for revenge and to deliver a winning send-off for their 37-year-old Fijian veteran Iliseva Batibasaga. Either way, the women’s game in Australia will never be the same again.",News/World news,‘We can’t stop talking about them’: Fijian Drua revolutionise women’s rugby in Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/we-cant-stop-talking-about-them-fijian-drua-revolutionise-womens-rugby-in-australia

4/22/2022,"Yet another hidden cost of Covid-19 was revealed on Thursday as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention presented new data showing how the pandemic has dramatically impeded the US effort to vaccinate kids for other diseases. According to the CDC’s report, national vaccine coverage among American children in kindergarten dropped from 95% to below 94% in the past year – which may seem like a small amount but meant 350,000 fewer children were vaccinated against common diseases. “Overall, today’s findings support previous data showing a concerning decline in childhood immunizations that began in March 2020,” Shannon Stokley, the CDC’s immunization services deputy division director, said in a press conference on Thursday. Another 400,000 kids were absent from kindergarten altogether during the 2020-2021 school year, the data showed. “These children too, might not be up to date on their routine vaccinations, further evidence of how pandemic-related disruptions to healthcare and education could have lingering consequences for school-age children,” the CDC report said. Some of the reasons for the lower vaccination rates included reluctance to schedule appointments, reduced access to them, so-called “provisional” school enrollment, the easing of vaccination requirements for remote learners, fewer parents submitting documents and less time for school nurses to follow up with unvaccinated students. States and schools also told the CDC that there were fewer staff members to assess kindergarten vaccination coverage, and a lower response rate from schools, both due to Covid-19. “The CDC provides vaccines for nearly half of America’s children through the Vaccines for Children program,” Stokley said. “And over the last two years, orders for distribution of routine vaccines are down more than 10% compared to before the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are concerned that missed routine vaccinations could leave children vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough which are extremely dangerous and can be very serious, especially for babies and young children.” In a study published last October in JAMA Pediatrics, Black families were found to be less likely to have their children caught up with vaccines, compared with Hispanic or Asian families. “Think about where a lot of the underserved, underprivileged individuals will access care, or try to access care – those institutions that actually went into lockdown,” Terrence Shirley, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Mississippi, told the Guardian last December. Despite the drop in national vaccine rates among children, the CDC said that routine vaccination coverage still remains high, and that “we can recover ground lost during the Covid-19 pandemic.” The agency called for extra effort to catch students up on missed shots and to maintain high rates of routine childhood vaccinations.",News/Society,Pandemic disrupted routine vaccinations of US kindergarteners,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/21/cdc-vaccine-coverage-us-children-kindergarten-decline
4/22/2022,"It may seem as if the UK is undergoing a exceptional run of child deaths: in December the horrific cases of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, and Star Hobson came to light through the courts, followed by that of Kyrell Matthews in March, and now another appalling tragedy, five-year-old Logan Mwangi. Have child deaths by assault and neglect become more common? UK data suggests one child a week is killed in the UK on average, according to the NSPCC, and this has changed little over the last five years. All deaths are devastating and sad but most are barely heard of; only a handful, like these, achieve public and media notoriety. All the above cases stand out for the staggering brutality and viciousness they bear witness to: each unwound a story of abuse, torture, assault and neglect visited on defenceless children by sadistic parents and carers (and in the case of Logan, a teenager who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was also involved). Logan’s lifeless body was found in a river on the morning of 31 July 2021. He had over 50 injuries, including catastrophic damage to his brain and liver and other internal organs. This was the culmination of months of terrifying violence and neglect on the part of his mother, stepfather and the teenager, known as “Boy X”. The awfulness of Logan’s final months contrasted vividly with his innocence and zest for life. He was a friendly, energetic and popular little boy, according to his primary school in Bridgend, Wales. He was bright, happy and inquisitive, the school said in a tribute, “with the kind of smile that could light up a classroom”. Such cases tend to invoke two immediate public responses: despair at the wickedness and inadequacy of the assailants, who often combine immense capacity for inflicting pain with exceptional cunning in covering up their misdeeds; and concern over whether the safeguarding authorities could have done more to prevent the crimes. There will be concern too that these cases signify a pandemic uptick in abuse and violence against children (although Kyrell’s death predated Covid-19). Certainly this has been a period when family stress has proliferated, when safeguarding has become in some ways less vigilant in lockdown, (a factor exploited, it seems, by Logan’s parents) and when vulnerable children have slipped off the radar. Occasionally, such terrible cases lead directly to policy change. The cases of Maria Colwell in 1973, Victoria Climbie in 2000 and Peter Connelly (“Baby P”) in 2008, all led to reforms of the child protection system. The recent cluster of child deaths could have a similar effect; two significant reviews of children’s services are expected to report within weeks. The first, a government review, announced in the wake of the conviction of Arthur’s killers – his mother was found guilty of murder, his stepfather of manslaughter – will look at the lessons to be learned from safeguarding shortcomings in Solihull, where Arthur was killed, and how they could be applied nationally. This is likely to be followed by a separate wide-ranging independent national review of children’s social care, chaired by Josh MacAlister, founder of the Frontline charity. Promised in the 2019 Tory general election manifesto, it was billed as “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to overhaul a system perceived as failing vulnerable young people. Together the reviews will demonstrate many fundamental issues – the adequacy of a system MacAlister has already described as a “tower of Jenga held together by sellotape,” starved of investment for over a decade in which rising child poverty has led to surging numbers of children brought under the auspices of social care. The determination evinced by the perpetrators of these child killings suggests those people could elude even the most alert of systems. But as the child practice review into the death of Kyrell concluded, such cases happen in a “bigger systems context” of staff burnout, high caseloads, crisis management, and inadequate leadership. Fixing this wider context of children’s services will not come cheap, and there are no easy fixes. Responding adequately to the lessons and legacy of Arthur, Star, Kyrell and Logan is shaping up to be one of the most important public policy challenges facing the government.",News/Society,Child deaths by assault: will appalling brutality spur on reviews to fix a failing system?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/21/child-deaths-by-assault-will-appalling-brutality-spur-on-reviews-to-fix-a-failing-system
4/22/2022,"Computer hard drives that were smashed up by Guardian executives to avoid handing over leaked classified documents to the government are on public display in a new exhibition about the media and society over the past 500 years. Breaking the News, which opens at the British Library on Friday, raises challenging questions for historians, social commentators and news gatherers as well as the wider population who learn about events through mainstream and social media. Drawing on archive material held by the library, including 450m pages from newspapers from 1619 to the present day, the exhibition highlights issues of truth and trust in the media, censorship and suppression, ethics, distortion and partisanship. Luke McKernan, the lead curator of the exhibition, said: “There has never been a time when news has been so hotly debated, so sought after and so diverse in its forms. Each story in the exhibition tells us something different about why the news matters.” The exhibition, which has taken four years to put together, examined “the forces that drive news; the inter-relationship between those providing and those consuming news; fake news, ‘alternative facts’ and what is truth,” he added. “It doesn’t answer questions about these issues; rather it comes up with more questions.” The exhibition is arranged thematically rather than chronologically. The Guardian’s hard drives, destroyed by angle grinders and drills while watched by two technicians from GCHQ, the government spy agency, are in a section on public interest. The documents in question came from Edward Snowden, a National Security Agency contractor, in 2013 as part of the biggest ever leak of western intelligence. The Guardian destroyed the computers after the government explicitly threatened the paper with an injunction to return the material, citing national and international security. The paper argued its revelations of surveillance and breaches of privacy were in the public interest. The Trial of Oscar Wilde by the Illustrated Police News in 1895 One of the greatest celebrity scandals of the Victorian age, which sparked a frenzy of newspaper coverage Newsreel footage of 'the Titanic' Shown amid great appetite for information after the luxury liner sank in 1912, the footage was actually of the Titanic’s sister ship. Occupation of Guernsey in the second world war The cover of the Guernsey Evening Press on 1 July 1940 listed the 'Orders of the commandant of the German forces in occupation of the island of Guernsey'. By 1942, the Guernsey Underground News Service (Guns) had started the illegal distribution of BBC news reports, printed on tomato packing paper. Sunday Times scoop of the century The diaries of Adolf Hitler, 'discovered' in 1983, were exposed as forgeries after the paper ran its 'world exclusive'. Final edition of the News of the World 'Thank You and Goodbye', said the front page on 10 July 2007. Rupert Murdoch closed the paper after revelations that journalists had hacked the phones of public and private figures. A section on “Disaster” includes footage of furious and distressed residents of Grenfell Tower and its neighbouring homes, accusing journalists of failing to report residents’ warnings that the building was unsafe. “You only come when we die,” says one person in the aftermath of the 2017 fire that killed 72 people and destroyed the 24-storey block of flats in west London. “Conflict” includes the BBC Home Service broadcast on 6 June 1944, in which details of the D-day landings were released to the public, and the war correspondent Marie Colvin’s emotional report for Channel 4 News on the Syrian government’s bombing of Homs in 2012. Colvin was killed the next day. A section called “Chaos” draws a link between the English civil war in the 1640s and recent reporting of the Brexit campaign. “Both happened at times when new types of media were emerging and old models of control collapsed, resulting in division and chaos,” says the explanatory board. Partisanship in the media is illustrated by contrasting front page reports of the anti-fascist Battle of Cable Street in 1936. The Daily Worker, then the paper of the Communist party, headlined its coverage: “East London routs the Fascists”. The Blackshirt, the paper of the British Union of Fascists, hailed a victory against the “Red Mob”. The exhibition also looks at the media and the public’s unwavering interest in crime and celebrity, the power of language, satire, and issues around verification. The oldest item on display is the earliest surviving printed news report, on the Battle of Flodden in 1513. The most recent is a live feed of trending news stories at this moment, whenever that is. The British Library is partnering with about 50 libraries around the UK that will display material from the London exhibition alongside locally sourced material. Samira Ahmed, the chair of a panel that advised on the exhibition, said it showed “how news has always connected us as citizens, from Tudor times to the present. It shows how confronting the truth, sometimes in the face of official censorship and control, is so valuable.” Breaking the News is at the British Library in St Pancras, London, until 22 August.",News/Media,Smashed Guardian hard drives feature in British Library exhibition,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/21/smashed-guardian-hard-drives-feature-in-british-library-exhibition
4/22/2022,"Florida Republicans approved a new congressional map that severely curtails Black voting power in the state on Thursday, taking a final vote as Black lawmakers staged a sit-in on the floor of the legislature. The new plan, which was drawn by Governor Ron DeSantis, gives Republicans a significant boost in the state and is one of the most aggressively gerrymandered maps passed in recent months. Republicans would be expected to win 20 of the state’s 28 congressional districts, a four seat increase from the 16 they hold now. It also eliminates two of four districts where Black voters have been able to elect the candidate of their choice. DeSantis is expected to sign the districts into law, and lawsuits challenging the maps are immediately expected. “We are plainly in this map denying minority voters the ability to elect the representative of their choice,” said state representative Fentrice Driskell, a Democrat who represents the Tampa area. Black Democratic lawmakers halted the final debate of the bill Thursday morning just before noon. They took over the floor of the legislature, leading prayer and chants. One member, state representative Dianne Hart, was seen wiping tears from her eyes during the protest, according to the Miami Herald. The Sergeant at Arms removed an Associated Press photographer from the floor of the legislature while the demonstration was ongoing, the Miami Herald reported. The legislature reconvened and held a final vote on the maps while the protest was continuing, according to The Tributary. A focal point of the new maps has been the way it eliminates the fifth congressional district, which stretches from Jacksonville to Tallahassee. 46% of that district is currently Black, and it is represented by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat. DeSantis has openly called for getting rid of the district, saying it is unusually shaped and was unlawfully drawn based on race. After vetoing a proposal that would have allowed Black voters in Jacksonville to continue to elect the candidate of their choice, DeSantis’s map breaks up the district into four pieces in which Black voters comprise a much smaller share of the population. DeSantis and lawyers from his office have said the law allows them to dismantle the district, voting rights experts have said the plan brazenly disregards laws designed to protect the interests of minority voters. Republicans would be favored to win all of those districts. At one point during the debate on Thursday, Representative Randy Fine, a Republican who was the vice-chair of the redistricting committee, explained why he was opposed to drawing districts that prevented minorities from electing candidates of their choice if they don’t comprise a majority of voters. “When we guarantee that a group of people gets to select the candidate of their choice, what we’re saying is we’re guaranteeing that those who aren’t part of that group get no say. Chew on that one for a little bit,” he said. The 1965 Voting Rights Act was designed to prevent this kind of voting discrimination, ensuring that lawmakers could not split up sizable and compact minority communities to dilute their vote. “They’re trying to see what they can get away with,” said Stuart Naifeh, a lawyer at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. “It’s pretextual to say that the district doesn’t make sense. He wants to dismantle a Democratic district, and in this case a Democratic district that’s been held for a Black person for a long time and that’s a majority-minority district. So it’s concerning that he’s diluting minority voting strength.” “It seems like it’s got all the hallmarks of intentional discrimination,” he said.",News/US news,Florida Republicans pass congressional map severely limiting Black voter power,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/21/florida-republicans-pass-map-limits-black-voter-power
4/22/2022,"More than 160 passengers who were on a train that was attacked in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna last month remain missing or unaccounted for, as details of possible collaboration between Boko Haram jihadists and local bandits have emerged. Ten people were killed, two in the weeks since the attack on 28 March, when gunmen bombed the rail tracks, derailing the train before gunning down passengers and train staff, and abducting scores of people. The Nigerian Railway Corporation that runs the train service said earlier this month that 168 people were unaccounted for, including over 140 passengers it had not been able to reach through registered contacts. At least one person has paid a ransom and been released. A relative of two of the victims said families were not aware of any other freed captives by the assailants. On Thursday, a spokesperson said that while there had not been an update on the number of passengers missing in two weeks – to the anguish of relatives – new information would be announced soon. The attack was just one of many by armed groups targeting major transport links and communities across northern Nigeria in recent years and was the most significant targeting the train line between Abuja and a major city in northern Nigeria since it began operating in 2016. The rail attack, like many incidents in the region, was initially suspected to be carried out by one of the so-called “bandit” terror groups, possibly by mainly ethnic Fulani gunmen who have launched deadly attacks from hideouts in a forested expanse stretching across northwest Nigeria and into the Sahel. The groups, some heavily armed and coordinated, have grown more deadly than jihadist groups. They emerged from a worsening conflict with farmers over encroachments on private farmland by pastoralists and disputes over land. Population growth, rural development and the climate crisis have fuelled a scarcity of land to graze cattle for herders, as historic grazing routes have vanished. But in recent weeks, government officials and security experts have raised alarm at the involvement of jihadist groups, thought to be increasingly active in north west and central Nigeria. The region has become a nexus for several armed groups and an escape for jihadists facing more intense pressure from the Nigerian army in the northeast, but where insurgency continues to devastate lives. On Thursday, Islamic State West Africa Province (Iswap), claimed responsibility for an explosion that it said killed or injured 30 people at a market where alcohol was sold in the eastern state of Taraba State, marking an expansion of the area where the extremist group has operated in. Local government officials have said terror units, aligned with Boko Haram or Iswap are controlling rural communities as far south as Niger state, neighbouring the capital Abuja. Nigeria’s minister of information and culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said last week that what was happening, “is a kind of an unholy handshake between bandits and Boko Haram insurgents”. “Preliminary reports of what transpired at the Kaduna train attacks showed that there is a kind of collaboration between the bandits and the dislodged Boko Haram terrorists from the northeast. I can tell you very confidently that the federal government is on top of this matter,” he said. Earlier this month, an unverified video circulating on social media appeared to show the attackers and dozens of abducted victims, some put forward to plead with the government for their lives. In the video, the assailants spoke in Hausa, saying the government knew their demands. Yusuf Anka, a researcher based in Zamfara, northwest Nigeria said Ansaru – a Boko Haram unit in the region – had collaborated with bandits to stage the attack on the train, and that the group was seeking the release of their members detained by Nigerian authorities. “If their demands are met, and the prisoners are freed, it will be the first successful negotiation in the northwest for these jihadist elements.” To ordinary people, attacks by bandits or jihadists were increasingly indistinguishable, he said. While in some areas jihadists have clashed with bandits, in some cases, they were working together. “There are also times where you will see cooperation between them, when attacking government institutions, especially the military or in attacks for financial motives,” Anka said. Attempts by jihadist groups to rally bandits to their cause had largely failed, with jihadists often positioning themselves to local communities as guardians, offering protection, alternative governance and Sharia law in communities where bandits were intent on attacking. Meanwhile, survivors and relatives of victims of the train attack have continued to express anguish. One railway worker hid in the toilet along with two other employees when the train derailed, praying quietly, trying not to cry or make a sound as gunmen began shooting passengers on carriages. “I’m still experiencing the trauma. I even had to move from Kaduna because I couldn’t sleep there anymore,” said the worker, who asked not to be named. Four rail staff, friends of his, had been kidnapped, he said. Their relatives were desperately trying to raise ransom funds for their release, after almost a month in captivity. In Abuja, over the last few weeks, a group made up of families of the kidnapped victims has held press conferences and marches, pleading with the government to help. “There’s a seven-month pregnant woman, who only gives birth through cesarean section, only God knows what she’s going through … There’s a toddler who is twoyearsold for God’s sake,” a relative said, fighting back tears while others wept around him. Many of the now frequent mass abductions and killings in Nigeria do not draw an official response from the federal government. When they do, such as after the train attack, President Muhammadu Buhari, pledged again to bring the attackers to justice. Yet, relatives of victims have bemoaned that the government and security agencies rarely communicate updates and the government has maintained it does not pay ransoms. Families lament that even after victims negotiate directly with militants, security agencies do not collect information about the assailants from the families or the rescued abductees.
