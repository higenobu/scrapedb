4/25/2022,"Female MPs have long endured misogyny and sexism both in the media and at the hands of fellow male politicians. The attack on Angela Rayner is just the latest. Politicians and the public roundly criticised a 2017 Daily Mail headline alongside a photo of the then prime minster, Theresa May, and the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, sitting together during difficult talks, which read: “Never mind Brexit, who won Legs-it!” Inside it read: “Finest weapons at their command? Those pins!” while the columnist Sarah Vine opined that Sturgeon’s legs were “altogether more flirty, tantalisingly crossed … a direct attempt at seduction”. The Labour MP Harriet Harman labelled the article “moronic”, while the then opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: “This sexism should be consigned to history”. The former Labour Leader Ed Miliband tweeted: “The 1950s called and asked for their headline back.” His party colleague Yvette Cooper wrote: “It’s 2017. Two women’s decisions will determine if United Kingdom continues to exist. And the front page news is their lower limbs. Obviously.” Jacqui Smith’s first Commons statement in 2007 caused comment in many newspapers, not for what she said, but for what she wore. Or, as one publication put it, “the amount of cleavage she had on show”. Smith later told BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour that combating terrorism and crime were her priorities – not her clothing. Numerous publications addressed the theme. The Daily Mail weighed in with “The great cleavage divide”, and pitted Smith against May, then the shadow leader of the house. Might May be wearing a “leopard skin bra”? it queried. “Her display of cleavage on Wednesday looked like a direct challenge to the bold front sometimes displayed by the home secretary, Jacqui Smith,” its columnist wrote. In 2015, the issue was raised again when the shadow minister Alison McGovern was chastised by a party member for her “prominent cleavage” and “attention-seeking outfit” following a TV debate on Channel 4 News. David Cameron was roundly criticised in 2011 when during PMQs he told the shadow Treasury secretary, Angela Eagle, to “calm down, dear”. Downing Street batted it off as just a “humorous remark”. But Harman decried “his patronising and outdated attitude to women” and his “contemptuous response”. Eagle told the BBC: “I don’t think a modern man would have expressed himself in that way. What I was trying to do was point out he had got some facts wrong.” She added: “I have been patronised by better people than the prime minister.” Boris Johnson, as foreign secretary, was slapped down in 2018 for referring to his shadow counterpart, Emily Thornberry, by her husband’s title rather than her name. Answering Thornberry, whose high court judge husband is a knight, Johnson referred to her as “Baroness, whatever it is, I cannot remember what it is … Nugee”. The then Commons Speaker, John Bercow, said: “We do not address people by the title of their spouses. The shadow foreign secretary has a name, and it is not ‘Lady something’. We know what her name is. It is inappropriate and frankly sexist to speak in those terms, and I am not having it in this chamber.” Johnson subsequently apologised for his “inadvertent sexism”. William Hague came under fire as foreign secretary in 2013 after twice appearing to mutter “stupid woman” during PMQs when the shadow Treasury minister Cathy Jamieson questioned his links with Conservative donors and private companies. As Cameron responded, Hague was seen to mouth the words, but said later he had intended no offence. Jamieson told the Huffington Post: “It would have been better for the prime minister to give the house the reassurance I sought than have the foreign secretary muttering insults from the sideline.” The Labour MP Michael McCann condemned the words as “scandalous” while the Labour MEP David Martin demanded Hague apologise. In 2011 a laughing Cameron caused his own backbencher Nadine Dorries to storm out of the Commons chamber as MPs brayed at the hint of innuendo. Dorries had asked a question during PMQs about how much influence on government policy was enjoyed by the Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg. A joking Cameron replied that he knew she was “extremely frustrated”. On hearing the laughter of fellow MPs, he continued: “Maybe I should start all over again.” Though his aides were later keen to stress his answer was meant to be a “lighthearted joke”, the exchange was seen by some as fuelling accusations of sexism in the chamber.",News/Politics,"From ‘Legs-it’ to ‘calm down, dear’: six times UK MPs have faced sexism",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/legs-it-calm-down-dear-six-times-uk-mps-faced-sexism-angela-rayner
4/25/2022,"Emmanuel Macron is expected to announce a new prime minister in the coming days as he turns his focus to legislative elections in June after his defeat of Marine Le Pen in the presidential runoff on Sunday. The current prime minister, Jean Castex, has said he will resign along with the government, allowing the Macron to choose a fresh face and team for his second five-year terms in office. Analysts suggest Macron may name Élisabeth Borne, the minister for work, as prime minister, only the second woman in France to hold the post. Others being touted for the Hôtel de Matignon – Paris’s equivalent of No 10 – include the finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, the interior minister Gérald Darmanin, or the agriculture minister, Julien Denormandie. Even before it was announced that Macron had been re-elected president on Sunday, attention had turned to the next electoral cycle. He will need his party, La République en Marche!, and its allies to achieve a majority to avoid the formation of a hostile government that could paralyse his programme. The task of appointing a new prime minister and cabinet is made particularly tricky as Macron will be looking to appeal to radical-left voters who backed Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round of the presidential election while avoiding alienating supporters of Le Pen. Macron is facing demands to show he is president of “all the French” after winning 58.54% – compared with Le Pen’s 41.46% – of the vote in Sunday’s second-round vote. His victory will be officially confirmed by the country’s Constitutional Council on Wednesday. Castex could have been asked to stay on as prime minister, but told French radio earlier this month that France would be looking for a “new driving force” if Macron won. Mélenchon, who narrowly missed beating Le Pen in the first round of the presidential election, has called for voters to make him prime minister via the legislative elections on 12 and 19 June. Members of Mélenchon’s party, La France Insoumise (LFI), have been holding “negotiations” with their counterparts at the Ecology-Green and the Communist parties with a view to joining forces in constituencies where a leftwing alliance could win enough seats to give them control of Assemblée Nationale, the lower house. Three political forces have emerged in France after the decline of the traditional centre-right Les Républicains and the centre-left Socialist Party: a pro-European centre represented by Macron’s LREM flanked by a radical left represented by Mélenchon and Le Pen’s far right. Voters who reject Macron, but find the extremes hard to stomach – including the Greens – will have to choose a camp. Manon Aubry, a LFI MEP, said: “We will create a union around a programme and a project. There are now three blocs in the country, the extreme right, the liberal right and our bloc. “We have united lots of people behind us in this election and we can do more to give those who feel orphaned a place in our family. That’s what the negotiations are about.” On Sunday night, Macron’s representatives and members of his cabinet all faced the same question: who will be prime minister? All gave the same answer: It’s for the president to decide. Élisabeth Borne, 61The employment minister, who was previously at the ecology and transport ministries, is a technocrat and former head of the Paris region’s public transport system (RATP). She has served under the Socialist prime minister Lionel Jospin, and has been credited with a firm grasp on most subjects. Borne would be the second female French PM after Édith Cresson, who served for less than a year in office under President François Mitterrand between May 1991 and April 1992. Bruno Le Maire, 53The finance minister and former European affairs minister has the advantage of being on the right of centre and a traditionalist. He has been praised for his economic handling of Macron’s “whatever it costs” approach to the Covid crisis. Considered a loyal convert to Macronism despite having served in Nicolas Sarkozy’s government. Richard Ferrand, 59A former member of the Socialist party and a former journalist, he was general secretary of Macron’s new party and was named minister of territorial cohesion after Macron became president in 2017, but resigned after a month to become head of the LREM group in the Assemblée Nationale, a post he has held since. Julien Denormandie, 41The agriculture minister is often said to be a slightly younger Macron, albeit only by three years. Denormandie served as deputy chief of staff to Macron at the finance ministry when Socialist François Hollande was president. He helped set up La République en Marche! in 2016. Gérald Darmanin, 39The interior ministry is considered rightwing and is often wrongly accused of calling Le Pen “soft” on immigration, which was a sarcastic comment made during a debate. A divisive figure for the left and even among his colleagues, but ambitious. Édouard Philippe, 51The mayor of Le Havre served as Macron’s first prime minister between 2017 and 2020. A former Socialist then member of the centre-right UMP, Philippe had to handle the gilets jaunes movement, strikes and protests over Macron’s controversial pension changes and the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. He resigned after the 2020 municipal elections and began his own political movement, Horizons, that many believe will be his springboard to a centre-right presidential bid in 2027. Christine Lagarde, 66The head of the European Central Bank and former director general of the International Monetary Fund, she was Sarkozy’s economy minister. Lagarde has the experience and the competence but would be rejected as too economically liberal and globalist by the left, so would be an extremely divisive choice. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, 70The LFI leader has demanded French voters make him PM in the forthcoming legislative elections after he narrowly missed out on the second-round presidential runoff by 420,000 votes. Detests Macron and would do all to stymie his programme. Not happening now and will only happen if he forces Macron’s hand by winning a parliamentary majority in June.",News/World news,Macron set to name France’s next PM as focus moves to legislative elections,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/macron-set-to-name-frances-next-pm-as-focus-moves-to-legislative-elections
4/25/2022,"Girls born in the poorest areas of England will have almost 20 fewer years of good health compared with those in the wealthiest, according to figures that also reveal overall life expectancy in the most deprived areas has dropped significantly. Female healthy life expectancy at birth in the most deprived areas was 19.3 years less than in the least deprived areas in 2018 to 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). For males it was 18.6 years less. Last week the Guardian revealed that women in the poorest areas of England were dying earlier than the average female in almost every comparable country. MPs and health experts described the revelation as devastating and unacceptable. Now the ONS figures show life expectancy in the most deprived areas of England fell significantly in the three years to 2020, and the inequality gap to people living in the least deprived areas grew wider. The start of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020 is likely to have influenced the changes in life expectancy, with the most deprived areas experiencing the highest rates of deaths from the virus. It is too soon for the data to reflect the full impact of Covid-19, however. Women and men living in the most deprived areas of England both saw a significant decrease in life expectancy between 2015-17 and 2018-20, the ONS said. For females, life expectancy at birth in 2018-20 was 78.3 years, down from 78.7 in 2015-17. For males it fell from 74 to 73.5 years. David Finch, the assistant director of healthy lives at the Health Foundation, said the data highlighted that there had been greater falls in life expectancy in the poorest areas of England than in the wealthiest. “It also highlights that in the most deprived areas, people are living more of their life in ill health,” he said. “Girls born in the poorest areas of England live 19 fewer years in good health than those born in the wealthiest. A staggering difference in life chances.” Finch said reducing the stark inequalities required a “fundamental shift” to a whole-government approach that fosters the conditions needed for good health, such as adequate incomes to cope with the rising cost of living, secure jobs and decent housing. “The upcoming disparities white paper presents a clear opportunity to move beyond the rhetoric and into action,” he said. The ONS figures also show statistically significant increases in inequality in life expectancy at birth for both sexes. Men in the most deprived areas of England were living 9.7 years fewer than those in the least deprived areas in 2018-20, compared with a difference of 9.3 years in 2015-17. The gap for women was 7.9 years in 2018-20, up from 7.5. Not only do men and women in the most deprived areas have shorter life spans overall but they also live a larger number of years in poorer states of health. In 2018 to 2020, male healthy life expectancy at birth in the most deprived areas of England was estimated at 52.3 years, compared with 70.5 in the least deprived areas. The gap for females was even wider, at 51.9 versus 70.7 years. Years spent in poorer health fell progressively from the most deprived areas (21.2 years for males, 26.4 years for females) to the least deprived areas (12.7 and 15.6 years respectively). The ONS said: “With those living in more deprived areas also living shorter lives, this means that they spend a smaller proportion of their lives in good health.”",News/Society,Growing gap in healthy life expectancy between poorest and richest in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/25/growing-gap-in-healthy-life-expectancy-between-poorest-and-richest-in-england
4/25/2022,"The Conservative party is in a state of paralysis. Boris Johnson wants to move on from Partygate, but every time he tries, the topic comes back to bite him – and it will keep doing so given there are now three inquiries into it. The bulk of Tory MPs don’t want to publicly back their leader on the issue, but they also currently don’t want to go so far as to oust him and trigger a leadership contest. The stalemate is causing frustration on both sides. “They should either shit or get off the pot,” a supporter of the prime minister puts it bluntly. “We’re in no man’s land,” says a Tory MP. This tension was evident last week when the government had to U-turn over a vote brought by Labour to refer Johnson for a Commons investigation into whether he misled the House. After those with government roles suggested they would not vote to block it, MPs were given a free vote – now Johnson faces yet another inquiry. It also ended up dominating Johnson’s trip to India, which aides had hoped would show the prime minister was getting on with the job. “I think it’s fair to say the new political team in No 10 and the whips’ office haven’t demonstrated any evidence that they can rise to difficult political occasions,” argues a senior party figure. The threat of more fines still dangles over Johnson, next month’s local elections are being talked up by MPs as a referendum on Partygate, Sue Gray’s report into the whole affair is still to be published (with a source telling the Times that it’s so bad he could be forced to go) and the new inquiry by the privileges committee on whether he is in contempt of parliament isn’t expected to conclude until the autumn. “The problem is there’s no end in sight,” sighs a senior Tory. When it comes to the groups of most concern to the whips, the one viewed as the most anti-Johnson is the One Nation set of Conservative MPs. A recent policy shift to the right – Channel 4 privatisation, sending Channel migrants to Rwanda – has only exacerbated this. Then there’s unhappy members of the 2019 intake who feel pushed around by No 10. While there could be enough numbers in these two groups – along with a few others – to trigger a confidence vote, they would need more people on side to come close to winning it. They may also lack organisation. “The One Nationers aren’t very machiavellian. They’re not master plotters,” says one member of the 2019 intake. So far, the strategy has been to shore up support for the prime minister by making sure those on the right are onside. Steve Baker’s call for Johnson to go suggests this approach is facing difficulties. In addition, the quiet middle are growing anxious. “I thought it was going to be fine, but I’m getting messages from a lot of MPs who are usually loyal saying they don’t like where this is going,” says one Tory MP. Yet for all the bad news heading Johnson’s way, there are still a few key reasons that his demise is no sure bet. The biggest is that MPs do not have an obvious candidate to replace him. This was still the case earlier this year – but the implosion of Rishi Sunak over his wife’s non-dom tax status means that the most obvious candidate is no longer viewed as viable, at least in the short term. More and more, the talk is that Jeremy Hunt is the best placed candidate. His supporters – many of whom sit on the One Nation wing of the party – argue that the former foreign secretary has the required cabinet experience, and unlike the others is not tainted or brought down by Johnson. “Boris has a morally disintegrative effect on everyone who comes into contact with him,” says a former minister. Yet the more MPs talk up Hunt, the more those on the right of the party start to think they’d better stick with the devil they know. ‘“A Jeremy Hunt premiership terrifies the party,” says a member of the 2019 intake. There are doubts that Hunt – a key player in the David Cameron and Theresa May governments – would win the party a fifth term or keep the new coalition together. What’s more, while next month’s local elections are being talked up as a trigger point, expectations are rock bottom for the Tories – just look at Labour figures attempting to talk down their prospects in the media. “One of the things we are holding on to at the moment is that Keir still hasn’t managed to land a killer punch,” says a party figure. Over the weekend, supportive Tory MPs have been filling the various WhatsApp groups with anecdotes from the campaign trail – claiming constituents are saying the party had better stick with Johnson. This has met a mixed reaction. The biggest issue for Johnson is that events around Partygate are largely out of his control. Many MPs in the middle of the party have decided to stick with him for now – but the reason they are silent when it comes to a public intervention is they could change that position if more comes out. Remember that Dominic Cummings – the prime minister’s former aide turned tormentor in chief – claimed in February when one picture was published: “There’s waaaaay better pics than that floating around, incl in the flat.” The main sense among Conservative MPs is they just want the whole story to go away – part of the reason the mood in the party began to improve during the Ukraine crisis was that it led to a period where every political interview wasn’t about parties. If MPs start to conclude that it is impossible to do this under Johnson, their calculation to keep him in place could change. Events could yet overtake the prime minister.

4/25/2022,"More than one in seven private tenants are “overpaying” to secure a rental property, often because they are desperate or there is nothing else available, research suggests. Average UK rents have increased for the sixth quarter in a row as shortages of available properties continue to drive up costs, according to the Deposit Protection Service (DPS), a government-authorised scheme that keeps tenants’ deposits safe. It found that the typical rent paid in the first three months of this year was 6.1% higher than 12 months earlier and stood at £849 a month – up from £800. It added that for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, flats were the property type showing the biggest rise in rents, which it said “could signal the beginning of the end of the pandemic trend of renters leaving cities”. The report is the latest in a line of surveys showing that intense competition in the rental market is adding to the financial strain being felt by many households. Earlier this month the property website Rightmove said private rents were rising at a record rate, and prospective tenants outnumbered available rental properties by more than three to one. The DPS – which says its database of private rental prices is the largest of its kind – said a survey of tenants it carried out earlier this year found that 15% of respondents said they had paid more than the advertised rent to secure their property. Of those, more than two in five (43%) said they had paid over the odds because they were “desperate to secure a property”, while 26% said there was nothing else on the market. A further 11% said the agent had asked them for their “best offer”, another 11% said they overpaid because they loved the property, and the remaining 9% did not give a reason for overpaying. The DPS said across the UK the picture was one of strong rental growth, with an increase in average rents in all regions between the first quarter of last year and the same period this year. Ten of the 12 UK regions experienced increases of more than 4%, with the West Midlands topping the table at almost 8%. Matt Trevett, the managing director at the DPS, said: “Consistent quarterly rent rises – coupled with survey results that suggest that a proportion of tenants are overpaying to secure a property – underline the current intense demand for, and tight supply of, rental homes in the UK.” Rents in London – which fell out of favour with many tenants during the first year of the pandemic – were also rebounding strongly, he added, with the average monthly cost of a flat in the capital increasing by £111, or almost 9%, in the space of a year to reach £1,416.",Lifestyle/Money,Renting: more than one in seven UK private tenants ‘overpaying’,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/25/renting-more-than-one-in-seven-uk-private-tenants-overpaying
4/25/2022,"Welcome to Donetsk You teach me this wartime trick –to look for living pot plantsin the windows on Kievska Avenue.Most are crisped and brown. But one green geraniumand a succulent spider plantoffer proof of lifefor the person who waters them. Whole apartment blocks are abandoned.Collapsed telephone lines,blown-up brancheslitter the road. No voices,no tinkering metalwork in the distance,no buses, no playing children.Leaves rustle white noise. You say, It’s like Sunday every day.Stray dogs and swallows,and the soft thud of shelling. Welcome to Donetsk is from One Language, a collection of poems with additional short prose and photographs by the English-Swedish photojournalist Anastasia Taylor-Lind (who won the Poetry Business International Book and Pamphlet competition in 2021). Welcome to Donetsk responds to the earlier conflict in Ukraine, ignited in 2014 by the seizure of the Donbas region by Russian-backed separatists. Now Taylor-Lind is once more in the country to cover the war. The title Welcome to Donetsk quotes the postcard that is the closing image of the section, Stories, in which Welcome to Donetsk appears. Recalling a time when the city would have had tourists and visitors, the postcard view reveals the river-threaded spaciousness of Donetsk, the fifth largest city in Ukraine, with a foreground of rocks and greenery that, off camera, will blend ultimately into the grasslands of the steppe. Addressing perhaps a friend or colleague who has been showing the newly arrived photojournalist around, Welcome to Donetsk focuses on the plants in apartment block windows. To read the plants is a “wartime trick” for finding out if the inhabitants are still alive and present. The plants are mostly “crisped and brown”. If, rarely, they’re green, they “offer proof of life / for the person who waters them”. The syntax here complicates the statement that the watered plants prove the person who cares for them is alive, suggesting the plants are themselves offering a reassuring “proof of life” to their beleaguered owners. As the scene develops, the possible explanation as to why Taylor-Lind decided to introduce poems into her photographic record emerges. The focus expands beyond the images of resiliently green geranium and spider plants to consider the sounds of the street. Sound dominates the last two stanzas, layering the rustled “white noise” of the leaves with noises no longer actually audible, but able to be evoked by skilfully used language. In the lines noting the absence of sounds – “no voices, / no tinkering metalwork in the distance” – “tinkering” is a neat coinage, capturing the tinkling of lightly hammered metalwork as well as the useful pleasure of “tinkering” with machines and gadgets – a noise which would mean “business as usual” in the factory or domestic back yard. A Sunday-like absence of human activity becomes more desolate with the image of the city street given over to “Stray dogs and swallows” and the accompanying “soft thud of shelling” in the distance. This is the line that almost inconspicuously, with hushed consonants, inserts the truth of the situation. The writer responds to personal loss and sexual politics in the divided landscapes her collection encompasses – Libya and the South Caucasus as well as Ukraine. An autobiographical section, Stories No-One Wants to Hear, returns to formative experiences of aggression in an English childhood. In a prose piece, the author recalls her father encouraging her to hit the school bullies, saying: “Anastasia, some people only understand one language.” The anecdote, which provides the collection with its title, continues: “My dad was the first person I punched, to stop him from hitting my mum.” The frankness, rejection of complacency and alertness to moral ambiguity power all the work in the collection and ensure it resonates as a personal as well as political act of witness. Taylor-Lind’s first book was Maidan – Portraits from the Black Square, a photographic record of her earlier visit to Ukraine depicting anti-government protestors and mourners. It was published by Gost in 2014.",Arts/Books,Poem of the week: Welcome to Donetsk by Anastasia Taylor-Lind,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2022/apr/25/poem-of-the-week-welcome-to-donetsk-by-anastasia-taylor-lind
4/25/2022,"This is probably going to shock a lot of people, but Angela Rayner has legs. What’s more, when she sits on the Labour frontbench in parliament, sometimes you can see them. Sometimes they might be crossed one way, sometimes the other. Imagine! It is, the Mail on Sunday panted, a bit like a “fully clothed” version of that bit in Basic Instinct where a knickerless Sharon Stone flashes detective Michael Douglas – except, of course, for all the many, many ways in which it’s nothing like that. But anyway, no wonder the poor, helplessly distracted prime minister barely knows what a Covid-busting party is, let alone whether he went to any. “She knows she can’t compete with Boris’s Oxford Union debating training, but she has other skills which he lacks,” leered the paper’s unsavoury source, perfectly illustrating the oldest misogynistic trope in the book: the idea that if women ever succeed, it can only have been by using their bodies. For how else could they possibly compete with the kind of towering male intellect that thinks it’s smart to portray their own leader as some kind of drooling lech, whose mind is anywhere but on the actual job? Boris Johnson dissociated himself from all this very swiftly, saying he deplored the “misogyny directed at [Rayner] anonymously today”. There’s even talk of disciplinary action against whichever backbencher is found to have planted it, although probably don’t hold your breath on that one. As Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon found out in 2017 when the Daily Mail reported their meeting (next to a picture of both women in – wait for it – skirts) with the headline “Never mind Brexit, who won Legs-it!”, even now, no woman in public life is so powerful that she can’t be instantly reduced to the sum of her body parts. What really enrages many women both in and out of Westminster, however, is that stories like this risk legitimising a locker-room culture still all too prevalent in politics that provides cover for more serious sexual predators. At the weekend, it was also reported that three cabinet ministers and two Labour shadow cabinet ministers have now been reported to the watchdog set up in the wake of the #MeToo scandal to investigate claims of sexual misconduct in parliament. So far, 56 MPs have reportedly been accused of anything from sexually inappropriate comments to alleged criminality, including an allegation that one MP “bribed a member of staff in return for sexual favours”. As ever with sexual harassment at work, it’s the young and the powerless and those who don’t dare complain if they want to get on that find themselves on the sharp end, as Rayner herself would be quick to acknowledge. A byelection in Wakefield is likely to be held later this year following the conviction of its sitting Tory MP, Imran Ahmad Khan, for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy, while the Conservative MP David Warburton still has the whip suspended over allegations of sexual harassment, which he denies. Crispin Blunt was forced to quit as chair of the all-party LGBT group after complaining that he thought Khan had been harshly treated, but he still has the Conservative whip, as do several backbenchers who provided support and character references for Charlie Elphicke, the former Dover MP who served a prison sentence for sexual assault. Labour has no reason to get complacent, either. It recently emerged that two former Labour staffers, Laura Murray and Georgie Robertson, were asked to sign gagging orders after complaining about the “inappropriate” behaviour of a senior official in March 2020. Both women have since left politics. It’s not just the fact that MPs are responsible for the laws governing everything from rape to equality at work that makes all this so shocking. Like doctors and priests, MPs are in constant contact with vulnerable people, at some of the most desperate moments in their lives. If you’re a woman needing their help on a sensitive issue, you may have no way of knowing when you walk into a constituency surgery whether yours is one of the 56 against whom allegations have been made – or even the sort who thinks a woman crossing her legs in the workplace constitutes, in 2022, some kind of juicy scandal. Times have thankfully changed at Westminster since I started out as a lobby reporter in the late 1990s. A new home secretary’s Commons debut probably wouldn’t be reported now, as Jacqui Smith’s was in 2007, with breathless comments about her cleavage (for the record, she was giving a statement on a failed terror attack at Glasgow airport) – and one reason the news seems suddenly full of political predators is that at least these days such stories are less likely to be brushed under the carpet. But a weakened prime minister who can’t afford to make any more backbench enemies may not be ideally placed to clean up parliament, and many female MPs on all sides still worry that – in the words of the Conservative chair of the equalities select committee, Caroline Nokes – the watchdog’s long-running investigation may not “deliver all that we would have wanted it to”. Let’s hope the backlash over the treatment of Rayner jolts a few more reluctant MPs into realising that the real risk comes not from washing their dirty linen in public, but from leaving it to fester until it stinks.

The article used an example from Sweden, but the seaweed industry is already growing at pace around our own shores. The Scottish Association for Marine Science in Oban, an independent marine research laboratory and part of the University of the Highlands and Islands, will help the industry grow with the launch of our Seaweed Academy on 26 April. The Seaweed Academy, the UK’s first dedicated seaweed industry facility, will use our research knowledge to offer advice to startups, train workers and help businesses develop. Seaweed farming has a low-carbon footprint, using no fresh water and with minimal land-based infrastructure. Indeed, we have been running trial seaweed farms for more than 10 years. Globally, the seaweed farming industry has been growing exponentially and is estimated to be worth around $15bn (£12bn) per year. As your article stated, the vast majority of this activity is in Asia. However, there is huge growth potential in Europe, with growing demand for seaweed from gourmet restaurants to livestock feeds.

4/25/2022,"Vladimir Putin has claimed his country’s FSB spy agency has foiled what he said was a western plan to kill a prominent Russian journalist. “This morning, the Federal Security Service stopped the activities of a terrorist group that planned to attack and kill one famous Russian TV journalist. … We have indisputable facts,” the Russian president said during a meeting with his country’s top prosecutors. “After experiencing an information fiasco in Russia, the west has now turned to attempts to kill Russian journalists,” Putin added, without providing evidence to support his claim. Shortly after Putin’s statements, the Russian news agency Tass said the security services had arrested Russian members of a neo-nazi group called National Socialism/White Power that was allegedly plotting to kill the popular pro-Kremlin state TV host Vladimir Solovyev on Ukraine’s orders. Tass said the security services seized a number of weapons as well as eight Molotov cocktails and six pistols during the arrest of the group. The FSB frequently claims to foil terror acts plotted by what it says are far-right groups acting on behalf of Ukraine, without providing much evidence to support their allegations. Days prior to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s security services also accused Kyiv of a number of attacks on Russian territory and the separatist-held Donbas, claims that were later debunked by independent journalists. Putin on Monday further said that the west was attempting to destroy Russia from the inside. “The task of splitting Russian society, destroying the country from the inside has come to the fore for the west, but their efforts will fail,” Putin said, adding that Russian society has “never been more united”. Putin also accused the west of using foreign media organisations and social media of to organise “provocations” against Russia’s armed forces.",News/World news,Putin claims FSB foiled western plot to kill pro-Kremlin journalist,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/putin-claims-fsb-foiled-western-plot-to-kill-pro-kremlin-journalist
4/25/2022,"It’s great to see Polly Toynbee’s article about our proposal for Energy for All, a free band of energy to cover basic needs (People are struggling to pay their energy bills – here’s a simple idea that could help, 21 April). As she says, this would reverse the present perverse situation where cutting down on energy leads you to pay more, not less, per unit. And it would provide some desperately needed security. The article helped take our petition to more than 350,000. Our proposal is that the core funding should come from ending the huge taxpayer subsidies now going to fossil fuel extractors, and a windfall tax on the obscene profits being made by extractors and suppliers. Raising prices so that people pay more for using more than they need would indeed be part of the mix, applied to profligate energy use: some people leave the heat on in their multi-bedroomed house while others freeze in a bedsit. With the rapid hoovering up and hoarding of wealth by the very rich, many can afford to pay more for their energy. But Fuel Poverty Action is not proposing indiscriminate price rises for everyone using more than just “enough to just about manage frugally in a small home”. While the details are yet to be worked out – by a public conversation involving more than just FPA – we are looking at energy audits that could take into account people’s real situation: age, disabilities, household size and the energy efficiency of the home. It is not only people on the lowest incomes who are struggling now. Eminently doable (much of this data is already gathered), audits would determine the amount of free energy to be allocated. It would also powerfully incentivise the government to insulate homes and back solar panels. And we should receive our free energy in kind, not in cash – a protection against speculators, profiteers and inflation.Ruth LondonFuel Poverty Action",Lifestyle/Money,Fuel Poverty Action’s energy pricing plan is not just for the poorest | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/25/fuel-poverty-actions-energy-pricing-plan-is-not-just-for-the-poorest
4/25/2022,"A US climate activist has died after he set himself on fire outside the US supreme court building in Washington. Wynn Bruce, from Boulder, Colorado, died on Saturday from his injuries, Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department said. Police said Bruce had set himself on fire at about 6.30pm on Friday, and was airlifted to hospital. A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan police told the Denver Post that investigators had not found a manifesto or note explaining Bruce’s motive. Friday was Earth Day, an annual global event to demonstrate support for environmental protection, and the supreme court has environmental cases on its docket. Bruce, 50, had recently edited a comment on his Facebook page, adding the date 22 April and a fire emoji. The comment was in response to a post about the global impact of climate change. Bruce had posted several times over the past year about the environment. On Sunday, Kritee Kanko, a Boulder-based climate scientist and Zen Buddhist priest, said Bruce was a friend and member of her Buddhist community, who had been planning the self-immolation for “at least one year”. “This act is not suicide. This is a deeply fearless act of compassion to bring attention to climate crisis,” Kanko said in a tweet. In a subsequent interview with the New York Times, Kanko said she could not be certain about Bruce’s intentions. She told the newspaper that “people are being driven to extreme amounts of climate grief and despair” and that “what I do not want to happen is that young people start thinking about self-immolation”. In April 2018 David Buckel, a prominent gay rights lawyer and environmental advocate, burned himself to death in New York. In a note, Buckel said: “Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result – my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.”",News/US news,US climate activist dies after setting himself on fire outside supreme court,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/25/climate-activist-death-supreme-court-fire-washington
