4/14/2022,"Environmental campaigners have caused rush-hour chaos in west London by clambering aboard an oil tanker and forcing the closure of a major roundabout leading to the start of the M4 motorway. “Road closures are currently in place at the Chiswick roundabout,” Hounslow police tweeted on Thursday morning. “Diversions are in place. Please avoid the area if possible.” Four activists were glued to the top of an Eddie Stobart fuel tanker at the junction, which feeds traffic from west London on and off the M4. Off the side of the articulated lorry they had draped flags reading: “Just Stop Oil.” Initially cars were able to pass the occupied tanker on lanes either side, with many drivers hurling abuse at the protesters. But as more police arrived they closed the roundabout. Activists from @JustStop_Oil have stopped an oil tanker at the Chiswick roundabout at the start of the M4 in west London pic.twitter.com/RlWTkayJMp The activists, who have been blockading fuel terminals since 1 April, causing petrol and diesel shortages in some areas, said they aimed to bring their protests to the public. “This is about making the invisible visible,” one shouted to the Guardian from atop the tanker. “It’s about showing people the stuff that is destroying people’s livelihoods and ecosystems.” In a statement, Just Stop Oil accepted responsibility for stopping the tanker and said its activists were working “to stop the flow of oil in London”. The group has vowed to disrupt oil deliveries in London until the government agrees a moratorium on all new oil and gas projects. The protest comes as reports of petrol and diesel shortages continued in areas targeted by Just Stop Oil. Over the past fortnight, the group has staged blockades and mass trespasses at 11 oil distribution facilities. On Wednesday it was reported that one major petrochemical company, the US-headquartered Valero oil, had obtained an injunction banning protests at its UK sites. Valero owns the Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire that has been repeatedly targeted by Just Stop Oil. The Labour party previously called for the government to impose “national injunctions” banning the group’s protests, leading to criticism after it was pointed out that that was not how injunctions work. In response, Just Stop Oil said Labour was “betraying its past, betraying the youth of this country, of every country and are complicit in climate genocide”.

They then stood in front of the cab, unfurled their banner and told the driver that others were climbing aboard his trailer.

4/14/2022,"The actor Thandiwe Newton has denied reports that she was fired from the new Magic Mike film after an argument over Will Smith with co-star Channing Tatum. Newton has said that she left the film after 11 days of shooting in London of her own volition. “Thandiwe Newton has made the difficult decision to step away from the production of Warner Bros Pictures’ Magic Mike’s Last Dance to deal with family matters,” a spokesperson said in a statement. Representatives for the actor called reports that she had been fired by Tatum, who is also a producer on the film, “completely inaccurate”. The report, which first surfaced in the Sun, suggested that Tatum and Newton had fallen out when discussing the incident at the Oscars last month in which Smith slapped Chris Rock on stage, following a joke that had been made about his wife’s alopecia. A source called the disagreement a “confrontation” and added that Tatum had said: “I am not working with her any more.” Salma Hayek will take over Newton’s role. Magic Mike’s Last Dance sees a return for Tatum to the role of male stripper Mike Lane, as well as a return to the franchise for the original’s director, Steven Soderbergh, who exited for the second film. The two films have made over $300m at the global box office. A lucrative stage spin-off, Magic Mike Live, has had shows in Las Vegas, London, Berlin and Australia. Speaking to People magazine, Tatum expressed the hope the new film would be like “the Super Bowl of stripping”, with a much higher quality of routines than previously seen. He also described the films as “very, very female-forward” and stressed the importance for him of a strong female lead. “I want to have an equal, if not even more centralised female character for Mike to really play off of and almost to … I don’t want to say, [to have her] take the baton, but really let the movie be about a female’s experience and not Mike’s experience, because it has been so much about Mike and the guys’ experiences.” Newton is currently starring opposite Chris Pine in Amazon hit All the Old Knives.",Arts/Film,Thandiwe Newton denies being fired from Magic Mike due to row with Channing Tatum over Will Smith,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/14/thandiwe-newton-denies-being-fired-from-magic-mike-due-to-bust-up-with-channing-tatum
4/14/2022,"On a cold winter night, three armed men disguised as police officers arrived at a suburban home in a small Canadian resort town and knocked on the door, claiming that they had an arrest warrant for a 37-year-old woman who was staying there. After overpowering the homeowner, they seized the woman, Iranian-born Elnaz Hajtamiri, hauled her barefoot through the snow into a vehicle, and sped off into the dark. Nearly three months later, police admit they are no closer to locating Hajtamiri, in a case that has baffled investigators. “I have never, never come across a case like this,” Ontario provincial police detective inspector Martin Graham told reporters this week, adding that investigators had not determined a motive or received any ransom demands. They also have not located the white Lexus SUV vehicle used in the abduction on 12 January, nor have they identified its owner. “My biggest hope is that Elnaz is alive,” said Graham. “My greatest fear is that she is not.” Police took the “extraordinary” step of reaching out to the Iranian community in Toronto and Montreal as they expand the scope of their search, and are contemplating the possibility that she has been taken out of the country. This week, investigators also said they believed a brutal assault on Hajtamiri in December was linked to her abduction. Two weeks before the kidnapping, Hajtamiri was attacked in the parking garage of her condo in Richmond Hill, a city north of Toronto. The assailants beat her with a frying pan and left her with serious head wounds that required 40 stitches. Police say they later retrieved a tracking device. Two other tracking devices were found in her car when she brought the vehicle in for servicing in November. After the December attack, Hajtamiri feared for her safety and moved in with family in the town of Wasaga Beach, 145km (90 miles) north of Toronto. The only time she reportedly left the beachfront community was 10 January, to retrieve her vehicle, computer and mobile phone from police. Two days later, she was abducted. No arrests have been made in the parking garage assault, but police say they do not believe the same men were involved. “We have at least five different people responsible directly for these crimes,” said Graham. “Despite the number of people involved, we have received no information that would provide us with a definite link as to where the investigation should be headed.” In late January, police arrested her former boyfriend Mohamad Lilo, charging him with criminal harassment. The two broke up in October, but he tried to contact her the next month and police become involved. Officers would not say if he is a suspect in her abduction, but said they are investigating the relationship, which they said was both personal and professional. Hajtamiri, who also goes by the surname Tamiri, emigrated to Canada less than four years ago, after she lost her husband. She had recently started her own cake-making company after leaving an import-export business. In their latest push for new information, police released a video of Fariba Hajtamiri, Elnaz’s mother, pleading for her daughter’s release. Fariba, who still lives in Iran, said the family’s life has become “desperate” as they hope for Elnaz’s release. “We desperately need your help,” she said in Farsi. “I beg you as a mother to guide us and tell us anything you know. Please, I beg of you.”",News/Weather,Case of Iranian-born woman abducted by fake officers baffles Canadian police,https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2022/apr/14/iranian-born-woman-fake-officers-elnaz-hajtamiri-canadian-police
4/14/2022,"The UK’s largest sandbank has been protected from bottom trawling, an environmentally destructive fishing technique. Activists have been calling on the government for years to stop bottom trawling at Dogger Bank, an important site off the east coast of England for species including sand eels, hermit crabs, flatfish and starfish. Recent data showed the fishing method, involving weighted nets being dragged across the seabed, had tripled in occurrence in the marine protected area (MPA) since Brexit. This is despite the area being labelled an MPA. Bottom trawling happens in many of these environmentally significant areas, leading campaigners and experts to refer to them as nothing but “paper parks”. Not only does it disturb species living on the seabed, it is also a significant source of carbon release, as the seabed normally acts as a valuable sink to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, but turns into a carbon source when disturbed. Now, the method will be banned, with government sources referring to the new legislation as a result of “Brexit freedoms”. The four bylaws, being introduced using new powers under the 2020 Fisheries Act, will come into effect in June. The environment secretary, George Eustice, said: “Outside the EU, we are using our new freedoms to protect our marine environment. We will be stopping trawling and dredging in these marine protected areas to protect wildlife and habitats, through powers we have in our Fisheries Act 2020.” As well as Dogger Bank, there are three other MPAs being saved from the fishing technique. These are Inner Dowsing, Race Bank and North Ridge special area of conservation, , which lies off the south Lincolnshire coast, the South Dorset marine conservation zone and the Canyons marine conservation zone, which is in the far south-west corner of the UK’s continental shelf area. However, experts have pointed out there are 64 MPAs, most of which have few protections from destructive fishing. Melissa Moore, the head of UK policy at the NGO Oceana, said: “It’s good news that government has at last taken the first step to manage four of its 64 offshore benthic MPAs, given that damaging activity such as bottom trawling is prohibited in MPAs under conservation law. “We fully support the Dogger Bank bylaw that will protect the whole site and have benefits for the North Sea ecosystem beyond. However, the bylaw proposed for Inner Dowsing MPA is tiny and will only protect parts of the site. We call on UK to remedy this and with devolved governments to act quickly to ban bottom-towed gear in the remaining 60 offshore MPAs that they promised to manage following Oceana’s legal challenge in 2021. This is now increasingly urgent due to the climate and ecological crises.” Greenpeace has been campaigning for the government to stop trawling at Dogger Bank, most notably dropping rocks in the MPA to thwart trawlers. Campaigners have asked the government to use its post-Brexit powers to go further and ban destructive fishing practices in all MPAs. Fiona Nicholls, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “It’s been 18 months since Greenpeace built a protective boulder barrier in the Dogger Bank and since the government committed to stop bottom trawling in this iconic and ecologically important area. While this is a major step towards protecting some of the most environmentally significant features of the Dogger Bank, destructive industrial fishing vessels like factory trawlers will still be allowed to plunder this now partially protected area. “We need the government to get us on track this year to fully or highly protecting all of our marine protected areas. That means, as a starting point, banning all destructive industrial fishing vessels. This could be done using post-Brexit powers to restrict fishing licences, rather than simply relying on the cumbersome process of introducing partial site bylaw restrictions. Only then will the UK be a true world leader in marine protection, and can nature and coastal communities have a chance to recover.”",News/Environment,UK’s largest sandbank given protection from bottom trawling,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/14/uk-largest-sandbank-dogger-bank-protection-bottom-trawling
4/14/2022,"In a gray sharkskin suit and aviator sunglasses, Pastor Christopher Benek stands on a patch of astroturf at the edge of the First Miami Presbyterian church parking lot. “Here’s the thing,” he says. “Right now this is a parking lot.” A developer has a plan to make it much more than that, and Benek is buying in. Benek was hired in 2018 as a “crisis-management specialist” to lead First Miami Presbyterian, the oldest congregation in the city, away from what seemed like impending ruin. The church has been a fixture in the community since 1896, peaking in membership at about 1,400 in the late 1980s before dwindling to 140 in the early aughts and continuing to decline. “They’ve been a financial wreck for years,” Benek says. “Those problems don’t get solved overnight.” With the church facing over $7m in back taxes, Benek has negotiated a potential deal to sell 2.2 acres of its 3.4 acre lot to a local developer for $240m. (Just four years ago, it was valued at $66m – a symptom of the rental market’s blistering recent inflation.) This last slice of undeveloped waterfront property in downtown Miami’s financial district has been coveted by developers for years. For the last two decades, religious affiliation in the US has continued to decline. Membership of denominations of Christianity – the country’s dominant religion – fell from 78% in 2007 to 63% in 2021, while the number of Americans with no religious affiliation – dubbed “nones” – has risen from 16% to 29% over the same timeframe. With large physical footprints, but precious few congregants, many traditional churches have faced difficult decisions about their viability, opting to downsize or close their doors altogether. But in Florida – particularly Miami, which has a severe housing shortage and was recently named the most expensive city for home ownership in America – developers are capitalizing by constructing multi-unit apartment buildings any place possible, giving church leadership there another option: selling to the highest bidder. As part of First Miami’s deal, the church would keep its sanctuary, but lose its school, office space and sun-scarred parking lot. It would get, Benek points out, 20,000 square feet of additional worship space just beneath a lavish pool deck on the 11th floor of the bay-front 80-story luxury condo tower the developer plans to build. After a recent Sunday service, a longtime church member, Cary Tolley, stood eyeing the building – its cherry-wood interior and handsomely oxidized tin roof mark a lull in the cold procession of modernist skyscrapers lining Biscayne Boulevard. “If this real estate transaction goes through, it won’t be long before the church closes its doors,” he says. As the voice of the opposition, Tolley has stuck his neck out to condemn the deal. Benek is undeterred. “There’s been no critique about the actual build, which tells me that all the opposition is only about politics and control,” he says. Walking towards the Biscayne Bay on the far side of the parking lot, Benek grows animated as he approaches a row of food trucks, where a few dozen young people sit on picnic tables beneath monitors playing promos for bible study. This was part of Benek’s initiative to put a modern gloss on some of the church’s assets. “Every day of the week, tons of people come here,” he says. “It’s pretty amazing.” The hope that it will attract some new faces to Bible study and that trucks will pay to rent a spot are increasingly common money-making tactics for churches in the state. But, in First Miami’s case, it’s not nearly enough to cover seven-figure debts. The more Benek talks, the easier it is to understand why some of the older members of the congregation find him off-putting. He overuses the verbs “leveraging” and “scaling” and name-checks Elon Musk as he compares technology to theology; during the pandemic, Benek launched a VR church service set in a virtual model of First Miami. Older congregants found it disagreeable and a waste of money. One of the main criticisms about the proposed deal – to which the Presbytery of Tropical Florida, a council that oversees the business dealings of all Presbyterian churches in the region, agreed – is that Benek held the deliberations and final voting over video chat, which the same demographic had a challenging time with. “Is the spirit of God not so big that it can’t work through Zoom?” Benek asks. He is unapologetic about his predictions for the future of the American church. In short, he says it could be extinct by the year 2030. “Churches can’t survive on passing the plate alone,” he says, referring to collecting tithes. “This isn’t the 1960s.” More and more churches are employing entrepreneurial business models to remain profitable in Florida’s rapidly growing metropolitan areas. In downtown Miami alone, four historic churches have sold in the last three years with condo high-rises going up in their place. Others are selling their air rights or are renting out unused interior space and parking lots. In February, a Lutheran church in a suburb of Miami agreed to share its property with a Wawa gas station and move into a smaller building behind the site’s convenience store. “Most of these churches are just trying to figure out a way to survive,” says Matt Messier, a Florida-based real estate broker who specializes in religious and non-profit properties. “When the property values go up, it gives them a lot more options.” Other than the federal government, religious organizations are the largest owners of real estate in the country, but in the near future we will undoubtedly see fewer spires and steeples. Messier says churches will embrace a more secular appearance, moving into existing community centers and fellowshipping in gyms, coffee shops – or, in the case of First Miami Presbyterian, the 11th floor of a luxury condominium. Pastor Audrey Warren provides a window into the future of First Miami Presbyterian church. In 2018, three years into her tenure as pastor of the nearby First United Methodist, she helped arrange the sale of her church’s original 1.15-acre property, just one mile north of First Miami, for $55m. Before the sale, 50% of its income came from renting out parking spaces to a community college. When its 40-year building inspection came up in 2016, the church estimated that the necessary renovations would have cost more than $500,000, which it couldn’t afford. “We were counting toilet paper rolls,” she said. Warren and church leadership vetted a parade of brokers and developers before finding the right fit. The new development project was christened Society Biscayne, a 49-story mixed-use apartment building, and the original church was promptly demolished. Once the build is complete, the 125-year-old congregation of First United Methodist will find its new home somewhere between the sky pool deck, co-working lab, yoga lawn and two-story gym. “We would never have survived on tithing alone,” she says. “There’s been a very steady decline since the 1970s.” And it will soon get worse. The “death tsunami of the church”, as Warren calls it, is expected to reach its apex within the next 10 to 20 years, as the death rate of Baby Boomers increases, according to US Census Bureau data. “These are the people who give a full tithe, but also our volunteers, teachers and elders,” she says. “We’re going to lose these people soon.” On the third Sunday of March, in the year of our Lord 2022, the airy corridors of First Miami Presbyterian church are filled with music but not people. This is only the second in-person service since the church has reopened after two years of virtual service due to the pandemic. Behind the altar, the lead singer of a praise band pounds away on his piano keys and looks out into the sparse crowd. The pews are about 15% full. “C’mon!” he says, inviting them to sing along. “Let’s knock the dust off these pews!” Preaching a reformist and relatively progressive strain of Christianity, First Miami’s Presbyterianism is one of the seven mainline denominations in America. The US constitution was inspired by Presbyterian governance, better known as “ecclesiastical polity”. As a cultural touchpoint for centuries, it’s the kind of church that would be with you for your baptism, wedding and funeral. The smattering of young families and seniors in the pews straddle these life events, but most people in this part of town – dotted with celebrity-chef steakhouses and multi-story nightclubs – are still partying from the previous night instead of attending to their souls. As Benek steps up to the stage to deliver his sermon, Cary Tolley sits near the back of the church, lean with a shiny bald head and white beard. His central complaint about the deal Benek is overseeing is that there’s no formal agreement about how the money will be used. “We’re completely reliant on the good faith of the presbytery that they’ll let the church use the money,” he says. Though the congregation voted in favor of selling last October, Tolley says that the vote should be thrown out on a technicality. Presbyterian churches have a representative form of government, “but the members have been largely shut out of this process … this is totally contrary to how a healthy church operates”. Following the vote, Tolley filed a remedial complaint with a higher court (the Presbyterian church has an especially complicated judicial system) and succeeded in delaying the sale. As he explains the forthcoming legal proceedings in great detail, a fellow churchgoer approaches Tolley and leans in to whisper in his ear. “Did you hear that?” he asks. “That person just told me, ‘You’re doing a good thing; keep it up.’” Not all houses of worship in Miami are struggling. Vous Church (short for rendezvous), run by a fourth-generation evangelical pastor to the stars, Rich Wilkerson Jr, attracts thousands of people to multiple campuses throughout south Florida every Sunday. “I don’t see us in competition with a place like Vous,” Benek says of the church whose pastor officiated Kanye West and Kim Kardashian’s wedding. “It’s easy to draw a crowd when you have Kanye West perform Sunday Service, but there’s victory and peril in that.” Benek suggests that eventually the magnetism of contemporary megachurches with charismatic pastors fades. “It’s all young people [at Vous]. What we want is intergenerational.” The mission of churches writ large, as Benek sees it, is to reduce suffering in the world, but that’s impossible if they can’t figure out a way to keep the lights on. If this sale goes through, the windfall of cash would get kicked back to the Presbytery of Tropical Florida, but he says the larger portion will be used to fund homelessness programs, staffing, Bible studies and, of course, the VR offering. All of which, he says, will help grow their membership. No matter how many churches close, or how few congregants remain after the current trend bottoms out, Benek is confident that the core tenets of Christianity will never fall apart. “Look at where we are,” he says, glancing up at the glass towers neighboring his church, which radiate the kind of disquieting emptiness characteristic of trendy new development projects. “The people who live in Brickell have more money than most Americans could ever dream of, but money will never answer their existential questions,” he says. Lolling back to eye level, he affects a solemn expression. “After all, the enemy of humanity is death. Unless that changes, the pursuit of spirituality will never end.”",News/World news,‘Death tsunami of the church’: Florida pastors seek salvation in real estate,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/miami-church-real-estate-first-presbyterian

4/14/2022,"More than two years since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, nearly a quarter of incarcerated people awaiting their day in court in San Francisco county are being held beyond their original trial deadlines, with some individuals waiting for years for their cases to be heard. In June 2020, in the early months of the pandemic, 68 people were incarcerated in the county past their original trial deadlines, according to data from the public defender. By January 2022, the latest data available, that number had grown to nearly 250. Hundreds more are awaiting trial out of custody. California state law stipulates that those accused of crimes are entitled to a speedy trial – 30 to 60 days following their arraignment, depending on the nature of the crime. But backlogs in the court system, made worse by the pandemic, have obliterated those deadlines, often at significant cost to the mental health and wellbeing of those imprisoned, and their loved ones. The problem in the county became so severe that Mano Raju, the San Francisco public defender, filed a lawsuit in September 2021 alleging the city’s superior court is violating people’s constitutional right to a speedy trial. “These aren’t even people who have been convicted of a crime,” Raju said. “They’re just awaiting their day in court.” This disproportionately affects communities of color. Though Black residents comprise 6% of San Francisco’s total population, they make up about 45% of the county jail population. “Our clients are largely poor and from communities of color, so when their rights are trampled there isn’t always the outcry there would be if this was happening to people from another community,” said Raju. Robert Brewer said the long wait showed the criminal justice system’s unfairness. It has taken a toll on his health and put his life on hold. “You’re supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, but you’re treated as if you’ve already been sentenced,” he said. Brewer was found not guilty of a homicide charge in May 2021 following a trial, after being held for more than five months past his original trial date. But since his release, the experience of incarceration has continued to affect his mental health. “Being released is not as joyful as you might expect,” Brewer said. “You come out of this hole with very little human contact. You make it out, but you leave a big piece of yourself in jail.” In his lawsuit, Raju points to the lingering effects of case backlogs on individuals’ mental health and the county jail’s treatment of incarcerated people during Covid-19 lockdowns to argue the court should do more to address the backlogs. Some people who have been incarcerated told the Guardian they were allowed out of their cells for less than an hour a day during outbreaks of the virus. Brewer said he was only allowed to shower every two to three days before returning to his cell, after a cellmate contracted Covid. Solitary confinement and social isolation have been strongly linked to negative impacts on mental health, including a heightened risk of suicide. The San Francisco sheriff’s department, which manages the jail, said it followed practices recommended by health officials in keeping custody officers and jail residents safe. The department acknowledged incarcerated people were sometimes held in their cells for upwards of 23 hours a day, citing a variety of reasons such as “social distancing protocols, quarantine protocols, isolation protocols, disciplinary action, administrative segregation, and staffing shortages”. Raju said: “Solitary-like conditions mean you can’t leave a cell, often one where you can reach out your arms and touch the walls, for more than one hour per day. This can have a strong psychological impact.” Kwixuan Maloof, a San Francisco deputy public defender, says that a trial deadline can serve as a source of stability and encourages people to resist the temptation to accept a plea bargain, which often involves pleading guilty and avoiding a trial in exchange for the possibility of more lenient sentencing or a charge being downgraded. But without that guarantee, the pressure to accept a bargain goes up, even for those who believe they have a strong chance of being exonerated in court. “It’s very frustrating for me, and ten times more so for my clients, when they ask me when their trial is going to start and all I can say is ‘I don’t know,’” said Maloof. “In those circumstances, it becomes very easy to say: ‘You know what, I’m done. I’m going to take whatever deal they offer me.’” Prior to the pandemic, court backlogs were far from unheard of in the US. But an August 2021 study by the Thomson Reuters Institute found that the pandemic had substantially increased such backlogs nationwide, as trials were indefinitely delayed during surges of the virus and courts struggled to adapt to virtual operations. According to the judicial council of California, the clearance rate for criminal trials statewide has dropped by around 20% during the pandemic. As restrictions start to ease, success at alleviating the backlogs has been mixed as different municipalities experiment with varying approaches. Matt Malone, a public information officer with the Contra Costa county superior court, said that through a number of initiatives, the court had brought its case backlog from 104 in March 2021 to 51 in March 2022. If not for the suspension of jury trials during the Omicron surge, Malone notes, the backlog would probably have been even lower. Malone added the county had taken steps to adapt to social distancing requirements, such as making sure remote capabilities were “tremendously expanded”, staggering jury calls, and installing air filtration systems in courtrooms. Rose Marie Sims, a plaintiff in the legal action filed by Raju against the San Francisco superior court, said her son Christopher had been incarcerated for over two years and still had not received a trial. “I can’t believe this is America. I love this country, but the judicial system seems to have lost its mind,” said Sims. “How do you keep someone locked up like that without giving them their trial? Every time I talk with my son on the phone, I can hear the light leaving him.” Sims said her son had lost his fiancee and job and would need to start over. “He’s lost everything,” she said. “It’s traumatizing as a parent.” The public defender’s office, as well as the San Francisco district attorney, have called on the San Francisco superior court to make more rooms available for criminal trials in the civic center courthouse. In February of this year, Raju filed a petition in the California courts of appeal asking that the San Francisco court be forced to take steps to prioritize criminal trials. The Contra Costa county superior court, where Raju filed his original lawsuit in September, had concluded it did not have authority over the San Francisco superior court. A spokesperson for San Francisco superior court said the court was committed to justice and “processing all cases as expeditiously as possible under the difficult circumstances presented by the pandemic.” But Raju disagrees and said more needed to be done to process cases swiftly. “How long it will take to address the backlog depends on what the court is willing to do,” he said. “There is a lack of urgency.”  In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is at 800-273-8255 and online chat is also available.

It has displays of local and regional archaeology from fossils and prehistory to the Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and the Monmouth Rebellion (the castle was used for the Bloody Assizes). Great for adults and children alike. One gallery hosts temporary exhibitions (currently on Coleridge, who lived and wrote in Somerset) and there is a lovely cafe, shop and a very pretty courtyard.Lucy A large fire-breathing dragon burst through the wall beneath Cobb Hall, once the site of public executions. It’s a strange welcome for visitors to Lincoln Castle. Within the castle walls, the intact Victorian prison with its unique chapel offers a glimpse into Lincolnshire’s criminal past, while the modern Magna Carta Vault displays the original 1215 document and links history to present day. A stroll around the medieval battlements provides spectacular views of Lincoln Cathedral, the city and surrounding countryside. Free guided tours recount the castle’s 1,000 years of history. The informative and entertaining staff will regale you with tales of dark deeds, pardons, escapes and much more. Admission £15/£8.30.Sue Bell You can hardly walk around a bend in Wales without tripping over a castle. But as you drive around a bend on the A496, the view of Edward I’s Harlech Castle atop a rocky outcrop is particularly magnificent. It’s not a huge castle but there’s still plenty to see. It’s very well maintained and the views from the top are exceptional. There’s a small pay-and-display a short walk from the entrance, but don’t get caught out by turning down the “world’s steepest street” next to it (Ffordd Pen Llech at 37.45% took the title from a road in Dunedin, New Zealand in 2019). The castle has a small cafe, or there are options in the village. Admission £8.30/£5.80.Sarah Malcolm Arrive early for stunning 18th-century Culzean Castle, on top of a cliff on Scotland’s west coast. The castle interior wows from the start, with a huge display of flintlock pistols in the entrance hall, continuing with an elegant Robert Adam staircase and reception rooms, including President Dwight Eisenhower’s apartment. Clamber down to the beach to explore rock pools for urchins and starfish, or spot waterfowl at the swan pond. Visit the lovingly tended walled gardens and orangery, or wander the 260 hectares of country park, with llamas and red deer. Kids will love the Adventure Cove and Wild Woodland play parks. Home Farm kitchen provides good food, but there are also picnic areas. With so much to explore the admission price of £18.50/£10.50 is good value.Berni G We absolutely loved our day trip to Rochester Castle, an impressive early-12th-century structure on the banks of the River Medway, which has survived no fewer than three sieges during the 13th century, and in 1381 was ransacked during the Peasants’ Revolt. We roamed the ruins and explored the passageways for a few hours and got a real feel of what the castle would have been like when it was inhabited. The views of the historic city from the top were stunning. After our visit, we enjoyed a picnic on the lawn and then explored the neighbouring cathedral. It’s an English Heritage site, costing £7.40 adult, £3.20 child.Jay Gee A two-in-one treat, Ogmore Castle and Candleston Castle, both free-to-visit ruins, stand on opposite sides of the River Ogmore in south Wales between Bridgend and Porthcawl, about 600 metres from each other. Stepping stones link the banks of the broad stream. Ogmore is thought to have been built at the beginning of the 12th century, while its 14th-century neighbour, Candleston, stands on the edge of the Merthyr Mawr nature reserve and its sand dunes – some of the highest in the UK. When you’ve had your fill of castles and sand, snag a waterside table at Hilary and Iain by Sea for fish and chips with a view of the endless sea traffic on the Bristol Channel.Jayne Lydford Castle, built in the 13th century on the western edge of Dartmoor, has been a destination for picnics, nature walks, peaceful sunbathing and treasure hunts for four generations of my family. Its spacious grounds and quiet, unspoilt location in a pretty village make it a rare gem. However, its history is not all sweetness and light, as the tower was used as a prison. One of its most famous inmates was Richard Strode, MP for Plymouth, a tinner jailed in 1510 after complaining that mining debris in the moorland rivers was silting up the harbour at Plymouth. He described the castle as “one of the most annoious, contagious and detestable places wythin this realme”. Visiting it is free, as is the parking.Claire Late 11th-century Skipton Castle, survivor of a three-year siege during the English Civil War (it was occupied by royalists) is a superb place to visit. The guides are knowledgable and entertaining and the dungeons particularly terrifying. The kids can follow a picture trail and spot interesting things. Rather more pleasant were the buns and cake in the cafe. And the grounds and ancient woodland of Skipton Castle Woods are great for a burst of fresh air after your visit. Often you’ll find archers demonstrating their talents there. Entry is £10.20 adult £6.90 child.

4/14/2022,"“What is it about ambiguity,” asked Tim Parks in 2015, “that it has to be praised to high heaven by all and sundry? Above all, how did it come to take on, at least for some, a cloak of liberal righteousness?” Reading Julian Barnes’s new novel, the question feels especially apposite. This is a work that both uses and abuses ambiguity. In doing so, it undermines itself. Elizabeth Finch, the novel’s eponymous subject, teaches an adult education course in culture and civilisation. The narration comprises the recollections of Neil, her former student and would-be hagiographer. Her class, he tells us, “shook my mind around, made me constantly rethink, burst stars inside my head”. Students were awestruck by “the shimmer of her phrasing, the lustre of her brain”. Under her tutelage they “actually began, in real time, to think for ourselves”. There’s a sense of daring in depicting the impact of an inspirational teacher. If Finch and her teaching fall short, our faith in the novel will falter. Early on, we sense Barnes’s hesitancy. Straining to burnish Finch’s aura, he deploys, then redeploys, a reliable novelistic cliche – charisma through immobility. In the first paragraph, Finch is “still”. By page six she’s “preternaturally still”. “She commanded attention,” says Neil, spelling it out, “by her stillness.” So Finch doesn’t move much. But that’s just the start of what she doesn’t do. Finch, we’re told, “didn’t smoke like anyone else”. “She had none of those lecturer’s tics and tricks designed to charm, distract, or indicate character. She never waved her arms about or supported her chin in her hand.” She was “not in any way a public figure”. She “wasn’t interested in football or celebrity chefs or the ever-changing dictates of fashion, or box sets or gossip”, but “she wasn’t in any way a snob” either. Sounds a bit mysterious, doesn’t she? But no: she “had no ‘mysteriousness’ about her” either. This is ambiguity not as subtlety, but avoidance: Finch simply isn’t there. Hoping to make a virtue of her absence, Barnes lays down a fog of negation. But this only deepens the problem. The reader feels distanced from Finch; the novel feels distanced from its subject. Finch’s impact, then, must come from the work to which the novel forms a tribute: her teaching. According to Neil, she “directed us elegantly away from the obvious”. A quick scan of her aphoristic wisdom, however, suggests that she did so exclusively by stating the obvious. Acting is “the perfect example of artificiality producing authenticity”. “Failure can tell us more than success.” “Insults most often occur when an argument is being lost.” Voting is a “civic duty”. Anarchism has a certain intellectual appeal but “realistically, it would never work”. And love, would you believe, is “all there is … the only thing that matters”. “If she taught us one thing,” says Neil, further diluting the thin gruel of Finch’s thought, “it was that history is for the long haul.” Finch’s studiously bien-pensant truisms, coupled with Barnes’s via negativa characterisation, leave the novel in search of a centre. Barnes, it seems, senses this: 44 pages in, he cuts his losses and kills Finch off – a move which, tellingly, brings the novel to life. Bequeathed Finch’s journals, Neil becomes a historian of his history teacher. The fragmentary, elusive portrait of Finch that emerges feels far more intimate and interesting than the one glimpsed through Neil’s coursing admiration. Freed from the narrative responsibility of investing Finch with energy, meanwhile, Neil softens, expands, and becomes a fuller figure in his own right. Barnes is in his element here – investigating with subtlety and gentleness the quiet mysteries that make up a life. So it’s all the more mystifying and disappointing that, just as the novel Elizabeth Finch could have been moves tantalisingly into view, Barnes self-sabotages, devoting the book’s entire middle section to Neil’s stolid student essay on Julian the Apostate, the “Roman emperor who never set foot in Rome”, known for his “persecution by methods of mildness”. As Neil labours away at one of the novel’s many undercooked and unintegrated ideas – the shortcomings of monotheism – the narrative flounders, never to recover. In Barnes’s tripartite structure, each new section must compensate for the shortcomings of the last. With a motionless middle on his hands, Barnes works in the final third to recover some sense of momentum. In his search for compelling incident, though, he finds only implausibility. Returning to Neil’s recollections, we learn of Finch’s public “shaming”. Invited by the London Review of Books to give a small public lecture, Finch (who, let us recall, was “not in any way a public figure”) finds that her historical perspective on monotheism has, ludicrously, become the subject of a furious national outcry. It’s here that we’re reminded of Parks’ “cloak of liberal righteousness”. Barnes has depended too heavily on ambiguity as a substitute for clarity. Consequently, Finch and her ideas lack force. In order to bring about her cancellation, therefore, Barnes must distort the world in which those ideas are received. The result is neither a critique of a reactionary culture nor a defence of nuance and free thought. Instead, it’s a bourgeois intellectual fantasy – an England where the LRB is seriously regarded by its detractors as “a nest of leftists, subversives, pseudo-intellectuals, cosmopolitans, traitors, liars and anti-monarchist vermin”; where perfectly bland ideas are magically imbued with the power to unsettle; and where a talk in a bookshop gets you doorstepped by the red-tops. Finally, Barnes returns to the ambiguity with which we began. Perhaps Neil’s memory and impressions can’t be trusted. Perhaps no memory can be trusted. Perhaps history, as a result, is nothing but interpretation and speculation. Coming as the conclusion to a novel that had begun on firmer ground, this loosening of certainty could have passed for daring subversion. Here, though, it feels like just another evasion – vagueness layered on to vagueness. Elizabeth Finch is a work stubbornly determined to deny us its pleasures, even as it hints at what they could have been.  Sam Byers’ latest novel is Come Join Our Disease (Faber).

4/14/2022,"The London-listed mining company Petropavlovsk has warned investors they may be wiped out though a potential sale, as it struggles to regain its footing after UK sanctions against a key Russian client. The miner said it was facing financial pressures due to UK government restrictions on Gazprombank, which is one of Petropavlovsk’s main customers and buys all of its gold. Gazprombank, which processes most payments for the Russian oil and gas sector, has been subject to UK sanctions since 24 March. Petropavlovsk said it had appointed the restructuring expert AlixPartners to aid the board “as it explores its options and determines the company’s course of action in the best interest of all stakeholders, including creditors and shareholders”. “These options include the sale of the company’s entire interests in its operating subsidiaries as soon as practically possible. It is not currently clear what return, if any, may be secured for shareholders or the holders of the bonds or notes as a result of this process,” it warned. Last month, the Russian billionaire Sergey Sudarikov, who part-owns the sanction-hit Credit Bank of Moscow, bought a 29% stake in Petropavlovsk from its biggest shareholder, Konstantin Strukov, who owns the Russian gold miner UGC. Petropavlovsk was founded as Peter Hambro Mining in 1994 but its eponymous founder was ousted in 2017 after a boardroom coup. The FTSE 250 company said it was exploring whether it could sell gold to other buyers, though that would require Gazprombank to grant a waiver on existing contracts. However, it noted that Russia’s central bank has set gold purchase prices below London rates, which could impact its cashflows, assuming another Russian firm were to commit to purchasing its precious metals. Petropavlovsk has also run into trouble on its loans, since it is barred from making payments to Gazprombank. The miner has a $200m (£152m) loan from the lender, including a $86.7m revolving credit facility, but was barred from paying a $560,000 interest payment last month after the lender was put on the UK sanctions list. Russia is rumoured to be preparing laws that would make it a criminal offence for companies to refuse to deal with local companies because of foreign sanctions. “If such legislation is enacted, the board may not be able to ensure that its subsidiaries will comply with the regulations in Russia,” Petropavlovsk said.",News/Business,"Petropavlovsk investors could be wiped out by sale, warns mining firm ",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/14/petropavlovsk-investors-could-be-wiped-out-by-sale-warns-mining-firm
