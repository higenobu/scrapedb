3/9/2022,"Enrique Tarrio, a leader of the Proud Boys far-right group, has been arrested and charged with conspiracy over the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. In a statement on Tuesday, the US Department of Justice said: “Tarrio, 38, of Miami, Florida, was arrested in Miami and is to make his initial appearance today in the southern district of Florida.” Tarrio faces counts of conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and obstruction of an official proceeding, and two counts each of assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers and destruction of government property. Four other individuals have been charged: Ethan Nordean, 31, of Auburn, Washington; Joseph Biggs, 38, of Ormond Beach, Florida; Zachary Rehl, 36, of Philadelphia; Charles Donohoe, 34, of Kernersville, North Carolina; and Dominic Pezzola, 44, of Rochester, New York. “They earlier pleaded not guilty to charges,” the DoJ said, referring to an indictment in December. News of charges against Tarrio followed charges of seditious conspiracy against 11 members of another far-right group, the Oath Keepers militia, which were announced in January. Tarrio and the Proud Boys rose to prominence in support of Donald Trump and through violent confrontations with leftwing protesters. On 6 January 2021, Trump supporters gathered in Washington DC to protest against Trump’s election defeat by Joe Biden. Trump told them to “fight like hell” in service of his lie about electoral fraud. The Capitol was attacked. Seven people died around the riot and more than 100 police officers were hurt. More than 770 people have been charged. The first jury trial arising from the attack, involving a Texas man who was a member of the Three Percenters rightwing group, reached jury deliberations on Tuesday. Tarrio was not in Washington on 6 January 2021, having been arrested for vandalising a Black church and for carrying two high-capacity rifle magazines. But the DoJ said: “From in or around December 2020, Tarrio and his co-defendants, all of whom were leaders or members of the Ministry of Self Defense [a Proud Boys group] conspired to corruptly obstruct, influence, and impede an official proceeding, the certification of the electoral college vote. “On 6 January, the defendants directed, mobilised, and led members of the crowd on to the Capitol grounds and into the Capitol, leading to dismantling of metal barricades, destruction of property, and assaults on law enforcement. “Although Tarrio is not accused of physically taking part in the breach of the Capitol, the indictment alleges that he led the advance planning and remained in contact with other members of the Proud Boys during their breach of the Capitol. “The indictment alleges that Tarrio nonetheless continued to direct and encourage the Proud Boys prior to and during the events of 6 January 2021, and that he claimed credit for what had happened on social media and in an encrypted chat room during and after the attack.” In August last year, Tarrio was sentenced to five months in prison. He has also been revealed to have previously been an FBI informant. Tarrio has denied organising violence on 6 January. The Times said a lawyer for Tarrio declined comment, as he was waiting to see the indictment.",News/US news,Proud Boys leader arrested on US Capitol attack conspiracy charge,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/enrique-tarrio-proud-boys-leader-arrested-us-capitol-attack-conspiracy
3/9/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has promised to scrap the French television licence fee if he is re-elected president next month, sparking questions over the funding and independence of public television and radio. In the first public appearance of his election campaign, Macron told voters in Poissy, outside Paris, that scrapping the broadcasting licence fee made sense since he aimed to continue lowering taxes. Macron mentioned ending the licence fee of 138 euro (£115) a year – which is currently paid by around 27m homes – as part of a drive to help the increasing numbers of French people who are worried about making ends meet. The UK colour TV licence is £159. Politicians on the left warned that scrapping the licence fee would leave French public broadcasting at the whim of government budget decisions. The Socialist senator David Assouline tweeted that scrapping it was “serious” for the independence of public media and amounted to “dangerous demagoguery”. The Socialist presidential candidate Anne Hidalgo said scrapping the licence fee would “kill” the independence of public media, weaken public broadcasters in the face of growing private monopolies and “open the door to privatisation”. She said she would keep a licence fee but make it “fairer”. The centrist senator Catherine Morin-Desailly complained that Macron had not waited for a major public report on the issue of state media funding which is due to give its conclusions in June. The government spokesman Gabriel Attal sought to play down fears in an interview with the public France Inter radio, insisting: “We need a strong public media.” He said the government would continue to guarantee state broadcasters’ financing, independence and visibility in the long-term. Macron did not expand on how public broadcasting would be funded. Presidential candidates on the right had already announced they intended to scrap the licence fee, including Valérie Pécresse who is running for Nicolas Sarkozy’s party Les Républicains. The far-right’s Marine Le Pen has long said she wants to scrap the licence fee and privatise public television and radio in mainland France. The far-right former TV pundit Éric Zemmour has also vowed to scrap the licence fee and accused Macron of copying him. “The way he’s copying my manifesto, he’ll soon be suggesting ending immigration,” Zemmour said on Twitter. Christophe Castaner, a close Macron ally and head of the parliamentary grouping of Macron’s party, said there was a “huge difference” between Macron’s proposals and those of Le Pen and Zemmour. “They both want to scrap public-service broadcasting,” Castaner said, adding that Macron, by contrast, was “very attached to public-service broadcasting”. But he said the licence fee “is an unfair and archaic tax today”. Roch-Olivier Maistre, head of France’s media watchdog Arcom, said no candidate had yet detailed how to fund public service broadcasting without a licence fee. He said there must be a mechanism that allowed for “long-term funding and stability” as well as “visibility and independence.”",News/World news,Emmanuel Macron promises to scrap TV licence fee if re-elected,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/emmanuel-macron-promises-to-scrap-tv-licence-fee-if-re-elected

3/9/2022,"Cabaret, the revival of a musical that transformed a West End theatre into a flamboyant yet sinister 1930s Berlin nightclub, has been nominated for 11 Olivier awards ahead of next month’s ceremony. Eddie Redmayne, the club’s Emcee, and Jessie Buckley, who plays Sally Bowles, are in contention for best actor and best actress in a musical for their highly acclaimed performances. But the show is up against the equally lauded revival of the classic Cole Porter musical Anything Goes, which smashed box office records at the Barbican last year when it grossed £717,000 in a week. The show has nine nominations, including best actress in a musical for Sutton Foster, and best actor in a musical for Robert Lindsay. Both Cabaret and Anything Goes are nominated for best musical revival, along with Spring Awakening at the Almeida theatre in north London. Life of Pi, the stage version of Yann Martel’s Booker-winning novel featuring giant puppets and extraordinary special effects, leads the field for plays, with nine nominations, including best new play. The seven performers who play the puppet tiger are all nominated for best actor in a supporting role. Lily Allen is nominated as best actress for her West End debut in 2:22 A Ghost Story – which is also nominated as best new play – along with Cush Jumbo for the title role in Hamlet at the Young Vic. The National Theatre’s production of Larry Kramer’s The Normal Heart about the Aids epidemic in 1980s New York has five nominations, including best actor for Ben Daniels and best supporting actress for Liz Carr. Moulin Rouge! The Musical also has five nominations, while the Bob Marley musical Get Up, Stand Up! and Frozen get four apiece. Beverley Knight, who stars in The Drifters Girl, is among the nominees for best actress in a musical. Pride and Prejudice* (*Sort of), the joyful all-female retelling of Jane Austen’s classic novel that started life at the Edinburgh fringe, gets three nominations: best entertainment or comedy play, and two for best supporting actress. Despite positive reviews, the show was forced to close early in January after audiences plummeted due to Covid restrictions being reimposed. Nominations for best director are Rebecca Frecknall for Cabaret, Michael Longhurst for Constellations, Kathleen Marshall for Anything Goes and Max Webster for Life of Pi. Julian Bird, the chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and executive producer of the Olivier awards, said: “This year’s fantastic array truly demonstrates the breadth and diversity of London’s world-leading theatre industry, and its extraordinary creativity and resilience during an extremely challenging period for our sector. “After a two-year hiatus, we are delighted to be able to bring the theatre community together again to celebrate our brightest talents.” The awards ceremony takes place at the Royal Albert Hall on 10 April.

3/9/2022,"The French government has grounds to believe that Sanjeev’s Gupta’s GFG Alliance has “misappropriated” funds from a steel plant in Romania, according to court documents in a case involving one of the metal magnate’s companies. Gupta has launched legal action in London in a last-ditch attempt to reclaim a vast aluminium smelter in Dunkirk, northern France, after its takeover by a US private equity firm, American Industrial Partners (AIP). GFG has been under intense financial pressure since the collapse of its main lender, Greensill Capital. However, filings in the case suggest that legal authorities in France believe laws may have been broken by Gupta’s companies in separate dealings in Romania. GFG is under investigation by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over “suspected fraud, fraudulent trading and money laundering”, and French prosecutors are also investigating, but GFG has not so far faced charges. GFG denied that it has broken any laws. The smelter, the largest in Europe, is a highly sought-after asset in an important industry for the French government, and it is thought to consume as much as 1% of France’s electricity. Gupta, an Indian-born, Cambridge-educated commodities trader, bought the smelter from Rio Tinto in December 2018. However, AIP seized control of it in October 2021 after acquiring some of its debt, and the smelter has since become the subject of a bitter legal dispute. In a filing in response to GFG’s high court action, AIP wrote that its subsidiary, called Lightship, was unable to accept money offered as repayment for one of the GFG loans it held after a warning from the French government on 19 July. The defence filing said: “Lightship was informed that there were grounds to believe that the funds had been misappropriated from Liberty Galaţi (being a Romanian steel mill in the GFG Alliance), and would never have been able to pass KYC [know-your-customer] checks and AML [anti-money-laundering] scrutiny. Lightship understood, from that information, that there were grounds for concern as to the lawfulness of the transfer of funds from Liberty Galaţi.” GFG’s Romanian operations, including the large steelworks in Galaţi, a port city on the river Danube, have already come under significant scrutiny. A Czech government minister last year called for an investigation into the sale of carbon credits worth £40m from a Czech steelworks to Liberty Galaţi. A GFG Alliance spokesperson said: “Carbon credits are assets of a company and in common with other large industrial companies, Liberty Steel Group businesses trade carbon credits as part of the usual course of business. That includes transactions to buy and to sell credits according to their business requirements and according to the market price.” Gupta also owns a small bank, the Bucharest-based Banca Română de Credite și Investiții (BRCI). GFG previously denied that any of the funds tendered to AIP had any connection to BRCI. There were already “a number of matters of concern” before the French government’s intervention, AIP said in its filing, including the SFO investigation and “extensive public reporting of allegations of fraud, fraudulent trading and money laundering”. AIP also highlighted that $180m funds were promised for debt repayment via Liberty Finance Management (LIG) Limited, another of Gupta’s companies not directly involved in the smelter’s operations. That company, whose accounts for 2020 are almost a year overdue, only had £33m in assets listed on its balance sheet in 2018 and £61m in 2019. “That increased the risk that the funds may have been derived from tainted transactions by, or within, the GFG Alliance,” AIP alleged. “There were obvious concerns about the source of the funds.”. The alleged suggestion by the French government that GFG may have “misappropriated” money from Romania could have serious implications for Gupta’s attempts to refinance his other businesses, including those in the UK. Under UK law companies may not receive money if they believe it may have come from unlawful conduct, and they must carry out strict checks on customers. After an acquisition spree which saw Gupta snap up tired assets ranging from huge mines in Australia to steel and aluminium plants in the UK, the US and across Europe, the tycoon has been under intense pressure to find new funds after the collapse of Greensill a year ago on Tuesday. GFG on Monday said it had injected an unspecified amount of money into Liberty Steel in the UK, and that it had persuaded HM Revenue and Customs to drop winding up petitions for four Liberty companies. The filing alleged that AIP asked GFG several times for information on the source of the funds to repay its loan, but that GFG was only able to provide “certain limited documents filed at Companies House and a copy of Mr Gupta’s passport”. They “omitted to say anything about the actual source of the funds”, the filing said. GFG claimed that AIP had bought the loans in order to “appropriate” the smelter, and a source briefed on the negotiations claimed that GFG received offers of more than $1bn (£760m), five times more than the roughly $200m offered by AIP. AIP in its filing claimed that GFG had in fact asked it to buy the debt to protect GFG from insolvency after it missed scheduled repayments. A GFG Alliance spokesperson said: “Many of the claims in AIP’s filing rest on undisclosed documents and alleged conversations with third parties. There was no misappropriation of group money from any company. We took legal advice and thorough steps to ensure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, and are confident that the transfer of funds to repay AIP did not breach any of them.” The spokesperson said that “AIP never had any intention of accepting funds, from GFG or anyone else” to repay the loans. AIP used a “premeditated, predatory manoeuvre to seize a valuable asset on the cheap”, the spokesperson said. “AIP’s defence is as cynical as its original expropriation of our asset. We reject AIP’s specious interpretation of events.”",News/Business,Steel tycoon Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG alleged to have ‘misappropriated’ funds in Romania,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/steel-tycoon-sanjeev-guptas-gfg-alleged-to-have-misappropriated-funds-in-romania
3/9/2022,"Spain has announced plans to ban influencers, TV presenters and sports stars from advertising unhealthy food and drink to children. Under the proposals, which have just been put out for public consultation, anyone in a position to influence children would be forbidden to market food or drink that is high in sugar, sodium, salt or fat. “The ban would prohibit appearances in commercial communications by parents, educators, teachers, children’s TV professionals, sportspeople, artists, influencers, and people or characters – be they real or fictional – who may, by dint of their careers, be likely to represent a model or example for these minors,” Spain’s consumer affairs ministry said in its draft decree. The ministry described an influencer as “a person with a high level of influence over children and young people because of their large number of followers on social or digital media, and who interacts through messages on networks, blogs, posts, videos, or similar media”. It said high-profile figures who were popular among children would also be sought to participate in educational and public health campaigns to promote “physical activity and health, sustainable and responsible eating habits”. The move comes five months after Spain’s consumer affairs minister, Alberto Garzón, said he would ban advertisements for unhealthy foods that are aimed at children on TV, online, on social media and in apps, in cinemas, newspapers and on the radio. The ban would apply to items such as chocolate, cakes, biscuits, energy bars, juices, energy drinks and ice creams. Garzón, an economist who is the coordinator for the United Left alliance in the coalition government, said the measures were needed to tackle “the serious public health problem of childhood obesity”. A 2019 study found that 40.6% of Spanish children aged six to nine were over their recommended weight, of whom 17.3% were classed as obese. The plans were swiftly seized on by opponents of Spain’s Socialist-led coalition government. Ismael Sirio, then social media chief for the conservative People’s party, tweeted a picture of himself stuffing his face with chocolate and surrounded by confectionery, while the party’s president of the Madrid region accused the government of double standards, tweeting: “Drugs, yes. Sweets, no.” Garzón has also been criticised by rightwing politicians, Spain’s meat industry – and some of his cabinet colleagues – for calling on Spaniards to reduce their meat consumption for the sake of the planet and the good of their health and for contrasting the quality of extensively farmed meat with that produced on intensive megafarms.",News/World news,Spain plans ban on influencers pushing unhealthy foods to children,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/spain-plans-ban-on-influencers-pushing-unhealthy-foods-to-children
3/9/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine is being bolstered by $285m (£217m) in oil payments made every day by European countries, new analysis by the Transport & Environment (T&E) thinktank has found. Russia received $104bn from its crude, petrol and diesel exports to Europe last year, more than twice the $43bn it took from gas shipments, the study estimated. The analysis by the European clean-transport NGO was published shortly before the US and UK moved to ban Russian oil imports, and as Shell announced plans to shut down its Russian petrol stations and oil spot purchases. “Gas is understandably a worry, but it is oil that is funding Putin’s war,” said William Todts, T&E’s director. “Relying on it leaves Europeans dangerously exposed to rising prices in an increasingly uncertain world.” Europe’s dependence on Russia for about a quarter of its crude oil imports has helped to spur US pressure for an import ban, even as Brent crude prices have surged as high as $139 a barrel. Russia’s deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, said on Monday that any rejection of Russian oil would have “catastrophic consequences” and could send prices as high as $300 a barrel. Europe imported more than 200m tonnes of oil from Russia each year between 2004 and 2017, even increasing its purchases in the two years after Russia seized Crimea in 2014. The energy stranglehold held by Russia and other countries with poor human rights records underlines the urgent need to change to clean energy solutions, T&E says. “We should not simply swap Russian oil for Saudi oil,” Todts said. “It’s time to greatly improve transport efficiency and turbocharge the electrification of transport to drive down our oil consumption.” Russia is the source of almost four in every five oil barrels in Slovakia and two-thirds of those in Poland, Lithuania and Finland, while in Germany 29.7% of oil products come from Russia, the study says. The UK and Italy import about 12% of their oil and petroleum products from Russia, while in Portugal the figure is just 4%. Restrictions on Russian oil imports were absent from an EU energy strategy launched in Brussels today, which instead focused on gas supply storage and diversification. Even so, “nothing is off the table”, the EU’s green deal commissioner, Frans Timmermans, said on Monday. “The barbarism that Putin is now showing in Ukraine needs to be met with resolve, and also with measures that hurt him, even if they might hurt us as well.” Economic pain from an embargo would be felt keenly in Germany, Europe’s biggest Russian oil importer, which paid out $23.6bn to Moscow last year, followed by Poland ($14.7bn) and the Netherlands ($11.4bn). The Labour party’s energy spokesman, Ed Milliband, told the Guardian: “It is the right decision to ban imports of Russian oil. We need to do everything possible to isolate the Putin regime. “This approach further underlines the need for a decisive move toward clean energy to improve our resilience as a country and to protect us from rocketing energy prices.”",News/Business,"European oil receipts boosting Putin’s war chest by $285m a day, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/european-oil-receipts-boosting-putins-war-chest-study-finds
3/9/2022,"Two million people have now fled the bloodshed in Ukraine and with many more expected to do so, this could be the worst refugee crisis since the second world war. Seven decades ago in 1951, after the horrors of the world wars, the UK and other nations came together to sign the UN convention on refugees. It sets out that how a person arrives seeking protection does not matter. What matters is why – escaping war, conflict and oppression. Yet today we have a government that appears to show a callous disregard for the convention. It isn’t giving all Ukrainians fleeing violence the opportunity to come to our country as a refugee (Priti Patel under fire over chaotic Ukrainian refugee policy, 7 March). Instead, by setting up a limited and restricted family scheme and making a vague promise to establish some kind of humanitarian sponsorship programme, its response looks chaotic, heartless and unkind. At the same time, it is pushing ahead with its cruel nationality and borders bill, which will undermine the right to refugee protection and criminalise Ukrainians, Afghans and others who, through no fault of their own, are forced to make their own way to safety and arrive without all the necessary documentation. It seems that the government has chosen to send a clear message to refugees from Ukraine and elsewhere that they are not welcome. Now, more than ever, is the time to strengthen, not weaken, our commitment to the UN convention on refugees, and ensure that we provide protection to those who have lost everything.Enver Solomon Refugee Council, Ben Jackson Asylum Reform Initiative, Jenni Regan Imix, Dr Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah Oxfam GB, Kirsty McNeill Save the Children, Sonya Sceats Freedom from Torture, Beth-Gardiner Smith Safe Passage, Tim Naor Hilton Refugee Action, Sabir Zazai Scottish Refugee Council, Nicole Francis Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association and 34 others  On reading Simon Jenkins’ article (Ukrainian refugees, meet Britain’s ‘hostile environment’.

It has been self-sabotaged by a deliberately tangled legal and procedural approach towards asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa. It has ignored pleas from advocates for refugee rights to open up safe routes to the UK. Instead, it has spent the last 10 years trying to wheedle out of its responsibilities under the refugee convention by introducing increasingly stringent and inhumane policies that have pandered to ill-informed prejudice. Now, it is furiously trying to undo the cruel procedures it has put in place. It is trying to unlock a door that has been locked for so long that it’s rusted up.

Elsewhere, the former foreign secretary David Owen has said that Putin’s aggressive behaviour may be a consequence of taking anabolic steroids, a neuropsychologist that it may be the result of “hubris syndrome” affecting his frontal lobes, and another expert that the problem may be that he is suffering the cognitive effects of long Covid. Such pathologising of political actions as symptoms of mental disorder is really just a variant of psychiatric name-calling – a form of playground insult that we could do without. It demeans those with genuine mental health problems and infantilises public discussion about serious matters. Do we really think that the Ukraine invasion is the result of an aggressive impulse by somebody who has taken leave of his senses? Or that one man can run not just a complex military adventure, but a whole country without the collusion of others in it for the power, money, sex or whatever motivates them? Malignant despots and buffoon politicians like Boris Johnson are symptoms of the system that allows them to stay where they are, their endurance reflecting not just something about their callous self-interest but also the values of those on whose support they depend.

3/9/2022,"After the Notting Hill and Nottingham riots of 1958, which came after a series of racist attacks on Black communities, Trinidadian-born journalist and activist Claudia Jones responded by putting on a series of cultural events that would later be recognised as a precursor to Notting Hill Carnival. Jones said that she wanted the celebrations, held in St Pancras Town Hall, to “wash the taste of Notting Hill and Nottingham out of our mouths”. Famously, the slogan for this first carnival was: “a people’s art is the genesis of their freedom”. Because we often use art to find moments of joy and escape from the drudgery of everyday life, there is a temptation to see art as something that transcends politics. But this couldn’t be further from the truth. As Jones observed, it is precisely art’s capacity for joy that makes it inherently political; the choice to keep surviving, laughing, creating and partying in the face of oppression. For me, much of art’s political significance also lies in its ability to record our subjective realities across time. While no one is guaranteed a widespread audience for their work, almost anyone can create art or engage in culture. For Caribbean people, whose histories have been systematically erased over hundreds of years of enslavement and colonialism, this has offered a small opportunity to document our own histories from below, so that our parents’ and grandparents’ stories do not go to the grave with them. It is these reflections that I carried with me through the doors of the Tate Britain’s exhibition Life Between Islands, which explores the relationship between Britain and the Caribbean through art from the 1950s onwards. Separated into chronological sections, the exhibition journeys from the Windrush generation and the Caribbean Artists’ Movement all the way through to the present. It also seeks to interrogate the nature of time itself; the gallery text draws on Stuart Hall’s statement that “detours through the past” are necessary “to make ourselves anew”. As a third-generation Caribbean living in the UK, the section of the exhibition that I am most drawn to is Pressure, which looks at the work of Black British people around my mother’s age. I grew up hearing stories of blues parties, uprisings and National Front marches, but have rarely seen these oral histories affirmed in the mainstream cultural sphere. Sitting in Michael McMillan’s installation, The West Indian Front Room, which documents the distinct aesthetic of the 1970s British Caribbean home, I text my mum pictures of the kitsch floral carpet, busy yellow wallpaper and crochet doilies, hoping for a reaction. “I don’t find this strange,” she quickly replies. “I find it very familiar. That’s my house – I grew up there.” I feel silly – what seems like an immersive act of time travel for me is an unremarkable, not-so-distant memory for her. And yet, it is a small reminder of how these histories fall through the cracks between generations. Memory is also crucially important when approaching Black British activism. While it is common for detractors to insist that Black Lives Matter is a new American import, Horace Ové’s images capture African American writer and activist James Baldwin’s speech at the West Indian Student Union in Earl’s Court in 1968. Neil Kenlock, the official photographer of the British Black Panther party, also showcases photos of Young Black girls wearing Black Panther schoolbags, Black Power demonstrations, and portraits of the radical Black British feminist Olive Morris. A number these photographs seem to fit with Stuart Hall’s idea of “histographs” – a mix of history and photography. Then there is Dominica-born Tam Joseph’s painting, The Sky at Night, which depicts the Broadwater Farm uprising that followed the death of Cynthia Jarrett in police custody. These works bring to life the fact that there is a firm tradition of Black organising and rebellion in Britain. If we don’t hold on to these histories, we risk trying to reinvent the wheel and framing every conversation as “new”. While art may be the genesis of our freedom, it is also a powerful vehicle for documenting our lack of freedom. Each of those documented in Black British art of the past – police violence, a racist media machine, the looming threat of the far right – are unsettlingly familiar. Spirit of the Carnival, another work painted by Tam Joseph in 1982, feels closest to home for me. In the painting, a mob of police with riot shields form a circle around a masked Notting Hill carnival masquerader adorned head-to-toe in orange and yellow feathers. It evokes the image of people crowded around a roaring fire. A police dog lurches and gnashes at the reveller at the centre of the painting. Joseph’s piece hauntingly captures an ongoing cycle: where Black people carve out new paths towards joy and resistance, and find those spaces plagued by the same old violence. There is something exhausting about the relevance or even perceived “freshness” of Joseph’s piece today – that there are such obvious through-lines between the past and the present. But I am also reminded that history is not linear, and that, crucially, it is slow. As time ticks on and movements shape shift, art will always bear witness to our struggles, and we will always bear witness to art. Micha Frazer-Carroll is an arts columnist for The Independent.

3/9/2022,"The Russian gymnast who provoked global anger by wearing a propaganda symbol in support of the invasion of Ukraine on a World Cup podium has insisted that he has no regrets – and would even do the same again if he gets the chance. Ivan Kuliak is facing a lengthy ban from gymnastics after attaching a letter “Z” to his leotard before receiving his bronze medal in the parallel bars in Doha on Saturday, in a competition won by Ukraine’s Illia Kovtun. The symbol was initially used by the Russian military to distinguish its tanks, troop carriers and other vehicles, but the Russian Defence Ministry has now issued a statement saying that the “Z” means victory. Kuliak’s actions were immediately condemned as “shocking behaviour” by the International Gymnastics Federation, who then asked its Gymnastics Ethics Foundation to open disciplinary proceedings against the Russian. But while the 20-year-old now faces the possibility of a long ban and potentially losing his bronze medal, he was defiant when questioned by Russia Today on Tuesday. When Kuliak was asked if he regretted his act, he replied: “Not at all. If there was a second chance and I would again have to choose whether to enter with the letter ‘Z’ on my chest or not, I would do exactly the same. “I saw it on our military and looked at what this symbol means,” added Kuliak, who received training with the Russian military last year. “It turned out to be ‘for victory’ and ‘for peace’. I didn’t wish anything bad on anyone. I just showed my position. As an athlete, I will always fight for victory and play for peace.” Kuliak was unable to wear the Russian flag on Saturday as it had already been banned by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG). Since Monday all Russian and Belarusian gymnasts, officials and judges have also been suspended from all future FIG-sanctioned competitions.",Sport/Sport,Unrepentant gymnast Ivan Kuliak would show ‘Z’ insignia for Russia again,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/08/gymnast-ivan-kuliak-says-he-would-show-support-for-russia-again
3/9/2022,"The internet is no place for reasonable discussion. This is a lesson that was recently learned in the most painful way by Auckland resident Ryan Nixon, who last weekend made the innocent mistake of asking Twitter whether there were more doors or wheels in the world. A whopping 223,347 people replied and filled out his poll, with 53.6% of them guessing there were more wheels in the world. One guy worked out a complex formula on a piece of paper. Others argued that a wheel can be a door but a door cannot be a wheel. One particularly deep thinker pointed out that, while wheels are a human invention, doors “are primal – even celestial – in nature”. The debate, which will never be definitively resolved, continues. Sorry for putting it into your brain. This sort of pointless argument has become an important part of online life. Who could possibly forget the palaver about The Dress in 2015, when a woman took a photo of her wedding outfit and then had an argument with her daughter about whether it was white and gold or blue and black? At its peak, 11,000 tweets were posted about The Dress every minute, as friends and families tore themselves apart in disagreement. It became so heated that scientific papers were written about the phenomenon. As fun as it is to debate colours of things with strangers, The Dress debate had a definitive answer: a cursory amount of research takes you back to where the dress was bought, which quickly and conclusively proved that it was blue and black. If Doors v Wheels has any sort of precedent, it’s How Would A Dog Wear Trousers from 2015, in which a Facebook user asked if trousers for dogs should cover the bottom 50% of a dog (four legs, tummy, no tail) or the back 50% (back legs, tail, no front legs). This is perhaps the hardest question of them all to answer. Logic says that a pair of trousers should cover up all your legs, but your heart tells you that a pair of trousers with four legs isn’t a pair of trousers at all. A dog wearing trousers on its hind quarters, meanwhile, looks more human – but, again, that argument is undone by the fact that a dog isn’t human. Humanity does potentially have the resources to carry out a full global audit of the world’s doors and wheels. But none of us, as long as we live, will ever possess the ability to ask a dog what sort of trousers it would theoretically prefer to wear. The question itself is a fool’s errand. So, despite humanity’s inherent need for objective truth, there can never be a conclusive answer – to this, or indeed many of the internet’s daftest debates. And that, in the end, is why we love them.",News/Technology,Are there more wheels or doors in the world?

3/9/2022,"The mezzo-soprano Josephine Veasey, who has died aged 91, was famed for her interpretations of Dido in Berlioz’s Les Troyens and Fricka in Wagner’s Ring, but was also a familiar and much admired singer at Covent Garden throughout the 1960s and 70s, making 780 appearances in 60 roles there. Having the good fortune to reach her vocal maturity at a time when the Royal Opera had its own company of singers who were encouraged to essay a wide range of roles, she was able to move at her own pace, during her years as a company principal (1955–82), from lighter roles such as Dorabella in Così Fan Tutte and Rosina in Il Barbiere di Siviglia to heavier ones including Iphigénie (Iphigénie en Tauride), Preziosilla (Il Forza del Destino), Eboli (Don Carlos), Fricka and Waltraute in the Ring, Brangäne (Tristan und Isolde), Venus (Tannhäuser), Kundry (Parsifal) and first Cassandra, then Dido in Berlioz’s epic masterpiece. Her approach to Berlioz came through the role of Marguerite in La Damnation de Faust (which she sang under Solti on the opening night of the 1963 Edinburgh festival) and the song cycle Les Nuits d’Été. She was then invited to take the role of Cassandra at the BBC Proms performance under Colin Davis in 1968, graduating to the lead role of the Queen of Carthage the following year in the new production at Covent Garden under the same conductor. She also took the role of Dido in the Philips recording, released in 1969. The idiomatic diction and heroic strength she brought to the part, together with her commanding delivery and a tender, sensuous quality in the more intimate passages, made her a near-ideal interpreter of the role. That regal aura stood her in good stead for the part of Fricka, consort of Wotan, the ruler of the gods, in the Ring. It was Georg Solti, then music director of Covent Garden, who encouraged her to learn the role, and beginning with Das Rheingold in 1964 she took it both in the Hans Hotter production then current and in the new staging by Götz Friedrich from 1974 to 1978, deploying her ample tone to imperious effect. She was then invited to sing the part under Herbert von Karajan in Salzburg, and at La Scala and the Metropolitan, New York, and on his recording of the cycle. However, she never enjoyed working with Karajan, and when he dropped her unceremoniously from the role, she bravely wrote to inform him that she had no intention of ever working with him again. Born in Camberwell, south London, Josephine was the daughter of Ivy (nee Dunn) and Frank Veasey, a scientific instrument maker. The family, also including her elder sister, Doreen, were evacuated to Crawley Down in West Sussex during the second world war, and on leaving her secondary school in East Grinstead, she took a job with the Civil Service Clerical Association (now PCS). However, at the age of 18, having had singing lessons from Audrey Langford, she joined the chorus at Covent Garden. Then she moved on to Opera for All, a small touring company, and in 1951 married Ande Anderson, a director on the staff of Covent Garden. After she had given birth to her children, Nick and Charlotte, she toured with the Covent Garden company as Cherubino (The Marriage of Figaro), and made her debut at the Royal Opera as the Page in Salome in July 1955, followed that November by a highly praised Shepherd Boy in Tannhäuser. It took some years for the larger roles to come her way. “I don’t have the kind of pushing personality that is always asking for new parts,” she said. “I suppose I’m very English in accepting what comes along.” On the other hand, as she also noted, this meant she was not pressurised into taking more strenuous roles that might have harmed her voice. But eventually, along with Berlioz and Wagner, she performed at Covent Garden as Mrs Sedley (Peter Grimes, 1960), Maddalena (Rigoletto) and Mistress Page in Franco Zeffirelli’s Falstaff (both 1961), and in the title role of Carmen (1967). Occasional appearances at Glyndebourne included Clarice in Rossini’s rarely performed La Pietra del Paragone (1964), in which she demonstrated her comic capabilities, Octavian (Der Rosenkavalier, 1965) and Charlotte (Massenet’s Werther, 1969). For her Paris Opéra debut in 1969 she sang Dido, returning for Kundry in 1973; that year, too, she sang Eboli at San Francisco. A high extension to her lustrous mezzo voice enabled her to flourish in some soprano roles, such as Faure’s Pénélope and Selika in Meyerbeer’s L’Africaine, both of which she recorded for radio. In Ernest Ansermet’s recording of Debussy’s Pelléas et Mélisande (1964) she took the role of Geneviève. Other recordings included comparatively rare ventures into bel canto, such as Agnese in Bellini’s Beatrice di Tenda alongside Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavarotti, and Adalgisa in the same composer’s Norma at the Théâtre d’Antique, Orange, in the south of France, alongside Montserrat Caballé and Jon Vickers. She created the roles of Andromache in Tippett’s King Priam (Covent Garden, 1962) and the Emperor in Henze’s We Come to the River (Covent Garden, 1976). In 1980 she gave a riveting performance as Gertrude in Ambroise Thomas’s Hamlet at the Buxton festival. Two years later she bade farewell to Covent Garden and the stage, singing Herodias in Richard Strauss’s Salome. Among her favourite concert repertoire were Handel oratorios and the mezzo part in Verdi’s Requiem, which she recorded under Leonard Bernstein. In 1970 she was appointed CBE. After she stopped performing she taught singing at the Royal Academy of Music and was a voice consultant at English National Opera. There her pupils included Sally Burgess, Felicity Palmer and – for Ko-Ko’s little list in Jonathan Miller’s production of The Mikado (1986) – Eric Idle. Her marriage ended in divorce in 1969. She is survived by Charlotte, three grandchildren, Clare, Kate, and Ben, and three nieces. Nick died in 2020.

3/9/2022,"‘There’s going to be a war! What the heck do Sophy’s knickers matter?” What indeed, Felicity Kendal. This week marks the 30th anniversary of The Camomile Lawn, a bosom-heaving period drama that broke ratings records back in spring 1992. All is fair in love, war and lingerie. Revisiting it, the hammier-than-Peppa-Pig five-parter often feels like a spoof. And wow, there’s a lot of sex and swearing in it. No wonder it was known as “The Camomile Porn” by the popular press. This is Game of Thrones with gravy-painted legs. Or perhaps Euphoria with a ration book. All ravishing Cornish coastlines and lip-quivering passion, Channel 4’s starry adaptation of Mary Wesley’s beloved semi-autobiographical novel came as a welcome burst of nostalgic sunshine in PM John Major’s grey, boring Britain. It was written nearly a decade earlier when Wesley was 70 – part of a remarkable burst of creativity in her twilight years. This late bloomer only turned to her typewriter as a way to earn some cash after she was left impoverished by the death of her second husband. She proceeded to bash out 10 bestsellers in the last 20 years of her life. The sumptuous miniseries was directed by theatre titan Peter Hall – who cast his daughter Rebecca as orphaned Sophy, the soul of the story. It’s an astonishingly accomplished turn from nine-year-old Hall, who radiates star quality in her first professional role. Wesley’s text was faithfully adapted by screenwriter Ken Taylor, who had previously turned Paul Scott’s The Jewel in the Crown into a prime-time blockbuster. Pulling in more than 7 million viewers, The Camomile Lawn became Channel 4’s top-rated drama ever – a record it still holds, with only robo-thriller Humans and Russell T Davies’s It’s a Sin coming close. At a time when most homes had only four channels, The Camomile Lawn’s potboiler plot and tabloid notoriety meant it attracted one-third of the total TV audience. The handsome saga traced the intertwining lives of three genteel families. As storm clouds gathered over Europe in 1939, four teenage cousins visited a clifftop country pile in Cornwall for one last idyllic holiday. Their lives, as dramatic convention dictates, would never be the same again. Wartime sequences were intercut with scenes from a family funeral four decades later, as the characters were reunited at a graveside. But who had died? Who had married who and were they being faithful? Who was a famous novelist and who had grown “fat and respectable”? And who was about to call a fellow mourner the C-word and throw a punch? This was an upmarket soap in the vein of Downton or Bridgerton. A major draw was the pan-generational ensemble cast. Kendal starred as matriarch Helena Cuthbertson, owner of the enviable Cornish mansion with its eponymous fragrant lawn. It was Helena’s reminiscences in her dotage – with Kendal wearing a ropey wig, even ropier ageing makeup and slugging single malt from a silver hip flask – which framed the story. Youngsters were played by Jennifer Ehle (the flighty, ludicrously named Calypso) and Toby Stephens (her brooding suitor Oliver), both making their screen debuts. Helena’s harrumphing husband Richard was winningly played by Paul Eddington. A clever piece of casting, since he and Kendal’s characters always had an unrequited vibe in The Good Life. The older Calypso was played by Rosemary Harris, Ehle’s real-life mother. Claire Bloom took over as midlife Sophy. The family were joined by identical brothers from the local rectory, only ever referred to as “the twins”, along with Max and Monika Erstweiler, a Jewish refugee couple from Austria. Max became a famous violinist and, despite his ’Allo ’Allo accent and Einstein-esque grey fright wig, somehow managed to seduce pretty much every female. “You open the legs, ja?” he purred to one paramour. However, it was mainly Calypso who put the phwoar-time into wartime. We followed her transformation from prissy virgin into prolific saucepot – a metaphor for how the war swept aside traditional morality. As Wesley herself said: “We were a flighty generation. We’d been brought up so repressed. War freed us. We felt if we didn’t do it now, we might never get another chance. It got to the stage where one woke up in the morning, reached across the pillow and thought, ‘Let’s see, who is it this time?’” Wesley poured those memories into The Camomile Lawn, which saw all manner of bed-hopping and “raunchy romping”, as it was termed in tabloidese. Ehle’s screen career was launched with a string of nude scenes. “I haven’t done any nudity since and never will again,” she later said. “I didn’t realise there would be so much of it, but no one forced me to do it. The first time I felt really shocked – then came a whole day of naked scenes. I went home and was physically sick. I had forgotten that I’d be seen naked in a lot of living rooms.” Predictably, there was lots of female flesh on display, with just the odd male buttock as a nod to equal opportunities nudity. One memorable scene saw Calypso go into labour under a kitchen table during the blitz, with schoolgirl Sophy acting as midwife. As furniture fell and plaster crumbled around them, Calpyso screamed, “Fuck Hitler! Bugger that bomb!” while she gave birth to a son. Cousin Polly (Tara Fitzgerald) formed a proto-throuple with the twins. She had their children but nobody knew who fathered which. Felicity Kendal, a pin-up for men of a certain age, steamed up their spectacles with a woodland sex scene that wouldn’t look out of place in current period romps Poldark or Outlander. Even the seemingly stuffy Richard and Helena swapped partners with Max and Monika. “May I fuck you now?” asked another character who was “fearfully randy”. Oliver demanded his “comforts” whenever he returned home from military postings, at one point telling Calypso: “I’ve got an erection. I want to poke it into you.” Steady on, old chap. It all gave pensioner Wesley a reputation as a purveyor of posh smut. Her style was described as “arsenic without the old lace” and “Jane Austen with sex”. Her family disapproved of this late-career pivot. Her brother called her novels “filth”, while her estranged sister strongly objected to The Camomile Lawn, claiming some characters were based on their parents. It wasn’t until the last year of her life that Wesley collaborated with biographer Patrick Marnham on an authorised memoir, Wild Mary. The title referenced her childhood nickname and her liberated sex life. Wesley shared her memories from her sickbed, saying: “Have you any idea of the pleasure of lying in bed for six months, talking about yourself to a very intelligent man? My deepest regret was that I was too old and ill to take him into bed with me.” Nowadays The Camomile Lawn comes with a warning, not just about strong language and sexual scenes but “offensive, racist language and attitudes”. These were indeed different times. Racial slurs were bandied about, as was the word “Bitch!” (mainly on the rare occasions when women declined an invitation to bed). Blimpish old gents in crumpled cream suits blustered that “concentration camps must be splendid places”. Calypso boasted about meeting “awfully nice” Nazis while skiing. Uncle Richard admitted an unhealthy interest in young girls, with references to him “groping” his nieces – which everyone dismissed as a harmless eccentricity. At one point, a coastguard flashed “his pink snake” at 10-year-old Sophy and ended up being pushed off a cliff for his trouble. It’s a tale of toffs who are so pampered they don’t just own separate town and country houses – some have town and country spouses, too. Everyone goes “up to Oxford” from boarding school, dines at the Ritz or the Savoy, drinks like dehydrated sailors and demands kedgeree for breakfast. Uncle Richard nearly cops it when he ventures outside during a bombing raid to rescue a case of vintage claret. The Camomile Lawn is like a time capsule. A relic of a lost England. It’s Brideshead Revisited meets Ian McEwan’s Atonement, with Jilly Cooper drafted in to sex things up. The acting is stiff, stagy and laughably plummy, like a bad Radio 4 audio play. Stephens’ attempts to emote are often reminiscent of a parody by Victoria Wood or French and Saunders. Fittingly, proceedings climax in typically absurd fashion. There’s the sort of unconvincing, hysterically shrill laughter that might precede the credits of a bad sitcom, before Wesley’s nice-but-dim nymphos find themselves facing something truly dreadful. Something guaranteed to send a shiver down the spine of any right-thinking toff. As the series closes, some ghastly parvenu is overheard discussing his plans to dig up the camomile lawn and replace it with a swimming pool. Bally typical.

3/9/2022,"The Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson said Republicans should try again to repeal the Affordable Care Act if they take back power – then retreated, under fire from the Biden administration. Speaking to Breitbart News, a far-right site, on Monday, Johnson said Republicans could “actually make good on what we established as our priorities” if they won control of Congress in midterms this year and the presidency in 2024. “For example, if we’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare – I still think we need to fix our healthcare system – we need to have the plan ahead of time so that once we get in office, we can implement it immediately, not knock around like we did last time and fail.” When Republicans last controlled Congress and the White House, under Donald Trump, they failed to bring down the ACA. Popularly known as Obamacare, after the president who passed it, the law aims to provide affordable health insurance to those otherwise without it. It became law in 2010. The ACA has increased in popularity since Biden took office. As of last year, approximately 31 million Americans received healthcare coverage through the ACA. An additional 1.2 million enrolled during a special six-month period during the Covid pandemic. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has been reluctant to release details of what Republicans would do should they retake Congress in the midterms, with McConnell saying only an agenda will be revealed “when we take it back”. The Florida senator Rick Scott produced an 11-point plan but McConnell opposed it in public. Scott’s plan, Rescue America, includes building Trump’s promised border wall, a declaration that there are only two genders, eliminating the Department of Education and requiring all Americans to pay some form of income tax. “If we’re fortunate enough to have the majority next year, I’ll be the majority leader,” McConnell told reporters. “I’ll decide in consultation with my members what to put on the floor. “Let me tell you what would not be a part of our agenda. We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people and sunsets social security and Medicare within five years.” In his interview with Breitbart, Johnson said he supported parts of Scott’s plan. But his comments on Obamacare gave Democrats something of an open goal, in terms of highlighting another Republican attack on a popular law. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said: “Senate Republicans have a plan to gut healthcare, raise premiums and strip protections for pre-existing conditions. They also want to raise taxes on half of Americans, including seniors and working families. Don’t take my word for it, listen to [Senator Rick Scott] and [Senator Ron Johnson].” On Tuesday, Johnson released a statement about his comments. “During the radio interview I used our failure to repeal and replace Obamacare as an example of how we need to be prepared to deliver on whatever agenda items we decide to run on,” he said. “I was not suggesting repealing and replacing Obamacare should be one of those priorities.” Johnson said his focus was on fixing US healthcare and correcting Biden policies.",News/US news,Senator forced to backtrack after saying Republicans will repeal Obamacare,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/obamacare-senator-ron-johnson-republican-affordable-care-act
3/9/2022,"Azeem Rafiq has accused senior county leaders of dragging their feet instead of opening their arms in cricket’s push for diversity, saying he has been angered and frustrated by the continuing “resistance to anything that goes away from the status quo”, and that “it is becoming abundantly clear that the county system doesn’t want to welcome everyone”. Rafiq’s stinging evidence to parliament’s digital, culture, media and sport select committee last November, describing his experiences of discrimination, was followed soon after by publication of the ECB’s equity, diversity and inclusion plan. But the 31-year-old does not believe there has been sufficient action in the months since, and the Guardian revealed last week that county chairs are now seeking to exert more power over the game, including a return to having two ring-fenced seats on the ECB board. “Since DCMS a lot has happened, but from some of the stuff I’ve heard it’s becoming clear that the counties don’t actually see it, they don’t get it. Not all of them,” Rafiq said. “Since I spoke I don’t feel enough has changed. I don’t feel there’s enough of an energy to make changes. I think there’s some good people trying but as a whole in the county game there’s still a lot of resistance to anything that goes away from the status quo.” It was the Middlesex chair Michael O’Farrell, forced to apologise in January after telling the DCMS committee that British South Asians chose education over sport and that people in the “Afro-Caribbean community” preferred football and rugby to cricket, who wrote to the ECB on behalf of county chairs to suggest they be given greater power in a reorganised game. “The fact you’ve got Michael O’Farrell leading it, after his comments, it’s difficult to stomach to be honest,” said Rafiq, who spoke after an appearance at the two-day Include Summit on equality, diversity and inclusion in sport in Birmingham. “I think what seems to have been forgotten by these county chairs is, we’re in this place because of institutional racism, because of a lack of diversity, because of the game not being welcoming to everyone. The data’s there. And actually, I’m struggling to find the words, but it’s quite frustrating and it angers me that they’ve used that pressure to power grab for their own needs.” It was revealed on Tuesday that the ECB has set aside a budget of £1m to ensure that every county ground has a multi-faith prayer room before the start of the coming season. “It’s important, but I don’t think it’s a solution, far from it,” Rafiq said. “It’s what happens in that prayer room that shows if there’s going to be change. It can’t be, ‘The ECB action plan says we must have this, tick.’ That’s what a lot of it feels like. I’ve been battling with whether it’s the ECB, is it the counties – where is the resistance? I’m not saying the ECB is great, far from it, but I think it’s becoming abundantly clear that the county system doesn’t want to welcome everyone.” Rafiq now feels that his former county, Yorkshire, whose “woefully inadequate” response to his initial complaint of racism precipitated cricket’s inclusivity scandal, has become a positive example, despite the public resistance of Robin Smith, a former chair, to some of the changes introduced by the incumbent, Lord Patel. “Yorkshire’s ahead of [other counties] because they’ve accepted something. The rest, there’s been no diagnosis,” Rafiq said. “There needs to be a diagnosis of how deep the problem is at every individual county, because you can’t find a solution before knowing the problem. At Yorkshire, I genuinely feel there is a will to do the right thing. “The old guard are doing their best to stop it, and I think that’s embarrassing. These are people who have overseen an institution that has been proven to be institutionally racist. I’d tell them to look in the mirror, to be part of change, and be part of a Yorkshire which, as long as they get through the next few tough weeks, could really set an example of what can be achieved in a short space of time if there’s a real will to do the right thing.”",Sport/Sport,‘They don’t get it’: Azeem Rafiq accuses counties of dragging feet on diversity,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/08/azeem-rafiq-diversity-county-cricket-ecb
3/9/2022,"Many parts of Australia’s east coast are enduring a record wet start to the year, with frequent deluges and storms. Thousands of homes have been flooded in Queensland and New South Wales, while many more residents are noticing the effects of the damp and humid weather. In these conditions, mould thrives. And if not dealt with, mould growth can have adverse affects on health. Here, experts explain how to prevent mould taking hold, and what to do if it already has. Brad Prezant, an occupational hygienist describes mould as “a visible consequence of excessive dampness”. Mould usually looks like a “fibrous growth” on indoor surfaces like ceilings and walls, and can range from colourless to brown, yellow, green or blue. Tiny “thread like things” form its body, and contain very small spores that float in the air and spread when disturbed. Expect to see mould when there is an excess of moisture in the air, combined with an absence of ventilation. “If humidity stays above 85%, moisture absorbs into building materials and dusts on surfaces,” Prezant says. That absorbed moisture allows spores to germinate, which can cause a mass of mould to spread. Prof Dee Carter, of the University of Sydney’s school of life and environmental sciences says it is not surprising there has been an increase in mould in homes this year. As unprecedented flooding follows a humid La Nina summer, “substrates like roofs, ceilings, and wood are becoming more saturated … And this is where mould thrives”. Mould can lead to several respiratory health problems. “It can cause upper respiratory infection, and exacerbate asthma, especially when people are spending up to 24 hours a day in their homes,” Prezant says. Carter says people may experience what are referred to as “sick building symptoms”, where people get wheezy, sneezy, or suffer from headaches and irritated eyes. “These are classic allergy and asthma type symptoms,” she says. “That is because moulds give off volatile compounds that contaminate the air, and spores that irritate people’s airways.” Ventilation is the key. “If you take away the moisture, the mould won’t grow,” Prezant says. He suggests controlling indoor humidity with either an air conditioner or dehumidifier. Carter says it is best to run a dehumidifier for up to two hours a day per room. Preventing rain and humidity from getting indoors is also crucial – this means only opening windows for air circulation if the air outdoors is dry. Prezant suggests focusing on kitchen and bathroom ventilation. This includes turning fans on when excess water accumulates in bathrooms and avoiding unnecessary moisture entering an indoor space, like emptying wet clothes from a drying rack into rooms with no ventilation. “Houses are not designed to get wet,” he says. “So either don’t release moisture into it, or have sufficient ventilation.” There are different cleaning methods recommended depending on where the mould originated. If mould is growing in a spot like the bottom of a window, where glass meets wood, Prezant says “there might not be much moisture inside the wood”. In this scenario, he says mould is most likely a result of condensation on the glass plane dripping down and “you could just wipe it off”. When cleaning surface mould like this, Carter says to avoid “most bleach products on the market”. Instead, she recommends a vinegar solution of white vinegar from a supermarket, diluted in water to a ratio of 1:5. “Vinegar will clean mould off the surface and penetrate into the substrate to kill the mould.” Depending on the level of contamination, and concern about experiencing allergy symptoms, Carter recommends wearing a mask and gloves while cleaning mould. “Especially if it looks like it is getting hairy, or the surface looks powdery,” she says. Carter says to keep in mind that mould “might be disturbed as you are cleaning”. This may seed more mould growth. To avoid this, use the vinegar solution in a misting bottle, and spray the surface before touching it. Also avoid banging the surface, or doing anything disruptive that could dislodge spores and send them into the air. If dealing with high levels of moisture related to the escape of liquid from plumbing or indoor flooding, Prezant says a different approach is needed. If mould is growing as a result of the shower leaking, for instance, removing it involves bringing up the plaster board. “It won’t be so easily controlled until the leak is stopped,” Prezant says. Or if your ceiling is mouldy because of a leak in the roof, your ceiling plasterboard “may be soaked”. “You may wipe it off the paint surface, but water in the plasterboard and paper behind that paint is going to keep growing,” he says.

Black moulds in particular can produce potent toxins and require professionals to remediate the property. Experts would enter the affected building in protective gear to remove the contaminated material. If the material cannot be removed, they will “work on trying to kill that mould”. Prezant says contractors should also be used when dealing with extensive mould. He says experts will know how to stop the spread of mould in future by containing “all the tiny spores”. Prezant says there is not much difference between mould found on walls, and mildew found on clothes. The air is relatively still inside a wardrobe. If high-moisture air infiltrates the space, Prezant says you can expect some condensation on clothing, shoes and anything else in the wardrobe. Each material has a different propensity to grow mould – this will determine what items affected by mildew can be salvaged. Mildew growth is often superficial on leather footwear, for example. “It is possible the mould is growing on dust or dirt on the surface,” Prezant says. In that case, you can simply wipe it off. Alternatively, a purse made of woven fabric can absorb more moisture. “The mould may be intertwined with the textile fibres, and will be difficult to clean.”",News/Australia news,How to get rid of mould and mildew: a guide to post-flooding cleanup,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/how-to-get-rid-of-mould-and-mildew-a-guide-to-post-flooding-cleanup
3/9/2022,"Anthony Albanese will bemoan a lost decade of division and policy inertia under the Coalition, declaring he will take his lead from Bob Hawke, lifting productivity, boosting growth and using “cheap, renewable energy to transform our economy” if Labor wins the coming election. The Labor leader will use a speech to a business summit on Wednesday to present himself as a consensus figure with a “renewal” agenda. Albanese will say if Labor wins office in May, he will revive “the dormant national project to create wealth in a way that produces benefits for all Australians”. Albanese will tell Wednesday’s summit Australia needs to end the climate and culture wars and look for collaborative opportunities between governments, trade unions, businesses and civil society around “shared aims of growth and job creation”. The Labor leader will note Hawke managed to deliver growing wages and stronger business profits while safeguarding important social dividends – like Medicare and universal superannuation – and that reform program delivered “three decades of continuous economic growth”. Appealing to a sense of frustration in business circles that the prime minister lacks a significant policy agenda, Albanese will declare Morrison’s objective as prime minister has been “to sustain a sense of division” that the government has stoked to advance a partisan agenda. The Labor leader will argue Morrison does not see a legitimate role for government in driving economic growth and distributing the benefits. He will declare as a consequence, the Coalition has delivered “a decade of inertia”. “Australia has failed to move forward at the very time when global shifts, including the rise of renewable energy, have offered us great opportunities to transform our economy, boost growth and create new jobs,” Albanese will say. “If Labor is successful in May, Australia will stop standing still,” Albanese will say. “We’ll bound forward, determined to shape the changes sweeping the global economy in ways that serve the Australian people.” Albanese will say Labor’s policy agenda to boost productivity, economic growth and jobs includes the provision of cheaper childcare to encourage greater labour market participation, investments in the transformation of Australia’s energy grid, revitalising local manufacturing, and investing in skills, faster broadband, and other productivity-enhancing infrastructure. While styling himself in the consensus tradition of Hawke, Albanese will also borrow a maxim from John Howard, noting you never reach the finish line in the race for economic reform because there is always more to do to make the economy stronger and more productive. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He will declare Morrison is not even in the race. “The team leader has left the track,” the Labor leader will say. “He is over in the grandstand looking for photo opportunities.” With only weeks until the budget on 29 March – which is the staging post for the federal election – Albanese is looking for opportunities to present himself and Labor as safe change. Polls show a significant chunk of voters have not yet reached a settled view about Albanese. Morrison, who is seeking a fourth term for the Coalition at the coming election, has intensified efforts in recent weeks to define his opponent as a risk both on national security and economic management.

He argued Australians would be safer sticking with the incumbents. “The overlay of an uneven global recovery from the pandemic, unprovoked military aggression in Europe, in Ukraine, an energy and commodity price shock, and continued geostrategic risks in our own region – this all creates a highly complex and risky external environment,” Morrison said. “It’s no place for amateurs.” The prime minister told the summit the Coalition was “best-placed to continue to navigate Australia’s way through these incredibly difficult and uncertain times”. “We have demonstrated this time and again, as we have brought the Australian economy through some of the most difficult challenges in generations,” the prime minister said. “The record is there. Now is not the time to turn back. It is a time to stick with the economic plan and leadership that has been working for Australia and getting Australians into work.” Pressed during a question and answer session about criticism the government has faced over its lack of a reform agenda, Morrison said the government had reduced taxes, built infrastructure and adopted a target of net zero emissions by 2050. “I know there are some who attend the summit and may even sponsor it who think that economic reform in this country is about putting up the GST and … putting on a carbon tax,” Morrison said. “Let me be very clear again – I have no interest in putting up the GST or putting on a carbon tax.”",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese to embrace Labor luminary Bob Hawke’s consensus style if ALP wins election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/anthony-albanese-says-he-will-follow-bob-hawkes-lead-to-boost-wealth-for-all-australians
3/9/2022,"For her latest novel, Jane Caro spent 18 months researching coercive control and domestic abuse. To understand its complex machinations, she spoke to survivors, judges, police, lawyers, ex-prisoners and those working in the sector. The longtime writer and social commentator poured everything she learned into The Mother, a domestic thriller about a woman who becomes concerned when her daughter withdraws in a new marriage. The plot of the book arose from Caro’s anger at how little is being done to protect women in Australia, but it is also about how far a mother will go to protect her children. Caro herself is a mother of two, and has portraits of her children hanging in her living room. The pair of paintings are “utterly unsentimental” in artistic approach, but beloved items nonetheless. Here, she tells us why she’d grab those two portraits in a fire, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. On the wall above my TV are two separate portraits of my children painted by my friend Denise Morden. She painted them in the early 1990s, when they were both toddlers. Although she was usually a sculptor, she was going through a phase of painting young children. I was delighted when she asked if she could include my daughters in her next exhibition. Denise’s paintings of children – she has two of her own – are utterly unsentimental. The children stare unsmilingly from the canvas, challenging us with their uncompromising gaze. Morden’s children are not cute or sweet; they are furiously, mulishly themselves – especially my younger daughter. Denise’s painting captures an expression of sullen obstinacy that I remember vividly. My older daughter’s expression is more mischievous, perhaps, but she too stares at the viewer as if daring them to dismiss her as a mere child. Wherever I go, one thing always comes with me – some might call it an accessory. Currently it is a rounded brown leather version. The first one I had, however, was designed for men and I bought it in Bali. I used it daily until its chain corroded and became useless. I still miss it. It was a small, faux-snakeskin envelope-style bag suspended from a long, dullish-gold chain. I am often attracted to male accessories (I have bought many a man’s scarf) because I am allergic to the frilly embellishments and wishy-washy colours that so many designers believe suitable for women’s clothing. The point of the bag is that it is small, just big enough to carry my glasses, phone, credit cards, lipstick and now a mask. One of the five or so I have owned so far has variously been with me on planes, trains, camels, treks, climbs, bush walks, boats, ferries and a helicopter. I expect to have one with me – maybe on the bedside table in hospital or at home (if I am lucky) – when I die. I’m cheating a bit here, because it’s many items. I grievously miss (and suspect I always will) the loss of 30 years’ worth of collected earrings. Our house was broken into a few years ago and the thief snatched my jewellery box off my dressing table. Once they opened it, I am sure they just threw it away. Everything in it was worthless (I am not a diamonds and pearls kind of girl) except to me. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning I began collecting those earrings in the 80s, when big was fashionable. I couldn’t really have big hair – I am not genetically blessed in the follicle department – but I could wear statement earrings. I used to work opposite the legendary Cash Palace on Oxford Street and I’d spend up big. They were all just paste and plastic – the epitome of costume jewellery – but I loved them. I had wooden elephants so big that I would only ever wear one, never both. I had architectural black ones with rods that bounced and twirled on invisible thread. I had all the colours of the rainbow and I wore them for years. I have begun amassing another collection, of course, but it’s not the 80s and it never will be again, and I miss those earrings my 20-year-old self chose with such bold precision.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Three things with Jane Caro: ‘It’s not the 80s and it never will be again’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/09/three-things-with-jane-caro-its-not-the-80s-and-it-never-will-be-again
3/9/2022,"Mountains of waste pulled from flood-ravaged homes and businesses along Australia’s east coast are heading for landfill sites and temporary storage, but questions are being raised over a New South Wales government plan to store the rotting mounds at a quarry. In Brisbane, the city’s mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said the floods had generated a year’s worth of landfill. Almost 30,000 cubic metres have already been dropped at council tips and recycling centres, but how much more is left was not known. Councils hit by floods were worried piles of rubbish could become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and attract rats and mice. Waste industry groups called for better planning for disasters, saying there was a lack of areas at landfill sites that were being held in contingency for major events. In flooded Lismore in the Northern Rivers region of NSW, the council, contractors, fire and rescue officers and defence personnel were collecting more than 1,000 tonnes of flood waste every day and moving it to a temporary site at a tip in East Lismore. John Walker, the general manager of Lismore city council, said the state government was taking over the job of collecting and removing the waste. From Wednesday, he said, all the waste would start to be transferred to a quarry site the state government had identified near the village of Tevan – 30km east. Walker said: “Some of this problem is it’s just unsightly. But if there’s food, it rots and then we can get vermin coming in.” He said the council anticipated it would be two weeks before all the debris was cleared. “People there are traumatised,” he said. “It just sits on the street. Ultimately it’s totally depressing and it’s really important we clean it up. “I think recycling is off the agenda. It’s just a pile of mess.” Adam Guise, a Lismore councillor for the Greens, says the sight of the wall of flood-damaged materials along kerbs through the town was “absolutely heartbreaking.” “For me, as an environmentalist, this is a tragedy. This is the side effect of disasters like this where so much waste is generated. Everything from people’s homes is on the street. The environmental consequences are astronomical.” Guise’s own house in north Lismore, which escaped flooding in 2017, was inundated this time with water up to the ceilings. “I expected maybe a foot or two in the house, but it got to the ceilings. We lost everything that was in the house. It’s all on the kerb like everyone else’s. “We should be pulling out all the stops to generate facilities that can – en masse – deal with waste like this and find other markets for it. Homes here are made from hardwood timber from old growth forests and that’s a crime if it ends up in landfill.” Colin Sweet, chief executive of the Australian Landfill Owners Association, which has councils and private industry among its members, said in NSW and Queensland there was a lack of planning to cope with sudden influxes of waste into landfills from disasters. There was no shortage of landfill sites, but there was a shortage of landfill cells – areas prepared to environmental regulations that include linings to prevent leaching – and infrastructure to channel methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, that is generated as waste rots. On the plan to use a quarry, Sweet said: “This is what comes up when we don’t have enough space. Environmental management becomes compromised. “If you just throw it in a quarry there’s no leachate management – it’s like throwing it in the back yard and pretending it’s not there.” In Gympie, one of the first towns to be flooded north of Brisbane, the city council told the Guardian the public tip had seen almost 4,000 drops since last Tuesday – six times the usual rate. A council statement said the amount of waste was unprecedented and while some material could be stored, a majority would go to landfill “and this will unfortunately shorten the life of the current cell, which is in a critical way for space at the moment”. Sodden rubbish could become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and attract vermin, the statement said. Brisbane city council told the Guardian that up to Monday almost 30,000 cubic metres of waste had been collected. Just over half had been taken by residents to resource recovery centres around the city, with the rest being collected from the kerb by council workers, contractors and ADF personnel, who the council said were “working tirelessly to remove items, which are both unsightly and unsafe”. The council could not say how much was still to be collected – 122 food waste bins have been placed in flood-hit suburbs. Georgina Davis, CEO of the Waste and Recycling Industry Association of Queensland, said the number of businesses affected was “unprecedented and well in excess of [the 2011 Brisbane floods]”. She said since 2011 landfill capacity in south-east Queensland had fallen and there was no new capacity being planned. Areas used after the 2011 floods “have since been built on and are no longer accessible”, she said, and a lack of large scale emergency response planning meant “recovery will become more difficult for our communities”. The association’s own members had been hit, with depots and assets flooded and infrastructure damaged. She said waste collected from kerbs was being taken to intermediary facilities so some items like metals from white goods, as well as timber, garden waste and some building materials. In the city’s 2011 floods, about 60% of the waste by weight was recovered. Tony Khoury, executive director of the Waste Contractors and Recyclers Association of NSW, said: “Flood waters carry risks such as water-borne diseases and the key priority is the prompt collection and landfilling of all waste.” He said because most waste was collected in compactor trucks “there is little opportunity for reuse or recycling of flood affected waste”. Last week, the NSW government said people in 17 local government areas would not have to pay the state’s waste levy if they took building materials, furniture and any other flood-generated waste to landfill sites. A NSW government statement said “regional emergency waste storage sites” had been identified in the Northern Rivers region. The quarry site had been inspected by EPA officials and environmental controls would be checked on Thursday, the statement said. Some $210m had been announced to coordinate the clean-up, with fire and rescue personnel and ADF helping residents and businesses, and the government was committed to working with councils and the community. “The sheer volume of waste material makes the recovery of recyclable material challenging,” the statement said. “However, attempts to recover separated materials, such as whitegoods and green waste, may be possible.” In a statement, Queensland environment minister, Meghan Scanlon, said 19 councils had been given $1m each to help the clean-up and 12 waste levy exemptions had been issued for 12 councils. Councils had disaster plans and the state gave advice and support for dealing with waste, she said. “With unprecedented flooding in both large swathes of Queensland and NSW, the issue here isn’t capacity at our landfills, but capacity for council contractors and industry to pick up waste,” she said. Waste sector representatives were being consulted “to determine their processing capabilities to help manage the clean-up,” Scanlon added.",News/Australia news,Qld and NSW floods create mountains of waste and spark environmental and vermin fears,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/qld-and-nsw-floods-create-mountains-of-waste-and-spark-environmental-and-vermin-fears
3/9/2022,"In a simple caravan near the banks of the Tweed River, Peter and Linda Bale sat on the couch in ankle-deep water, trying not to panic. Outside, the streets that criss-cross the sprawling Chinderah caravan parks had become canals, another scene of horror in the New South Wales’ Northern Rivers disaster. “We could just feel it creeping up our legs,” Linda tells the Guardian, fighting back tears. “It was coming up so fast.” For Peter, there was an added complication. His stage four lung cancer, diagnosed as terminal, was making it hard for him to breathe. For two hours, his breathing grew increasingly strained as the floodwaters rose. Their saviour came in an unlikely form. A jetski appeared outside their caravan, ridden by a stranger. It was Api Robin, the husband of comedian Celeste Barber. “I had the cats, both of them in a cat cage and tied them onto the mat on the back of the jetski, and I had one of our little dogs in front of me, squashed in between me and him,” Linda says. “Over the roar of the water and the jetski, all I could hear was [the cats screeching].” On Tuesday, under a stifling sun and blue skies, Linda and Peter returned to survey the damage. Like all visitors to the park, they were greeted by a grim spectacle. Along the road leading into the park, was a wall, seemingly never-ending, of destroyed furniture, waterlogged mattresses, mouldy clothes, and useless white goods. A staggering 180 of the 220 caravans were inundated. More than 300 residents were affected. Even more were destroyed at Chinderah’s other five caravan parks, all located in a two kilometre arc around the riverbank. It is devastation on a confounding scale. Most in these parks did not have much before the floods. Now, most have been left with nothing, save for the clothes on their backs. “It’s just devastating,” Linda says. “You’ve been inside, that’s our life, in those boxes. That’s what’s left.” Very few residents could afford the exorbitant cost of flood insurance in the low-lying caravan parks. The Bales were quoted $10,000 per year, a figure well out of reach, even before the costs associated with Peter’s cancer. Now, residents are left with an invidious choice. Without insurance money, attempting to buy a new home away from the floodplain is not an option for most. But the parks have flooded twice in five years. Many have no option but to stay, attempt to rebuild, and hope, against all global heating predictions, that the next floods don’t come so soon. Heather Emmett has been in the park for six years. Her caravan was ruined in both 2017 and 2022. But when the Guardian encounters her, riding her white bicycle through the park, she is a picture of optimism. “I don’t know what I’m going to be doing. Maybe riding off into the sunset on my bike, with a bottle of wine in my backpack,” she laughs. “We just get ourselves up, shake ourselves off, and start all over again.” Emmett has been staying with her close friend, Debbie Prater, away from the park. Her future remains uncertain. “As soon as it happened, I said ‘I’m out of here, I’m gone’. But I don’t have enough money or equity or anything,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It was insured because I bought it cheap, but it’s not insured enough for the prices that they are now. And there would be so many people who would be in the same boat.” “They have to stay where they are.” Prater is the same. She only bought her caravan 12 months ago, after moving from Armidale to be closer to family. “I can’t afford to go anywhere else, just yet,” she says. She has no flood insurance. “I was a giver, so I never had any money left at all, with my kids and various things,” she said. There is almost universal frustration and puzzlement at the lack of official government response in the parks. Most residents who spoke to the Guardian said they hadn’t seen anyone from the government or the military who had come to help. One resident said she saw a State Emergency Service vehicle drive around the park and then leave. The absence of government services is particularly bewildering, given many across the six caravan parks are in dire need of financial assistance. But, like so many places in the Northern Rivers disaster zone, volunteers have stepped into the breach. A group of volunteers were busy cleaning and drying the Bales’ remaining possessions on Tuesday. They turned up from nowhere and got straight to work. Meanwhile, their friend, Tanya Slaven, was busy scrubbing the walls of mould on Tuesday. Peter’s lung cancer makes cleaning it particularly crucial. Slaven has also set up a GoFundMe to help raise money for the pair, and her uncle and aunt have put up the Bales while they get back on their feet. “It’s hard for them to accept it. But finally they are,” she said. John Anderson, who is helping to manage Tweeds Shores and Chinderah Lakes parks’ disaster response, can barely keep it together when asked about the work of the volunteers. “The response has been … I can’t even talk about it, mate, or I’ll lose it,” he said. He said there is assistance coming from the state government for uninsured residents. But Anderson has a simple message for the nation’s leaders. Something must be done about climate change, or the disaster scenes playing out at the parks will become an inevitable regularity. “I wish they’d start getting real,” he said.",News/Australia news,‘I can’t afford to go anywhere else’: the NSW caravan park residents devastated by floods,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/i-cant-afford-to-go-anywhere-else-the-nsw-caravan-park-residents-devastated-by-floods
3/9/2022,"Years ago, when a young doctor admitted that she had found the previous week very troubling, I readily conceded my own conflict. We were caring for a stressed patient whose children had been separated from her during a marital breakup. She was eager to attend her long-awaited court case because she thought it would clarify the next steps, but the many people involved in her care had many different ideas about what should happen. Her interpreter who also understood the cultural nuances, made almost heroic attempts at advocacy but in the end, the day of court came and went, and the patient’s distress was multiplied by a lack of resolution about the most vital aspect of her life. My abiding memory of that event was that the patient’s refugee status made every step of her hospitalisation harder than it needed to be. Another patient in her place would most likely have walked out and abused us on the way but the refugee patient was diminutive in every sense of the word. Millions are now fleeing Ukraine. Australia has offered humanitarian assistance and the prioritisation of visas to those escaping the conflict. Joining recent arrivals from Iraq, Syria, Myanmar, Sudan, and Afghanistan will be fearful and exhausted people from Ukraine. We might imagine that refugees are relieved to have been spared the depredations of war by arriving in a safe country. They can sleep without the sound of missiles overhead and speak without fear of reprisal. They can breathe clean air, eat a proper meal, and contemplate the next steps to secure their future. They will surely welcome all this, but as a doctor who works with refugees, I also know how awfully hard the “next steps” are for those confronting dispossession and displacement. Many refugees will accept a lesser life for themselves provided their children can thrive. The children of my patients received an interrupted education in their original country followed by learning in name only in refugee camps where the emphasis is on survival. Many have little formal education but are expected to assimilate in a system that sorts students by age, not need. Their parents can be overwhelmed by new practicalities, are often unable to help them, making these children heavily dependent on school services. In the absence of proper funding and specific training, teachers cannot help as fully as they would like, thus setting up an intergenerational pattern of poor outcomes. Still out of this, stars are born, but they have to overcome exceptional challenges. Illness can test the most formidable resolve, but it has a particularly detrimental affect on refugees. Health illiteracy, the lack of a regular doctor, inadequate medical awareness about refugee issues, and limited access to interpreters and culturally sensitive professionals all play a role but most of all, I find my patients swallowed up in the labyrinthine nature of an excellent but complicated healthcare system. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning My patients go from carrying their “medical records” in their head to being ushered into a clinic with computers and official forms. The language and accent go over their head and asking for an interpreter feels like looking a gift horse in the mouth. An occasional patient waits all afternoon while someone marks them as “failed to attend.” This, because they have no idea that getting inside the hospital is just the first step, then they must register their presence and remind the desk that they are still waiting. One of the most heart-wrenching things for me to watch is when refugees, after finding a semblance of normality in a new country, are diagnosed with cancer. Suddenly, this diagnosis upends their life all over again and threatens their tenuous links. It’s one thing for a kindly neighbour to invite a refugee family over for a barbecue but quite another to undertake months of drives to the hospital and getting the kids dressed for school. Thus, my refugee patients with cancer suffer greatly and find themselves nearly as alone as they first arrived. Their needs are simply too great for one inundated social worker, one counsellor, or one doctor, no matter how well intentioned. Governments play an important role in creating policies that not only welcome refugees to a country but also help them integrate with society through sensitive and pragmatic services. Almost all the refugees that I have met want empowerment over sympathy – this honourable task can also be discharged by non-government organisations, charities, advocacy groups, and volunteers. Canada offers one example of how governments can work with individuals to assist resettlement. The Refugee Council in the UK invites volunteers to help several thousand refugees each year, recognising that beyond food and shelter, refugees need crisis advice and mental health support that can be provided in innovative ways. In Australia, the Uniting Church runs the Settlement Hub to help refugees foster self-reliance and community connections, recognising that a safe harbour is just one of their requirements. The preamble to the UN Human Rights Charter evokes saving people from the scourge of war and calls upon us to “reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small”. Many of us watching the horrors unfold in Ukraine want to do more than shake our head at the footage. While we look to governments to lead the way, the capacity to do something to help a fellow human being lies within each one of us. It requires shaking off our complacency and recognising the great privilege of living in this country. Decent people must not lose sight of this.",Opinion/Opinion,As millions flee Ukraine we must help refugees navigate Australia’s labyrinthine health system | Ranjana Srivastava,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/08/as-millions-flee-ukraine-we-must-help-refugees-navigate-australias-labyrinthine-health-system
3/9/2022,"Europe has never felt further away from Australia than it does right now. Even though the borders are open, in the uncertain soup of the pandemic (is this the beginning, middle or end?) international travel still remains a fantasy for many of us. So the next best thing may be to watch a television show about people travelling around Europe – like Us, a four-part series streaming now on ABC’s iView. Released in 2020, and starring Tom Hollander and Saskia Reeves, the BBC One comedy-drama series is based on the book of the same name by David Nicholls, who adapted his own novel for television. The series starts with Connie Petersen (Reeves) sitting up in bed and announcing to her husband, Douglas (Hollander), “I think I want a divorce.” There’s no big reason – just the small things that grind people down over the years and the gloomy thought of time running out. Leave now, and there may be just enough time to start again, reasons Connie: “We’ve been through a lot and we’ve been happy – don’t you think our work is done?” Douglas is taken by surprise (and anger, and sadness – he takes out his emotions by going to the local tip and ripping apart cardboard boxes). In his FitBit and polo shirt, he represents a certain type of middle-aged white man – a man who loves routine, who has woken up to a changing world and feels left behind. He is happy, in a melancholy way – he doesn’t want a divorce. Complicating the stalemate, Douglas and Connie have booked one last family holiday – a big, expensive trip by rail across Europe. This is what hooked me into the series in the first place, the chance to see Europe from the confines of “Fortress Australia”. But instead of being the next best thing to a trip to Europe, Us is a nightmare journey, where the viewer accompanies a married couple and their adult son Albie (Tom Taylor) as their family implodes. Even the happiest family has tense moments while travelling, but in Us, every meal, museum and conversation seems fraught with peril. Will the trip bring them closer together or will it be the nail in the coffin of their relationship? Can Douglas connect with Albie too, or are they condemned to drift politely away from each other (like so many fathers and sons) as the years progress? Before the trip, in an effort to keep Connie, Douglas vows to change – and even draws up a master list of things he can work on. These include being more spontaneous and fun-loving like his artistically inclined wife and son. But is it too late? As we move from the canals of Venice to the coffee houses of Amsterdam, Douglas’s most common refrain is wistful regret. “Maybe we should have been more spontaneous over the years – gone out rather than being too tired or too busy,” he says. Later: “It probably wouldn’t make a difference but I do regret not being more lighthearted.” Even in such picturesque locations, it is painful to watch Douglas trying so hard and being rejected by his family. His son is frequently disgusted and embarrassed by him, and his wife seems to be continuously correcting him. “Douglas,” she just has to say, and across his face flies a flicker of shame and annoyance. Hollander does “Sad Dad” really well. He’s uptight and annoying (I couldn’t stay married to him for a week, let alone decades) but flashbacks to the 1990s when the couple first met, flesh out the attraction between opposites, and what drew this unlikely match together in the first place. Us is a grim postcard from the trenches of middle age and marriage, but it could also be read as a metaphor for Brexit.

3/9/2022,"Sydney residents have pulled out their phones and posted videos on social media as cars floated down flooded streets, bridges were inundated, homes soaked and Manly Dam spilled – threatening hundreds of homes – while torrential rain continued to fall on Australia’s biggest city claiming two lives. The Bureau of Meteorology issued flood warnings while the SES ordered the urgent evacuation of tens and thousands of people in Sydney on Tuesday. The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, called for residents to follow those orders as the national death toll for the flood crisis rose to 21. Driving in many parts of Sydney became unsafe as the deluge hit urban streets and motorways. Sydney’s northern beaches copped much of the torrent, as the main roads in and out were shut off leaving many isolated from the CBD. An evacuation warning was issued for 800 homes and 2,000 people in low-lying areas below Manly Dam as it began to spill on Tuesday afternoon.

3/9/2022,"The global shock brought about by the Russian invasion of Ukraine may have unforeseen consequences for the Australian economy, economists have warned. The EU is racing to cut dependence on Russian gas and oil by as much as 80% this year – just one of the factors pushing crude oil to new decade-highs. Other commodity prices have soared, including wheat to all-time records, propelling the Australian dollar almost as high as 73.5 US cents – its highest in about three months – before paring gains. Australia’s relative dependence among rich nations on commodity exports leaves it exposed to sharp swings in international markets. That reliance aided the nation during the debt-fuelled government spending binge to ensure post-Covid recoveries, and it may assist Australia again in the scramble to find non-Russian sources of commodities from energy to metals to food. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) last weekend warned price shocks would “have an impact worldwide, especially on poor households for whom food and fuel are a higher proportion of expenses”. “Should the conflict escalate, the economic damage would be all the more devastating,” the IMF said. Sanctions on Russia would also “have a substantial impact on the global economy and financial markets, with significant spillovers to other countries”. More costly commodities would be noticed at Australians’ kitchen tables and when they head to the service station – assuming they don’t drive an electric car – with prices predicted to jump to as much as $2.50 a litre for petrol. Chris Richardson, a senior economist at Deloitte, said Australian motorists were “on the wrong side of oil prices that have roughly risen $30 (AU$40) a barrel” since Russia’s invasion last month. Depending on the blend of oil, prices are at their highest in as many as 14 years as investors weigh up the effects of potential sanctions on Russia. The country accounts for 13% of oil exports and 9% of gas, according to Rabobank. Petrol prices are already back up near their recent highs in Melbourne, but are still well off them in other major cities, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said. “With the kind of spot [crude] prices that people have been talking about the last few days, you’d expect to see prices getting up to about $2.50 a litre,” said Graeme Bethune, the chief executive of consultancy EnergyQuest. So far, higher global gas prices have not yet had a big impact locally. “They’ve gone from … $8 to $10 [a gigajoule], not to $50” as in some overseas markets, Bethune said. “So we’ve been fairly insulated so far.” But energy production has little scope to increase in the short term in response to the higher prices, he said. Food prices will be elevated too, not least because Ukraine is one of the world’s biggest exporters of agricultural products. According to Rabobank, Ukraine accounts for 12% of global wheat trade, 16% for corn and 18% for barley. Sanctions on Russia may also affect its exports. Ukraine and Russia together account for 60m tonnes of wheat exports annually, which is more than twice the size of Australia’s record wheat crop last year. Australian farmers’ windfalls will be moderated by higher input costs, such as fertiliser and diesel. Ongoing disruption from large floods over parts of eastern Australia will also curb gains, but at least the La Niña event that has contributed to the heavy rain has peaked, Rabobank said. Catherine Birch, a senior ANZ economist, said recent surveys show consumer and business confidence are affected more by local events than by the war in Ukraine so far. Household inflation expectations are at the highest since 2014, with petrol prices already a key factor, Birch said. New Zealand and the US have seen confidence undermined by higher inflation, and while Australia’s is lower, it’s worth watching. The ongoing flooding in eastern Australia could also boost inflation, not just through high food prices as production and transport chains are strained, but also by adding to higher construction and labour costs. Order books for construction were already bulging before the floods, she said. The group chief economist for NAB, Alan Oster, said Australia’s economy would probably shrug off any near-term effect of the war on consumer or business confidence, and was relatively well placed. “Our labour market is much stronger … US is still 2m jobs below where they started from [pre-Covid],” Oster said. “We still are in the middle of our inflation target, not [double it] as per the US, and wage issues are less.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning NAB on Tuesday brought forward the timing of when they expect the Reserve Bank to start raising the official cash rate to August from a previous forecast of November. “That is purely based on the forecasts we see happening in wages and prices, and much lower unemployment than the RBA expected,” Oster said. “Russia is not relevant other than the effects on uncertainty and may be a reason why the RBA waits longer. “Higher inflation from oil and gas and wheat is from a once-off shock. Most central banks will ignore that.” Oster expects energy importers such as Europe and Japan to be particularly hard-hit, shaving global growth by half a percentage point this year to about 3.7% “provided that [the war] can be solved in the next six months”. One small upside of the economic turmoil may be in federal budget revenue for the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. “Chances are that the federal budget is a net beneficiary simply because of what’s happening around coal and gas prices,” Richardson said. “Australia sells about $80bn a year of coal and gas to the world,” he said. The tax take will rise roughly $2bn for every 10% rise in prices. Iron ore may provide an even bigger fiscal fill-up, with prices lately soaring to six-month highs because of surging Chinese demand. Australia will get “rather more dollars” for the budget than from energy price gains because of the low estimates used by treasury in its earlier forecasts, Richardson said.",News/Business,Fuel and food prices set to rise as Russian invasion affects Australia’s economy,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/09/fuel-and-food-prices-set-to-rise-as-russian-invasion-affects-australias-economy
3/9/2022,"As usual of late, Stephen Colbert checked in on the latest with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “It’s like a nesting doll of bad,” the Late Show host said on Monday evening, after a weekend of indiscriminate shelling that has driven more than 1.5 million Ukrainians to flee the country. That number would be higher if Russia abided by its own announced ceasefires. Over the weekend, Russian forces continued to pummel cities with rockets and mortars despite the announcement of corridors for civilian evacuations. “It’s like Putin’s competing in the evil Olympics against himself,” Colbert noted, “and because he’s Russian, you know he’s juicing.” Putin has since said he would reopen corridors, but only for civilians to flee to Russia. “Well, that’s not helpful,” said Colbert. “That’s like having a safety sign that says ‘in case of fire, jump into a pit of snakes.’” In response to brutal Russian tactics, the US and its European allies have discussed a ban on Russian imports of oil. “Take that, Putin! We’re not going to buy our gas from a war criminal,” Colbert deadpanned. “We’re going to buy it from the good guys: Saudi Arabia.” Such a ban would have a cost, at a time when the average US gas price is at an all-time high of $4.104 a gallon. “OK, that stings, but a clean conscience is worth a buck or two,” said Colbert. “I’m willing to pay $4 a gallon. Hell, I’ll pay $15 a gallon, because I drive a Tesla.” To help support Ukrainian civilians, some Americans have to taken to Etsy to purchase digital items such as fonts, patterns, downloadable photographs and artwork. “So now you can order a lovely, motivational needlepoint pattern that reads ‘Live, Laugh, Russian Warship Go Fuck Yourself’,” Colbert joked. “It’s worth remembering in a moment of international crisis like the one we’re in right now that we came incredibly close to having this criminal dingus in charge of our response,” said Seth Meyers on Monday night over a photo of Donald Trump. “Can you imagine – can you imagine! – what things would be like with Donald Trump at the helm right now? “I mean, put aside everything else – have you heard him talk lately?” the Late Night host continued. “He sounds like he’s muttering to himself while sitting under his favorite tree at the old folks home after getting his morphine drip topped off.” Trump as president during the Russian invasion of Ukraine would be scary for many reasons, Meyers added, “one of which is Trump keeps giving us a glimpse as to how he would have responded. And as usual it has that unique Trump blend of being both terrifying and incredibly stupid at the same time.” In a speech over the weekend to Republican donors in New Orleans, Trump said the US should put the Chinese flag on F-22 jets and “bomb the shit out of Russia” in retribution for its invasion of Ukraine. “He definitely gets his ideas from cartoons,” Meyers responded. “I mean, this is a slightly stupider version of Bugs Bunny dressing up as a sexy lady to distract Elmer Fudd.” He then broke out his Trump impression, saying, “We put the Chinese flag on the planes and if that doesn’t work, we paint a tunnel on the side of a mountain.” Ukrainians continue to brave the Russian invasion with courage, defiance, and, for one guy, stoned fearlessness. pic.twitter.com/yNSD4NRGLb And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah celebrated the Ukrainian resistance to Russian invaders. “It’s been so inspiring to see how they’re still, still telling the Russian invaders to go fuck themselves,” he said before a montage of Ukrainians telling off Russian soldiers, protesting in occupied streets and climbing on top of a Russian tank with the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag. “This really shows you the difference between capturing a city and controlling a city,” said Noah. “You see, capturing a city is easy. You send in more tanks than the other team and then boom, it’s yours. But if you can’t stop the old man in town from coming out and roasting you, have you really won?” Noah zeroed in on one Ukrainian interviewed by a British reporter who “seems to know the secret to not just coping with the possible destruction of your country, but smiling while doing it”. Asked if he was all right by the journalist, the cheerful man said: “I’m alright. I smoke weed. Legalize 420.” “You guys can have [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskiy,” said Noah. “I just found my favorite Ukrainian. “I don’t know about you, but when I smoke weed, I can barely handle the stress of the doorbell ringing,” he added. “This guy is in a war zone getting questioned by a journalist, and he’s chilled AF.”",Arts/Culture,Stephen Colbert: ‘It’s like Putin’s competing in the evil Olympics against himself’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/08/stephen-colbert-putin-russia-ukraine-late-show-recap
