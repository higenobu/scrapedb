3/11/2022,"Wolves ended their run of three successive defeats with a comfortable win over Watford, just as they had done in September, on a night when they equalled their biggest Premier League win to consolidate their place among the chasing pack. Rúben Neves’s sumptuous chip five minutes from time allowed Wolves to match their 4-0 win over Blackpool in 2011 on a night that Ben Foster will probably want to forget as Watford’s good run on the road came to an abrupt halt. The former West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper, who celebrated Watford’s FA Cup semi-final win over these opponents three years ago with a tweet that spelled Wolves with the digits ‘1’ and ‘5’ in memory of the Baggies’ 5-1 win at Molineux in Mick McCarthy’s final game here, was badgered all evening and gave away the ball for Daniel Podence to make it 3-0 in the 21st minute. Only 22 goals had been scored in Premier League matches at Molineux before this one-sided affair which cements Watford’s place in the middle of the bottom three, three points behind 17th place and with three more games played. Raúl Jiménez opened the scoring before Cucho Hernández put past his own keeper but the goal of the night came when Neves, having taken one touch to steady himself on receiving Chiquinho’s header back, advanced into the penalty area as if he was going to blast his shot only to dink it over Foster’s head into the top corner. Watford’s record as defensive misers on the road since Roy Hodgson took over was in tatters inside the first quarter of the game as Wolves refound their attacking swagger. Three goals in an eight-minute burst seemed to have wrapped the game up. Jiménez, recalled to the starting lineup after missing the last two defeats, opened the scoring with a neat right-foot trap and left-foot finish after Hwang Hee-chan burst on to Podence’s touch into the left side of the penalty area to cross short and low to his strike partner. Wolves looked much more dynamic with the Mexican back down the middle and Jonny and Rayan Aït-Nouri advancing down the flanks at every opportunity. When Jonny cut back inside down the right wing and crossed left-footed to his wing-back on the other flank, Aït-Nouri’s pullback was diverted into his own goal by Hernández. Watford had been seeking to equal their top-flight club record of three consecutive clean sheets away from home but their defensive confidence was clearly shattered. Foster, in particular, was getting brickbats from the home fans and when the goalkeeper, under pressure from Jiménez following a bobbling backpass, shanked his attempted clearance, Podence calmly collected the ball 25 yards out and lobbed it into the empty net. The recalled Josh King was promptly sent clear by Moussa Sissoko four minutes later but cleared the crossbar by some distance with his shot from the edge of the penalty area. As the game entered an understandable lull, Bruno Lage, the Wolves manager, turned to the stands, raising his arms and then holding up three fingers, exhorting the crowd to help keep up the intensity. Perhaps the Molineux faithful were in shock; this was the first time since April 2019 that they had led 3-0 at half-time. Watford’s sense of woe was exacerbated as they lost Kiko Femenía and King to injuries, forcing Hodgson to use up two substitutes before the start of the second half, with Christian Kabasele coming on at right-back and Samuel Kalu up front. The second half turned into something of a pantomime. Lage was quicker to respond to the South Bank’s calls for a wave than Foster who sent another miskick to Podence, this time 60 yards out. The Wolves’ No 10 still went for the lob from the centre circle, Foster back-pedalling in time to take the catch. Wolves took the opportunity to introduce younger legs as Pedro Neto, fresh from signing a new five-year contract on his 22nd birthday on Wednesday, and Fábio Silva came on. Neto rose high to head Jonny’s cross goalwards, but Foster saved, then Silva was unlucky to nick Aït-Nouri’s left-wing cross wide of the far post. But Wolves, surely, had done enough.",Sport/Football,Raúl Jiménez leads Wolves’ rout of sloppy Watford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/10/wolves-watford-premier-league-match-report
3/11/2022,"Rangers have taken a big step towards their first European quarter-final for 16 years. James Tavernier and Alfredo Morelos struck in a hurly-burly first half before Leon Balogun headed into the net at the start of the second to give the Scottish champions a plump cushion to take with them for next week’s second leg in Belgrade. Two weeks after one of the most glorious European results in Rangers’ history, Giovanni van Bronckhorst sent out the same XI that finished the victorious tie against Borussia Dortmund but he had them aligned in a different formation, with a back four rather than a 3-5-2. Red Star started brightly but the 50,000 excited souls in Ibrox rejoiced when Rangers’ first proper attack yielded a penalty, Ryan Kent skittering into the box and falling over Slavoljub Srnic’s trailing leg. Tavernier curled an unstoppable spot-kick into the top corner. Aleksandar Katai thought he had equalised almost immediately but, for the second time in a frenetic start, his effort was ruled out for offside. Red Star barely had a chance to curse their poor timing before Rangers inflicted further pain. Ryan Jack received a short corner at the edge of the box before crossing towards the far post; a defensive header sent it bouncing towards Morelos, who dispatched a sweetly controlled shot into the net from eight yards. Jack’s fortunes then turned for the worse in a breathless contest, as he was penalised for a foul in his own box. But Katai’s luck did not change: Allan McGregor clawed away his penalty with a brilliant one-handed save. The visitors were slick and muscular but Rangers nearly made it 3-0 before the break, Glen Kamara firing over the bar after superb work by Jack and Calvin Bassey. Five minutes into the second half, Rangers broke through again, Balogun leapt to head an outswinging corner by Tavernier beyond the goalkeeper from 10 yards. Connor Goldson nearly made it 4-0 from another corner but Aleksandar Dragovic cleared off the line. Red Star remained dangerous. McGregor was finally beaten in the 73rd minute but Guélor Kanga’s ferocious shot from 25 yards clattered the bar.",Sport/Football,Leon Balogun caps rampant Rangers’ first-leg triumph over Red Star Belgrade,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/10/rangers-red-star-belgrade-europa-league-match-report
3/11/2022,"My Brilliant Friend (Sky Atlantic) is the most beautiful drama on television, and, considering how consistently excellent it has been, it remains sorely underrated. This third season adapts the third of Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels, Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay, and, for those who luxuriated in its first two seasons, it remains as gorgeous and seductive as ever. Lifelong friends and rivals Lila and Elena, or Lenù, are now in their 20s, and their lives have moved away from the poor Naples neighbourhood where they grew up together. The first episode is about Lenù, the one who left, and her rise to fame as a successful writer of what is rumoured to be a racy novel. Success brings her a new life among professors and student activists, where opinions are discussed over expensive dinners and there is no obligation for her to marry her fiance, Pietro, a non-believer, in a church. She has been educated out of her class and traditions, but family ties remain, and much of the first episode concerns how difficult this is for her. At home in Naples, she is called “superior” and told she has ideas above her station. Every single scene between Lenù and her mother is a mesmerising battle between cruelty and love. In Milan, she must watch on as young academic men are lauded for their brilliance. Lenù is trying to prove that she is a new person, at the same time as trying to work out what it is she wants to say, now that she has a voice with which to say it. My Brilliant Friend effortlessly balances impossible questions about love, family, shame and duty, and it does so with impeccable style. This series is set in the early 70s and it really is a good-looking drama, cinematic in its ambitions, again taking its visual cues from a particular period of film history (this season’s director, Daniele Luchetti, has said he was inspired by John Cassavetes and 70s US cinema). Even a short scene of Lenù in a bookshop looks stunning, as does Lila walking across a factory floor, surrounded by strung-up animal carcasses. It is clever to keep Lila out of the first episode, because it makes it more powerful when she comes back into the story in the second. Lila is the one who stayed, in Naples at least, though she remains estranged from her family, and works in a meat factory to support herself and her young son. Lila’s brilliance remains fierce, though her situation is arduous, and she is picked up as a symbol of working-class women and their struggle by the communists in her orbit. Some of the boys from the old neighbourhood are now fascists. Political struggle is everywhere, and the heat of it is rising. It is both a curious and strangely effective choice to continue with the actors who played Lila and Lenù as teenagers, even as they age into a more adult world and different lives. Gaia Girace (Lila) and Margherita Mazzucco (Lenù), who have been remarkable so far, are 18 and 19, and they look it. While they are dressed up to appear just a little older, with makeup and wigs, their obvious youth gives the effect of young women adrift in the world, and sometimes they look like children playing at adulthood. It shouldn’t work as well as it does, but it does – adding to the notion that they are searching for something, even if they don’t quite know what it is yet. This is television at its best and it weaves a spell unlike anything I have seen in a very long time. It demands concentration but rewards it generously. For those who have yet to experience the pleasure of My Brilliant Friend, I would suggest not jumping in here, as both personal and political histories weigh heavily on the characters and their relationships. Go back to the beginning, and take it all in.",Arts/Television & radio,My Brilliant Friend review – this gorgeous drama is television at its best ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/10/my-brilliant-friend-review-this-gorgeous-drama-is-television-at-its-best
3/11/2022,"Perhaps it was inevitable given how the half-time playlist gleefully segued between Dirty Cash (Money Talks), Price Tag and Can’t Buy Me Love that a divine second-half intervention from Newcastle’s marquee January signing, Bruno Guimarães, would earn a sixth win in seven matches and extend Eddie Howe’s unbeaten streak to nine Premier League games. Chris Wood, another mid-season recruit, scored his first goal for the club to cancel out Southampton’s first-half opener before Guimarães’s touch of class sealed a victory that lifts Newcastle 10 points above the relegation zone and within four of the top half. It was hard to begrudge the sold-out away end enjoying the moment, even if some of the songs felt delightfully far-fetched. For Ralph Hasenhüttl, whose Southampton side have lost successive games for the first time since November, defeat would have only rammed home his frustration. Hasenhüttl had aired a few gripes – or what could be perceived as sour grapes – about Newcastle being able to name a “completely different team” compared to the one Southampton would have faced at the end of December and argued new signings should have been ineligible for this rearranged game, the original fixture postponed owing to Covid and injuries. Four of Newcastle’s January recruits started here, including Guimarães, who had been drip-fed minutes off the bench since his £40m arrival from Lyon. He replaced the injured Joelinton in their three-man midfield and a fifth, Kieran Trippier, again travelled to the game with the squad despite being on crutches after fracturing a foot. Allan Saint-Maximin missed the game through illness. Newcastle’s travelling 3,300-strong support enjoyed Dan Burn’s early challenge on Armando Broja, but it was Southampton who shaded the opening stages. Martin Dubravka did well to claw the ball from Broja after the on-loan Chelsea striker latched on to a fine Oriol Romeu pass and Broja later skewed wide after Romeu edged out Jonjo Shelvey on halfway. But the hosts’ pressure told when they opened the scoring through Stuart Armstrong after 25 minutes, though the ball took an age to drop into the net. Mohamed Elyounoussi diverted Kyle Walker-Peters’s cross back across goal and Armstrong nodded in, via Burn, who tried in vain to clear. Southampton’s lead proved short-lived. Shelvey played a laser pass into the box for Wood and the striker easily eluded Mohammed Salisu to power a header into the bottom corner beyond Fraser Forster, the goalkeeper who started his career with Newcastle. Joe Willock could have headed Newcastle in front before the interval but failed to hit the target after meeting Guimarães’s cross. Southampton came much closer to regaining the lead, Adams blasting against the crossbar after the leftovers of Armstrong’s attempted shot fell to him inside the box. Newcastle’s players emerged for the second half to the backdrop of Money, Money, Money and Guimarães, who had a low-key opening 45 minutes, soon displayed the kind of skill that convinced Amanda Staveley and Jamie Reuben, among the Newcastle contingent watching in the directors’ box, to sign him. Jacob Murphy had a fierce shot diverted wide and, from the subsequent corner, Burn knocked the ball down into the six-yard box. Guimarães, with his back to goal, effortlessly flicked the ball in with his right boot to spark delirium among the travelling supporters. The smell of a smoke bomb filled the St Mary’s air and Guimarães, who later departed to a standing ovation from the away fans, soaked up the adulation, pointing to the name on the back of his shirt. But Newcastle were not finished there and went for the jugular, Salisu blocking a powerful shot by the former Southampton defender Matt Targett. Southampton fell flat but Dubravka had to be alert to divert a troubling Tino Livramento cross that swirled goalwards and, with a minute of normal time to play, the Newcastle goalkeeper managed to push a dangerous Salisu header away. There were a hairy couple of moments for Newcastle in six added minutes but the visitors held on.",Sport/Football,Bruno Guimarães downs Southampton as Newcastle surge continues,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/10/southampton-newcastle-premier-league-match-report
3/11/2022," If nothing else, this one will make for some stunning photographs. The deep blue of France against the bright scarlet of Wales, the Friday night lights of Cardiff offering a richness to the images. That is about as much optimism as can be confidently projected from a Welsh point of view as a French side set on a grand slam meet a squad seemingly held together by chewing gum and gumption. “They’re the real deal,” said the Wales captain and fly-half, Dan Biggar, on the eve of the match. “We realise that this French team is different to the previous French teams that we’ve played over the years. The size of the pack, the in-form players that they’ve got, the coaching setup and who they’ve brought in.” Much of the attention has rightly focused on Antoine Dupont, World Rugby’s reigning player of the year and the fulcrum at No 9 between a blistering backline and a set of forwards that might be the most dominant in the game at present. “It’s pretty obvious he’s the best player in the world,” Biggar said of Dupont. “He has a huge influence on any game he plays. His partnership with [Romain] Ntamack has flourished over the past 18 months. They’re in seriously good form.” This will be the half-back pairing’s 12th Six Nations game together. According to the statistician Russ Petty they are only three away from Morgan Parra and François Trinh-Duc. But at 25 and 22 respectively, Dupont and Ntamack are on the brink of what could be a dynastic union. That they are mostly playing front-foot ball has several explanations. For a side famed for their expansive running and offload game, France kick a lot. They have made almost 800 more metres from the boot than any other team in the competition and therefore rarely play in their own half. They pin the opposition back three in their own territory and invite counterattacks from distance. They then commit to the breakdown like zealots, jackalling with ferocious intent until they either win a penalty or turn the ball over. Then there’s their monstrous pack. “Look at the way they dismantled Scotland,” Biggar said of France’s 36-17 win in Edinburgh. “A lot of it was due to big carries, getting on top of the ball or being on top defensively and scoring points from that. It’s about making sure we’re physically ready and then we’ve got to make sure we take our opportunities because they’ll probably be few and far between. France aren’t going to give us anything on a plate. We have to earn what we get.” France have not stumbled upon their extra heft overnight, it has been building. At the 2018 Under-20 World Championship final, France bulldozed England to win 33-25. An indomitable scrum and a clinical lineout proved the difference in Béziers. Ntamack played that day, but more crucially so did Julien Marchand and Cameron Woki who will both start in France’s tight five on Friday with Jean-Baptiste Gros offering support from the bench. Biggar, though, did offer one other source of hope. He cited the 2013 game in Paris. Not much was expected of Wales having just lost eight games in a row. But a scrappy 16-6 win kickstarted their campaign, which would end in triumph five weeks later. “We’re quietly confident,” said Biggar, who has been productive against France, scoring three tries from 11 games, winning seven of them. “We’re happy for Dupont and Ntamack and Shaun [Edwards, France’s defence coach who had previously fulfilled the role with Wales] to take all the headlines. We’re just trying to make sure we focus on ourselves.”",Sport/Sport,Wales’s Dan Biggar braced for stern Six Nations test from ‘real deal’ France,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/10/six-nations-france-team-are-the-real-deal-says-wales-captain-dan-biggar
3/11/2022,"Eddie Jones cannot even pop out to a cafe without being told his side must raise their game considerably to beat Ireland. When his local barista, as allegedly happened this week, starts expressing doubts about England finishing the Six Nations with a flourish, it is small wonder Jones is labelling Ireland as “red-hot favourites” before Saturday’s showdown at Twickenham. Even allowing for a whiff of artistic licence, Jones’s account of the conversation will certainly raise a wry smile across the Irish Sea. “The girl says: ‘That Irish team must be good. All their ex-players think they’re going to win and all the ex-England players think they’re going to win. They must be pretty good. How you feeling?’ I said: ‘Just give me the coffee please.’” Boom boom. If England wish to avoid their 2022 championship campaign ending bitterly they will need to wake up and smell whatever it takes to elevate them to the next level. The good news is that the match-day squad to face Ireland includes all the players who have been slightly doubtful this week, with the influential Tom Curry having passed his return-to-play protocols. Kyle Sinckler has also been named in the starting lineup despite a back problem while Alex Dombrandt is on the bench having convinced the management he has recovered fully from a touch of Covid. If Jones did not sound 100% confident about Sinckler – “We think he is going to be right” – he was in no doubt about the key areas and vital personnel if England are to gain revenge for their 32-18 defeat in Dublin 12 months ago. With Sam Simmonds at No 8 and Joe Marchant at No 13 there are just four starting survivors from that encounter, and Jones wants his reshuffled side to concentrate on shutting down Ireland’s strengths. “Whenever you play Ireland the breakdown is a significant part of the game,” stressed Jones. “They pride themselves on that area, but we are a very physical team and they haven’t played against a side as physical as us for a long time. If you look at their record, they haven’t played against South Africa since 2017. We played against South Africa last year and did well in those physical stakes so we intend to really take it to them.” With Marchant preferred to Elliot Daly for his aerial prowess and slightly more direct approach, England are also hoping the long-awaited return of Joe Launchbury to a match-day squad will help stiffen their maul late in the second half and further inconvenience a settled, cohesive Irish side. “We have one intention in this game and that’s to go after Ireland,” said Jones, reaching for a now-familiar metaphor. “We are going to chase them hard down the street. Everywhere they go, we’re going to be in their faces and we’re going to take time and space away from them. Do we enjoy that challenge? Yes.” It is also worth mentioning that, for all Ireland’s strengths and impressive record of 10 wins in their previous 11 Tests, England have won their last three home games against each of Australia, South Africa and Wales. Jones remains adamant that a spectacular attacking display is brewing and will soon materialise. “It’s like a wave coming in. You can see it coming in and all of a sudden it crashes and all this power comes out of it. That’s what we’ll be like.

3/11/2022,"A national tutoring programme is failing to help the children who need it most, according to MPs, who say ministers should terminate their contract with the consultancy firm running the scheme unlessit “shapes up”. A report by the education select committee gives a scathing account of the government’s £5bn national tutoring programme (NTP), which aims to help children in England catch up on learning missed during the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021. The MPs criticised the “spaghetti junction of funding” that makes it difficult for schools to support tutoring programmes. But they reserved their sternest criticism for Randstad, the Dutch multinational service provider given a contract to administer the scheme by the Department for Education (DfE) last year. The committee says it has “huge concerns” over Randstad’s ability to meet the targets it was set. The NTP is said to have reached just 15% of its overall target so far. “The NTP is missing its overall target to deliver tuition to 2 million children. When Randstad appeared before us, they were unable to provide us with figures setting out who was accessing the NTP,” the committee said. “If the NTP is not meeting its targets, the [DfE] should terminate its contract with Randstad.” MPs said the £5bn funding was not being spent wisely. “By not providing support for those most in need, the government risks baking in deepening inequalities between disadvantaged children and their better-off peers.” Earlier this month, Schools Week reported that Randstad had removed a requirement to reach 65% of disadvantaged children from its contracts with tutoring providers. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the education committee, said: “The government must ensure Randstad shapes up, or boot them out. The catch-up programme must be shown to be reaching disadvantaged pupils and this data must be published.” The DfE said new statistics about the NTP’s operation would be published on Friday. Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said the poor design of the NTP meant ministers were “pouring taxpayers’ money down the drain”. “Our children have been an afterthought for the Tories throughout the pandemic and are now being neglected in our recovery,” Phillipson said. Anne Longfield, the former children’s commissioner, said the report showed the government’s response had been “haphazard, unambitious and mired in bureaucracy”, with deprived and vulnerable children at risk of being left further behind. “It is time to deliver what was promised after schools reopened post-lockdown and make children’s recovery the priority it should be. That should include being prepared to dismiss those who are being paid millions to run a catch-up plan, if that plan is not doing its job,” Longfield said. Natalie Perera, the chief executive of the Education Policy Institute, said: “The scope and ambition of the government’s wider £5bn catch-up programme continues to fall short of what the evidence tells us is needed. Our research has shown that an education recovery package of £13.5bn is required to support pupils in England.” A DfE spokesperson said: “We continue to work with Randstad to ensure as many children from all backgrounds – in particular those from disadvantaged backgrounds – across the country can benefit from high-quality tutoring and catch up on lost learning.” Karen Guthrie, Ranstad’s senior programme director for the NTP, said she was “encouraged to see an increase in the number of packages delivered”. “We are working closely with schools across the country who are best placed to select pupils that need tuition the most. We have been working in partnership with the DfE, schools and tuition partners to look at how we can improve the programme moving forward to best serve the needs of schools,” Guthrie said.",News/Education,"National tutoring scheme failing disadvantaged pupils, say MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/10/national-tutoring-scheme-failing-disadvantaged-pupils-say-mps
3/11/2022,"Freeze our assets. Curtail our hotel allowance. Link our 19 years of unbroken success to the enabling of a blood-stained dictator. It seems the show really does go on. For now anyway, as on a crisp, clear Norfolk evening the players of Chelsea dished up an entertaining Premier League defeat of a game and energetic Norwich. Welcome to Chelsea, the afterlife. A place that felt, as the Norwich fans sang about dirty Russian money, as the Chelsea fans serenaded their yacht-bound owner, like another lurch into the deeply strange parallel timeline of football and geopolitics in the year 2022. News of the sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich had emerged shortly after 9am on Thursdayyesterday morning. By lunchtime the canal-side boulevards of Norwich’s pedestrianised city centre were thronged with Chelsea supporters singing the afternoon away. “We’ve got Tommy Tuchel: he knows just what to do.” Does he though? And if so, could he share it with the rest of us? Because nothing right now makes a great deal of sense. Later on, as the Chelsea fans kept up an early wave of noise close to kick off there was a valedictory, Viking funeral-style air about their boisterous good spirits, a sense of good cheer, of event-glamour about all this. Humans are odd creatures. Give us a tribe, a hill to die on: any hill, and often that’s enough. It would be convention at this point to state that this was a game Chelsea needed to win to maintain their stroll towards next season’s Champions League and another step into the unblemished future. Although right now all of this must come asterisked with uncertainty and hypothesis. Tuchel had picked an everyday Chelsea team for this most otherworldly of occasions, rotating some key parts but retaining the first-choice forward line that has Kai Havertz settled as the focal point. Tuchel could be excused feeling a little demob-unhappy. One thing does seem certain: Chelsea finally have a manager they can’t, under current UK law, actually sack. Otherwise it was business as usual. With one minute gone at Carrow Road, Chelsea’s fans were singing “Roman Abramovich”. With two minutes gone they were singing “We’ve won it all”, greeted by chants of “You’ve lost it all” from the Norwich fans. With three minutes gone they were 1-0 up, Trevoh Chalobah heading in Mason Mount’s corner. Say what you like about the oligarchical system of Vladimir Putin’s Russia: it has helped create a very effective football team. With 14 minutes gone Mount made it 2-0, teed up by Havertz who looked, as he has done lately, a whirl of ceaseless movement and sharp edges close to goal. And as the game drifted on there was time to reflect on one of the strangest days in English football history. It isn’t just the fact that the most successful Premier League club of the past two decades have become, at a stroke, a distressed asset. It is also the way the uneasy reality of the last 19 years, the reality of that unceasing Stamford Bridge buffet, has been stripped away. There are two points worth making about all this. First, the government’s decision to sanction seven Russian oligarchs has little to do with Chelsea. What is or isn’t fair for football fans makes up a tiny portion of this picture. Unrecoverable hotel costs? Northing to do on Saturday? Tell it to the besieged civilians of Ukraine. And second, Chelsea are, for the time being, absolutely cooked. The club can’t generate income, can’t manage the payroll, can’t sell any tickets (those stacks of unsold tickets have now become non-fungible tokens, to be traded for curiosity value, like a stopped watch from the deck of the Titanic). The players were getting on a plane at Gatwick on Thursday morning when news broke that this thing, this endlessly giving hand, had been chopped off at the knees by the British government. How many are already checking the precise location of the ejector seat button? How many calls had been made by lunchtime to Reece James’s agent ? More pressing, how will Chelsea’s players make that £20,000 away day allowance stretch after this final Norfolk blow-out? Get the room service in while you can, lads. Dismantle the trouser press. For tomorrow we’re in the serviced apart-hotels. There is at least something brilliantly prescient about Chelsea’s choice of Liquidator as the pre-match walk out music at Stamford Bridge through the Abramovich years. It has to be said, Chelsea’s players were undaunted, unscrambled and hungrily engaged with the task in hand, even if they were made to hold on for the last 10 minutes as Norwich pushed hard after pulling one back though Teemu Pukki’s penalty. Havertz’s late third killed the game. And Chelsea, for now, roll on.",Sport/Football,Kai Havertz sparkles against Norwich but Chelsea’s uneasy reality is laid bare,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/10/norwich-chelsea-premier-league-match-report
3/11/2022,"The third day in Antigua was one that England’s bowlers will be keen to wipe from their memory banks but one that Nkrumah Bonner will never forget as his second Test century ground West Indies into a position of strength. Over the course of nine hours Bonner repelled all that Joe Root’s attack threw at him only to perish just before the close. It took the loopy, wrong-footed off-spin of Dan Lawrence to prise him out, a tickle down leg given out on review, but with 125 from 355 balls he had steered the host to 373 for nine and a lead of 62. “It means a lot for me,” said Bonner at stumps. “Looking back at my stats before this series I had not scored major runs in the Caribbean, so am very happy I stepped forward. It’s a good venue, a good pitch to bat on. Tomorrow we want to bat for an hour, get a 100-run lead to put pressure on the English batsmen.” At 157 overs this is already the longest innings England have spent in the field during what continues to be a winter of discontent. Though the draw looks likeliest, it could have a telling impact on the fate of the series too after an elbow injury to Mark Wood that Joe Root a bowler light for the bulk of the proceedings and put significant miles into the legs of others. The one Englishman to enhance his reputation in Australia, Wood was absent when West Indies resumed on 202 for four first thing, eventually emerging with a white tubigrip and strapping on his bowling arm. He seemed fine during an initial four-over burst but shortly after the second new ball he sent down six more deliveries that were down on pace and forced his exit. Stokes was initially slated for a reduced role with the ball on his comeback from a side strain but picked up the slack, chalking up 28 overs of grunt work; he claimed his second wicket early on too, winning the battle of the all-rounders when Jason Holder was caught in two minds whether to defend or leave an outswinger and feathered behind on 45. It was the solitary strike of the morning and on a pitch that nodded off like some of the supporters on the grass banks, Bonner delivered a near-perfect display of gimlet-eyed crease occupation. He didn’t just trust his defence but, once a two-hour stand of 73 with wicketkeeper Joshua da Silva had been broken by Jack Leach, those supposedly less capable down the order. Only Alzarri Joseph failed to repay it at No 8, out for two attempting to hook Craig Overton amid an easily telegraphed bumper plan. The more experienced Kemar Roach was not nearly so wasteful, however, wearing blows to the hand and body during an 89-ball 15 and driving Joe Root for four to take West Indies into the lead on the stroke of tea. And even once Roach and Bonner had been separated, the No 9 run out by a fine throw from the deep by substitute Ollie Pope, in came Veerasammy Permaul to offer 87 balls of resistance for an unbeaten 26. Both had taken their lead from Bonner, an orthodox right-hander who moments after tea had swept Leach for four to move to a hard-earned century from 257 deliveries. The persistence on show tallied with his story overall, Bonner having played a couple of forgettable Twenty20 internationals more than a decade ago and then almost given up on a professional career back in 2018 when runs proved so elusive while playing for the Leeward Islands. He briefly moved to Houston, Texas, to work in construction before deciding to return to his native island of Jamaica for one last crack. And something clicked, Bonner forcing his way onto the tour of England in 2020 with two centuries and an average of 58 in the regional four-day competition that preceded it. Scores of 86 and 90 during his debut series in Bangladesh 12 months ago were then followed by a maiden Test century on this ground; Bonner’s first-class average of 28.8 coming into this series was therefore deceptive. The same cannot be said of England’s bowling, even if mitigation came from Wood’s absence and a surface that has made for an increasingly hard watch ever since its early moisture on day one evaporated. Both Chris Woakes and Overton certainly put in a shift for Root with 30 and 32 overs respectively, the former at least clawing back his economy even if that much discussed overseas bowling average continues to head north. Instead it was Leach who offered what little threat was out there, the left-armer unfortunate not to grab a second wicket of the innings when Bonner was on 73 and an inside edge off pad was grassed Zak Crawley at slip. With conditions against this attack, it was a chance that simply had to be taken.",Sport/Sport,Nkrumah Bonner defies England to put West Indies in driving seat,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/10/nkrumah-bonner-defies-england-to-put-west-indies-in-driving-seat
3/11/2022,"If you are a Leeds supporter of the superstitious nature, you may be wise to look away now. For the first time in almost 20 years, Leeds have fallen to six consecutive league defeats: the latest of which was a chastening watch for Jesse Marsch on his first night inside Elland Road. The last time that happened? The 2003-04 season that ended in relegation from the Premier League. It is a fact Leeds supporters will be keen to ignore, but just like 18 years ago the reality is that this side are now firmly in a battle to preserve their top-flight status. It was a night that started with Marsch being serenaded by the Leeds faithful but ended with chants for his predecessor, Marcelo Bielsa, and frustrations aired towards the directors’ box after the hosts capitulated spectacularly in the second half. Their season is unravelling rapidly but credit must go to Aston Villa, who led at half-time courtesy of Philippe Coutinho’s strike. They withstood Leeds’s surge after the interval, surviving several half-chances before putting them to the sword in clinical fashion. First, Matty Cash doubled their lead before Calum Chambers’s wonderful strike. It was no less than a Villa side who continue to evolve offensively under Steven Gerrard deserve, with the attacking triumvirate of Coutinho, Danny Ings and Ollie Watkins again impressive. Marsch was given a rapturous welcome to West Yorkshire, with that noise only matched by the chants aimed in the direction of Tyrone Mings every time he touched the ball in the early stages. Mings looked nervy, with a couple of hooked clearances, but as the half wore on he and the visitors began to settle into the game. The England international had the first real chance with his effort blocked after a Villa set piece. As the midway point in the half approached, it felt somewhat inevitable when the visitors went ahead. Leeds looked most fragile down their right and after Lucas Digne snuck in behind Stuart Dallas to provide a cross that narrowly evaded Watkins, Villa kept the ball alive long enough for Cash’s ball back into the area to find Coutinho. The Brazilian’s effort appeared to be going harmlessly towards Illan Meslier, but a deflection from Pascal Struijk helped it loop past the helpless keeper and put Villa ahead. If anything, the cacophony of noise inside Elland Road seemed to be affecting the Leeds players more, best underlined when Meslier miscued a clearance into the path of Watkins. Had the forward’s touch been crisper he would have been clear in on goal with the keeper way out of position, but Leeds and Meslier escaped. There was precious little at the opposite end for Leeds fans to be heartened by so it was no surprise they began to chant Patrick Bamford’s name with half-time approaching despite the striker not even emerging for a warm-up. It was clear Leeds were lacking potency in attack and they almost fell further behind when Meslier had to tip a curling effort from John McGinn wide on the stroke of the break. Marsch’s response was to call for a striker at half-time. It was not Bamford but Joe Gelhardt who was given the challenge of sparking Leeds’s attack into life. Within seconds of the restart, they came close when Raphinha’s ball across goal was narrowly missed by Dan James. The moment Leeds fans had yearned for arrived on the hour mark as Bamford returned for the first time since December. But just as he was adjusting to the rhythm of the game, Villa struck a devastating counter-punch to double their lead. Ings’s switch found Cash unmarked at the back post and he had the wherewithal to cut inside past a helpless Junior Firpo and fire past Meslier to make it 2-0. It completely stunted the momentum Leeds had built since half-time, as well as the atmosphere inside Elland Road. Things would only get worse for the hosts. After they failed to clear their lines Chambers profited when he bent a superb strike past Meslier. That prompted widespread chanting of Bielsa’s name, with fans in the main stand turning their anger on the home directors. A miserable night was then compounded when Firpo was taken off on a stretcher in the final minutes, meaning Leeds had to finish with 10 men. In truth, it mattered little: this result had long since been decided.",Sport/Football,Aston Villa’s Calum Chambers delivers hammer blow to flailing Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/10/leeds-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report
3/11/2022,"Thousands more people could soon be living on an extensive flood plain on the fringes of Sydney if land already approved for development were to proceed, according to planning officials, councillors and the New South Wales government’s own data. Blacktown city council alone has more than 10,000 homes already planned, with that region’s population expected to swell by half to more than 600,000 over the next two decades . Thousands of hectares lie in the Hawkesbury-Nepean flood plain, and while the NSW government is pausing new developments while it revises its flood strategy, pressure to open up more land for housing isn’t expected to recede. That is despite two east coast lows in a week swelling the river to its highest levels in some places since 1978. Hundreds of homes are likely to have been inundated, renewing worries many more people will be placed in harm’s way if developments proceed based on historic flood data that doesn’t account for climate change. Rob Stokes, NSW’s infrastructure and a former planning minister, said the latest flooding reinforced the need to take a precautionary approach towards flood plain developments, including tackling the legacy of past decisions. “We had some real concerns,” said Stokes, who intervened in late 2020 to halt development in part of the flood plains and gave regional councils more discretion to limit new projects in 2021. “After an event like this past week, we have to be open to having another look at what’s been approved for development.” According to the 2021 environmental impact study on the plan to raise the height of the upstream Warragamba Dam, a flood with a 1% chance of occurring in any one year – usually dubbed a “one-in-100-flood” – would affect 7,600 homes. A probable maximum flood, or worst-case scenario, would affect 36,700 homes, the study said, citing 2018 data. Changes introduced by the previous Labor government in 2006 with its Resilient Valley Resilient Communities Flood Risk plan had opened the way for developments to proceed within the current one-in-100 year flood zone, said officials who spoke to Guardian Australia but requested anonymity because they were not authorised to comment publicly. The key areas to be developed are Penrith Lakes, Riverstone North, Marsden Park and West Schofields. One obstacle has been the lack of insurance given the spate of recent floods as well as the historical record. However, the multibillion-dollar plan to lift the Warragamba Dam by as much as 14 metres, would serve as a green light for such developments. “If the dam wall’s raised, I’d put down very good money that these projects will rapidly progress,” one official said. “There’s been a lot of paperwork done, followed by waiting.” One local government agreed thousands of homes that may be exposed to flood risks could be built: “The planning legacy dates back to Labor but this present government is pressing on with it.” Greens MP David Shoebridge said the government’s own data indicates developers have their sights on building within the flood zone. “There are over 40,000 hectares of flood-prone land just in the Hawkesbury-Nepean basin, much of it already slated for more housing, and if we let that happen we are turbocharging future disasters,” Shoebridge said. “Just like the flood waters, money will find its way.” Hawkesbury city council’s area alone has 23,900 hectares of the flood-prone land, with 11,500ha in Penrith, 4,700ha in Blacktown and 4,500ha in the Hills shire. “The very first thing that the NSW government needs to do to protect homeowners from floods is stop allowing new homes to be developed on known flood plains,” Shoebridge said. “The planning minister could issue a state planning policy tomorrow and put a moratorium on new flood plain residential development, but developers hold so much power over state governments that they won’t even discuss it.” A Blacktown city council spokesperson said the NSW government mandates the location and extent of planned development, which the council was required to follow. “New dwellings must be at the 1:100 year flood level, plus an additional 500mm of elevation,” the spokesperson said, citing the Flood Plain Development Manual. For Blacktown’s Marsden Park North, there were 6,224 dwellings proposed, while in West Schofields there are were another 4,494. “The progress and completion of the rezoning of these precincts has been delayed by the Department of Planning and Environment, pending the outcome of the NSW government’s flood evacuation strategy,” the spokesperson said. A Department of Planning and Environment spokesperson said rezonings led by the NSW government had been paused after the March 2021 floods in Sydney’s northwest while a new flood strategy was being prepared. “This pause is still in place today,” the spokesperson said. Stuart Ayres, the minister for western Sydney, said raising the dam wall would reduce the flood risk for the 140,000 people who currently work or live in the Hawkesbury-Nepean, without saying how many more are planned for the area. “The NSW government continues to carefully considering all development in the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley in light of the flood risk, which is why integrated land use, road and emergency planning is a key action under the flood strategy.” Ayres said. “The upgrade of evacuation routes is another key action being delivered under the flood strategy.” “Raising Warragamba Dam has never been about development, it’s always been about protecting people and property who live in higher risk flood areas,” he said. Mary Lyons-Buckett, a Hawkesbury councillor and former mayor, said important information had been withheld from the public, including on regional land-use planning, impacts of cumulative overland flooding and the potential for longer periods of downstream inundation caused by post-floods dam releases. “I do not believe we can sustain any more development in the flood plain,” Lyons-Buckett said. “We need to seriously consider the future of those already living there – we need flood proof evacuation routes, as we know the only true way of ensuring safety is to get people out of harm’s way.” The Hawkesbury mayor, Patrick Conolly, said his council had halted new developments within the flood plain. His concern, though, was the plan for neighbouring councils such as Penrith and the Hills to increase their populations by many thousands, potentially jamming up evacuation routes. Conolly supported the dam wall raising, however, arguing it was needed to protect existing homes. “We’ve got 12,000 houses under the one-in-100 year flood level because they’ve been here for decades,” he said. “And we have to protect them. “So in the end, the answer can’t just be stop developing, or buy them all back, because neither of those things is practical. “It doesn’t solve the problem we’ve already got.”",News/Australia news,Thousands more to live on floodplain on Sydney’s fringes if developments allowed to proceed,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/11/thousands-more-to-live-on-floodplain-on-sydneys-fringes-if-developments-allowed-to-proceed
