4/13/2022,"Ukrainian security services have announced the arrest of Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Ukraine, the oligarch and opposition politician Viktor Medvedchuk, in what they called a “lightning-fast and dangerous” operation. The capture of Medvedchuk, who escaped house arrest on treason charges days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, was first announced by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who posted a picture of the detainee on social media, dishevelled, in handcuffs and dressed in army fatigues with a Ukrainian flag patch. “A special operation was carried out by the security service of Ukraine. Well done!” Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram, and later suggested exchanging him for Ukrainian prisoners of war held by Russia. In an early morning broadcast, the president said it was “important for our security forces and military forces to consider such a possibility”. Medvedchuk got rich from Russian oil interests and his proximity to the Kremlin. Putin is godfather to his youngest daughter, and Medvedchuk’s coalition, Opposition Platform – For Life, pursued a pro-Moscow agenda until he was charged with treason in May 2021, accused of selling military secrets to Russia and exploiting the natural resources of Crimea under Russian occupation. He denied wrongdoing and was under house arrest before fleeing during the first days of the invasion. Investigators who went to Medvedchuk’s house found a replica of a vintage Pullman railway carriage, opulently furnished with gold fittings, standing at a mock-up of a railway station, all hidden under a tarpaulin. His $200m 93-meter yacht, the Royal Romance, was seized in the Croatian port of Rijeka last month. In January, the US put Medvedchuk and three other Moscow-backed Ukrainian politicians under sanctions, accusing them of involvement in a plot to set up a collaborator government in the wake of the Russian invasion. Zelenskiy also suspended Medvedchuk’s party – Ukraine’s largest opposition grouping – and several other smaller political parties tied to Moscow in March. Medvedchuk’s arrest and indictment angered Putin who threatened to respond to what he deemed to be political persecution. It was not immediately clear where and how he was captured. Ivan Bakanov, the head of the security service (SBU), thanked his investigators and counterintelligence officers who “proved their professionalism and conducted a lightning and dangerous multi-level special operation to detain deputy Medvedchuk”. “You can hide from justice. You can even wear a Ukrainian military uniform to disguise … But will it help you escape from punishment? Not at all!” the SBU said in a tweet. Kyiv’s crackdown on Medvedchuk had sparked anger in the Kremlin, with Putin vowing at one stage to “respond” to what he called a political persecution. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, would not comment on news of Medvedchuk’s capture, telling Russian reporters that “there are a lot of fakes coming from Ukraine” and “this needs to be checked first”.",News/World news,Ukraine announces arrest of Putin ally in ‘lightning-fast’ operation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/ukraine-arrest-putin-ally-viktor-medvedchuk
4/13/2022,"How do you kill that which cannot be killed? Sanctioned, escrowed, hawked about the place like a bag of meat in a country pub: but still that self-fuelling, indissoluble substance that is Chelsea Football Club continued to roll along on an extraordinary night at the Bernabéu. There was defeat with honour for Chelsea here, a 3-2 win over 120 thrilling gruelling, relentlessly high craft minutes that translated into a 5-4 loss on aggregate. But the numbers hardly told the story, on an evening that felt also like a kind of farewell, a Viking funeral for an undeniably glorious part of this club’s history. It seemed fitting Chelsea’s three starting academy players were among the stars. Mason Mount was teak-tough, whip-smart and a relentless pest for Madrid’s midfield. Ruben Loftus-Cheek ran himself into the ground. But the real heart of Chelsea’s act of resisting to the fates was Reece James, whose defensive performance in the Bernabéu was jaw-droppingly fine, so good that Chelsea’s main concern now must be a business plan convincing enough to keep him on the staff. James spent eighty minutes on a yellow, but kept following Vinícius Jr, bogging him down, dogging his steps. Deep into the second half he preserved Chelsea’s lead with a precision piece of micro-surgery defending, defending on the nanobot scale, picking the ball off Karim Benzema’s toe from just behind him with the scalpel point of his toe. On the ball he kept coming forward. When he didn’t have it he simply stood, socks down, and glowered, or prowled or stalked. John Terry had a more theatrical leadership pheromone. James just carries it with him. Madrid had been in imperial mood from late afternoon, the city illuminated by an electrical storm, streets around the Bernabéu swimming with painterly puddles, and mobbed with a pre-celebratory scarf-twirling vanguard. Don’t Play With The King read the banner along the ultras end before kick-off, accompanied by a vast and slightly weird Viking-based cartoon. It sounds ridiculous. It looked great from the upper tiers of this vast cantilevered concrete bowl, the lights brilliantly harsh, the pitch a dazzling deep lime. Thomas Tuchel had used a lot of exciting words in his pre-match chat, words like “duels”, “offensive transition” and “an extraordinary percentage of won challenges”. He seemed to be daring his own team to go back into that space where nothing matters but this, where every sprint, every challenge is the last sprint, the last challenge, to exist only in that moment in time. And Chelsea did go there. they pressed high from kick off in rejigged 4-3-1-2. James snapped into a couple of challenges. Timo Werner crash-tackled his way past three players, revering off to the right of the penalty box like a fly buzzing down a window pane. Kai Havertz dumped Toni Kroos on the ground. This was all good. Then it happened. Chelsea kept the ball for two minutes. The stands began to whistle. Tuchel came rushing suddenly to the edge of his rectangle in his tight blue quilted coat, combination punching invisible orcs, pointing at spaces, angles, possibilities. Mateo Kovacic’s neat fizzed pass bobbling about between Loftus-Cheek and Werner, then on into the run of Mount, who had time to settle his stride, look up and belt a wonderful strike of the bouncing ball past Thibaut Courtois. Mount has many cerebral qualities, a state of the art academy product. But he is also an utterly nerveless footballer. Still Chelsea kept on pressing wildly, recklessly high, pinning Madrid back when they could. And so it went on after the break. James almost scored, his shot deflected just wide. From there Mount’s corner was pummelled back across the goal by a flying Antonio Rüdiger, a wonderful leaping, barging, alpha dog header. And with 16 minutes gone it was on: Werner seemed to be blocked off in the box by Casemiro, who then did something odd, opting to simply lie down on his back, like a man leaping down a water slide. Werner, jinked past, then saw David Alaba and Dani Carvajal also slipping, sliding, flailing all around him as his shot spun off Courtois and into the corner. It couldn’t last. Madrid clawed it back to extra time thanks to a piece of outright cackling wizardry from Luka Modric, whose pass to put Rodrigo in on goal came hovering and dipping and howling out of the sky, travelling on some invisible lay line. The decisive goal came from Chelsea weariness, brutally punished by Benzema. Chelsea still have the FA Cup to play for. But the league is gone, Europe is gone, the limits of what can still be wrung out of the age of Roman have shrunk. We will never again see Abramovich clutching some pot, mute, tolerantly amused, but with the look of a man already silently signalling for the teleport machine. Other rainmakers, other billionaires other impresarios will come and go. What can’t be denied, whatever the undertones, the deep text, is the spectacle, the circus, the impossible plot-lines, the notes of glory, the tribal togetherness. Football has become something else in the course of the Abramovich timeline. But one question has undoubtedly been answered. Are you not entertained?",Sport/Football,Reece James stands out as Chelsea era ends in honourable defeat | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/12/reece-james-stands-out-as-chelsea-era-ends-in-honourable-defeat
4/13/2022,"It was a Champions League mission that was supposed to be impossible for Chelsea. And yet it was one that they thought they had pulled off. They had refused to wallow when, two goals to the good thanks to Mason Mount and Antonio Rüdiger, they were cruelly denied by a VAR overrule after Marcos Alonso thought that he had made it 3-0 in the 62nd minute. Instead, Timo Werner did make it 3-0. For so many reasons, it had to be the cult hero forward and, if the travelling fans struggled to make sense of it all – utterly lost in the moment – they were not the only ones. To put the size of the challenge that Chelsea had faced into some sort of perspective, only one club had ever overturned a two-goal deficit from a home first-leg in the Champions League knock-out rounds. That was Manchester United in 2019 against a Paris Saint-Germain team managed by, you guessed it, Thomas Tuchel. The problem was that Real Madrid were not finished. They never are. If they have 13 European Cups, they seem to have almost as many lives in the competition every season. They dug out the equaliser when Luka Modric unfurled a sumptuous outside-of-the-boot pass for the substitute, Rodrygo, to volley home although, even then, Chelsea might have pinched it after the 90 minutes were up. Twice, the substitute, Christian Pulisic, blazed high when well placed. Real would fashion what proved to be decisive blow in the early running of extra time. When Vinícius Júnior stood up a cross from the left, Karim Benzema – Real’s hat-trick hero of the first-leg – melted away from Rüdiger and the Chelsea defender could only turn in horror, slipping as he tumbled over, powerless to prevent what was coming, Benzema buried the header. Chelsea refused to go quietly, just as they had refused to bow at any point. The drama was remorseless until the end, Kai Havertz heading wide when gloriously placed and the substitute, Jorginho, dragging a shot past the post when he had to score. The full-time whistle triggered an outpouring of emotion. Real were jubilant, reprieved; Chelsea devastated. Their defence of the competition is over. Chelsea had been to Madrid last season and drawn, en route to their aggregate victory in the semi-final, but they had not been here. Never before had they played at the Bernabéu in European competition. The game last season was staged at Real’s training complex in front of no fans while this venue underwent renovations. Now it was packed and the home hordes simply expected their club to advance through the 37th European Cup quarter-final of their history. “No juegues con el rey” read the slogan on the giant tifo unfurled before kick-off. The image showed a king flicking out cards with the number 13 above a Champions League trophy. Don’t play with him, OK? Tuchel shuffled his pack, dramatically. Chelsea’s first-leg performance had been defined by a lack of intensity and he badly wanted to see that return. It was why he started with Werner amid other willing runners. But it was the 4-3-1-2 shape that represented the eye-catcher; Ruben Loftus-Cheek on the right of midfield, Mount behind split strikers. Chelsea enjoyed a good spell of possession, Loftus-Cheek worked the ball forward and Werner made a flick, which he did not seem to know too much about, and there suddenly was Mount bursting into a wide open seam. He took on the chance first time – he had to – and the technique was true, which it usually is. The ball fizzed past Thibaut Courtois. Tuchel did not want to die wondering. It was marvellously swashbuckling stuff because Real could see the spaces in behind the Chelsea defence. Vinícius Júnior eyed them covetously. He was frequently one-on-one with Reece James and there was a moment early on when he tricked past him to buy a free-kick and a yellow card for his marker. Benzema lifted a shot over the crossbar. Tuchel’s reasoning was plain. No risk, no reward. In possession, Loftus-Cheek pushed high up the right while Alonso did likewise from left-back. James slid across from right-back to make a defensive three. Mount drifted all over. He seemed to be everywhere. It was flexible, cohesive. Before the breakthrough goal, Kai Havertz had seen a shot blocked after Chelsea pinched the ball high up while Rüdiger nodded over from the subsequent corner. For Real, Benzema had an effort from distance that deflected high on 24 minutes but there was not much else from them before the interval. Chelsea’s system hinged on the tactical awareness of James, not to mention his power in the duels, and they continued to push in the second half. Real did not know whether to stick or twist. Havertz got into dangerous areas and, after Real only half-cleared a corner, the irrepressible James flashed a low shot just wide. Did it really flick off Modric? Real argued not. But from Mount’s corner, Rüdiger brushed aside Modric and planted a header past Courtois. Finally, Real stirred. Benzema was thwarted by a saving James tackle, Édouard Mendy pushed away a Toni Kroos free-kick and Federico Valverde blasted just over. And yet it was Chelsea who thought they had found the next goal. N’Golo Kanté led the break after Mount and Havertz had robbed Ferland Mendy and, when Alonso got a second bite off Dani Carvajal, he lashed into the far corner with his right foot. And yet the second bite was revealed by VAR to have been aided by his hand, even if it looked inadvertent. It was brutally cruel.",Sport/Football,Karim Benzema breaks Chelsea hearts with extra-time winner for Real Madrid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/real-madrid-chelsea-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report
