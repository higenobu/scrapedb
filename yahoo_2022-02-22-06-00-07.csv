2/22/2022,"Neanderthal genes which protected people from smallpox could be the reason some ethnic groups are more at risk from Covid, a new study suggests. Throughout the pandemic, South Asians have been at greater risk of severe Covid, even when accounting for factors like deprivation, jobs and living conditions. Dr Hugo Zeberg, of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, showed that mutated genes inherited from Neanderthals doubled the risk of severe Covid. Around half of South Asians carry the mutations, compared to one-fifth of Europeans, but Dr Zeberg realised the variants must have been beneficial at one time in order for them to be passed on. In new research, he found that they lower the risk of HIV by about 27 per cent, suggesting they would also prevent other diseases that enter cells in the same way, such as smallpox. “This major genetic risk factor for Covid-19 is so common that I started wondering whether it might actually be good for something, such as providing protection against another infectious disease”, said Dr Hugo Zeberg. “We don't know at the moment why it was likely advantageous 10,000 years ago. There are many genes involved in the immune system in this region of the genome, so there are many plausible candidate genes. “If I were to guess, smallpox would be a good candidate. It also enters cells using chemokine receptors. But at this point, this is just speculation.” Some people become seriously ill when infected with coronavirus while others have only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. In addition to known risk factors such as advanced age and other illnesses like diabetes, genes also contribute to the chances of ending up with a severe infection. People with the Neanderthal mutation on chromosome three have fewer CCR5 receptors which HIV uses to enter human cells, the same entry method as smallpox, so researchers believe the mutation may have happened thousands of years ago to protect against the deadly virus, which has since been eradicated. “This shows how a genetic variant can be both good and bad news: Bad news if a person contracts Covid-19, good news because it offers protection against getting infected with HIV. “Now we know that this risk variant for Covid-19 provides protection against HIV. But it was probably protection against yet another disease that increased its frequency after the last ice age.” The research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",Health/The Telegraph,Neanderthal gene could explain why some ethnic groups suffer worse from Covid than others,https://news.yahoo.com/neanderthal-gene-could-explain-why-141853876.html
2/22/2022,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's prime minister said on Monday a Chinese naval vessel that pointed a laser at an Australian military aircraft was so close to Australia's coast that it could have been seen from the shore, and urged a full Chinese investigation. Scott Morrison told media his government had not received an explanation from China over the incident last Thursday, which Australia considered ""dangerous and reckless"". China said Australia's version of events did ""not square up with facts"" and that Australia had dropped a Sonobuoy, which can help detect submarines, near Chinese ships. The Australian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Chinese navy vessel directed a military-grade laser at an Australian military aircraft over Australia's northern approaches, illuminating the plane and potentially endangering lives, Australia said on Saturday. Such a laser is normally pointed to designate a target ahead of the discharging of a weapon. The P-8A Poseidon - a maritime patrol aircraft - detected a laser emanating from a People's Liberation Army – Navy (PLA-N) vessel, the Defence Department said, releasing photographs of two Chinese vessels sailing close to Australia's north coast. A Chinese guided missile destroyer and an amphibious transport dock were sailing east through the Arafura Sea between New Guinea and Australia at the time of the incident, and later passed through the narrow Torres Strait. ""It's possible people could even see the vessel from our mainland, potentially,"" Morrison told reporters in Tasmania on Monday. Australia had called through diplomatic and defence channels for ""a full investigation into this event"", he said. He compared the incident to a hypothetical situation of an Australian frigate pointing a laser at Chinese surveillance aircraft in the Taiwan Strait, adding: ""Could you imagine their reaction to that in Beijing?"" China's defence ministry defended the actions of its vessels, saying its vessels abided by international law and pinning any blame on Australia. ""The Australian P-8 anti-submarine patrol aircraft arrived in the airspace around our ship formation, and the nearest was only 4 kilometers away from our ship,"" defence ministry spokesman Tan Kefei said in a post on the ministry's official Weibo page published on Monday. ""From the photos taken by our ships, it can be seen that the Australian plane is very close to our ship and also drops Sonobuoys around our ship. Such malicious provocative behavior is very easy to lead to misunderstanding and misjudgment, posing a threat to the safety of ships and personnel on both sides,"" Tan added. Two Chinese defence ministry stamped photos, which could not be verified, were attached with the Weibo post. ""We demand that the Australian side immediately stop similar provocative and dangerous actions and stop making groundless accusations and smears against the Chinese side, so as not to affect the overall situation of relations between the two countries and two militaries,"" Tan said.

2/22/2022,"Longtime Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto returned to the airwaves after a five-week absence he said was due to a battle with COVID-induced pneumonia. “I’m back,” Cavuto declared Monday morning on his Fox Business Network show, which has featured a rotation of fill-in hosts while he was off-air for previously undisclosed reasons. “I did get COVID again—but a far, far more serious strand, what doctors call ‘COVID pneumonia,’” he confirmed. “It landed me in intensive care for quite a while and it really was touch-and-go.” The affable host joked: “Some of you who’ve wanted to put me out of my misery darn near got what you wished for! So, sorry to disappoint you!” The Year Neil Cavuto, Fox News’ Affable Trump Skeptic, Got Angry The fully vaccinated Cavuto—who has long been open about surviving cancer, living with multiple sclerosis, and undergoing open-heart surgery in 2016— also took shots at the anti-vaxxers who might suggest the jab got him sick. “The vaccine didn’t cause that. That grassy knoll theory has come up a lot. My very compromised immune system did... I’m among the vulnerable three percent or so of the population that cannot sustain the full benefits of a vaccine,” he explained. “But let me be clear, doctors say had I not been vaccinated at all, I wouldn’t be here.” He continued of his battle against the deadly virus: “This was scary. How scary? I’m talking, ‘Ponderosa suddenly out of the prime rib in the middle of the buffet line scary!’ That’s how scary. No matter, I’m not here to debate vaccinations for you. Just offer an explanation for me. I owed you that.” After first testing positive for the virus in Oct. 2021, Cavuto pleaded with the network’s viewers to get their vaccines: “Life is too short to be an ass,” he said at the time. “Stop the deaths. Stop the suffering. Please, get vaccinated.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

2/22/2022,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan’s premier wants a Taiwanese Olympic speedskater to be punished for wearing what appeared to be a suit from China’s team during training. Symbols of the two sides are especially sensitive at a time when China's ruling Communist Party, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory even though the island has long operated with its own government, is trying to intimidate the democracy by flying fighter jets and bombers nearby. Huang Yu-ting, one of four Taiwanese athletes at the Winter Games, posted a video on her social media page Jan. 23 showing her training in what appeared to be a Chinese suit, the Central News Agency reported. It said Huang apologized and removed the video. Premier Su Tseng-chang asked the Ministry of Education and the Sports Administration to investigate so Huang would “receive an adequate punishment,” CNA reported, citing a Cabinet spokesperson, Lo Ping-cheng. The Olympics are one facet of a wide-ranging campaign by Beijing to isolate Taiwan. The International Olympic Committee requires Taiwanese athletes to compete under the name “Chinese Taipei,” which obscures the island’s longstanding self-ruled status. Taiwan’s Sports Administration said Huang would face no penalty but should be “more aware of the sensitivity of cross-Taiwan Strait politics,” according to CNA. The Taiwanese team leader at the Olympics, Steven Chen, said the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee would review in April whether Huang was wearing the appropriate clothing, according to CNA. ___ More AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/winter-olympics and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",World/Associated Press,Taiwan premier wants athlete punished for wearing China suit,https://news.yahoo.com/taiwan-premier-wants-athlete-punished-055726334.html
