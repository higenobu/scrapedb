4/26/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk agreed to buy Twitter Inc. for $44 billion, using one of the biggest leveraged buyout deals in history to take private a 16-year-old social networking platform that has become a hub of public discourse and a flashpoint in the debate over online free speech. Most Read from Bloomberg Elon Musk Lands Deal to Take Twitter Private for $44 Billion ‘Weak Sauce’: Elon Musk’s 2018 Feud With Saudi Fund Revealed Anger in Japan as Ukraine Links Emperor Hirohito to Adolf Hitler Musk Nears $43 Billion Deal for Twitter as Soon as Monday Stocks Set for Cautious Open on China Covid Worry: Markets Wrap Investors will receive $54.20 for each Twitter share they own, the company said in a statement Monday. The price is 38% more than the stock’s close on April 1, the last business day before Musk disclosed a significant stake in the company, sparking a share rally. Musk, one of Twitter’s most-watched users with more than 83 million followers, began amassing a stake of about 9% in January. By March, he had ramped up his criticism of Twitter, alleging that the company’s algorithms are biased and feeds cluttered with automated junk posts. He also suggested Twitter’s user growth was inflated by bots. After rejecting an invitation to join the company’s board, on April 14 he offered to take Twitter private, saying he’d make the platform a bastion of free speech and dropping other hints about the changes he’d make as owner. The ideas verged from the practical -- say, letting users edit tweets and combating the spread of bots -- to the peculiar, such as a proposal to turn the company’s San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter. “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said in the statement on Monday. “Twitter has tremendous potential – I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.” The deal was unanimously approved by the company’s board, and is expected to be completed later this year. Musk, the world’s richest person, secured $25.5 billion of debt and margin loan financing and will provide about $21 billion in equity to fund the deal, according to the statement. Musk’s deal to buy Twitter includes a provision that the billionaire is required to pay the company a fee if he were to walk away or the deal falls apart, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal does not include a “go-shop provision,” meaning Twitter isn’t allowed to solicit offers from other potential bidders. When they resumed trading after a halt for the news, Twitter shares jumped 5.7% to $51.70 at the close in New York. Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal sent an email to Twitter employees as the news was announced, informing them of a companywide meeting scheduled for 2 p.m. to talk about the deal. “I know this is a significant change and you’re likely processing what this means for you and Twitter’s future,” he wrote. Though Musk hasn’t outlined a specific plan to change Twitter’s policies around speech and content moderation, his acquisition of the company means one of the internet’s thorniest problems is now his own. Musk has spoken openly about his plans to make the platform a haven for unfettered speech online and has complained that the service is too heavy-handed when it comes to moderating user tweets. The debate around free speech on social media has been raging for years -- some political conservatives say Twitter, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and other internet companies have too many rules, while liberals don’t think social networks go far enough to prevent hate speech and attacks on their services. It’s a conflict that has led to numerous congressional hearings over the years and a movement to overhaul U.S. regulations around online content.

Twitter caught fire among politicians, celebrities and journalists and took its place alongside social media stalwarts Facebook and YouTube as a standard bearer of a new, more interactive way of using the web that came to be known as Web 2.0. Following its birth in 2006, the company weathered a series of crises, including management upheaval that saw the removal of co-founder Jack Dorsey in Twitter’s early days and his eventual return in 2015. After an initial public offering in 2013, the company considered selling itself in 2016, drawing the interest of companies from Walt Disney Co. to Salesforce Inc. Dorsey in 2020 tangled with an activist investor that forced Twitter to set specific growth targets and add greater board accountability. That served as a catalyst for Dorsey’s eventual second departure so he could focus on his other company, the digital-payments company Block Inc. Agrawal, formerly the company’s chief technology officer, took the helm in November. Read more: Jack Dorsey’s post-Twitter quest to become Bitcoin’s spiritual leader As recently as last week there was little clarity on whether Musk’s bid would succeed. The 50-year-old billionaire himself mused at a TED event the day it was announced that even he had doubts about its prospects. Though the stock initially jumped on news of Musk’s stake in the company, shares have traded well below the original offer price of $54.20 since its announcement -- a sign investors were skeptical a deal would come to fruition. Twitter on April 15 adopted a shareholder rights plan -- a measure known as a poison pill -- to fend off unwanted bidders. The plan is exercisable if a party acquires 15% of the stock without prior approval, and sought to ensure that anyone taking control of the social media company through open market accumulation pays all shareholders an appropriate control premium, the company said when it disclosed the plan. But a turning point came last week when the Tesla Inc. CEO pulled together a financing plan that included 12 banks, led by Morgan Stanley. Just days after revealing the plan, Musk met with Twitter executives as the company turned more receptive toward a deal, a person with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News on Sunday. After accepting Musk’s bid, Twitter locked down changes to its platform through Friday, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the situation is private. Twitter imposed the temporary ban to keep employees who may be miffed about the deal from “going rogue,” according to one of the people. Many of the company’s employees have expressed uneasiness about the idea of Musk taking charge. As part of the deal announcement, Twitter said it will report first-quarter earnings as planned on April 28 before the market opens in New York, but won’t host a call to discuss the results. While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will have to review the plan once Twitter files a preliminary proxy statement, the regulator doesn’t have the power to block the merger outright. Still, the SEC can slow the process down by asking Twitter for clarification on aspects of the deal, according to Kenneth Henderson, a partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner in New York. The company’s shareholders will vote to approve the transaction only once all of the agency’s questions are answered.

4/26/2022,"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc CEO Parag Agrawal would get an estimated $42 million if he were terminated within 12 months of a change in control at the social media company, according to research firm Equilar. On Monday billionaire Elon Musk struck a deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion, ending its run as a public company since 2013. Musk in a securities filing on April 14 had said he did not have confidence in Twitter's management. Equilar's estimate includes a year’s worth of Agrawal's base salary plus accelerated vesting of all equity awards, an Equilar spokesperson said, based on Musk’s offering price of $54.20 per share and terms in the company's recent proxy statement. A Twitter representative declined to comment on Equilar's estimate. Agrawal, previously Twitter's chief technology officer, was named CEO in November. His total compensation for 2021 was $30.4 million, according to Twitter's proxy, largely in stock awards.

4/26/2022,"One thing is clear in the current market conditions: it’s a time of transition. Over the past four months, the stock market has shifted from the bull run we saw in 2021 into a far more volatile state of affairs. The market dipped into correction territory in March, bounced back out in April, and now is heading down again. One result of this has been an increase in bond yields, as equities have dropped. And with the Federal Reserve embarking on a new round of interest rate hikes, that promises a move toward higher yields. Weighing in on current market conditions, Morgan Stanley chief European equity strategist Graham Secker noted, ""There’s a plausible argument that equity valuations had already derated in advance of this move and that the rise in real yields has simply recoupled the two series back together. Hence, if real yields move higher from here, equities will need to derate further.” Secker’s outlook, if taken at face value, makes it plain that investor will need to take defensive measures to protect their portfolios. Any farmer can tell you that there’s no point slamming the barn door after the horses have bolted, and the same holds true for stocks. The best time to shore up the portfolio is before the worst becomes obvious. With this in mind, we've used the TipRanks database to pinpoint two stocks that match a solid defensive profile: a Strong Buy from the analyst’s collective wisdom and a dividend yield of 7% or more. Let's take a closer look. OneMain Holdings (OMF) We’ll start with OneMain, a financial services company with a twist. OneMain focuses its efforts on the low-end retail customer segment, offering affordable loans, consumer finance, and insurance products. This is a customer base that won’t necessarily qualify for credit services from larger banking companies, due to higher risk factors and lower credit scores. OneMain, however, sees this as a lucrative potential market. The company’s revenue stream would tend to indicate that OneMain is correct in its assessment of the customer base. In the past two years, the quarterly top line has been consistently high, between $1.2 billion and $1.28 billion. The last reported quarter, 4Q21, was at the top of that range, and was up 5% year-over-year. Quarterly EPS came in at $2.38, down from $2.77 in the year-ago quarter. On the positive side, EPS came in just above the $2.35 forecast – and marked the 7th consecutive quarter that the bottom line beat the estimates. For the full year 2021, OneMain reported $9.87 in earnings per share, a strong increase from the $5.41 per share reported for the full year in 2020. Overall, management was pleased with the 4Q earnings, and expressed that confidence through a 36% increase in the quarterly common share dividend. This payment was bumped up to 95 cents per share, and was paid out in February of this year. With an annualized payment of $3.80, OneMain’s dividend yields 8%. In coverage for Wells Fargo, 5-star analyst Michael Kaye notes that recession fears have put pressure on OneMain’s stock price recently, but points to a relatively sound position for US consumers – OneMain’s key customer base – as reason for optimism on the stock. “OneMain shares (along with the consumer finance sector) have been weak on recession fears exacerbated by inflation/higher energy prices. While this certainly contributes to downside risks to the U.S. economy, our belief is that we will avoid tipping into a recession. We think the backdrop for the U.S. consumer remains solid driven in part by a strong employment picture. Thus, we think recession risk ultimately fades, and we view the current share price as a buying opportunity,” Kaye opined. In line with this comments, Kaye rates OMF stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy), with a $70 price target that indicates room for ~41% upside in the coming year. (To watch Kaye’s track record, click here) While upbeat, Kaye’s take on OneMain in certainly not an outlier – this stock has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, supported by 6 positive analyst reviews. The shares are priced at $46.09 and their $66.33 average price target suggests an upside of 44% for the year ahead. (See OMF stock forecast on TipRanks) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) The second stock we’ll look at is a midstream energy company. Like the finance sector, the energy sector has long been known for offering high dividends. Enterprise Products Partners supports its own dividend with operations in the collection, transport, storage, processing, and export of hydrocarbon products, including crude oil, refined petroleum, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. High prices in the energy sector over the past year and more have supported Enterprise’s stock price; where the S&P 500 is down 12.5% year-to-date, EPD stock has gained 20% in that same time. Enterprise moved to increase its asset network recently, and in January the company announced that it had entered an agreement to acquire Navitas Midstream. This move brought more than 1,700 pipeline miles and over 1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas processing capabilities into Enterprise’s network. The transaction cost Enterprise $3.25 billion in cash, and was completed in February. The company’s revenues have been consistently increasing, with 5 sequential gains since bottoming out in 2Q20. The last quarter reported was 4Q21, in which the top line came in at $11.65 billion, up 65% year-over-year. Quarterly EPS was 47 cents, missing the 54-cent forecast but more than tripling y/y. For the full year 2021, Enterprise reported $4.6 billion in net income, delivering an EPS of $2.10 per share. These full-year results were up significantly from the 2020 figures, with net income growing 21% and full year EPS growing 22%. Of particular interest to dividend investors, Enterprise’s free cash flow in 2021 grew y/y from $2.7 billion to $6.3 billion. This is the metric that supports the dividend, and earlier this month Enterprise declared its next common share dividend payment at 46.5 cents, payable on May 12. This payment annualizes to $1.86 and gives a yield of 7%. Enterprise has a long history, 13 years, of slowing growing its common share dividend payment. Justin Jenkins, 5-star analyst with Raymond James, is bullish on Enterprise, writing: “EPD's unique combination of asset integration, balance sheet strength, and ROIC track record remains best in class. Further, said track record is more relevant than ever in the context of the recent Navitas deal. We see EPD as arguably best positioned in midstream from a volatility vs. recovery perspective — and buybacks remain an upside lever in 2022+. Meanwhile, EPD still trades at an attractive ~7% yield and a historically discounted ~9.5x 2023E EV/EBITDA (~11.5x 5-year average).” ""With a healthy outlook and a compelling entry point,"" Jenkins rates EPD a Strong Buy along with a $30 price target. Shares could appreciate ~17%, should the analyst’s thesis play out in the coming months. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here) Wall Street is in broad agreement with the bull here, as evidenced by the 7 to 2 split in the recent share reviews, favoring Buys over Holds and backing a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $25.70 and the $30.13 average target is practically the same as Jenkins' objective.

4/26/2022,"This might be the hottest housing market ever recorded. Over the past 12 months, U.S. home prices are up a staggering 19.2%. For comparison, in the years leading into the 2008 housing bust, the biggest 12-month jump was 14.5%. Heading into 2022, real estate research firms forecasted that the ongoing housing boom would lose some steam and home price growth would decelerate. It hasn't come to fruition—yet. Actually, if anything, this year it has gotten a bit hotter, with housing inventory on Zillow down 52% from pre-pandemic levels. That stubbornly hot housing market now has housing economists flirting with the real estate industry's most feared word: bubble. “We’re not in a housing bubble just yet—but we’re skating close to one if prices continue rising at the current pace,"" said George Ratiu, a housing economist at Realtor.com, in an article published last week on the home listing site. It isn't just Ratiu. There's a growing chorus of economists speculating that if home price growth doesn't abate soon, the housing market could eventually overheat. Or worse: We could wind up in another full-fledged housing bubble. Back in March, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas sent a shockwave through the industry after releasing a paper titled Real-Time Market Monitoring Finds Signs of Brewing U.S. Housing Bubble. The Dallas Fed researchers were blunt in their assessment: ""U.S. house prices are again becoming unhinged from fundamentals."" But even if we're in a housing bubble, the Dallas Fed researchers don't think it would be a 2008 repeat. For starters, homeowners are in much better shape now than they were heading into the 2008 meltdown. At the height of the 2000s housing bubble, U.S. households were spending 7.2% of disposable personal income on mortgage debt payments. As of the fourth quarter of 2021, that figure is just 3.8%. In addition, subprime mortgages are less of a worry these days, given the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act outlawed many of the shady loans that plagued the aughts. “There is no expectation that fallout from a housing correction would be comparable to the 2007–09 global financial crisis in terms of magnitude or macroeconomic gravity. Among other things, household balance sheets appear in better shape, and excessive borrowing doesn’t appear to be fueling the housing market boom,” write the Dallas Fed researchers. Historically speaking, U.S. homeowners are in a fairly strong financial position. But they aren't who economists are worried about. Instead, they're concerned about the next crop of homebuyers. Back in December, the typical American household would have to spend 24% of its monthly income to make a mortgage payment on the average-priced U.S. home, according to Black Knight, a mortgage technology and data provider. At the latest reading this month, Black Knight's mortgage-payment-to-income ratio was now up to 31%—the highest reading since September 2007. (During the 2010s decade, that figure averaged 19.9%.) What's going on? The swift move up in mortgage rates over the past few months has dramatically increased mortgage payments for new borrowers. Back in December, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate stood at 3.11%. At that rate, a borrower would owe a $2,138 monthly principal and interest payment on a $500,000 mortgage. A borrower who took out that same mortgage at the current average rate (5.11%) would owe $2,718 per month. Over the course of the 30-year loan, that's an additional $208,800 in payments. Soaring mortgage rates could be a good thing. At least that's the message from Logan Mohtashami, lead analyst at HousingWire. He sees a housing market that needs to lose some steam. The spike in mortgage rates, he says, could result in home shoppers backing off a bit. There are some signs it is already starting to happen. If the housing market does slow, he says, it could allow inventory levels to rise and ultimately see us move into a market with lower levels of home price appreciation. Every single major real estate research firm with a publicly available forecast model projects that home prices will continue to climb over the coming year. Over the coming 12 months, Zillow predicts home prices are poised to spike 14.9%. CoreLogic forecasts a more modest 5% jump, while the Mortgage Bankers Association predicts prices will climb 4.8%. Industry insiders do say there's a chance the economic shock caused by soaring mortgage rates could see home prices drop in some regional housing markets. ""Some markets will see a correction if mortgage rates continue to rise, in which sales will drop and prices will follow,"" Realtor.com's Ratiu said in the home listing site's article, published on April 19. Where might prices drop? Ratiu points to Rust Belt markets like Toledo and Rochester, N.Y. While housing economists who have spoken to Fortune aren't predicting a housing correction or crash, they do see a market that's starting to reach concerning levels. Earlier this month, CoreLogic provided Fortune with its regional market risk assessment scores for around 400 metropolitan statistical areas. The real estate research firm aimed to find out whether local income levels could support regional home prices. The finding? CoreLogic now considers 65% of U.S. regional housing markets to be ""overvalued."" That ""overvalued"" label was placed on every metropolitan statistical area in Arizona, Florida, Texas, and Nevada.

4/26/2022,"Brutal earnings days may be the new norm for Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta (FB) as the social media giant deals with slowing growth, elevated expenses, and high expectations. ""I certainly think it's possible [it reports another bad quarter],"" Technalysis founder Bob O'Donnell said about Meta on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Meta will report its first quarter results on April 27 after the close of trading. O'Donnell, who noted that Big Tech earnings overall will likely be a ""mixed bag,"" said that “in the case of Meta, it will be an interesting story. There’s been a lot of challenges there. We’ll see how the advertising space plays out.” It's almost hard to imagine a darker day for Meta than Feb. 3, 2022, when shares crashed 26% after a very disappointing fourth quarter and outlook. The company reported that it added just 2 million monthly active users in the quarter after adding 15 million monthly active users in the previous quarter. Daily active users also fell by 1 million amid increased competition from TikTok. Overall, the company missed analysts' profit estimates by a whopping 14 cents. The resulting stock slide wiped away $251.3 billion in market value from Meta, marking the biggest one-day loss in value for any U.S. company ever. Thus far in 2022, Facebook has seen slowing growth and a $10 billion hit from privacy changes to Apple's iOS operating system. “I don’t see anything that’s necessarily magically corrected,” O’Donnell said. “So I certainly think there is a possibility we will continue to see those kinds of trends for Meta.” Shares of Meta have largely flat-lined since that report as Wall Street braces for another financial shoe to drop at the company. And two shoes arguably have already dropped in the past week, both from outside of Meta's walls. First, a shockingly lackluster quarter and outlook from fellow FAANG member Netflix called into question growth rates at large-cap tech companies. And then a tepid outlook from Snap due to advertising weakness raised questions about the health of the digital ad space. Pros think Meta's quarterly results could showcase similar themes. ""I think the expectations are going to be super low [on Meta],"" veteran tech analyst Mark Mahaney of EvercoreISI, who has a short-term negative rating on Meta, said on Yahoo Finance Live last week. ""I think we will see signs of brand advertising weakness out of Western Europe. I guess currency headwinds will be a bit of an issue."" Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.
