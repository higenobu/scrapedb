5/4/2022,"A recent social media post from Olympic skier Eileen Gu in which she says goodbye to China after months of making it her home for the Beijing Winter Games has drawn both plaudits and criticism.

Gu, who won two gold medals and one silver medal while representing China this year, is making her way back to the U.S. to begin her studies at Stanford University. The star athlete deferred a year to participate in the Winter Games.

On April 27, she shared a post to Weibo saying, “Thank you China,” with emojis of the Chinese flag and a red heart, along with a series of photos from her time in the country.

The hashtag “Gu Ailing posts on Weibo to thank China,"" referring to Gu by her localized name, quickly became a top trending subject on the platform, CNN reported. Within two days, it garnered over 290 million views.

While many of her fans reciprocated the love, some social media users weren’t as impressed by the way she worded her thanks, accusing her of acting ""like a foreigner."" They argued that her post seemed to be her distancing herself from China, as she failed to refer to it in the same way other athletes have in the past, using the words “motherland” or “my country.”

""Ultimately she thinks of herself as an American. She only joined China temporarily,"" a top comment reportedly said.

Weibo has since limited search results for the hashtag to mostly positive comments from official accounts.

Gu, who was born and raised in the U.S., was praised in China for her choice to represent the country her mother is from. Though in doing so, Gu was also criticized by Americans for being “opportunistic,” amid strained U.S.-China relations.

Gu previously faced criticism during the Olympics after advocating for the use of VPNs to bypass the country’s social media restrictions.

5/4/2022,"By Steve Holland, Trevor Hunnicutt and David Brunnstrom WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two months after warning that Beijing appeared poised to help Russia in its fight against Ukraine, senior U.S. officials say they have not detected overt Chinese military and economic support, a welcome development in the tense U.S.-China relationship. U.S. officials told Reuters in recent days they remain wary about China's long-standing support for Russia in general, but that the military and economic support that they worried about has not come to pass, at least for now. The relief comes at a pivotal time. President Joe Biden is preparing for a trip to Asia later this month dominated by how to deal with the rise of China and his administration is soon to release his first national security strategy about the emergence of China as a great power. ""We have not seen the PRC provide direct military support to Russia’s war on Ukraine or engage in systematic efforts to help Russia evade our sanctions,"" a Biden administration official told Reuters, referring to the People's Republic of China. ""We continue to monitor for the PRC and any other country that might provide support to Russia or otherwise evade U.S. and partner sanctions."" As well as steering clear of directly backing Russia's war effort, China has avoided entering new contracts between its state oil refiners and Russia, despite steep discounts. In March its state-run Sinopec Group suspended talks about a major petrochemical investment and a gas marketing venture in Russia. Last month, the U.S. envoy to the United Nations hailed China's abstentions on U.N. votes to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a ""win,"" underscoring how Beijing's enforced balancing act between Russia and the West may be the best outcome for Washington. Still, China has refused to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine and has criticized the sweeping Western sanctions on Moscow. Trade volume between Russia and China also jumped in the first quarter, and the two declared a ""no limits"" partnership in February. On Monday, Beijing's Washington embassy issued a 30-page newsletter accusing the United States of spreading ""falsehoods"" to discredit China over Ukraine, including through a March press leak saying Russia had sought Chinese military help. The embassy noted that U.S. officials had since said they had seen no evidence of China providing such support.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week China is dealing with the ""significant reputational risk"" of being Russia's ally and that ""for now we're not seeing significant support from China for Russia's military actions."" Biden is to visit Tokyo and Seoul in what will be his first trip to Asia as president - one that won't include a stop in China. He'll meet with Indian and Australian leaders too, during a 'Quad' meeting in Tokyo. China has made Russia a key part of its foreign policy strategy to counter the West. Biden aides were worried Xi was planning to provide direct support to Russian President Vladimir Putin as his campaign in Ukraine faced fierce setbacks, one U.S. official said. They were heartened this has not happened so far, but Washington and its allies are continuing to closely monitor the level of assistance, the official said. Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said stark warnings by the U.S. and European Union have paid off so far. ""There has been consistent messaging that if China does so it will face severe consequences. It appears that so far, the Chinese have not. It is feasible that the Chinese planned to provide military assistance and changed their minds,"" she said. However U.S. officials remain concerned about China's refusal to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine and what they say is its continued parroting of Russian disinformation. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on April 21 that Beijing had ""repeatedly drawn false equivalencies between Russia's war of aggression and Ukraine's self-defensive actions."" She added: ""Let's be clear, China's already doing things that do not help this situation.""

5/4/2022,"STORY: Security footage shows the moment when assistant corrections director Vicky White escorted Casey White, a murder suspect, out of a detention center in Alabama last Friday (April 29). The footage, provided by Lauderdale County Sheriff’s Office, captured the last time both fugitives, considered armed and dangerous, were seen. The U.S. Marshals Service was treating the manhunt for the pair, who are not related, as one of its top investigations. Casey White, charged with capital murder in a September 2020 stabbing death and already serving time for a 2015 crime spree including home invasion and carjacking, was last seen on Friday leaving the jail in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, about 65 miles west of Huntsville. At the time, he was handcuffed and shackled in the custody of Vicky White, who was supposedly transporting him by patrol car from the detention center to the county courthouse for a mental evaluation, according to Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton. Authorities realized the two had gone missing after the patrol car was found left in a shopping center parking lot. The sheriff said investigators have since received tips that the inmate and officer switched to another car. The sheriff held out the possibility that Vicky White helped free the inmate under duress, but since then investigators have confirmed information from inmates that both fugitives had “a special relationship.”",World/Reuters Videos,Security footage captures Alabama prison break,https://news.yahoo.com/security-footage-captures-alabama-prison-023924401.html

Detectives learned that the suspect’s three children, who were ages 4 - 9, were in the car with her at the time of the shooting. Griffith has been charged with four counts of aggravated assault, three counts of cruelty to children, and one count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. She was denied bond at her first bond hearing Monday morning. Jones was the only reporter in the courtroom as Griffith took the stand for the first time. Jones talked to Crouch’s mother, Dianna Crouch, who couldn’t believe what Griffith did to her child -- or what she did afterward. Judge Susan Camp with the Douglas County Magistrate Court said Griffith went to get her nails done after the shooting. “That just blows my mind,” Crouch said. “That makes me think she had no remorse.” Ashlyn Crouch told her mother that the car she was riding in accidentally cut Griffith off. “And she shot them the bird, and they shot back,” Crouch said. “(Ashlyn) was shot behind her ear and it came out through the side of her eye right here.” Crouch said her daughter is out of the intensive care unit and in a regular room now. “People just need to take a deep breath, or just stay off the road,” Crouch said.

We will never forget his excitement during Roundup time, from doing interviews with television stations to appearing on televised wildlife shows, he did it all.” His sister said De Leon “had a passion for snake handling” and handled rattlers for “many years.” “He was well loved by those who knew him,” added U.S. Congress candidate Sandra Whitten. “My family and I enjoy watching him handle these deadly snakes with ease, almost like he was simply dancing with them.

Born in the small Brazilian town of Brusque on April 19, 1922, Orthmann wanted to get a job when he was 15 to help with family with financial problems, according to Guinness World Records.
