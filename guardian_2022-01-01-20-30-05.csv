1/1/2022,"From mince pies and biscuits to lipstick and soap, palm oil grown on deforested land in south-east Asia will have been hard to avoid this Christmas. The vegetable oil is found in almost half of all packaged products in UK supermarkets, according to WWF. But a growing number of towns and cities are trying to use only sustainable palm oil, helping orangutans, tigers, Sumatran rhinos and many other threatened species.  Led by Chester in north-west England, the world’s first sustainable palm oil city, restaurants, small businesses and arts venues are joining forces to eradicate deforestation-linked forms of the vegetable oil from their supply chains. A school dinner provider in Chester has even signed up, the first to be certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Oxford, Plymouth and the village of Mochdre in north Wales are following Chester’s lead, with more expected to follow. “The palm oil situation is a big problem,” says Catherine Barton, a field conservation manager at Chester zoo, who has led the sustainable city campaign after a visit to Malaysian Borneo. “Populations of forest elephants and orangutans are separated by plantations. You get human-wildlife conflict when they move into those areas. It was from working with communities that we thought as users [of palm oil], we can try to change the industry.” The UK is a small consumer of mainly sustainable palm oil. Globally, most palm oil is produced in Indonesia and Malaysia and is not sustainably certified by the RSPO. While companies such as Iceland have stopped using palm oil, Barton says an outright ban isnot the answer and making sustainable palm oil the default ingredient in products, from baby formula to shampoo, would have a much bigger impact on conservation, while supporting communities that rely on the palm fruit crop. Chester zoo has helped businesses such as a small Welsh fudge producer and an animal food provider to review and adapt their supply chains with the goal of removing all products containing non-RSPO certified palm oil. What is palm oil? Palm oil is a vegetable oil produced from the fruit of oil palm trees and is originally from Africa. It comes in two forms: one from pressing the flesh of oil palm fruit, the other from crushing its kernel.  Palm oil is one of the most widely used ingredients in the world and is the most efficient vegetable oil to grow, requiring far less land than alternatives like rape seed and maize. However, large areas of rainforest have been cleared for its production. What contains palm oil? Palm oil is everywhere and is often not clearly labelled. Detergent, ice-cream and biofuel are all likely to contain it. WWF produces a list of products that probably contain palm oil. How can I avoid deforestation-linked palm oil? While a considerable amount of environmental destruction is linked to the production of palm oil, many conservation NGOs warn it would be a mistake to boycott it. Instead, WWF, Chester zoo and others advocate the use of sustainable palm oil accredited by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). This should be clearly labelled on products. “If you go palm oil free in the UK, you’re not going to have an impact on orangutans or influence the industry,” says Barton. “So, as an NGO, we feel that we have to be part of that conversation. And we use the UK and Europe as that influencer to change the industry rather than remove ourselves from it.” Barton emphasises that palm oil is a far more productive crop than alternatives such as rapeseed or maize. Large areas of Indonesia and Malaysia have been deforested for palm oil plantations, including carbon-dense peatlands that have been drained and burned, causing enormous greenhouse gas emissions. At Cop26 in Glasgow, world leaders pledged to halt and reverse deforestation and degradation by 2030. Greening global supply chains will be key to achieving that goal. To help protect standing forests, RSPO certification accredits producers and consumers of sustainable palm oil. The UK government is consulting on plans to ban large companies from using products grown on illegally deforested land. Jason Ellison, proprietor of a French restaurant, Chez Jules, was among the first businesses to sign up to the campaign in Chester. He says reviewing his supply chain meant searching for palm oil in unusual places. “I’m not a scientist. The zoo was very helpful. They gave us a list of all the places where you’d find palm oil – in bread, cake mixes, baking products … We use digestive biscuits as a base for one of our desserts, for example. That’s where we were zooming in.” Ian McGrady, managing director of Edsential, a social enterprise that provides school dinners in Chester, says becoming the first RSPO-certified school food provider in England has helped teach children about where their food comes from. “What we want to do is link the school meal to field conservation, so children get to see that if they make a decision, they can make a difference on the ground. Cost tends to trump any kind of ethical sourcing, even within schools,” he says. “We worked with main suppliers to see where they were in terms of palm oil and certification. It absolutely can be done.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,The UK city taking a stand on palm oil in the fight against deforestation,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/01/chester-new-approach-palm-oil-problem-aoe
1/1/2022,"Everton have confirmed the signing of the Dynamo Kyiv defender Vitaliy Mykolenko for an undisclosed fee, with the Ukraine international agreeing a four-and-a-half-year deal. The 22-year-old left-back becomes the Toffees’ first signing of the January transfer window. Mykolenko has won 21 caps for Ukraine and was a key part of Andriy Shevchenko’s team that reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2020.  Speaking after becoming manager Rafa Benítez’s sixth signing, Mykolenko said: “Moving to Everton is a big and important step in my life. I am 22 but I don’t feel like a youngster. I have experience of playing at European level and hope I will continue to improve as a player.” Mykolenko can also operate in central defence and as a wing-back and made his Dynamo debut aged just 18, making his senior international debut one year later. He added: “I like to play on the front foot and get forward when I can. Modern football demands that full-backs are able to attack as well as defend. I think I am a versatile defender who can get up and down the pitch. But I believe desire and commitment are the most important attributes and I will aim to bring those qualities.” Mykolenko is expected to replace Lucas Digne, who has fallen out of favour with Benítez in recent weeks and has been strongly linked with Brighton and Chelsea. Meanwhile, Benítez has likened Dominic Calvert-Lewin to a new signing as the striker prepares to make his first appearance since August. The England international scored in each of the club’s first three matches of the season, but a thigh injury and subsequent setback in his recovery has denied the Everton manager his services until now. There will be a temptation, especially with Richarlison still sidelined by a calf problem, to put Calvert-Lewin in from the start at home to Brighton on Sunday. However, while Benítez is delighted to have last season’s leading scorer back, he has sounded a note of caution about placing too much expectation on him. “He’s a massive signing for us in the second part of the league,” he said. “Last year the top scorers of this team we’re not playing this year so, if we bring him back and a few weeks later Richarlison, we have more options there, we can think of the second part totally different. I’ve explained before that one thing is match fitness that you can improve by playing games and the other thing is fitness. “Fitness-wise he is getting better. Match fitness, we will see. Maybe he scores three goals in the first half and we don’t need to worry about his match fitness, but I think the issue will be how long he can play if he starts the game or, if he comes from the bench, how much impact he can have on the game. “We are considering all of these things but he is training really well and he is really happy because he is with the team and is ready to play and score goals.”",Sport/Football,Everton sign Dynamo Kyiv defender Vitaliy Mykolenko on four-year deal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/everton-sign-dynamo-kyiv-defender-vitaliy-mykolenko-on-four-year-deal
1/1/2022,"Ihave a little outdoor table by the french windows that houses an ever-changing display of pot plants. In summer it has pomegranates, citrus and, towards the back, some ivies. In winter, when the lemons are indoors, I move the ivies to the foreground. Their curtain of leaves distracts from the real reason the table is there: to hide all the pots and seed trays underneath it. I don’t own a shed because I can’t bear to part with the space in the garden, so I am forever finding ways to squirrel away the unsightly parts of gardening. I am not generous to these ivies – they survive in 30cm pots. In spring and autumn I top them up with a little fresh compost, but that’s about it. And yet they thrive. Come winter, I dot pots of early-flowering bulbs between them – reticulata irises, miniature daffodils and snowdrops – so small hints of spring bring a little cheer.  Ivies can spread and climb great distances, but there are many varieties suited to life in cramped, hard conditions, whether that’s a north-facing window box, a sliver of soil along a side return, a shady basement courtyard or an unheated porch. Just don’t try to keep them indoors: ivies are often touted as good houseplants, but you’d need a very cold and damp house to keep them happy. That said, I have visited some very cold bathrooms where they might thrive. On the whole, variegated forms are bred to be vigorous, so there are only a few that will do well in pots. The cream-and-yellow Hedera helix “Little Luzii” is compact and doesn’t spread or climb much. Its mid-green leaves are speckled and splashed with cream. Likewise, H. helix “Midas Touch”, with its heart-shaped leaves and white-and-gold variegation around the edge that turn a lovely pink with a little frost, is good at brightening a dull corner. There are numerous pretty deep-green types – my tabletop variety is H. helix “Koniger’s Auslese”, which has narrow, star-shaped leaves that look good against a painted wall. The same goes for “Ivalace” or “Parsley Crested”, which have crinkled, glossy leaves and do well even in deep shade. The miniature-leaved “Duckfoot”, with its wedge-shape light-green leaves will fill out a pot quickly, which makes it particularly good for hanging baskets. Fibrex Nursery and the Plantsman’s Preference both have an extensive collection. Ivies are not particularly fussy about soils, but do better in slightly alkaline soils, and thrive in composts with good water-holding capacity. This can be achieved by adding composted bark to peat-free compost. Finally, do allow the plants to dry out between watering. A dry plant can make a miraculous recovery, but an overwatered one rots away quickly.",Lifestyle/Life and style,The endless pleasure of potted ivies | Alys Fowler,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/the-endless-pleasure-of-potted-ivies
1/1/2022,"If you made a film of Mark Bracewell’s life, audiences would probably look on sceptically and think: “That’s a bit extreme.” Bracewell grew up on an estate in Moss Side, Manchester, in the 1980s. When he was 13, he watched members of a gang hack a man to death in a pub with a machete. The following year, his friend Benjamin was murdered in a takeaway. The killers were never found. Bracewell thinks it was probably a case of mistaken identity. He was with Benjamin on the day he died. He found out about his murder on the news. “We were kids,” says Bracewell, who is now 44 and lives in Stoke-on-Trent. “But we were living in a war zone.”  He began breaking into cars and selling drugs for the older kids on the estate. “We were manipulated,” he says. “Today you’d call it county lines. Police wouldn’t stop kids.” He joined a gang when he was 13 and became addicted to cocaine four years later. “As I grew older,” he says, “my heart got tighter and smaller. When you’ve seen someone hacked to death with a machete, you grow numb. It was easier to brush everything under the carpet than deal with it. I took drugs as my way out of reality.” Aged 26, he robbed a taxi driver at knifepoint – he was high on cocaine at the time and needed money for drugs – and spent three years and nine months in prison. “It’s embarrassing,” says Bracewell, “but it’s part of my journey.” In 2010, he got out of prison, and started to rebuild his life. He worked as a bar manager but still occasionally used drugs, despite his best efforts to quit. Then, on New Year’s Eve 2016, he got involved in a nightclub fight. “I saw the knife coming towards me,” Bracewell says. “And that was the last thing I ever saw out of that eye. Instantly I knew I was blind in my left eye.” The stabbing was a turning point. As Bracewell was taken to hospital, he cried out to God. “I said,” he remembers, “‘I don’t want to die.’ And I heard God say, ‘You won’t die. I need you to see.’” After his release from prison, Bracewell moved to Stoke, where he was supported by a Christian charity called Walk Ministries, which works with ex-offenders. “I was at a crossroads in my life,” he says, “and I knew I didn’t want to continue doing what I was doing.” The experience reawakened Bracewell’s dormant faith. “I was a Christian growing up,” he says, “but I never followed it.” Now he is committed. At Bracewell’s request, Walk Ministries got him a placement doing youth volunteer work, and he became an anti-knife crime campaigner. He sees a certain symmetry in his new line of work. “The crime I went to prison for involved a knife,” he says, “and I was stabbed with a knife. God is using me as a tool.” He goes into secondary schools to speak about his life, and the mistakes he made. “You get a few kids,” says Bracewell, “who think they know it all, and talk all the way through.” Bracewell has an unorthodox way of grabbing their attention: “I walk up to them,” he chuckles, “and pop my glass eye out, so they get a shock.” That usually quietens them down. The message of these speeches is a serious one. He talks about the statistics of knife crime, and walks them through the consequences of his own mistakes. “I tell them that every decision has a consequence,” Bracewell says. “What do you want that consequence to be?” In the past week, he tells me, he’s spoken to over 4,000 children in just four days, and is absolutely knackered. “It definitely connected with the kids,” says Marc Inchley, who recently invited Bracewell into his further education college. “They sat up and listened to him. Not all the speakers we get in have that impact. He’s doing this for the right reasons.” Bracewell also cofounded an organisation called Blinded Faith, which works with local authorities to mentor at-risk children. He does one-to-one sessions with children who are vulnerable to knife crime. “I can’t get anywhere without building trust,” he says. “If I say to the kids, ‘I’ll be there’ and something happens to them, I have to come through. If they don’t trust me, they won’t give anything back.” When the kids run away from home, or get arrested, Bracewell is often the person they call. He’s driven to Leeds and Wales in the early hours of the morning to collect them. “There are no bad kids,” he says. “Just kids who are making bad choices.” With all his talks at schools, or driving to meet with his mentees, Bracewell spends a lot of time away from his wife and baby. “That’s the hardest thing,” he says. So for his treat, he asked for a night out in London with his wife Kelisha and son Zion. He loves architecture and she loves food. The Ting Shangri-La restaurant in the Shard skyscraper near London Bridge offered to host the family – but it’s on the 35th floor, and Bracewell is afraid of heights. “It’s all about conquering those fears,” he laughs. They spent quality time together for the first time in weeks. “I can only do what I do with my wife by my side,” says Bracewell. “So it was for both of us.” He particularly enjoyed seeing his baby in the Shard, looking down on the world below from on high – “that was amazing”.

1/1/2022,"Money plays a key role in many people’s new year’s resolutions to change their lifestyle, so we asked five people to tell us about their financial goals for 2022 and how they plan to achieve them. The rising cost of living and the uncertainty over the pandemic are just two of the challenges that people are having to deal with, so what are some of the things that individuals are planning to do differently this year?  Natalie Evans’s financial goal relates to 2020, when her life changed after she filmed a racist incident on a train. The video went viral and Natalie, 32, and her sister Naomi ended up setting up the Instagram account Everyday Racism to help educate people about the issue, teach them how to become anti-racist and offer resources they have created. After accruing 190,000 followers, it has become such a huge platform that last month Natalie quit her job at a youth charity, while Naomi went down to three days a week in her role as a teacher to focus on the account. To help her survive financially, Natalie’s focus for 2022 is to attract people to their newly set-up Patreon account, where people can donate to support their work on Instagram. Patreon is an online platform used by musicians, artists and others where people can fund someone’s creative work via monthly membership. “People kept telling us to set one up. I wasn’t sure but it takes time to write up resources and do the things we want to do, and we need support,” Natalie says. “It’s a great way of having a safety net.” The Patreon platform will enable the sisters to create more exclusive content. “It would be great if there was enough of an income from it for me, and then potentially for Naomi for the two days she’s working for Everyday Racism,” she says. Their Patreon membership has various tiers of access with different prices. Those signing up for the £3 a month tier receive a monthly newsletter plus resources, while a £10 subscription gives supporters access to a monthly Zoom Q&A focused on different topics. There are guest speakers and the chance to ask questions about anti-racism work and discuss current affairs with the sisters. As a result of quitting her job, Natalie says that another goal is to rein in her spending this year. “I’ve gone from a full-time wage to being freelance, so I need to cut down as much as I can in terms of personal spending. I’ll be cutting down on things like buying new clothes, meeting people for coffee, eating out and other subscription services.” Martin Hall, 25, has made a big commitment for 2022 – and beyond. The data engineer from Manchester has signed up to give away 10% of his income to charities for the rest of his working life. Hall has joined Giving What We Can, an organisation that encourages members to give 10% or more of their income to charities that have been found to have the most impact. It offers information to help members choose causes and organisations to donate to, and provides a list of charities it says are effective. A calculator on the site shows you how much impact your 10% donation could have. Everyone who has made the pledge – including Hall – is listed on the site, to encourage other people to add their name. “I’ve understood the arguments to do this for a while but now I feel like I’m at the point where I can commit,” says Hall, who will organise the payments directly from his bank account. “It feels like the right thing to do. I am fairly comfortable and my needs are met, so 10% doesn’t make much difference – a nicer car or more takeaways doesn’t make much difference to me, whereas the money could have a huge impact on someone else’s life. I’ll stick to the pledge through continued belief in the value of what I’m doing, budgeting, and having a wider community around me that have taken the same pledge.” Hall has picked six organisations – which he can change later – including the Global Health and Development Fund and GiveDirectly, a non-profit organisation that allows donors to send money directly to people in poverty with no strings attached. “It’s a nice balance of global health and development but also long-term solutions to reduce global catastrophes such as reducing the risk of human extinction,” he says. What did friends and family think of his pledge? “My parents said it was a good idea. But for me, it’s primarily a thing you do for yourself and decide on your own.” Giving What We Can is part of the Centre for Effective Altruism, a charity. After recently switching from being a sole trader to setting up a limited company and hiring her first employee, Leila Hrycyszyn, 32, says that this year she plans to be more rigorous with her finances and set aside money for her tax bill. “I’m usually frantically saving for my tax bill at the end of the year,” says the owner of a PR agency. “I often find I’ve spent most of the tax bill rather than putting money aside throughout the year. I need to manage my finances a lot better, so at the start of 2022 I’m planning to pay myself a salary and then put the rest in savings accounts for the tax bill. I know I need to deposit money into different accounts as, at the moment, everything goes out of the current account.” Hrycyszyn, who lives in Alton, Hampshire, says she has been focused on spending rather than saving during the past few months. “I plan to cut back and put some real plans in place, like monthly goals to stop my spending,” she says. To help her cut back, she plans to track her spending on a finance and spending calendar. “This will make me more mindful about what I’m buying and make me think twice about purchasing things in one click online.” She adds: “I’ll be thinking about whether it’s really an essential purchase or not, and if not, won’t buy it. I spend quite a lot on platforms like Asos’s Premier Delivery, and Amazon Prime. I need to stop thinking I need six different things today. I’m going to cut back as much as I can. I’ll be looking at subscriptions and whether I need them. I don’t think I’ll stop using Amazon – I find it incredibly useful but what I have done is removed the app from my homepage.” Looking ahead, she is feeling positive. “Marketing budgets have kicked off again and I’m the busiest I’ve ever been,” she says. “Even if there’s another lockdown, I don’t feel like budgets would go again like they did last time. I’m hoping the business will continue to thrive.” Tristan Verran, 49, a performer and educator living in Plymouth, wants to spend 2022 exploring alternative ways of transacting. For him, this means going against the cashless trajectory and paying more with notes and coins. “I like cash,” he says. “There’s no privacy issues. It’s not really traceable, there’s more anonymity with it, and it’s not micromanaged by some unseen AI somewhere.” “Although spending cash might be tough as more places are turning card-only, especially after the pandemic. I’m an academic and I deal with books but this is a social project I’d like to do. I know little in the way of finance but all I know is that it’s become clear that the global finance system is incapable of meeting the material needs of the majority and is instead committed to systemically transferring wealth upwards.” Verran is keen to explore negotiation and exchanging services, and see who is willing to participate. “I’m definitely going to step up and be more vigilant, and look at where things come from, and shop local more,” he says, adding: “I’ve started bartering. I taught someone’s kids in exchange for their parent sorting out the plumbing.” He says he would also like to look into creating a local version of the Bristol pound, the city currency that is in the process of transforming into a new scheme called Bristol Pay. “That model has been interesting. I’ve already started putting feelers out about creating something similar in Plymouth,” he says. “I want to invest in communities, not extracting wealth and giving it to some unseen billionaire to build spaceships. I’d like to push for that kind of model in Cornwall and possibly Devon. I just think what is happening right now isn’t working – we need different ways of doing stuff and exchanging services. We need more community engagement.” Verran hopes to knock £10,000 from his £27,000 student loan debt in the first six months of the year. “This is optimistic to manageable as I am seriously curtailing my weekly expenses on food and travel,” he says. “I will be baking more, and all bills are included in my studio, so I know exactly how much my monthly spend will be. However, [any] lockdowns are going to mean that I rely more heavily on online teaching. I will still be required to complete teaching courses online, so that money is guaranteed, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find new teaching work, or even venues to perform live. I’ll be performing outside with rural sites for free, regardless of lockdowns, and hoping to get some donations from patrons.” Verran expects to pay off about £1,500 to £2,000 a month from his student loans. A committed environmentalist, Alexis Bushnell, 33, is on a mission to make her finances green. After moving from northern France to St Athan, south of Cardiff, last year, Bushnell needed to open a bank account but, rather than choose one of the traditional high street banks, she opted to open one with Monzo. “The big banks are known for not being green, so I opened a business account with Monzo, but in 2022 I plan to open a savings account with Triodos Bank and spread my money between the two,” she says. “I like the fact that Triodos’s website is very upfront about the fact they care about people and the planet, and they’re clear about who they invest with.” Bushnell’s goal is to invest in a pension for the first time. “It’s incredibly difficult to live off a state pension, so it would be nice to have something to top it up with, so I know I’m not going to be working until I die. I don’t want to reach my late 50s and realise I don’t have any way to support myself outside the state pension.” Adhering to her strong principles, Bushnell is going to scout out an ethical pension provider to help her save for retirement. She says she will be seeking advice via Facebook groups for ethical business owners, and asking on Twitter and LinkedIn for recommendations from people who already have ethical pensions. “I’m looking for a pension provider that doesn’t invest in fossil fuels or things I’m morally opposed to, and isn’t helping to destroy the planet,” says Bushnell, whose company offers social media services. “I’m vegan, I buy from zero-waste shops, I don’t drive … I try to do everything from a personal level, which has a limited impact, but where I invest my money makes a bigger impact. Money talks.”",Lifestyle/Money,New year’s resolutions: ‘I’m going to give away 10% of my income’,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/01/new-year-resolutions-income-money-saving-charity
1/1/2022,"After more than a year of Covid cabin fever, the landscapes of the west called out to cooped up Americans, who arrived in greater numbers than ever before. As a result, 2021 saw bucket-list parks – including Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Zion, Arches, Canyonlands and Glacier – smash their previous visitation records. But the mass exodus into the outdoors has come at a cost. The 1960s-era wastewater system in Yellowstone was pushed to the brink. Arches temporarily closed 120 times because all the parking lots were full. The Grand Canyon struggled to cope with a record number of rescues, and an influx of remote workers have driven rents sky high in gateway towns such as Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  Interviews with park supervisors, staff and guests paint a picture of a system under increasing strain and struggling to adapt to this new reality. National parks have become the go-to destination for vacationers craving dazzling sights at a social distance, but the surge has collided with a host of existing problems on public lands, including years of underinvestment. That has left staff overwhelmed and guests frustrated. “The whole country had been pent up and everybody decided to come to the American west at the same time,” says Jason Williams, chair of the Jackson Hole chamber of commerce and owner of a wildlife tour company. “Last summer people were rolling into town without reservations or a plan but they had very high expectations.” Now that the chaotic tourism season is over, park superintendents are taking a deep breath and examining how Covid has changed America’s relationship to the outdoors. The record turnout has been a phenomenon largely affecting parks in the western US, and marks a shift from 2020, where people were more likely to visit parks closer to home. That changed when the relaxing of Covid restrictions made wild, celebrated landscapes more accessible, and park authorities say that will continue. For Chip Jenkins, the superintendent of Grand Teton, which saw a record 3.8 million visitors in 2021, that means balancing the benefits of more people heading outdoors with the logistical challenges of accommodating them. “I am thinking about what this means for 2022 but also for 2042,” says Jenkins. “How are we going to preserve a high-quality visitor experience?” Inspired by well-funded state tourism campaigns and an endless feed of beautiful photos on Instagram, Americans headed to crown jewel parks expecting a picture-postcard experience. But the upbeat marketing pitches glossed over the fact that Covid coincided with a period of chronic underfunding. According to the not-for-profit National Parks Conservation Association, National Park Service staff has shrunk by 14% over the last decade, primarily due to federal funding cuts. Total visitation to all national park properties has increased by 20% during the same period. Making the situation even more difficult were staff housing restrictions and supply chain problems created by Covid. While visitors would find the Tetons or Delicate Arch as spectacular as ever, they would also discover there were not enough park employees to shoulder the increased demand for basic services like cleaning bathrooms or answering questions at visitor centers. Tourists in gateway towns also encountered closed restaurants due to lack of staffing, empty store shelves caused by supply chain problems, hotels that were booked out for months, traffic jams and frazzled local residents. In Yellowstone – where visitation hit 4.4 million in 2021, a million more than in 2020 – the sudden influx created a kind of operational whiplash. “Historically, we had 20 years between each additional million visitors and there was plenty of time to adjust,” says Cam Sholly, Yellowstone’s superintendent. “But getting that increase in just a 12-month period made it hard to react fast enough.” Sholly says the primary impact of last year’s visitor increase was the extra stress placed on park infrastructure and staff rather than on the wild landscape. “All of a sudden we are having to clean the bathrooms five times a day instead of three,” he says. “And we are needing to empty 2,000 trash cans more often.” Supply chain problems caused food to run low at even the most highbrow Yellowstone restaurants and hotels. And staffing shortages often left dining rooms without enough servers. Chris Schultz and his wife visited the park’s Old Faithful Inn in late September. Given the hotel’s historic reputation and $500-a-night price tag, they had high expectations but came away disappointed. “The only thing you could get for breakfast was a cold bagel that was being served out of a cooler,” says Schultz, who lives in Tennessee. Yellowstone visitor activity traditionally tapers off in the fall when snow arrives, but last year the park set a September visitation record of more than 9,000 people. Park managers say attractions like Old Faithful and Mammoth Hot Springs are now just as packed in the fall as they are during summer. “Yellowstone reached the point several years ago where there are more visitors inside the park than there are services to accommodate them,” says Mike Keller, general manager for Yellowstone National Park Lodges. But Keller, who has worked at Yellowstone for 30 years, does not think adding more hotel rooms or camp grounds is going to solve the problem. He is more interested in educating new park visitors about how Yellowstone’s rustic atmosphere is very different from places like Disneyland – and he wants it to stay that way. “I saw more visitors come to Yellowstone who were unprepared for what the park experience is like,” he says. “We have never had TVs or swimming pools in our hotels. But there were so many times when guests would complain about it to our employees, saying they didn’t know what to do with their family at night. There was a real fatigue for staff caused by visitors wanting services that we don’t offer.” Park staff say a lack of preparedness, particularly among newcomers who may underestimate the extremes of these wild places, has driven up search and rescue costs and monopolized ranger time. In Grand Canyon national park, the strain of backcountry rescues has become especially acute. Though visitation decreased in 2021 due to a drop in international tourism, park rescues increased by 30% compared with the annual average. The park carried out at least 400 backcountry evacuations in 2021, the most in its history. The park informs people about the challenges of hiking in the canyon, where temperatures routinely climb into the triple digits and trails are relentlessly steep, but Grand Canyon superintendent Ed Keable says many of last year’s first-time visitors to the park did not heed those warnings. “They were underestimating the challenge and overestimating their physical abilities,” says Keable. “They were just so eager to get out and hike but they were not as fit as they had been before the pandemic.” While the rescue data from Grand Canyon and other parks show that the new visitors are often lacking in preparation or a sense of caution, they also share other characteristics, according to a recent study conducted by social scientists at the University of Montana, Penn State and the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics. The study surveyed nearly 5,000 adults across the United States during May and June 2021 to find out who was recreating outdoors during Covid. The results revealed a fairly homogeneous group: people who are predominantly white, middle aged and have slightly higher than average disposable incomes. “It turns out the new outdoor recreationists are not very different demographically from the existing recreationists,” says Peter Newman, a co-author of the study and a professor with Penn State’s department of recreation, park and tourism management. The survey found that 76% of the outdoor recreation newcomers were white; 73% of people who had been going outdoors before Covid were white. Meanwhile, people who had been recreating outdoors but dropped that activity during Covid were predominantly people of color and lower income. These demographics mirror a longstanding lack of diversity among national park visitors. According to a 2015 National Park Service report, only 20% of domestic national park visitors were people of color despite the fact they make up 40% of the US population. “The new visitors going to parks during the pandemic were people who had fewer constraints economically and more flexibility related to work,” adds Rice. Remote working has played a large role in bringing more people into gateway communities that surround national parks. Outdoor recreationists and wealthy families fleeing cities during the pandemic for scenic rural communities have sent rents spiking in destinations such as Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which is just outside Grand Teton and is near Yellowstone. Residents in Jackson Hole say that many of the houses in the 10,000 population town that had been rentals for service industry workers and ski bums have been bought to be torn down for new construction. The average price of a house in Jackson Hole is $2.5m, more than double what it was a decade ago, and rent for housing set aside for service industry workers over the summer started at $3,000 a month for a 400 sq ft apartment. The result is an inflated housing market that’s priced out longtime residents. “Tourism drives interest in Jackson Hole, and that interest drives real estate investment, which then raises the cost of living and changes the labor market entirely,” says Chris Dickey, who has lived in Jackson Hole for 17 years and owns a digital marketing agency. “People visit the area a few times and then decide they want to move here. There are plenty of people out there willing to pay $3m to $5m for a home in Jackson Hole, but the problem is that’s not a price locals can afford.” Dickey has observed that many new residents in Jackson Hole come from urban centers like San Francisco and New York City. They are tech executives, finance industry professionals and successful entrepreneurs. Dickey acknowledges that park visitors are an essential part of the thriving Jackson Hole economy but all the attention can also pose an existential threat. “The real problem is not the crowds or traffic but the loss of our community because no one can afford to live here any more,” he says. “That is the true cost of tourism.” Park leaders are hopeful that a watershed of new federal funding set aside for parks will at least begin to tackle some of these challenges. Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill includes $1.7bn for roads, bridges and other improvements inside national parks, while a bill currently under consideration in Congress contains a proposed $2.93m for National Park Service operations that would facilitate hiring more than 1,000 additional Park Service rangers and other employees, as well as funding for diversity and inclusion programs. “The politicians in DC now know the public really loves these places and wants more investment in them,” says Kristen Brengel, senior vice-president of government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association. As for managing crowding, parks that experienced the most congestion during Covid are looking at ways to require online reservations before arriving. Arches national park is implementing a timed entry system, while Zion will soon require permits for its popular day hike to Angels Landing. Online entry reservations that were implemented during 2020 at Rocky Mountain and Yosemite national parks as Covid precautions will probably stay in place. But national park advocates and managers worry that these systems could further alienate the people who are not visiting America’s crown jewels. “What park managers are doing to control impacts from increased visitation could make the parks less accessible to people of color or lower income,” says William Rice, a professor of outdoor recreation and wildland management at the University of Montana and a co-author of the study on Covid-era park visitation. Rice points out that problems with internet speeds, digital literacy and knowledge about new requirements can pose additional barriers for certain groups. For example, the primary National Park Service reservation site, Recreation.gov, is only in English. “Our research serves as a note of caution to land managers and the tourism community at large,” he says. “Covid had negative impacts on efforts to create a more inclusive outdoors. We need to figure out how to distribute our nation’s recreation resources more equitably.”",News/Environment,‘Everyone came at once’: America’s national parks reckon with record-smashing year,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/01/national-parks-us-tourism-crowds-busy
1/1/2022,"At times it is hard to remember that this is the electric winger’s first true taste of the Championship. Johnson, the son of the former Forest striker David, has lit up games with direct bursts forward, providing five assists and five goals this season, the first an equaliser at local rivals Derby. Johnson scored an 11-minute hat-trick on loan at Lincoln in League One last season and is primed to play a part in Wales’s play-off quest to reach Qatar 2022. He is not short of top-flight admirers but Forest are determined to keep the academy graduate.  It has been an incredible rise from eighth-tier Tooting & Mitcham United, where West Ham’s Michail Antonio started his career, to Middlesbrough, for whom he made his league debut in August after returning from a productive loan at Queen of the South. Jones, who once trialled at Charlton, bypassed the under-23s at Tooting to become a non-league regular at 18. At his best driving forward, he has developed the defensive side of his game playing as a right wing-back for Boro. Wanted on loan by League Two clubs in the summer, he is now at the heart of Boro’s push for the Premier League. Locals no doubt knew they were witnessing someone a bit special when he finished one season with 128 goals for Hessle Rangers in the Hull & District Youth League. Lewis-Potter joined his hometown club at 14, played for the under-23s at 17 and last season scored 15 times as Hull were promoted to the Championship. A winger who likes to dance off the left flank, he is quick and composed. At a time when Jarrod Bowen is drawing praise in high places, Hull have another tricky winger destined for big things. The defender has proven influential since impressing on his league debut in August in the Championship’s curtain-raiser, with Scott Parker entrusting him with being his first-choice left-back. This month Zemura, who spent three years at QPR, is set to represent Zimbabwe at the Africa Cup of Nations, three years on from working as a glass fitter after his release by Charlton. His biggest asset is surely his athleticism given the way he bounds up and down the flank. “It feels like my superpower,” he says. Socks rolled down towards his ankles, no wonder the midfielder has been labelled the “Guernsey Grealish”. “I try to model my game on him,” Scott says. He travelled from the Channel Islands to Southampton, who released him at 12, and then Bournemouth as a youngster but while at eighth-tier Guernsey FC, for whom he played regularly aged 16, he impressed Bristol City on a week’s trial, scoring a perfect hat-trick in an under-18s game. Made his Championship debut as a 17-year-old in April and he signed a new four-year contract in August, a month before his England Under-19s debut. Thrust into the heart of the Posh defence after promotion, the centre-back, who turned 18 in March, has admirably dealt with what Neil Warnock would term the “muck and nettles” of the Championship. Edwards, who signed from Barnet as a 17-year-old, impressed Darren Ferguson in pre-season and is developing all the time in a team fighting relegation, showing aggression and a touch of class, while the chairman, Darragh MacAnthony, has tipped him to reach the top flight. Made his England Under-19s debut in October. No player has more goal involvements in League One – 11 goals and seven assists across 21 games this season – and those numbers are even more impressive when considering he was on loan at sixth-tier Chippenham Town as recently as 2020. That summer a swerving strike for his hometown club, Swindon, in pre-season caught the eye of the then Newport manager, Michael Flynn, and the attacking midfielder has not looked back since. A specialist in the spectacular – long-range rockets and free-kicks are his forte – Twine, who wears the No 9 shirt at MK Dons, has added a poacher’s instinct to his palette. Such is the centre-back’s burgeoning reputation, a Barcelona scout paid Fleetwood a visit in October to cast an eye over the teenager. Hill made his first-team debut aged 16 against Blackpool who, along with Bolton, released him as a youngster. More than 50 senior appearances later, he is attracting interest from top-flight clubs. Lee Carsley, the England Under-21s manager, watched Hill against Wycombe to see how he would cope with the brawn of Adebayo Akinfenwa and was suitably impressed, calling him up to his squad in November. Hill, son of the former Bristol City full-back Matt, had to withdraw because of a knee injury, but more opportunities beckon. The academy graduate has enjoyed a breakthrough season under Lee Johnson, earning an England Under-20s call-up in November – alongside his club-mate Dennis Cirkin – after starring in midfield. His first professional goal, a delicious left-foot strike against Accrington from outside the box in September, provided a snapshot of his ability and craft. Sunderland view Neil as a future captain and he has already worn the armband in the EFL Trophy. “He’s got that lovely dribbling technique, a little bit like a young Paul Gascoigne,” says Johnson. Perhaps the pick of the bunch when it comes to the Dons’ exciting youngsters, the attacking midfielder has excelled since scoring on his league debut in March. The Dons’ head coach, Mark Robinson, who was formerly academy manager, has nurtured the development of the No 10, who started his career at Millwall. Assal, whose parents are Moroccan, has scored six goals in all competitions this season, impressing alongside Jack Rudoni, 20, Luke McCormick, 22, and the left-back Nesta Guinness-Walker, 22.",Sport/Football,From Assal to Zemura: 10 young Football League talents to watch in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/01/efl-ten-young-football-league-talents-to-watch-in-2022
1/1/2022,"New restrictions on freedom in England “must be an absolute last resort”, the health secretary has said. The record-breaking wave of the Omicron Covid variant will, however, “test the limits of finite NHS capacity even more than a typical winter”, Sajid Javid said, as hospital admissions in England climbed to their highest since last January.  Writing in the Daily Mail, Javid said England had “welcomed in 2022 with some of the least restrictive measures in Europe”, after the government decided against ramping up protective rules while the devolved countries opted for restrictions on nightclubs, hospitality and new year celebrations. “Curbs on our freedom must be an absolute last resort and the British people rightly expect us to do everything in our power to avert them,” Javid wrote. “Since I came into this role six months ago, I’ve also been acutely conscious of the enormous health, social and economic costs of lockdowns. “So I’ve been determined that we must give ourselves the best chance of living alongside the virus and avoiding strict measures in the future.” The health secretary did emphasise, however, that the time lag between infections and hospital admissions meant it was “inevitable that we will still see a big increase” in the number of Covid patients over the next month and warned that the pandemic was “still far from over”. A record 189,846 daily new Covid-19 cases were logged in the UK on Friday, according to the government. However, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a Cambridge University statistician and government adviser, said the actual number could be closer to half a million new infections a day in an “unprecedented wave”. Spiegelhalter, who is a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the UK’s daily Covid-19 cases could be closer to 500,000 as a result of the testing regime being overstretched and reinfections not being counted in the UK government data. “This is a huge, unprecedented wave of infection and very daunting,” he told the BBC, adding that deaths were “not yet going up” and that the country could be “fairly optimistic” about avoiding the kind of crisis seen during the last winter wave, which reached its peak in mid-January 2021. “It looks like we are going to have a huge wave of cases and that is going to cause big disruption, in hospitals, of course, and other services, but in terms of translating to the very serious outcomes, I think we can be fairly optimistic,” he said. “Things will get worse but it will be nothing like the previous waves.” Hospital admissions in England are currently higher than at any point since last January, with 2,370 people admitted to hospital with Covid-19 on 29 December, a 90% week-on-week increase. Reports have suggested that the government’s current work-from-home guidance in England may remain in place for most of January in a bid to slow the spread of the new variant. The Daily Telegraph reported that the guidance, which is in place as part of England’s plan B measures alongside mask mandates in many public places and mandatory Covid passes for large events, may be extended by another three weeks. Boris Johnson initially said he wanted the measures, which expire six weeks after implementation, lifted “no later than early January and possibly before”. A review of the restrictions is expected on or close to 4 January.",News/World news,"Further Covid restrictions in England would be ‘last resort’, says Sajid Javid",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/covid-restrictions-england-last-resort-sajid-javid
