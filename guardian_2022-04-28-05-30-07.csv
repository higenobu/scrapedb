The 33-year-old, from Padiham, was last spotted on Friday morning getting into a silver Ford Transit van in Todmorden Road, Burnley. Andrew Burfield, 50, of Todmorden Road, Burnley, is due to appear at Blackburn magistrates court on Thursday. Burfield was arrested for murder on Tuesday. More than 60 specialist search officers from four police forces began scouring a rural beauty spot in Lancashire on Tuesday as part of their investigation. The area of interest is the largest wooded area in the county, measuring more than 4.6 square miles, and is popular with walkers and cyclists. Lancashire police said: “Katie’s family have been made aware and continue to be supported by specially trained officers. “They pass on their thanks for all the well-wishing messages but have asked people to respect their privacy at this time.”",News/UK news,Katie Kenyon: man charged with murder of Burnley woman,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/27/katie-kenyon-man-charged-with-of-burnley-woman
4/28/2022,"NHL veteran Brandon Sutter says he is still suffering from symptoms of long Covid a year after he first contracted the virus and is unsure when he will be able to return to the ice. Sutter was one of 21 Vancouver Canucks players to catch Covid during an outbreak among the team in March 2021, before a vaccine for the virus was widely available in Canada. He recovered sufficiently to play towards the end of last season but during the summer of 2021 he experienced a raised heart rate and breathing difficulties that felt “like someone was sitting on my chest”. The 33-year-old’s symptoms were serious enough that he was unable to play when the season started in October but by last month he started to practice again. However, he soon suffered a setback and he has not skated since early April. Sending our love to Suttsy ♥️ pic.twitter.com/0BxiZS9OYN “Thought I was getting better after Christmas and started training again, started skating again and was kind of optimistic about returning at some point this season,” he told Sportsnet on Tuesday. “When I started skating more and ramping up my training to the level you’ve got to to be an athlete in this league, I just kind of went backwards a little bit. “I’m always hopeful to get back as soon as I can and doing all we can to correct it. It’s just been dealing with immune system stuff, which a lot of people who are going through it at home too, have had what they’re calling ‘long Covid’ stuff. It’s not a lot of fun.” One recent study suggested that long Covid is associated with more than 200 symptoms, from brain fog to heart palpitations, and experts are still struggling to come up with effective treatments. Another study, by the American Medical Association, estimated that up to 30% of people who catch catch the virus may show symptoms of long Covid after they have recovered from the initial infection. Sutter said the most frustrating aspect of his illness is being unsure when he will recover. “Being out all year like this, watching the guys, is tough,” he said. “I want to get back as soon as I can … You’re just waiting for answers. You break a bone, you have a broken leg or a knee problem, or a shoulder or something, you go ‘OK, we got six weeks, we got eight weeks, we got 10 weeks, and we’re back to normal.’ This has just been dragging on and dragging on.” Sutter said one consolation was having more time to spend with his family, after his wife Giselle gave birth to their third child last summer. “At least you go home to your family and I’ve been able to be around or our baby girl and our other two kids the whole time, so it’s been a bit of a blessing,” he said. Sutter was drafted in the first round of the NHL draft in 2007 and played for the Carolina Hurricanes and Pittsburgh Penguins before joining the Canucks in 2015.",Sport/Sport,NHL’s Brandon Sutter says long Covid has sidelined him for entire season,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/27/brandon-sutter-long-covid-nhl-ice-hockey-vancouver-canucks
4/28/2022,"Tammy Abraham has praised José Mourinho for breathing belief back into his game and described the Roma manager as “one of the best coaches on the planet”, as the Portuguese prepares to take charge of his first game in England since his sacking by Tottenham last year. Mourinho will attempt to guide the Serie A club to a first‑leg victory against his former protege, the Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers, in the Europa Conference League semi-finals. Abraham will hope to add to his 26-goal tally at the King Power Stadium on Thursday, when the Leicester striker Jamie Vardy could make his first start since sustaining a niggling knee injury last month. Abraham is the leading goalscorer in the competition and no Englishman has scored more goals this season. “José is for me one of the best coaches to walk on the planet; he knows how to really drive you,” he said. “This is what I needed. I needed someone who could push me and really drive me. He always wants more. For me and the players he is the perfect manager. “For me it was all about someone believing in me. Frank Lampard gave me a chance, he believed in me, showed real faith in me, and that’s when I was producing. “It is the same with the coach now. When you have belief from the manager, it makes you want to do the best you can. It is all about confidence really. Coming off the back of a difficult season at Chelsea where I wasn’t really playing games to coming here and shining again, it’s like a dream come true.” Mourinho conceded his sacking by Spurs six days before the Carabao Cup final last year was “quite unique but Mr Levy is a unique person in football”. Mourinho, who has twice won the Champions League, with Porto and Internazionale, said he does not look down on the inaugural Europa Conference League and is hungry to win a 26th title. “I see this as my competition right now,” said Mourinho, who was appointed last May. “That’s because I’m not in the Champions League or the Europa League, I’m in this and I’m in it to win. It’s my competition. We need to fight to the bitter end because we have suffered for this competition and dropped league points pursuing it.” Mourinho made Rodgers his youth team coach at Chelsea in 2004 and later promoted him to reserve team manager. The Leicester manager considers the Portuguese a mentor and “one of the greats of our generation” and said he has nothing to prove. “I’ll never forget what I gained from him as a young coach,” Rodgers said. “I studied him and watched him, and I was in pole position for that. That time at Chelsea was a really special period. He is one of the great managers, he has nothing to prove to anyone, he’s a winner and he’ll always be a winner. But he’ll always want to prove it to himself. I can’t speak any higher of him.” Jonny Evans is set to return to the Leicester defence after being rested after being rested for last Saturday’s stalemate against Aston Villa, and Boubakary Soumaré will also return to the squad. The return of Vardy, who played 20 minutes off the bench against Villa, is a major boost. “I am not sure [he could play 90 minutes] but he will be in the squad and that is a big plus for us,” Rodgers said. “He is a top player who has that streetwise element, cuteness and experience.”",Sport/Football,Abraham sings Mourinho’s praises as Roma prepare to take on Leicester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/27/tammy-abraham-jose-mourinho-leicester-roma-europa-conference-league
4/28/2022,"Step by step, the west’s war aims are expanding. What began as an effort to supply “defensive weapons” to Ukraine has evolved into an attempt to provide heavier weaponry. This week Germany and the UK agreed to supply armoured anti-aircraft artillery vehicles to keep Russia’s air force at bay. On Monday Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, said the west’s goal was to “weaken Russia” to the point where it could no longer invade or threaten its neighbours. A day later the British junior defence minister James Heappey said it would be “completely legitimate” for Ukraine to use western weapons to strike inside Russia if need be. These are different, more specific, statements, compared with some of the broad-brush rhetoric used in the early phase of the war when Russian forces were menacing Kyiv, and Ukraine’s crisis seemed existential. “Vladimir Putin’s act of aggression must fail and be seen to fail,” Boris Johnson wrote in March. It was a generalised observation by the British prime minister that tactfully avoided spelling out any specific outcome. Yet the language has toughened as the conflict has stalled. On the ground Russia’s well-telegraphed assault on the Donbas is still only gradually unfolding, with the gain of a handful of villages near Izyum, where the attempt to envelop Ukraine’s forces continues without any sign of a breakthrough, hindered by rainy weather, strong resistance and command and control problems. On the other hand, there is no sign yet that Kyiv’s forces can counterattack in the strength required to force Russia back in the Donbas or the south, where Russia said on Tuesday it had captured the entire Kherson region. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has seized on the slowly enhanced weapon supply to sound off. On Monday, Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said that Nato was “in essence … engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy” in an interview where he also warned of the risks of a third world war and even nuclear conflict. Nato is not at war with Russia, but it is hard not to conclude that the west is engaged in a proxy fight because of the ongoing arms supply. Nevertheless, western officials reject Lavrov’s proxy war description, because they do not want to lend legitimacy to any Russian reprisals beyond Ukraine’s territory. “There is a Russian narrative that this is a proxy war between Russia and Nato. It isn’t. We are supporting Ukraine in their self-defence,” said one official on Wednesday, partly in an attempt to clarify Heappey’s remarks about using western weapons in Russia itself. But given how much Russia is struggling militarily in Ukraine, the idea that Moscow could open a new front by, as Lavrov suggested, striking against weapons delivery in Nato countries, seems unlikely – not least because it would invite a western military response. Nuclear threats are also designed to intimidate, but there remains an irreducible risk that Putin would escalate further if he felt threatened. What is less certain is what the end state of the fighting will be. On Tuesday, Nikolai Patrushev, the powerful head of Russia’s security council, said “the result of the policy of the west and the Kyiv regime under its control can only be the disintegration of Ukraine into several states” in a Russian newspaper interview – arguably seeking to justify a de facto division of Ukraine along military frontlines. On Wednesday, western officials said they would like to see Ukraine restored to the boundaries existing before 24 February – the start of the Russian invasion – “as a minimum”. However, Ukraine is nowhere near being able to achieve such goals on the battlefield. A crucial period will come in the next month or so as the latest wave of western weapons, including US howitzers and German and British anti-aircraft systems, arrives. If that does not prove enough to change the military balance, the question will become how much more Britain and other Nato members are prepared to commit.",News/World news,Western war aims are growing.

4/28/2022,"Accusations of sexual misconduct levelled at Tim Westwood while he was working for the BBC have left the broadcaster facing yet another reckoning over whether its safeguarding and whistleblowing procedures are trusted by its staff. Out of the seven women who made claims about the DJ’s behaviour, five say it took place while Westwood was working for the national broadcaster. Although none of the allegations relate to incidents that took place on BBC premises, several women suggest the presenter used his position as the highly influential host of the Radio 1 Rap Show to approach them. Yet none of the individuals made a formal complaint to the broadcaster about his behaviour. As a result, just as BBC director general Tim Davie is trying to modernise the broadcaster, he once again finds himself having to look backwards. Uncomfortably for him, Davie was in charge of the BBC’s radio division between 2008 and 2012, when Westwood was coming to the end of a 20-year stint with the broadcaster – and when some of the alleged incidents took place. Speaking at a media conference on Wednesday, Davie said the BBC has not found any records of formal complaints about the presenter’s behaviour – although it is now urging anyone to come forward with their concerns. He said an issue with media organisations is the way that power can reside both with the senior executives and also with the on-air individuals who present the output: “All organisations have power residing in different places and there’s nothing worse in life than abuse of power.” Davie has already gained much experience of dealing with whistleblowing issues at the BBC, having briefly served as acting director general in 2012 during the crisis caused by the decision to cancel an investigation that could have exposed Jimmy Savile as one of Britain’s most prolific paedophiles. Last year, in the wake of the scandal over how Martin Bashir used doctored financial records to obtain an interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, he again emphasised a beefing-up of the corporation’s whistleblowing protections and pledged to create a work culture where staff felt able to formally register their concerns. The revelations of the investigation into Westwood’s behaviour also pose questions for commercial media company Global, which has provided Westwood with a show on its Capital Xtra for the last nine years. In 2020 the media company was approached about concerns raised by anonymous accounts on social media but – accompanied by denials from the presenter – backed him for another two years, before dropping the host on Wednesday. Westwood has strenuously denied all the allegations against him. A spokesperson for him said: “In a career that has spanned 40 years, there have never been any complaints made against him officially or unofficially. Tim Westwood strongly rejects all allegations of wrongdoing.”",News/Media,Tim Westwood sexual misconduct claims put BBC safeguarding under fresh scrutiny,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/27/tim-westwood-sexual-misconduct-claims-put-bbc-safeguarding-under-fresh-scrutiny
4/28/2022,"West Ham fans of a certain vintage get misty-eyed when they remember the last time they saw their side in a major European semi-final. The rain was incessant, the pitch a muddy mess and those who were there insist that Upton Park was packed three hours before kick-off, the atmosphere bubbling and the nervous tension rising as the crowd prepared to roar John Lyall’s side on against Eintracht Frankfurt 46 years ago. It was one of those wild East End nights, an occasion that has gone down in claret and blue folklore, and inevitably there have been plenty of references to it during the buildup to one of the biggest games in the club’s history. The boys of 1976 were at the training ground this week, regaling David Moyes with tales of their run to the final of the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1976, and there is a temptation to assume that victory is written in the stars given that Frankfurt again stand in West Ham’s way as they attempt to keep their European adventure going. This is a chance for the class of 2022 to write a new story. West Ham have attacked the Europa League with relish, and excitement levels are high before their semi-final. “I don’t think I’ve ever looked forward to a game so much,” Mark Noble said, capturing the mood before the first leg at the London Stadium on Thursday night. “Winning the competition would be life-changing for all these players, and also for a club and fanbase that has really stuck with their team.” Nobody needs to tell Noble how much this means to West Ham. The 34-year-old midfielder has seen it all since his debut 18 years ago and, although he pointed out that Frankfurt deserve respect after beating Barcelona in the last eight, he has been dreaming about closing his career by lifting the Europa League trophy in Sevilla next month. “I wouldn’t be disrespectful to Frankfurt,” Noble said. “But I would be lying if I said I don’t think about it.” Noble is desperate to go out on a high. He has not played in a better West Ham side. “Sometimes you get an incredible mix of talent, hard work, honesty,” the club captain said. “A group of players that have got no egos and work for each other. A manager who doesn’t let anything slide, who demands hard work. That’s worked. But we’ve also got some very, very good players.” West Ham are united. Noble praised Craig Dawson, an unfashionable defender who has excelled throughout this run, and he summed up the squad’s togetherness when the focus switched to Declan Rice, the talisman and midfield general. “Dec’s a better person than he is a player,” he said. “And we all know how good Dec is. He’s one of the best in the world.” West Ham will need a strong performance from Rice against Frankfurt. Injuries in central defence have given Moyes a headache. Angelo Ogbonna and Issa Diop are out, and Kurt Zouma has only a slight chance of being on the bench after stepping up his recovery on an ankle injury. It would be a huge boost if Zouma returns, although Moyes does not want to rush the Frenchman back before next week’s second leg. The likelihood is that West Ham will continue with a back three of Dawson, Aaron Cresswell and Ben Johnson, even if that means leaving out Pablo Fornals or Manuel Lanzini in attacking midfield and playing slightly more cautiously. Equally Moyes will know that West Ham, who defeated Sevilla in extra time in the last 16 and produced a stunning performance to win their quarter-final against Lyon, are capable of hurting Frankfurt. Oliver Glasner’s side, ninth in the Bundesliga, also have problems at the back. Evan Ndicka and Kristijan Jakic are suspended and regular watchers of Frankfurt are worried about them giving Jarrod Bowen too much space on the flanks. West Ham, who are strong at home, are entitled to feel optimistic. They have come so far and are three games away from Champions League qualification. “I was joking with the lads the other day,” said Noble, who has no intention of reversing his decision to retire. “I’d happily come and watch the Champions League games with the Europa League trophy on the next chair. But that is way down the line.” First they have to get past Frankfurt. History is on the line.",Sport/Football,West Ham dare to dream of European glory as Frankfurt come to town,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/27/west-ham-eintracht-frankfurt-europa-league-semi-final-preview
