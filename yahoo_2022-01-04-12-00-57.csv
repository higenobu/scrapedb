1/4/2022,"By Clare Jim HONG KONG (Reuters) -Cash-strapped property developer China Evergrande Group said on Monday it had been ordered to demolish 39 under-construction residential buildings on the resort island of Hainan, as its shares were suspended from trading. Evergrande is struggling to repay more than $300 billion in liabilities https://www.reuters.com/business/what-analysts-have-say-about-evergrande-default-risks-rise-2021-09-21, including nearly $20 billion of offshore bonds deemed in cross-default by ratings agencies last month after it missed payments. Once China's top-selling developer and now at the heart of an unprecedented liquidity squeeze in the property sector, Evergrande has been scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares to repay suppliers and creditors. The world's most indebted developer said late on Monday it had received an order from authorities at Danzhou city in Hainan province on Dec. 30 telling it to demolish 39 under-construction buildings at the Ocean Flower Island project. It did not disclose the reason for the demolition order. Reuters could not immediately reach the Hainan provincial authorities outside Asia business hours. Local media reported earlier the buildings - stretched over 435,000 square meters - needed to be demolished within 10 days for illegal construction and environmental violations. In a post on WeChat late on Monday, Evergrande said it had been rectifying the environmental issues since 2017. It told the project's homeowners that it had spent 81 billion yuan ($13 billion) in the past six years to build over 60,000 homes, and the demolition order would not affect the rest of the development. Ocean Flower Island is a mega resort development, comprising theme parks, convention centres and hotels. 'INSIDE INFORMATION' Evergrande's shares were suspended from trading earlier on Monday pending the release of ""inside information"", it said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing without elaborating. The developer missed new coupon payments worth $255 million due last Tuesday < VG162759965=>, though both have a 30-day grace period. As the list of Evergrande's unpaid creditors and suppliers continue to grow, the firm has set up a risk management committee with many members from state companies, and said it would actively engage with its creditors. On Friday, Evergrande dialled back plans to repay investors in its wealth management products, saying each investor could expect to receive 8,000 yuan ($1,257) per month as principal payment for three months irrespective of when the investment matures. ""The market is watching the asset disposal progress from Evergrande to repay its debt, but the process will take time,"" said Conita Hung, investment strategy director at Tiger Faith Asset Management. ""And the demolition order in Hainan will hurt the little homebuyer confidence (that) remained in the company."" Evergrande said last week 91.7% of its national projects have resumed construction. Many projects were halted after the developer failed to pay suppliers and contractors. Shares of Evergrande shed 89% last year, closing at HK$1.59 on Friday. Its electric vehicle unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group reversed early losses to rise 11% on Monday, while property management unit Evergrande Services also turned around from the red to rise 1%.

1/4/2022,"Rising prices and uncertainty about how long they’ll last are putting Americans in a bad mood. Inflation was worse than expected in November, with consumer prices soaring 6.8% from a year ago. That inflation rate was the steepest in more than 30 years, with gasoline, housing, food and cars leading the way. When prices began accelerating earlier this year, some experts, including the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" sounded the alarm. ""We are seeing substantial inflation,"" Warren Buffett told attendees at his Berkshire Hathaway company's annual shareholders meeting in May. ""We are raising prices. People are raising prices to us, and it's being accepted."" Here are eight strategies to help you worry less about the impact on your finances — or even help you come out ahead — while inflation flares. When inflation flares up, you can think of it in two basic ways. One is that prices are increasing, another is that the dollar is losing value. Either way you look at it, earning more money is a pretty safe solution. If you’re out of work or one of the millions of people leaving their jobs in the Great Resignation, consider using whatever extra downtime you have to develop your skill set and position yourself for a bigger paycheck. You can use those skills to start a freelance side hustle, or check out the latest job postings to land a new job with a larger salary and more opportunities to advance. Stocks have historically outperformed inflation to a significant degree, making them one of the strongest hedges against high-flying prices. You can use inflation to your advantage by investing in sectors of the economy that may benefit from rising prices, including food, technology, building materials and energy. Many innovative apps can help you invest in the market. Weigh the pros and cons of each, find the right one for your financial needs and get in the game. Fears of inflation usually bring new attention to hard assets such as gold and silver. Both commodities performed well over the past five years, with the value of gold rising by 52% over that span, and silver’s increasing by about 49%. You can hold precious metals directly by purchasing coins or bars, or you can take a more hands-off approach and invest in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that include commodities in their holdings but trade like stocks. One popular investing app can help you add gold or silver ETFs to your investments. Real estate has proven to be one of the most reliable long-term investment plays you can make. The U.S. housing market has been on a serious upward trajectory in recent years. If you’re ready to buy your first home, or already own a house and want to trade up, compare mortgage offers to find your best rate. Mortgage rates are still historically low — the average 30-year home loan recently fell below 3% again. The lowest mortgage rates tend to go to the borrowers with the highest credit scores, so do what you can to raise your credit score a few notches. When inflation heats up, interest rates often rise. If you’re carrying any adjustable-rate debt, like a credit card balance or home equity line of credit, an uptick in inflation will result in higher interest charges. That is especially true for mortgages. If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, you may want to talk to your lender about refinancing and opting for a fixed rate instead. That’ll guarantee that you’ll pay the same interest rate until you decide to sell your home — or refinance again at an even lower rate. If you’re carrying significant debt, but a mortgage refi or rate swap isn’t suitable for you, there are still options to reduce the interest you’re paying creditors. One proven method for slashing the cost of your debt is to take out a lower-interest debt consolidation loan. By rolling all of your high-interest debt into a single loan, it’ll be much easier to budget around a single payment to one lender rather than several. You've probably noticed by now that most of the suggestions here involve spending money. But cutting expenses is also an excellent hedge against inflation. If you haven’t checked insurance rates lately, there’s a good chance you’re paying more than you should. So do some comparison shopping, and you may find a better deal on your car insurance or save hundreds of dollars a year by uncovering a cheaper homeowners policy. And don’t turn up your nose at coupon clipping, because even Buffett famously does that. Next time you're shopping on the web, try a handy tool that scans the internet to find better online prices. Not everyone believes inflation’s recent spike is a sign of long-term problems. Warren Buffett has noted that Americans still have money to spend. ""People have money in their pocket, and they pay the higher prices,” he told his Berkshire Hathaway devotees in May. So if you’re comfortable enough with your current finances to absorb the higher prices, you may want to ignore the hype. And, generate some extra income in the stock market without much effort, by using a popular app that helps you invest your ""spare change"".

1/4/2022,"With the omicron variant continuing to surge across the country, it’s fair — and fairly depressing at this point — to wonder if the COVID-19 pandemic might weigh on the economy for yet another year. But it’s not a worry for America’s biggest bank. In a message shared recently with clients, JPMorgan Chase global research leader Marko Kolanovic says, ""Our view is that 2022 will be the year of a full global recovery, an end of the pandemic, and a return to normal economic and market conditions we had prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.” JPMorgan is forecasting strong consumer spending and the return of mobility, Kolanovic says. Put those things together and you’ve got a recipe for a serious bounceback in the travel industry. Here are three travel companies to watch. They’re already feeling the positive effects of people venturing away from home more, so 2022 should be brighter for their share prices if the rebound sticks. You may even be able to build a portfolio that includes some travel stocks like these using a few spare pennies. You might think that the pandemic would have annihilated a vacation rental company because so many people cut back on travel, but Airbnb’s stock managed to gain about 13% in 2021. There are several reasons why Airbnb remains attractive, even with omicron uncertainty hanging in the air. The Airbnb app remains a first option for many travelers who abandoned traditional hotels. If those travelers hope to avoid crowds, staying in an Airbnb provides more social distancing than a hotel. And once the pandemic has passed and rental demand in city centers returns, there will be no shortage of real estate investors fashioning apartments and condos into Airbnb rentals. The company just wrapped up the best quarter in its brief history. Q3 saw Airbnb rake in more than $2.2 billion in revenue, a 67% year-over-year increase. Net profits for the quarter were $834 million. Carnival, America’s largest cruise operator, has not fared as well as Airbnb. Since the start of January 2020, the cruise ship operator has seen its share price sink by about 50%. That’ll happen when numerous COVID outbreaks on boats have the world thinking your product is a floating germ lab. But the global cruise industry is alive and kicking. In December, 68 brands are set to operate 239 cruise ships, according to Cruise Industry News, which predicts major companies will be back to operating a large part of their fleets by early 2022. The rebound in demand has analysts forecasting a return to profitability for Carnival next year. That’ll be welcome news because 2021 has been awful. Carnival posted a net loss of $2 billion in the third quarter alone. But the company also had $7.8 billion in liquidity at the end of Q3, which the company says will be enough to return it to full operations. Booking Holdings is a lot more than just Booking.com. The company owns several popular travel fare aggregators, including Priceline, Agoda, Kayak, Cheapflights and even restaurant reservation platform OpenTable. In 2019, the last full year before the pandemic, consumers booked 845 million room nights, 77 million rental car days and 7 million airplane tickets through websites owned by Booking Holdings. With little opportunity for competitors to swoop in and absorb its market share in the last two years, the company stands to continue as a dominant player in the travel booking space. Booking is already reaping the benefits of rising demand from travelers. It brought in almost $4.7 billion in revenue in the third quarter, a 77% increase over the same period last year. Over the past year, Booking shares are up about 8%. Nothing against JPMorgan, but no one can truly predict what 2022 will mean for the stock market. A number of prominent investors have said it’s due for a historical correction. If you want to invest in something that avoids the queasy up-and-down of the stock market, it might be time to take a look at an overlooked asset: fine art. Contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years, according to the Citi Global Art Market chart. And it’s becoming a popular way to diversify because it’s a real physical asset with little correlation to the stock market. On a scale of -1 to +1, with 0 representing no link at all, Citi found the correlation between contemporary art and the S&P 500 was just 0.12. Investing in art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultrarich. But with a new investing platform, you can invest in iconic artworks, too, just like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates do. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.
