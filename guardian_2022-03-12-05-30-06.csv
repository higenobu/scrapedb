3/12/2022,"The owner of a US company that has sold ammunition online to numerous mass shooters has prompted outcry as he pursues a permanent position on Tennessee’s education board. Jordan Mollenhour, who was backed by the state’s Republican governor, was confirmed by the state’s Republican-led senate on Thursday morning by 26-6. He is the owner of Lucky Gunners, an online Knoxville-based ammunition company that he co-founded in 2009. Mollenhour has been serving as a member of the state’s board of education for district two since November, but needs approval from the state house and senate to make his appointment permanent. The House will vote on Mollenhour’s nomination on Monday. State school boards generally represent the public’s views on education, setting policies and goals as well as overseeing resources. His online profile states Mollenhour is “committed to serving Tennessee’s students, parents, teachers, and other stakeholders in an effort to improve the lives of all Tennesseans of all ages”. Mollenhour’s company has faced numerous lawsuits, including a currently active one that accuses it of negligently selling ammunition to a then 17-year-old who killed 10 people and injured 13 others at his high school in Santa Fe, Texas, in 2018. The victims argue that Lucky Gunner did not require the shooter to show any ID or submit proof of his age before he purchased over 100 rounds of ammunition from the website. “The shooter was apparently so confident Lucky Gunner wouldn’t check his age that he felt comfortable using his own name and address to illegally purchase the ammunition … in less than two minutes, Lucky Gunner approved his order, which was mailed to the shooter’s home two days later,” the plaintiffs allege. Mollenhour’s company denied any wrongdoing and argued that its owners were immune from the lawsuit under the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which forbids firearms and ammunition manufacturers and dealers from being held responsible when their products are used in criminal acts. In March 2021, a judge denied Lucky Gunner’s request to dismiss the case and ordered the lawsuit to proceed. Lucky Gunner was also sued in 2014 for selling 4,000 rounds of ammunition to the shooter who killed 12 people and injured 70 others in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado in 2012. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in 2015. Mollenhour’s proposed appointment to the education board has been met with fierce criticism from the state’s Democrats and the public. Jeff Yarbro, a Tennessee Democratic senator tweeted, “There are nearly 7 million people in Tennessee. Surely to God, @GovBillLee could have found one state board of education nominee who’s not in ongoing litigation about illegally selling ammunition used in a deadly school shooting.” Beth Joslin Roth, executive director at Safe Tennessee Project, a grassroots gun-control organization, said, “The man who sold ammo to the underage shooter who carried out the sixth deadliest shooting in US history is likely to be appointed to our state’s school board. This is so messed up. It’s disgusting.” Mollenhour pushed back against criticism, telling The Tennessean that gun-control groups are using his nomination to “attack the second amendment once again”. “I reached out to a number of today’s critics many weeks ago and offered to answer any questions,” he said, adding, “I didn’t get a single question which only confirms that their antics today have nothing to do with facts. It was political theatre.”",News/US news,Ammunition company owner’s run for state education board sparks outcry,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/11/ammunition-company-owner-jordan-mollenhour-education-board-tennessee
3/12/2022,"The senior Tory minister Penny Mordaunt has suggested her colleagues should stop taking funds from Alexander Temerko, a major party donor who described her as an “absolutely uncontrollable woman” and “threat to national security”. Mordaunt, a trade minister, said she had no issue with colleagues who have historically accepted money from Temerko but said everyone should be aware now how he has treated her. The row between Temerko and Mordaunt arose after the government blocked an application by his company, Aquind, to build a subsea electricity cable between France and the UK. Mordaunt, whose Portsmouth constituency would have been affected, campaigned against the £1.2bn project. Temerko last donated to the party last year but he has recently socialised with Conservatives, including having dinner with the former cabinet minister Jeremy Hunt this week, and meeting a cabinet minister in the House of Lords. Temerko is also a friend of Boris Johnson and is known to refer to him as Sasha, after Johnson’s real first name, Alexander. In a statement, Mordaunt said the party’s code of conduct “should apply to all members including donors”. She added: “Donating to a political party is a social good. It enables democracy and good things to happen in our communities. I know that the donor community feel doubly let down when someone does not abide by the behaviour we expect. “As an MP I am shocked that a party donor has threatened me just for doing my job and representing my constituents. His comments speak for themselves. Donors don’t control MPs. Donors don’t get to decide what MPs do or think.” “In the context of what is happening in Ukraine I want to make it clear my concerns about Mr Temerko have nothing to do with his heritage or former employment,” she added. “It has everything to do with his behaviour towards me and my constituents. “Nor do I have an issue with colleagues or associations who have historically accepted donations from him in good faith. They will have had no knowledge of these issues. But everyone does now.” She added: “Members of parliament should not be threatened. Our democracy should not be undermined. Bullies should not be tolerated.” Hunt told Business Insider, which first reported the row: “Alexander Temerko is a Ukrainian-born British businessman who has spent his life standing up to Putin and as such encountered considerable personal danger. It was a privilege to meet him yesterday to express my condolences over the family members he has just lost back home as a result of Putin’s evil war.” Temerko’s spokesperson has been approached for comment. Temerko made the comments about Mordaunt in January, when Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, ruled against the project, saying its “adverse effects weigh against the proposed development”. Together, Aquind and its co-owner Temerko have donated £1.1m to the Tory party, including contributions to 21 Tory MPs and ministers. In October, the Guardian and BBC reported that documents in the Pandora papers suggested Aquind’s majority owner, Viktor Fedotov, secretly co-owned a company once accused of participating in a massive embezzlement scheme in Russia. Lawyers for Fedotov and Aquind strongly denied all accusations of wrongdoing. The company has said it has operated in an open and transparent manner, saying its donations were “entirely lawful, properly declared and have not been made in return for any special treatment”. The Conservatives have also said all donations were legally and properly declared.",News/Politics,Penny Mordaunt suggests colleagues should not take funds from Tory donor,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/11/penny-mordaunt-suggests-colleagues-should-not-take-funds-tory-donor-alexander-temerko
3/12/2022,"My friend Joy Mitchell, who has died aged 88, was a committed Christian and socialist, and a lifelong campaigner for peace and against nuclear arms. Born in Lanchester, County Durham, she was the middle child of William Peacock, a coke drawer at Whinfield coke ovens, and his wife, Jane (nee Coulthard), who had been a teacher before she married. After attending grammar school, in the early 1950s Joy trained as a teacher at Bingley Teacher Training College and went to work at a primary school near Rowlands Gill in County Durham. From an early age she was a Christian activist and a member of Donald Soper’s radical Methodist Order of Christian Witness, giving speeches in public on the need for social reforms, pacifism, and non-violence as a way of life. She was also a lay preacher. In 1962 she married George Mitchell, a minister at the Presbyterian Church of England at Pelaw on Tyneside. They soon moved to to St Andrew’s church in Blackheath, south London, and and in 1973 to the Glasgow area, where George became minister of the West Parish Church of Scotland in Airdrie in 1976. Joy worked full-time as a minister’s wife, with all that that entailed. In the early 1980s she returned to full-time teaching at Willowbank School in Airdrie, and soon became its headteacher. In 1988 the couple bought a disused church, St Aidan’s, in Berwick-upon-Tweed, intending to create their own peace church, and Joy retired from teaching. When George died suddenly in 1989, at the age of 61, Joy decided to continue their joint work and the restoration of the church. There she held regular services, speaker meetings and coffee mornings, open to all, and gave shelter to homeless people. Friday meetings evolved into a socialist discussion and reading group covering topics from poetry to Islam, philosophy and the history of thought. Each month she convened a peace vigil. Meanwhile Joy attended anti-nuclear and anti-war demonstrations all over the country and was regularly arrested at protests. She was especially concerned with the transportation of nuclear warheads up the A1. More than 10 times she was arrested and fined, and once spent a week in Cornton Vale prison, Stirling, for blocking the naval base at Faslane. Expressing herself forcefully, fearlessly and controversially, she was fuelled by her determination and commitment to say what she saw was right. Joy continued to run the monthly peace vigil and the reading group, and to be an active member of the Berwick Trades Council. Until the last five years of her life she went to peace protests. At home in Ravensdowne, she enjoyed her wild flower garden, and her work at St Aidan’s continues under the stewardship of the St Aidan’s Arts Centre. She is survived by her two sons, Martin and Paul.",News/From the Guardian,Joy Mitchell obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2022/mar/11/joy-mitchell-obituary
