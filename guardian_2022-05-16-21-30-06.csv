5/16/2022,"When Emma Hayes walked into the press conference room after Chelsea’s 3-2 extra-time defeat of Manchester City in the FA Cup final, she had Ji So-yun’s shirt in her hands. It was signed ‘To Emma’ and the manager placed it on the table in front of her in tribute to her departing midfielder. The South Korean, who has been at the club for eight years and is one of Chelsea’s longest-serving players, has been telling Hayes she wants a statue. “I can’t give her a statue but I want her to know that I am honouring her in the best way I possibly can by putting her front and centre,” said an emotional Hayes. “If I could, I’d put Drew [Spence] and Jonna [Andersson] there, side by side. I think I realised today that they’re going, and I want to cry because I’m so gutted to lose three brilliant people.” Ji, 31, has been the fulcrum of the attack, helping the club to each of their 11 major trophies in the WSL era. Filling the hole is nigh-on impossible. Hayes said it was important not to even try to replace her like-for-like. However, part of the solution can be seen in the growing influence of the 23-year-old Erin Cuthbert. “Oh for sure she is [the future of Chelsea’s midfield]”, said Hayes. “And desperately needed too. We’ve lost Ji and Drew and Melanie Leupolz, who will be back, I might add, if she’s listening; she’s going to remind me that she’ll be back the minute that baby comes out.” Cuthbert has been a powerhouse in the closing stages of the season, shifting into a more central role after being the workhorse who would fill in wherever necessary. “Erin’s in her home,” said Hayes. “It was always going to be her home. We have a plan, we’ve always had a plan, to develop players. Look at Lauren James. She’s come into the club, people might say: ‘Why did she come to the club, she’s not playing?’ It’s not as simple as that. We’ve had to build Lauren up to be prepared for the future, just like Jessie Fleming, maybe Erin Cuthbert before that. “In our environment you need time to bed in. It’s a world-class environment, you’re not just going to get straight into the team and Erin [Hayes lets out a big sigh]: ‘Oh my God, can we make 20 of her?’ She is amazing. Absolutely amazing. I was going to say I wish she was English, but she won’t like me saying that.” The Scotland international has had to be patient but it is paying off. She scored to put Chelsea 2-1 up in the final and was named player of the match. “I was shocked – I thought it was going to Sam,” she said with a huge grin. “I’ve not let it sink in. I was too busy singing in the dressing room and my calves are about to fall off. “I feel like I’ve had to wait a wee while to get to where I finally am now, but patience is a virtue as they say,” she said, when told of her manager’s comments. “I want to learn; I know that I’ve got so much more to learn about the position. I’ve almost kind of just been thrown in there in the last few months of the season. I actually want to take the time in pre-season to fine-tune details, know when I can and can’t go. I’m an aggressive player but sometimes that’s to my detriment because I leave a lot of space behind me, so I’ve got a lot to learn and I’m glad that I’m finally able to practise my trade.” One thing she has been keen to add is goals. “Just hit it,” she said of her edge-of-the-box effort. “The first half I didn’t get high enough, I didn’t get around the second balls, didn’t get around the box. A couple of them dropped in the first half and I wasn’t in there, and the forwards gave me a hard time at half-time. So I made sure that I got myself up and Beth [England]’s set it beautifully. Just touch and strike, and if you don’t buy a ticket, you don’t win the raffle, eh?” What of filling Ji’s boots? “Oh, she’s just a magician. Every time I use one touch, she congratulates me. It’s like ‘small passes, small passes’, in training all the time. She’s been a great mentor. Ji So-yun is unbelievable because she can change a game just like that, and that’s something that I’m trying to learn to do.” What does the mentor think? “Erin said after the game the second goal was for me,” said Ji. “She has grown so much. She did really well today. “It’s difficult to express my feelings fully after my last Chelsea game. It’s a very special part of me and the past eight years means everything to me. It’s a very special club. It’s the best team in the world.”",Sport/Football,Chelsea say farewell to ‘magician’ Ji So-yun but their future is bright,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/chelsea-say-farewell-to-magician-ji-so-yun-future-is-bright-womens-football
5/16/2022,"When did you last eat? Did you “breakfast like a king” as the saying goes, or skip it to hit a 14-hour fast? While “good” and “bad” foods have been ingrained in us from an early age, there’s more to eating than simply what’s on our plates. “Timing is a crucial factor,” says Jeannette Hyde, nutritional therapist and author of The 10 Hour Diet. “Looking at the optimum times to eat can help your weight, but also brings down inflammation and helps you sleep better.” Intermittent fasting has rocketed in popularity over the years, from the 5:2 diet (where you eat normally for five days, and heavily restrict your calorie intake on the others) to aligning mealtimes with our circadian rhythms (the body’s internal clock) and time-restricted eating. It’s the latter Hyde has adopted, consuming food within a 10-hour time window and fasting for 14 hours overnight – “Some people will start at 8am and finish at 6pm, others start at 10am and finish at 8pm” – to improve her metabolism and gut health. Nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert, meanwhile, believes it’s more what you eat than when. “Your nutrition is so much more than a time schedule or a number [of meals],” she says. “The foods you choose to consume on a day-to-day basis will have a knock-on impact on your overall health.” A balanced plate, Lambert adds, should include a handful of carbs (rice, pasta, spelt, barley, for example), an outstretched handful of protein (chicken, salmon, pulses, tofu), two handfuls of veg (variety is good), and a thumb-sized portion of fat (olive oil for cooking), but how many meals you choose to eat, and their size, comes down to personal preference, lifestyle, and health goals. If, for example, someone had a body fat-loss goal and was more sedentary in the evening, Lambert suggests that a smaller portion at dinner than lunch would make sense. What we do know, according to Dr Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, is that the current NHS guidelines that you should be eating small meals often throughout the day is “completely disproven” now. “In general, snacking is bad because it produces extra sugar and fat peaks, and therefore leads to sugar dips and more hunger, so you’ll eat more at the next meal.” That said, a ZOE Health study, which asked a million people about their snacking habits, found snacking affected those on a good-quality diet less than those on a poor-quality diet. Snacking can, however, be useful for some, says nutritionist Jenna Hope. “If we go for long periods without eating, we are much more likely to overeat, and that’s because blood sugar levels fall, so we feel like we’re far hungrier than we are.” This can lead to eating more rapidly, too, so being mindful and observing the senses can be an important tool. “No one is going to make any money from telling people to slow down and chew their food properly,” says Hyde. “But if you sit at a table, without your phone or the TV on, be present and chew each mouthful, enjoy it, think of the flavours and texture, you will be in tune with your body and start to recognise when you’re full.” It takes about 20 minutes for those hunger hormones to switch on, Hyde adds, so take your time and you “won’t have room for that KitKat afterwards”. Then, consider the gap between your last bite and going to sleep. “You should stop eating around two hours before bed,” says Hope. If you don’t, the digestive tract is “working hard to metabolise your food and absorb nutrients rather than secreting and absorbing the sleep hormone, melatonin”. Varying lifestyles can, of course, make this difficult, something Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge, who lost 12 stone in five years, can relate to. “The kitchen is always the worst space because you’re surrounded by food, and you’re cooking at times when it’s been deemed lunch or dinner,” says Kerridge, who has restaurants in London, Manchester, and Marlow. “That’s part of the reason I got into a bad space in the first place, because you’re eating filling, naughty things late at night.” If you’re getting home late, and therefore don’t have that two-hour window before bed, Hope suggests a smaller, lighter dinner, such as an omelette or bean-based soup. Kerridge adds: “For me, it’s about trying to get a grip on the food I eat, rather than the time I eat it. You’ve got to look at it as a lifestyle choice that’s sustainable, rather than it being an instant return.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,How timing your meals right can benefit your health ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/16/how-timing-of-meals-can-benefit-health
5/16/2022,"Whenever I am in Spain and I see al ajillo on the menu, I always jump at it; I assume any slow-cooked sauce with olive oil, garlic and paprika must be good. In Mexico, an almost identical dressing uses guajillo chillies instead of paprika. The chillies, mild in heat and sweet in flavour, impart a beautiful, terracotta colour to garlicky oil, and I heartily recommend getting hold of some (they can easily be found online). Riccioli is a tight coil pasta shape that captures the crab sauce well, but fusilli works well, too.

Slice the garlic thinly and finely chop the parsley leaves, reserving the stems for a pesto or salsa. Put a large pan of water on to boil, add half a teaspoon of salt and, once boiling, add the pasta. Cook for as long as indicated on the packet, while you heat some pasta bowls. Heat a wide, deep saute pan on a medium heat and, after a few minutes, pour in the oil and warm it briefly (it should not be too hot, or you will burn the garlic and chillies). Add the garlic, cook for a minute, then stir in the chillies for a few minutes, until the garlic turns a pale tan colour. Now stir in the brown crab meat and parsley and keep stirring until the crab has disappeared into the oil to create a creamy sauce. Grate over the lemon zest and squeeze in half the lemon juice. Taste and season. By now the pasta should be al dente. Drain, reserving half a cup of the cooking water, and tip the pasta into the crab sauce along with half the white crab meat. Stir for a few minutes, adding enough of the cooking water to create a glossy, emulsified sauce. Split the pasta between the bowls and top with the rest of the white crab meat, a grind of black pepper, a slick of extra-virgin olive oil and a final squeeze of lemon. Eat immediately. Ditch the crab and instead make espinacas al ajillo by wilting some spinach into the garlic and chilli oil before tossing it through pasta. Add some toasted seeds for crunch.

5/16/2022,"‘Astory can be a weapon,” a character says with metatextual significance at one point in this historical, fact-based drama about the early days of the Arab-Israeli conflict, set in 1948. But Israeli director Avi Nesher seems to be also hoping that this story will be something more like a surgical suture, helping to heal a situation that’s one big mass of psychic wounds left by highly weaponised narratives about the past. It’s an idealistic if laudable goal, and Image of Victory sets out to heal by telling its story from many different sides. Nesher’s polyphonic strategy channels the voices of various Jewish characters living at the Nitzanim kibbutz near the Gaza Strip. Some of them are fervent Zionists, some traumatised Holocaust survivors, and some are more interested in the socialist, communal aspects of kibbutz life. This latter includes proto-feminist heroine Mira (Joy Rieger) who is up for a bit of free love (much to the chagrin of her nebbishy husband) and willing to fight in combat alongside the men. Crucially, however, Nesher gives near equal time to Egyptian characters, especially young journalist Hassanin (charismatic Amir Khoury) who sees being hired to shoot newsreel footage of the conflict as his ticket to becoming a film-maker. Other Egyptian characters are more motivated by revenge for the displaced Palestinian tenant farmers, and some just want to be involved in the adventure of a newly born war with little understanding of how ugly and violent it will soon get. A film that tries to empathise with everybody runs the risk of pleasing no one, and no doubt there will be viewers enraged by this or that detail or unspoken perspective, but the ambition is nevertheless pretty impressive and on the whole well executed. As a large ensemble drama, it is resolutely entertaining, especially in the scenes where the kibbutz men and women banter and tease each other. The orchestral score also has a lovely swell and sweep to it, reminiscent at times of Ennio Morricone’s compositions for Once Upon a Time in America.

5/16/2022,"Fashion elevated Glyn Philpot, but it also cast him aside. Before and after the first world war, Philpot painted the spirited lovelies – suited or skirted – of London’s high society. He died unexpectedly shortly before the next war. By the time the dust of that conflict settled, his silken party people looked outmoded, remnants of times past. Philpot had also turned his brush to more personal passions: the male body and portraits of Black men. It is these works that have stimulated the reappraisal of an artist who had long-since slipped out of view. Philpot was a prodigy, becoming the youngest Royal Academician of his generation. After close study of works by Diego Velázquez, and, later Édouard Manet, by the 1910s and 20s he was confecting flattering, somewhat old-fashioned likenesses. “Bright Young Thing” Loelia Ponsonby is seen awash in bias-cut satin, lush fur and gemstones. The Countess of Dalkeith stands out against darkness as a razor-cheeked waif in clouds of gauzy white, a woman less substantial than the fleshy magnolia flowers jabbing toward her. Philpot appears an artist – and a man – pulled in several directions. A practising Roman Catholic and gay, mesmerised by performance and masquerade, he allowed his interest in the male nude to play out in (at times awkward) symbolist works on classical themes. Influenced by developments in Paris and Berlin, in 1930 he experimented with modernism, painting the chrome, glass and glow of the transforming city. Indebted to Picasso, Cocteau and Matisse, Philpot’s new style was less appreciated in London. His interest in Black subjects was unusual for its time. Some were performers: Portrait of Paul Robeson as Othello (1930) was rediscovered during research for this exhibition (an earlier painting of the African American tenor Roland Hayes singing is still unaccounted for). In Paris, he painted two portraits of Julien Zaïre, a Martiniquan who performed in cabaret as Tom Whiskey. Positioned against the tubular furniture of a chic interior, Zaïre is the acme of handsome sophistication in black tie and pomade. Philpot’s favourite Black model was a Jamaican-born man named Henry Thomas. Thomas worked with Philpot for eight years, sitting for him until a few weeks before the artist’s death in 1937. At first he was paid a retainer: later he joined Philpot’s household in a combined role as model and servant. Philpot painted him in character as Balthazar (1929) and Harlequin (1937), and his body was used as an anonymous arrangement of limbs (male or female) in paintings of acrobats or classical subjects. He is also the subject of studies, drawings and paintings in his own right, sometimes named, though often not. Philpot paints him adoringly, relishing the particularity of his face. The elongated, statuesque Head of a Jamaican Man, Heroic Scale (Henry Thomas) (1937) brims with emotion. A profile against a red background is a glorious, richly coloured character study in which the contours of Thomas’s face are described in licks of deep rose and indigo. How should we now approach these paintings, in which the social and economic asymmetry between Philpot and Thomas is so uncomfortably evident – and suggestive of exploitative fetishisation of this Black man’s body? Cultural historian Kobena Mercer has suggested that Thomas may have had a different kind of power within this relationship: that of the elusive object of desire. “Philpot was undoubtedly attracted to Thomas’s blackness, yet the way in which he, as an artist, repeatedly returned to his favourite model suggests that Thomas’s beauty gave him, as a servant, a degree of power, too. Was there something in this interplay across racial lines that eluded capture, thus sparking off the artist’s quest to depict him again and again?” Thomas was not Philpot’s only long-term model. From 1924, a striking drawing in red chalk presents George Bridgman, a young Caucasian man with unruly red hair, a broken nose and an angular, heavy-boned face from which gaze eyes of otherworldly pallor. Philpot draws Bridgman as a malevolent beauty, mesmerised by both the face and the body. As with Thomas, Bridgman was paid a retainer and appears in many guises over 18 years: as working men in dramatic street scenes; acrobats clad in sheeny pink satin; stripped to the waist, hair tangled with vine leaves, as Dionysus in the high camp of transfiguration. This show is a passion project for Pallant House’s director, Simon Martin, who first saw one of Philpot’s paintings of Thomas as a student more than 20 years ago, and went on to write an MA thesis on the artist. Those decades of devotion are writ large in this exhibition, which allows us to rediscover Philpot in all his magpie complexity, and to afford his treatment of homoerotic subjects the honest appreciation they could not have received in his lifetime.

5/16/2022,"The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, vowed he would not allow threats from “terrorists” such as the alleged Buffalo shooter Payton Gendron to change the way he leads his life after reportedly being named on a list of enemies the suspect said he wanted dead. Gendron, 18, is accused of shooting dead 10 people at a supermarket in the US city on Saturday. Khan was reportedly described as a “Muslim invader” under a page entitled “kill high-profile enemies” in a 180-page “manifesto” published online by Gendron. Khan told the Guardian: “My heart goes out to those 10 families who are grieving. We know white supremacist terrorists want to divide communities, make us cower, make us not lead the pluralistic lives we lead. Diversity is a strength and I’m not going to allow terrorists like this man to change the way I lead my life. “But it’s really important that we as a city recognise that because of our pluralism, our diversity, our values we are a target for terrorists, in Buffalo or London – we’ve got to be vigilant, never complacent.” Asked if he felt safe in his role, Khan told the PA Media news agency: “It’s been on public record that I receive police protection. It’s unfortunate but it’s a fact of me being mayor. I’ve been incredibly safe because I’m looked after by dedicated, decent brave police officers.” In the “manifesto”, Khan is one of three high-profile men on the list, the other two being the businessman and philanthropist George Soros, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Elsewhere Gendron reportedly provided links to UK criminal cases including the Rotherham sex abuse scandal, and other cases including in Keighley, Rochdale, Peterborough and Telford. Responding to the shootings, Khan tweeted: “The thoughts and prayers of London are with the people of Buffalo and all the families who have lost loved ones in this dreadful attack. Our diversity is our strength. Hate will never win.” It is not the first time Rotherham and the London mayor have been cited in an attack. The rightwing Finsbury Park terrorist, Darren Osborne, jailed for 43 years for his murderous attack on Muslims at the north London mosque in London in 2017 when he drove a van into the crowd, referenced the Rotherham scandal, where defendants were mainly from Pakistani, and therefore Muslim, backgrounds. The note also railed against Khan. Brenton Tarrant, convicted of the 2019 Christchurch mass shooting at two mosques in New Zealand in which 51 people were killed, also named Khan in a 74-page manifesto. Khan already had round-the-clock close protection security from a team of about 15 specially trained officers and leaves home only with an armed guard. All his journeys have to be planned and agreed with police. He is the first London mayor to receive such intense security and has been a long-term hate figure for the extreme right. Sources with knowledge of his security arrangements said there had been no change since this weekend, in part because his security was already at a high level. Khan was first elected in 2016, and soon afterwards the Home Office ministerial liaison unit assessed him as facing sufficient threat to require armed protection from the police. Spats with the US president, Donald Trump, raised Khan’s profile, as did the terror attacks in 2017 on London, when Khan’s media profile increased. Having refused close protection security in 2016, he accepted it in 2017 as the scale of the threat kept escalating. There are also security measures at his home.",News/Politics,‘Diversity is a strength’: Sadiq Khan responds to Buffalo shooter’s threats,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/16/diversity-is-a-strength-sadiq-khan-responds-to-buffalo-shooters-threats
5/16/2022,"The average price of a litre of diesel has hit a high of just over £1.80 a litre – and could rise even further if the EU ban on Russian oil goes ahead. The RAC reported that the price a litre in the UK has outstripped the previous record of £1.79, set in March after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The amount paid on forecourts had dipped in the interim but began rising again in recent weeks as efforts to hit the Kremlin economically fed through into already high fuel prices. A full EU ban on Russian energy imports could push this even higher. High diesel prices are a warning sign for the economy as the fuel is typically used in vans and lorries owned by businesses, driving up their costs. The RAC said petrol prices were also rising – up 3p since the start of the month at 166.65p on average, a penny shy of the record high set in March. Campaigners said the price rises had rendered ineffective the 5p fuel duty cut announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in his spring statement in March. The RAC’s fuel spokesperson, Simon Williams, said: “Unfortunately, drivers with diesel vehicles need to brace themselves for yet more pain at the pumps. Had Mr Sunak reduced VAT to 15% as we call on him to do instead of cutting duty by 5p, drivers of diesel vehicles would be around 2p a litre better off, or £1 for every full tank. “As it is, drivers are still paying 27p VAT on petrol and 29p on diesel, which is just the same as before the spring statement.” Williams added: “While the wholesale price has eased in the last few days, this is likely to be temporary, especially if the EU agrees to ban imports of Russian oil.” EU diplomats are reportedly still aiming to agree a phased embargo on Russian oil this month. The Office for National Statistics said last week that prices at the pump were contributing to the cost of living crisis as it revealed that the UK’s economy shrank 0.1% in March.",News/Business,Average UK price of diesel hits record of more than £1.80 a litre,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/average-uk-price-of-diesel-hits-record-of-more-than-180-a-litre
5/16/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has defended spending taxpayer funds for projects in marginal seats – including those criticised by the auditor general - saying MPs have more idea about community needs than “public servants sitting in Canberra”. In an interview with ABC’s 7.30 on Monday, Morrison was asked to reflect on what he could have done differently including “when it came to the way your government used community sports grants as a slush fund to channel money to marginal seats?” Morrison said he rejected the charge, including for projects the subject of a scathing audit report that found half were not recommended by Sport Australia, with funding instead directed to marginal seats. “I don’t think public servants sitting in Canberra have a better idea of what people need in their communities than their members of parliament,” the prime minister said. “Elected leaders, ministers, ultimately make decisions. We’re the ones accountable to the public. Not public servants. Not Sport Australia.” Guardian Australia’s Pork-o-meter has found the Coalition has again made billions of dollars of commitments to marginal seat projects, promising about $3bn to its top 10 target seats. Morrison pointed to a recent commitment made by the Coalition in the seat of Bass, in northern Tasmania, for a bowling green upgrade as an example of a community project that needed government help. “We’re supporting them. Now, someone in Canberra may not understand how important that is. I can tell you what – they do, and Bridget Archer does, and I do. That’s why we support it.” “I don’t buy into this narrative that’s put to us. Politicians, members of parliament, are part of their local community, they know what their community needs.” Morrison was also pushed by host Leigh Sales about his assessment that he needed to be less of a “bulldozer”. She suggested voters were instead unhappy with him for “ducking responsibility, blame-shifting, being slippery with the truth [and] being slow to act when required”. “They’re Labor’s criticisms and that’s not what I get,” Morrison replied. “What I get is people really just want to see me be more inclusive in terms of how I go forward and that’s the challenge going forward.” When asked to respond to specific criticism of the government doing “too little, too late” during the bushfire and floods crises and the vaccine rollout, Morrison defended the government and said criticisms from the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, were those of an “armchair critic”. Sales also asked the prime minister for his opinion on why the government was struggling in so-called teal seats with MPs vulnerable “for the first time” – prompting Morrison to suggest the affluence of voters in these electorates was to blame. “Our members have done an extraordinary job there, but as time has gone on, many of these places, I suppose, are less vulnerable to the impacts of the economy than, say, many of the places I’ve been in this campaign,” Morrison said, pointing to the Ipswich-based seat of Blair in Queensland as an example, and “broader suburbs” throughout the country. “I mean, they’re places that cannot afford the sort of risk that comes with a Labor party and a leader that just is a bit loose on the economy. They will pay the price for that. “Perhaps some parts of our country may feel they’re a bit more insulated from the impacts of that and may be focusing on other issues.” On climate change, Morrison said that he did not accept that the net zero by 2050 target required Australia to shut down most of its coal-fired power stations by 2030, but refused to nominate a timetable. Morrison repeated his insistence that a vote for an independent would produce a “parliament of chaos” and would not be drawn on whether he would stand down to give a new leader a “clean slate” to negotiate in the event of a hung parliament. “I’m not speculating on these scenarios, Leigh. Because my scenario, the scenario that my team is working for, is not to have a weakened parliament, to not to have a government that has to negotiate for its existence every day.” Morrison also used the interview to spruik the government’s new super for housing policy, saying he rejected suggestions that the policy could expose people to risk if the property market crashed. The policy, unveiled at the Coalition launch on Sunday, allows first homebuyers access to up to $50,000 of retirement savings for a house purchase, prompting warnings that house prices could spike as a result. Sales asked Morrison what would happen to people’s retirement incomes if the housing market “tanked”. “What you are suggesting is owning your own home is a gamble that Australians shouldn’t take. I don’t agree with that,” Morrison said. “I believe that buying a home is the best economic decision you can make. It’s the strongest thing you can do for families and communities.”",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison defends marginal seat spending saying MPs ‘know what their community needs’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/scott-morrison-defends-marginal-seat-spending-saying-mps-know-what-their-community-needs

It has a theme, namely the role of anticoagulants in cardiovascular therapy; the even more interesting bit is that the puzzle was created for research into whether medical students found the subject “more enjoyable” when crosswords were involved, rather than looking at the puzzles’ effect on their brains. Naturally, they did: a reminder that you don’t need a pretext to puzzle. The enjoyment (along with the occcasional frustration) is the reward. In the meantime, let’s join in by making our next challenge a word that might be an answer in that niche puzzle: reader, how would you clue ANTICOAGULANT? Many thanks for your clues for DODDLE. The audacity award goes to Catarella for the impressively protracted “Three daughters, the first two claiming love, their father a king abdicating? That’s easy” and I enjoyed the collegiate chat around JasCanis’s apt “Minister cuts welfare as easy option”. The runners-up are Sheamlas’s not-unaudacious “One turning round in stiff breeze” and Lizard’s sly “Picnic party crowd ultimately led astray?”. The winner is Thepoisonedgift’s pleasingly revised “It’s easy to get led astray imbibing rum”. Kludos to Gift. Please leave entries for this fortnight’s competition – as well as your non-print finds and picks from the broadsheet cryptics – below. As often happens, we end with a clue in which most of the words appear to be doing something very different to their real intent. Nutmeg shows us her trademark sleight of hand in this clue … 24a Fluid feeder we left on patio ultimately getting drier (3,5)[ wordplay: synonym for “fluid feeder”, then WE (“we”) + abbrev. for “left” next to (“on”) last letter of “(“ultimately”) PATIO ][ TEAT, then WE + L next to O ][ definition: drier ] … for TEA TOWEL. Finally, a goodbye to the inimitable Shed. The Guardian archive has over 200 of his puzzles going back to 1999 (he first set for the paper in 1984) and I fondly recall this exchange in 2012: How do people respond when you tell them you’re a crossword setter?“A what?”And if you weren’t a crossword setter, what would you be?Even grumpier than I am.
