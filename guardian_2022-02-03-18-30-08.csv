2/3/2022,"When the world is in crisis, where should we look for comfort? Given humanity’s dwindling religious beliefs, we are less likely than previous generations to see our lives as part of a grand cosmic plan, or believe that paradise awaits in the great beyond. All of which can make consolation – the idea that there is a point to existence, and therefore to our tragedy and suffering – that much harder to find. In his new book of essays, the Booker prize-winning novelist, academic and erstwhile politician Michael Ignatieff examines the concept of solace over the centuries and how we might find it in our more secular age. “The challenge of consolation in our times,” he explains, “is to endure tragedy, even when we cannot hope to find a meaning for it, and to continue living in hope.” This is not a tract on how to improve your mental health or a guide to self-care. Rather, it’s a meditation on the nature of comfort, explored via a series of portraits of artists, writers and thinkers who have stood on the precipice of despair and sought consolation in difficult times.  In his preface, Ignatieff recalls visiting a friend who was bereft following the death of his wife. The writer’s impulse was to offer comfort but words were not enough to alleviate his friend’s suffering, and so they mostly sat in silence. “To understand consolation,” Ignatieff observes, “it is necessary to begin with the moments it is impossible.” He is dismissive of our present-day use of therapy and medication and believes that mental health professionals “treat our suffering as an illness from which we need to recover. Yet when suffering becomes understood as an illness with a cure, something is lost.” His assertion casually overlooks the fact that there are those for whom such treatments are life-changing and, in many cases, life-saving. To tackle human suffering, Ignatieff would rather go back in time and study the examples set by our predecessors, first of which is Job, on whom God inflicts multiple cruelties to test his devotion, from slaughtering his cows and burning down his house to giving him the plague. Ignatieff is not religious but does respect religious traditions and parables. From the trials of Job, he sees a man who keeps faith in the face of despair. Elsewhere, he looks at the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero who preached stoicism and self-control, and whose convictions were put to the test when his daughter, Tullia, died in childbirth. He also considers the art of El Greco, the music of Gustav Mahler, the letters of St Paul and the political convictions of Karl Marx. Like Max Weber, another case study here, Marx’s ideas were tethered not to a higher power but to the welfare of future generations. Ignatieff’s subjects are unapologetically high-minded – much as it could be fun to read him on the healing properties of Chic’s Good Times, or the films of Billy Wilder, popular culture doesn’t get a look-in, which is his prerogative. That the subjects are overwhelmingly white and male is more dispiriting, however. Just two women feature: the social worker and physician Cicely Saunders, who advocated for better end-of-life care and in 1967 founded St Christopher’s Hospice in London, gets a chapter to herself, while the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, writer of Requiem, about the Great Purge of 1937, gets a paltry three pages. Ignatieff makes clear that his choices are personal, though his approach seems strangely blinkered. It feels significant that this book was started long before the pandemic, at a time when ideas about consolation might not have seemed as vital as they do now. So will it bring solace to the anxious reader? Well, yes and no. In Ignatieff’s gallery of the broken and bereaved, there is no escaping the ultimate trajectory that we are all on. Grim anecdotes also abound, from Cicero’s grisly execution, which involved having his head and hands cut off, and his severed tongue being stabbed with needles by Mark Antony’s wife, Fulvia, to Michel de Montaigne watching plague-ridden peasants digging pits to die in. If you think we’ve got it bad, the author seems to say, try watching a sick man climbing into his own grave. But there are also lessons to be taken from those who have faced enormous hardship and emerged with a greater understanding of themselves and their place in the world. Ignatieff’s aim in telling these stories is to remind us that we are not the first generation to encounter despair and to search for pathways through it. “What do we learn that we can use in these times of darkness?” he asks. “Something very simple. We are not alone and never have been.”  On Consolation: Finding Solace in Dark Times is published by Metropolitan (£16.99).

2/3/2022,"Before the coronavirus pandemic swept through New York City like a foaming white storm surge in the spring of 2020 and irrevocably displaced the trajectory of her life, Hannah Davis was an expert in artificial intelligence and machine learning. She gave talks on her projects, which included working with a computer program that generated music from literature, at Ted conferences, technology expos, even the Library of Congress. Toward the end of March 2020, as the first wave was gathering speed and the number of new cases in the US was inching upward toward 20,000 a day, Davis was living in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn – an area that would become one of the hardest-hit communities in the borough. She was stocking up on supplies one final time at a local grocery store before sheltering in place when she believes she got infected with Covid-19.  In the days that followed, Davis, who is 33, experienced a debilitating array of symptoms that only partly matched the symptomatology broadcast by major media outlets and published by health agencies. While she registered a temperature of 100F and felt chills and fatigue, she was also experiencing headaches, tremors and neurological manifestations. When she traveled to a local emergency room, the doctor seemed to dismiss the non-respiratory symptoms she anxiously detailed, sending her home with a prescription for an albuterol inhaler. She scheduled a telehealth appointment with a neurologist to address her piercing headaches and the bewildering cognitive issues that were ravaging her productivity, but the physician suggested she was probably just suffering from symptoms of ADHD, which she’d been previously diagnosed with – which she found “really frustrating and concerning”. By 14 April, Davis had been sick for three weeks. By then, Covid-19 had become omnipresent, a second sun around which all our lives now orbited. The version of it Davis was experiencing, however, was completely absent from the sky. Scouring the web for anything that might validate her experience, she discovered an opinion article in the New York Times written by Fiona Lowenstein, titled We Need to Talk About What Coronavirus Recoveries Look Like. In it, Lowenstein recounted experiencing “fatigue, intense headaches, continued congestion, a sore throat, trouble focusing and short-term memory loss” a month out from her initial infection. The confusing constellation of symptoms, and the way they waxed, waned and evolved, looked all too familiar to Davis. She joined Lowenstein’s online support group for Covid-19 survivors, Body Politic. Visiting the group, which is hosted on Slack, was like walking into an overcrowded waiting room bustling with frightened patients whose escalating sense of internal crisis mirrored her own. Many were discussing everything the CDC, NIH, NIAID, CNN and Fox were not, including the unreliability of negative PCR tests and the lingering symptoms that were starting to look an awful lot like chronic illness. Though they had no way of knowing it at the time, members of the Body Politic were among the nation’s first “longhaulers” – and their condition was initially met with intense doubt from many. After all, the coronavirus was supposed to be a flu-like virus that subsided in a matter of days, with the worst cases lasting perhaps two weeks. Suffering from symptoms for longer was to be wading into uncharted territory, one that started evoking questions about stress, psychological health and personal credibility. On 24 April, Davis found herself on the “research group” channel of the Body Politic. The group was created by Gina Assaf, a technology consultant, and she and others discussed the possibility of putting together a structured survey. “I was very motivated by the idea that, if there was a reason we were still sick, then I could fix it,” Assaf said. Davis, who had experience in data analysis and machine learning, immediately volunteered to help glean the responses. Several other people, including Lisa McCorkell, a policy analyst, Hannah Wei, a product developer with experience in computer science, and Athena Akrami, a neuroscientist at University College London, also offered their respective expertise. After 12 days, Assaf closed the survey; by then, it had been filled out by 640 members. A deep trove of data now in hand, the fledgling research team went about analyzing it. Though it was never peer-reviewed and only included one traditional research scientist (Akrami), the report nevertheless featured a relatively sizable data set, sophisticated quantitative analysis, and a number of highly legible visualizations illuminating the group’s findings. The report offered a number of stark revelations: for one, it blew open the notion that that illness was limited to the respiratory system. It listed 62 self-reported symptoms, including not only chest tightness, dry cough and elevated temperature but also brain fog, concentration issues, memory loss, dizziness, insomnia and even seizures. Over 90% of the respondents had not yet fully recovered. The group also found that the participants had less than a one-in-five chance of making a recovery by day 50 of their illness. They wondered whether the report could influence a national conversation tucked snugly inside a familiar binary framework: life on one hand, and death on the other. The group – which by then had assumed the name Patient-Led Research Collaborative to reflect the history of patient participation in medical research – worked with Lowenstein and the Body Politic to put the report in front of journalists and patient organizations. On 13 May, two days after the report was released, the prominent journalist and HIV-Aids activist Ann Northrop mentioned it on her podcast, Gay USA. Later that month, the Atlantic science writer Ed Yong interviewed several members of the group for a piece he was putting together on longhaulers. The story, which was published in early June and would eventually be read over a million times, linked to the report and discussed its findings over several paragraphs. “They absolutely know more about this condition than academics do,” Yong told me. “I think they were asking interesting questions, they had a big data set. To this day, this is one of the only groups that has really tried to look at the arc of these symptoms over time.” But Yong also lamented the fact that members of the PLRC and other longhaulers were facing a steep uphill battle in convincing skeptics that their malady was real. “One of the central things about long Covid is that people are disbelieved,” Yong said. “They are told that their symptoms are in their heads, or that they’re just suffering from anxiety, that they’re going through psychosomatic stuff. It’s all the same attitude that people with ME/CFS and other similar illnesses have had to deal with for a long time.” Yong’s piece – part of the series that won him a 2021 Pulitzer prize in explanatory reporting – would prove to be a crucial spotlight. “From there, we started getting calls from the CDC and the NIH,” Davis recalled. Suddenly, the lines of communication with officials at America’s foremost health agencies were wide open, and the PLRC’s data ultimately “informed a lot of the early CDC documentation on post-Covid sequelae”, Davis said. When I spoke to Jennifer Chevinsky, an epidemic intelligence service officer with the CDC, she confirmed that her team consulted the PLRC while writing the interim guidance for post-Covid conditions. “Their work was used to better understand illness in patients that were younger and previously in good health,” she said. In early September 2020, the NIH’s director, Francis Collins, dedicated an entire blogpost to the “citizen scientists” of the PLRC who had published what he called the “first detailed patient survey” investigating long Covid. By the end of that summer, McCorkell recalled, they had “seats at tables that we previously did not have”. In April 2021, the UK’s Office for National Statistics put out data showing that over a million citizens were experiencing long Covid. And most of these cases were not mild, either. The report notes that “an estimated 674,000 people reported that their symptoms have negatively impacted on their ability to undertake their day-to-day activities”. Those are astonishing figures for a country whose population is slightly more than one-fifth of America’s, offering a sharp counterpoint to the notion that the vast majority of individuals make full, expedient recoveries from their bouts with the virus. (While it’s too early to tell whether the Omicron variant triggers long Covid in numbers equal to those of its predecessors, it’s all but certain that the total number of longhaulers will increase after the surge has subsided.) Discrediting uncommon conditions is hardly a phenomenon novel to the age of Covid. Multiple sclerosis has been around for hundreds of years – descriptions of the illness date back to the 14th century – and scientific research into it started at least as early as the 1860s, when Jean-Martin Charcot, who would come to be known as the father of neurology, first described “la sclérose en plaques” – sclerotic plaques, or lesions, in the brain and spinal cord. Nevertheless, for a century following Charcot’s revelations, women presenting with the classic symptoms of MS were often diagnosed with hysteria instead. Though MS is now estimated to be up to four times more prevalent among women than men, by the middle of the 20th century it was still being diagnosed equally among both genders. But while doctors were diagnosing men with a neurological disease in which the body’s own immune system attacks myelin (the protective sheath wrapped around nerve fibers), most of the women presenting with the same symptoms were understood to be suffering from a psychological malady that was somaticizing into a host of physical ills. It was a double-standard that flourished, at least in part, because the people who stood to lose the most from it had been stripped of their believability. They were, after all, deemed by their own physicians to be crazy. More recently, those suffering from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS – a condition I myself live with – have been subjected to similar misdiagnosing and psychologizing. The illness, despite thousands of scientific papers attesting to the biological validity of the condition, remains a Gordian knot for which no conclusive diagnostic markers exist. When it cropped up in the hundreds in several small communities in Lake Tahoe in the 1980s, it was widely mocked and summarily dismissed by the local media. For years, the mysterious, polarizing “Tahoe flu” was regarded by many doctors with cagey skepticism at best; at worst, they were convinced something bizarre and even untoward had happened in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, perhaps a modern episode of mass hysteria. “Young doctors in the 1980s were often advised by senior physicians not to become associated with an illness that didn’t yet have a scientific explanation, because their efforts to try to help their patients could be viewed by others doctors as quackery,” said Anthony Komaroff, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and one of the foremost experts on ME/CFS. According to Komaroff, “there is no longer a basis for being skeptical about whether there are underlying biological abnormalities in ME/CFS”. Those who remain wary of the illness, he believes, “simply have not read the published scientific literature on the subject”. Though the chapter largely faded into obscurity, it left an air of dubiousness wreathed around ME/CFS for decades: here was a condition with a strange, vaguely off-putting history, a phalanx of detractors, and patients whose credibility had been repeatedly called into question. Perhaps, many doctors seemed to conclude in the 1990s and 2000s, the best way to think about such a quagmire of a condition was to not think about it all – to steer clear of diagnosing it, and generally avoid the burden and stickiness of acknowledging its existence at all. The way physicians discuss relatively unknown, unestablished conditions can quickly become dyed into the wool, codified among general practitioners and specialists and understood as red flags delineating what conditions might not actually be biological illnesses at all – and therefore best avoided or referred to a psychiatrist. When presented with a condition they know little about or, worse, a cluster of symptoms they’ve never encountered before, many doctors have historically done one of two things. Either they’ve psychologized the malady, attributing it to a psychiatric cause – hysteria, conversion disorder, somatization – or they’ve assured the patient that there’s nothing actually wrong with them, and they just need to relax and rest. “A real thing that happens in medicine a lot of times is that when we don’t understand something,” said David Lee, an ER physician at NYU, “we just try to explain it away rather than accept that, ‘Hey, maybe we just don’t understand this.’” Or, as Harvard pulmonary physician Jason Maley put it, “I think that there’s definitely a risk, if there isn’t a rigorous description of a condition, for people to assume it’s not real, or it’s anxiety, or it’s not a big deal.” The term now routinely employed to describe this phenomenon is gaslighting. Physicians hold a great deal of authority in a society with a predominantly reverential stance toward them. In part because of their status, acquiescing to the limits of their knowledge is not a practice that comes naturally to most doctors. By telling patients that the physical symptoms they’re experiencing are conversions of their psychological ills, clinicians are effectively releasing themselves of their obligation to treat conditions with complicated etiologies. Instead, they’re passing the buck back on to the sufferer. That such a maneuver is destructive to the patient practically goes without saying. When a person is told that her pain, fatigue, visual disturbances or cognitive dysfunction is a manifestation of psychological illness, she is forced into a position of confusion, vulnerability and self-recrimination. “It causes trauma,” Davis said. “It causes medical PTSD.” After all, when patients are told that their symptoms either don’t exist or are all just the florid projections of a delusional mind, what are they supposed to do with that information? Referrals to psychiatrists notwithstanding, the practice creates a clinical dead-end, leaving patients with no coherent treatment plan and zero actionable steps to take toward their own recovery. It’s not just that a psychosomatic diagnosis is offensive to many people because of its troubled history and dismissive implications; it also discards them into medicine’s wastebasket. The downstream effects of medical gaslighting mean that legitimate biological diseases are marginalized, to the point where clinicians become wary of taking them too seriously for fear that the aura of skepticism that plagues the condition will come to stain them, too. It can take decades for sufferers to slough off the stigma – the effluvium of doubt, the condescension and contempt, the faint but unmistakable intimations of madness. This past August, I spent several days visiting Davis at her home in Brooklyn, in the borough’s industrial Gowanus neighborhood. Aside from two trips a week to grab groceries and run errands, daily walks, and the occasional get-together with a friend, Davis rarely leaves the two-bedroom apartment she shares with her partner, Myk Bilokonsky. The entrance, framed by two black bookcases lined with copies of authors ranging from Dostoyevsky and Joyce to Philip K Dick and Neil Gaiman, led into a modestly sized living room where tabletops were cluttered, variously, with plants, supplements, orange prescription bottles and the odd Rider Tarot deck. A thin, unaffected smile penciled over her fair-complexioned face, Davis greeted me in what I assumed were her pyjamas – she was barefoot, wearing a graphic tee and baggy cotton pants. It was an outfit she would wear different iterations of each day I visited her. Though a few symptoms had abated over the previous year, Davis was still grappling with debilitating cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, low-grade fever, and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, a condition that causes a person’s heart rate to spike when they stand up or walk around. Nearly a year and a half had passed since she first developed symptoms from the coronavirus, but she was nowhere closer to returning to her fulfilling career. “I miss it,” Davis said. “I haven’t admitted to myself that it’s over.” Although Davis is not paid in her capacity as one of the co-leads and co-founders of the PLRC, the position is, for all intents and purposes, her full-time job (to pay her bills, she relies on Bilokonsky, a computer programmer, and a few small stipends from her research work with other organizations). She and other members of the team have started publishing research in academic journals with increasing regularity – including a recent collaboration with the National Covid Cohort Collaborative – and are continuing to pursue projects that will progress through the traditional peer-review process. In addition to the data analysis she carries out for these research papers, Davis participates in several Zoom calls every single day. In the short time I visited her, she had calls with the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation; the World Health Organization; the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Council for Medical Specialty Societies, among others. Even though long Covid has stripped her of so much of her sharpness, energy and intellectual vibrancy, she quietly remains dedicated to furthering research on her condition. “I am walking around with a lot of grief,” Bilokonsky said during one afternoon conversation over mugs of black coffee. “I fundamentally see her as having lost a lot of her irreplaceable value, and that meant a lot to her. I see that her ongoing health problems are not resolving, and are possibly in some cases getting worse. And the result is that I’m trying to do my best in what I consider to be a pretty horrific situation.” The past year of research forms a picture of a condition that’s wreaking havoc on people’s functionality – think exhausted and enfeebled, housebound and sometimes bedbound – far away from the overburdened hospitals and jammed intensive care units that absorb so much media attention. But go online, and you will be witness to a theater of commiseration. One subreddit, r/covidlonghaulers, includes more than 23,000 members, many of whom appear to be living with families and social networks who meet their plight with emaciated smiles and flittering eyes, betraying bewilderment at why they can’t simply move on with their lives (as though chronic illness were a self-destructive act of volition). Others are sucked into the convolutions of the healthcare system, an unforgiving labyrinth of debt, dead-ends and doubt. As one user writes, “I’ve seen rheumatology and endocrinology with no answers. My PCP just recommends the ER for psych evals, he thinks it’s all mental.” On Facebook, meanwhile, the support groups are too numerous to count, and collectively feature hundreds if not thousands of new posts every day. In March 2021, Davis co-wrote an opinion piece with Fiona Lowenstein for the New York Times. “Long Covid is not a footnote to the pandemic or a curious human-interest story,” they declared, but rather “could be one of the largest mass disabling events in modern history”. In December of last year, the PLRC put out a second study on long Covid on the site medRxiv, which makes unpublished academic research available to the public (known as “preprint”, the paper would later go through the full peer-review process and be formally published in the Lancet’s open access clinical journal). The second paper is larger, deeper and more rigorous in almost every way. It analyzes survey responses from more than 3,700 participants representing 56 different countries. The PLRC paper does not purport to demonstrate that Covid-19 evolves into long Covid in a specific percentage of cases; it instead analyzes the insidious sprawl of sequelae associated with long Covid. Describing more than 200 symptoms affecting 10 organ systems, the paper serves as a floor-to-ceiling window into what it actually means to be living with the amorphous syndrome. Two months after its publication, in February Frances Collins, NIH director, directly referenced the study in an announcement that Congress had approved $1.15bn in funding for research “into the prolonged health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection”. Despite the spate of new studies and grim boom of support groups, there remains a contingent of Americans highly dubious of the condition. In an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal published in March of 2021, psychiatrist Jeremy Devine argued that the symptoms of long Covid can be “psychologically generated or caused by a physical illness unrelated to the prior infection”. The condition, he alleged, “is largely an invention of vocal patient activist groups. Legitimizing it with generous funding risks worsening the symptoms the NIH is hoping to treat.” Another opinion article, published in the New York Times in August and co-authored by physicians affiliated with Harvard Medical School and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, respectively, assumed a similarly critical – though slightly more nuanced – stance. “Long Covid has come to mean different things in different contexts and to different people,” they wrote. “Psychosocial strain could be one contributing factor, particularly in light of the sharp increase in psychological distress amid the tragedy of the pandemic.” While Devine is ascribing something almost conspiratorial to the PLRC and the Body Politic, suggesting that they’re beguiling followers by offering an “attractive alternative” to the mental health issues they’re actually facing, Adam Gaffney and Zachary Berger, who authored the Times article, construe long Covid as more of a conflation of multiple psychological and physical ills. In both cases, though, we see the latest permutations of a longstanding insistence that complex biological syndromes are partially or completely “psychosomatic-symptom disorders”, as Devine put it. Yochai Re’em, a psychiatry resident at New York-Presbyterian hospital, says that “part of the urge to reject the notion that there is something called long Covid comes from the fact that many of the patients either are untested, or tested negative, and as a result there’s no objective sign that they actually experienced a Covid illness”. But, he added, the consistency in the symptom presentation of long Covid makes a psychosomatic diagnosis unlikely. “There are situations where people have some type of unresolved psychological conflict that then presents with physical symptoms. But usually that is such a unique individual process, and there aren’t unifying themes when a whole group of people presents that way. In other words, all the patients would present with symptoms that are very different. But in long Covid, there are common themes.” The PLRC itself has faced scathing skepticism. After the organization put out its second paper, a small but highly vocal group of detractors emerged almost immediately. After a link to the paper was approvingly retweeted by Eric Topol, a renowned cardiologist and the founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, several prominent medical personages voiced more disparaging views. Francois Balloux, a geneticist at University College London, tweeted that the preprint was “Mickey Mouse science at best”, presumably a shot – at least in part – at the fact that most of the co-authors were relatively young and unaffiliated with major research institutions (his tweet was later deleted). Gaffney, who more recently co-wrote the New York Times opinion piece, declared, “the ‘long Covid’ narrative needs revision, rapidly,” while questioning the fact that the majority of the study participants had either a negative PCR test or had never taken a test at all. Of the 3,762 participants, 2,742, or 70%, never received a positive test, a phenomenon that could be explained by the lack of testing availability and the prevalence of false negatives ranging from 1 to 30% in early 2020. (The paper demonstrated that there was no significant difference in symptoms between those who tested positive and those who tested negative or were not tested at all.) The first few detractors might have been more focused on the research methodology, but what succeeded them were anonymous attacks from agitators perturbed by the existence of an unabashedly vocal research group constituted entirely of female longhaulers. “It was just a shitshow for I don’t even remember how long,” Davis said. At one point, Davis received a dyspeptic, borderline deranged email divulging personal information about her – including her middle name – that she’d never put online. “There is nothing more obvious than the fact that you have Munchausen syndrome,” the message read. “Your symptoms are made up and are mentally ill derived! If you don’t stop this behavior in a very reasonable amount of time then I’m going to have you committed to a mental institution.” Others were drawn to invoking irrepressible old tropes about the chronically ill, including accusing Davis and the PLRC of seeking to profit from a fictitious condition. “Long Covid is a scam just like Lyme, chronic fatigue, adrenal fatigue,” one tweet read. “Grifters are pushing this and millions of dollars will be made.” During the demoralizing weeks-long conflagration, Davis and her colleagues learned that there are people who were angry, even personally offended that they were sick – a kind of medical gaslighting by way of internet mob mentality. It’s difficult to say what advantages a culture of illness denialism provides to society at large – perhaps the obfuscation of vexing truths that complicate the borders between what Susan Sontag famously termed the kingdom of the well and the kingdom of the sick. The PLRC, though, has aspired to serve as a forceful corrective to this enduring impulse. Helen Burstin, the CEO of an organization that represents 45 physician groups comprising more than 800,000 doctors across the US, said that without them, “we would have not learned as much about the symptomatology of long Covid as soon”. Ziyad Al-Aly, an epidemiologist at the VA studying long Covid, is more forthright. “When the history of medicine is going to write about this pandemic,” he said, “they’re going to be seen as really an essential piece that galvanized awareness that long Covid exists.” On a Wednesday morning in August, I met Davis at her apartment to listen in on a Zoom call she was having with Zero Covid Thailand. The small organization had seen PLRC’s research and was working on raising awareness about long Covid in its own country, which had scarcely acknowledged the condition. “Your paper is very famous,” a young man who introduced himself as Lin told her. “We really, really appreciate the amount of work that you and PLRC and Body Politic have put into making, not just long Covid, but the patient perspective on long Covid heard.” It occurred to me that there was a chance the PLRC’s paper was the only published research on long Covid that they’d been exposed to at all. In Thailand, they told Davis, all the focus was on keeping the infection numbers low and battling mortality. Morbidity was rarely if ever addressed. As barbed and contentious a subject as long Covid could be in the United States, in other parts of the world its level of recognition was absolutely nil. A young woman whose Zoom screen read “Benz” spoke up. She’d gotten Covid about a month ago, had rested during a two-week self-quarantine, but was finding herself struggling to return to full strength. “I realized my recovery is not the same as getting the flu and recovering,” she said. A longtime practitioner of Ashtanga yoga, she now felt depleted and dazed after just 30 minutes of training. “It’s like I lost four years of practice,” she observed. “I really think this is kind of like a long Covid-ish situation for me, but I don’t know how to deal with it yet.” The expression on Davis’s face shifted, just slightly, her brows furrowing and her gaze long and full as she considered the prospect of another person becoming disabled by the condition that had so dramatically truncated the bandwidth of her own life. She told Benz to practice pacing herself as often as she could, not force herself to exercise if her body was responding poorly to it, and join Body Politic as soon as she was able to. “I feel like I’ve been sick long enough where it’s very hard to hear,” she told me after the call. “I think it needs to get to a point where it’s recognizable by people, and people aren’t suffering in the dark like this.”",News/Society,The great gaslighting: how Covid longhaulers are still fighting for recognition,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/03/long-covid-fight-recognition-gaslighting-pandemic
2/3/2022,"For two and a half years, it was like waiting for Godot. But the levelling up white paper is finally here. So was it worth the wait? First, the good points: the plan’s ambitions are clear, and there are things to praise within it. For one, the notable shift of focus to improving living standards rather than simply targeting growth. Legally binding “missions” to improve wellbeing across the country, close the gap in healthy life expectancy, narrow the attainment gap and boost wages and jobs are all a step forward. They show that the government has finally understood that its previous strategy of pursuing growth above all else failed to improve the lives and livelihoods of people in the country that most needed it.  Equally important are plans to create regional mayors across the country with new powers to deliver economic change. But full details on what powers will actually be devolved are glaringly absent. And that is the problem with the white paper: the ambition is clear, but how the government will deliver on its promise to close the divide is still unclear. Over 300 pages of policies cobbled together from across Whitehall that do more of the same simply won’t cut it. Recycled infrastructure spending, innovation hubs, and high street task forces are all well and good, but they simply repeat the old remedies that successive governments have tried and failed to close the divide. The bottom line is that levelling up simply won’t happen without a major shift in policy. For us at the New Economics Foundation, this must start with the devolution revolution that Michael Gove has promised. But rather than ad hoc devolution deals and centrally controlled funding pots for new schemes, we need a radical transfer of powers over transport, housing, skills, employment support, business support, climate change and local taxation from Whitehall to town halls. The challenges faced in Bradford or Manchester are different to those faced in Darlington or Barnsley. Pushing control over money and economic decisions to leaders that know their patch is the first step to levelling up. Local power and control must be matched by a big injection of investment into our communities. The government simply cannot level up on the cheap, especially after a decade of cuts to council budgets. Why not create a £15bn social infrastructure fund to plough much-needed investment into public services and local facilities that people depend on? Or bring together the government’s goal of net zero and levelling up? We know that there is no path to net zero without public investment. So why not invest £28bn a year into our communities to create green jobs, boost green industries and remake places? This would create a much-needed stimulus to local economies and enable places to revive their communities as they rapidly decarbonise. There must also be a new focus on boosting incomes and creating good jobs in the parts of the economy that are often overlooked but form the backbone of local economies. Sectors such as retail, hospitality and care exist in every place, and make up 63% of all jobs. An uplift to the national living wage to reflect the true cost of living, for instance, would push up wages in these low-paid sectors and put money into the local economy. Equally important will be a new focus on small and medium-sized enterprises that account for over half of the jobs created across the country and almost two-thirds of private sector jobs in the north-east and north-west. Access to finance, targeted business support and affordable rents will be key. There is no silver bullet to a problem that is as complex and difficult as closing the divide between people and places. But as real incomes in London have grown by £600 a year since 2019, compared to £90 in Yorkshire and Humber and £20 in the north-east, the country is being torn apart. The government must now shift from laudable pledges to action. Without a major shift in policy, levelling up will continue to elude it.

2/3/2022,"At the beginning of the year, Israel’s foreign minister Yair Lapid reflected on the diplomatic challenges for 2022. “We think that in the coming year, there will be debate that is unprecedented in its venom and in its radioactivity around the words ‘Israel as an apartheid state’,” he told Israeli journalists. “In 2022, it will be a tangible threat.”  Lapid pointed to two United Nations investigations he said were likely to conclude that Israel’s governance of occupied Palestinian territory amounts to the crime of apartheid under international law. Several Israeli and international human rights organisations have reached exactly that view, including Amnesty International with the release of a report this week, Israel’s Apartheid Against Palestinians: a Cruel System of Domination and a Crime Against umanity. Israel is also facing an international criminal court investigation into actions in the occupied territories, such as the confiscation of Palestinian land to build Jewish settlements, that Amnesty International and others have said breach international laws against apartheid. But Israel is also concerned that the breaking of the longstanding taboo in the US on comparing its rule over the Palestinians to white South Africa’s racist repression of its black population is evidence of a slower-moving – but potentially more dangerous –threat: the fracturing of once rock-solid backing for Israel within its most important ally. The Israeli foreign ministry’s director general, Alon Ushpiz, placed protecting longstanding bipartisan support for the Jewish state in the US at the top of a list of Israel’s diplomatic priorities this year as opinion polls show eroding support among Democrats, in part driven by changing narratives about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For years, polls showed that Democrats sympathised with the Israelis at twice the rate of support for the Palestinians. But since the Israeli assault on Gaza in 2014, backing for the Jewish state has fallen and support is now about evenly divided. That change is accentuated among younger Americans, with adults under 35 far less well-disposed towards Israel than older generations. A separate survey last June found that half of Democrats want Washington to shift policy toward more support for the Palestinians. Support for Israeli government policies is even falling within the US Jewish community, with a poll last year finding that 25% of American Jews agreed that “Israel is an apartheid state”. There is little evidence that Washington’s backing for Israel, including the largest amount of (mostly military) US aid given to any country, is in any immediate danger. But pro-Israel groups are increasingly concerned at the diminishing effectiveness of their attempts to portray the Jewish state as yearning for peace but confronted by Palestinian terrorism. That claim has increasingly been challenged by what Americans can now see on social media, particularly video of Israeli attacks and maltreatment of Palestinians. Israel’s 2014 assault on Gaza – when it killed more than 2,000 Palestinians and destroyed schools and homes in response to Hamas rocket attacks that killed three Israeli teenagers – helped solidify the view of an all-powerful state unleashing destruction against a largely defenceless population. The rise of Black Lives Matter has fuelled the drive to frame the Palestinian cause as a civil rights issue of resistance to Israeli domination. “People can see for themselves what’s happening in a way they didn’t before,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, the former director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East division who worked on the group’s report, A Threshold Crossed, Israeli Authorities and the Crimes of Apartheid and Persecution. “It’s made it harder, particularly in the United States, for the emotional defenders of Israel, who’ve had this mythology about Israel and the kibbutz and sowing the land and this sort of fantasy of what Israel’s like, confronted with the reality of what they see in front of their faces.” Israel’s attempts to push back against the shifting narrative have been undermined by its own actions, including the passing of the “nation state” law in 2018 which enshrined Jewish supremacy over the country’s Arab citizens. Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, and members of his cabinet have a long history of opposition to a Palestinian state. Israel can still count on solid support at the top of the American power structure. But Democratic sympathies were not strengthened by Israel’s former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was openly hostile to President Barack Obama while publicly aligning with the Republican leadership in Congress. His embrace of Trump’s “peace plan” two years ago further alienated some Democrats who denounced it as a smokescreen for Israeli annexation in the West Bank that would create Palestinian enclaves reminiscent of “Bantustan”, black homelands in South Africa. Daniel Seidemann, an Israeli lawyer who has spent decades exposing Israel’s land grab and settlement policy in occupied East Jerusalem, recently travelled to Washington to gauge Israel policy. “The sands are shifting in the United States, in the Congress, in public opinion, and in the American Jewish community, and the apartheid discourse is part of it. There is a centre but that centre is not going to hold,” he said. “Increasing numbers of people abroad are beginning to see Israel as an apartheid state and a pariah state, and Israelis are increasingly fearing that.”",News/World news,‘Apartheid state’: Israel’s fears over image in US are coming to pass,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/israel-apartheid-us-image
2/3/2022,"Fifa’s plans for a biennial World Cup have come under a coordinated ambush from International Olympic Committee members in Beijing, with one warning it would create “immeasurable damage” to global sport. Three delegates in a row at the 139th IOC congress in Beijing stepped up to attack Gianni Infantino’s controversial idea before the IOC president Thomas Bach intervened to say that the Fifa president – who was due in Beijing – had not shown up and that further criticism should wait.  Those critical of Fifa’s plan included the National Olympic Committees of Africa President Mustapha Berraf, who claimed it would have a “heavy impact” on the continent and football in general. “The plan would create immeasurable damage and would put sport in danger and in particular football,” said Berraf. “It would simply push away other sports and relegate them to the back benches which is unacceptable and create a rift between women’s and men’s sport and be a setback to our aim of creating equity and parity for all sports.” He also pointed out that footballers were “not robots”, adding “I make the request to put an end to this endeavour which is incompatible with our Olympic values,” he added. Berraf’s intervention was particularly notable given that Infantino, who is an IOC member himself, last week claimed that his biennial World Cup proposal could help prevent African migrants from finding “death in the sea”. Nenad Lalovic, head of the United World Wrestling, and Ryu Seung-min, a former table tennis gold medallist and a member of the IOC Athletes’ Commission, also condemned the idea. “Football should cooperate in solidarity with other sports and International Federations,” added Ryu, “Sport is for all and we need more solidarity among sport.” However, Bach then stepped in to reveal that Infantino had cancelled his visit to Beijing two days ago – and that any discussions should take place with Infantino present. “We would like to discuss this with the Fifa president but this is not possible because he cancelled his visit to Beijing the day before yesterday,” said Bach. “We should not discuss this now on a wider scale on this issue in his absence in respect for our colleague. “If you agree, we will try to take contact with him again and forward these comments which have been made by Mr Berraf, Mr Lalovic and Mr Ryu to him and Fifa.”",Sport/Football,"Biennial World Cup will do ‘immeasurable damage’ to global sport, warn IOC members",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/biennial-world-cup-will-cause-immeasurable-damage-to-global-sport-warn-ioc-members
2/3/2022,"A Morrison government report to the United Nations on the status of the Great Barrier Reef claims its approach to tackling climate change is among the best in the world and its management of the reef was “second to none”. But conservationists and scientists immediately hit back at the claim, saying the reef needed more protection and the government’s record in cutting emissions and cutting pollution over it was inadequate.  Last week the Morrison government announced a $1bn reef funding package over the next nine years, including $580m for projects aimed at lowering pollution running into the reef. The report, delivered to the UN’s world heritage centre in Paris on Wednesday, was requested last year by the 21-country world heritage committee after it ignored Unesco’s recommendation to put the reef on an “in danger” list. The report comes as the reef is on the verge of a potential sixth mass bleaching event with scientists and conservationists hoping for enough cloud and rain in the next two weeks to cool the ocean off the north Queensland coast. Data from the Bureau of Meteorology has confirmed December was the hottest month on a record going back to 1900 for sea surface temperatures over the reef. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the government’s investments were “strengthening the resilience of the reef” and its management and scientific research was “second to none.” Unesco is due to carry out a monitoring mission to the reef in the first half of this year ahead of the world heritage committee meeting scheduled for July in Russia. Ley said on Thursday the mission would provide the committee with a “first-hand insight” into the scientific research and management of the reef. Unesco’s recommendation the reef be placed on the “in danger” list was prompted by the affects of three mass bleaching events on the reef in 2016, 2017 and 2020. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Morrison government staged a fierce lobbying effort to prevent the listing, with Ley flying to Europe on a government jet while Canberra-based ambassadors travelled to Queensland for a snorkelling trip on the reef. The government argues climate change impacts should not be used as justification for world heritage sites being placed on the list. The world heritage committee requested the report and raised concerns that progress on improving pollution levels and water quality across the reef was too slow. New plans needed to address “the threat posed to the property by climate change”, the committee said. In its UN submission, the government said an update to water quality monitoring – which has not yet been made public – “will show that some of the targets in the reef have already been met or exceeded”. The most recent report on reef water quality, using data up to 2019, suggested the federal and state governments were well behind meeting many of the 2025 targets and the adoption of voluntary programs among farmers to improve land management practices was low. Ley said global action on climate change was needed, but work to support scientists, farmers, traditional owners and tourism was vital “to ensure the long-term health of our iconic Great Barrier Reef”.

The Greenpeace Australia Pacific climate campaigner, Martin Zavan, said the government’s submission “reeks of hypocrisy” because it had refused to update its 2030 climate targets before last year’s Glasgow summit. Richard Leck, the head of oceans at WWF Australia, said the government’s $1bn pledge was welcome, but it was a “continuation of existing funding” rather than a significant increase. He said in 2021 Unesco had asked the government to deliver an emissions reduction plan that was consistent with keeping global heating to 1.5C. Analysts have said the government’s current 2030 emissions reduction targets are more aligned with global heating of 3C by the end of the century, rather than 1.5C. Lissa Schindler, Great Barrier Reef campaigner at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said until the Morrison government developed a credible climate change plan, it could not claim to have a “proper plan for the reef”. Jon Day, a former federal government official on world heritage, now a researcher at James Cook University, said the report would be used to lobby members of the committee in the lead up to the next meeting in July. “They will be taking these highlights to everyone on the committee and using it to make it sound as if they really, really care. I think they do care, but the reality is they don’t care enough.”",News/Environment,Scientists dispute Morrison government claim to UN its Great Barrier Reef approach ‘second to none’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/03/scientists-dispute-morrison-government-claim-to-un-its-great-barrier-reef-approach-second-to-none
2/3/2022,"In a mountain town near the north coast of Colombia, three drag queens strike poses in the blazing sun. Wearing extravagant Caribbean carnival costumes, they place each high heeled step carefully to avoid puddles. Neighbours come out to take photos and cheer. This impromptu show has unique significance in the streets of El Carmen de Bolívar, representing the remarkable resurgence of a community once brutally victimised by homophobic armed groups.  For nearly 30 years, the town and surrounding region of Montes de María were infamous for violence perpetrated against LGBTQ+ individuals, targeted at one time or another over the country’s long civil war by rightwing paramilitaries, leftwing guerrillas, government soldiers and the police. In the 1990s, paramilitaries formed in response to leftist activism and insurgency throughout Colombia. They took over El Carmen de Bolívar – a geographically strategic town of approximately 70,000 people with a history of leftwing activism and violently repressed those they viewed as proxy guerrilla supporters. “People could not say that they were from El Carmen de Bolívar because that meant they were guerrillas,” says Veronica, 35. Many of the armed groups in the region – publicly aligned with the country’s conservative elite – began persecuting the LGBTQ+ community. While such brutality was widespread in Colombia, in El Carmen de Bolívar and the surrounding region of Montes de María, it was made particularly public – including with forced boxing matches between gay men and transgender women. Sexual violence was rampant and meted out as a punishment. Those who resisted risked being taken in a van known as the “final tear”, as the people it picked up never returned. Yirley Velazco – a survivor of a paramilitary massacre and social leader in the neighbouring town of El Salado – remembers a helicopter dropping pamphlets in 1999 with a warning to LGBTQ+ people: get out now. “They named people who were part of the LGBTI community,” she says. “They said they were going to kill them for being gay, that they were going to kill them for not being part of mainstream society.” In El Carmen de Bolívar, La Pola, a 42-year-old trans woman, received similar leaflets, telling her to leave the area or be killed. Paramilitaries took over her house and used it as a base. Today, after leaving twice for nearby Cartagena to protect herself from violence, La Pola has returned to El Carmen de Bolívar, where she works as a hairdresser. She is grateful to be able to speakabout what happened to El Carmen de Bolívar’s LGBTQ+ community, and hopes it will be widely heard. “We have to be visible,” she says. Despite ongoing insecurity from drug trafficking groups like the Clan del Golfo, LGBTQ+ people in El Carmen de Bolívar say they feel more secure now than ever before. Corey, a gay 46-year-old, says he has experienced a huge change over the years. “I feel very happy because we can go out without any problems. Before we were afraid to go out, and if armed groups found us on the street at midnight, they could take us away, torture us, or send us home.” He says he has LGBTQ+ friends who “fled from El Carmen de Bolívar out of fear”. “We’re conscious that armed groups are returning to the territory, but at this moment, there haven’t been any threats directly against the LGBT community,” says Tito, 30. This new perceived security and acceptance is in part the result of a campaign by Caribe Afirmativo, an organisation which runs a community centre in the town. Services include a soup kitchen and job training, as well as outreach work to support understanding of the LGBTQ+ population. Dr Wilson Castañeda Castro, director of Caribe Afirmativo, says that alongside advocacy, training, and research, the group provides safe spaces for LGBTQ+ people in “periphery territories”, areas with limited government attention. Nawar, 26, a trans woman, is grateful to Caribe Afirmativo, saying the organisation taught her “to defend the human rights of the LGBT population”. “One of the things that makes me happy in El Carmen de Bolívar is that my advocacy work has been heard, that we have made progress, and that we have changed society,” she says. Castañeda warns that this sense of security in El Carmen de Bolívar is fragile – given the increasing violence in Colombia’s war-ravaged regions. He cautions that the increased visibility of LGBTQ+ people in national politics can reinforce discrimination, as the flames of homophobia are fanned for political gain. People in El Carmen de Bolívar still often face employment discrimination because of their sexual or gender identity, but say that they appreciate the current security as a time to flourish. After years of abuse and threats, Tito, 30, runs a folk dance group with many LGBTQ+ participants that has performed across Colombia. “It gives me a lot of joy to see how we have been able to achieve so much in a place that people thought was impossible,” he says. In one of the most dramatic departures from the past, the LGBTQ+ community is actively engaged with the town’s police and has developed a training and awareness programme for officers. In 2020 the Colombian national government formally recognised the collective damage suffered by the LGBTQ+ community of El Carmen de Bolívar because of the conflict, the third community in the country to receive this recognition. The ruling means support for the region’s efforts to document the community’s history. “This recognition is a possibility to promote a transformative reparation, for individuals and the collective,” says Castaneda, “that can heal old wounds and propose a new alternative, concrete reality to protect human rights in their daily lives.”  Some names have been changed  Support for anyone affected by sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

2/3/2022,"February is supposed to be the pinnacle of football excellence. Next Sunday, the Cincinnati Bengals will return to the Super Bowl after 33 years behind second-year phenomenon Joe Burrow to play the LA Rams and Matthew Stafford, who has never been to the big game in his 13 years in the league. Keeping with the theme of football excellence, fans, players and the media will no doubt express gratitude to Tom Brady, who this week announced his retirement after 22 years in the NFL and had arguably the greatest career the game has ever seen. Still, the magic of the moment is lost to myself and my Black colleagues. We watch our white counterparts rightly win praise for the success that they have earned. We Black coaches and players, on the other hand, have to fight twice as hard to get half as far. We saw it with Colin Kaepernick taking a knee to bring awareness to social injustice against Black and brown people, and subsequently being blackballed from the league despite leading his team to the Super Bowl just a few years prior. Colin hoped to highlight the fact that that though we are all created equal, we are not all treated equally, and that needs to change.  Now Brian Flores has taken up the same fight on the coaching side. Flores is suing the NFL over racial discrimination in an environment that he likens to “a plantation”, with rich white team owners profiting from the labor of young Black men. Flores’ lawsuit clearly struck a note and another Black coach, Hue Jackson, has come forward with his own allegations of discrimination (as well as claiming he was offered bonuses if his team lost). In a league focused on statistics like yards, touchdowns, sacks, and interceptions it’s easy to find numbers that back up Flores and Jackson’s claims of systemic racism. The NFL’s Rooney Rule states that teams must interview at least one minority candidate for head coaching vacancies. But, as Flores details in his lawsuit, these interviews are often undertaken with little chance of the minority candidate getting the job. The proof? When the Rooney Rule was instituted 20 years ago there were three Black head coaches in the NFL. Now there is one. More than a quarter of NFL teams have never even had a Black head coach. That includes one of the franchises named in Flores’ lawsuit, the New York Giants, who have existed for nearly 100 years in one of the most diverse cities on earth. It’s incredible that such a rule – whether it is effective or not – is needed in a league where more than two-thirds of players are Black. The imbalance leads players like me to the conclusion that, as Black people, we are valued by the league when we put our bodies and health on the line as players. But as soon as we offer our minds and leadership as coaches we are cast aside. We, as Black people, can be all things: players, coach, and owner; though an NFL team has never had all three at the same time. Having a leader with the same background and experiences as yourself is helpful. At the same time Black players are happy to play for white coaches if they are good leaders – no one could deny the skills of Bill Belichick, Andy Reid or Sean McVay. But we want to see that the NFL gives everyone the same chance of becoming a leader. The most significant currency in any sport, as with society as a whole, is opportunity. And as Black History Month starts, it appears that in the NFL if you’re a Black coach, you’re soon history. Earlier this season, we got a peek into the bigoted conversations that happen off the field when leaked emails showed former Raiders head coach Jon Gruden and other NFL figures using racist, homophobic and misogynistic language. And take it from someone who played in the league: we can be sure that those emails were a small glimpse into the mindset of many in football. When the next generation – my nephews or my future children – come to me and ask to play football, what will my reaction be? Will I be confident that whatever they put into the sport will be paid back? Or will I recoil and prepare them for the discriminatory and challenging road that a love of sports may subject them to? I find strength in the Black players, coaches, and people fighting to make the league a more inclusive place for all. Still, as with any movement, there needs to be allyship. Why are marginalized voices often asked to change systems of oppression that we did not create? Looking back on my time in the NFL, I wish I had done more to fight for justice off the field, as I fought for my teammates on the field. But I have hope. I choose to believe that as brave men like Flores come forward that the NFL, which I love so much, will continue to grow. This is not the same league that it was at its founding when Black players were banned from competing in the 1930s and 1940s. And regardless of this particular dispute, it will not be the same league moving forward. If you show up to play or coach and are qualified, respectful, hardworking, and team-oriented, you should be rewarded. I think we can all agree that we want to get what we have earned. I hope that as we lend our voices through essays, interviews, protests, platforms and donations, we can all agree on one thing: we as humans were all created equally and thus should be treated equally. If you’re a leader, you should have the chance to lead. RK Russell played in the NFL for the Dallas Cowboys and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
