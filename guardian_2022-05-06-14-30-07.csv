5/6/2022,"The gotcha question has returned to the already damaged election campaign news coverage and reporters, and consumers of their reports, will suffer. It’s a branch of what I call rudeness journalism, a close cousin to the style of some radio shock jocks and after-dark TV presenters who cultivate a confusion between shouty-ness and authority. The flimsy basis for this style is: the bigger the bellow, the greater the truth. The immediate aim of the press conference gotcha often is to establish the superiority of the questioners over the candidate. It enables the practitioner to implicitly strive to identify who is in charge, and it’s not the candidate. A disturbing element of Labor leader Anthony Albanese this week being caught unable to outline his own NDIS policy was the unnecessary and unseemly discourtesy of the questioner from the Nine television news network. The reporter clearly wanted to be the star of that press conference, not the alternative prime minister. The gratuitous countdown on a pointed finger was a crass exercise in self promotion which revealed the central intention was to create a “look at me” moment. Further, his loud talking over the Albanese response and tone raised sympathy for the gotcha victim among those who decided he had not been given a chance to properly respond. None of this exculpates the gotcha victim entirely. Albanese should have known the unemployment rate, he should have been able to briskly list all six points of his NDIS policy. His shortcomings on those two matters allowed Liberal leader Scott Morrison to intensify personal attacks on the competence of his rival, and was seen to substantiate internal ALP grumblings that Albanese doesn’t do his homework. “Get across the detail, Labor MPs tell Albanese,” read the front page headline of Friday’s the Australian. “Albanese forgets Labor’s six point NDIS plan,” said the Financial Review. And on the Nine network news the questioner was given the space usually reserved for heroes as he promoted himself and his gotcha triumph. The lack of detail could have been exposed without rudeness journalism. Morrison wasn’t a gotcha target when he mixed up the daily jobseeker daily benefit payment with the weekly rate. That was merely a self-engineered display of incompetence. Questioning backed by substance rather than by random baiting, by informed directness rather than by opportunism, is more effective in revealing the weaknesses of the candidates. Few statements have condemned Morrison more than those he has volunteered, such as his painfully thin fear of a “public autocracy” were a federal anti-corruption body to examine pork barrel projects. There is an argument that the paltry content of both the Liberal and Labor campaigns — one a caravan distributing Albo empathy, the other a series of ScoMo pretend jobs — has left space for reporters to come up with their own dynamics. Thus the gotcha and rudeness journalism which were so potent against then Labor leader Bill Shorten in the 2019 campaign. The danger is that these tactics don’t leave much space for genuine policy discussions and parlaying of information needed by voters. Any entertainment factor limits the lifespan of information. If the vacuity continues for the final two weeks of the campaign, the press conference aggression will intensify and might follow the applause given the gotcha gang of reporters. The anti-gotcha hero of this campaign was the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, who on 13 April curtly dismissed an attempt during an appearance at the National Press Club when he was asked whether he knew the current WPI (wage price index). “Google it mate,” he told a questioner from the Australian Financial Review. Bandt continued: “Politics should be about reaching for the stars and offering a better society. “And instead … there’s these questions that are asked about, ‘Can you tell us about this particular stat?’” Unfortunately, there has not been much reaching for the stars in campaign coverage so far.

5/6/2022,"The Met Office’s atmospheric survey aircraft (Moasa) flew for the last time on 11 April, after funding ended. Packed with scientific instruments, Moasa has been on standby to examine the fringes of volcanic ash clouds to see if it is safe for commercial jets. It also flew over London, Birmingham and Manchester to see pollution changes during lockdown and recently worked with university researchers as they made measurements on the ground. It was designed to carry three people, and on first impression flying in Moasa felt like a fairground ride. The pilot Tim Lewton seemed worryingly busy with controls as we climbed away from Bournemouth airport, the propellers thundering a few metres from my head. The Met Office scientist Joss Kent sat behind me watching readouts from instruments hung below the wings and packed into the cabin and nose. A laser probed the air above us too. Kent read out results from our first source of the day, the nitrogen dioxide from the aircraft around us. Others followed. Aircraft measurements began in 1918 and have been important to predict how pollutants build up in the air over our cities and how polluted air moves from place to place. In the 1970s they were pivotal to connecting the UK’s coal-fired power stations to acid rain and forest dieback in Scandinavia. Moasa was designed after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption that closed most of Europe’s airspace. Over the countryside we saw dust from construction sites and quarries, and measured soot from bonfires on farms. As we passed low over Canary Wharf and the Millennium Dome in London, Moasa’s instruments detected the nitrogen dioxide and particle pollution drifting upward from the city’s traffic. Over the Channel smoke trails hung behind the ships below. Marine fuel used in the Channel contains 100 times more sulphur than the petrol and diesel in a car, as well as many heavy metals. From the Channel we also saw a brown layer of air pollution from agriculture and industry settled over France. This would spread over London later that day. Our home leg took us at low level, 150 metres (500ft) above the sea. Previous flights have measured pollution from the cruise ships moored in Southampton Water, but I suggested diverting over the domed-shaped Marchwood waste incinerator. As we turned, we measured one of the biggest pollution spikes of the day; but it was also one of our closest sources at just a couple of hundred metres beneath. A quick check of the instruments showed the incinerator’s particle filters were working. The data we collected will be used to drive warning systems to tell vulnerable people when air pollution is going to become especially severe and to verify that pollution sources are being controlled correctly. Sadly, with funding at an end, it looks like Moasa will be sold and converted back into a small passenger plane.",News/Environment,Pollutionwatch: the sad end of the Met Office’s atmospheric survey plane,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/06/pollutionwatch-final-flight-met-office-aerial-survey-plane
5/6/2022,"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but there is a new app to know about. BeReal, touted as the “anti-Instagram”, is currently the No 1 free app on the App Store in the US. It promises, slightly unnervingly, “a new and unique way to discover who your friends really are in their daily life”. It works by sending an amber-alert-style push notification to all its users at once – one that includes two panic-inducing yellow warning sign emojis and a message that it is “time to BeReal”. Upon receiving this missive, everyone uploads a photo of what they are doing at that exact moment in time, regardless of whether they happen to be dancing in a club with their friends or sitting alone on their sofa and staring at the wall. It also takes a simultaneous snapshot from both your front and back-facing cameras, which explains why this app is mostly being used by teenagers and not those of us who have matured into multiple chins. Crucially, you can’t see anyone else’s BeReal until you have posted your own. The app has grown faster than its French founders, Alexis Barreyat – who previously worked at GoPro - and Kévin Perreau anticipated when they created it in 2020, with many users complaining that the single photo permitted each day is taking for ever to upload. After setting up my profile on the app, I am shown possible friends of mine who are already there, being more real than me. They include two friends from university who don’t use Instagram, a cool girl whose couch I stayed on in New York in 2014, the cool girl who’s couch I’m currently staying on in Los Angeles, my editor, and a boy with whom I had a disastrous romantic affair in Denmark many years ago. I add them all, bar the obvious exception. The app also lets you see strangers’ posts in the Discovery tab, and most users appear to be teenagers. BeReal’s key ethos is authenticity. Its lack of filters and sense of urgency are designed to eliminate any notions of curation or artifice, words that have seemingly become tarnished by Instagram and its glossy influencers. You can’t even see what the front camera is capturing to help you at least pick a flattering angle. My first BeReal was a slightly meta snap of me watching the TV, reflected in the mirror. My friend Tom, who is in Turin doing a doctorate, posted a photo of himself and his partner preparing asparagus for dinner. My editor posted a photo of a fish in a tank, and his best impersonation of said fish. Having reached the end of my “feed’’ with these three posts, I clicked back to the “discovery” tab – which is a slew of strangers in mundanity: someone cooking ramen; someone sitting at a train station in London; a blonde woman on a sofa in Illinois watching baseball and drinking wine with a pile of just-wrapped presents on the floor; a young man in Brazil stuck in traffic; five teenage girls hanging out in a green stairwell; a lot of kids doing homework in their bedrooms. It succeeds at its goal of being drab, but why would anyone want an app to un–inspire them? Annoyingly, for the week-long duration of this experiment, my BeReal notification went off at some time between 4am and 7am. The app moaned that I was “posting late” although it still allowed me to post, somewhat defeating BeReal’s stated purpose. One time I offered it a photo of my morning coffee but pointed the front camera towards to the ceiling fan, because I did not want to post a picture of myself from below the chin first thing in the morning. The app patronizingly told me “your friends prefer it when they can see your face!”, which I would have to disagree with. Personally, I didn’t feel these prosaic images represented my daily life at all. In my mind, my life is all palm trees silhouetted against beautiful sunsets and hummingbirds drinking from blossoms and the feeling of the sun on my skin – which are the things I post on Instagram. Life can be both authentic and beautiful at the same time, and pretending that “real” life is always ugly and trivial seems like a miserablist’s way to understand the world. My Instagram output may be curated rather than created under hostage-like circumstances, but ultimately it feels more authentic to me than a photo of my forehead and a half-eaten salad.",News/Media,"I tried BeReal, the ‘authentic Instagram’ app – would it show the real me?",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/05/i-tried-bereal-the-authentic-instagram-app-would-it-show-the-real-me
5/6/2022,"Rose Ayling-Ellis, the actor and Strictly Come Dancing champion, is to become the first celebrity to use British Sign Language to read a CBeebies bedtime story. The 27-year-old, who has been deaf since birth, starred as Frankie Lewis in BBC soap EastEnders and went on to win Strictly last year. On Sunday, she will make her debut in the CBeebies story corner, telling the tale in BSL of a young bear and his father on their journey into the discovery and management of deafness. To celebrate Deaf Awareness Week, she will sign Can Bears Ski?, written by Raymond Antrobus and illustrated by Polly Dunbar. The story draws on the author’s own experience to show how isolating it can be for a deaf child in a hearing world. “I am super excited to read my first CBeebies bedtime story in BSL and it’s even more wonderful to share a story written by a deaf writer,” she said. “I hope deaf children enjoy the story and it inspires hearing children to want to learn BSL more.” While competing in the 19th series of Strictly, Ayling-Ellis performed a routine with dance partner Giovanni Pernice during which they paused the music and danced in silence as a tribute to the deaf community. The moment has been nominated for the must-see moment Bafta, a category voted for by the public. Since then, BSL is also set to be given legal recognition. “The reaction was incredible, because it made them think what they can do to be better towards deaf people,” Ayling-Ellis told the BBC on Thursday. “Now it’s becoming an official language, which means we have more rights to it … For example, when you have a doctor’s appointment, you should have a right to have an interpreter there. Before, you couldn’t, because it’s not an official language. So it will be a huge step forward.” Can Bears Ski? will be the first ever BSL-signed story on CBeebies. Ayling-Ellis will speak only to introduce the story and at the end of the programme to say goodnight to the audience. The story will also have subtitles and will be the first of two stories she has recorded for CBeebies. The soap star has actively campaigned for BSL to be recognised as an official language and be given legal status in the UK. CBeebies Bedtime Stories airs daily at 6.50pm, with episodes signed by a BSL interpreter shown every Saturday and Sunday. In 2018, comedian Rob Delaney read a CBeebies bedtime story in Makaton – a programme that uses hand signs alongside spoken language to communicate – with which he learned to converse with his toddler son who died shortly before the story aired.",Arts/Television & radio,Rose Ayling-Ellis to read CBeebies bedtime story in British Sign Language,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/06/rose-ayling-ellis-cbeebies-bedtime-story-british-sign-language
5/6/2022,"Two businessmen who together donated more than £1m pounds to the Conservative party have been handed prominent public health jobs, igniting a new “cronyism” row. After the government came under criticism for its awarding of Covid contracts, including a “VIP lane” for suppliers, Labour raised fresh questions about recent appointments to NHS England and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). One of those given a senior public health advisory role was chair of a firm that reportedly sued the NHS for hundreds of millions of pounds over a failed IT project. There is no suggestion that improper recruitment processes were followed. But the health secretary, Sajid Javid, was urged to ensure there would be no conflicts of interest. In March, Oluwole Kolade was made a non-executive director and deputy chair of NHS England for three years. In just over a decade, Kolade has donated £859,342 to Conservative party headquarters; the party’s London mayoral candidate in 2021, Shaun Bailey; and the party’s branch in Hitchin and Harpenden. About a third of the donations – £300,000 – have been made since Boris Johnson became prime minister. The government’s public appointments website said the appointing department was Javid’s and added: “Kolade has made a donation to the Conservative party.” Kolade is a managing partner of Livingbridge, a private equity firm with extensive investments in private healthcare. On its website the company said it “has made a private equity investment in the healthcare and education sector in almost every single year for the past two decades”. Livingbridge’s portfolio includes multiple NHS suppliers, and private dental companies, care providers and fertility firms. Andrew Gwynne, the shadow health minister, said the appointment looked like “naked Conservative cronyism” and urged against the NHS being “placed in the hands of the highest bidder”. He called on Javid to “come clean about what guarantees he secured that this position won’t be used to benefit private interests over public health”. Another prolific donor, Simon Blagden, was made a member of the UKHSA advisory board in April. Since 2005, Blagden and companies he is associated with have donated £376,000 to the Conservatives. These include Pietas Ltd, a firm he was director of from 2000 to 2020, and Avre Partnership Limited, which he has been director of since 2014. He was also a chairman of Fujitsu UK, which sued the NHS over a failed IT project. A parliamentary committee’s inquiry into the debacle in 2013 cited reports that a sum of £700m was sought from the Department of Health. Blagden already holds a role in government – as chair of its telecoms supply chain diversification advisory council at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport – and in 2016 was awarded a CBE for services to the economy. Labour said that “yet again, the Tories have appointed one of their own to a crucial public role”. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “Political activity is not a bar to holding a public appointment. In line with the requirements of the code of governance for public appointments, if someone has been politically active and has made donations, the government declares this when the appointment is announced. “Wol Kolade was appointed by ministers in 2018 as a non-executive director on the board of NHS Improvement – he declared he had made donations to the Conservative party and the department declared this when he was first appointed and again when he was reappointed this year.” A UKHSA spokesperson said: “All members of our advisory board have been appointed in line with government protocols and will provide vital impartial oversight and advice to help UKHSA deliver its strategic objectives.” Kolade and his company Livingbridge were contacted for comment. Blagden was contacted for comment through Larkspur International, where he is a director.",News/Politics,Two donors who gave Tories £1m between them handed public health jobs,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/labour-question-tories-cronyism-row-donors-public-health-jobs-nhs
5/6/2022,"In June of last year, assistant district attorney Bidish Sarma sat before a pile of paperwork, more than 1,500 disorganized pages tall, rummaging for answers. It was a second-degree murder case file dating back to 1993, which had been in the possession of the New Orleans district attorney’s office for almost three decades. Its secrets had gone untold until now. As he parsed the pages – old trial transcripts, police reports, witness interviews – he came across a series of handwritten notes that sent a wave of energy through his body and pushed his pulse rate skywards. The name Kuantay Reeder had not been mentioned in public discourse since July 1995. Then, buried in the back of the Times-Picayune, a short article recorded that the 21-year-old had been found guilty of murdering a man named Mark Broxton outside a corner store. The last sentence noted that the prosecution had largely relied on the testimony of a single eyewitness. Reeder had been held at the Louisiana state penitentiary, known as Angola prison, ever since. He had been sentenced to life “at hard labor”, forced to work while incarcerated, without the possibility of parole. He had, he said, maintained his innocence from the day he was arrested. He was now 49 years old. He kept three treasured possessions inside: a handwritten letter he received from his daughter at the beginning of his sentence, a skull cap worn by his baby grandson and a faded Polaroid photograph of his mother Shirley, a postal worker who raised him alone. He kept them under his pillow, and held them at night “in time of darkness, when I think about dying in prison”, he said. Realistically, there was little legal hope left. But as Sarma read through the handwritten interview notes, he began to realize that Reeder’s conviction may have been based on severely flawed evidence, suppressed from public knowledge for almost 30 years. He called his boss, the chief of the Orleans parish civil rights division, Emily Maw. “Holy shit, look what I found,” he told her. “How is it possible that this has been sat on for so long?” That both Sarma and Maw, former non-profit defense attorneys, even had access to these documents was a small political miracle in itself – one that started with the 2020 election of New Orleans’s new district attorney, a progressive firebrand named Jason Williams. Few insiders gave Williams much of a chance. He had already lost in a landslide for the same job back in 2008, and only had two endorsements from elected officials this time around. He also ran for election under a federal indictment for alleged tax fraud (that he maintains is politically motivated), which many viewed as the end of his political career. It was momentum that thrust him to a comfortable victory. A swell of protests had swept the country after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, enabling a well-organized grassroots campaign to defy convention. Williams became one of a number of recently elected progressive DAs in major American cities – including San Francisco, Philadelphia and Los Angeles – swept to office amid a national reckoning on racial justice and increased public understanding over the powerful role local DAs play in shaping the US criminal justice system. The result shook the political establishment of New Orleans and made Williams something of an exception among prosecutors in the US south: an outspoken Black reformer operating in the center of America’s mass incarceration crisis. “When a legal system condemns, incarcerates and executes people because it prioritizes convictions over justice,” Williams said in a speech as he was sworn into office, “then why would members of the public believe that doing the right thing will ever keep them safe?” In 2012, one out of every 14 Black men from New Orleans was incarcerated. While the number has fallen substantially since then, Louisiana remains America’s most incarcerated state, with the New Orleans metro area sending more people to prison than any other location. The root causes lay in this state’s racist past, but extend also to the practices of Williams’s predecessors who have for decades responded to soaring crime rates with a perceived culture of win-at-all-costs prosecutions – seeking the toughest punishments possible, sometimes bending and breaking the rules to secure convictions in a system that often targets speed over due process. At the core of Williams’s election was a pledge to change this. Among his first acts as DA was the creation of a new civil rights division run by Maw, a Brit and the former head of New Orleans’s Innocence Project. Its purpose: to unabashedly confront the ills of the past. Although operating in a politically antagonistic climate exacerbated further by a new crime surge, the division has intervened in more than 150 old cases, leading to immediate release from prison in 128 instances since its creation. It has done so through a range of detailed investigations leading to resentencings, new plea deals and exonerations, making it perhaps the most active conviction review program anywhere in the US. For the past six months the Guardian has been given extensive access to the division, nestled in a corner on the fourth floor of the DA’s office, a brutalist building where ugly, yellow light fills rows of symmetrical office cubicles, for a series of print and audio reports documenting their work and cases they have re-examined. Some, like Reeder’s, have received no media coverage until now. Mark Broxton was killed on a warm spring evening in the neighborhood of Algiers on 13 April 1993. A gunman shot four times as Broxton used a payphone outside a grocery shop called Julian’s Food Store. It was about 6.50pm. These facts have never been contested. But it took the district attorney’s office two trials to convict Kuantay Reeder, an indication that the case was far from clearcut. The killing was one of 395 murders in New Orleans that year, the second highest annual total in the city’s recorded history. The state’s central witness was a 46-year-old man named Earl Price, who said he had watched the shooting from across the street. Price told the court in both trials the gunman had been facing him but was standing dozens of feet away across traffic when he opened fire. Price then walked into the food store, according to trial transcripts, and saw the gunman fleeing, later dumping a jacket into a dumpster as he ran away. Critically, the court was told by police and Price himself, that he had, without hesitation, picked out and signed Reeder’s photograph from a lineup presented to him by police a full three months after the shooting. A second eyewitness named Norma Varist, who initially implicated Reeder, refused to testify in court and was jailed for contempt, in front of the jury, because of her refusal at the second trial. But hearsay evidence related to her identification was admitted without contest. Price recounted an elaborate story about watching the 21-year-old father of three die. Broxton, he said, had walked into Julian’s after being shot four times, picked up a can of Coke and walked towards the counter to pay, but then collapsed into Price’s arms. A forensic pathologist who also testified described this version of events as highly unlikely given the extent of Broxton’s fatal gunshot wounds. The store’s cashier (who could not be located for the second trial after the DA’s office failed to disclose he was being prosecuted in a separate case) also disputed the account and said the doors had been locked after Broxton entered his store, meaning it was unlikely Price could have followed him in. But Price stuck with his story. “I’m not going to change my testimony, regardless of how much you road hog me here,” Price said, according to court transcripts, as the defense poked holes in his account at the second trial. “I’m gonna be in here with the same thing I seen. And I’m going to say it over and over again, until I’m dead.” Reeder recalled watching Price testify that day. “It was like he was tearing me apart,” he said, as tears welled in the corners of his eyes. “I had been trying to stand up and keep myself together, but it felt like he was taking a piece of me, and throwing it in the corner. Another piece, throwing it this way. Another that way. By the end I was bare bones. I was no longer me. I was no longer a whole person.” Three defense witnesses testified that Reeder had been playing basketball at a nearby housing project when the shooting occurred, and had eaten a meal with his mother after. But the prosecution was unflinching in its assessment, citing Price’s testimony as key evidence. “Kuantau [Kuantay] Reeder is an intentional murderer,” said the lead prosecutor, Michael Daniels, in closing, according to a transcript. (For the past 30 years, Reeder’s name has incorrectly been spelled “Kuantau Reeder” in all legal documents.) The jury deliberated for less than two hours. Reeder recalled feeling little for himself as the verdict was read. “I was already dehumanized,” he said. “The pain I was feeling was for my mother who sat behind me. My daughter. My wife.” He remained unaware for three decades that he had been convicted by an 11-1 non-unanimous jury. Louisiana has allowed such decisions because of a Jim Crow-era law designed to dampen the power of Black jurors; non-unanimous decisions have disproportionately disadvantaged Black defendants ever since. In 2020 the US supreme court ruled the law unconstitutional. Reeder was taken to Angola prison, the sprawling maximum-security facility built on the grounds of a former plantation. And for his first 11 years inside, he was made to work out on the fields, tilling soil on the same land once toiled by enslaved people. “No man, no animal, should ever have to work like that,” he said. Jason Williams’s first day as district attorney started with an office littered with mess. Poorly labeled boxes were piled in his personal office and strewn across the grand jury room. Inside were case files, some left in wax-sealed seafood boxes to protect them from regular roof leaks. “That lack of order and lack of systems really speaks to how this place has operated for a very long time,” Williams said one recent afternoon as he gazed out of his window on to the city’s old jail building, a decaying concrete mass that towers over the horizon. “It speaks to how the wrong person gets arrested and gets prosecuted and convicted.” Over the past few decades New Orleans has become infamous for so-called “Brady violations” – named after the landmark 1963 supreme court decision Brady v Maryland, which established that prosecutors were constitutionally required to turn over all favorable evidence that might exonerate a defendant before trial. The city has been scarred by a series of high-profile Brady cases, many under the tenure of New Orleans’s longest serving DA, Harry Connick Sr, who was elected in 1973 and, winning five successive elections, held office for 30 years. It was the exoneration of John Thompson, a Black man who spent 14 years on death row after being wrongfully convicted of murder and armed robbery, which brought the chronic issue to national attention. Just weeks before he was due to be executed, investigators uncovered a lab report showing the perpetrator’s blood type did not match Thompson’s. It was later revealed that one of the prosecutors involved had confessed on his deathbed to deliberately hiding the evidence from Thompson’s defense. Years after his release, when Thompson lost a $14m compensation claim in a now notorious 5-4 supreme court ruling, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in her dissent that the case “demonstrated that misperception and disregard of Brady’s disclosure requirements were pervasive in Orleans parish”. She noted that the DA’s office training manual at the time contained just four sentences on Brady. A later report by the Innocence Project found that during Connick’s tenure, evidence had been withheld in a quarter of all death penalty convictions, nine of 36 cases. Four of those led to exonerations. In a rare interview at his home, Connick, now 96, sat at his desk, smoking cigarettes as he spoke. “Do you know how many cases in 30 years that we prosecuted out there?” he said defiantly. “Thousands and thousands and thousands. Was there a mistake made in some? Yes. But that doesn’t represent what that office stands for.” He pointed to a hand-painted dove, a symbol of the Holy Spirit, that hung above his mantle. “It is a moral violation, a sin, to charge someone with something they didn’t commit or to charge someone when there wasn’t sufficient evidence,” he said. “That was the message I sent to my lawyers.” Asked his views on Ginsburg’s famous dissent, he replied, unflinchingly: “Ruth Bader Ginsburg is full of shit.” Kuantay Reeder had grown up in a tough neighborhood, the Fischer Projects in Algiers, and was no stranger to the harsh realities of life there. But the violence he witnessed in prison continued to shock him. From the time he said he was beaten by the police officers who initially questioned him back in 1993 to when he saw men crushed and cut in prison fights, and when he himself was involved in brawls during spates of torrid violence. After 11 years of grinding field work, Reeder said, he was granted “trustee” status, earning greater prison freedoms and finding solace working in the gardens and learning about tropical plants – pansies, copper plants, birds of paradise. His wife, Vanessa Scott, had returned to him after a few years apart. She came to visit once a month, a five-hour round trip from New Orleans. They would sit in the visitation room together for a few hours, holding hands. “To know that you have somebody love you that much that they’re willing to stay by your side through something like this … You can never shun that. Never wash that off. It’s on you for life,” he said. But even as his mind eased on occasion, he still thought about his case. How he believed his name had been bandied around the projects, and how police had initially essentially pursued hearsay and gossip as a means to investigate. Reeder had known Broxton as a child, he had always said, but had not seen him in years. And no motive had ever been clearly corroborated at trial. In addition, there had been another suspect police investigated, who was later named in court in connection with the crime, nicknamed “Bird”. The alternate suspect matched the physical description given by Price closer than Reeder. And he had, according to his ex-partner during a police interview, threatened Broxton from inside prison over a romantic dispute. He had later called her minutes after the shooting to say Broxton had been killed, according to testimony. She had earlier told police Bird had told her how many times he had been shot and where on his body the shots had landed. Reeder had made Brady claims throughout the post-conviction process, after his case was taken up by the veteran defense attorney Sheila Myers at the Tulane criminal justice clinic. She had been given access to a few hundred pages of documents under public records requests, and later uncovered that Earl Price, the sole testifying eyewitness, had a federal conviction for lying on a firearms application that had not been disclosed at trial. She argued in court that this further undermined his reliability as a witness and fought Reeder’s case doggedly for over a decade. But successive state and federal courts had denied the applications for retrial, finding that the conviction was not substantial given the rest of Price’s extensive criminal record had been known at the time. The applications were consistently opposed by the Orleans DA’s office. In a quarter of all cases the civil rights division has re-examined, the DA’s file is lost or missing, according to internal figures shared with the Guardian. In the vast majority of cases from before Hurricane Katrina, evidence held at the city’s courthouse has been destroyed either by flooding from the hurricane or by court order. Maw had always expected to be re-examining unresolved Brady claims as part of the new civil rights division’s work. But she was shocked to see such disarray among the records. “If someone is saying my conviction is unfair because I think the state didn’t turn over all the evidence, there is no way for us to go back and analyze whether that suspicion is true if we can’t see what was in the state’s file,” she said. “You can’t analyze whether there may be state misconduct if the records aren’t there.” As of March, the civil rights division had received 204 claims of wrongful conviction from currently incarcerated people. The vast majority, 179, came from those without current legal representation – adding further obstacles to re-examination. In order to pull files from the Connick era, the civil rights division has relied on the assistance of a small records office in a windowless, rectangular office space on the third floor of the DA’s building. Here, hundreds of small drawers contain tens of thousands of index cards. Each card a criminal case, documenting a record on microfilm. The drawers of microfilm, too, were damaged by humidity following Katrina, leaving many stinking of vinegar as they slowly decay. Until midway through last year, the division relied on a now defunct Konica Minolta MD 6000 microfilm machine (spare parts had to be ordered from eBay). Each page was scanned individually by volunteers. Eventually, following a donation, a modern machine was purchased. But the DA’s file on Reeder had been preserved. It was over 900 pages, not the few hundred received by his lawyers in previous requests. And Sarma now had it in his hands. In a trial report, written after the first hung jury, prosecutors appeared to acknowledge inconsistencies in the lone eyewitness testimony. “Each time [Earl] Price tells his story, it changes,” prosecutors noted in the report. In a memo before the first trial, in which prosecutors considered lowering the charges, they wrote of their “star witness”: “We do not believe we stand a chance of getting a conviction on Price’s testimony.” But in there, nestled away even further, were the handwritten notes discovered by Sarma that almost took his breath away. They revealed, in perfectly formed handwriting, that Price had on two separate occasions insisted that he had identified another number in the lineup during pre-trial interviews. The number corresponded to the alternate suspect, Bird. Police had placed photographs of the alternate suspect (No 5) and Reeder (No 6) next to each other in the six-person photo lineup presented to Price. The handwritten notes revealed it was Bird’s number Price twice insisted he had identified. In interview notes written on 19 October 1993, Price told investigators he had signed photograph No 5. (See note here.) In a follow-up interview with prosecutors on 27 December 1993, the notes are even more forceful, conveying Price was “adamant” he had signed off on photograph No 5. A small diagram of the lineup is included in the notes, which suggest Price said at least four times during the interview he did not sign the photograph with Reeder’s number. (See note here.) One line reads: “Price says he picked #5 that would be [Bird],” listing the suspect’s full name. (The photographic lineup presented at trial and shown to the jury, has been lost.) None of this information had been disclosed. Instead, it laid buried in a file for almost 30 years as Reeder fought to prove his conviction was unjust. Unreliable eyewitness identifications have contributed to 69% of wrongful convictions overturned by post-conviction DNA evidence, according to the Innocence Project. (There was no DNA evidence in the Broxton case.) The handwritten notes could have critically undermined the prosecution’s case. They were potentially a major claim under Brady. It took six months for the civil rights division to reinvestigate the case. The work kept Sarma, a softly spoken, mild-mannered man, awake at night. “I had a pretty clear idea of where things were going to go,” he recalled. “But every day it takes to get there feels like a weight on your shoulders. That you need to correct something that is clearly an injustice.” They discovered that Price had died in August 2020, leaving many questions unanswered. Why had he insisted, on two occasions, he identified another photograph? Why had he changed this account at trial? And why was this potentially vital inconsistency never disclosed to the defense? A fragment of an answer, Sarma thought, perhaps lay in the notes, indicating that Price’s signature may have made its way on to Reeder’s photograph due to administrative error by a distracted detective. The notes reveal Price had told prosecutors that “detective was typing while statement”, and then told them again he expected “his name will be under #5”. Sarma spoke to the old prosecutors, who largely defended their handling of the case. In an interview with the Guardian, Michael Daniels, the lead prosecutor, was dismissive of the civil rights division’s work. He said he could not recall specifics of his pre-trial interview with Price on 27 December 1993 but stated that because Price’s signature was ultimately found on the back of Reeder’s photograph, “the lineup spoke for itself”. He said he could not recall what he was specifically referring to in his first trial report, which stated: “Each time Price tells his story, it changes.” “His [Price’s] signature was behind Mr Reeder, and the jury could have seen it with their own eyes,” Daniels said, pointing out he checked the original lineup after his interview with Price. Asked whether this clear discrepancy in the state’s central witness’s recollection should have been disclosed to Reeder’s defense he said: “You know, 20 years later, I can’t tell you that I don’t see some validity to that argument … I’m not gonna say that that’s 100% black and white. It is grey in my mind.” He added it was not a decision he made on his own, and that other prosecutors at the time had agreed they did not need to disclose. The division spoke to Reeder’s original trial lawyer, now a city judge, who confirmed that if he had been aware of Price’s critical inconsistencies on photo ID, they would have played a “central role” in cross-examination. Sarma also confirmed that the alternate suspect had been released from prison the day before the shooting. In an interview with the Guardian, Bird, who has never been charged in relation to the crime, was presented with the allegations made against him during the police investigation and sworn to in court. He denied any involvement in the incident. “I had nothing to do with that, nothing at all,” he said, adding Broxton was a friend of his. The suspect was also interviewed by the civil rights division as part of their reinvestigation. Mary Green had attempted to forget about the case from the day of the guilty verdict. Broxton was her oldest son. A handsome, fresh-faced 21-year-old, denied the opportunity to fulfill his promise as a father because of a senseless crime. Although he had fallen on hard times before the shooting, she had always prayed he would find his way. He left behind two daughters and another yet to be born. Green worked as a city bus driver when her son was killed, and was driving a route nearby when the shots rang out. She believed that law enforcement had faithfully attempted to catch her son’s killer, but nearly three decades later she received a phone call from the DA’s office that changed everything. “I had never expected to go through it again because I didn’t want to relive something I had put behind me,” Green said, her voice faint. But as the new facts were divulged to her, she felt a creeping sense of devastation, that the justice system had failed her and her son as well. “I felt that if he [Reeder] was innocent of these charges then it was so unfair for him to have served the time that he did,” she said. A question lingered in her mind over the original prosecution. “Was it just easier for you to prosecute Mr Reeder?” she recalled. “Or was it just to satisfy me, knowing that I wanted to have someone to pay for the crime? Did they just do it for my sake?” Part of reckoning with past harms in the criminal legal system requires engaging with victims’ families. News of the investigation was hard to comprehend. But the Broxton family threw their support behind the work. On completion of the investigation, the division was certain: they would argue Reeder’s sentence should be vacated under Brady. But it would be left for a judge to decide. During its first year in operation, and despite the hundreds of cases on its docket, the Orleans parish civil rights division has operated with just two full-time attorneys and two investigators. But despite its small size, the work has made waves, often drawing outspoken criticism from the city’s old political establishment. In May last year, the division moved to vacate the conviction of a man named Kaliegh Smith in another case involving significant Brady claims. It was revealed that prosecutors under Williams’s predecessor, Leon Cannizzaro, had secretly paid the central eyewitness implicating Smith in a 2007 murder. In the Smith case, Cannizzaro issued a written statement accusing the new administration of being “deceitful to the public” without, according to local reports, specifically addressing the nature of the Brady violation. It would not be the last time the former DA publicly criticized the work of the division. “It’s a very bizarre paradigm,” said Maw. “We are still in a race, not against Cannizzaro himself, but what his office stood for. And it’s not voluntary, it’s because a very powerful political establishment still owns a lot of the discussion.” Throughout his investigation into the Reeder case, Sarma worried about how the public might perceive the work. “I have felt at times like people are going to question our credibility to be doing this kind of work. So I think there is a heightened burden on us to dot every I and cross every T. I don’t think that’s a bad thing, we have to be thorough,” he said. “What we want to accomplish is resolving cases that have been unfairly tried, but we also want to build trust in the community that we’re doing this appropriately.” Perhaps looming larger over Williams’s tenure, and the future of the civil rights division, is the DA’s federal tax fraud indictment. Williams, who has pleaded not guilty, has long argued the 11-count indictment accusing him of inflating business expenses and avoiding $200,000 in tax over five years was politically motivated. He points to alleged threats his office received from a Cannizzaro operative after reports he would run for DA. “The idea that talking about race the way I talked about it, talking about being smart on crime and criminal justice reform the way I talked about it, long before the campaign even started, put a target on my back,” Williams said. “But I think it also helped me win this seat, because people saw the results of speaking out.” Cannizzaro has forcefully denied any involvement. A trial date is now set for July, and if convicted, Williams faces suspension from office. On a gray, humid morning in December last year, Reeder appeared in the same courtroom where he was sentenced in 1995. The wooden public benches were almost empty and Reeder was appearing from Angola prison on a Zoom link. Members of Broxton’s family, including his mother, Mary Green, were present too. Reeder’s voice boomed into the cavernous open room as Judge Rhonda Goode-Douglas asked him to confirm his presence. “Yes ma’am,” he said, the words echoing off the walls. Myers and Sarma detailed the case before the judge. Myers described it as a “frightening example of prosecutorial misconduct” under the Connick era, before Sarma invited Green to address the court. Her soft voice bounced around the room. She spoke directly to Reeder, as he looked intently down the camera. “I’m speechless,” she said. “I don’t know what to tell you. Just how sorry I am that you had to … that you served this time. I just pray that life out here would … just … be a better life.” “Ms Mary, I’m sorry Mark is gone,” Reeder said. As Green continued to apologize, Goode-Dougles intervened, telling her not to blame herself. Later, she addressed both Reeder and the Broxton family. “It is this court’s sincerest apologies that this happened to both of you all: Mr Reeder, being wrongfully convicted and serving several years of your life in prison for a crime that you did not commit; and to the family of Mr Broxton … we could never bring back your loved one. And, unfortunately, the criminal justice system failed you during that time period. It is my hope that you are all able to make peace.” The judge tossed the conviction under Brady. The DA’s office dropped the charges. There was no way to ensure a fair retrial. Reeder’s three-decade period of incarceration ended by a court session lasting minutes. Sarma addressed the Broxton family directly. “We failed you,” he said. “We have an obligation to seek the truth, which is really hard to do. But we also have an obligation to tell the truth, which is much easier to do. And it’s something that we did not do in this case for nearly 25 years. “We have come clean today.” He turned to Reeder. “I would also like to apologize to you, Mr Reeder, on behalf of the state of Louisiana. I know it’s been 28 years long, and today you’ll get to go home a free man not facing these charges any more.” The court adjourned as sobs dissipated into the open air. Reeder became one of six exonerations the Orleans parish civil rights division secured within its first 12 months. Later that afternoon, Reeder walked out the gates of Angola prison, clutching two small bags with his possessions. Vanessa Scott, his wife, sat inside her car waiting for him. “Come on king,” she called to him as he walked towards her in the drizzle. They hugged each other in a way that had not been possible since they were teenagers. “It was shocking … hugging her on the other side, knowing we were about to start our life again together,” he said. As they drove back home, along the winding country highway, they stopped at a church on the roadside, he recalled. The doors were locked, so Reeder bent down on the steps in the open air and prayed. “It felt like I was immortalized or something,” he said, sitting in New Orleans a few weeks later, giving his first ever interview to a journalist. “You know that whole feeling in your body changes when you know you’re free. I felt everything come off me. “I’m too overjoyed to be angry. I’m too overjoyed at being free.”",News/US news,Inside the Division: how a small team of US prosecutors fight decades of shocking injustice,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/06/prosecutors-new-orleans-mass-incarceration
5/6/2022,"Xi Jinping has confirmed there is no intention to turn away from China’s zero-Covid commitment, in a major speech to the country’s senior officials which also warned against any criticism or doubting of the policy. Addressing the seven-member politburo standing committee, China’s highest decision-making body, specifically about the Shanghai outbreak, the president said China’s response was “scientific and effective”. He told officials to “unswervingly adhere to the general policy of dynamic zero-Covid”. “We have won the battle to defend Wuhan, and we will certainly be able to win the battle to defend Shanghai,” he said, according to a translation by Sinocism’s Bill Bishop. China is the last major economy still committed to a policy of containment and elimination of the virus, despite the increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant, which has overwhelmed other previous zero-Covid jurisdictions. It has largely stuck to the measures employed throughout the pandemic – lockdowns, mass testing and movement restrictions based on health codes. But a weeks-long lockdown in Shanghai sparked a major crisis with food shortages and delivery bottlenecks for the 25 million residents, and major business and economic impacts. It also prompted an unusual outpouring of criticism and protest, including on the merits of persisting with zero-Covid against Omicron. In his address on Thursday, Xi appeared to send a message to those wavering, to resolutely oppose all distortions, doubts and denials. “We will resolutely struggle against all words and deeds that distort, doubt and deny our epidemic prevention policies.” Xi’s address also called out “problems of inadequate understanding, inadequate preparation and inadequate work [and] resolutely overcome the ideas of contempt, indifference and self-righteousness”. An analysis of the speech by the China Media Project said the language should be seen as “a direct criticism of unspecified local CCP leaders who have questioned the policies at the centre, or who have been insufficiently successful in applying them”. “And it is difficult not to hear in this phrase about ‘self-righteousness’ a condemnation of leaders in Shanghai in particular,” it said. Health experts agree with Chinese authorities that vaccination and booster rates are too low, and health resources too inequitable across regions for the country to risk opening up. However, analysts say the zero-Covid policy is now so entrenched in the political legitimacy of the Chinese Community party and Xi that even when conditions change there is no way out, barring a major and potentially damaging backdown. On Friday China reported 4,696 cases, including 4,269 in Shanghai and 70 in Beijing. Henan province, where the capital of Zhengzhou just went into lockdown, recorded 79. Economists have forecast a worsening economy if Shanghai-style lockdowns continue. One analyst this week projected it would cost US$257bn, or 1.5% of China’s 2021 GDP, by the end of the year if every tier-1 city employed the thrice-weekly testing regime currently operating in Beijing and other places. The five-day labour day holiday, which ended on Thursday, saw a 43% year-on-year reduction in tourism spending. Rail journeys were down by more than 70%. In the capital, Beijing, authorities have resisted a city-wide lockdown, instead imposing movement and transport restrictions, activity and venue shutdowns, and lockdowns of individual residential compounds. It has ordered people from some districts to work from home, and reopened mass quarantine centres to house mild and asymptomatic cases.

5/6/2022,"Australians’ wages are set to shrink as much as 3% in 2022 as salary increases lag behind inflation and may only start to catch up by 2024, the Reserve Bank has said. In its quarterly statement on monetary policy, released on Friday, the nation’s central bank raised its expectations for price increases while trimming some GDP growth forecasts. Australia’s economic growth is now expected to slow to 3.5%, down from 4.2% for 2021 and lower than the 5% predicted in the February statement. Growth will quicken slightly in the second half of 2022 to 4.25% before slowing again to 2% by December 2023. For now the RBA is tipping wage price index (WPI) growth of 3.75% by mid-2024, when it would outpace the consumer price index growth of 3%. By December this year, CPI should peak at 6%, twice the pace of the forecast 3% wages growth. While the Reserve Bank is lifting its predictions for the wage price index (next ABS instalment due May 18th), it's clearly going nowhere near the annual CPI peak expected near 6% later this year. (Source: CBA) pic.twitter.com/gzrDxu3p9J “Despite low unemployment rates, wages growth has not kept pace with inflation, so real wages have declined – in some cases noticeably,” the RBA said, referring to conditions in many economies as price pressures rise globally. The bank noted labour markets in many economies were tightening, with Australia’s jobless rate in March at 4%, the lowest in 48 years. By early 2023, the rate is predicted to reach 3.5%. As workers “might seek larger wage increases to compensate for the loss of purchasing power”, it remains unclear how successful those efforts will be, and the resulting inflationary feedbacks. “These uncertainties are salient in Australia, where there is little recent experience of how the labour market and inflation might behave when unemployment is as low as it is currently,” the RBA said. Excluding the introduction of the GST in 2000, Australia’s 5.1% annual CPI for the March quarter was the highest since the mid-1990s. That spike, reported 27 April, prompted the RBA to lift its cash rate this week for the first time since 2010. Those rising prices – as well as the lagging wage increases – have stoked debate during the election campaign about the rising cost of living. The ABS will release the March quarter WPI on 18 May – three days before the election – with the real annualised decrease in wages likely to be in the order of two percentage points. Unions were quick to respond to the RBA’s statement, highlighting the forecasts of real wage cuts lasting until the end of next year. If the predictions are accurate, workers face 21 months of consecutive wage cuts, or half a year more than forecast in the federal budget released at the end of March. ACTU secretary Sally McManus blamed the government for “nearly a decade of low wage growth and inaction on job security”. “The Morrison government could be standing up for the wages of working people by supporting a pay rise for a quarter of all working people in the annual wage review, or supporting the wage case being run by aged care workers,” McManus said. The RBA notes inflationary pressures continue to mount in advanced economies, with rates of 6-9% expected during 2022, or 1-2 percentage points higher than predicted earlier this year. Other central banks started lifting cash rates well before Australia’s, including the US federal reserve earlier this week raising its key rate by 50 basis points, and the Bank of England raising its rate by 25 basis points on Thursday. Australia’s economy remains relatively resilient, though, aided in part by surging commodity prices that boost national income and bolster government coffers. The country’s terms of trade – which compare costs of imports versus exports – “are likely to reach a new peak in the first half of 2022 and thereafter remain generally higher than previously envisaged,” the RBA said. Coal used in power stations and European gas have jumped 30-40% since February, sent higher by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resultant sanctions. Bulk commodity prices were 11% and rural ones 12% higher over the period. A worrying look at food price changes today from @ANZ_Research ... with oils in particularly taking off. pic.twitter.com/cP3FwMvB44 Near-term growth in the economy would also be supported by non-mining investment as businesses continue to recover from Covid-related lockdowns, although supply disruptions continue for some products as regions of China clamp down again. Housing price growth has slowed further, with declines now recorded in Sydney and Melbourne, and auction volumes and clearance rates both dropping. “In most other capital cities and regional areas, price growth has moderated but remains strong, supported by a very low number of properties available for sale,” the RBA said. Across the past five years, Hobart’s prices are up 69%, or triple Sydney’s pace. Advertised rents, meanwhile, continue to be “strong in most states, reflecting low vacancy rates and strong income growth”, the bank said. Without the March WPI to work with, the RBA relied on “liaison contacts” to assess how much wage demands are mounting. While the majority of such feedback reported annual wages growth of 3%, there has recently been a “marked increase” in the share reporting wage rises of more than 3%. Without the March quarter wage price index - that lands on May 18th - the RBA based its wages assessment on feedback from companies. pic.twitter.com/dvpQclRfnw The bank’s further rate rise trajectory will hinge in part on how much people expect prices to rise. While surveys are picking up inflation expectations reaching the highest levels “in many years”, measures of longer-term expectations remain “around 2.5%, although expectations of union officials have picked up to around 3%, the highest level since 2012”, the RBA said. Bank governor Philip Lowe flagged earlier this week that the RBA’s cash rate target could reach 2.5%. The bank, though, noted the expectations of investors pointed to the rate reaching 2.75% by the end of this year, and 3.5% by the end of 2023. As of Thursday – prior to big falls in equities and other markets overnight – the cash rate expectations were running slightly higher than the RBA statement. While investors are having a hissy fit on overseas markets (with Australia to join in shortly), they are also punting on the cash rising to 1% from 0.35% by July, almost 3% by the year's end. #ausvotes #ausvotes2022 #auspol pic.twitter.com/jUrCdDSk3c Economists at CBA, Australia’s biggest bank, are more cautious, predicting the RBA will hike rates each month from June to August by 25 basis points, and again in November. The peak rate of 1.6% would be reached by next February and the RBA would stay put for the rest of the year. “In many respects the RBA’s 2023 forecasts should be taken with a pinch of salt,” the economists said in a briefing note. “We say that not so much because the RBA’s forecasting record more recently has not been particularly good,” the CBA said. “But rather because the economic outcomes we get in 2023 will be heavily dependent on what type of tightening cycle the RBA delivers.”",News/Australia news,"Real wages to fall by 3% this year as inflation surges, says RBA",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/real-wages-to-fall-by-3-this-year-as-inflation-surges-says-rba
5/6/2022,"The war in Ukraine is laying bare a generational divide over what lessons Germany should draw from its own history of waging bloody conflicts, as some of the country’s leading artists and intellectuals line up in favour of or against supplying Kyiv with weapons in a series of open letters. The first, published in the feminist magazine Emma on Friday last week, days after the German government announced it would send about 50 Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine, urged the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to refrain from directly or indirectly contributing further heavy weapons systems to the conflict. Signed by 26 prominent artists and intellectuals including Emma’s feminist publisher, Alice Schwarzer, the novelists Martin Walser, Juli Zeh and Robert Seethaler, the film-makers Andreas Dresen, Alexander Kluge and Helke Sander and the actor Lars Eidinger, the letter condemned Russia’s war of aggression as a “breach of the basic norms of international law”. Nonetheless, the letter argued it was a mistake to assume that the responsibility for Vladimir Putin’s war potentially escalating into a nuclear conflict “would lie purely with the original aggressor and not also those who with open eyes offered him a motive for potentially criminal acts”. The signees urged Scholz to heed Germany’s “historic responsibility” by helping the two sides find a “compromise that both can accept”. The letter drew some angry responses, including from the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany. The economy minister, Robert Habeck, accused Schwarzer and her co-signees of “vulgar pacifism”. “What is the conclusion of such an argument?” the Green politician asked. “It’s basically that a little bit of occupation, rape and execution should be acceptable and that Ukraine should capitulate swiftly. I don’t think that’s right.” Another open letter, published on Wednesday in the weekly broadsheet Die Zeit, expanded this counter-argument, urging Scholz to continue supporting Ukraine’s defence with military hardware. Initiated by the former Green politician Ralf Fücks and signed by 58 artists and intellectuals including the Nobel literature prize recipient Herta Müller, the pianist Igor Levit and the German PEN’s president, Deniz Yücel, the letter said preventing a Russian victory in Ukraine “lies in Germany’s interest”. “Those who want a negotiated peace that doesn’t result in Ukraine’s submission to Russian demands must increase [Ukraine’s] defensive capabilities and weaken Russia’s belligerency as much as possible,” it said. The Booker-nominated German novelist Daniel Kehlmann, who was another of the Zeit letter’s signees, told the Guardian he had been motivated to put his name to the appeal after seeing the “deep shock and horror” among his eastern European friends at reading the Emma letter. “It seemed to urge Ukraine to capitulate as quickly as possible to end the war,” Kehlmann said. “That may have been an understandable view on the first or second day of the invasion. Now the reality is different: there is a chance that Ukraine can win this war, and we have to support its defensive effort in any way we can, both for moral and tactical reasons.” Kehlmann said he felt some sympathy with German hesitancy at embracing martial rhetoric in light of its own violently aggressive past. “When Scholz announced that he would increase military spending, I too instinctively felt strange at the thought of supporting German armament,” he said. In a long essay published in Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on the same day as the Emma letter, the sociologist and philosopher Jürgen Habermas had framed the German debate over arms exports as a generational divide over applying “aggressively self-confident” and “shrill” language to a military conflict. A younger generation, personified to Habermas by Germany’s 41-year-old foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, had been “raised to exhibit sensitivity on normative questions” and only managed to “view war through the lens of victory or defeat”, he said. His own generation, the 92-year-old philosopher seemed to suggest, “know that a war against a nuclear power cannot be ‘won’ in the traditional sense of the word”. He said the “broad pro-dialogue, peacekeeping focus of German policy” was a “hard-won mentality” given its track record as an aggressively militaristic state, and which had been historically denounced from the right. But the ability of some Germans to look at the Ukraine war solely through the lens of their experience in the second world war has also drawn criticism. In a radio interview, Kluge, 90, announced that he had been happy to see US troops march into his home town in 1945 and that there was therefore “nothing evil about capitulation if it ends the war”. The interview was met with widespread disbelief for muddling up the historic lessons of an aggressor nation and those of states that had come under German attack. With an average age of 54, the signatories of the letter in Die Zeit are noticeably younger and have more multicultural backgrounds than those of the preceding letter in Emma, who average 76. “One of the lessons of German history has to be that you cannot defeat fascism with appeasement,” Kehlmann said. The novelist, whose grandparents were Jewish, added: “It is noticeable that the argument for a strictly pacifist foreign policy is rarely brought forward by Germans whose relatives died in the Holocaust.”",News/World news,German thinkers’ war of words over Ukraine exposes generational divide,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/german-thinkers-war-of-words-over-ukraine-exposes-generational-divide
