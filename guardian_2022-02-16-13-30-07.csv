2/16/2022,"Kristina Keneally says Labor will not oppose the Coalition’s visa cancellation bill in the lower house in a bid to sidestep what the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, admits is a “test for Labor”. On Wednesday the Morrison government confirmed it would relist two bills seeking to lower the bar for failure of the character test for visa cancellation and introduce mandatory minimum sentences for firearms offences.  The move seeks to sharpen the contrasts with Labor on national security, as Scott Morrison explained in the party room on Tuesday, in a bid to recover the government’s position ahead of the 2022 election. On Tuesday Labor’s caucus reserved its position on the strengthening character test bill, citing ongoing negotiation between Keneally and her counterpart, Alex Hawke. On Wednesday Keneally revealed Labor would not oppose the bill in the House of Representatives, claiming the government may need to amend its own bill because Hawke appeared concerned the provision used to cancel Novak Djokovic’s visa cannot be used against permanent visa holders in Australia. Hawke immediately ruled out government amendments. “Absolutely not,” he told reporters in Canberra. “The reason we’ve set this test for Labor is that Labor is, after two years of opposing this bill, seeking to run from the house and block it in the Senate.” Under current migration law, visas are automatically cancelled if a non-citizen is sentenced to 12 months or more in jail, but can also be cancelled if a person fails the “character test”. The proposed bill would lower the bar for the failure of the test so a person convicted of a “designated offence”, such as violence or breaching a court order, is deemed to be of bad character, making visa cancellation more likely, although a discretion not to do so remains. In October, Labor helped defeat the bill in the Senate, citing concerns that low-level offending should not be a trigger for deportation, retrospective application should be removed, and a ministerial direction should be issued to soften the impact on New Zealand citizens. Hawke told reporters there are “no trivial crimes captured by this legislation”. “The Morrison government will not negotiate over community safety … or serious and violent crime.” Hawke confirmed the government would also seek a vote in the Senate before the election, in the two sitting days in budget week at the end of March. Earlier, Keneally said Labor remained hopeful that concerns about “unintended consequences” will be addressed. “They’ve already made one change in response to our request, around low-level offending being inadvertently captured. “We support the ability for the minister to cancel visas on character grounds – we supported it in 2014. “For the past three years we’ve been trying to understand … what powers this gives the minister that he [doesn’t already have].” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Asked about harms to Australia’s relationship with New Zealand, where most people whose visas are cancelled are sent, Hawke said the cancellation policy was “non-discriminatory”. The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, defended the politicisation of the issue, arguing that Labor has “set a test for itself” by portraying itself as tough on national security with “very little evidence”. Andrews said Labor was so determined to present a “small target” in the election it was “folding in on itself”. The Greens confirmed on Wednesday afternoon that they would seek a division on the bill, which may force Labor MPs to vote in the chamber rather than pass the bill on the voices. Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said Labor should not help the Morrison government pass a bill that “will hurt people” including “splitting up families, many of who have lived here for years”. Bandt said the Greens were prepared to amend or block the bill in the Senate, but Labor appeared “scared” and prepared to fold and pass it. On Wednesday the government also introduced its firearms bill, which increases maximum sentences for trafficking and sets a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison for firearms offences. Labor has a longstanding opposition to mandatory sentences, opposing a similar measure in 2015 under the Abbott government, but the bill is yet to be reconsidered by the caucus.",News/Australia news,"Labor will not oppose visa cancellation character test bill, Kristina Keneally says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/16/labor-will-not-oppose-visa-cancellation-character-test-bill-kristina-keneally-says
2/16/2022,"It wasn’t the clean sweep of eight years ago, but a pair of Americans topped the men’s freeski slopestyle podium on Wednesday morning after Alex Hall soared to Olympic gold ahead of team-mate Nick Goepper, who took the silver. Sweden’s Jesper Tjader won the bronze ahead of Andri Ragettli, the defending world champion from Switzerland who qualified in first place but settled for fourth on another bitterly cold morning in the mountains roughly 120km northwest of Beijing.  Twelve entrants competed in the three-run final on Wednesday with the best score counting towards their final position. Hall, a 23-year-old born in Fairbanks, Alaska, wasted no time setting the target, putting down a spectacular opening run for a score of 90.01 that none of his rivals could approach. Goepper, who was bidding for a complete set of Olympic slopestyle medals after taking bronze in 2014 and silver in 2018, went into second with a score of 86.48 after the best of the middle attempts. Neither of the Americans could improve on their scores on their final trips down the 665-metre course filled with rails, jumps and obstacles and an eye-catching replica of China’s Great Wall. The drama persisted until the final run of the morning when Ragettli, who returned from an ACL injury to win slopestyle gold at last month’s X Games, was undone by a missed takeoff and shut it down. Hall, who was Alaska-born but raised in Switzerland while his parents taught at the University of Zurich and now lives in Salt Lake City, won slopestyle silver at the 2016 Youth Olympics, then bronzes at last year’s world championships and the X Games. Colby Stevenson, the 24-year-old from Park City, Utah, who returned from a near-fatal car crash that left him in a coma to win silver in big air last week, made a few too many mistakes on the upper rail sections on his final run and finished in seventh. That denied the Americans the podium sweep they achieved at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, when Joss Christensen, Gus Kenworthy and Goepper won the gold, silver and bronze, respectively. “Just making the Olympic team was such an honor after everything I’ve been through with the car crash,” Stevenson said. “It just seemed like stars had to align, and they definitely did.” He added: “I am so happy to show my stuff on the world stage and ski the way that I did. It wasn’t exactly what I wanted today, but that’s how it goes, man, when you’re laying it all on the line. Give it your best and make sure to have fun. You don’t want to get too upset if you don’t do well. We’re living it.” It marked the 20th time the United States has gone one-two in the history of the Winter Olympics and the first since the men’s freeski halfpipe in 2018.",Sport/Sport,Alex Hall and Nick Goepper claim US 1-2 in men’s freeski slopestyle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/16/alex-hall-nick-goepper-olympic-freeski-slopestyle
2/16/2022,"Traditional owners in the Northern Territory have launched a legal challenge against an “unconscionable” decision to grant the territory’s largest ever groundwater extraction licence to a Chinese-owned agribusiness company, saying the decision failed to consider Aboriginal cultural rights to the water. The NT government granted Fortune Agribusiness a free 30-year licence to extract up to 40,000 megalitres of groundwater a year from aquifers under Singleton station, about 400km north of Alice Springs.  It’s the largest private water allocation in the territory. The licence was originally granted in April but was reviewed after a challenge by traditional owners before being re-granted in November with slightly different conditions. The Central Land Council (CLC) on Wednesday filed a challenge against the decision in the supreme court on behalf of native title holders the Mpwerempwer Aboriginal Corporation, arguing that the decision contravened the NT Water Act and that minister Kate Worden failed to consider the Aboriginal cultural values. It is calling for the licence to be quashed. The CLC chief executive, Les Turner, said they would argue that Worden’s decision was “not even a proper decision because she left so many significant matters to be decided later”. “This uncertainty means that what Fortune Agribusiness is eventually allowed to do might be very different from what it proposed in its licence application,” Turner said. “The water licence decision is unconscionable considering the impacts of climate change on highly vulnerable desert communities.” The CLC has called on the NT government to halt all water licence allocations until the proposed review of the regional water allocation plan has been completed. Turner said the government lacked sufficient data about the aquifers to make such a significant water allocation, and that requirements under the revised licence issued to Fortune Agribusiness – that they carry out further investigations about the water resources at the site and complete an assessment of the impact of the groundwater extraction on “identified groundwater dependent cultural values” – was not sufficient. “We’re saying nothing should happen until the new plan is in place,” he said. “This includes Singleton. At the moment we need more knowledge and more science, more understanding of our aquifers and more respect for Aboriginal people. The government should not give away our water.” The case is happening against the backdrop of a national push to provide greater recognition of cultural water rights and strengthen water use rights under native title laws. Native title rights cover access to and use of water but do not provide water rights or use of water for commercial purposes. They are also extinguished by the granting of other commercial water licences. Turner said providing native title holders with concrete rights regarding cultural water flows would address many of the concerns of traditional owners. “There is all this talk about Fortune Agribusiness developing [the water resource] but Aboriginal people might want to develop it and produce stuff themselves,” he said.

In November, chairman Peter Wood said the company wanted to work with traditional owners to create “genuine social and economic benefits” and that the project was expected to create 100 permanent and 1,300 seasonal jobs.
