5/17/2022,"The government is concerned that the £4.25bn takeover of Chelsea could collapse because of Roman Abramovich’s alleged refusal to accept a new sale structure proposed by ministers. With the deadline for the deal to be completed less than a fortnight away Whitehall insiders have said there are fears of Chelsea going out of business. The government is determined that none of the proceeds from the club being sold to Todd Boehly’s consortium go to Abramovich, who put the European champions up for sale when he was hit with sanctions after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Chelsea, whose special operating licence expires on 31 May, require government approval before the deal goes through. But talks over what will happen to Abramovich’s £1.6bn loan to the club have stalled, heightening concerns over the deadline for the sale being missed. The government’s proposal is for a two-stage process that would see the £2.5bn from the sale to Boehly’s group go into an escrow account, where it would be held until it is satisfied the funds will go to a charity for victims of the war in Ukraine. But Westminster sources have said the deal has been held up by the club’s ownership structure. Chelsea’s parent company, Fordstam Ltd, owes £1.6bn to Camberley International Investments, a Jersey-based company with suspected links to Abramovich. The government has claimed that Abramovich and Chelsea want the loan repaid and then frozen before it goes to a charitable foundation. The government is insistent that would break the terms of the sanctions imposed on Abramovich. Whitehall insiders also say they are yet to see legal assurances that the money will not eventually end up going to the Russian oligarch and need guarantees the funds will reach good causes. Chelsea and a spokesperson for Abramovich have been approached for comment. Abramovich’s camp have previously denied claims that the billionaire could hold up the deal by reneging on his promise to write off his loan to Chelsea. Abramovich has insisted that the charitable foundation will be an independent organisation and will be run by the former head of a United Nations organisation with no previous connection to him. Chelsea have been represented in talks with the government by the club’s chairman, Bruce Buck, and the powerful director Marina Granovskaia. Buck and Granovskaia, both of whom have long-term ties to Abramovich, are expected to be retained by Boehly’s group.",Sport/Football,Chelsea sale in danger of collapse as talks over Abramovich loan stall,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/chelsea-sale-in-danger-of-collapse-as-talks-over-roman-abramovich-loan-stall
5/17/2022,"Great news, eh? The energy price cap will rise again in October and then there will be only another three months, rather than six, to wait until the next increase in bills. If that does not seem like an unalloyed benefit, Jonathan Brearley, the chief executive of Ofgem, would like you to remember that energy costs can fall as well as rise. The proposed shortening of the timetable for adjusting the price cap would mean “any price falls would be delivered more quickly to consumers”, he said. That is true, of course: the cap works off wholesale prices in the preceding period, so a faster recalculation will reduce the lag effect, whatever the direction of the move. This suits the energy regulator’s purposes, one suspects, because its next worry – when wholesale energy prices do eventually fall – is being blamed for delays in lowering bills. Quicker adjustments may marginally reduce the sense that prices go up like a rocket but come down like a feather. Does the switch make economic sense, though? Probably. But Ofgem would be wise not to overstate matters. There is a benefit to companies in the form of reducing their “volume risk”, as the jargon has it: if wholesale prices were to plunge suddenly, the worry in boardrooms is that customers, for whom energy has been bought at high prices, will desert for cheaper fixed-price deals elsewhere. But the gain for companies, which in theory should be passed on to customers, is not enormous. And a disadvantage for consumers is that new entrants could be discouraged. At this point in the game, we would probably settle for a market in which companies are able to cope with a bout of volatility without falling over like a pack of cards. Twenty-nine suppliers have collapsed so far, shoving about £2bn of cleanup costs on to billpayers. Yet a fiddle with the price cap, which may not have saved a single supplier, is only a minor change. Ofgem’s more important ideas for reform are those that will erect ringfences around customers’ deposits and ensure companies’ balance sheets can withstand financial stress. Those ideas remain the main regulatory event. Ofgem needs to hurry up the hard stuff that some suppliers will not like. The exit of McDonald’s from Russia turns the spotlight on those western consumer giants still continuing to operate in the country. One is Unilever, the Dove-to-Wall’s-ice-cream group. So it was intriguing to see its former chief executive Paul Polman pop on Twitter to laud the McDonald’s move as “courageous”. Polman did not join the dots to his old shop but others will. Why is Unilever still operating in Putin-land? The short answer is that the current chief executive, Alan Jope, takes the view that ceasing imports and exports to Russia, and starving the local operation of capital expenditure and an advertising budget, is a better response. Simply closing four factories would expose employees, especially local bosses, to punishment by the Kremlin, the argument goes. Unilever says it will not profit from its presence in Russia but “will continue to supply our everyday essential food and hygiene products made in Russia to people in the country”. Since one of the main products is a local ice-cream brand, the definition of “essential” is being stretched but you get the picture: Unilever’s defence is that it has responsibilities to its employees. But so, of course, does McDonald’s, which said it considered the “dedication and loyalty” of local staff and suppliers but concluded that some things were more important. In other words, operating in Russia is incompatible with being a grownup western business. Nobody should deny the complexities here but Unilever’s stance looks increasingly misguided and isolated. McDonald’s will seek to offload its Russian operations to a local buyer while retaining its trademarks. It is hard to understand why Unilever cannot do the same. For most consumers, a new sofa or kitchen table is a deferrable purchase, so one shouldn’t be surprised that the online furniture retailer Made.com is in the profits warning business. Yet the size of Monday’s alert was extraordinary. As recently as March, the company expected revenues to improve by 25-35% this year. Now its best outcome imagines no growth, and its “lower guidance” foresees a 15% decline. In the process, the arrival of profits (at an “adjusted Ebitda” level, note) has been deferred for another year. Since last year’s £775m flotation, the shares have fallen almost 75% in a straight line, more or less. They will find a floor eventually but the listing price was plainly an exercise in optimism. Made, then as now, has an innovative model that has much to prove.",News/Business,Fiddling with the energy price cap is the tip of the iceberg.

5/17/2022,"Owen Farrell is ready to make his return to the England fold this week with Eddie Jones announcing a squad to begin preparations for this summer’s tour of Australia on Tuesday but it remains to be seen if he will resume the captaincy. Farrell missed out on the Six Nations to undergo ankle surgery for the second time this season but he has demonstrated his form and fitness on his return to action with Saracens. Had Saracens won their Challenge Cup semi-final against Toulon last Saturday, Farrell would have been busy planning for another major final but Jones is able to pick from all 13 clubs for the camp, which runs from Sunday to next Tuesday, given there are no Premiership sides left in Europe. During the Six Nations, Tom Curry and then Courtney Lawes led the side and though Farrell’s absence was felt in a campaign that yielded just two victories, there are no guarantees he will return to the role. Lawes was thought to be in danger of missing Northampton’s run-in with a gruesome thumb injury that could have put his place on the tour in jeopardy but he has made a remarkable recovery. Though England suffered defeats by Ireland and France under his watch, the 33-year-old flanker is a popular leader among the squad. Henry Arundell, the 19-year-old London Irish full-back who scored a spectacular length-of-the-field try in the Challenge Cup earlier this month, is also expected to feature in a squad of around 36 players. Arundell is also eligible for Wales and Scotland but has represented England at age-group level and Jones recently visited London Irish to cast his eye over the teenager. Elsewhere, after the Sale scrum-half Raffi Quirke was ruled out of the summer tour with a hamstring injury, Leicester’s Jack van Poortvliet is thought to be under consideration for the Australia trip. Van Poortvliet has been carefully managed by the Tigers this season, making only six league starts and featuring predominantly from the bench, but has impressed the coaching staff and, like Arundell, has prospered at U20 level. The camp marks the start of England’s preparations for the three-Test series against the Wallabies. Whether Jones opts to select players such as Anthony Watson and Jonny May – both of whom are nearing their returns from long-term injuries – is likely to be indicative of his summer plans. It is unclear whether Ben Youngs will be available to tour but Jones is expected to go full throttle against Australia with the 2023 World Cup in France looming. There may be some fringe players included today/on Tuesday, however, with a view to the Barbarians match on 19 June, for which Premiership finalists will not be available. It is also thought that the England management has been monitoring Mako Vunipola, who has not played for his country at all this season, having been one of the senior players omitted in September. Vunipola has, however, only just returned to action with Saracens following an ankle injury so the mini-camp may come too soon for the 31-year-old loosehead prop. Curry sustained an ankle injury in Sale’s last outing against Racing 92 in the European Championship Cup quarter-finals but it is not thought to be serious.",Sport/Sport,Owen Farrell to make England return from injury but captaincy undecided,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/16/owen-farrell-to-make-england-return-from-injury-but-captaincy-undecided
5/17/2022,"Clad in a top hat and leaning nonchalantly on a Rolls-Royce, images of a besuited Ferdinand Marcos Jr from his time in Britain in the 1970s are as you may expect from the playboy scion of a kleptocratic dictator. Yet as the Marcos family returns to power in the Philippines after a landslide presidential victory by Marcos Jr, he is facing calls to stop misrepresenting the circumstances of his studies at Oxford. The university has confirmed that he did not complete his BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics after enrolling in 1975. “According to our records, he did not complete his degree, but was awarded a special diploma in social studies in 1978,” Oxford said in a response to a freedom of information request lodged by a UK-based Filipina supporter of Marcos Jr’s nearest rival in last week’s election. Marcos Jr, nicknamed “Bongbong”, has claimed in interviews that Oxford issued him with a bachelor’s degree, while his official spokesperson has said that the politician and his team “stand by the degree confirmation which was issued by the University of Oxford”. His website states: “He completed his undergraduate studies at Oxford University and graduated with a Special Diploma in Social Studies.” But Mira Edgcombe, a UK-based Filipina supporter of Marcos Jr’s rival Leni Robredo, who lodged the FoI request, said of Marcos: “He should stop misrepresenting his special diploma, which is clearly not a degree. It’s clear he did not complete undergraduate studies.” She added: “In the grand scheme of things it may not seem so important, as our constitution states that presidential candidates only have to be literate and be a citizen of a certain age. But it’s a big thing in the Philippines if you have studied abroad and people are impressed by that. What he has been saying about that is a reflection on his personality and character. It’s also a reflection of a pattern of disinformation that a lot of researchers have pointed out recently.” After years of rebranding its image, the Marcos family is back in power after the late dictator son’s apparent election last week. Ongoing counts on Friday also showed his political allies were set to capture most of the 300-seat House of Representatives and half of the 24-seat senate, which was up for election. Marcos Jr had more than 31 million votes in the unofficial count, with projections showing one of the strongest majorities in decades. The result comes after an onslaught of disinformation designed to revise history, enhance the reputation of the family and undermine their opponents. The issue about Marcos Jr’s Oxford degree first emerged seven years ago when his profile on the website for the Philippines senate stated that he had obtained an Oxford degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). Newly published letters last year revealed that the envoys for his father had lobbied senior figures at Oxford University’s St Edmund Hall to preserve the son’s academic career after he failed examinations on a number of occasions. After university, Marcos Jr became the vice-governor of his home province, Ilocos Norte, on the north-western tip of Luzon, at the age of 23, and later governor. He was 29 when his father – who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989 – was ousted and the family was forced to leave the Philippines. Previously published documents revealed that Marcos failed two of his three preliminary exams at Oxford in the summer of 1976, later doing only enough to pass one of the two resits – failing politics for a second time. Discussions followed between emissaries of Marcos Snr and John Kelly, the principal of St Edmund Hall, who was asked if they could “think of any special circumstances which would warrant the college departing from its normal rule”. A deal was eventually hammered out in which Marcos was allowed to continue his PPE studies but was transferred to a special diploma in social sciences, a programme that has since been discontinued. Marcos Jr is not the only famous person to have presented a well-seasoned CV. Gillian McKeith, the You Are What You Eat presenter, agreed in 2007 to drop the title Dr from her company’s advertising after a complaint to the industry watchdog. The complaint was brought by a Guardian reader who learned of McKeith’s academic credentials from a Bad Science column by Ben Goldacre. Andrea Leadsom, in the midst of 2016 Tory leadership campaign, published a revised CV after claims that she exaggerated her roles in a City of London career. Former colleagues claimed she had exaggerated the importance of her roles at Barclays and Invesco Perpetual. Mina Chang, a senior official in the administration of Donald Trump, was caught out in 2019 after flaunting a Harvard education that in fact amounted to a seven-week course in 2016. She was also found to have invented herself a role on a UN panel and even created a fake Time magazine cover with her face on it. Craig Butfoy was jailed in March for lying about his flying experience to get a job with British Airways. He also accused of giving false details on his CV, including that he had held a private pilot’s licence since 1998, and fabricated documents, including a training course certificate. Jeffrey Archer, the author and disgraced politician, was accepted for a one-year course at Oxford University’s Department of Education after claiming he had six O-levels and three A-levels. He actually had three O-levels, and no A-levels. The three A-levels that never were saw him accepted for a one-year diploma course at Oxford’s Brasenose college, yet he fostered the impression he did a full degree course. Lee McQueen won a six-figure job in June 2008 with Sir Alan Sugar in the of the BBC’s The Apprentice in spite of his claim that he had spent two years at university when he spent only four months there. Florin Roman resigned in December 2021 as Romania’s minister of innovation and digitalisation after an investigation by journalists who reported they found significant irregularities on his resumé and evidence he plagiarised from an academic paper.",News/Education,Ferdinand Marcos Jr urged to stop pretending he has an Oxford degree,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/16/ferdinand-marcos-jr-urged-to-stop-pretending-he-has-an-oxford-degree
5/17/2022,"The stark division between British private and state schools is widely recognised by many of those in the centre, as well as on the left of politics, as perpetuating a centuries-old class system. Over recent decades, evidence has piled up of the extent to which fee-paying schools function as a pipeline to elite universities. These in turn function as a pipeline to elite jobs, and the incomes and prestige that go with them. Status is handed down through the generations. This is the reason for the Social Mobility Commission’s existence. Narrowing the gap between the outcomes of private and state-educated children has been an aim of successive governments – although many of the policies pursued since 2010 have worked against it. The pandemic made this task harder. Last year’s GCSE and A-level results in England showed the gap between private and state schools getting wider. There was also a marked disparity between grades gained by pupils in London and the south-east, and the north of England. (Elsewhere in the UK, the SNP has been criticised for lack of progress on attainment.) Given the emphasis that Boris Johnson’s government has placed on levelling up, you might think cabinet members would support efforts at sharing out opportunities more evenly. So it was disappointing to see the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, appearing to criticise the record of top universities that have widened participation. Both Cambridge and Oxford now offer about 70% of places to state-school pupils, up from 62% (Cambridge) and 56% (Oxford) seven years ago. Cambridge’s vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Toope, said recently that the proportion of privately educated students would further decrease. But rather than signal approval, Mr Zahawi said admissions should be based on “merit and evidence”. The irony is that merit and evidence already inform current practice. Research has shown that state-school pupils outperform private-school peers in their degrees. This means there is an empirical basis for using contextual data in determining admissions, as Mr Zahawi himself has acknowledged. Given the vastly greater resources spent on the average private-school pupil, compared with the average state-school one, it would be misleading as well as unfair to treat A-level results as the only factor. And young people from fee-paying schools continue to gain a disproportionate share of places at top institutions. Their interests are championed by academics such as the Cambridge historian who said recently that white, privately educated boys are now “disadvantaged”. Mr Zahawi has won praise for his can-do energy since becoming education secretary. But a positive attitude is no substitute for policy. Given that council-run schools outperform academies in Ofsted rankings, the recent pledge to force all schools to join academy trusts looks reckless as well as over-familiar (having been tried before). The more urgent priorities ought to be England’s collapsing school buildings, with a budget for repairs currently being fought over with the Treasury, and further education and training, where rhetoric has still not translated into much needed investment. Cuts have led to teachers’ pay falling 9% in real terms over a decade, and contributed to worsening problems in retaining staff. Warm words about “great outcomes for every child” are all very well. When coupled with barbs at access initiatives, and lack of progress in other areas, they shrink to a soundbite.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the school divide: Zahawi fails a test | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-school-divide-zahawi-fails-a-test
5/17/2022,"According to a poll published in the United States earlier this month, one in three adults believes that an attempt is being made “to replace native-born Americans with immigrants in order to achieve electoral gains”. A similar proportion sees the cultural and economic influence of US-born Americans diminishing as a consequence. The vast majority of those holding these views are likely to be white. From being a fringe notion on the extreme right, “replacement theory” appears to be entering the bloodstream of mainstream political discourse in the US. This should be seen as an insidious, disturbing backdrop to the mass shooting that took place in Buffalo at the weekend. Payton Gendron, the teenage suspect, is charged with shooting 13 people – 11 of them black – in a supermarket in a black neighbourhood of the city. Ten died. The action appears to have been carried out alone, and the suspect reportedly posted an online “manifesto” in which replacement theory is melded with anti-black racism and antisemitic content and tropes. Most of its material seems to have been culled via solitary immersion in Reddit and far-right websites. Black people, read one passage, were equivalent to immigrants in that they “invade our lands … live on government support and attack and replace our people”. Buffalo joins Charleston, El Paso and Pittsburgh as a site of bloody tragedy, after murderous attacks by lone white attackers. Last year the FBI identified the lethal rise of far-right terrorism aimed at minority ethnic groups as the biggest domestic security threat to America. Inevitably, there will now be renewed focus on President Biden’s stalling gun control programme – the latest to come up against the seemingly insuperable intransigence of Congress and the influence of the National Rifle Association. This was the deadliest mass shooting in America in 2022, but also the 198th to claim the lives of four or more people since the turn of the year. Despite Mr Biden’s commitment to reform, improved background checks and a ban on the kind of assault weapon used in Buffalo seem as far away as ever. Social media platforms will also come under renewed and deserved scrutiny. But there is a wider political context that needs to be recognised. The post-Trump radicalisation of parts of the Republican right has led to the cultivation of demographic and racial anxiety, succouring extremist views. Explicit references to race or ethnicity are usually absent from such interventions, allowing plausible deniability. The Fox News political commentator, Tucker Carlson, who hosts one of the most popular cable news shows in the US, regularly ploughs this furrow: in one show last year, Mr Carlson argued that Democrats are seeking “the replacement of legacy Americans with more obedient people”, who are “newly arrived from the third world”. Channelling and perpetuating the Trumpian “build a wall” mindset, senior Republican politicians have also used the language of replacement and “invasion” in relation to the southern border. Proposals for immigration amnesties have been conspiratorially framed as a means to secure a permanent liberal majority in Washington. Meanwhile the caricature of “critical race theory” as a pro-black threat to white identity has incubated the fear of a kind of “replacement” from within. In the wake of the Buffalo shootings, Mr Biden said that hate “remains a stain on the soul of America”. The radical Republican right and their cheerleaders are coming perilously close to being its enablers.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Buffalo shooting: a wake-up call for the Republican right | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-buffalo-shooting-a-wake-up-call-for-the-republican-right
5/17/2022,"In the remote Northern Territory community of Ramingining, election day has already come and gone. The AEC polling booth visited the mostly Yolngu community, 500km east of Darwin in Arnhem Land, for a day last week. On the covered basketball court, a line of people stood patiently in 35-degree heat, to cast their vote in the electorate of Lingiari while CLP and Labor scrutineers looked on. Labor had star power on the court: NT senator, Yanyuwa woman Malarndirri McCarthy, was chatting with locals, in perhaps a sign of how worried the ALP is about the possibility of losing the seat for the first time. Lingiari is huge: 1.3m sq km, covering the entire NT outside of Darwin. It is named for the Gurindji leader Vincent Lingiari, who led his people in the historic walk-off at Wave Hill station in 1966, to protest for land rights and equal wages. Lingiari has been staunchly Labor since it was created in 2001. Retiring MP, Warren Snowdon has held the seat for the entirety of its existence. Snowdon is a territory icon, well known across all the bush communities where Labor dominates. His replacement, Tiwi woman Marion Scrymgour, is a former arts and environment minister in the Martin NT Labor government, and former CEO of the Northern Land Council. During the first weeks of the campaign, many of Labor’s corflutes pictured the two of them – Marion upfront, Warren over her shoulder – to reinforce their connection, presumably for bush voters. There are nine candidates running in the seat, but the race is between the two major parties. Damien Ryan is the CLP candidate, alongside Jacinta Price, whose move into the Senate is all but official. Both are prominent central Australians. Ryan has been the Alice Springs mayor for 13 years. He is campaigning on a platform of supporting business, infrastructure and “funding to grow our Pastoral, Agriculture, Mining and Tourism industry’s [sic]”, Ryan is popular among the locals of townships like Katherine, Tennant Creek and his hometown of Alice Springs, where the Coalition is hopeful he might win enough votes to get them over the line in Lingiari for the first time. Lingiari is one of the least populous electorates in the country, and divided along racial lines. According to the 2016 census, 40% of residents are Indigenous, living in remote and very remote communities, and while only about 40% of the eligible voting population is enrolled, the majority vote Labor. At the last federal election, Labor won 76.4% in votes taken by remote mobile polling teams. The CLP polls well in urban centres like Katherine and Tennant Creek, where Jacinta Price’s tough on crime stance is proving popular. Any election is a logistical feat in the NT, with the AEC relying on mobile polling teams travelling by plane, boat and 4WD, to collect votes in Fifo visits to remote communities like the one at Ramingining. But these blink-and-you’ll-miss-it voting opportunities are a big reason why voter turnout in the bush is so low. Postal voting is almost non-existent, and if people are away from home – for funerals, health business, ceremonial business or visiting family, they often miss their chance. The morning after Ramingining’s election day, AEC officials were heading to the Wulkarimirra outstation, about 20 minutes drive north-east towards the Arafura coast, on a corrugated dirt road, to set up the mobile polling booth.

5/17/2022,"When Antoinette Lattouf’s father suggested she pursue hairdressing instead of journalism, he warned people may not like a woman like her. “Especially not one who has so many opinions,” he had said. In her nonfiction debut, the Australian journalist responds with the benefit of hindsight: “Dammit, dad. Maybe you were right.” How to Lose Friends and Influence White People was borne of changing times. The Black Lives Matter movement landed on Australian shores in 2020, and Lattouf, co-founder of Media Diversity Australia and former Network 10 reporter, sensed a shift in public awareness and an appetite for change. “People are looking and listening who had ignored the issue before,” she says. And her book, which plays off Dale Carnegie’s 1936 How To Win Friends and Influence People, capitalises on that. “Times have changed,” Lattouf says. “Every right has had to be fought for and negotiated.” Her guide speaks to both white Australians and people of colour, teaching readers to be better advocates and push back against institutionalised racism. Lattouf parcels up data with her own experience as a daughter of Lebanese refugees. She turns to the expertise of other diverse media thinkers and advocates, such as Benjamin Law and Celeste Liddle. And a deft list of dos and don’ts summarises each chapter. (On how to be a white ally, for instance, “Do … ensure your allyship is not just superficial,” and “Don’t … say ‘I don’t see colour’ – unless, of course, you are clinically colourblind.”) It’s a searing, witty, meticulously crafted manual to anti-racism, feminism, advocacy, power, relationships and individual responsibility. But the process of writing was not without pain. Personal stories hurt, data was sobering and revisiting memories of her own journey triggered trauma, Lattouf says. “There were times I was sitting there and sobbing, ugly crying,” she says. For instance, in chapter eight – Letting go of friends, family and unexpected foes – Lattouf opens up about opposition to her work by people she considered mentors, allies and friends. In 2020, Media Diversity Australia released its report Who Gets To Tell Australian Stories? It was the first comprehensive dataset to reveal the woeful lack of representation on television news, and Lattouf had expected backlash from divisive commentators or networks analysed in the report. What she didn’t expect was public criticism from people she thought were on side. It’s easy to block nameless, faceless people online, she says. “But it is hard to be let down by the people you care about.” In the book she cites data that found Indigenous women are 32 times more likely to be hospitalised because of family violence, and that a person is three times more likely to get a callback for a job application with the name Adam than with the name Mohamed. She points to problems with diverse representation in the media, legislature and government. Australian institutions “fall short when you look and see that all our pillars of power are white”, she says. “The most damaging racism is structural racism that doesn’t allow non-white people in Australia to fully participate and have safety, access to power and a voice in our democracy.” Lattouf brings forth a lineup of case studies, from Adam Goodes to Yumi Stynes, to show what happens when non-white people speak out on racism, religion and equality. The Sydney Swans player was targeted by what Lattouf calls a character assassination by media, after he called out a racist remark from the crowd at a game in the AFL’s 2013 Indigenous round. That prompted an instant plummet in the player’s popularity, and ended in Goodes walking away from his career two years later. An Anzac Day Facebook post in 2017 ultimately led to Sudanese Australian writer Yassmin Abdel-Magied losing her media job and leaving the country after copping torrents of abuse. Most recently, the discovery of ABC journalist Fauziah Ibrahim’s anti-Labor Twitter “shit-lists” saw her vanish off TV screens. Lattouf says that when a white media commentator makes a controversial comment – such as Prue MacSween saying on 2GB that “I would have been tempted to run [Abdel-Magied] over”, or Alan Jones’s many “offensive highlights” – they are free from front-page critiques, offensive cartoons and exile. But for people of colour, “the bandwidth to fail is much smaller … lives and careers can be ruined,” she says. Lattouf says precedent “definitely has a silencing affect” that leaves people asking: “Why would I want to try and stick my neck out?” “Speaking out is scary … At an individual level, as a mother and a woman of colour.” She reflects on the fallout following Abdel-Magied’s Facebook post. “I feel so bad I never stood up for her,” she says. “I was scared that what happened to her would happen to me, and I didn’t have enough power to really change anything.” One survival mechanism for Lattouf has been “banding together” with other people of colour in media and activism, including Mariam Veiszadeh and Stynes. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Thanks to practical advice she has picked up from them, Lattouf avoids revealing her location on social media, protects her children’s identity from the public and makes mental health a priority. (“Do … remember that exposure to racism can have long-term mental health impacts. Don’t … worry about people who are strongly opposed, as they will do little more than wear you down.”) “I guess for me I had to really practise what I preach,” Lattouf says. That also meant shining a “pretty scrutinising light” on communities that, on the surface, seem allied or subject to racism themselves. In her own Arabic-speaking community – who “got a taste of what it was like to be unfairly treated” – Lattouf notices a lateral anti-blackness. She calls it being “off white”. “There is a pecking order of racism … for people like myself, who are neither black nor white. “These migrant and refugee communities think that if they try to be white-reaching, they will get a free pass,” she says. “It is a false sense of security.” (On how to avoid being off white: “Do … use your proximity to whiteness to support rather than denounce other people of colour.

5/17/2022,"Perhaps Douglas Adams had it right. People who want to rule are the least suited to doing it; anybody capable of getting themselves elected should never be allowed to do the job. Nevertheless, election season is once again upon us. For political hopefuls and staffers nation-wide, it is time to answer hard questions. What wins more votes: making speeches, kissing babies, or digging holes? In the past, economists would have told you that making speeches about policy was the ticket to winning an election. Let’s say that every person has some innate political preference – left, right or somewhere in between. The argument was that people vote for the party who is the closest to their position. Over time, Australians have become more likely to identify strongly with one side or the other. Yet it is still true that we are most likely to be centrists, and sit on the fence – at least in our own reckoning. Suppose that politicians and parties are power hungry: they have the sole aim of getting in to parliament, and staying there. If that’s the case, in a two-party system, a party’s best bet is to squarely align its policy platform with the median Jill (or Joe). If both parties get the memo, then their strategies will end up making them close enough together as to be borderline indistinguishable. If we look at the 2019 federal election, this would imply that both major parties should have had policies a little right of centre. The party perceived as being closer to that position should have won. Yet – at least according to voters – neither party was all that close to the centre at all. What’s more, the ALP was perceived as being a smidge closer. This would have implied an ALP win. So the theorem doesn’t quite stack up. There are more than two parties. Our votes are more complex than left-right (even if we could agree on what they are). We place weight on different issues; speeches and policies aimed squarely at the middle are (sadly) not going to be enough. How about kissing babies? There are some things we can all agree on. For example: babies are cute. Chocolate is delicious. Politicians should be trustworthy. Good economic management is important. Alas, we can’t yet agree that good climate management is important too. So, scratch trying to figure out the right-of-centre tax policy that the median voter wants. Instead, work on convincing people that you’re good at the things they care about. This is why there’s so much focus whether a prime minister is “trustworthy”, “likable” or “competent”. It’s also why we care about which party is a better “economic manager”. Whether or not a particular party is actually good at something is almost irrelevant. The trick is to convince someone you are. Razzle-dazzle, as it were. Political parties seem to spend an inordinate amount of money on sparkles. This money can come from donations or private sources. It also comes from taxpayers. Any candidate who receives more than 4% of first preference votes gets reimbursed (in part) by the Australian Electoral Commission. Electoral funding has increased over the years. It shows no sign of slowing. To rub salt into the wound, political advertising does not need to be truthful. The only real requirements are to disclose who has authorised the ad, and not to mislead voters on how to vote. So – razzle-dazzle away! Does it win votes, though? It certainly plays a role. Yet it appears Australians aren’t easily hoodwinked. In a paper about the 2013 Rudd/Abbott election, researchers concluded that left-right alignment mattered more to Australian voters than views about leaders. In Britain, the US and Canada, the opposite seems to be true. It’s more likely some mix between the two. Alignment matters – hence the safe seat. But perceived competence can shift the dial, especially for fence-sitters. There’s no such thing as a sure thing. Politicians will always make gaffes, and no policy will ever be perfect. Making speeches while kissing babies is hard – and it’s easy to slip up. So if it’s a close race, parties bet on digging holes. Money comes out of the woodwork and seems to find its way miraculously to big infrastructure spends on marginal seats. These spends are often on worthwhile projects. Yet they are rarely aligned with national priorities. Like it or not, winning elections has as much to do with marketing as it has to do with economics. My hope is that Australian voters look beyond spin to substance. Work out the issues which matter to you, do some reading, and vote accordingly. Even if you feel like you’re choosing the lesser of evils, every vote counts. Jessica Mizrahi is an economic consultant and commentator.

5/17/2022,"Mount Isa has been named the most polluted postcode in Australia in a new report from the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF). The ACF said the outback city is one of four Queensland locations listed among the Top 10 most polluted postcodes in the country, alongside Gladstone, Stanwell and Tarong. The report was based on analysis of five pollutants of concern in the National Pollutant Inventory: sulfur dioxide, mercury, coarse and fine particles and oxides of nitrogen. Mount Isa hosts copper, lead, zinc and silver mines, with 17 facilities reporting pollutants of concern to the NPI. Mines in around the city emitted 400,000 tonnes of sulfur dioxide, 3,800 tonnes of oxides of nitrogen and 860kg of mercury and compounds in the air in the 2020/21 reporting period, according to the NPI. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Local residents told Guardian Australia that when they take their children to play at the local park, they can sometimes taste the sulfur dioxide blowing in from the copper smelter nearby. They also spoke of one occasion where a school assembly finished early because children were coughing due to fumes drifting into the grounds from a nearby mine. One resident – a former school teacher in the town, who did not wish to be named – said she decided to move away from Mount Isa last year when she fell pregnant. As an asthmatic, she said remembers times where she had to cover her mouth and nose while walking between buildings at work. Mount Isa Mines, operated by Glencore, is responsible for 91% of the postcode’s emissions, according to the ACF. Glencore said Mount Isa Mines has the “most intensive air quality monitoring network of any city in Australia”, as part of an “industry-leading” framework used to control emissions and dust at the source and prevent contaminates from escaping. “Mount Isa Mines is regulated by over 75 separate permits and authorities, with stringent and transparent reporting of environmental performance and we operate within our environmental limits for sulphur dioxide emissions and lead,” the company said. “Every resident of Mount Isa is within 1,200 metres of a sulphur dioxide monitor. Mount Isa Mines also engages openly about operations to ensure the community and stakeholders can stay informed.” Matthew Rose, ACF’s economy and democracy program manager, said sulfur dioxide is associated with “increased respiratory symptoms, difficulty in breathing and ultimately, for some people, premature death.” “Air pollution kills about 3,000 Australians every year and worsens conditions such as asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and other respiratory diseases,” Rose said. But he said Mount Isa was one of the few “polluted” postcodes in the country that does not host coal-fired power stations or coalmines. Muswellbrook in the New South Wales Hunter Valley, Traralgon in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, Collie in Western Australia and Queensland’s Gladstone, Stanwell and Tarong are all centres for coal burning, according to the ACF. Danielle Slade, the mayor of Mount Isa, said Glencore has a comprehensive system of emission capturing technology in place. “They probably have one of the most intense air monitoring networks in any city in Australia. It operates 24/7,” Slade said. Slade said the city’s copper smelter has an acid plant attached to it that captures all the fumes coming out of the stack. She said the copper smelter’s emissions are then turned into fertiliser. “There are some good, sort of green ways to turn to manage this,” she said. “Mining of these minerals is critical so that we can have electric cars, smartphones, smart TVs.” Slade acknowledged it was “very rare” to have a community living so close to a mine, but described moments where residents can taste sulfur as “isolated incidents” that occur only when the acid plant was down. “I grew up in Mount Isa and before the acid plant was here you could taste the sulfur. The mine’s been doing a great job to mitigate this,” she said. Queensland’s environment minister, Meaghan Scanlon, said the Environment Department “takes air quality very seriously and plays an active role in monitoring air quality across Queensland”. “Right now, the department reports and monitors close to 40 monitoring stations throughout Queensland, including in Mount Isa and in Gladstone, where we have installed eight monitoring stations,” Scanlon said. Scanlon said overall air quality has improved over the last three decades and remains “relatively good as a result of industry regulation, stricter emission standards for motor vehicles and new emission reduction technology.” But Rose said Australia needs new, nationally consistent air quality standards and a coherent national plan to transition to a clean energy future.",News/Environment,Australian Conservation Foundation names Mount Isa the most polluted postcode in the country,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/16/australian-conservation-foundation-names-mount-isa-the-most-polluted-postcode-in-the-country
5/17/2022,"There is a growing “electoral volatility” in western Sydney, with experts saying residents have “departed from the script” in a region which could prove critical to deciding the federal election. A new study from the Centre for Western Sydney that analysed federal election voting patterns found a level of volatility above national trends. Five of western Sydney’s 14 federal electorates are now marginal, with the report outlining a confluence of issues that are combining to alter the electoral landscape. The study found growing political literacy, combined with lower levels of education attainment, and higher rates of multilingualism, cultural diversity and religious faith have resulted in an unpredictable battleground. “Western Sydney’s quiet Australians are restless and its unlikely either of the major parties will be able to claim the region as its own for some time,” the report said. “Howard’s battlers and Labor heartland no longer, western Sydney voters are expressing a diversity in opinion at the ballot box to an extent that defies prediction and conventional political logic.” The report identifies five seats that could decide the election: Reid, Parramatta, Greenway, Lindsay and Macquarie. It says that while the region recorded swings against Labor three times the national average in the 2019 election, it was difficult to predict how voters had shifted since. The report warned parties against using “narrow-cast” messages or pursuing single-issue agendas. “Campaign pitches that ignore the region’s pronounced diversity, and seek to draw out divisions can just as easily disaffect voters seeking to connect with more balanced and informed messaging,” it said. The report cites faith-based campaigning as an example of narrow-casting in the region, with parties relying on polling data from the marriage equality plebiscite to guide them. The director of the Centre for Western Sydney, Prof Andy Marks said that while the region has higher than average rates of religious affiliation, it would be reckless to define the region that way. “It’s a dangerous game to play in, particularly in western Sydney when there’s a lot of interconnectivity across the region,” he said. “To focus on one issue suggests that people are able to separate out questions of faith from everyday living. And I suggest that that’s not the case in western Sydney. It’s not as though people can take themselves out of the fact that they have cost-of-living challenges or housing challenges, for example.” He pointed to the seat of Banks that was long held by Labor until David Coleman won it for the Liberals in 2013, in a change he says reflected a gradual lift in income levels and education levels. “When seats in western Sydney have drifted to Liberal over time, it’s been because of those factors like education, income, and not related to single narrowcast issues like religious space.” Marks said the Delta lockdowns in 2021, with many of the “LGAs of concern” being in western Sydney, had elevated local issues into election concerns. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I think the lockdown really focused people on those localised issues, with people concerned about maintaining housing, maintaining employment and so on,” he said. “The majority of people for example, in jobs like nursing, teaching and in healthcare, those essential jobs became so important during lockdown, and the bulk of those workers live in western Sydney and face a lot of uncertainty about rates of pay, contracts and just about cost of living more broadly.” Marks said the days of the region being a “stronghold” for either party is over, saying it could remain a battlefield for the foreseeable future. “I think that trend will only increase over time. And the consequence there is that neither party can take that region for granted,” he said. “And that’ll be tested at this election.”",News/Australia news,"Western Sydney’s time as a ‘stronghold’ for either major party is over, expert says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/western-sydneys-time-as-a-stronghold-for-either-major-party-is-over-expert-says
5/17/2022,"A bastion of conservative Christian politics, the electorate of Groom has become a frontline in the battle for the soul of the Coalition. And while religion barely rates a mention in the official campaign for Groom, there are concerns about the rising influence of pentecostalism, which could explain why the second safest seat in the country has suddenly become seen as one to watch. The headline factor has been Queensland’s only “voices of” independent candidate, social worker Suzie Holt, who is running against an incumbent on the right of the Liberal National party, mining engineer Garth Hamilton. Asked if she would have run if a LNP moderate was contesting the seat, Holt’s answer was a straight “no”. But another independent, nurse and small businesswoman Kirstie Smolenski, has run a campaign that is highly visible on the ground and is competing for the support of disaffected LNP voters. At the same time, refugee and women’s rights advocate Gen Allpass has run an unusually strong Labor campaign in an effort to prove the seat is “winnable” for her party, despite 120 years of evidence to the contrary. Groom and its predecessor, the division of Darling Downs, has been held safely by conservative parties since federation in 1901. The seat is centred on Toowoomba, a city of gardens and churches, perched atop the Great Dividing Range. In all, it covers 5,586 sq km of the Darling Downs’ rich volcanic soil, farming communities, a mushrooming network of coal seam gas mines and the New Acland coalmine. The LNP’s John McVeigh retained Groom at the 2019 election with more than 70% of the two-party preferred vote. Once president of the Young Nationals in Toowoomba, a city councillor and minister in the Newman state government, McVeigh – still in his 50s and on the back of such a commanding win in his second term as federal member – seemed destined to emulate the longevity of his father, Tom, who represented the seat in Canberra for almost 16 years. But despite the resounding electoral result, there were already signs of trouble in Groom. In 2017, McVeigh was among the 131 members of the lower house to vote “yes” for same-sex marriage. But a narrow majority of the Groom electorate, 50.8%, voted “no” in the preceding national postal survey. That led Isaac Moody, a Toowoomba businessman associated with the pentecostal Highlands church, to take on McVeigh at the 2018 preselection. He lost, but factional contests flared into the public again in September 2020, when McVeigh resigned citing family reasons. A crowded field of candidates jostled to replace McVeigh. Hamilton slipped under the radar, yet the mining engineer emerged victorious. Although Hamilton was not so well known, his articles for Spectator Australia and the guests at his campaign launch, senators Matt Canavan and Amanda Stoker, placed him at the right of the party’s spectrum. Holt said it was at this time she decided to throw her hat into the ring. The independent stresses her blue-ribbon credentials. Her mother was a founding member of a Liberal party branch. Her grandfather claimed to have encouraged Joh Bjelke-Petersen into politics. Holt said she was a supporter of McVeigh, a “lovely fellow”. But she worried about who would fill his seat in 2020. “I was very concerned where the local Liberal party was heading and its swing to the very hard right,” Holt said. Allpass had also watched with alarm the “big push of the pentecostal right” in Groom. She too described the preselection as the catalyst for her campaign. Smolenski said she had found the result “baffling” – and one that gave her an opportunity at an unlikely victory. “People just don’t know who Garth is,” she said. Hamilton said his wife was from Toowoomba, and the couple moved to her home town in 2016 to raise their children. He said the line that he was “not from here” was an “incredible accusation” from those who “trumpeted” the rights of refugees and one that demonstrated the “hypocrisy at the heart of these candidates”. Asked about a shift to the right by the LNP in Groom, Hamilton said he was not going to respond “to baseless anecdotes”. The attacks on Hamilton are unlikely to be anywhere near fatal to his chances at this election if a recent News Corp-commissioned poll is to be believed. Last week’s YouGov poll had Hamilton on track for a primary vote of 48%, compared to Allpass’s 24%. Holt, Smolenski and the Australian Federation party candidate Ryan Otto would share just 6% of the vote. But a senior member of the LNP in Groom, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they hoped the party could “find its way”, said 2022 was not necessarily the election at which the party’s “lurch to the right” could cost it. They said Hamilton would easily retain the seat at this election. “What I’m worried about is what happens next time,” they said. “We’ve seen all these seats, Kooyong, Wentworth, Warringah, Curtin, Mackellar, that all these previously blue ribbon seats could be lost.” Holt is already claiming victory in her campaign for Groom. “We wanted to put Groom on the national agenda,” she said. “And we’ve already won.”",News/Australia news,Pentecostalism and the LNP’s fight for its soul in Queensland’s Darling Downs,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/pentecostalism-and-the-lnps-fight-for-its-soul-in-queenslands-darling-downs
5/17/2022,"Ask a visible mender to explain why they love to repair clothes using patches or colourful darning and the response will usually include storytelling. Most menders pride themselves on adding to the history of a garment: a cleverly patched hole is evidence of something saved from landfill. They’ll also insist it shouldn’t be perfect. The charm of the visible mend lies in the character of its flaws, so the important thing is to have a go. Here is some advice from expert visible menders on how to get started. Like anything crafty, it’s important to have the right tools on hand when you go to repair something. Jo Cramer, an associate professor in the Department of Art and Design at Oslo Metropolitan University says, “You don’t need much to get started”. She suggests having a darning needle with a sharp point and large eye, a good pair of fabric scissors, a packet of pins, some embroidery threads, and an iron and board. Eileen Braybrook, a textile design and craft practitioner, says her mending toolbox contains a simple sewing kit, yarn or thread, a darning mushroom, some safety pins, a fabric comb and a needles for tapestry, felting and embroidery. Most visible menders also collect scraps of fabric to use as patches later. Before you try to do a repair on your favourite sweater, it might be wise to master a few basics. Erin Lewis-Fitzgerald, the author of Modern Mending, recommends practising stitching, darning and patching on socks and tea towels because the “stakes are low, and they’re washed and used regularly, so you can see how your mends hold up over time”. She advises using contrasting thread so it’s easier to see what you’re doing. When you’re just getting started, Cramer suggests learning how to do a backstitch, which is a straight-line stitch. Simply thread up a needle, knot the end of the thread and push it through the fabric until you feel the knot hit, then make a small stitch and push the needle back through. On your next stitch, pull the needle up, leaving a small space between the end of your first stitch, and then stitch backwards (hence the name) so you poke the needle through at the closest end of the original stitch. You should have two neat stitches on one side, and one long stitch underneath. Repeat this to form a straight line. Another thing Cramer recommends mastering is a satin stitch. Used for embroidery, each stitch is done as close to the one beside it as possible, creating a block of stitches. A satin stitch can be a useful way of covering up small stains. Cramer says, “stitch a border around the perimeter of the stain” using a back stitch, then fill the shape in with a satin stitch or other decorative stitch types. Lewis-Fitzgerald says another way to cover stains creatively is by using fabric paint or markers. “Depending on the stain’s location, you could stitch a new pocket over it and get some added functionality, too.” Like stains, there are multiple ways to repair holes, including darning and patches. But Lewis-Fitzgerald says you need to account for what caused the hole. If it’s the result of “regular wear and tear”, you will need a stronger solution than one you’d employ if it’s the result of a one-time accident like a cigarette burn or a moth hole. For crotch holes in jeans, Cramer recommends machine darning, which requires a sewing machine. “Put a patch of thick cotton or denim behind the tear and machine darn over the surface,” she says. “Check your machine’s manual – [it] probably has a special darning stitch.” Holes in knees can be taken care of with a Sashiko hand stitch over the top of a patch. A Sashiko stitch is essentially a running stitch, but when done with a contrast thread it can be used to create pretty or geometric patterns across the patch. She suggests searching online for examples to draw inspiration from. Cut the patch to the desired shape and pin it into place over the hole. Take a threaded needle – starting a few centimetres from the edge of the hole to capture sturdy parts of the fabric – and push the needle through from the underside of the fabric. Either run a stitch around the edge or simply begin by stitching across the patch. Continue working back and forth across it until the patch is secure. Knitwear has to be approached differently. For reinforcing patches in knits, start at the bottom of the V-shape in the stitch, bring your needle up through the base of the stitch from the back, then loop it under the two strands of yarn that make up the shape of the V. Pull it through, and complete the stitch by poking the needle back through your starting point at the bottom of the V. The effect is to weave new stitches over the top of the old ones, and the technique can also be used to cover stains. To repair a hole, Cramer says to use Swiss darning as a “method of picking up the loops around the edges of a hole and filling in with new stitches”. She says to try contrasting colours. “This can be particularly pretty when moth holes are filled in across a jumper in lots of different colours - like a sprinkle of confetti!”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Patch me if you can: how to mend clothes – creatively,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/17/patch-me-if-you-can-how-to-mend-clothes-creatively
5/17/2022,"Undecided voters will play a key role in deciding the outcome of Saturday’s election with many waiting until the final week, days, or even hours, to make their decision. So what in this very long, and at times messy, campaign has cut through? And how has it shaped people’s vote? We spoke to five undecided voters to find out. Bob lives in the bellwether seat on Bass in northern Tasmania, which is one of the most marginal in the country. Held by Liberal Bridget Archer with a 0.4% margin, Bass is known as an “ejector” – for the last 10 federal elections, only once has a sitting member been returned. Bob is a classic swing voter – previously backing Labor, the Liberals and even the Greens. He sums up the last six weeks as “poisonous pamphlets and pork”. “There are two things – one is there is a lot of ridiculous promises and I doubt it will all get funded,” he said. “And two – it’s a dirty campaign, I’m getting all manner of propaganda.” Last time around the ALP’s policy on franking credits sent him flying into the arms of the Liberals, and he says if Archer ran as an independent he would vote for her again – but he doesn’t want to see the PM keep his job. “I don’t mind Archer but I don’t particularly want to see the Liberal government get back in,” he said. “It’s like being run by a bunch of North Shore prefects.” Racheal Bender also lives in Bass. It will be the first time the 19-year-old votes in a federal election. “I am stumbling in the dark on who to vote for,” she said. “I don’t follow the news or politics so I really have no idea.” When asked if any campaign moments had cut through Bender said she would not have noticed an election was taking place if it wasn’t for the pamphlets. “​​Only the ‘don’t vote for Scott Morrison’ flyers and videos,” she said. “Bridget Archer has sent something also.” She said her values as a Christian would probably guide her vote, and that she would talk to her family before Saturday, but that she had not been interested in the campaign. “I’m not even sure the candidates are even telling the truth,” Bender said. Harry, 31, who did not want his real name used, lives in Grayndler – Anthony Albanese’s inner-city Sydney seat. For his whole life he has voted Labor, and until recently was a member of the party. This time around, he’s considering the Greens. “I am undecided,” he said. “I’m in Albo’s seat and I don’t want to vote Labor but don’t really know the Greens candidate enough, so am torn.” Harry said he started thinking about shifting his vote when Albanese “sold out the working class to get old white people’s votes”. “They parachuted white people into multicultural seats, have an absolutely shitty housing policy and the nail was when they rejected an increase to welfare,” he said. Tennile Hohaia is going the opposite way. The 39-year-old lives in Chisholm, in Melbourne’s east. It’s a key seat held by Liberal Gladys Liu by just 0.5%. “I’ve always voted Liberal,” Hohaia said. “[But] I’m undecided because I agree with the policies and I’ve always agreed but I can’t with a good conscience vote for Scott Morrison.” Hohaia runs a small business and says she has always benefited from Liberal governments, but she doesn’t like the PM for three key reasons. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I don’t like his public comments, I don’t like the way he takes no accountability and Julian Assange,” she said. “I feel like nobody cares about him [Assange].” Hohaia said the Liberals have run a strong advertising campaign. “‘It won’t be easy under Albanese’ is one of the most catchy slogans I’ve ever heard,” she said. Despite this, she is leaning towards Labor, but the vote is not in the bag. “I went to early vote last week and I didn’t because I wasn’t sure. I honestly care about this.” On the mid-north coast of NSW, Cowper runs from Port Macquarie to Coffs Harbour. It’s a safe National seat with the local member, Pat Conaghan, holding an 11.9% margin. Newly minted Australian citizen Meagan Adams comes from the US. She said it had been “cute” watching Australians complain about a six-week campaign when the US has one of the longest election periods on offer. In the US she was an active member of the Republican party until the Tea Party movement, but her conservative politics have not translated to a natural vote for the Coalition. “I’m finding it hard to believe any of the leaders know what’s going on [on] the ground,” Adams said. “I know we don’t vote for the leaders but at some point in time, the leader narrative takes over.” The defining moment for her first Australian election was Morrison saying he had empathy, after his comment about not holding a hose in the 2019-20 bushfires. “Scott Morrison’s comments about empathy cut through in the wrong way,” she said. “I don’t agree with Labor’s policies, particularly with house prices and childcare, but I feel like they at least put in the effort.”",News/Australia news,‘Poisonous pamphlets and pork’: what messages are cutting through to voters in this messy campaign?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/poisonous-pamphlets-and-pork-what-messages-are-cutting-through-to-voters-in-this-messy-campaign
5/17/2022,"Grace Shaw’s best lyrics are delivered with a shrug. When she released her first EP as Mallrat at age 17 (2016’s Uninvited), she immediately joined the pantheon of musicians cataloguing the existential malaise of the suburbs. But unlike her forebears – Lorde, say, or Arcade Fire, who elevated mundanity into grand narratives of nostalgia and loss – Shaw always maintained a healthy distance. “Get me off the list,” the Brisbane-born, Melbourne-based artist repeats ad nauseam on the EP’s title track, an early hit. You can hear the eye-roll in her disaffected speak-sung vocals as she drifts through yet another high school party, casting judgment from the fringes. Not that she’s immune to sentiment entirely. As her popularity swelled, so did the size of her choruses, revealing a coy vulnerability beneath the veneer of detachment. Her next two EPs spawned unusual successes; Groceries, a declaration to a lover invoking the produce aisle as a proxy for intimacy, landed in the top 10 of that year’s Triple J Hottest 100 – a feathery, tongue-in-cheek pop track that sounded like little else in the countdown. A follow-up single, the piano ballad Charlie, went even bigger, appearing on both James Corden’s late-night show and The Sims 4 (in the game’s classic garble, no less). Hearing the song stripped of context and chanted at full volume by live crowds feels incongruous with its content – about family dysfunction and domestic dreams – but it’s also testament to Mallrat’s unique sleight of hand: a disarming charm which paints all things, even pain and heartbreak, as merely facts of life. Butterfly Blue, her long-awaited, frequently brilliant debut album, arrives three years after her last EP. In that time, she moved to LA and back again, her plans scuppered by lockdown. It’s tempting to reach for the album’s easy metaphor: Mallrat returning home from international acclaim, reborn from a chrysalis, now more confident and fully formed as one of Australia’s most compelling, idiosyncratic popstars. Thematically, though, the album reads less like a complete metamorphosis than a quiet progression of Shaw’s persona. It’s clear she’s moved on from teenage disdain, across the 11 tracks that circle the contours of love in all its forms – unrequited, all-consuming, fleeting. . But the shrugging nonchalance is still there, as she dispenses cutting home truths as offhand remarks. “I’m being such a freak, I’m sorry,” she apologises on the love song Heart Guitar. Later, on Obsessed, the sentiment repeats: “I must be looking like such a creep.” Mundanity – and its coexistence with the sublime – remains a core fixation. Heart Guitar begins with Mallrat listing the trivial observations underscoring a great love: “I hear your footsteps / Know how your keys sound when you’re getting close.” Meanwhile, on To You, she makes a simple plea sound transcendent. “Holding on to you,” it goes, her voice melting into a rare, gauzy falsetto, “is all I want to do.” Her plain admissions allow her leeway to venture into territory that would sound jarring in the hands of a more tortured performer. The buzzy single Surprise Me is a standout: a canny collaboration with rap’s enfant terrible Azealia Banks, whose provocations – everything from a Louis CK namecheck to the comparison “tighter than Nicole Kidman face” – mesh unexpectedly well with Mallrat’s more restrained verses. There’s also a new throughline to her work: a fuzzy, blown-out guitar that pulls from dream pop and pop-punk to colour tales of giddy crushes and shattering break-ups with the Vaseline-lensed blur of recollection. At its best, Butterfly Blue evokes a melange of memories dissolving into one another, like the futile attempt, upon waking, to cling on to a dream that is rapidly slipping away, no matter how vivid and sweet it once seemed. A stream of turbulent images – standing on the roof, breaking into cars – runs through I’m Not My Body, It’s Mine, the album’s emotional crux, culminating in a cathartic outro filled with discordant guitar licks and distorted vocalisations. It’s as if the clear-eyed honesty of Charlie has been put through a tumble dryer, spitting out an impressionistic self-portrait of debauchery and wild, galvanising freedom. Elsewhere, the haziness is less successful. Arm’s Length, a stripped-back dedication to a crush who won’t commit, is too thinly sketched to be much more than filler. The title track, too, sacrifices Mallrat’s trump card – her lyrical specificity, wrenching unexpected emotion from the minutiae of life – for a frustratingly vague refrain: “I’m butterfly, butterfly, butterfly blue,” she coos, lullaby-like, assigning misplaced gravitas to a series of nonsensical words. Instead of artful abstraction, it plays like a series of narcotised 4AM thoughts. It’s a shame that this track and Arm’s Length are placed in succession at the back end of the record, bleeding into one samey mass and closing the album on a strangely banal note. Still, they are anomalous misfires on a body of work that otherwise cements Mallrat as a true genre generalist who could be poised on the precipice of world domination, at least according to the lead single Rockstar. Not if, but “when I’ve won all the Grammys,” she fantasises: a brief, welcome display of braggadocio. We’re inclined to believe her.

5/17/2022,"Do you ever wonder why Australia is spinning its wheels on some of the biggest policy challenges of our time? There are lots of reasons for this, but key among them is the relentless rise of catchphrase politics. Policy complexity gets reduced to a soundbite, often for the sole purpose of wedging political opponents. In communications terms, it’s often cut-through, but it’s a triumph of the short term over the long term. Here are some of the starker examples. Scott Morrison on Sunday used his official campaign launch to announce a policy allowing first-home buyers to access up to $50,000 of retirement savings for a house deposit. This is simple enough to be a cut-through idea. Some young people locked out of the housing market will doubtless be frustrated at being unable to save for a deposit. Given retirement will seem a long way away, they will wonder why they can’t access their own money to fund their most important purchase. Morrison is trying to tap this opportunity cost sentiment as he sprints to election day. He’s gone for this measure in part to provoke an argument with Labor. Morrison’s plan sounds logical, but in truth, this measure is highly problematic. Economists say policies that stimulate demand, like this one, will drive up housing prices even further. That trend benefits property owners, not people trying to get into the market. There’s also an equity issue – why should young people have to raid their retirement savings to buy a house when governments could act to address house price inflation by building more dwellings and overhauling the tax concessions that benefit investors rather than owner-occupiers? Three words that triggered Australia’s destructive, pointless climate wars. This simple slogan is the core of the partisan weaponisation of climate action. The short version of this story is the Gillard government legislated a carbon price during the 43rd parliament. Tony Abbott promptly dubbed the carbon price a tax and built a brutally effective campaign around repealing it with a view to winning the 2013 election. That campaign succeeded in part because Labor, too readily, accepted Abbott’s nomenclature. Years later, Abbott’s chief of staff, Peta Credlin, was candid about their zero-sum political tactics. “It wasn’t a carbon tax, as you know. It was many other things in nomenclature terms but we made it a carbon tax,” Credlin said in February 2017. “We made it a fight about the hip pocket and not about the environment. That was brutal retail politics and it took Abbott about six months to cut through and, when he cut through, Gillard was gone.” Bear in mind carbon pricing is actually the most economically efficient way to drive the transition to low emissions. Bear in mind “axe the tax” has destroyed the possibility of optimal policy. Over time it became clear there was a cost to repealing – rising emissions and a dysfunctional energy market. Malcolm Turnbull tried to pivot out of the damage created by Abbott by creating a new policy mechanism called the national energy guarantee. But that effort blew up the Coalition. It was one of the factors that ended Turnbull’s prime ministership. Morrison had to pick up the pieces during the last parliamentary term. Under pressure from progressive Liberal voters in the cities, as well as key international allies, particularly the US and the UK, Morrison came up with a brand new formulation for Coalition climate policy. Morrison now says the Coalition supports a transition to net zero emissions by 2050 and Australia will meet this target through technology, not taxes. He uses this formulation to contrast the Coalition’s approach with Labor’s. There are a few things to say about this. The first is this is a manufactured fight about nothing. Nobody is proposing to drive the mid-century transition through a carbon tax, and everybody supports technology. Sticking with technology, the government bankrolls investments in technology like soil carbon and green hydrogen with your taxes. So understand: your taxes are bankrolling the Coalition’s technology “not taxes” policy. Another Abbott bequest, although Morrison operationalised this as immigration minister. These three words set the policy architecture and the social licence for Australia’s harsh deterrence policies. Stopping the boats is an article of faith for some Australian voters, even though no one breaks the law when they seek asylum in this country because Australia is a signatory to the refugee convention. While the deterrence framework of boat turnbacks and offshore detention has been successful in stopping the blow of unauthorised boat arrivals to Australia, this elaborate apparatus comes at an enormous cost, both to the budget (around $1bn every year) and to the human beings languishing for years in offshore detention, or in extended limbo in Australia on temporary protection visas. We can keep this one simple. Nobody actually proposed a death tax in 2019. But Liberals characterised Labor’s proposed changes to franking credits – an overhaul that would have delivered $11.4bn in revenue over the forward estimates – as a “retirement tax”. This description was widely used as shorthand in media coverage so a feedback loop developed that amplified the fake news circulating on social media platforms during the 2019 election. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Given the budget is now in deep deficit, any government examining that particular concession looks even more fiscally prudent now than it did back in 2019. But to be clear, Labor did not propose a death or retirement tax in 2019. But a lot of voters believed they were voting Liberal to stop one. The prototype for the 2019 death tax offensive was Labor’s “Mediscare” campaign in 2016. A bit like the death tax, “Mediscare” was grounded in an actual proposal by the Coalition to examine outsourcing the payments system, which was given political potency by Abbott’s deeply unpopular 2014 budget, which contained cuts to health funding and GP copayments. Turnbull acknowledged this point when he talked after the election about Labor having “fertile ground in which that grotesque lie could be sown”. While a whole election was fought around defending Medicare, big problems still remain, not the least of which is hospital funding. With the whole system stretched by the pandemic, the premiers are pushing for the commonwealth to pick up a larger share of the funding. All state and territory leaders have been pushing the federal government to permanently lift the commonwealth’s funding guarantee to a 50-50 funding split beyond June 2023 when the current arrangement ends. The cost to the commonwealth is estimated at about $5bn extra a year. But neither Morrison nor Anthony Albanese is showing much interest in that proposition.",News/Australia news,The rise of catchphrase politics: six examples of how policy loses out to soundbites,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/the-rise-of-catchphrase-politics-six-examples-of-how-policy-loses-out-to-soundbites
5/17/2022,"A new poll has the independent Allegra Spender on track to claim the prize blue-ribbon seat of Wentworth in Sydney’s east, with the Liberal MP Dave Sharma’s primary vote at 36%, down from 47% at the 2019 election. Spender, who is backed by Climate 200 and is running on a platform of action on climate change and integrity in politics, has recorded a 33.3% primary vote and is now enjoying high recognition. But it will be preference flows that determine the final outcome, and Spender has a much more certain flow of preferences. The poll, which asked about preference intentions, shows that Spender is likely to pick up the lion’s share of preferences from Labor, which is has an 11.7% primary vote support, and the Greens, who have 6.2%. Sharma is expected to pick up preferences from the 5.3% of United Australia party voters whose how-to-vote cards put Sharma ahead of Spender. But, surprisingly, only 30% said they would give their preference to Sharma, with 40% unsure who they would preference. Spender would pick up 30% of these preferences. The single-seat poll was conducted by Redbridge Polling on behalf of the Spender campaign in the first week of May and involved automated calls to 1,117 people in the seat. It has a margin of error of 3.7%. The pollsters did not attempt a two-party-preferred calculation, but a look at the 2019 election result reveals the dilemma for Sharma. In 2019 Sharma won 47.4% of the primary vote but only narrowly won the seat with 51.3% two party preferred, with most of the preferences from Labor and Greens eventually ending up with the independent Kerryn Phelps. In the 2018 byelection, won by Phelps, Sharma’s primary vote was 43%. Spender is already ahead of Phelps’ 2019 primary vote (32.43%) and appears to have peeled away a solid bloc of voters who voted Liberal last time. The campaign has been targeting affluent women and young people who are concerned about the environment. There is also now a very low undecided vote in Wentworth of just 4.4%, indicating that most people have made up their minds. There has been much discussion about the accuracy of single-seat polls because of the difficulty of assembling a database of phone numbers within the seat and adjusting for specific demographics. Redbridge said it had polled a mix of mobiles ( 75%) and landlines (25%) between 5.30pm and 8.30pm on weekdays and between 10am and 5.30 on Saturday to ensure it did not oversample non-workers and stay-at-home people. The poll reveals that Wentworth voters are less motivated by issues of economic management and cost of living than other parts of the country. More than 27% nominated climate change and the environment as the most important issue, followed by 22% nominating the economy, 17.4% integrity and trust in politics, and 8.8% cost of living. Among 18 to 39-year olds, cost of living loomed larger as the decisive issue but climate change was still the No 1 issue across all age groups. Among voters over 60, the economy, national security, and health and aged care were more important, with 25% of the age group nominating the economy as most important in deciding their vote. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The issue of trust and integrity in politics, one of Spender’s major campaign themes, appears to have resonated strongly with the 40-59 age group, with 25% nominating this as the most important issue. Scott Morrison has ruled out an integrity commission that can hold public hearings and that would be able to look at corrupt conduct in the past. Sharma and Spender have both been running highly visible campaigns, with many voters displaying their loyalties with yard signs. There has also been a social media blitz by both. Of those surveyed, 60.3% said they were aware of Spender’s campaign, while Sharma enjoys 94% recognition. The Australian’s YouGov Poll, which uses a different methodology, last week found that Sharma would be returned. The MRP (multi-level regression with post-stratification) poll instead aims for a detailed election prediction by surveying an expansive national sample of 18,923 and using demographic modelling to project results for each electorate. It found that Labor would win a majority government with a modest 80 seats, but predicted that Spender would lose Wentworth, with Sharma returned on an increased margin (56%-44%). It also predicted that far from independent “ teal” candidates sweeping away Liberals in seats held by moderates, the only new independent wins would be in Kooyong and Goldstein. The Redbridge polling is at odds with the YouGov Wentworth finding and will become something of a test case of polling methods. Meanwhile, another poll in the Melbourne seat of Higgins – currently held by the Liberal Katie Allen – shows the seat will likely result in a narrow Labor victory. The UComms survey of 836 residents on behalf of the Australia Institute, taken on 2 May using automated voice polling, shows the Liberal’s primary vote at 34.4%, Labor’s at 28.7% and a substantial Greens vote of 18.5%. Nearly 8% said they were undecided. If preferences were allocated based on historical flows, Labor would have a narrow win, 51-49%. But when people were asked how they intended to allocate their preferences, Labor would win 54-46%. The poll also asked some specific questions. Some 92% of Higgins voters support truth in political advertising law, while 52% of Higgins voters oppose new coal and gas projects, with only 31.5% in favour.",News/Australia news,New poll predicts Allegra Spender will win Wentworth from Liberal MP Dave Sharma,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/new-poll-predicts-allegra-spender-will-win-wentworth-from-liberal-mp-dave-sharma
5/17/2022,"The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, has sought to block federal funding for a Gold Coast light rail expansion that would run directly past an investment property she co-owns with her husband. Last week Andrews wrote an open letter to residents of the Gold Coast suburb Palm Beach saying she had requested federal urban infrastructure minister Paul Fletcher oppose any federal funding for the fourth stage of the city’s light rail project – a proposed extension from Burleigh Heads to Coolangatta. The move – on the cusp of a federal election – ended bipartisan support for the three previous stages of the light rail, and prompted an angry response from the long-serving Gold Coast mayor, Tom Tate, who declared: “I have never been this disappointed in the political arena.” Andrews, who is the local MP, said while she still supported the extension to Coolangatta, the route chosen by the state government and the local council, along the Gold Coast highway, was “not tenable”. “I’ve not met one local resident who thinks that reducing the Gold Coast highway to one lane each way to accommodate light rail is a good idea,” she said. Title records obtained by Guardian Australia show Andrews and her husband, Chris, own a unit in a complex on the Gold Coast highway, along the proposed light rail route. Andrews made no mention of the property when announcing her opposition to the light rail extension. However, in her declaration of interests lodged with the federal parliament, Andrews publicly lists her ownership of an investment unit at Palm Beach. Such declarations require an MP to list the suburb or area of a property they own, but not the address. There is no suggestion Andrews has breached any disclosure rules. In her letter to residents, Andrews said she had written to Fletcher to ask “no federal funding be directed to this project as it stands”. In a subsequent interview with the ABC, Andrews said she was “absolutely sympathetic and empathetic to the people of Palm Beach who feel they have not been listened to”. “I will not sit by while their views are steamrolled,” she said. Guardian Australia asked the home affairs minister whether she had mentioned her property interest when she asked Fletcher to place a block on federal funding. In response, Andrews said she would “continue to voice the concerns of Palm Beach residents”. “Last year 81% of 1,376 local McPherson residents surveyed did not support light rail continuing along the highway in its current form,” she said. “All levels of government need to listen to locals and engage in constructive consultation about a considered approach to public transport – whether it’s heavy rail to the airport, electric buses, or any other types.” The Gold Coast light rail project, initially built for the 2018 Commonwealth Games, has been jointly funded by local, state and federal governments. The first two stages have been completed, linking Helensvale and Broadbeach. Work on the third stage extending the line south to Burleigh is about to commence. The final extension, from Burleigh to Coolangatta, is in the planning stages. Some residents of the southern Gold Coast are opposed to the extension, claiming it is unnecessary, would result in high-rise development, and would remove parking along the Gold Coast highway. More than 20,000 people have signed a petition opposing the project. But even opponents were left surprised by Andrews’ letter to residents last week. The founder and president of Save Our Southern Gold Coast, Kath Down, told the Gold Coast Bulletin that she felt Andrews had “definitely backflipped”. Long-term residents and residential property owners have expressed concern that reducing the Gold Coast highway to a single lane in some places would create ongoing traffic problems. Construction works are expected to take several years. A flyover animation showing what the rail project could look like shows the highway cut back to one lane outside the unit complex where Andrews owns her investment property. Guardian Australia spoke to a resident of the apartment complex, who said the highway was already “very congested”, and that traffic often banked up outside the building during peak hour. “If it goes down to one lane then access in here will be a nightmare,” the resident said. The 28-unit complex – which is a mix of owner-occupiers, long-term leaseholders and holiday rentals – has a single driveway entrance that can only be accessed from the highway. The state government and the Gold Coast council say their preferred route is along the highway – three other options were ruled out because they would require property acquisitions to widen residential streets. The Queensland transport minister, Mark Bailey, called on Andrews to state her preferred route prior to the election. “If Ms Andrews chooses any of the three routes through Palm Beach, then hundreds of homes would have to be resumed … and those residents deserve to know if she wants to take their homes now, not after the election,” Bailey said.",News/Australia news,Karen Andrews seeks to block funding for Gold Coast light rail that would run past her property,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/karen-andrews-seeks-to-block-funding-for-gold-coast-light-rail-that-would-run-past-her-property
5/17/2022,"Uber drivers, already feeling rising cost-of-living pains, say there will be a mass industry exodus if base rates don’t increase to sustainable levels. Les Johnson, the secretary of the Ride Share Drivers’ Association of Australia, said fees and charges had “gone through the roof” in recent months resulting in high driver cancellation rates. “Guys are starting to realise if I drive 12km to pick up a job and it’s only a five-minute trip, they’re losing money,” he said. “Everyone is saying fuel is the big cost, it is, but … fees and charges have gone through the roof. Where once you could get into rideshare for $150… now you’re looking closer to $800. “Drivers are stopping driving.” Johnson said since the association formed in 2016, the price of fuel had doubled while there had only been marginal pay increases. On Saturday, a temporary fuel surcharge Uber introduced to combat surging petrol prices lapsed. The measure added about six cents per kilometre for drivers. Last month, Uber made changes to rates based on driver feedback to increase earnings while maintaining an “affordable experience” for riders. Johnson said the impact had been “absolutely minimal”. “Each jurisdiction seems to have a slightly different rate depending on what they can get away with … but in outer metropolitan Brisbane it went up about seven cents per kilometre,” he said. “The rates need to be increased at least 25% to make it viable for drivers, and there has to be more disclosure of the tariff and what the job entails. “Otherwise, the turnover for drivers is going to increase more and more.” Regional areas have been particularly hard hit. Uber base rates are decided based on supply and demand for a particular location, with recommended rates varying across regional and metropolitan markets. The total rate for a trip then factors in estimated time and distance of the route, current demand in the area and tolls, surcharges and fees. A rideshare driver based in the New South Wales Shoalhaven area said driving Uber outside metropolitan regions felt like “slave labour”. The driver, who wished to remain anonymous, said while demand for Ubers may not be as high in the regions as in cities, the service was essential. “Taxis don’t exist in most of these regional areas or you just can’t get one,” he said. “[But] in the past three years as a driver, Uber has only recently increased fares to help in these troubled times. “Uber is so out of touch with regional areas and fares, it’s almost like they don’t care that some drivers really need the job … there’s little work and ridesharing used to be something they made a small profit from. It’s become unprofitable for drivers now.” The driver said Uber was yet to compensate for higher fuel costs and longer commute times in regions. “Fuel prices can be $0.50 a litre higher than in the city … yet Uber’s prices base fare is less. That makes no sense, [and] the driver has no idea where the rider is going to until they actually pick up the rider and start the trip,” he said. He said after Uber takes its 27.5% commission and counting fuel costs, short trips of around five minutes usually left drivers with a regular payment of $5.88. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said long trips came along “once in a while”; however, as drivers were only paid for one way on the trip, he rejected more trips than he accepted. “I can’t afford to go pick up the rider if I have to travel any distance,” he said. “If a rider is more than five minutes away from me, they just don’t get an Uber. That’s sad … regional areas have very limited Ubers in their town, [because] new drivers coming on board quickly learn there is no money to be made. “They disappear as quickly as they came.” Michael Kaine, the national secretary for the Transport Workers Union, said transport workers had been left “in the lurch” and needed the protection of a tribunal to enforce rates. “Fuel costs are surging again, but there’s still no targeted relief … pushing many to the brink,” he said. “Without [a tribunal], workers are forced to bear the brunt of costs outside of their control. It’s not sustainable.” Sandy Nagesh has been driving part-time for Uber for two years. Based in Parramatta, he mainly targets the Sydney CBD and eastern suburbs on weekends when traffic is busiest. He said Uber was “all for themselves”. “When everything else is increasing: expenses, fuel, rent of vehicles, the base fare should increase as well but it’s been the same since I started driving,” he said. “The same time last year I was paying just over a dollar for a litre of petrol and now I’m paying $1.80. “Uber’s still keeping me going but if I were to drive on the weekdays, it wouldn’t be profitable.” Nagesh said to make the service viable, Uber should reduce its commission in line with similar apps like DiDi, which takes 13%, and Ola, which takes 15%. “Uber takes 27.5%,” he said. “It’s a big cut … fair enough, they’re running the company, but that’s about it. “Everything else is on us.” A spokesperson for Uber said the company had been listening to driver feedback that fares needed to be higher. “We considered this … in addition to the impact on the demand for trips from riders, to determine the new recommended fares,” the spokesperson said. “We haven’t made broad ranging changes to pricing for a number of years, and for cities launched more recently, we haven’t revisited pricing since launch of those cities. “These changes have been driven by our desire to deliver the best rideshare platform for driver-partners to earn on and for riders to enjoy a safe, reliable and convenient way to get from A to B.”",News/Australia news,Australian Uber drivers warn of mass exodus if base pay rates remain unsustainably low,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/australian-uber-drivers-warn-of-mass-exodus-if-base-pay-rates-remain-unsustainably-low
5/17/2022,"More than 70% of aged care workers are yet to receive a single payment through the Morrison government’s pandemic bonus scheme four months after it was announced, staff polling suggests. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced in January up to $800 would be made available to aged care workers through a bonus scheme designed to recognise their efforts in the pandemic and stem the loss of workers from the sector. The scheme, which pays out a pro rata bonus in two instalments of up to $400, began taking applications in March. The government asked the underfunded aged care sector to stump up the cash for their workers prior to receiving approval, a design critics say has created a barrier to access. The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation polled nurses and aged care workers to monitor receipt of the bonuses among its members. It found 71% have not received any of the two promised bonuses. About one in five workers have received one payment and only 2.7% have received both. Annie Butler, the federal secretary of the ANMF, said the $800 payment was nowhere near what was needed to address the sector’s critical workforce shortages. She said the fact the government had failed to pay even that inadequate amount to workers was “disgraceful”. “While acknowledging this small offering, unions warned that the payments remained grossly inadequate,” she said. “Now we discover that not only has the Morrison government failed to take real action to fix the crisis in aged care, it hasn’t even delivered on its promised bonus payment for workers. “Our members have had enough of this complete lack of regard from the government. It’s simply disgraceful that during these toughest of times, some of our lowest-paid workers have been abandoned.” The scheme’s design is based on the $393m aged care workforce retention payments made in the early stages of the pandemic. The government insists the scheme is “demand-driven” and reliant on uptake by providers. Earlier this year, the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, said the government was encouraging providers to pay their workers the payment at the time they lodge the application. Other aged care staff unions – including the Health Services Union and the United Workers Union – have criticised that approach. “The for-profits, there’s not many of them, I can see they might dip into their profit margin,” HSU secretary Gerard Hayes told the Guardian in March. “But the not-for-profits, I’ve got no idea where they would get the money to facilitate this. “The reality is this is just a lot of show and not a lot of go.” Aged care has been a policy area hotly contested by both parties during the election. The Coalition has made a string of commitments since the damning aged care royal commission, including its five-year $19.1bn aged care plan, which includes a major boost to home care including 40,000 new home care packages, more funding for respite services, 7,000 new personal care workers and 48,000 new training places. Labor has committed to having registered nurses on site 24/7 at every residential aged care facility and will mandate that every resident receives an average of 215 minutes of care per day, as recommended by the royal commission. It has also pledged to fund and support aged care workers’ case for a 25% pay rise in the Fair Work Commission. The Coalition says it supports the case but has not committed to funding any pay rise. The aged care sector – through its peak body alliance Australian Aged Care Collaboration – has found both major parties have fallen short on fixing the current gaps in workforce availability and Covid-19 prevention funding.

5/17/2022,"Labor is deploying frontbencher Penny Wong to the electorates of Brisbane and Higgins in the final days of the election campaign, as the opposition becomes increasingly bullish about its prospects in the Liberal-held seats due to voter disaffection with Scott Morrison. Strategists say Labor’s internal polling points to opportunity in four Liberal-held seats – Brisbane and Ryan in Queensland, Bennelong in Sydney and Higgins in Victoria – because disapproval of Morrison is high in these electorates and disaffected centrist progressive voters don’t have a teal independent to back. Guardian Australia understands in private YouGov seat polls, 58% of respondents in Ryan, 57% in Bennelong, 62% in Brisbane and 65% in Higgins disapproved of Morrison’s performance as prime minister when asked whether they had a positive or negative view of the Liberal leader. Albanese’s favourability is in the mid-forties in these seats, with voter disapproval numbers in the mid-thirties. The YouGov individual seat surveys, undertaken in February, March, April and as recently as the first week of May, were conducted by phone polling of landlines and mobiles. The sample size for each survey was 400 respondents. Party strategists say the dynamics in the four electorates are similar to the teal contests in Sydney and Melbourne, with local voters riled up about a lack of action on climate change and professional women alienated by Morrison’s response to last year’s #MeToo reckoning in parliament. Wong, who was climate change minister during the Rudd government, has been deployed in the four seats over recent weeks and will redouble on-ground efforts in Brisbane, currently held by Liberal Trevor Evans, and Higgins, currently held by Liberal Katie Allen, as Morrison and Albanese conduct their final dash to the country’s marginal electorates ahead of Saturday’s election. Brisbane and Ryan are three-way contests between Liberal, Labor and the Greens. Labor strategists believe they are a nose in front in the Brisbane contest and contend Ryan – once considered a Liberal stronghold – could fall either to the ALP or the Greens on Saturday night. Labor has been targeting Liberal-held Bennelong given the retirement of John Alexander and a backlash against the Coalition within the Chinese-Australian community. As the campaign enters its final days, Labor is confident about picking up Higgins, which sits between Kooyong and Goldstein, where the contests between the incumbent Liberals and the teal candidates are fierce. Some Victorian strategists believe there is a chance Labor could also snatch Casey from the Liberal column because of the retirement of the former lower house Speaker Tony Smith. Labor holds a notional 69 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives, so needs a net gain of seven seats to form a majority government, and five to be confident of a minority government. The Coalition currently holds 75 seats and will need to offset any losses with gains elsewhere. National opinion polls suggest Labor is the likely winner on Saturday night but published polls were wrong in 2019. Albanese is campaigning in Perth where Labor is targeting three Liberal-held seats and is hopeful of winning two. Morrison began Monday in the Brisbane seat of Blair before visiting Leichhardt in Queensland’s north and then Darwin where the Liberals are targeting Lingiari, currently held by Labor on a 5.5% margin, but up for grabs after the retirement of veteran MP Warren Snowdon. Morrison launched the Liberal campaign on Sunday with a commitment to allow first home buyers to draw on their superannuation savings to fund a house deposit. After economists pointed out the policy would likely lead to further increases in house prices, Morrison moved to play down that prospect. But the superannuation minister, Jane Hume, told ABC radio there would likely be “a bump in house prices” in the short term as “a lot of people bring forward their decision to buy a house”. Labor is opposed to Morrison’s super initiative. Albanese on Tuesday will promise to establish a new $1.5bn medical manufacturing fund out of Labor’s previously announced $15bn national reconstruction fund, and he will address the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday.",News/Australia news,"Labor polling suggests Brisbane, Ryan, Bennelong and Higgins are winnable due to PM’s poor standing",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/labor-polling-suggests-brisbane-ryan-bennelong-and-higgins-are-winnable-due-to-pms-poor-standing
5/17/2022,"Ukraine could receive loans, grants and possibly the proceeds of seized Russian oligarch property to help pay the multibillion-euro cost of rebuilding the country after the ruinous war launched by the Kremlin, according to a leaked EU reconstruction plan. In the plan drafted in Brussels, the European Commission states that the Ukrainian government will have to take out loans to pay for rebuilding its war-ravaged country. Non-repayable grants from EU member states would provide another tranche of the funds needed to rebuild destroyed homes, schools, roads, railways, airports and bridges. The EU also proposes assessing the feasibility of using assets seized from sanctioned Russians and Belarusians after a proposal from the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, earlier this month. “I am absolutely convinced that this is extremely important not only to freeze assets, but also to make possible to confiscate it, to make it available for the rebuilding of the country,” he told Ukraine’s Interfax news agency. Lawmakers in the UK and the US have also proposed seizing Russian property to aid Ukraine’s reconstruction and ease the plight of the country’s refugees. Brussels officials have also called for the EU to borrow as a bloc on international capital markets to finance loans for Kyiv, according to the leaked report. If agreed, it would be only the second time in its history that the EU has borrowed as a whole rather than as individual member states, after funding the landmark €750bn (£635bn) Covid recovery plan in 2020. The idea is floated in a Ukraine relief and reconstruction plan seen by the Guardian that the commission is expected to publish on Wednesday. Figures have been left blank in the document, pending further discussions in Brussels. The paper notes, however, that the financial needs “are expected to be substantial” and that reconstruction would take more than a decade. It also estimates that damage to physical infrastructure alone may run to more than €100bn. To pay the bill, the commission proposes a mix of grants and cheap loans in which EU member states and non-EU countries could make contributions via the bloc’s reconstruction programme. Ukraine will need “significant short-term financial relief” to sustain basic services, provide humanitarian aid and fix essential infrastructure, the EU document states. To meet these urgent needs, the commission proposes loans at low interest rates with long-term repayment deadlines. The US president, Joe Biden, proposed a $33bn (£27bn) aid programme for Ukraine last month, which includes more than $20bn in military spending. The EU has provided €4.1bn in emergency loans and humanitarian aid since the start of Russia’s invasion and agreed to fund weapons and other non-lethal military assistance worth €1.5bn. This does not include the money that individual EU member states have provided. The EU’s reconstruction plan would be jointly led by Brussels and Kyiv, according to the document. Although it does not explicitly mention Ukraine’s hopes of joining the EU, the plan would be intended to bring the aspirant member in line with EU standards, including on the rule of law, anti-corruption, energy and the climate.",News/World news,Revealed: EU plans loans and grants to help rebuild Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/revealed-eu-plans-loans-and-grants-to-help-rebuild-ukraine
5/17/2022,"Standing atop the damaged roof of his house on the main road north from Kharkiv going to villages occupied by Russian forces until a few days ago, Konstantin Kharlamov, 53, had just two hours earlier watched black smoke billow in the distance. His friend Vitaliy, 41, the smell of heavy liquor on his breath, said he also saw the explosion, perhaps just two miles away up Lesya Serdyuka Street in the direction of his home village, Strilecha. The departure of the Russians had three days ago given him the chance to move to a safer district of Kharkiv after two and a half months living under occupation. But he was now cut off because of renewed fighting. The constant background thuds and irregular thunder cracks that filled the air and the jumpy Ukrainian soldiers at the checkpoints amid the burnt-out trees, cars and scattered military detritus offered support to the two men’s testimony of unfinished business in Ukraine’s second city. Four people were said to have been wounded in strikes around the Shevchenkivskyi region of Kharkiv on Monday and one person was confirmed to have been killed in the liberated northern village of Tsyrkuny. Vladimir Putin’s forces are being pushed back, and it may prove to be the case that the Battle of Kharkiv joins the Battle of Kyiv in being a triumphant victory for Ukraine. The US Institute for the Study of War on Friday described it as effectively over and Ukrainian soldiers posted a video on Sunday night of them erecting a new border post at the nearby Russian border as an indication of their growing strength and confidence. “Mr President, we made it!”, they wrote in a Facebook post. But there is also ample evidence in Kharkiv’s suburbs that the Russians intend to fight hard to keep some offensive positions around this north-eastern Ukrainian stronghold; their forces remain sufficiently close to pepper the outskirts of the city with artillery fire. The Ukrainian military urged calm when a fertiliser plant was hit on Monday, bellowing out red fumes, which the authorities said were not dangerous to health. Officials from Ukraine’s general staff said on Monday that the Russians were focused on “maintaining positions and preventing the advance of our troops toward the border”. If it is a withdrawal by Russia, it is a fighting one, as the people who have suffered so mightily in Kharkiv are well aware. Vitaliy pointed to the rocket-shaped hole in three walls inside his friend’s shattered two-storey home and simply asked, with tears in his eyes: “When will it all end?” “Only when Putin is dead,” responded Kharlamov, who moved back into his home three days ago with his wife, Olga, 48. They sleep downstairs amid dust and broken glass. They had been on the roof trying to rainproof it as the weather turned. “The rocket hit on the 50th day of war, but we had left by then because it was so horrific here,” he said. “I went to the supermarket one day and a rocket destroyed a house right in front of me. It was hell.” Their home is still without heat, electricity or running water. “We came back to try to save the rooms from the rain,” Kharlamov said. “Just look what they have done to us.”",News/World news,‘When will it all end?’: Kharkiv counts the cost as Russians pull back,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/when-will-it-all-end-kharkiv-counts-the-cost-as-russians-pull-back
5/17/2022,"A taskforce of Australian government agencies and social media companies set up to counter violent extremism online in the wake of the Christchurch terror attack has been quietly disbanded. The revelation that the taskforce was wound up last year comes in the wake of the Buffalo shooting in the United States, as the government faces fresh criticism about its response to the 2019 terror attack by an Australian man. The white 18-year-old male charged with the murders of 10 people at a convenience store in Buffalo, New York on Saturday cited the Great Replacement Theory and the manifesto of the Christchurch shooter in his own manifesto. In response to the Christchurch attack, the government convened a taskforce made up of government bodies, internet service providers and social media platforms to help tackle online extremism from far right and white supremacy groups in Australia. They made recommendations to government in June 2019, including to work to proactively remove terrorism and violent material online, and routinely report back to government on how different aspects of implementing the report were being achieved. But since then, the taskforce has met just three times, with the last meeting in May 2021, when the taskforce was disbanded and responsibility shifted to the eSafety commissioner and Department of Home Affairs. The department said in February that a March 2021 review of the actions taken since the report had found the response to be “adequate” overall. A spokesperson for the department told Guardian Australia content was still referred to social media platforms for removal, and between 1 January 2020 and 15 March 2022, there were 5,930 items of terrorist and violent extremist content referred for removal, 4,271 of which were removed. Australia is a member of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) and through this, a content incident protocol was activated to limit the spread of the online material associated with the Buffalo attack, the spokesperson said. When asked specifically what the government was doing to counter the Great Replacement Theory narrative, Home Affairs responded that it had undertaken “broad-based programs of work to promote Australia’s national identity, liberal democratic values and social cohesion.” The example provided was a podcast/videocast launched in September 2021 called Fearlessly Australian. It is hosted by boxer Danny Green, who interviews other Australians including Robert Irwin, NRL legend Nathan Hindmarsh, an ADF officer and a UFC star. The department said the series was “designed to engage young Australian men who may be vulnerable to ideologically motivated violent extremist narratives”. “Fearlessly Australian supports a cohesive community by hosting positive role models who deliver content that is frank and informative and encourages resilience, critical thinking, and practical insights into dealing with uncertainty, change or adversity,” the department said. The accompanying Facebook page currently has 338 followers. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Greens anti-racism spokesperson, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, said it “chills me to my core” that the Australian Christchurch attacker has inspired other mass killings. “But what is even more unsettling is that since Christchurch, there has been virtually no self-reflection – let alone action – on the part of Australian politicians, that one of our own not only committed the atrocities of March 2019, but has inspired a wave of copycat extremists,” she said. “The Morrison government, by all accounts, has tried to wash its hands of Christchurch and neutralise any attempts to understand what is driving the rise in far-right extremism, including what in our politics and culture might be leading young white men down a violent, racist path.” Guardian Australia sought comment from the Coalition. An inquiry established in December 2020 by the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security inquiry examined extremist movements and radicalism in Australia. It was established after Labor had pushed for an inquiry specifically focused on far-right extremism. The then home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, watered down the terms of reference to cover religiously motivated and ideologically motivated extremism, with references to the far right omitted. Faruqi said the language shift showed the government’s approach to the far right. “It is a government that oversaw a shift in the language used by authorities to describe far-right extremism, reframing it instead as the banal-sounding ‘ideologically motivated violent extremism’. This has already demonstrably impacted how far-right racism is spoken about, both by government figures and in media reporting.” Ultimately, the inquiry held just two public hearings and never delivered a final report to parliament, with chair James Paterson stating the committee’s other “pressing demands” had meant the report could not be finished. Paterson recommended the next parliament finish the inquiry. Labor has also not responded to a request for comment. In additional comments made to the Social Media and Online Safety inquiry report, Labor members Tim Watts and Sharon Claydon recommended Home Affairs evaluate how it notifies social media providers about terrorist and violent and extremist content on platforms, noting Meta had told the committee it had not received any intelligence on that from Home Affairs. They also called for Australia’s online safety laws to be refined so action could be taken against online hate speech targeted at specific groups. “Right-wing extremism is a growing concern for Australian security agencies; we need to address online hate speech,” they said.",News/Australia news,Australia quietly shuts down anti-terror taskforce set up after Christchurch attack,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/australia-quietly-shuts-down-anti-terror-taskforce-set-up-after-christchurch-attack
