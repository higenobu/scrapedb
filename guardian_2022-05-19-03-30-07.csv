5/19/2022,"Academics and student leaders have told MPs of their frustration at the denial of and the lack of practical action to tackle the “ingrained institutional racism” experienced by black students and staff on university campuses. Nicola Rollock, a professor of social policy and race at King’s College London, said examples of racism within academia had been “trivialised beyond belief” by the media despite leading some of its victims to consider suicide. Rollock said: “We are not talking about a single, one-off, isolated incident but women and other colleagues across the sector have been subjected to, and continue to be subjected to, sets of systematic behaviours that undermine and exclude colleagues of colour over a period of time. “In other contexts that would be described as bullying. In other contexts it would described as abuse. But because the topic is one of racism it is relegated to the sidelines.” Rollock, an expert on the careers of black female professors, told MPs on the women and equalities committee of cases involving black academics’ treatment at the hands of their employers “that were so upsetting and so traumatic and so shocking that it led them to consider taking their own life”. She added: “So I want to be absolutely clear, when we are talking about everyday racism, we are not talking about the odd raising of an eyebrow or the odd slight. We are talking about systematic, ongoing undermining and patronising behaviour that comes under the banner of everyday racism.” Rollock’s comments were supported by David Richardson, the vice-chancellor of the University of East Anglia, who said it was clear that “ingrained institutional racism” was behind the differences in top grades awarded to white and black students. “My view is that we need to move on from that debate and actually progress with dismantling that institutional racism,” Richardson said. “It’s been 15 years or longer that there’s been a 20% degree-awarding gap at institutions, and in that time that awarding gap has not diminished. “I think we just have not taken the time to address these covert issues that are impacting students from black, Asian and minority backgrounds and leading to those degree awarding gaps.” Rollock said: “If we are to move forward in a meaningful way – and some colleagues may see this as controversial but I see it as necessary – then we will have to consider the levers that are going to actually encourage, or perhaps force, change. And we are not just dependent on goodwill, more reports or individual commitments.” The committee also questioned Larissa Kennedy, the national president of the National Union of Students (NUS), over the accusations of antisemitism that have dogged the organisation. Kennedy said the NUS had acted “incredibly swiftly” on complaints of antisemitism including those from the Union of Jewish Students. “We are looking forward to this inquiry and have opened ourselves up even more than was asked … because we believe that any change that we need to see has to be a commitment to real transformative change that reckons with the structural issues here,” Kennedy said. “As national president I do deeply regret that we are at this point but I also really welcome that we are able to kick off this work that is truly about transformative change.”",News/Education,"Black students frustrated at lack of action on university racism, MPs told",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/18/black-students-frustrated-lack-action-university-racism-mps-told
5/19/2022,"As a Conservative MP arrested on suspicion of rape is released on bail, we take a look at sexual misconduct allegations made against MPs and their outcomes. The Conservative MP for Wakefield, Imran Ahmad Khan, was found guilty in April of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy after plying him with gin at a party in 2008. Khan assaulted the boy in Staffordshire in January 2008, 11 years before he became an MP. He resigned as an MP two weeks after he was found guilty. The Conservative MP for Tiverton and Honiton in April admitted to watching porn on his phone in the House of Commons. Parish initially suggested he had opened the porn “in error” but subsequently admitted that while the first time he had watched porn in parliament was an accident, and he was in fact searching for tractors, the second occasion was deliberate. He announced his decision to resign as an MP. The Conservative party removed the whip from the MP for Somerton and Frome, who, the Sunday Times reported, is facing allegations from three women. Warburton, 56, was accused by one of the women of climbing into bed with her naked. She told the Sunday Times she repeatedly warned that she did not want to have sex with him, but alleged that he ground his body against her and groped her breasts. He is said to have denied any wrongdoing, and insisted he had “enormous amounts of defence, but unfortunately the way things work means that doesn’t come out first”. The Conservative MP for Delyn was allowed to rejoin the party despite an independent investigation finding that he sexually harassed a junior member of staff. Roberts was suspended for 12 weeks after the independent panel found he had made “significant” repeated and unwanted sexual advances towards a former member of staff and used “his position as his employer to place him under pressure to accede”. He had his membership to the party restored but continued to sit as an independent MP in parliament. In December 2021, in family proceedings a high court judge concluded that the former Conservative minister raped his wife when she was asleep and subjected her to coercive control. The judgment detailed alleged domestic abuse by Griffiths towards his wife, Kate, who is a serving Conservative MP, during their marriage. It also included pressing her into sex, physically assaulting and verbally abusing her, the judge found. Andrew Griffiths denied allegations and “adamantly denied” rape. He resigned from government as business minister in July 2018 after sending 2,000 sexually explicit messages to constituents. In November 2019 he stepped down as an MP. The MP for Dover was convicted and jailed in 2020 for sexually assaulting two women. He was found guilty of three charges, two in relation to a parliamentary worker in 2016 and one in relation to a woman at his family’s central London home in 2007. The sentencing judge described Elphicke as “a sexual predator who used … success and respectability as a cover”. During the trial, jurors heard that his first victim had suffered a “terrifying episode” when he assaulted her, then chased her round his home chanting “I’m a naughty Tory”. In July 2021, an employment tribunal ruled that the Labour MP for Hartlepool repeatedly sexually assaulted and harassed a parliamentary staff member before victimising her when she refused his advances. A central London employment tribunal found he marginalised her in parliament, changed her terms and conditions of employment and made her redundant when the staff member, known as Ms A, rejected his advances and declarations of love. Hill had resigned as a Labour MP in March 2021, resulting in a May byelection in Hartlepool and a victory for the Conservatives. In April 2018, the Labour MP for Barrow and Furness was suspended from the Labour party amid an investigation into claims he sent inappropriate text messages to a female former aide. Later that year, he quit the Labour party, saying in a resignation letter that the disciplinary case was politically motivated and rigged against him. He vehemently denied the allegations. His resignation meant the investigation was not concluded. He continued to serve as an independent and later joined the House of Lords as a crossbench life peer. Conservative Michael Fallon resigned as defence secretary in 2017, admitting that his behaviour towards women in the past had “fallen short”. Fallon apologised for making unwanted advances to the journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer, repeatedly placing his hand on her knee – although Hartley-Brewer herself insisted: “No one was remotely upset or distressed.” However, after his resignation, additional allegations were made against him. In September 2019, he announced he would not seek re-election at the 2019 general election. The Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire was referred to the party’s complaints procedure in 2017 after admitting he sent “sexual chatter” to a 19-year-old woman who hoped to work for him. He resigned as pensions secretary in 2016 after allegations that he had sent suggestive messages on WhatsApp to a woman in her 20s, whom he had met through his political role. Crabb apologised for the messages and a Conservative party investigating panel determined that his behaviour had been inappropriate, but did not constitute harassment. He remains an MP. The junior trade minister Mark Garnier was formally cleared of wrongdoing in 2017 for asking his former assistant to buy a sex toy and calling her “sugar tits”. Garnier did not deny the accusations about the events in 2010 made by his former assistant Caroline Edmondson, which prompted a one-month investigation by the Cabinet Office to see if he had breached the ministerial code. Damian Green was sacked as first secretary of state in 2017 after admitting he lied about the presence of pornographic images on his House of Commons computer. In his resignation letter, the Conservative MP for Ashford continued to maintain he did not “download or view” the pornography, but added that he “should have been clear in my press statements”. A Cabinet Office inquiry was unable to reach a definitive conclusion on separate allegations, made by the Tory activist Kate Maltby, that Green had behaved improperly towards her. Green continued to maintain he did not believe he did anything inappropriate. The Labour MP for Luton North left the party in January 2021 before an inquiry into sexual harassment allegations against him was concluded, meaning no findings were drawn. Hopkins was accused in 2017 of inappropriate physical contact and was suspended by the Labour party pending an investigation. He continued to sit as an independent until the general election last year, when he opted to stand down from the House of Commons after a 22-year career. The prominent Eurosceptic cited his wife’s health as the reason for standing down and has denied the allegations against him. In 2017, Clive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich South and former shadow business secretary, was cleared of allegations of sexual harassment after a party investigation. Lewis, the MP for Norwich South, was accused of grabbing a female Labour member’s bottom at a fringe event at the party’s conference in September.",News/UK news,List of sexual misconduct allegations made against MPs ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/list-of-sexual-misconduct-allegations-made-against-mps
5/19/2022,"With the benefit of hindsight, one can say that the stock market got wildly overexcited a year ago about the recovery prospects of consumer-facing companies. When the restrictions came off, went the thinking, punters would enjoy themselves and lockdown’s corporate losers would be transformed into winners. As happens often, an essentially sound idea was overdone. Shares in Mitchells & Butlers, the UK’s biggest pubs group, rallied from 120p in autumn 2020 all the way to 325p in spring 2021 in anticipation of good times ahead. Since then, they have fallen back to 211p. Rival Marston’s has followed a similar trajectory: from 40p to 100p and now back to 58p. Jim Chanos, the famed short-seller, was right when, at the height of last year’s bullishness, he diagnosed too much wishful thinking on the part of investors. “The worst thing that can happen to reopening stocks is that we reopen,” he said cutely. Real life is hard, especially when reopening is followed by soaring energy costs, higher food prices, wage inflation and a brutal cost-of-living squeeze. There is, though, a fair argument that investors, having overdosed on optimism, are now underestimating the ability of the likes of M&B and Marston’s – both well-run companies – to adapt to tough trading conditions. Both companies in their half-year reports on Wednesday flagged cost pressures as “a significant challenge for the industry”, as the M&B chief executive, Phil Urban, put it. His group puts cost inflation at 11.5% this year versus 2019 levels, and is assuming 6% for the next year. But both firms also seemed encouraged by current consumer behaviour. “Trading remains stable and we look forward to an uninterrupted summer,” said Marston’s boss, Andrew Andrea. It may just be the calm before the storm and there are limits to how far menus can be tweaked to mitigate the effects of food inflation. Meanwhile, energy prices – a huge variable in cost bases – can always get worse. Yet it is probably also true that pub companies, when their balance sheets are sound, remain defensive assets with “proven resilience in previous times of economic challenge”, as Andrea argued. The sight of inflation at 9% already doesn’t help, but it’s also possible that much of the current uncertainty is already priced in. Not for the first time in the great Elon Musk/Twitter saga, one can observe that life would be simpler if the scrap were conducted under UK takeover rules. At the outset, we would have been spared the Twitter board’s flirtation with a “poison pill” defence, a mechanism that would be deemed a “frustrating action” under the UK code and ruled offside. It is also safe to assume that Musk would now be told not to be silly if he tried to argue that a “material adverse change” has taken place because Twitter can’t offer cast-iron proof of the number of fake accounts on its platform. Back in 2001, WPP tried to escape its offer for advertising group Tempus on the grounds that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were a material change. It was ordered by the Takeover Panel to go ahead anyway, the thinking being that the value of Tempus could be recovered over time. Similarly, the consortium bidders for Moss Bros were not allowed to pull their offer when the Covid pandemic arrived in 2020. The point is that the bar for a material change should be set high, otherwise chancers will try their luck. A bit of bother about bots shouldn’t get remotely near the threshold. Musk’s approach is shabby, as argued here yesterday. The American system is more legalistic and its regulators seem all over the place, and so it falls to Twitter’s board to try to force through the deal on the agreed terms. The fact that there’s even a debate, however, is absurd – at least to UK eyes. Under a sensible set-up, Musk would know he’s on the hook with no prospect of wriggling off. Amanda Blanc, chief executive of Aviva, the target of shockingly sexist remarks at the insurer’s annual meeting last week, fairly wonders if the incident will provoke a rethink on how boards interact with shareholders in future. One hopes it does. Turn off the offenders’ microphone at the earliest moment, tell them to leave the meeting and ban them from next year’s event. Owning a share does not bestow a right to be offensive.",News/Business,Pub companies were lockdown losers but can adapt to tough trading conditions,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/may/18/pub-companies-were-lockdown-losers-but-can-adapt-to-tough-trading-conditions
5/19/2022,"Salvation for golf’s purists, irked by the Saudi Arabian themes dominating their sport, may arrive in the form of a 28-year-old from Dallas. Should Jordan Spieth lift the Wanamaker Trophy on Sunday evening, a career grand slam complete, there will be an appealing narrative to at least momentarily offset incessant chatter about breakaway tours, human rights and golf’s persona non grata, Phil The Shill. Spieth arrived at Southern Hills in the kind of form that suggests this is his finest chance yet to add the US PGA Championship to the Masters, US Open and Open. He would become only the sixth man in history to win each of golf’s big four. It is to Spieth’s credit that he fully embraces another tilt at history-making. “Certainly at this point, having won the other three, it’s an elephant in the room for me,” Spieth said. “It’s a goal of mine. If you just told me I was going to win one tournament the rest of my life, I’d say I want to win this one, given where things are at. If you told me that before my career started I was going to win one tournament ever, I’d say the Masters because that was my favourite tournament growing up. “Things change, and this obviously has significant meaning. Long term, it would be really cool to say that you captured the four biggest golf tournaments in the world that are played in different parts of the world and different styles, too. So you feel like you kind of accomplished golf when you win a career grand slam. “I have come close a couple times. This hasn’t necessarily been my most successful major but I feel good heading into this week.” Spieth has won the RBC Heritage and finished second at the Byron Nelson since a surprise missed cut at the Masters. Augusta National proved a head-scratcher for the man himself. “Friday’s round, I shot 76 and I can’t tell you that I missed a shot,” he said. “It was bizarre. I just really didn’t feel like I did much wrong. I’ve had weeks like that before. You just hope that they’re not at the Masters.” By his own admission, the old Spieth would have sought technical change after playing just 36 holes in Georgia. His slump after winning the 2017 Open renders a subsequent return to the summit of golf all the more admirable. Spieth is back inside the world’s top 10, having been 92nd in early 2021. Spieth, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy leap out as the tournament’s marquee grouping for the first two rounds here. The trio have just the 22 majors between them. “They’re both just great to play with,” said Spieth. “They’re quick. They’re positive. I think you’ve got to embrace it and have fun and recognise these are the kind of pairings I’ll get to tell my kid about some day: ‘I got to play with Tiger in a major.’ Last year, you weren’t sure if that was ever going to happen again. I know it’s great for golf, but selfishly it’s pretty exciting to be able to play these events growing up with the guy that you idolised.” McIlroy’s form and mood look positive as he pursues a first major triumph since 2014. Jon Rahm’s touch around the greens should be a huge Southern Hills advantage. Shane Lowry has said he is “quietly confident” about his prospects of victory. Only 98 days sit between the final round of the Phoenix Open and the same point in this US PGA. If Scottie Scheffler prevails in Tulsa, he will have won five times in that window. “When I show up to tournaments, I don’t feel any different,” insisted the Masters champion. Searing temperatures, brisk winds and crossover holes mean pace of play will inevitably be an issue. It would be no shock, in fact, if the second round rumbles into early on Saturday even without weather delays. Southern Hills offers a stern physical test. As if to prove thoughts of Saudi are never far away, Richard Bland delivered a blunt response when asked whether he had second thoughts over competing in their $25m event in Hertfordshire next month. The European Tour will not grant permission for members such as Bland to feature. “I am going to play,” said Bland. “If I get banned, I get banned. Most of my career is behind me now as regards playing at the very highest level. I’m 50 years old in six months. “I’m a realist. Mother Nature does tend to catch up on you. I have an opportunity to play these events and secure my future and I’d be pretty foolish to turn that down.” Thankfully the likes of Spieth value professional legacy over cheques.",Sport/Sport,Jordan Spieth confident as he eyes chance at US PGA for career grand slam | Ewan Murray,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/18/jordan-spieth-confident-chance-career-grand-slam-us-pga-championship
5/19/2022,"Ministers have rejected a key recommendation from the Grenfell Tower public inquiry that all disabled tenants should be given a personal evacuation plan in the event of a fire, sparking anger from survivors and disability campaigners. Fifteen of the 37 disabled residents perished in the 2017 fire and Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the chairman of the inquiry, recommended in October 2019 that the “owner and manager of every high-rise residential building be required by law to prepare personal emergency evacuation plans [Peeps] for all residents whose ability to self-evacuate may be compromised (such as persons with reduced mobility or cognition)”. But the Home Office said it has decided it is not proportionate or practical to introduce the plan, citing problems such as the costs to landlords. It said good relations between disabled and non-disabled residents could be put at risk if the latter had to shoulder costs associated with the evacuation plans such as buying evacuation chairs, or modifying buildings. “The evidence base for Peeps is not sufficient to mandate their implementation in high-rise residential buildings at this stage,” it said, as it announced a new consultation on alternative proposals. In 2019 Boris Johnson told parliament: “Where Sir Martin recommends responsibility for fire safety to be taken on by central government, we will legislate accordingly.” Robert Jenrick, then the communities secretary, added: “As the prime minister said in his opening remarks, the government will accept all of the findings of the report and accept them in full.” Disability Rights UK said the government’s decision was “utterly reprehensible and shows that it does not consider our lives to have equal value with non-disabled people”. Fazilet Hadi, Disability Rights UK’s head of policy, said: “The recommendation that Peeps be put in place was made by the Grenfell Tower inquiry in October 2019, following evidence from fire safety experts. Almost 40% of the disabled residents living in the tower died in the fire, and it is highly likely that their lives could have been saved had Peeps been in place … the government’s decision is a dereliction of its duties under the law, and fails to uphold our human rights.” Grenfell United, which represents bereaved people and survivors, said the decision “has left us speechless. Outraged.” It said the Grenfell inquiry “concluded that the government must drop its reliance on stay put and provide personal evacuation plans for disabled residents”. “Today – three years on – the government has announced it will not implement this core recommendation,” it said in a statement. “They have decided that cutting costs is more important than the value of human life. We will not let this be brushed under the carpet.” The alternative being considered by ministers involves sharing the location of disabled residents with fire services. This would probably be limited to residential blocks with an evacuation, rather than a stay put, strategy in place – typically buildings considered more at fire risk. In these buildings, landlords would be required to ask residents to make themselves known if they feel they might need support to evacuate in the event of a fire. The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said it would be “completely unacceptable to have a situation where high-risk buildings in which residents who can do so are told to evacuate immediately if there is a fire, but disabled residents are left inside in the hope of rescue by the fire service”. “There needs to be an obligation on landlords to take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of disabled residents,” said Cllr Ian Stephens, the chair of the LGA fire services management committee.",News/UK news,Outrage as ministers reject post-Grenfell safety plans for disabled people,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/outrage-as-ministers-reject-post-grenfell-safety-plans-for-disabled-people
5/19/2022,"Kenneth Branagh’s depiction of Boris Johnson has been revealed in a clip from the upcoming drama series This England, which follows the prime minister’s tumultuous first months in Downing Street as he grapples with the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The series, formerly known as This Sceptred Isle, is co-written and directed by Michael Winterbottom and is due to air on Sky Atlantic later this year. “The drama takes us inside the halls of power as Johnson (Branagh) grapples with Covid-19, Brexit, and a controversial personal and political life,” Sky said. “The events in government are interwoven with stories from around the UK, from the experts and scientists racing against time to understand the virus; the doctors, nurses and care-home workers on the frontline working tirelessly and heroically to contain and overcome it; and ordinary people whose lives were thrown into turmoil.” The teaser, released on Wednesday, opens with a jubilant voiceover by Branagh, 61, as the prime minister, saying: “A new dawn is breaking, 2020 will be a year of prosperity.” #ThisEngland, based on Boris Johnson’s tumultuous first months as UK Prime Minister starring BAFTA and Academy Award-winner Kenneth Branagh. #UnmissableSky pic.twitter.com/h6rNkyvcjd The tone of the video shifts as Johnson’s concern for the pandemic appears to grow. “This Covid virus we need to keep an eye on,” he says. A montage of clips of No 10 follows as the pandemic escalates, with the voiceover: “500,000 deaths, that is a worst-case scenario”. An eerie soundtrack plays as the familiar rhetoric to “wash your hands” and “stay at home” plays alongside images of the prime minister hosting press conferences at Downing Street. The pressure on the prime minister appears to mount as Branagh’s Johnson says: “Isn’t it someone’s actual job to give me a heads-up?” The teaser closes with an image of the door of No 10 shutting and a radio announcer saying: “The United Kingdom has overtaken Italy to report the highest official death toll.” Ophelia Lovibond, known for her roles in the BBC sitcom W1A and the film Guardians of the Galaxy, will portray Carrie Symonds, who was to become the prime minister’s wife. Symonds gave birth to the couple’s first child in April 2020, shortly after Johnson was admitted to an intensive care unit with Covid. The Broadchurch star Andrew Buchan will portray the former health secretary Matt Hancock, who later resigned from his post after video was leaked showing him kissing his aide Gina Coladangelo in his ministerial office – in breach of his own Covid rules. The series will trace the impact of the pandemic on Britain and the response of scientists, nurses and doctors. It is based on first-hand evidence from people inside Downing Street, the Department of Health, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies , and from hospitals and care homes.

5/19/2022,"Republican candidates who questioned, denied and challenged the results of the 2020 presidential election won a string of consequential primaries in Pennsylvania and North Carolina this week, a testament to the enduring power of Donald Trump’s voter fraud myth, which continues to animate the hard-right movement he started. In a campaign season dominated by angst over the economy and frustration with leadership in Washington, several hard-right candidates successfully channeled conservative grassroots momentum, and are now in striking distance of positions that will have enormous influence over voting and elections administration in battleground states across the country. Democrats, meanwhile, who face a grim electoral outlook dampened by Joe Biden’s dismal approval ratings, chose to elevate candidates who more closely reflected the party’s base, with progressives on the verge of growing their ranks in Congress. Though not yet complete, the results from Tuesday’s highly anticipated election night delivered a composite portrait of a Republican party still in Trump’s thrall, even in races where his chosen candidate came up short. In Pennsylvania, Republicans nominated Doug Mastriano, a hard-right election denier who was a key figure in the efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in his state. He attended and helped organize Trump’s “Save America” rally in Washington on January 6 that preceded the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol, and has been subpoenaed by the House panel investigating the assault. Mastriano’s victory sets up a high-stakes showdown with Josh Shapiro, the state’s Democratic attorney general. Should Mastriano prevail in November, he would be in charge of one of the most contested states in the country – one in which the governor appoints the secretary of state, who in turn oversees the election. During his campaign, Mastriano embraced elements of Christian nationalism, staking out controversial positions on issues such as abortion, LGBTQ rights and public health mandates. In one debate, he suggested he would oppose any exceptions to an abortion ban, including in cases involving rape or incest. Shapiro has cast himself as a defender of abortion rights, an issue that is expected to play a key role in governor’s races this fall should the supreme court strike down Roe v Wade, as is anticipated. In his victory speech Tuesday night, Mastriano lashed out at media outlets and commentators who referred to him as “extreme”. “They like to call people who stand on the constitution far-right and extreme,” he said. “Forcing your kids to mask up, that’s extreme. Forcing healthcare workers to lose their job for not getting a jab. It’s extreme when you shut down businesses in our state.” In the marquee Senate race, the Trump-backed celebrity physician, Mehmet Oz, was neck-and-neck with the former hedge fund chief executive David McCormick, with nearly all of the vote tallied. The conservative commentator Kathy Barnette had fallen far behind and was out of contention for the nomination. During the campaign, the candidates competed to claim the Maga mantle. Both Oz, who touted Trump’s endorsement, and McCormick, who is married to the former Trump administration official Dina Powell, struggled to animate the former president’s loyal base, and spent millions of dollars of their personal war chests attacking each other in one of the most expensive intra-party brawls of the cycle. That apparently left an opening for Barnette, who enjoyed a last-minute surge in the polls. Despite her Maga bona fides and endorsements from Trump’s allies, the former president warned voters that she was unelectable. In response to doubts about the strength of her candidacy, Barnette said: “Maga does not belong to President Trump.” In North Carolina, the scandal-plagued first-term congressman Madison Cawthorn lost his re-election bid despite Trump urging supporters to give the 26-year-old Maga firebrand a “second chance”. He was beaten by Chuck Edwards, a state senator who offered a record that was every bit as conservative but without the celebrity. It was a sharp fall for Cawthorn, once viewed as a rising star in the Maga universe, and a rare win for the Republican party’s old guard, which aligned against him. Trump’s choice for Senate, the North Carolina congressman Tedd Budd, also triumphed. Trump’s early endorsement of the little-known House Republican reshaped the race, elevating a candidate who objected to the certification of 2020 election results in two states. He beat out the state’s former governor, Pat McCrory, who refused to say the 2020 election was stolen. Budd now faces the former state supreme court chief justice Cheri Beasley for the seat being vacated by the retiring Republican senator Richard Burr. If elected, Beasley would be the southern state’s first Black senator if elected. Trump’s choice in Idaho also came up short, failing to unseat the state’s Republican governor, Brad Little. Janice McGeachin, the state’s far-right lieutenant governor, who twice attempted a power grab while Little was out of state, had made Trump’s false claims of a stolen election a central plank of her candidacy. While much of the focus was on Trump’s influence over his party, Tuesday’s results tested Biden’s appeal among the party’s base. In Oregon, a progressive challenger, Jamie McLeod-Skinner, appeared on track to unseat the congressman Kurt Schrader, a seven-term incumbent with a reputation for breaking with his party. Schrader was the first candidate Biden endorsed this cycle, and his loss would be a major victory for the progressive movement. In Pennsylvania, Congressman Conor Lamb, an avowed centrist from the Biden wing of the party who won difficult races in Trump country, lost handily to the state’s lieutenant governor, John Fetterman, an iconoclastic progressive with blue-collar appeal. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania state representative Summer Lee, running for an open House seat, appeared to have overcome a wave of money from outside groups aiming to counter the progressive movement. If she wins the primary in the solidly Democratic district, Lee would be on track to become the first Black woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress. “Our victory shows that we can overcome the billionaire class that wants to divide and conquer us all with fear and lies-for-profit, if only we come together across our differences for a positive vision of multiracial democracy,” Lee wrote on Twitter after declaring victory on Tuesday night. “We can have nice things, if we fight.”",News/US news,Republican ‘big lie’ supporters triumph in sign of Trump’s enduring power,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/republicans-trump-big-lie-primary-election-results
5/19/2022,"Gun sales in the US have soared in recent years as the nation struggles to come to terms with the latest mass shooting, a horrific racist attack in Buffalo. According to new figures from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the manufacture of firearms has tripled in two decades, and legal sales have risen sharply as well. Officials in New York confirmed that Payton Gendron, the 18-year-old accused of the Buffalo mass murder, legally obtained the AR-15 style rifle believed to be the weapon used in the attack from a New York guns store, despite being hospitalized last year for making a murder-suicide threat. Law enforcement officials have said they are not aware of any “red flags” that would have slowed or prevented the legal sales of the three guns the shooter allegedly brought to Tops Friendly Market on Saturday, including the one used in the attack. The ATF report comes as many states have loosened “carry” laws that allow for the possession of handguns for personal protection. Since 2009, handgun sales have outstripped rifles, the report found. Total sales rose from 3,040,934 in 1986 to peak in 2016 at 11,497,441. The report also pointed to a rise in the number of “ghost guns”, or untraceable, homemade weapons, in circulation. Law enforcement recovered 19,344 privately manufactured firearms in 2021, a tenfold increase since 2016. Officials have said ghost guns are contributing to the surge in gun-related killings. In California, ghost guns make up as many as half of weapons recovered at crime scenes. On a visit to Buffalo on Tuesday, Joe Biden told reporters that he would redouble his efforts “to convince Congress” to enact new gun control measures. “We’ve done it before,” the president said, referring to the 1994 assault weapons ban that slowed their spread before it lapsed in 2004. Biden said he would have “to convince Congress to go back to what I passed years ago”. “It’s going to be very difficult. But I’m not going to give up trying,” he said. Gendron had been briefly hospitalized last spring after a teacher reported to school administrators that he’d written about wanting to carry out a shooting. But since he was not involuntarily committed to an institution his name was not added to any gun prohibition, or red flag, list. “I spent 20 hours in a hospital’s emergency room on 5/28/2021,” Gendron wrote in an online entry late last year. “This was because I answered murder/suicide to the question ‘what do you want to do when you retire?’ on an online assignment in my Economics class.” Sheriff John Garcia of Erie county, New York, told CNN: “In a case like this the gun dealer was able to sell these weapons to this individual because there was no red flags that came up.” However, Gendron crossed into Pennsylvania to obtain a 30-round magazine. “What has made this so lethal, and so devastating for this community, was the high-capacity magazine that would have had to have been purchased elsewhere, that’s not legal in the state of New York,” Governor Kathy Hochul of New York said on Sunday. Multiple high-capacity magazines were recovered on Gendron and in his car, Buffalo’s police commissioner, Joseph Gramaglia, said. Gendron wrote that using a drill he had modified a lock on the weapon designed to prevent the use of an extended magazine. It is believed he fired 50 rounds during the two-minute attack. Ten people, predominantly Black, were killed and the assault was live-streamed on Twitch. Robert Donald, the owner of Vintage Firearms, told the New York Times he had sold Gendron a Bushmaster rifle. “He didn’t stand out – because if he did, I would’ve never sold him the gun,” Donald said.",News/US news,"Buffalo shooting followed tripling of gun sales in 30 years, ATF figures reveal",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/gun-sales-us-stats-atf-report
5/19/2022,"The Bank of England this week joined the ranks of the “enemies of the people”. Damned for the governor’s gloomy but accurate assessment that UK consumers face an “apocalyptic” spike in food prices, the Bank found itself on the front pages of the populist press. The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street stood accused of being “asleep at the wheel” as prices soared. But hiking interest rates would not have stopped escalating costs. The Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, was right when he said that inflation – which reached a 40-year high of 9% – had been driven by international events. Covid supply chain disruptions, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Brexit are all beyond his control. Higher interest rates are not going to produce more oil or more wheat and bring down the prices of key commodities. The Bank did deliver a fourth successive increase this month to take its lending rate to 1%. Mr Bailey could argue that if he didn’t push up interest rates when other countries were raising theirs, the pound would depreciate – with potentially inflationary consequences. Workers have suffered two decades of stagnant pay. Inflation is more than double the average pay rise. Many workers are refusing to return to jobs at poor pay. So, it appears, the only way of filling vacancies is by making Britons desperate. That would explain why, despite all the crocodile tears about inflation harming ordinary people, ministers and the Bank are determined to stop wages rising. Labour must challenge this dreary orthodoxy. Its call for an emergency budget is the right one to make because only the government can spend the money to help people deal with the cost of living crisis – and signal a better future for workers. Ministers have been briefing that they are considering a “warm home discount” on energy bills for the poorest 3 million, and a 1p cut to the basic income tax rate, brought forward from next year. The former is a small step but a welcome one. The latter is a sop to richer voters as 80% of its benefit goes to the top half of earners. Inflation is not going anywhere soon – and it should be a reckoning for a free market ideology that has come to dominate our political life. If the Conservatives can argue that taxes must come down to deal with inflation, even at the cost of a higher deficit, then surely Labour can argue that public spending could be increased for the same reason. Higher benefits are needed so that the poorest people don’t have to choose between heating and eating. Governments ought to be able to cap housing and loan costs so that ordinary people don’t end up borrowing more just to survive. If oil and gas costs are going to remain high, then surely it is time to implement, in a substantial way, policies to transition to a less energy intensive future – such as free public transport and subsidies for green home renovations. The immediate causes of inflation should not mask the predatory factor of commodity speculation. Wall Street banks are regularly fined for manipulating prices. It is worth recalling that there was plenty of grain to feed the world in February. But provisioning food has turned, to paraphrase John Maynard Keynes, into a byproduct of the activities of a casino, with predictably calamitous results. It is astounding that the Bank of England does not understand these markets – surely a prerequisite for regulating them. The prevailing ideology of the last 40 years has blinded the public to alternatives by deliberately confining the boundaries of public debate. Only by seeing the world as it really is can voters change it.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on fixing inflation: a reckoning with free markets is needed | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/18/the-guardian-view-on-fixing-inflation-a-reckoning-with-free-markets-is-needed
5/19/2022,"There are two traditional means by which MPs are held responsible for their actions. They face the judgment of voters in elections, and they are subject to discipline by party whips. Those are mostly political evaluations, and there is still a large realm where MPs are their own bosses, unchecked in the way that they use their power – able too often to abuse it. Whether parliament contains a disproportionate number of bullies and sexual predators relative to other workplaces is hard to measure. Not all allegations end up being substantiated, but the known cases already give cause for national shame. Last month, Imran Ahmad Khan, a Conservative MP, resigned after being found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. David Warburton, MP for Somerton and Frome, has been suspended from the Tory party pending an inquiry by parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) into an accusation of sexual harassment. He denies the allegations. The ICGS was established in 2018, in response to the flood of stories that emerged when the #MeToo movement reached Westminster. According to one recent report, the scheme is currently considering around 70 complaints relating to 56 MPs, including cabinet and shadow cabinet ministers. This week, a Conservative MP was arrested by police on suspicion of rape and sexual assault. In December 2021, Andrew Griffiths, a former Tory minister, was found by a family court to have raped and physically abused his wife. In 2020, the former Tory MP Charlie Elphicke was jailed for two years after being found guilty of sexual assault. Both men were protected by colleagues when allegations were first made against them. A common thread in many cases is the sense of powerlessness and isolation induced in the victim by a politician who uses patronage and the aura of authority bestowed by his office to exert control. That imbalance makes it easier for the abuser to evade exposure, using his privileged position to discredit accusers and intimidate them into silence. It is a common template for abuse. It happens often in opaque and informal hierarchies, such as political parties, where a young woman can be made to feel that her place depends on tolerating the intolerable, and that she will not be believed if she dares to speak out. In whips’ offices, ideology and expediency too often trump decency and duty of care. None of this is new, nor is it exclusive to one end of the political spectrum. But it is a rot that spreads fastest when power is wielded with impunity, which is more often the condition in parties after long stints in office. That is the state of the current Conservative government. Westminster culture is changing. The era when MPs could behave as unchecked petty tyrants in their own personal fiefdoms is coming to an end. Victims of abuse and harassment are finding their voice. But the pace of change is too slow and, surveying the record, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the present government, stale and arrogant in its long incumbency, has been in power too long to be a credible source of renewal.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on abusive MPs: beware the arrogance of power | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/18/the-guardian-view-on-abusive-mps-beware-the-arrogance-of-power
5/19/2022,"It felt very much like the end of days. An intellectually and morally bankrupt government lurching from one crisis to the next while the country is left to flatline. No one is even surprised these days when yet another Tory MP is accused of sex offences. While we don’t know what the truth of these new allegations will be, the fact that there are fresh claims is no more than people have come to expect. The MP hasn’t even been suspended as he would have been in any other workplace. The ongoing scandal at Westminster is one that might have proved fatally toxic for some administrations, but now has become normalised. Just wait for the next story to break. And with 56 MPs, including three cabinet ministers, being investigated for sexual misconduct, it may not be long before it does. The Commons was nowhere near full for the first prime minister’s questions of the new parliament. Many Tories had clearly decided they were better off out of Westminster than enduring the laboured ramblings of their leader. No one could really blame them. Waiting to take his place on the frontbench, Boris Johnson stood behind the Speaker’s chairs while several of his parliamentary private secretaries patted him down and tried to smarten him up. But Joy Morrissey had no joy. Despite her best efforts, the Convict still looked a complete state. Crumpled, ill-fitting suit held together only by the stains. Tired and pasty-faced. An unbrushed toddler haircut. Johnson can’t clean up his own act, let alone his party’s. With inflation rising to 9%, there was only ever going to be one subject on Keir Starmer’s mind, and he duly devoted all six of his questions to the cost of living. Labour was all in favour of a windfall tax. The Tories had voted against one, even though the chancellor had said only a few days ago that he hadn’t quite made up his mind yet. Rishi Sunak needed a few more people to starve before reaching a decision. So where did Johnson stand? The Convict scratched his head. Then his arse. Not the most attractive of habits. He looked puzzled. His mouth opened and a torrent of disconnected phrases poured out. Boris can no longer speak in complete sentences. Partly because he can’t be bothered, but mainly because he now has no coherent answers to anything. Speech is no longer a form of communication, but more a smokescreen. That’s when he’s not lying, of course. “Um … er,” he mumbled. It was like this. Starmer didn’t even know what a woman was. He seemed to think this was a killer putdown, but he didn’t even get any laughs from his own MPs. It was just random, tone-deaf nonsense. Playing the culture wars card while refusing to acknowledge the genuine hardships many people were suffering was not a good look. The Convict tried to change tack. The government was not, in theory, in favour of putting up taxes. Mmm. Possibly. But it definitely is in practice. Johnson and Sunak have done nothing but put up taxes since they took office. The Labour leader continued to do his own scratching. Though rather more productively, as he was pawing away at the open sore of the windfall tax. A tax that almost everyone in the country thought was a good idea. A tax on which it was inevitable the Tories would be forced to reverse-ferret on within a few weeks. Not that it would be called a windfall tax. That would be an admission that Labour had won the argument. So it would be an excessive profit levy. None of which helped the Convict in his short-term ambition of merely getting through the next half-hour. Because Johnson really didn’t know what he actually wanted, other than for Labour to stop bugging him and for the little people to be more grateful for what he was doing for them. Whatever that was. He couldn’t remember exactly, but he was sure it would come to him in the end. His performance lapsed from the incoherent to the pathetic. Nobody could have predicted the Ukraine war, but it was our duty to suffer alongside the Ukrainian people. The Ukrainians wouldn’t expect a windfall tax at such a time, and neither should we Brits. In fact, Starmer was appeasing Putin by demanding one. The Labour benches just looked bewildered. As did Tory backbenchers. Even by the Convict’s recent standards, this was deranged. Johnson is decomposing before our eyes. Being prime minister is something beyond his shallow talents. He can no longer cope. He was only ever in it for the good times. The parties. The status. The Being There. A tanking, stagflating economy and an imminent recession is beyond his compass. Starmer ended by telling the story of a man who could barely afford the costs of running the dialysis machine that kept him alive. Johnson was choosing to let people like him struggle. The Commons was unusually quiet as the Labour leader spoke, and Johnson should have been humbled. Except the Convict has no shame. The only pity he has is reserved strictly for himself. This was far too real for him, so he pawed the air, as if to bat Starmer away. Then he went on the attack. People should just be grateful they had jobs to do as they went hungry and cold. If they wanted luxuries, why didn’t they just get jobs that paid a bit more, like Rachel Maclean had said? Hell, he had taken a pay cut to be prime minister, so how about a bit of sympathy for his suffering? And what about some applause for Crossrail? That was all down to him. It wasn’t, of course. It had been Ken Livingstone’s idea. But hey, if the Convict wants to take the credit for an infrastructure project that was years late and massively over budget, then who are we to stop him? The rest of PMQs passed in a haze of anticlimactic apathy, the only highlight being Johnson insisting that no one worked well from home. He can speak for himself. Labour could only sit and wait. They could make suggestions, but there was nothing they could do to force the government to tackle the cost of living crisis. The Tories, too, could only sit and wait, though they only had their crippling indecision to blame. They knew the Convict was just a hollowed-out, corroded hulk. There was no saviour rising from the streets to come to their rescue.",News/Politics,Johnson is so short of answers he can no longer form complete sentences | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/18/boris-johnson-pmqs-cost-of-living-crisis
5/19/2022,"The White House resumed its coronavirus briefings on Wednesday after a six-week hiatus as Covid-19 cases rose across the nation, with the new head of Covid response calling on Congress for additional funding to pay for vaccines and treatments. “I want to make sure we have enough resources so that we can buy enough vaccines for every American. I think that is absolutely critical. We do not have the resources to do that right now,” said Ashish Jha, the White House’s new coronavirus response coordinator, who replaced Jeff Zients in March. “So without additional funding from Congress, we will not be able to buy enough vaccines for every American who wants one.” The last White House coronavirus briefing was held on 5 April. Since then, various mask mandates have been lifted across the country, including those on planes, trains and in automobiles. Jha explained that the administration has not stopped fighting the virus, however, noting that it has increased its rapid test kits allocated to each household from four to eight kits. “We know there are multigenerational households, we know that there are households with more than four people and we want to make sure that we make as many tests as we can possibly make available,” he said. Jha also revealed that the administration has seen a dramatic increase in the use of the Covid-19 pill Paxlovid, with demand increasing fourfold in just the previous month. “Our latest estimates are that about 20,000 prescriptions of Paxlovid are being given out every day. I think that is actually a really important reason why, despite the very substantial increase in infections, we have not seen a commensurate increase in deaths,” Jha said. Jha also renewed his pleas for Congress to authorize additional funding so the government could purchase more vaccines and Covid-19 treatments. “If we don’t get more resources from Congress, what we will find in the fall and winter is … a period of time where Americans can look around and see their friends in other countries in Europe and Canada with access to these treatments that Americans would not have.” The resumed briefing comes as the US marks a grim milestone, now that more than 1 million people have been officially counted dead since the pandemic began in March 2020, and the real number likely to be much higher. The US has one of the highest mortality rates in the world: 303 dead from Covid-19 out of every 100,000 residents, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The huge toll has set the US apart from other wealthy nations, in a crisis exacerbated by the country’s deep-rooted inequality, broken healthcare system and fraught politics. “In terms of understanding why we had such a bad experience from the pandemic, we have to think about the systemic issues that already were in place when the pandemic arrived,” Steven Woolf, a social epidemiologist and population health researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University, told the Guardian. “And, on top of that, mishandling of the pandemic by the government and by the public, frankly.” According to data from the New York Times, for the first time since 20 February, the daily average of Covid-19 cases in the country surpassed 100,000, marking a 61% rise from two weeks ago. Although deaths have been declining, hospitalizations have been on the rise: up by 25% in the past two weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, Rochelle Walensky, reaffirmed the importance of booster shots at the briefing. “Our vaccine effectiveness cohort studies have shown Covid-19 vaccines generally remain effective in preventing severe disease, including protecting against Omicron. However, we also know that protection from Covid-19 vaccines wanes, or becomes less protective over time, especially in the Omicron era,” she said. “This is one of the reasons vaccine boosters are so important.”",News/US news,White House resumes Covid briefings after six-week hiatus as cases rise,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/covid-briefings-biden-white-house-us-cases-rising
5/19/2022,"Olivia Bennett’s VHS collection started at a charity stall. She had grown up in “the type of family where we’ll always have a movie on in the background,” she says, but it wasn’t until high school that her personal interest really bloomed. It was 2010 and DVD sales in Australia were booming. People were shedding their old VHS cassettes like dead skin. Many of them, apparently, found their way onto a Lifeline table operating out of the convention centre opposite Bennett’s house in Brisbane. At 50 cents for five, she couldn’t pass up the chance to snag a handful of beloved titles on the cheap (“It was a money thing”). And then another, and then another. “My mum and I would take trolleys … each time we were going in. And we’d go several times a day [a day] and sort through.” More than a decade on, she has a thousand-strong collection which adorns one entire living room wall in her family home – edge to edge – a wallpaper of plastic anachronisms. There are “obscure Disney films like Sword in the Stone and Pete’s Dragon,” she says, alongside cult classics like Jim Henson’s Labyrinth. In the photo she sends me, three copies of Lethal Weapon take pride of place. While she’s now moved interstate, her collection back in Brisbane has held steady throughout the advent – then stranglehold – of streaming. The movies themselves may have made the jump online, but one of Bennett’s treasured features has not: the pre-show ads in all their grainy, campy glory. “There’s always that ad that’s like, ‘Don’t pirate!’ … [and] there were a lot of theatrics to trailers. You know that classic American voiceover for all the trailers? Something about that voice reminds me of a specific time.” Nostalgia is a primary force driving collectors of physical film media, whose titles sometimes predate them. Bennett’s VHS tapes, she says, are a lens to experience “the 90s … a period of time that I was born in but didn’t necessarily get to grow up in”. For others, a commitment to hard copy is the only way to skirt around the fickle decisions of streaming services, where availability of titles is subject to an impenetrable alchemy of considerations: audience demand, the whims of licensing, and sheer storage capacity. “It’s insanely expensive to store stuff for it to be streamed,” says Dr Ari Mattes, a media lecturer at the University of Notre Dame, whose own DVD and VHS collection numbers somewhere in the 40,000s. “It’s not like going to a video store … you can’t have 50,000 titles on a streaming service.” Ben Kenny, the owner of the now-defunct Film Club – Sydney’s self-described “last, best” video store – agrees. “The only way to be sure that you’ll have access to something forever is to actually own a physical copy of it.” Over its decade-long life, Film Club gained a reputation for servicing “that five or 10% of whatever generation is obsessed with films,” says Kenny, who describes the community which formed around his store as “the island of misfit toys”. When it shuttered this February, collectors all around Sydney made the pilgrimage into Darlinghurst to snap up the goods in a closing sale. Titles went fast. Some, like a 2008 Criterion Collection version of Wong Kar-wai’s Chungking Express, had been long out of print, with resales on eBay costing hundreds of dollars. “We just got hit hard by people who had clearly been eyeing off things … customers knew the value of a lot of the stuff we had. But it was good to see it go to a good home.” The scarcity of some hard copy film editions isn’t all that different to rare books, says Geoff Gardner, the founder of Cinema Reborn, a boutique film festival in Sydney dedicated to screening classics seldom seen on the big screen. There are ways, of course, to bypass the shortcomings of streaming services through what he winkingly calls “the backchannels” and “the illegitimate”, but it doesn’t compare to the solidity of “filing it away, putting it in the box”. “It’s the same as the book collector’s mentality.

And if in a wild moment you think you want to see six Joan Crawford films in a night…” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning His personal stash now clocks in at 8,000 DVDs, amassed over decades. But that’s nothing, he goes to great pains to emphasise, compared to fellow cinephiles. “A lot of people are very, very remorseless … they’ll spend hours in the DVD shops [overseas] finding films that have not been released in other places, but have been released in Italy, Spain, or Japan.” The subculture Gardner describes is holding steadfast. But could it ever experience a proper resurgence – like its cousin, the vinyl revival of the last decade? “With vinyl, the audio quality is actually better in terms of the range that you’re able to hear, which isn’t the case with DVDs,” says Mattes, “[But there’ll always be] something about a physical medium – the tactility of it … There’s just something innately comforting about that.”. A return to older formats, even for the average viewer, says Mattes, might also go some way in alleviating selection fatigue – the hours spent scrolling online, undone by the tyranny of choice. “Say you’re a normal person, not like me with an insane number [of titles] … when you go to pick something, it limits your choice in a really productive way. “You can look at your collection and go, ‘okay, I’ve got [a finite] number to pick from’ … instead of the absolute doubt that you have on streaming. “[There’ll always be] something about a physical medium – the tactility of it … There’s just something innately comforting about that.”",Arts/Film,‘There’s something comforting about it’: the collectors who won’t let go of their DVDs and videos,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/19/theres-something-comforting-about-it-the-collectors-who-wont-let-go-of-their-dvds-and-videos
5/19/2022,"Amal Naser initially believed the election was a chance for change, particularly for the Muslim community, and for western Sydney. But as the election enters its final week, Naser now says it is a choice between a “lesser evil” and Scott Morrison. “No one sees Labor as a party they would feel very incentivised to vote for, except for the fact that they want to vote the Liberal government out,” she says. The 21-year-old law student says that while Labor has a “longstanding relationship” with the Muslim community, that relationship is now “hanging by a thread.” “There are barely any policies, definitely nothing radical, proposed by the Labor party that is actively mobilising the Muslim community, particularly younger Muslims.” Naser reflects a changing attitude within western Sydney’s Muslim community, one that is less afraid of raising concerns and demanding better representation. But there is a frustration at the level of engagement from both parties, largely attributed to the fact that many of the electorates where Muslims live in New South Wales are largely Labor safe seats, such as Blaxland, Fowler and Watson. The same dynamic plays out in Victoria, with Muslims concentrated in the Labor safe seats of Wills, Calwell and Maribyrnong. According to the 2016 census, 59.2% of residents in Lakemba identify as Muslim, and at the 2019 election, Labor won Watson (which includes Lakemba, Greenacre, and Punchbowl, all with sizeable Muslim populations) by 13.5%. Some polling booth results in Lakemba showed the Labor vote at over 75%. But neighbouring seats in western Sydney with smaller Muslim populations, such as Lindsay and Banks, have already flipped, with many others in the region becoming marginal. A recent report from the Centre for Western Sydney found a growing “electoral volatility” in western Sydney, predicting that the region will no longer be a stronghold for either major party. It listed growing political literacy combined with lower levels of education attainment, and higher rates of multilingualism, cultural diversity and religious faith as major reasons for the shifting landscape. Naser, who lives in the seat of Banks, thinks the shift can be somewhat attributed to Labor’s attitude toward the community. “If the Labor party hadn’t taken our community for granted for so many years, and actively work with our community on the plethora of issues that we face, and a more radical platform, then people might have felt a greater need to vote for them,” she said. A generational shift in the community, from early migrants seeking to establish themselves in the 80s and 90s to a second and third generation that is wealthier and more educated, is also reshaping priorities for Muslim voters. Dr Lobna Yassine, lecturer in social work and policy studies at the University of Sydney, says that she is voting for the Greens at this election, breaking away from a family tradition of voting Labor. “I voted Labor without thought or question because my parents voted Labor,” she said. “People of my parents’ generation tried very hard to influence policies, without causing too much discomfort or disruption. I think this makes sense in the context of their limited power, and by the fact that they were pretty much limited to the two major parties.” “Liberal positioned as more conservative on issues like immigration, and Labor more compassionate on issues of immigration and welfare policy.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Yassine explains that the changing demographics of the Muslim community was causing the electoral landscape to shift, with growing rates of education, more professionals and greater wealth resulting in changing priorities. “We are now in a position to say “if you do not share our priorities or our concerns, we will take away our vote and place it with a party that does”. “In my community, a lot of us are constantly talking about other issues of concern such as atrocities committed by Israel, equality for First Nations people and Black Lives Matter, climate change, and gender equality.” Yassine says the changes are creating a “split” within the community, between those who want to maintain the traditional relationship with Labor and power, and those who want to take charge of their vote. And it is resulting in changes to their expectations of religious leaders. “There is conflict within the community about whether or not we should be continuing to invite parties into our community events, despite their lack of commitment to the issues that concern us directly.” She says hundreds of people have boycotted Lakemba mosque, one of the most prominent mosques in the country, for inviting politicians without attempting to hold them to account. These divisions have left the community without a clear sense of who to support, and which party would actually act in their interests. Lakemba mosque did not respond to requests for comment. A Labor spokesperson denied the party had taken the community for granted, and blamed Scott Morrison for communities feeling disenfranchised. “It is understandable that multicultural communities would feel disenfranchised when they see Scott Morrison turning up only for photo ops and pork barreling. “What we’ve heard is the issues that are concerning Muslim Australians are the cost-of-living crisis, housing affordability and job stability.” “Of course there’s always more we can do – and we don’t take our relationships with Muslim communities for granted.” Criminologist and former executive director of the Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV) Mohamad Tabbaa calls it a “double bind”, explaining that Muslims don’t fit neatly on a political spectrum between the left and right. “They must vote in one direction or another, and yet doing so necessarily brings a harm to themselves and to their communities,” he said “The double bind puts Muslims in unhealthy relation with themselves and their communities.” “Muslims do not face a general lack of choice, they face a lack of choices that understand their concerns and needs, that allow them to vote with the dignity of not betraying themselves, their communities and their values.” A growing distance between assumptions made of the community, and approaches made by the major parties was reflected in a recent community survey that showed rightwing extremism and Islamophobia were two major concerns they held. My Vote Matters ran the survey, and found 53% of respondents said they were “extremely concerned” about Islamophobia, with 46% saying they were just as concerned about rightwing extremism. Religious freedoms were also overwhelmingly supported, with 96% saying they wanted to see legislation that protects their ability to live by their religious principles. Adel Salman, current president of the ICV, the organisation behind My Vote Matters, defined religious freedoms for Muslims as being about preventing vilification and discrimination on the basis of religion, as well as preserving their right to live by their values. “At its core, it is about preserving your rights and upholding the rights of people of faith to live by their values, and to educate and raise their children according to those values.” “Those things are under assault at the moment,” he added. Salman says that while there is greater interest in the Coalition, the relationship between the Muslim community and Labor has been fracturing for some time. “It fell apart at the last election,” he says “Muslims have been feeling betrayed by Labor, in that they are not representing their views or values.” “Among the Muslim community, you’ll still have those who are diehard Labor, but the Labour party is on notice now, they cannot take the Muslim vote for granted.”",News/Australia news,‘Taken for granted’: western Sydney’s Muslim community rethinks a fractured Labor relationship,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/taken-for-granted-western-sydneys-muslim-community-rethinks-a-fractured-labor-relationship
5/19/2022,"The unbearable costs and instability of the rental crisis are pushing more people towards crowdfunding for accommodation, with housing-related appeals on one of Australia’s biggest fundraising platforms more than quadrupling over the past year. The campaigns range from requests for assistance with rental arrears and covering the costs of temporary accommodation, to appeals for help to buy caravans or other forms of mobile accommodation in the face of homelessness. Data from crowdfunding platform GoFundMe released to Guardian Australia shows that in the 12 months between May 2020 and May 2021, there had been 37 local fundraising campaigns on the platform related specifically to providing basic housing and accommodation needs. In the year following, there were 158 – an increase of 327%. Of those campaigns launched in the last 12 months, 53 of them, or 34%, were launched in the last 90 days. Those running some of the campaigns described to Guardian Australia how difficult it had been for them to step forward and ask for help with their personal circumstances in such a public way. For Louise Scarff, the decision to allow her friend Bianca Otto to set up a fundraising campaign for a campervan came after she received six weeks’ notice to vacate her home of seven years so the owners could renovate, and found herself and her three children thrust into an overheated rental market. Rental prices on many parts of the Mornington Peninsula where she lives have risen more than 20% in the past two years. Vacancies were low, affordable properties were scant, and those that did pop up had hundreds of applicants, many of whom could make huge downpayments on rent. Scarff, who works multiple jobs while juggling her family commitments, felt the only way through was to give up on trying to find a house, shed most of her belongings, and buy a campervan that her family could live and travel in. “I don’t know if I’ve got any other option,” she said. “There are so many things you need in order to participate in the system and there’s a cost to that, and it’s getting bigger and bigger. “I don’t know if I can live like this any more. I feel like every day I’m going to work to come home and find myself 10 steps backwards. It’s a real strain emotionally on myself and my children. I don’t get any time to spend with them or enjoy the simple things in life.” The campervan, though, would require an outlay of funds that she could not access on her own. “It’s quite confronting to step in there and say, ‘I can’t do this by myself, this is beyond me, I do really need more resources’,” Scarff said. Sarah Mottram had also been reluctant to go down the crowdfunding route. A sole parent to a young girl, Mottram said she had always been able to meet her rental obligations and had lived with her daughter in a stable rental property in Melbourne’s south-east for many years. Earlier this year, unexpected changes to Mottram’s Centrelink payments left her without sufficient income to make ends meet for several weeks. She challenged the changes and her payments were eventually reinstated, but by then she was $1,400 in arrears. She contacted community organisations and support services in her area for assistance but found they were inundated with need. “Dignity is really important to me,” Mottram said. “I want to respect the agreements I’ve made. I want to honour them. And my real estate agent and my landlord have been really understanding. But I have no means of drawing support from anywhere else at the moment. “My budget is so tight that I can’t see a way that I could ever scrimp enough to pay the owed amount and despite my efforts I am out of time,” she wrote on her GoFundMe page. Mottram said she didn’t believe the welfare system had enough resources to deal with the need in the community. “Maybe there needs to be some respite for people that are working in the [welfare] system – I don’t particularly blame them, but there’s a massive indifference there to homelessness, even for mothers who have dependent children,” she said. “People need access to funds, access to support. You’re looking for work and trying to retain your dignity, and you’re getting spoken down to.” GoFundMe, like other crowdfunding platforms, benefits financially from campaigns run on its platform, garnishing a small percentage of each donation and issuing a transaction fee to hosts. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The director of GoFundMe, Nicola Britton, told Guardian Australia that the trends on the platform tended to give “a clear picture of those falling through the cracks of traditional support”. “The response we are seeing to the housing crisis is reflective of a much deeper systemic issue that requires special attention,” Britton said, expressing concern that while fundraising campaigns may help in the short term, they were not a long-term solution. Kate Colvin, a spokesperson for housing advocacy organisation Everybody’s Home, said the increasing number of fundraisers for housing costs were “not at all surprising”, and called on the winner of Saturday’s federal election to invest in social housing. “Renters on low incomes have been cast to the wolves of the housing market, without enough income to compete, and without policy from the federal government to do anything to address the huge shortfall in supply of affordable rentals,” Colvin said. “The top priority for whoever forms government this weekend is to provide more homes that low waged workers and others on low incomes can afford so that everyone has a home.”",News/Australia news,Desperate tenants are turning to crowdfunding to pay for housing amid Australia’s rental crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/desperate-tenants-are-turning-to-crowdfunding-to-pay-for-housing-amid-australias-rental-crisis
5/19/2022,"The federal election campaign is “clearly a case of Covid Fight Club,” Prof Stuart Turville says. “Don’t talk about it.” Turville, a virologist at the University of New South Wales, wonders when Australia’s continuous Covid-19 deaths and slowing booster shot rates “will become an issue of discussion within our government”. Almost 7,900 Covid deaths have occurred in Australia since the pandemic began, with at least 66 of those on Tuesday alone, and 53 more on Wednesday. More than 1,000 deaths were reported in the past month. Meanwhile otherwise healthy, triple-dosed people are reporting coronavirus symptoms significant enough to require bedrest for days, as hospitals and the broader health system buckles, not only because of the virus infecting staff but also because of years of under-resourcing and under-funding. And many Australians are still wondering if they will eventually need a fourth dose of a Covid vaccine, or if existing vaccines will be tweaked to better respond to new variants. The current vaccines are extremely effective at achieving their primary task: preventing people from developing severe disease and ending up in hospital. But Covid infection rates in Australia are rising, leaving immunocompromised and other vulnerable people who are less protected by the vaccines particularly worried. Rates of people getting their vaccine booster doses are slowing: about 19.7m Australians aged 16 and over are double-dosed, compared with about 13.6m who have had three or more doses. Neither major party has announced policies or new funding for vaccinations or the long-term impacts of Covid ahead of the election. “Time will tell us how complacency at many levels will play out,” Turville says. “What will happen if we don’t get our third or fourth dose? Will we see the death rate per day creep up from 40, to 60, to 80 before we start to talk about this again? “We need to ensure those who have been working on the response to this virus keep at it. The best way to do that is for the government and also industry to continue to fund the response.” Experts say that funding must include better tracking of Covid-19 infection rates and deaths within Australia, as international comparisons have become less meaningful given vast differences in how countries test and report cases. It used to be easier to track the virus and compare data. For a long time, because of restrictions, few people were infected in Australia, allowing almost every case to be studied. There were no vaccines, so researchers could determine how the immune system responded to the virus alone. There were far fewer variants, making it clearer what any one strain of the virus was doing. Turville says now “the Band-Aid is being ripped off”. “The immunity in the community is a real mix,” he says. “It’s a hybrid of prior infection then vaccination, or vaccination then infection, or a booster then infection. It’s interesting at many levels, but also complex.” This mix of variables also makes it harder to study how long protection against the virus lasts. “Modelling a decaying [immune] response now involves several starting points,” Turville says. “Was it your booster, or your last Covid-19 infection?” Small changes in the virus were tolerated by the available vaccines, which responded well to the Delta and Alpha variants. But then Omicron came along. “The viral entry pathway changed and in doing so the virus crawled up the respiratory tract,” Turville says. “Many people are infected with Omicron following their booster dose. They can readily transmit it as well. The fact is, we still don’t know how this immunity will track over time, and more importantly, what variant we will meet in the future.” Prof Sharon Lewin, an infectious diseases physician and director of the Doherty Institute, says what this will all mean for Australia’s vaccination program is being considered by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi), which advises the government. “We do know from large studies, primarily from Israel, that immunity against Omicron gradually wanes after the third dose, meaning your protection against infection reduces,” Lewin says. “But your protection against hospitalisation is quite well maintained after your third dose, which is really the most important thing. Israel has shown in older populations 60 and above, a fourth dose further reduces risk of hospitalisation, including from Omicron.” Atagi recommends certain groups receive a fourth dose to maximise their protection against severe illness. That includes adults aged 65 and older, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the age of 50, aged care and disability care residents, and anyone aged 16 and older who is severely immunocompromised. “At the moment, the benefit of protection against hospitalisation from a fourth dose hasn’t been shown for the general population,” Lewin says. “That may change as we get more data, and Atagi are actively monitoring the situation.” In the meantime, Prof Julie Leask, from the University of Sydney’s Institute for Infectious Diseases, says two-dose coverage in Australia “has definitely hit a high ceiling” at 95.6% for those aged 16 and above. Booster coverage is now at 70%, and primary schooler double-dose vaccination coverage is at 53%. Leask believes without ongoing vaccine campaigns and attention from governments, the vaccination rates in these groups will only “slowly crawl upwards”. “We need to increase our booster coverage, particularly for people at highest risk of severe disease,” Leask says. “This remains urgent particularly as we head into winter. “We also need high flu vaccination coverage. This is always an issue, but this time there is more immune naivety in the population from two years without much flu.” Leask says it is frustrating to see a lack of political urgency around these issues. “Unfortunately, public health seems to have dropped off the radar all together in the lead-up to the election,” she says. “The new government should urgently review our vaccination situation and plan a national campaign to both remind and persuade people to be up to date with their vaccinations. More broadly, we need to know what the major parties plan to do about a pandemic review, and public health workforce.” It remains unclear why so many eligible people aren’t getting their third booster dose, Leask says. “Australia needs timely and routine deep-dives on why people don’t vaccinate, so we can target the strategies,” she said. “Second guessing people leads to inefficiencies, because governments sometimes assumes they know and can miss the mark. Once the disease comes, it’s too late. This is the most challenging thing about promoting vaccine uptake.”",News/World news,‘Don’t talk about Covid’: major parties accused of virus complacency during election campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/dont-talk-about-covid-major-parties-accused-of-virus-complacency-during-election-campaign
5/19/2022,"Scott Morrison’s re-election pitch is built on a mirage – the false hope that the havoc of three years of fires, pandemics and floods is over and we are entering a “time of opportunity” when he can be a nicer version of himself and we, with a collective sigh of relief, can return to pursuing our personal aspirations. But the pandemic isn’t over. More than 5,600 Australians with Covid-19 have died this year, more than twice the number who died in the previous 24 months. And it exposed disturbing fissures in Australian society; the underfunded hospitals and public schools, the underpaid care workers, the shockingly inadequate aged care system, and the desperate need for an unemployment payment at a livable rate. The government did cushion the human and economic impact of the pandemic by closing the borders and putting businesses and workers on government support, but returning to a new kind of “normal” life has highlighted other crises; families are living in cars and tents because they cannot afford housing, and household budgets are at breaking point because of the soaring price of food and essentials. Full-time workers are reliant on food banks. The climate crisis is a lived reality, its consequences a rolling national trauma. The tectonic plates of geopolitics are shifting, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This is not a time for slogans of false reassurance. Australia needs to learn from what we are enduring, rethink priorities and reset for what is to come. As a nation, we need to muster all our smarts and all our resources to meet these challenging times. As the prime minister said in a speech this month: “The job’s too big to be small.” But neither major party is offering a transformative agenda in this campaign. Neither is offering policies commensurate with the task. Determined not to fall at the finish line, as Bill Shorten did in 2019, and mindful of an electorate wary of more upheaval, Anthony Albanese is positioning as a “safe” change. His platform is deliberately modest and, in places, sorely lacking. But it does address some of the biggest challenges where Mr Morrison’s does not. On global heating, the existential issue upending our lives, this campaign has glossed over policy differences between the major parties because both have promised to reach net zero emissions by 2050 (although some in the Coalition remain unconvinced). But Mr Morrison’s promise is a veneer. He has a slogan, “Technology not taxes”, but almost no policies to reach the target he promised at the Glasgow summit. The vaunted $22bn for technology investment includes expanding gas-fired power and hydrogen made from fossil fuels. Wholesale power prices are increasing precisely because the Coalition has so woefully mismanaged the transition to renewables. Labor’s modest plan, to speed up building transmission lines and activate a Coalition policy to reduce industrial emissions, is also inadequate. But it has been comprehensively supported by business because it at least makes a start on the economic transition that has to come. In three years a Coalition government will have subsidised new fossil fuel extraction and its 2050 target will be even less plausible than it is now. After a decade of confected, scandalous, time-wasting “climate wars” for political advantage, we cannot squander three more years. On the services essential for a decent society, Labor also has more to offer. On aged care, for example, Mr Albanese matched the government’s big spending increase in response to the royal commission, added $2.5bn, and – critically – said he would support and fund the current wage claims by aged care workers. On the national disability insurance scheme he has promised a review to make sure support plans are not arbitrarily cut. He is promising more for GPs and healthcare. Sadly, neither party has promised any further increase to payments for the unemployed, which remain below the poverty line. Labor has also largely matched the government’s efforts to ease cost-of-living pressures, including the temporary measures in the budget and increased subsidies for medicines, and has offered much more generous assistance for childcare, arguing that this spending helps both families and national productivity. As interest rates rise and homeownership becomes a pipe dream for many Australians, each of the major parties is offering modest plans to help people into the property market – neither really addressing the crisis nor doing much to increase housing supply. Then Mr Morrison activated the controversial idea to allow first-homebuyers to access some of their superannuation for a deposit, a last-minute point of political difference – but poor public policy likely to drive house prices even higher. Labor has a fund to build affordable housing but neither major party is promising to increase the subsidy for low-income renters, despite a finding that no rental properties are affordable for someone on government benefits, and only 2% are affordable for someone on a minimum wage. Critically, Labor has also promised to move quickly on a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice to parliament, unfinished business for justice and reconciliation that is opposed by the Coalition. Voters across the political spectrum are disgusted by rorts and pork barrelling and the lack of accountability in federal politics, fuelling deep disillusionment and corroding trust in the democratic system. But Mr Morrison is obstinately clinging to an integrity commission model that experts say would be worse than nothing at all, arguing, implausibly, that corruption is primarily a problem for the states and that politicians should enjoy an unfettered ability to spend taxpayer funds as they choose. Labor, by contrast, has promised a federal Icac with teeth. And then there are the challenges for whoever wins on Saturday – record levels of national debt and the largest budget deficit on record, or the more precarious foreign policy environment underscored by Solomon Islands’ decision to sign a security pact with China – where the parties’ stances are broadly similar despite attempts to contrive differences. It is the roll call of the Coalition’s policy vacuum and inadequate answers on so many issues that matter, rather than any sweeping or comprehensive ambition from Labor, that makes a compelling case for a change of government on 21 May. Guardian Australia believes that case is compounded by the leadership styles of the two men vying to be prime minister. Australians have watched Mr Morrison’s leadership for years. Fearful of defeat, he now concedes he may have come across as a “bulldozer” at times, but only because he was intent on “getting things done”. But getting things done to what end? The record shows he has too often elevated political expediency over decent outcomes – the reckoning over the toxic workplace culture for women in Parliament House and the political weaponisation of transgender children being just two cases in point. Mr Albanese’s leadership qualities are untested in office but he has united Labor. The electorate may not be wildly inspired by him but a personable consensus style of leadership based on policy commitment may be exactly what it needs. The polls tell us that many voters, disillusioned by these choices, are turning to smaller parties and independents. Some support the Greens, who are campaigning on ending new coal and gas projects, adding dental care to Medicare, offering affordable homes and abolishing student debt – instead of proceeding with the next round of personal income tax cuts. Many have been inspired by the grassroots “voices of” independents movement, joining, with renewed hope that politics can be different, campaigns in the inner-city “teal” electorates and also in some seats in the regions. The teals have stared down increasingly hysterical criticisms from the Coalition that their election would cause chaos. (We would point to the demonstrated productivity of the last hung parliament elected in 2010.) If these independents, alongside the Greens, were to hold the balance of power in a hung parliament, Guardian Australia believes policy could be influenced for the better. If Liberal moderates do lose inner-city seats to the teals, the Coalition will face a history-defining choice – to heed the lessons of those losses and return to the political centre or to veer further towards the populist right. We do not believe this is a reason to shun the teals – the Liberal moderates have had a decade in government when they could have fought harder for their causes – but such a result could be a lasting consequence of this election. And if Mr Morrison were to pull off another “miracle” victory, it would be via his canny preference deals with the United Australia party and, to a lesser extent, One Nation – minor parties that are harvesting the same voter dissatisfaction but with strategic cynicism rather than grassroots enthusiasm and hope. One Nation is so distant from some of the constituencies it is contesting it was forced to find candidates from different states, including the candidate to whom the deputy prime minister is directing his second preferences. The UAP is outspending even the major parties with advertisements promising superficially attractive but completely undeliverable policies, including capping home loan interest rates at 3%. The Coalition’s siren song of returning to a time of pre-pandemic calm might be enticing, but it’s an illusion. Australia cannot afford three more years of Scott Morrison’s self-serving spin and negligent inaction. Despite his limited agenda, Anthony Albanese offers the best hope that we will rise to the challenges ahead. The election of grassroots independents or Greens candidates could influence an Albanese government for the better. Based on his record, and his threadbare re-election agenda, Guardian Australia believes Scott Morrison has forfeited the right to another term.",News/Australia news,The Guardian view on the Australian federal election: say no to spin and inaction,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-australian-federal-election-say-no-to-spin-and-inaction
5/19/2022,"The latest wage price index figures confirm that when Australians go to the polls this Saturday, their real wages will be lower than at the last federal election. Not only that, but so bad has been the fall that real wages are now essentially no different from what they were when Tony Abbott took office in 2013. In the latest minutes of the Reserve Bank board, the bank noted it decided not to wait for this latest wage data because while the board “agreed that this information would be helpful … the recent evidence on wages growth from the Bank’s liaison and business surveys was clear”. I suspect they were talking to people other than those earning a wage, because the latest wage price index showed there was no increase in the annual growth of wages of 2.4%: If the graph does not display please click here Private sector wages have now been growing annually at 2.4% for the past three quarters. After the recovery from the abnormal slow growth that occurred during the lockdowns of the pandemic, growth has hit a ceiling it is struggling to break. Quarterly growth in March saw no increase from the growth in the last three months of 2021. Far from a big surge in wages driving up inflation, the 0.7% quarterly increase is some 1.4 percentage points below the 2.1% quarterly growth of the consumer price index in the March quarter: If the graph does not display click here It really shows how big of a lie the spin is that we need to be careful wages don’t start forcing up prices. But it is actually worse when you dig into the figures. The major issue of inflation since the pandemic is that the price of non-discretionary items – ie those things you can’t avoid paying, like food, utilities, petrol, insurance – has risen faster than for discretionary items. In the past year the prices of non-discretionary items rose 6.6%: If the graph does not display click here Given lower-paid workers spend more of their income on non-discretionary items than the average household, this means those workers have seen a truly massive drop in their standard of living. And the low rate of jobseeker is a factor here. As Kristin O’Connell, the spokesperson for the Anti-Poverty Centre has noted, fear of having to go back onto jobseeker is a strong disincentive to bargain for higher wages. She argues that “Jobseeker payments are so unliveable that people have little power to push for higher wages even if they’re earning poverty wages from their paid work”. And for all workers, the fall in real wages is historically large. The 2.6% fall over the past 12 months is so great that it means real wages are now 2.2% below what they were at the 2019 election, 1.5% below what they were at the 2016 election and essentially the same as they were in September 2013: If the graph does not display click here It really does put all talk about a strong recovery from the pandemic into context. Yes, GDP has recovered, and yes unemployment has fallen, but the ability of workers to buy things with their wages has fallen. Talking about GDP growth is often a bit pointless. You can’t eat GDP, but right now you can’t buy more with your wages than you could three, six or nine years ago.

5/19/2022,"Aged care providers have reported more than 350 Covid deaths since the election campaign began and continue to grapple with at least 60 deaths a week, government data shows. An analysis of government data, conducted by the United Workers Union and confirmed by the Guardian, shows that Covid deaths in aged care facilities are now occurring at rates unseen in the first two years of the pandemic. Aged care workers are preparing to strike across the country again on Friday, furious at low pay, torrid conditions, and a lack of recognition of the huge workload and workforce pressures caused by Covid. The latest government report shows 1,418 Covid deaths have been reported by aged care providers so far in 2022, accounting for about one in four of all Covid deaths in Australia. That dwarfs the 686 deaths in aged care in 2020 and 231 deaths in 2021. In the last three weeks on record, there were 65, 89, and 85 deaths reported by aged care facilities respectively. The average deaths a week this year has hovered at about 75. There were 761 active outbreaks in aged care facilities in the week up to 13 May, including 205 in New South Wales, 191 in Victoria, 120 in South Australia, 100 in Queensland, and 103 in Western Australia. More than 3,300 aged care residents and 1,999 staff were Covid positive in those 761 outbreaks. The UWU’s analysis of data for individual aged care providers showed 39 facilities in five states have recorded five deaths or more this year, with nine recording deaths in double figures. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Wednesday said Australia was now “living with Covid”, dismissing suggestions of further lockdowns or mask mandates to limit Covid-19 transmission in the community. Morrison was asked whether the death toll was acceptable and what he was doing to curtail it on Wednesday. He said each death was a “terrible loss”. “As the number of cases has risen, that’s what was always going to happen,” he told reporters. “What you see when you have case numbers of that level is that people, when they pass away from many other causes, they will die with Covid, and their deaths are recorded as Covid deaths – but that doesn’t necessarily mean … that they passed away because of Covid. That’s a very different proposition.” The UWU’s aged care director, Carolyn Smith, questioned why Covid had disappeared from the public debate, when 350 older Australians had died during the election campaign alone. “Aged care workers are continuing to turn up to care for residents while these political leaders are only turning up for campaign photo opps,” she said. Smith said the pandemic continued to be distressing for aged care residents who were locked up in their rooms, and devastating for families and workers, who were shouldering huge workloads. “There is a public perception the Omicron wave has passed but for aged care workers working double shifts in full PPE there has been no let up and the aged care crisis is in full swing,” she said. Aged care workers are expected to strike on Friday in SA and Queensland as they fight for better wages and conditions. The sector has also pleaded with the government to fund a pay rise and to improve funding for Covid prevention. A spokesperson for the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, said the government continued to ensure older Australians have access to Covid and flu vaccines in the current comprehensive rollout. The spokesperson said Australia had fared far better than other nations in its handling of aged care deaths. “While every single Covid-related death in aged care is a tragedy, a global comparison in death data clearly illustrates how the measures implemented as part of the Government’s pandemic plan has saved tens of thousands of lives,” he said. “Our comprehensive winter dose program will ensure these protections continue.”",News/Australia news,Scale of aged care Covid deaths laid bare as staff prepare to strike,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/scale-of-aged-care-covid-deaths-laid-bare-as-staff-prepare-to-strike
5/19/2022,"The major parties are often dismissed as being too similar, but here are seven key issues where there are real policy differences between the two major parties. Labor has promised registered nurses will be on site 24/7 in every residential aged care facility in the country. It will also mandate that every resident receives an average of 215 minutes of care per day, as recommended by the damning aged care royal commission. Labor has also pledged to back aged care workers’ case for a 25% pay rise in the Fair Work Commission and has promised to fund the outcome of the case. It has promised to improve the food delivered to residents of aged care facilities by developing and implementing mandatory nutrition standards, and will push for greater transparency and accountability in the sector by making providers report publicly what they are spending government money on. Since the royal commission, the Coalition has announced a five-year $19.1bn aged care plan, which includes a major boost to home care of 40,000 new home care packages. The package also includes a boost to respite services, 7,000 new personal care workers, and 48,000 new training places. Like Labor, it has pledged to support aged care workers in their bid for higher pay, but has stopped short of committing to fund the pay rise. The Coalition is also delivering bonuses of up to $800 for aged care staff and is spending $345m to embed pharmacy services in aged care facilities. The Coalition has already broken a 2019 promise to establish a federal anti-corruption commission. The model it proposed was widely condemned as weak, toothless and an effective shield for politicians. It allows no public hearings for government corruption, cannot take public tip-offs, has a widely criticised definition of corruption, is not retrospective, and cannot make findings of corruption. It requires suspicion that a criminal offence has occurred before commencing an investigation, a threshold which critics say is hugely prohibitive. The Coalition released an exposure draft but never tabled its legislation in parliament, blaming a lack of support from Labor. Labor, meanwhile, has promised to establish an integrity commission by the end of the year. It has not released a detailed blueprint of how its model would work, but its two-page statement of principles indicates it would have the “independence, resources and powers of a standing royal commission”. Labor’s model would be able to hold public hearings, take public tip-offs, investigate MPs and ministers with broad discretion, act retrospectively, and make findings of corruption. The Coalition’s childcare policy leans primarily on past action. In the 2021 budget, the government increased the subsidy for the second and subsequent children in care, and removed the annual cap that limited the subsidy a family earning over $190,000 could receive. These restrictions had acted as a disincentive for many women to return to work. The changes took effect in March this year. Analysts say the changes reduce, but don’t remove, those workforce disincentives. Labor’s policy goes further, increasing the maximum subsidies for the first and subsequent children in care and softening the income taper so households can earn more while receiving higher subsidies. The party also pledges to get the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to work out a way to regulate childcare prices, and the Productivity Commission to review the sector “with the aim of implementing a universal 90% subsidy for all families”. According to Grattan Institute analysis, the high cost to the commonwealth for the Labor scheme would likely be more than offset by the broadly increased workforce participation. Despite significant pressure, the Coalition has not increased the 2030 emissions reduction target (26-28% compared with 2005 levels) it set in 2015. It opposes requiring anyone to cut emissions. Instead, it says it will spend $22bn on low-emissions technology by 2030, focusing on six priority areas. More than half this funding just tops up the budgets of existing clean energy agencies. Budget papers suggested the annual allocation of climate spending is expected to decrease over the next four years and the $22bn includes support for gas, a fossil fuel. The Coalition has promised to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but the plan does not explain how the goal will be reached. It assumes new technology will become commercial at some point after 2030 and be adopted. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor has a 2030 plan and a more ambitious emissions target for that date – a 43% cut. Scientists say it is significantly better than the Coalition, but less than what is needed. The ALP says it would create a $20bn “rewiring the nation corporation” to accelerate the roll out of major transmission links – poles and wires, in simple terms – to connect new solar and wind farms and batteries to the grid. Its modelling suggests 82% of grid electricity would be from renewables by 2030. It is promising to work with industry to gradually reduce its emissions using an existing Coalition policy known as the safeguard mechanism. It says it would exempt electric vehicles from some taxes, spend more on EV charging stations than the Coalition and attempt to help build global action by bidding to co-host the annual UN climate summit with Pacific countries in 2024. Both parties would allow fossil fuel exports to continue while there is a market for Australian coal and gas. The Coalition left it until late in the campaign to drop its main housing policy, which appears to offer one of the bigger differences with Labor. Buyers would be able to tap their superannuation for as much as $50,000, or 40%, to assist with the purchase of a first home, provided they later repay their retirement fund. Over-55s would also be able to access a scheme now open to 65s-plus to tip as much as $600,000 into their super to encourage downsizing and add market supply.Critics, though, note younger buyers typically have little super and extra demand would nudge prices higher. Few people had taken up the downsizing plan that’s been in place since 2018. By contrast, Labor’s schemes are means-tested and include the “help to buy” plan that would see the government chip in as much as 40% of the price for a new home (30% for existing ones) for buyers with at least a 2% deposit. To the extent it pushes up prices, the policy has a sting, but with the program capped at 10,000 a year (compared with about 100,000 first homers entering the market) the issue may be its limited scope. A separate plan to create a $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund sounds grand but the 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties over five years is also modest. Senior Coalition MPs, including the prime minister, have said they do not support the key reform proposed in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which is to enshrine a voice to parliament in the constitution. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, has been attempting to develop a consensus position that could be progressed toward referendum, but any deviation from enshrining a voice has been roundly criticised by those supportive of the Uluru statement. He’s also attempted to progress a version of the voice under ordinary legislation, which has also been criticised as not conforming to the central demands of the Uluru dialogues. There are some outliers within the party. Labor has committed to implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full, including progressing a referendum to enshrine a voice to parliament in the constitution. It has also committed to establishing a Makarrata Commission, which it says will develop a national framework for treaty-making and support and fund local truth-telling efforts, in partnership with First Nations groups and local communities. There isn’t a lot of detail around this model but it may look to Victoria’s Yoorrook Justice Commission. Few significant reforms to health have been announced by either of the major parties, despite rising out-of-pocket health costs and pressure on emergency services and hospitals. Anthony Albanese has said he is prepared to sit down and work “constructively” with state premiers on the need for more hospital funding, but has ruled out making any grand funding promises before the election. Labor will fund 50 bulk-billed urgent care clinics, but some experts say this is too few and a short-term fix to a struggling health system. Ahead of the final week of the election campaign, Labor revealed the most significant health commitment made by either party to date; promising a $970m investment in primary health and a boost for infrastructure upgrades in GP practices. The Coalition announced a package to boost regional, rural and remote health, since matched by the opposition. Both parties will reduce the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme co-payment to bring down the cost of medicines. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president, Dr Karen Price, said until the opposition’s announcement, “we had not seen a commitment by either major party to meaningfully invest in general practice patient care”. But she said the Medicare rebate issue was still pressing. The health economist Prof Stephen Duckett said the health election policies of both parties had failed to mention “the elephant in the room – the continuing Covid pandemic”, saying funding for the pandemic’s ongoing impact was lacking.",News/Australia news,From housing to a federal Icac: seven key issues where Labor and the Coalition differ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/from-housing-to-a-federal-icac-seven-key-issues-where-labor-and-the-coalition-differ
5/19/2022,"Queensland forests are being cleared at almost twice the rate reflected in national greenhouse gas emissions, new analysis suggests, prompting questions about the climate data that Australia reports to the United Nations. The study of data from Queensland’s statewide landcover and tree study (Slats) shows 455,756 hectares of forests were cleared across the state in 2018-19. It is at odds with the amount of deforestation recorded under the national carbon accounting system that informs greenhouse gas emissions accounts. The national system found on average 245,767 hectares were cleared each year across 2018 and 2019. Martin Taylor, a former conservation scientist with WWF Australia and now an adjunct senior lecturer at the University of Queensland, said it reinforced earlier claims that national deforestation emissions were likely to be higher than what the country had reported at international climate negotiations. “There’s been this glaring disconnect between Queensland and national data for so long,” he said. The difference matters because changes in land clearing have played a central role in allowing Australia to say it is meeting climate targets. According to national greenhouse accounts, there has been a dramatic reduction in emissions from land clearing and forestry since 2005, largely due to a reduction in forest destruction in Queensland after changes in state laws. It allowed the Morrison government to claim a 19.6% cut in national emissions since that year. In reality, little of this drop has been the result to steps taken by the federal Coalition. If land clearing and forestry are excluded, national emissions are down less than 2% since 2005. If the national data for land clearing and forestry emissions are incorrect, as the analysis suggests, it would mean the government could claim only a much smaller emissions cut over the past 16 years. It would make it less likely Australia was on track to meet the Coalition’s target of a 26-28% cut in emissions by 2030. The national and Queensland accounts differ in part because the federal data only counts clearing of forest to bare ground while the state data records all clearing, including of sparse woodland and even when the plant growth was only partly cleared. Taylor aligned the two systems by filtering the Queensland data to match the national definition of primary deforestation and re-clearing of secondary forests. His analysis did not attempt to estimate the resulting emissions from the clearing. Taylor said the discrepancy appeared to be due largely to errors in woody cover mapping in the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The level of agreement between the two systems was “surprisingly and shockingly low”, he said. Unlike Slats, the national estimates are not used for any compliance issues where accuracy can be critical in court cases. Queensland officials will often visit sites in person to compare the satellite imagery – generated down to just 30cm, fine enough to detect individual trees – with what they can verify on the ground.Taylor said that federal officials were “only interested in coming out with a number for the nation”. “As far as they’re concerned, it’s good enough for that,” he said. A spokesperson for the federal energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, rejected the Queensland findings, and said Australia’s emissions reporting was prepared by officials in accordance with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] guidelines. “Any suggestion that the inventory has underreported emissions from land clearing is incorrect and wrong,” the spokesperson said. “The methods and data used are reviewed each year by a team of international experts assembled by the UNFCCC.” The government spokesperson said a comparison of land-clearing rates between 1990 and 2018 showed the national database picked up 9% more clearing than the Queensland data. Martin Taylor disputed this. He said the government comparison compared clearing of any woody vegetation, including sparse shrubs, while his report looked at forests. He said it showed the national data picked up much less deforestation than the Queensland data. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Queensland government delayed the release of the 2018-19 data so it could access improved imagery, including from a European satellite system. Queensland’s environment minister, Meaghan Scanlon, declined to comment on the dispute but said accurate information was “vital to making sure you can make informed decisions”. “That’s why our world-leading scientists have helped develop Slats, updated our methodology and have used the most current technology to make sure we’re accurately tracking vegetation in Queensland,” Scanlon said. Federal Labor was asked for its response to the Queensland data. It highlighted previous comments by Chris Bowen, the party’s climate change spokesperson, about an ALP promise to review the integrity of Australian carbon credits – some of which are generated by restoring vegetation and protecting existing forests – if the party wins office.

At some point it’s going to come back to bite us.”  Imagery supplied by the Planet Application Program Interface: In Space for Life on Earth, that can be sourced from https://api.planet.com.",News/Australia news,Australia’s climate data to UN questioned as study finds land clearing in Queensland underreported,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/australias-climate-data-to-un-questioned-as-study-finds-land-clearing-in-queensland-underreported
5/19/2022,"Public health researchers who were instrumental in solariums being banned in Australia are now helping to fight for a ban in the UK to reduce the number of skin cancer cases. Associate Prof Louisa Gordon, a health economist at the QIMR Berghofer medical research institute, influenced state, territory and federal governments in Australia to regulate and eventually ban tanning beds from 2016. Research from Gordon and her colleagues found that 281 melanomas, 43 deaths and 2,572 squamous cell carcinomas were attributable to solarium use in Australia each year, at a cost to the health system of around AU$3m. It is estimated that the ban led to 31,009 melanomas being averted in young Australians over their remaining lives. Despite the risks of solariums being now well established, other countries have been slower to ban or regulate them. Frustrated by this lack of progress, Dr Martin Eden, from the University of Manchester in England, spent several months in Australia working with Gordon and her colleagues to understand how they assessed the costs and harms associated with solarium use in Australia. They then applied that modelling to England, tracking the projected impact of a solarium ban on the more than 600,000 18-year-olds living there. Their research, which has just been published in the British Journal of Dermatology, found a ban on indoor tanning would result in 1,206 fewer cases of melanoma and 207 fewer melanoma deaths over their lifetimes. It would save the National Health Service £700,000, the study found. A solarium ban would also result in 3,987 fewer cases of other more common types of skin cancer, squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas, the research found. “We had all of the evidence, the calculations and strategies that we used while making the model to inform the health and economic case for a ban in Australia,” Gordon said. “We handed that over to our colleagues in England and said: ‘Why don’t you adapt this to the UK situation?’ “So we did a lot of the bulk of the early work in Australia, and now they [Eden and his team] have improved that model and updated it to make their case.” The sun bed industry was in its infancy in Australia when the calls for a ban began. But in England , “the industry is established and profitable, so the challenge there is even greater now than what Australia faced,” Gordon said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In England, sun bed use is especially high in the north-west and in cities with greater social deprivation. Its popularity is thought to partly explain the unusually high rates of melanoma among young women living in the north-west. It is also estimated there are about 62,000 children under 18 currently using sunbeds in England. Sun beds give off ultraviolet radiation that can damage the skin and eyes and, Gordon said, increases the risk of having a melanoma by almost 60%. Prof Adele Green from the University of Manchester said despite sun beds leading to deaths, “policymakers require robust economic evidence to inform decisions about a possible ban of such devices to mitigate these burdens”. “We feel we have succeeded in providing that evidence.” The chief executive at Melanoma Focus, Susanna Daniels, said the rates of melanoma skin cancer are increasing in the UK, yet 86% of cases are preventable. “We strongly advise the avoidance of sun beds,” she said.",News/Society,"Ban on solariums in England would save hundreds of lives from skin cancer, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/19/ban-on-solariums-in-england-would-save-hundreds-of-lives-from-skin-cancer-study-finds
5/19/2022,"Homeowners at risk of flooding could receive $20,000 to help raise their houses under a $7.8bn plan released by the Greens which has been welcomed by some in the building and insurance industries. The Greens say the flood adaptation scheme would mainly support homeowners in south-east Queensland and the NSW northern rivers who have been hit by multiple floods over recent months. The Greens candidate for Ryan, Elizabeth Watson-Brown, made the announcement on Wednesday alongside Senator Larissa Waters in the flood-affected seat in Brisbane’s north-west. The minor party is hopeful it could take Ryan from the Liberal National party this weekend. The Greens are also bullish about their chances in the neighbouring riverside seats of Brisbane and Griffith. Watson-Brown said the Greens had undertaken the largest door-knocking campaign in the party’s history over the past year in Griffith and its second-largest in Ryan. It wanted to hear “what people are actually concerned about”, she said. Even before February’s floods, Watson-Brown said the climate crisis was “absolutely front of mind” for voters in her leafy electorate. “People have been devastated again this year by flooding, and that is going to happen more and more often into the future with climate change,” she said. “It is serious, it is here and it’s in lots of people’s back yards.” The Greens say independent Parliamentary Budget Office costing of the house-raising plan assumes 48,000 homeowners would take up the grant each year for 10 years. Homeowners would be required to match the grant from their own pockets, meaning the party does not expect all would apply for the full $20,000. Watson-Brown, a practising architect, was a first-year student at the University of Queensland during the 1974 floods. “One of our first projects was to go around and look at flood damage right across Brisbane,” she said. “Part of my politicisation was witnessing the personal devastation that occurs with these floods.” So how much will it cost homeowners to lift their houses? Brisbane House Raising and Restumping’s Luke Macdonald said it was a question he was asked “about 500 times a year”. Macdonald said his phone had been running hot from people in Lismore and Murwillumbah seeking quotes, but he is only licensed to operate in Queensland. His small business raises houses and puts in the support beams and posts to hold them in place. He says an average quote is about $30,000, although prices vary widely depending on factors like house size and topography. Macdonald said he had recently quoted $50,000 to raise and restump a 90 sq metre Queenslander. “But we also absolutely quote homes for less than $20,000, if they are small houses and the engineering is simple,” he said. Homeowners also require engineering reports and design plans, documents which could collectively amount to about $10,000. Once their house is lifted, most owners opt for a concrete slab underneath. They also require water and electricity to be reconnected and stairs rebuilt, all of which could cost tens of thousands of dollars more. Another Brisbane house raising company puts the average cost of the whole process, from planning to reconnecting services, at between $80,000 and $120,000. Still, Macdonald said policies like that announced by the Greens could be enough to “inspire” those who were already considering raising their homes to take the next step. “If someone gives you $20,000, that’d be a pretty good incentive,” he said. “It’d be nice if they did it.” The Insurance Council of Australia said it welcomed policies that “increase community resilience to worsening extreme weather events, including investing in better protecting homes against flood”. A council spokesperson said it was calling on the next federal government to invest $413m to better protect homes against flood by “raising utilities and services above the expected flood line”.",News/Australia news,Greens say federal government should help pay for cost of raising homes in flood-prone regions,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/greens-say-federal-government-should-help-pay-for-cost-of-raising-homes-in-flood-prone-regions
5/19/2022,"It’s been a marathon campaign but the finish line is in sight. Unless Saturday night’s result is too close to call, Australians will know in a few days whether Scott Morrison is returning for three more years or whether Anthony Albanese will be the country’s next prime minister. Over the past couple of months Guardian Australia reporters have fanned out in marginal seats across the country to try to capture the mood and dynamics of the 2022 election from the ground up. The result of this exercise has been the illuminating Anywhere But Canberra series. Before sharing what we’ve learned, let’s set the scene. Australia has some parallels with the United States. Our political sensibilities are shaped by geography. Australians are more conservative in the resource-rich states in the north and the west, and more progressive and post-material in the south. Voter priorities in inner-city seats can be different to those in the regions and outer suburbs. A realignment has been playing out over several election cycles as voters rust off from the major parties and seek representation outside the Coalition and Labor. According to the Australian National University’s Australian election survey, which has assessed electoral trends since 1987, partisanship for the two major political parties reached its lowest level on record during the 2019 election. The proportion of Australian voters who no longer align with a political party reached a record high of 21%. In 2022 the focal point of that long-term electoral realignment has been the rise of teal independents in city contests. There has also been significant discussion during this election about whether or not Morrison is executing a version of Boris Johnson’s “red wall” strategy – parting company with centre-right progressives in the city and flipping Labor territory in the regions and outer suburbs. While we are less partisan, it feels as though polarisation has increased. The constant culture warring in Canberra sometimes creates the impression that polarisation is now so entrenched that Australians in different parts of the country have irreconcilable interests. But the striking thing about our swing through marginal seats in 2022 is how consistent voter sentiment was in every part of the country. The message from voters was similar everywhere we went, from the suburbs of Perth, to Tasmania’s north-west, to regional Queensland. Reporting this series told us many Australians are deeply irritated with Morrison. Some of this voter blowback is visceral. Patience Stewart, whom I met in Launceston in the ultra-marginal seat of Bass, said the prime minister needed to be “buried” in this contest. “I have no time for him,” she said. “He’s reactive, there’s no forward thinking, I find him very difficult to watch now. I turn the television off when he’s on because I don’t have any faith in what he says.” But many voters remain on the fence about Albanese, mainly because they don’t have a clear sense of who he is. In the Sydney seat of Reid, reporter Michael McGowan met Shelley Tan, a nurse. Tan said she’ll vote Labor because workers need a pay rise. But this is a passive decision rather than an active one. “[Albanese] is not the greatest but I’ve got no other choice, do I? I don’t want to vote for Scott Morrison.” In Boothby in suburban Adelaide, Sarah Martin met 73-year-old retired teacher Helen Martin. Martin voted for Morrison in the miracle election of 2019 but she’s not sure she can back him on Saturday. But she’s not in Albanese’s column yet either. “They both have as much personality as earthworms,” she said. “Neither comes across as being able to make hard decisions [and] they are basing their election campaigns on dirty politics and populist voting.” In the seat of Hunter in New South Wales, Josh Butler met Di and Graeme at Lake Macquarie. Graeme, a lifetime Labor man, wants Albanese in the top job; Di, normally a Liberal voter, didn’t have kind words for Morrison or the Labor leader. Morrison, Di said, was “a dickhead”. “But I’m disappointed in [Albanese] ... For the traditional Labor voters, I think he’s fine. But for people like me, I’m looking for someone that’s got a little bit more oomph to him.” This major-party disaffection was summarised most evocatively by Burnie-resident Brad Lucas in the seat of Braddon. He characterised the two major parties and their leaders as “two cheeks, same arsehole”. Florence , a real estate agent in St Marys in the western Sydney seat of Lindsay, expressed ennui more poetically. She told reporter Mostafa Rachwani: “People feel depressed, they feel sad and lost – they don’t feel supported by anyone.” Depending on where they are in the country, voters are looking at the teals, Clive Palmer and One Nation. In north-west Tasmania, every voter we spoke to knew Jacqui Lambie and had a favourable impression of her. In the Victorian seat of Goldstein, reporter Benita Kolovos met Bill and Jenny Raper who are voting for the teal independent Zoe Daniel. Jenny Raper said: “We’ve lived here 62 years. We’ve never really had a true representative, it’s true-blue Liberal so they’ve always been either ministers or men on the rise into the ministry and so, honestly, they’re absent.” Reporter Joe Hinchliffe met Bruce Pryde in the Queensland seat of Longman. Pryde plans to lodge a coronavirus “protest vote” against what he describes as “the big three”: the Liberals, Labor and Greens. He’ll vote for One Nation or the Palmer United party. Hinchliffe also met Sharni Kate who quit her job as an early childhood teacher and took up dog grooming rather than receive a vaccine. She’s drawn to Palmer. While we struggled to find many voters enthusiastic about Morrison, some people believe he has done his best in trying circumstances. In Bondi in the seat of Wentworth, Josh Butler met Clare Murray, a lifelong Labor voter, who said Morrison had done “a difficult job in very difficult times … They’re all going to make mistakes.” While Albanese’s main problem is that voters don’t know enough about him, those who do approve of his values. Retiree Jenny King in Goldstein, a lifelong Liberal voter, said of the Labor leader: “He’s a very nice person, he’s a lovely person … But I just don’t think he’s leadership material.” The Anywhere But Canberra series kicked off in late April in the seat of Gilmore, in the pub where Morrison developed his concept of the “quiet Australians” back in 2019. On the south coast of NSW, Sarah Martin met Grant McLaurin and Colin Mullholland and witnessed an exchange playing out across the country as people prepare to cast their ballots. McLaurin: “Morrison? Oh, shit yeah. He is in big trouble. Let me put it this way – Labor is not putting up anything against him and I still think he is in trouble.” Mullholland: “I don’t think he should be. It’s a very hard job ScoMo has got. He’s walked in at a bloody bad time: bushfires, Covid, two floods.” The Anywhere But Canberra project is anecdotal not scientific. Published opinion polls, if we believe them, suggest Labor is likely to win on Saturday night, although the contest seems to be tightening. Our voter feedback feels more line ball. Based on the sentiment we’ve collected, Morrison could lose this election, but it feels equally possible that Albanese could struggle to win it. In any case, a six-week campaign has tried the patience of the nation. In the Victorian electorate of Chisholm, we met friends Emma and Lorraine. They reported suffering from election fatigue. “It is too long,” Lorraine said, and Emma finished: “It gets a bit childish, this snapping at each other.”",News/Australia news,"For the 2022 election, we took the temperature of Australia’s marginal seats.

5/19/2022,"Less than a week before the federal election, the assistant minister for women, Amanda Stoker, sat down for a video interview with Warwick Marsh, a conservative Christian and men’s rights activist. Marsh was sacked as a federal government men’s health ambassador in 2008 after he refused to distance himself from some of the claims in a report he co-authored that claimed “homosexuality is a mental disorder”. He has denied being homophobic and said previously there is a “war on men” and that the gender pay gap is “a myth”. Stoker spoke about her campaign to return to the Senate, having been bumped to third on the Liberal National party’s ticket in Queensland, leaving her in serious danger of not returning to the federal parliament. “Warwick, thank you for your friendship all throughout my opportunity to serve,” she said. The video of the interview has been watched about 400 times on Facebook – even fewer on YouTube. Such marginal viewership might lead voters to wonder why Stoker would court controversy – and waste 20 minutes of her time – speaking to Marsh. But it is typical of the way Stoker is fighting to retain her seat, narrowcasting to rightwing Christian causes and voters flirting with fringe parties, in a campaign that puts her (from the No 3 spot on the ticket) front and centre of view. Stoker has spent more than $60,000 on Facebook advertising in the weeks before election day – vastly outspending most other Senate candidates. Many of her posts are targeted directly at the news feeds of older people, particularly older women. One of those was a spend of between $3,500 and $4,000 to promote a Facebook post from 5 May, which showed her speaking at an anti-abortion rally in Brisbane. The group that hosted the rally, Cherish Life, was last week accused by a Labor MP of running a “disgusting smear campaign”, which claimed Labor wants to enact an “extreme abortion agenda”, something the party denies. Cherish Life has said it stands by the campaign and has released its own how-to-vote cards urging its supporters to vote for Stoker and other anti-abortion candidates below the line. The Australian Christian Lobby, in an interview with Stoker, also urged people of faith to vote below the line. Queensland’s Senate race is hotly contested this year, with the Greens, Clive Palmer, One Nation and the former premier Campbell Newman all seeking to challenge the major parties for the six spots. Dr Glenn Kefford, a political scientist at the University of Queensland, says the LNP will almost certainly win two Senate seats meaning James McGrath and Matt Canavan, who are in the top spots on the ticket, will be elected. Kefford says Stoker’s strategy of speaking directly to rightwing Christian voters would be a deliberate attempt to encourage them to vote for her below the line on the Senate ballot paper. “Unless she’s running a completely rogue campaign, which is unlikely, she’d have been given a tick off to run a differentiated strategy from the rest of the ticket, to really harvest the vote of the Christian right in Queensland,” Kefford said. Kefford said the strategy was similar to the one employed by the Tasmanian senator Eric Abetz, who finds himself at risk and is encouraging people to vote for him below the line. “That’s really the strategy … similar to what Abetz has done, to persuade voters that she has a political niche and to vote for her below the line. “It does set her apart from the other LNP candidates. We know that there’s a real strengthening within the LNP of the Christian right and it’s an attempt to narrowcast to that base … to differentiate herself from the rest of the ticket.” During the election campaign Stoker has been interviewed online by the Australian Christian Lobby and appeared at the group’s Gold Coast politics forum, where she was introduced as a “legend”. In recent months she has published paid social media advertisements saying she supports “conservative, family values” and spoken at a Sunday service at one of Brisbane’s biggest evangelical churches, Gateway. Stoker has spent more than $20,000 on her most recent advertisement on Facebook, seeking to link Labor to the Greens in a bid to bring rightwing voters flirting with minor parties back into the tent. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “If they channel that support into the LNP, to get me up as the third in Queensland, they’ll have a fighter for their values … in the room,” she said. In her interview with Marsh, Stoker made what appeared to be a veiled dig at McGrath, who beat her for top spot on the ticket in a tense preselection that underscored tensions in the LNP between so-called moderates and a growing faction of “Christian soldiers”. “Ultimately, you know, politics is a numbers game,” Stoker said. “This is true of anywhere in life. You succeed in the places where you invest your efforts. I invested my efforts in doing the hard policy work of the government rather than counting numbers. “It’s deepened my faith, my trust in God … I’m really comfortable with where I am because I know that if I can deliver this then I’m moving the dial in a way that I wouldn’t have in a safe spot.” Stoker did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia about her campaign.",News/Australia news,Amanda Stoker targets Christian right in hopes of retaining Queensland senate seat,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/amanda-stoker-targets-christian-right-in-hopes-of-retaining-queensland-senate-seat
5/19/2022,"Australia’s tropical rainforest trees have being dying at double the previous rate since the 1980s, seemingly because of global heating, according to new research that raises concerns tropical forests could start to release more carbon dioxide than they absorb. The study, published in the journal Nature, found the average life of tropical trees in north Queensland had been reduced by about half over the past 35 years . The finding was consistent across different species and rainforests. Scientists said it indicated natural systems such as rainforests may have already been responding to the climate crisis for decades, and suggested other tropical forests across the globe may be experiencing a similar rise in death rate. David Bauman, a tropical forest ecologist at the University of Oxford and and the study’s lead author, said it was a shock to detect such a marked increase in tree mortality. Oxford professor Yadvinder Malhi, a study co-author, compared the changes in Australia’s rainforests to those in corals in the Great Barrier Reef, which have suffered four mass bleaching events over the past seven years. “The likely driving factor we identify – the increasing drying power of the atmosphere caused by global warming – suggests similar increases in tree death rates may be occurring across the world’s tropical forests,” he said. “If that is the case, tropical forests may soon become carbon sources, and the challenge of limiting global warming well below 2C becomes both more urgent and more difficult.” The study examined data from more than 8,300 trees in 24 north Queensland forests. Much of the data came from a CSIRO lab in Atherton. The lab is focused on tropical forest research and is closing down. Prof Susan Laurance, a tropical ecology expert at James Cook University and a co-author of the study, said the CSIRO had been monitoring tree plots used for the study since 1971. “The beauty of this research is that it’s one of a few long-term studies and it’s so hard to get funding to do that,” she said. “It’s a little bit sad because CSIRO was probably the only organisation in the country that was funded long-term to be able to do [that research].” Russell Barrett, a senior research scientist at the Australian Institute of Botanical Science, said the findings of the study were significant, and should serve as a climate warning “as clear and stark as mass coral bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef”. “It is just much harder to see and document,” he said. He said it could cause a re-think of the potential for forests to store carbon. “A doubling of tree death risk dramatically changes our calculations for the quantity of carbon stored in our forests, and how long it is likely to stay there” he said. A study in 2020 found tropical forests were taking less carbon from the atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of an accelerated climate breakdown. It pointed to the need to cut carbon-producing activities faster to counteract the loss of carbon sinks. Barrett said while the study focussed on tropical forests in North Queensland, the drying atmosphere affected all Australian plant communities. It highlighted the need for more studies in a range of habitats, he said. “This need is especially great for plant communities that are already at the edge of their climatic windows, such as alpine vegetation and wet rainforests,” he said. Laurence said she would seek funding from the Australian Research Council to continue the research. She hoped to analyse the age of the trees affected and the implications for the ecosystem. She said if old-growth tropical trees were the most at risk it could affect rainfall patterns.",News/Environment,Australia’s tropical rainforests have been dying faster for decades in ‘clear and stark climate warning’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/19/australias-tropical-rainforests-have-been-dying-faster-for-decades-in-clear-and-stark-climate-warning
5/19/2022,"Labor has promised to “move quickly” on a referendum to constitutionally enshrine an Indigenous voice to parliament in the first term of government if elected on Saturday. As the polls tighten in the final days of the election campaign, Labor has released its $680m-plus Indigenous affairs policy, focused on health, housing and justice issues, while accusing the Coalition of “ignoring the needs” of First Nations people and voters. Labor’s shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, said the prime minister Scott Morrison’s “casual dismissal” of a referendum on a voice to parliament has been “hurtful and exhausting” for First Nations people, and has accused the Coalition of showing no interest in bringing the country together. “Those who support the Uluru Statement face a clear choice at this election,” Burney said. “Morrison has shown nothing but disinterest in bringing the country together around these proposals. His casual dismissal of a referendum on a Voice to Parliament is hurtful and exhausting. “Australians are more than ready for the discussion about a Voice to Parliament. We are already having it. It’s time we put the discussion at the centre of our national discourse and took it to a vote. Early in the campaign, Morrison said it was not his government’s policy to hold a referendum, adding: “So why would I be doing that?” He again faced criticism on Tuesday for not sending a representative to engage in NITV’s First Nations election forum.

It pledged $100m for housing and essential services for NT homelands, and $200m worth of upgrades of “overcrowded and run-down” remote housing in Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and the NT. “What’s needed is political leadership,” WA Labor senator Pat Dodson said. “From Whitlam returning Gurindji land to Vincent Lingiari, to Keating’s Redfern Speech and Rudd’s Apology, Labor has shown it is ready to walk with First Nations people and all Australians towards a fairer, more just future.” Labor also promised $79m for justice reinvestment to “turn the tide” on incarceration and deaths in custody, and says it will boost funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services. And it has committed to 500 new frontline workers to support women in crisis and tackling family violence, and will abolish the “punitive” work for the dole scheme. “We will abolish the punitive Community Development Program and replace it with a program with real jobs, proper wages and decent conditions. And we will abolish the discriminatory Cashless Debit Card,” the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said in a statement.

5/19/2022,"Going home can feel like jumping into the ring: all defensive stance and fists up, ready to fight the ghosts of the past to preserve the person you have become. In Dubbo Championship Wrestling, this feeling is all too real for Rose, the unhappy heir to her father Des’s cheesy, low-budget, late-night wrestling event. This Hayes Theatre Company musical begins in a flashback to 1985, where Des (Terry Serio) and wife Cheryl (Bishanyia Vincent) are the reigning king and queen of the ring, Cheryl proudly showing off her baby bump. We then rocket forward to 2003: baby Rose (Zoe Ioannou, in a roaring performance) is now an angry teen, having left Dubbo with her mother to live in Sydney for the last 10 years. Rose looks down on her home town but after having suplexed her PE teacher in a fit of pique, she’s back in Dubbo with her mum for her probation. While they’re there, Cheryl wants to take down DCW, Des, and the town that stole the “best years of [her] life” – that is, if Dubbo’s bucolic charm and her father’s world of sequins and knee pads doesn’t win Rose over first. Don’t expect these motivations to be so easily spelled out onstage, however. The book of this musical, by first-time writer Daniel Cullen, has a tendency to hurry over establishing motivations and character arcs in favour of choreographed wrestling setpieces (lovingly written and handled) and an extensive catalogue of bogan-poking jokes (some are fantastic). It’s a shame that the balance is off, because it affects the overall tone: jokes land a little meaner than they should, and the second act, which needs to chart some real changes of heart, doesn’t quite land. Cullen, who also wrote the music with his brother James, could have lifted a trick from wrestling: focusing tightly on the face (hero) and heel (villain) of the story. The face here is Rose: it’s her personal growth and eventual save-the-town triumph we’re rooting for. But we learn about her past so late in the show that, for much of it, she and we are floundering without a foundation. And then there’s the heel: Cheryl. It’s near impossible to take your eyes off Vincent as she reveals her manipulative depths and stop-at-nothing attitude to destroy the local wrestling scene, ominous evil laughter and all. But because we learn so late in the show, again, what happened when she left Dubbo, we don’t know whether to root for Cheryl or just delight in her campy villainy. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The real emotional centre of Dubbo Championship Wrestling is the family patriarch, Des. We hear a lot about his wrestling dreams, and we watch him try to keep them alive. He’s a fully rounded character who is awarded both jokes and critical dignity. But all this development for Des – and not his daughter and ex-wife – throws off the whole show, which turns on Rose and Cheryl’s actions. Still, some moments soar. The show’s director, Sheridan Harbridge (one of the sharpest comic minds in Australian musical theatre) puts the laughs first in a show that needs its audience to cackle to keep it afloat. The action all takes place inside Ella Butler’s wrestling-ring set, which adds a fresh dynamism. And of course a show about wrestling needs some smackdowns. The show’s choreographer, Ellen Simpson, and its fight director, Tim Dashwood, have created broad, bold shapes that are, in key moments, genuinely surprising. Even the most hard-hearted will find it difficult not to clap when Rose and Dubbo local Ron (Luke Leong-Tay, lovely as a romantic lead) fall for each other in the ring. While Ron’s wrestling story is the most interesting – he’s tired of being cast in the outdated wrestling world role of “villainous foreigner” – it’s Aaron Tsindos as Ken, a peacocking American who believes wrestling is all real, who all but walks away with the show with his oversized ego and lovable stupidity. Mickie (Genevieve Lemon) and Trish (Noni McCallum) are fantastic comic relief as the “tradie ladies” wrestling duo. Then there’s the music. The Cullens have written a tribute to Oz Rock, largely 80s-inflected pub sounds filtered through musical theatre melodies, which sounds full and assured played by the show’s small band under the direction and supervision of Glenn Moorhouse and Joe Accaria, who co-arranged the numbers. Dubbo Championship Wrestling would benefit from thoughtful revisions and character-focused dramaturgy if it is to have a longer and better life. But its strongest numbers make it a show with exciting potential.

5/19/2022,"You’ve heard of inflation but what about “shrinkflation”? Shrinkflation is a term coined by economists more than seven years ago but the process is becoming an increasingly common response to inflationary pressures. Popular food brands are quietly reducing the size of their products sold in Australian supermarkets without decreasing prices accordingly, new research has found. Data released by consumer advocacy group Choice shows companies including Nestle, Kellogg’s and Cadbury have shrunk their product sizes while charging the same price or more for the items. Less is more at Cadbury, with its new chocolate block range, More, branded a case of shrinkflation by the consumer group. The 165 gram blocks, which come in a variety of nuts, fruit and salted toffee flavours, have been retailing at major supermarkets for $5, the same price as Cadbury’s regular 180 gram Dairy Milk blocks. A spokesperson for Cadbury owner Mondelez said the More blocks featured a new shape with extra ingredients and a “chunkier” eating experience – making them more expensive to produce. “The new More range is a fresh, indulgent take on some familiar favourites,” they said. “The blocks feature a … chunkier eat experience, hence the different size. The new range also includes more inclusions, such as nuts and fruit pieces, than our original … blocks.” The Choice journalist Liam Kennedy said there had been community tip-offs that “the heft” of products had shrunk while prices had increased, sparking its investigation. “Overhead costs are increasing … there’s been classic inflationary pressures that have put the squeeze on manufacturers and brands,” he said. “The issue does seem to be coming to the fore.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Major cereal brand Kelloggs has also been accused of shrinkflation. Since 2019, the company had moved from selling 670 gram Crunchy Nut boxes for $6 to selling 640 gram boxes at $9 a pop, Choice found. Kennedy said consumers had gone from paying $0.90 per 100 grams of cereal to $1.41 – a 57% increase. Froot Loops had also downsized from 500 gram boxes to 460 gram packages while selling around the same price of $9. Gary Mortimer, a professor of marketing and consumer behaviour at the Queensland University of Technology, had conducted experiments into the “shrinkflation effect” on shoppers and said it was “surprising” to see a package size reduction alongside a retail price increase. “Putting prices up is always risky as a brand … [but] shrinkflation is rarely noticed in the marketplace,” he said. Mortimer’s research found shoppers “don’t like price increases at all” but were more accepting of reductions in package sizing. “Shoppers prefer shrinkflation over inflation,” he said. “They’re sensitive to price not contents.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Even more palatable was a perceived discount. Mortimer’s research found a 38% increase in sales when product size was reduced along with prices. “Customers felt they were getting a bargain because the price went down,” Mortimer said. Mortimer said while shrinkflation was not a new concept, manufacturers would be looking at it as “the only strategy” to keep costs down in a volatile climate. “As we’re becoming more sensitive to food price and inflation, most consumers would rather pay the same for their grocery bill,” he said. “When brands implement a content reduction strategy most customers don’t notice they’re getting 25 or 30 grams less.” Pet food label Purina One, owned by Nestle, said it had been forced to shrink the size of its products to keep them affordable. The brand has been spruiking its updated range of dry adult cat food products, featuring a “new and improved recipe” to bolster immune systems and improve feline health. But most new versions of the product were no longer available in the standard 1.5kg packaging the original came in – it was now sold in 1.4kg bags at an increased price. A spokesperson for Nestle said the company had been facing “significant increases” in the cost of raw materials, packaging and transport which accounted for the price rises and changes in packaging sizes. In the past, owners shopping for their feline friends would have nabbed the 1.5kg originals at a recommended retail price of $15.45. But the smaller products were now selling for $16.50 at major supermarkets. A spokesperson for Nestle said over the past two years, the company had worked on an “improved formulation” for its Purina One range with all products now including a “specialty designed blend” to support the immune response of cats. Changes had also been made to kibble. “In some instances, we decreased the size of the bag, to ensure we can continue to deliver the same quality products at an affordable pack price,” they said. “For some variants we have also introduced larger bags which offer better value.” Kennedy said a surefire way to spot shrinkflation was to pay attention to the weight and size of a product, as well as the unit price per 100 grams. “You’ll start noticing if they start shrinking,” he said. “If a product undergoes simultaneous changes in size and cost, the unit price can tell you if you’re still getting the same value for money as you were before.” Kellogg’s was approached for comment.",News/Business,Shrinkflation bites: popular food brands quietly downsize while charging same price or more,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/shrinkflation-bites-popular-food-brands-quietly-downsize-while-charging-same-price-or-more
5/19/2022,"After initial hesitation about the seriousness of Turkey’s objections, its president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has doubled down on his threat to veto Finland’s and Sweden’s applications for membership of Nato, saying there is no point in either country sending delegations to Ankara to persuade him otherwise. On Wednesday, he also extended his demands from the two he outlined on Monday to 10, leading to claims that he is using blackmail. At his press conference on Monday, he made two key demands: that Finland and Sweden end their supposed support for the Kurdish Workers’ party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation, and that they lift their ban on arms exports imposed in October 2019 after the Turkish incursion in northern Syria. No one doubts that Erdoğan’s intervention could tangle Nato up in knots for months. It is now the task of alliance diplomats to establish Erdoğan’s seriousness and the price that would have to be paid to make him back down, and prevent a full-blown Nato crisis. The Swedish foreign minister, Ann Linde, initially hoped that something had got lost in translation after she had been quoted in the Turkish press saying the Turks regard all Kurds as terrorists. Linde said on Sunday she had never made these remarks, had never met the PKK, and would not do so. She was cautiously optimistic that any misunderstanding could be cleared up, but by Wednesday it was clear her reassurances were falling short of what Erdoğan requires. The Nordic political class initially appeared sceptical about Erdoğan’s seriousness. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, said he spoke with Erdoğan a month ago and none of his current concerns were aired. It was also being said that no early warning flares were sent up by Turkey’s Nato ambassador, Basat Öztürk. But that assessment is changing. Jonathan Eyal, the associate director of the Rusi thinktank, said Erdoğan “lives on the edge and operates through brinkmanship”. Eyal added: “Many of his demands about the PKK are part of a familiar Turkish tune. But he has domestic reasons to be standing up to America. The economy is in tatters and his popularity is at an all time low.” With inflation at 66.9% and facing elections next summer, there is no harm galvanising the nationalist vote, but that is not to say Erdoğan’s complaints are entirely synthetic. On Monday, the Turkish justice ministry identified six alleged PKK members it is seeking to extradite from Finland and 11 from Sweden. Add in people accused by Turkey of supporting the US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, who Ankara accuses of orchestrating the 2016 coup attempt, and Turkey wants 12 people returned from Finland and 21 from Sweden. Nordic diplomats say this list was last presented in 2017 and has not been the subject of any Turkish lobbying in recent years. Turkish media has reported what it describes as other examples of a “soft” Swedish attitude to terrorism, including evidence that the Syrian branch of the PKK has held meetings in Stockholm hosted by the Swedish foreign office and the Olof Palme International Center, a thinktank funded by Swedish trade unions. Turkey also says that in 2019 PKK supporters held a protest in a shopping centre in support of the jailed leader Abdullah Öcalan and Swedish security forces did nothing to prevent them from carrying the PKK’s “flag” and pictures of Öcalan. Eyal said it would be hard for the Nordic countries to bow to these complaints. “It is not possible for either country … to change its domestic legislation on freedom of assembly,” he said. “Sweden in particular has an active Kurdish community that has political support. This episode is reminiscent of 2009 when Erdoğan said he would not allow Anders Rasmussen to be appointed Nato’s secretary general unless Denmark closed a Kurdish TV station. Rasmussen was appointed but a year later the TV station was closed.” Some similar delayed behind-the-scenes deal could happen this time. Neither country can simply tear up its own internal asylum systems and Sweden says it does do not run independent terrorist lists different from those compiled at EU level. Eyal argues Erdoğan’s target is as likely to be the US as Finland and Sweden. Turkey’s 2017 purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile defence system turned it into a pariah in the US and led to Ankara being kicked out of the F-35 stealth fighter jet programme. The recent rumours, denied by Moscow, that Vladimir Putin might visit Ankara in the near future were probably another signal from Ankara that it has cards to play. But it is precisely this double game that leaves so many other Nato states frustrated with Erdoğan’s brinkmanship.",News/World news,Why has Erdoğan doubled down on threat to veto Nordic Nato bids?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/erdogan-doubles-down-on-threat-to-veto-nordic-nato-membership
5/19/2022,"The Home Office’s refusal to waive the £2,404 fee for the “bereaved partner concession” that grants a widow or widower indefinite leave to remain is a cruel blow on top of a tragic event (Home Office charging bereaved partners £2,400 for leave to remain in UK, 15 May). It illustrates the hardship and pain described in our new report, Destroying Hopes, Dreams and Lives, which details how the extortionate cost of all visas, and the often labyrinthine complexity of the visa application process, affects almost every aspect of the lives of hundreds of thousands of migrants in the UK. It is unconscionable that we welcome migrants because we need their skills, services and enterprise and then impose extortionate fees – amounting to five to 10 times the actual cost of a visa – that have a destructive impact on their lives.Nazek RamadanDirector, Migrant Voice  A month after a whistleblower working on the Homes for Ukraine scheme highlighted its many flaws and said it appeared to be designed to fail, the process is little improved. Seven weeks since applying for visas for a mother and her two children under the scheme, three weeks since the first two visas were successfully granted, and two weeks since the remaining application was marked for “fast-tracking” by the visa helpline, the family we are hoping to host are still waiting for the last child’s application to be decided. The odds seemed to be stacked against them. No one involved in the drafting of the application is allowed to speak to anyone in the Home Office who has access to the application forms to identify the cause for the delay. And no one on the visa helpline has any access to the applications or any visibility of the process itself. All they can recommend is to “speak to your MP”. When one’s MP has a record of consistently voting for stricter asylum rules, and a poor record of responding to emails or to messages left on his parliamentary voicemail, this doesn’t seem to bode well for the innocent child victims of war.Rachel ShawBerkhamsted, Hertfordshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
