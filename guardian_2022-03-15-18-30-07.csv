3/15/2022,"Europe’s captain for the 2023 Ryder Cup will be confirmed on Tuesday afternoon, with intrigue centring around whether Henrik Stenson has given sufficient assurances regarding the rebuffal of the Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway tour to beat Luke Donald to the post. As The Guardian reported in December, Stenson and Donald have been the frontrunners to lead Europe’s bid to reclaim the trophy in Rome since Lee Westwood surprisingly withdrew his name from the captaincy race. Robert Karlsson and Paul Lawrie completed a four-man shortlist presented to a European Ryder Cup selection panel. There has always been the prevailing sense, though, that the role is Stenson’s to lose. Stenson’s situation is however complicated by his close links with the Saudi proposal fronted by Greg Norman. The DP World – formerly European – Tour stands in direct opposition to the scheme. It has been an open secret in golf that Stenson, a former Open champion, would have to provide ongoing commitment to the DP World Tour before his captaincy status could be endorsed. The Swede is known to have held discussions with Keith Pelley, the DP World Tour’s chief executive, and the Ryder Cup director Guy Kinnings last week at the Players Championship. Should Stenson have suitably distanced himself from the Saudis during those talks, he will be the Ryder Cup captain. Donald, a former world No 1, represented Europe in four Ryder Cups which all resulted in victories. He was a vice-captain for the 2018 Ryder Cup success in Paris. The captain of the US team, as prevailed by a record margin at Whistling Straits last year, has already been confirmed as Zach Johnson.",Sport/Sport,Europe finally set to reveal name of 2023 Ryder Cup captain,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/15/europe-ryder-cup-captain-2023-decision-henrik-stenson-luke-donald-golf
3/15/2022,"Almost 89,000 people have offered homes to Ukrainian refugees in the first hours of a government scheme that allows families and individuals to bring them to the UK. The website for registering interest in the scheme crashed for a short while because of the numbers offering homes. By 9am on Tuesday, 88,712 had joined the scheme. The Foreign Office minister, James Cleverly, said “10,000 people every hour” were signing up. A spokesman said the Homes for Ukraine website “temporarily stalled” after it went live late on Monday afternoon, owing to the “enormous generosity of the British public”. He said the total number of offers was continuing to rise, with offers doubling within hours. Almost 3 million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion, with more internally displaced as cities are shelled. Until Monday, only Ukrainians with family links to the UK could apply for visas that would give them access to work and benefits. But on Monday Michael Gove announced that sponsors could bring any Ukrainian to the UK to live in their home for a minimum of six months, for which they would receive a £350 monthly payment. Under the scheme, refugees will be allowed to live and work in the UK for up to three years and receive full and unrestricted access to benefits, healthcare, employment and other support. Cleverly said he was proud that the numbers of people wanting to help Ukrainians meant the website had crashed. “Frankly, I’m glad we moved quickly on this and we’re moving quickly to ensure we’re able to help the Ukrainian refugees,” he said. “I know this is a weird thing to say as a government minister – I’m glad the website crashed, because it is a reflection of that generosity of the British people.” Asked whether he would be taking part in the scheme, Cleverly said: “I have genuinely considered this. I’ve discussed this with my wife. I don’t know whether our personal circumstances will allow us to do this right at the moment. “As you know, Nick, my wife, she’s going through medical treatment at the moment, but it’s absolutely something that I’m considering.” The administration of the scheme has been criticised by Labour as families need to identify a Ukrainian family they wish to sponsor. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, called it a “DIY scheme” and said: “He can’t seriously be asking Ukrainian families who are fleeing Vladimir Putin, who have left their homes with nothing, to get on to Instagram and advertise themselves in the hope that a British family might notice them.” Cleverly said local authorities would get the help they needed. “We don’t know how many will seek refuge and for how long,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. He said charities and faith groups would lead on matching people with refugees seeking to come to the UK, adding that the government taking over the matching would be a “slow and bureaucratic process”.",News/World news,"Refugee website crashes as 89,000 Britons rush to take in Ukrainians",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/homes-for-ukraine-website-crashes-refugees
3/15/2022,"There have been no games in either league for more than a month, but there has been plenty of conflict and drama in both Major League Baseball and the National Football League. On one hand, we had MLB locking out its players – delaying the start of the 2022 season – to put maximum pressure on the players’ association. On the other, the NFL is preparing its response to former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores’s racial discrimination lawsuit. What’s the connection? Well, both situations involve entities that represent the interests of team owners – all fantastically wealthy – in very real public relations battles. In both situations, the NFL and MLB have acted as if they have the edge thanks to their very substantial financial resources. It’s entirely possible that they’re both right, although MLB may be pushing things farther than it realizes. Let’s start with Flores’s lawsuit which alleges, among other things, racially discriminatory hiring practices in the NFL. More specifically, it calls out the Rooney Rule, which requires NFL teams to consider a minority candidate when looking to make a head coaching change. Critics have long suspected that, in practice, the Rooney Rule is a loophole-filled directive that has mostly resulted in teams conducting sham interviews with candidates that they have no intention of hiring. The details in Flores’s lawsuit, particularly damning text messages from New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, appear to back this up. Flores, who currently has an assistant coaching job with the Pittsburgh Steelers, claims that he refused an offer worth millions of dollars to sign a non-disparagement agreement with the Dolphins. If true, it would be difficult to imagine this wasn’t a common occurrence in an industry swarming with high-profile scandals. Throwing money at problems has worked for the league in the past. Remember the lawsuit filed by Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid alleging that they were frozen out of the NFL after they began kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality? The league found the suit to be so potentially disruptive that it settled with the two under the condition that the public never get to know the details. The whole concept is a variation on the theme that “punishable by fine” doesn’t mean “illegal” but “legal for those who can afford it.” As Leverage writer John Rogers often comments on Twitter, “a fine is a price.” For most of us, a parking fine is a deterrent. If you happen to be Jeff Bezos, however, there’s nothing stopping you from making a mockery of such laws by paying off $160,000 worth of parking fines for a group of contractors you’ve hired. In the NFL, it’s possible for those on top to buy silence, but often the league doesn’t even need to do that. There are only so many jobs in the NFL, so there’s a natural self-preservation instinct among its employees. The reason that the actions of Flores, Kaepernick and Reid are notable is that they actually put their careers on the line. MLB also benefits from the one-sided nature of the employer-employee relationship. Under commissioner Rob Manfred, MLB made the decision to lock out its players in an attempt to tip the scales even further in the team owners’ direction. Thankfully for baseball fans, the league and the MLB Players Association have resolved their issues for the time being and the start of the regular season has only been delayed by a week. The question remains: why did the league feel like it could risk losing an entire season in the first place? Well, it starts with the fact that the MLB teams have the financial upper hand: rich owners can absorb the lost revenue easily while the vast majority of their employees cannot. After all, April games aren’t typically hot tickets anyway. If you look at the lockout from a financial standpoint, it seems like MLB was in danger of cutting off its nose to spite its face by putting the season in jeopardy. However, this isn’t all about money – if it were, Manfred wouldn’t have waited 43 days to make his first proposal to the MLB Players Association – this was part of a power play, possibly an overt attempt to break the union. It was, in a way, an elaborate game of chicken, albeit one between a double-decker bus and a bicyclist. This time around, both sides emerged rattled but alive. In fact, this was probably the best possible outcome for those whose primary hope was for the work stoppage to end as quickly as possible. Simply by pressuring the players into accepting a deal this early in the process, the league can feel like it won. However, the incident raises the question of whether the league overplayed its hand in the process. MLB, it needs to be emphasized, is nowhere near as invulnerable as the mighty NFL, which has easily brushed aside controversies that would be existential threats to less-established sports entities. Neither concerns about CTE and the lingering effects of concussions nor the polarizing culture wars that surrounded Kaepernick’s kneel-downs have had much effect on the league’s popularity. Even Flores’s lawsuit, released for maximum exposure during the lead-up to this year’s Super Bowl, was overshadowed by the cynical yet effective deployment of a halftime celebration of hip-hop. Meanwhile, professional baseball lost a significant amount of support after the 1994-95 players’ strike, to the point where a home run chase of dubious authenticity is credited as “saving the sport.” Although still highly profitable, baseball’s popularity, particularly among younger fans, has dipped during Manfred’s time in charge. Calling for a lockout so soon after the pandemic-shortened season of 2020 felt like a clear example of the league prioritizing short-term gains over the long-term health of the sport. Not that there will be a reckoning any time soon. It’s likely that the owners don’t think MLB will suffer or they think they will be able to cash out before their audience begins dying out. When the least valuable team in the league (the Miami Marlins) is worth around $990m, team owners may be correct in thinking that MLB – like the NFL – is simply too rich to fail.",Sport/Sport,Are MLB and the NFL simply too rich to fail?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/15/are-mlb-and-the-nfl-simply-too-rich-to-fail
3/15/2022,"In Emily Berry’s third collection, Unexhausted Time, nothing is off limits and limits themselves are consciously defied: the membrane between waking and dreaming is semi-permeable, the boundary between past and present is blurred: “How is it the things that happen to us seem to have happened already,” she asks in one unsettled and untitled poem (titles are rarities here). In another, she blends with the weather as if her body were unconfinable: “Prolonged heat made me feel smudged./It was not a bad feeling…/to be a smear on a windowpane…” Her metaphors are prone to melting too or, at least, not allowed a final say. Berry’s earlier collections were more anchored: Dear Boy (2013) was a buoyantly liberated debut and Stranger, Baby (2017) a moving response to her mother’s death, underpinned by loss. This book is driven by ambivalent maturity. More than ever, there is a sustained wariness about the words she uses so well: she resists the way that words, like capable housekeepers, purport to sort things out when atmospheres are so often defiantly non-verbal. The first poem ends: I’m expecting somethingand it feels like wearing a silk shirt…Language incorrigible, same as hurt. “Incorrigible” – a word for tiresome jokers – gives pause for thought. Berry has a chafing relationship with language. In another poem, she countenances the same problem differently: “I will tell you in detail what is affecting me./ How in their abundance words can seem/quite desolate.” The implication is that truth is liable to prove sparse, beyond what words can do, like the “very old song” she describes in another poem that is known yet imaginary (as in never actually heard). She has a gift for identifying feelings at the back of the mind that are like thoughts you would prefer not to think. Bad Stone is a stunning poem about a “pale green stone” purchased from a crystal shop. “Bad” appears often in her writing: childlike, uncompromising and simple (it makes you realise how seldom the word is used in a serious, adult way, commonly replaced by fancier alternatives). The bad stone (semi-precious or cursed?) stands for part of the mind aware of profound wrongness and unable to decide what to do. “I hardly ever saw it, in its place on the window ledge it was outside, out of sight, at the furthest margins of my home.” Banishing the stone, inevitably, does no good. Berry’s poetry is haulage and sometimes involves bringing bad to light. Nightmare poems abound – brutal and involuntary – and are another version of haulage. Dream interpreters, get busy: a snake needs murdering and is bashed on the head with a ladle; a colossal pink mockingbird persecutes in the garden of a stately home; a baby is squeamishly muddled up with a tampon. Other poems, as the bibliography attests, are sparked by miscellaneous encounters with the words of others: Sigmund Freud, Thomas Mann, Sarah Kane. A fascinating podcast with Sharon Olds feeds one poem, Mark Fisher’s interview with dubstep artist Burial in the Wire is rearranged to become the text of another, Joan Didion speaking in her nephew’s documentary The Center Will Not Hold is quoted too. The centre does not hold in Berry’s world. The repurposing of words involves permeability of a different sort. Elopements with text lead to marriages that intrigue and challenge. As readers, we need to meet these strange and intimate poems with a mind as open as Berry’s and then be guided by our own inner compass. I felt I was born in a time when a lot of stuffwas just…not known…So we asked,what was it like, to be a human being…?The clouds flushed with theirridiculous secret, light.Our minds like a playing field in spring…Most feelings are very old, they havebeen under the earth and then upto the surface again, they have beenin the vapour of clouds and all acrossthe surface of the sky like hairline cracksin the glaze on porcelain, our motivationsunder the river like pebbles or like the livesof unseen creatures that keep us alive…There was a song we had never heard before,it was a very old song, it was a song,we once knew but an imaginary one.Listening to it was like looking at the skyat a certain time of day, on certain days,in midsummer, as it slowly pulls itself apart.There were so many times I wanted to give upbut then a message would appearfrom a complete stranger, from miles away,telling me to go on.

3/15/2022,"Not to be confused with the half-dozen or so other films with the same (or similar) name, this brisk but effective drama offers a timely reminder of just how hard it is to cross borders, especially into countries that might not want you there. This Europa premiered last year, when the conversation about immigration focused mainly on those fleeing war-ravaged or even just unstable places in the Middle East or Africa. Such immigrants were far more likely to be met with hostility at Europe’s edges than the compassion the west is currently extending to refugees from Ukraine, so that sheer accident of the release schedule throws this film into a whole new light. Viewers can’t but fail to be aware of the discrepancy between how two different sets of people have been treated but hopefully the attention on those fleeing Russian aggression will help us all to have more understanding for people like Kamal (Adam Ali) the Iraqi protagonist of this story, who is first met trying to cross the border between Turkey and Bulgaria on a moonlit night along with several others from different countries. An opening block of contextualising prose lays out the fact that the corrupt guides that migrants pay for help are actually in cahoots with police and civilian militias who violently hunt down border-crossers. Consequently, the film plays almost like some horrible dystopian-themed first-person adventure game with a constricted field of vision (not unlike Oscar-winning Holocaust drama Son of Saul), as the camera hovers next to the panicked, perpetually-in-motion Kamal. The camera even follows him as he scrambles up a tree to hide and sees another man killed in cold blood right below him. Later, in a quite extraordinary scene shown intentionally without subtitles, an injured Kamal manages to flag down a passing motorist (Svetlana Yancheva) and persuades her to give him a lift to the hospital. The camera flicks back and forth between their faces as she listens to a radio broadcast in Bulgarian and suddenly becomes repulsed and angry with Kamal, seemingly afraid of what she has just heard, and throws him out of the car. These extraordinary visuals are enhanced by beautifully composed and balanced sound design, that mixes human noises off, the sound of birds (listen for the woodpecker) and the natural world, constantly underscored by Kamal’s strained breathing. While writer-director Haider Rashid’s film-making is bravura stuff indeed, as a piece of storytelling it comes up a little short. We hardly know anything about the protagonist apart from the fact that he’s Iraqi, a fast runner and fond of songs with lyrics about mother love, and the ambiguous ending feels a bit flat. Nevertheless this is an intense and empathic work that deserves to be seen.

3/15/2022,"Canada has promised to resettle an “unlimited” number of displaced Ukrainians, and officials in country’s Prairie region want to be the first choice for those fleeing Russia’s invasion. But despite strong public support, bureaucratic delays at the federal level have highlighted the challenge of quickly resettling those fleeing war. The United Nations estimates more than two and a half million people have escaped Ukraine since Russia invaded the country in late February, creating the worst refugee crisis on the European continent since the upheaval of the second world war. While eastern European nations have absorbed the vast majority of refugees, Canada, home to the second largest Ukrainian diaspora, has agreed to resettle as many people as it can amid a mounting humanitarian crisis. “We will allow [Ukrainians] to study, work, when they come here,” Justin Trudeau told reporters during a trip to Poland last week. “Many of them will hope to be able to return to Ukraine after this conflict, many will also choose to continue their lives in Canada, and we look forward to welcoming as many as we can.” The federal government has created a new visa system, permitting Ukrainians to stay in Canada for as long as two years – but those looking to travel won’t receive federal government support afforded to many refugees. Instead, new arrivals will probably have to rely on the generosity of Canadians to get settled. “There’s a huge outpouring of support for hosting families right now,” said Ostap Skrypnyk, a member of the Manitoba chapter of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress and vice-president of the Canada Ukraine Foundation. The Congress has been so overwhelmed with interest in helping resettle families that it had to temporarily pause the process after receiving more than 700 applications in less than 48 hours. “And these people are signing up to help not even knowing what will be asked of them.” Last week, Saskatchewan’s minister of immigration said his government wanted to make the province the first choice for Ukrainians, announcing hundred of thousands in funding to help the resettlement process. Saskatchewan has one of the largest Ukrainian populations in Canada, with 13% of residents identifying with Ukrainian heritage, many of whose ancestors came to farm the land under government programs in previous decades. Despite popular support for resettlement, Canada’s recent failure to resettle tens of thousands of Afghan refugees as promised has prompted concern its pledge for “unlimited” Ukrainians might fall short. Since early March, Canada has resettled only 8,580 of the promised 40,000 Afghan refugees since the country was taken over by Taliban forces in August 2021. “Will the visa system be inundated when it goes live next week? Will it be able to hold and will they be able to really process people in a timely manner?” said Skrypnyk. “We’ll just have to wait and see. But when you build up new architecture, there are always blips.” Federal immigration minister Sean Fraser told CBC News that his department can “do more than one thing at a time” amid worry the government’s recent focus on Ukraine would once again delay those efforts to aid Afghans and also slow down new visa applications. Once families are approved, documents will be issued in as little as two weeks, meaning the first wave could arrive in early April. “Seeing images of war and this huge influx of people in Poland and Slovakia, there’s been this sense of helplessness in the Ukrainian community here,” said Skrypnyk. “And so when these first families began arriving, there’s finally something we can do for them. We can help.”",News/World news,Delays hamper Canada’s bid to resettle Ukrainians fleeing war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/canada-ukraine-russia-visa-settlement-program
3/15/2022,"Joe Biden came into the White House vowing to restore American leadership on the world stage. But the tumultuous end to the war in Afghanistan last year shook Americans’ confidence in their new commander-in-chief, raising doubts about his competence and judgment and sending his approval ratings tumbling. Now Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has given Biden a second chance to demonstrate the steady leadership he promised, raising hopes among Democrats that the White House’s efforts to punish Moscow for its shocking aggression will resonate with voters in this year’s midterm elections. But Democrats face stiff headwinds in their attempt to defy historical trends and maintain their narrow majorities in Congress. Among their biggest obstacles are Biden’s deep unpopularity and the rising cost of gas, food and rent, for which Republicans have faulted Democrats. At the Democrats’ annual retreat in Philadelphia last week, party leaders spoke of a world – and an electorate – reshaped by Russia’s invasion of its democratic neighbor. They said the conflict provided a new clarity of purpose – and a new villain: Russian leader Vladimir Putin. As the war in Ukraine threatens to push already rising gas prices even higher, Democrats are blaming “Putin’s tax hike”. At the same time, they are touting the administration’s role coordinating a worldwide response to Russia, and the devastating impact of economic sanctions, highlighting a contrast with former president Donald Trump, who has continued to praise Putin. “That economic bomb that went off inside that dictator’s regime would not have been possible without Joe Biden’s leadership,” New York congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of House Democrats’ election campaign arm, said in Philadelphia. This strategy comes with considerable risk. Foreign policy is rarely front of mind for voters. The situation remains volatile and unpredictable. And Republicans are arguing that inflation was on the rise long before Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine. In a recent op-ed for CNBC, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy blamed the administration’s energy policy for exacerbating the current crisis. “Unfortunately, the Democrats’ wayward leadership for the past year has undermined America’s energy potential with senseless policies that seem designed to reverse decades of success and wreak havoc on our gas prices,” he wrote. Yet Democrats see some reasons to be hopeful. Recent surveys have shown an uptick in support for Biden, buoyed by approval of his handling of the conflict in Ukraine, though his overall ratings are still mired in the low 40s. Americans broadly say they support the administration’s response to the conflict, which includes efforts to cripple Russia’s economy and aid Ukraine. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, Americans overwhelmingly favor a ban on oil and gas purchases from Russia, even if it means paying more at the pump. Among those respondents, a quarter said they would be willing, at least in theory, to pay as much as it takes to support Ukraine, while 32% said they would be willing to pay between $1 and $2 more per gallon and 11% said they would be willing to pay more than $2 more. Whether voters blame Putin or Democrats for the rising cost of their gas may yet be a central question of the midterm election. “Democrats didn’t cause this problem,” Biden told Democrats in Philadelphia. “Vladimir Putin did.” For American voters, foreign policy is often an issue that “doesn’t matter until it does,” said Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based thinktank. He said matters of war and peace have “represented two opposite turning points” in Biden’s presidency. While Afghanistan hurt his image as a statesman who could rebuild America’s credibility with allies after four turbulent years of Trump, Galston said the war in Europe has given the US president another chance to prove himself. “We’ve been through about three decades – the post cold-war era, which has now ended, thunderously – when foreign policy didn’t matter so much,” he said. “But now it does, and I expect that it will continue to, because now we face severe challenges on our western front in Europe and our eastern front in the Indo-Pacific.” He added that the conflict “has played to the strengths of president Biden and his foreign policy team: they are all deeply transatlantic in their history and their commitments.” As a senator and vice-president, Biden worked to strengthen the alliances forged in the aftermath of the second world war. Now as president, he sought to unite democracies around the world against the threat of rising autocracies, an effort complicated by the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol and the widespread belief among Republican voters that the 2020 election was stolen. In recent weeks, Biden has rallied world leaders, tapping his deep foreign policy experience to reinvigorate old alliances that his predecessor had disparaged and nearly abandoned. “I’ve spent literally hours and hours and hours and hours keeping the alliance together – the EU, Nato, and all of our allies, including our Asian allies,” he told Democrats in Philadelphia. “As a result, we’ve been able to ramp up our economic pressure on Putin and further isolate Russia on the global stage.” Inflation has weighed down Biden’s approval rating, as Republicans blame government spending and Democrats’ energy policies for the rising cost of gasoline. Research suggests that rising gas prices drives consumer pessimism, an effect that is particularly noticeable among Americans who lived through the 1970s oil crisis. Guy Cecil, chairman of the Democratic political action committee Priorities USA, told reporters during a briefing last week that Biden’s handling of the war “was reminding people why they voted for Joe Biden to begin with and, frankly, why they opposed Donald Trump”. Although much of the Democrats’ 2022 messaging will be focused on the party’s economic agenda and legislative accomplishments, Cecil said the war in Russia provides a stark contrast between the president and Trump, who has forced some in his party to walk a tightrope as they aim to condemn Putin without crossing the former president. Priorities USA recently released a dark new ad that highlights Trump’s repeated praise of Putin and accuses Republicans of aligning with a “murderous dictator”. “Donald Trump continues to say he wants to be a player in politics; he’s endorsing primary candidates around the country,” Cecil said. “He’s raising money for candidates at Mar-a-Lago. He’s doing campaign events, and I think every candidate should be held accountable for Trump’s position.” In Philadelphia, Democrats expressed confidence that Biden’s leadership in recent weeks would shake the long shadow cast by the administration’s exit from Afghanistan. “I’m not surprised that his numbers have already bounced back up, and I think you’re going to see that the worst is behind us, and the next chapter is going to be where the American people rediscover they elected a strong, decent man, who is fighting for very important things,” Maloney said. “And it’s the Democrats that are doing that with him against Republican opposition.”",News/US news,Will Biden’s handling of the Ukraine crisis prove popular with US voters?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/15/joe-biden-russia-ukraine-democrats-midterms
3/15/2022,"There are 21.7 seconds left on the clock. Team A’s center grabs a rebound with his team up by two, and he’s promptly fouled by Team B. Nineteen free throws, eight fouls, and about 20 minutes of real-time later, the final buzzer sounds. The center? Andre Drummond. Teams A and B? The Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks last month. Fans’ excitement after a fantastic game of basketball? Shattered. The end of the Clippers-Lakers match-up the day before wasn’t much better, with the final 25 seconds of the game taking up nearly 20 minutes in the real world. The final 25 seconds of Clippers-Lakers took roughly 19 minutes. Reviews began around 12:31 ET and the game ended around 12:50 ET. Like a bizzaro orchestra that builds dramatically before botching the crescendo, the flow of NBA games is in a dire state. It seems the league is now chock-full of relentless, fast-paced, end-to-end action routinely interrupted by jarring stoppages that serve as an unfortunate antidote to the excitement. Intentional fouls, lengthy reviews, excessive timeouts, and free-throws are diluting the potency of the NBA’s product at a time when the explosion of entertainment options across the internet makes loyal fans a precious commodity. Constant interruptions as time ticks down can be addressed, however. Perhaps the most striking problem is with intentional fouls. A brief explanation for non-basketball fans: a team trailing late in a game will often commit a foul rather than let their opponent run the clock down. The hope is that the team will miss an ensuing free throw, giving the trailing team a chance to grab possession and score. It’s a tactic that rarely works but nearly always extends games and slows down play. Basketball’s world governing body, Fiba, attempted to solve the matter a few years ago, amending the interpretation of an “unsportsmanlike foul”. The organization’s official rules now make a distinction between basketball and non-basketball plays, ie: grabbing a player v a genuine attempt to steal the ball. If the referee judges that the attempt was nothing more than an intentional foul then the team that was fouled is awarded two free throws and possession of the ball afterwards. This kills off any efforts by a team trailing their opponent in the final seconds to foul in order to extend the game. It appears many NBA fans would be open to the Fiba rule being adopted in the league. During last year’s Olympics many fans expressed delight at how fast games went by at Tokyo 2020 compared to those in the NBA. FIBA rules are perfect. Less time, less reviews, more physical. Start a game and get it over with in 2 hours or less. If only the national basketball association could get a clue. It’s not just fouls that are a problem though. In the NBA, each team is allowed seven timeouts per game. That’s 14 stoppages in a game where fouls and out-of-bounds plays already cut into the action. By allowing teams to constantly stop and readjust we are deprived of seeing ingenious players figuring problems out for themselves in real-time. Take, for example, Steph Curry’s famous three-pointer to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder in the final second of overtime in 2016. The Warriors had a timeout to use but instead Curry was allowed to trust his own skill and instincts. He went with the flow, leading to one of the greatest moments in NBA regular-season history. Some writers have called for the elimination of timeouts altogether. That’s going too far: there is something to be said for the chess match of coaches going back and forth. But we could easily cut the number of timeouts and shift the onus on to the players themselves – after all they’re the ones fans pay to watch rather than a guy in a suit on the sidelines. This wouldn’t eliminate the impact of coaching, in fact it would place even more importance on when to take timeouts. Adam Silver’s NBA prides itself on progressing the game on the court. The 14-second shot clock and this season’s adjustment to certain foul-baiting tendencies have been well-received. Even the All-Star Game has seen a rule change that has made the contest far more intriguing: now the first team to reach a pre-determined score wins. While that’s too extreme a move for the NBA proper – for a start buzzer-beaters are far too exciting to lose – the league would be a better place if it moved away from the fetishization of clock management. As the NBA celebrates its 75th anniversary this season, it should look at what has helped it pass the test of time: its malleability. The NBA today is vastly different from the NBA 25 years ago and it will look even more different in the future. So adjustments to how games end aren’t mere pipe dreams. This is a league that has constantly remolded itself and must continue to do so as it matures. Does the NBA need a massive revolution to fix its problems? Almost certainly not. While some of these suggestions are ambitious and possibly divisive, simply adjusting rules around intentional fouls would have a snowball effect on multiple in-game issues. The NBA has positioned itself as a progressive league on and off the court, and a few small tweaks could massively improve the flow of games as they reach their climax. With that done, we just need to cut the regular season schedule by 20 games and add relegation for basketball utopia …",Sport/Sport,"In the NBA, 20 seconds can last 20 minutes in real time.

3/15/2022,"Demand for workers is strong as the economy emerges from two years of pandemic-induced disruption. The supply of workers has been reduced by an increase in long-term sickness affecting mainly the over 50 age group. As a result, there is enough upward pressure on pay to persuade the Bank of England to continue raising interest rates, but the big squeeze on living standards has begun. The latest bulletin from the Office for National Statistics shows there is upward pressure on pay, but even so wages were struggling to keep pace with rising prices at the turn of the year and the gap looks set to widen during the course of 2022. Rishi Sunak said the labour market had bounced back more rapidly than many people expected – and the chancellor is right about that. Few would have imagined that following the end of the furlough scheme last autumn the unemployment rate in the three months to January would stand at 3.9%, within a whisker of its pre-Covid low. Or that more timely data from HMRC would show 275,000 people added to payrolls in February. Meanwhile, the pool of available workers shrank by 100,000 in the three months to January, in large part because of people retiring or being long-term sick. Firms are having trouble filling the record number of job vacancies, hence the upward pressure on pay. Even so, in the three months to January, pay barely kept up with prices. Pay including bonuses over that quarter was 4.8% higher than a year earlier, up from 4.6% in the three months ending in December. But the ONS says the annual inflation rate was running at 4.7%, leaving workers hardly any better off. The Bank of England has been surprised by the strength of the labour market in the past and is unlikely to be deterred from raising interest rates by the latest official jobs data, despite the uncertainty caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Yet higher borrowing costs, higher taxes and higher energy costs will weaken demand for labour over the coming months. For workers, this may be as good as it gets for quite a while.",News/Business,UK living standards face squeeze despite strong jobs market,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/15/uk-living-standards-jobs-market-prices-energy-unemployment
