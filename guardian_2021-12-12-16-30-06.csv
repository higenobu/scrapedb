12/12/2021,"Two competing forces will determine Omicron’s impact on the nation over the next few weeks. The power of booster jabs to give last-minute protection against Covid-19 will be pitted against the new variant’s ability to elude existing immunity. The outcome will decide whether our festive season is going to be muted or miserable. If enough arms are jabbed with booster vaccines, while Omicron turns out to have poor powers to evade immunity, then there is hope hospital cases will be contained and the NHS will be protected. Severe restrictions in the new year – including the prospect of lockdowns – could be avoided.  But if Omicron is found to evade existing immunity quite easily, while booster campaigns provide poor overall protection, then the country faces a very grim winter with strict restrictions needed for some time. According to a study by scientists at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the first scenario – poor Omicron escape from immunity matched by effective booster jab protection – would trigger a wave of infection that could lead to 175,000 hospital admissions and 24,700 deaths by the end of April. Closure of some entertainment venues and restrictions on indoor hospitality would be enough to control case numbers. By contrast, the most pessimistic scenario – high immune escape from vaccines and low effectiveness of booster jabs – would see 74,800 deaths while there would be 492,000 hospital admissions, a figure twice as high as the peak seen in January 2021. Far stricter restrictions, including lockdowns, would then have to be considered. “These results suggest that Omicron has the potential to cause substantial surges in cases, hospital admissions and deaths in populations with high levels of immunity, including England,” the team state in their paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed. Nicholas Wright, co-leader of the study team, described Omicron’s threat to the UK as “worrying”. Presented with evidence like this, many scientists have warned that urgent action should now be taken to hold back infections while booster campaigns are accelerated and given time to take effect. “Cases are doubling every two to three days which means there is a real risk the curve is going to get very steep around Christmas and New Year,” said the vaccine expert Peter English. “That means panic measures could be brought in at the last minute and disrupt people’s festive plans. I am also desperately sad for my colleagues in clinical practice who face a January that is going to be worse than anything we’ve seen so far and at a time when they are now exhausted.” However, the epidemiologist Prof Mark Woolhouse, of Edinburgh University, counselled caution. “Lockdown interventions buy time, that is true, but they also cause wider harm. Other, more sustainable measures – such as wider use of self-testing – may prove to be more viable.” The crucial point about making strict interventions was not to prevent the population getting Covid but to avoid too many people getting it at the same time, he added. “I don’t expect to live out my years without getting Covid once or twice some time in the future – and that applies to the rest of the population. Individual risks have not changed. The problem is that it looks as though an awful lot of us are going to encounter it in the next few weeks.” Other scientists said they were slightly more optimistic. The virologist Prof Ian Jones, of Reading University, said the grimmest scenarios did not take into account the availability of new antiviral drugs that have been shown to lessen the impact of the virus if given soon after infection. “If this better clinical picture is factored in, the link between infection and severe disease may not be as high as assumed here, and the outcome not as alarming.” This point was backed by Prof Paul Hunter, an infectious diseases expert at the University of East Anglia, who said there was evidence that Omicron was associated with less severe disease and that models overestimated hospital admissions, possibly substantially. “I suspect these models overstate risk of hospitalisation and deaths and the worst case scenarios are unlikely to be seen.” If the dangers of Omicron turn out to be exaggerated, the prospects of further variants disrupting society cannot be ignored, said the global health researcher Michael Head, of Southampton University, who accused rich countries including the UK of hoarding vaccines instead of sending them to nations with less well-developed health services. “We don’t know how often this coronavirus can change its clothes and emerge with a new look but the risks of new variants emerging are higher in under-vaccinated populations. The coronavirus has not finished with us.”",News/World news,Will Omicron kill Christmas?

12/12/2021,"Rinko Kawauchi began taking pictures of fireworks when she was living alone in Tokyo in 1997. At the time, she was spending her days working out what kind of photographer she wanted to be, a process she recalls as “agonising trial and repetition”. Often in the evenings she would find firework displays, which, she says, provided her “with a sort of healing… Alongside people of all ages, I would look up at the sky and marvel at the beautiful sparks. In an instant they would vanish – and so would we return to our own daily lives. In a chaotic world, such moments felt like salvation: an affirmation of being alive.” Her images from that time are included in a group exhibition devoted to the broad theme of fire, involving finalists for this year’s Prix Pictet at the V&A. Many of the pictures in the show focus on awful incendiary power: the inferno and aftermath of forest fires that are an ever more common feature of the warming planet and the charred devastation that fire can bring to environments and to communities. Kawauchi’s photographs provide little epiphanies of human joy in that context.  This one looks almost medieval in its collective engagement with the heavens. The crowd, bathed in milky blue light, fixes its attention on the sudden, human-made star of wonder in the east. The spectacle appears hardly dulled by familiarity, as if the singular brilliance above the horizon, with its trail of fire, were a cosmic event or a portent. “I always keep poeticism in mind during my image-making process,” Kawauchi says. Her firework pictures, far from a night-time distraction, influenced her subsequent work, which has been all about capturing the ways in which everyday experience is sometimes flooded with surprising and ephemeral light.

12/12/2021,"Winter storms in the hills can change the best of plans. Outside the door of the tiny Norwegian touring cabin, snow is blowing sideways and drifting across our tracks. Wreaths of mist filter the surrounding trees into charcoal smudges. Walking to the woodshed, let alone a long day travelling on skis with heavy rucksacks, seems unappealing. So we throw another log into the woodburner and break out the cards and Kindles to wait out the weather.  My wife and I are in Sandfløten, a small hut in the woods in the mountains east of Lillehammer. The plan on this short tour is to cross an area of ungroomed ski paths to link up with huts on the managed cross-country ski trails around the resort of Sjusjøen – around four days’ travelling in total. With a tight schedule, a lost day means a change of plans: we will now retrace our route over two days via the Målia hut to our starting point. We are on our first tour together on backcountry skis, heavier metal-edged cross-country skis. While we had both done cross-country day trips in the past, and I’d been touring on Alpine skis, this is our first multi-day trip on Nordic touring gear. The idea was born a couple of months earlier, when we spent Christmas in Oslo and went cross-country skiing from a metro station on the outskirts out into the forest. So we’d joined the Norwegian Trekking Association (the DNT), which runs a network of more than 500 huts, and planned to come back and ski from hut to hut. The plan is to travel light. Take the train from Oslo and a bus to our starting point. Then leave a change of clothes and our ski bags at a hotel in Hamar. Everything else – dehydrated meals, sleeping bags, a collapsible snow shovel, dry clothes for the hut – will go in the rucksacks. We plotted the route for ease and safety, following well-travelled parts of the Hedmarksvidda, an area of low mountain moorland dotted with hamlets and crossed by roads. Our starting point is the small ski station at Budor. From the trailhead, the skiing will be all uphill at first until we hit a rolling plateau. We clip into the skis and kick off, the waxed bases gripping as we set off uphill, quickly warming up, and finding a slow but steady rhythm. After a while the trees thin out into a rolling white landscape dotted with small copses, with higher fells visible in the distance. The first descents, with rucksacks pulling our centres of gravity backwards, are a little tense, but everything is working. At a crossroads we meet a wiry skier in his mid-60s who plans to ski 50km that day. We are much less ambitious, aiming for the Målia, a half-day’s travel away. The DNT’s huts come in three classes: catered, where hot meals are served; semi-catered like Målia, where there is a larder and food is bought on an honesty system; and uncatered, where there is cooking gas, firewood and beds. A master key, supplied for a deposit, unlocks all of the cabins. We reach an empty hut, let ourselves in and light the stove to warm it up and start drying our kit, damp from the day’s efforts. This hut sleeps 10 and can be busy in Norway’s winter school holidays in normal times – but not last winter, in the throes of the pandemic. (It is understood that visitors to huts that do not need booking can sleep on the floor.) The solar-powered hut batteries are full, which means there’s electric light and we can charge our phones and GPS. We cook a meal and settle down to read. After dark, another guest arrives with her dog, who sleeps in a crate provided in one of the rooms. The next day takes us over hillier terrain, downhill at first and then a climb to a small hamlet and before a descent to an icy road. From here the trail is tougher to the next hut, the uncatered shelter at Sandfløten. The unmade path leads through dense woods across hidden stream beds and tripping roots, marked occasionally by paint blazes that are easy to miss. We are following the map, GPS and some old ski tracks from time to time. Evening is falling and the hut, when we reach it, is visible only when we are almost on it, a dark cube among the trees. The last visitor, we see from the guestbook, was here two weeks ago. There is more work to do here. The hut’s door and the path to the woodshed and toilet need shovelling. The cooking gas canister and spare are both empty, which means boiling water for our dehydrated meals requires heating it from melted snow, a laborious process. But it is warm and cosy inside. We go for an evening ski through the woods around the hut, making our own tracks across the snow-covered ponds and frozen marshes. When it comes, the storm begins gently. The morning of the third day should take us through untracked woods and over a small pass. The mist creeps in and then the first flurries of snow fall. The weather worsens quickly and the trees are dim in front of us. We could navigate through the forest but opt to turn back to Sandfløten. Soon there’s wind and a heavy fall of snow. As we are sleeping, a warm front passes over, bringing rain, followed by another freeze. Retracing our steps towards Målia, we encounter challenging conditions. Lower down the snow is wet and heavy. As we climb up again we find fresh drifts that have frozen solid like hummocks of ice-cream, pretty but slippery and very difficult to ski. What had been relatively easy on the way out is now exhausting. At times the skis come off and we walk the most challenging sections. The last day is kinder, with a dusting of fresh snow. As we have breakfast, the track-making machine passes the hut, repairing the route to Budor. The skiing is pleasant as we come back over the plateau to a mixture of dark clouds and sunshine that lights up a silvery landscape. The final long descent to a lunch of pancakes and coffee in the cafe is fast and easy, and we think about a hot shower, clean clothes, a hotel bed and the train back to Oslo in the morning. We are tired but have a sense of achievement. The memory of the woods around Sandfløten with only the sound of the wind and birds calling will linger for a long time.",Lifestyle/Travel,Finding a slow but steady rhythm: a self-guided skiing tour through Norway’s forests,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/dec/12/self-guided-cross-country-skiing-tour-norway-forests
12/12/2021,"The Chief’s Chief is the most consequential book on the Trump presidency. In his memoir, Mark Meadows confesses to possibly putting Joe Biden’s life in jeopardy and then covering it up – all in easily digested prose and an unadorned voice. If nothing else, the book has provided plenty of ammunition for Donald Trump to have concluded that Meadows “betrayed” him.  Trump has trashed The Chief’s Chief as “fake news”, derided Meadows as “fucking stupid”, and falsely claimed that the book “confirmed” that he “did not have Covid before or during the debate”. Actually, when it comes to events in Cleveland on 29 September 2020, Meadows writes: “We’ll probably never know whether President Trump was positive that evening.” But we know he very well might have been. And to think Trump gave Meadows a blurb for his cover: “We will have a big future together”. Hopefully, Meadows received at least 30 pieces of silver as an advance. By the numbers, Trump came in contact with approximately 500 people between the time he received his first positive test, which was followed by a negative one, and his announcement that he did indeed have Covid. Not surprisingly, Trump blamed others for giving him the virus, even intimating that gold star military families did it. Last week, after the Guardian broke news of Meadows’ book, Michael Shear of the New York Times recalled: “Hours after he received the call from Meadows informing him of a positive test, Trump came to the back of AF1 without a mask and talked with reporters for about 10 minutes.” “Several days later”, Shear himself tested positive. The 45th president looks like “patient zero”, a one-man super-spreader. Switching topics, Meadows tags Biden for getting overly handsy and says Andrew Cuomo ogled Hope Hicks. Unsurprisingly, Meadows omits mention of allegations against his own boss. Just one example? E Jean Carroll’s defamation lawsuit against Trump, arising from an alleged rape in a department store dressing room. Turning to Republican politics, Meadows, a former North Carolina congressman, accuses John Boehner, once House Speaker, of acting like a “Mafia Don”. Again, Meadows does not mention the boss’s behavior. As reported by Joshua Green in Devil’s Bargain, Trump once laced into Paul Manafort, his sometime campaign manager, thus: “You treat me like a baby! Am I like a baby to you … Am I a fucking baby, Paul?” Manafort was convicted on bank and tax charges in 2018. But he stayed a loyal foot soldier and received a pardon from Trump. With Christmas just weeks away, Meadows throws in the following Trump quote as a holiday bonus: “I’m the only one who can save us.” Meadows isn’t the sole Trump administration alum doing his darnedest to portray their guy as America’s saviour. But he is the only one who lets us know Trump tested positive before he tested negative. And that makes his book one for the ages. Other would-be stocking stuffers by Trump insiders convey that they were either in the dark about that fateful Covid test or took care not to share. Kayleigh McEnany, Trump’s final press secretary; Peter Navarro, an economics adviser; and Scott Atlas, a Covid adviser, are out with books of their own. In her non-tell-all, McEnany makes sure we know of her academic credentials and reiterates her claim that she never lied to reporters. After all, she writes, her education at “Oxford, Harvard and Georgetown” meant she always relied on “truthful, well-sourced, well-researched information”. She doesn’t mention her time at the University of Miami much. But no matter. Elite degrees say more about future earnings and marriage prospects than a penchant for truth. Trump attended the University of Pennsylvania. Boris Johnson, Oxford. Richard Nixon went to Duke and Bill Clinton is a graduate of Yale. Nixon was disbarred, Clinton’s law license suspended. Boris is Boris. McEnany thanks the deity repeatedly. Her title, For Such a Time as This, riffs off the Book of Esther. She stays on message for more than 200 pages, lauding Trump for standing for “faith, conservatism and freedom”. But that first positive Covid test, on 26 September, described by Meadows and since confirmed by Maggie Haberman and other pillars of the Washington press? Nada. McEnany writes that on 1 October 2020, two days after the Trump-Biden debate, she learned for the first time that Trump and Melania had “tested positive for Covid-19”. On 2 October, Trump was helicoptered to hospital. On 5 October, McEnany was told she had the virus too. She does not draw a line to Trump’s recklessness. “Thankfully,” she writes, “everyone in the White House made a full and complete recovery, including me.” Not true. McEnany does not mention Crede Bailey, head of the White House security office. When she was Trump’s press secretary, she did. Asked about Bailey at a briefing, McEnany said: “Our heart goes out to his family. They have asked for privacy. And he is recovering, from what I understand. We are very pleased to see that. But he and his family will be in our prayers.” On a GoFundMe page set up to help pay for Bailey’s treatment, a friend wrote: “Crede beat Covid-19 but it came at a significant cost: his big toe on his left foot as well as his right foot and lower leg had to be amputated.” Bailey also suffered long-term lung, heart, liver and kidney damage. According to his family, Trump has never publicly acknowledged Bailey’s “illness”. McEnany delivers a bouquet to Meadows. “You were a constant reminder of faith,” she gushes. “Thank you for being an inspiring leader for the entire West Wing.” Navarro would probably disagree. In fact, it’s a good bet he would concur with Trump’s new assessment of Meadows’ intelligence. In his book, In Trump Time, Navarro repeatedly takes Meadows to task for insufficient loyalty and accessibility. According to Navarro, after Trump lost to Biden, the White House chief of staff’s heart and body were too often not at the White House. “Wherever the heck” Meadows was, Navarro says, he sounded “like Napoleon after Waterloo, getting ready to be shipped out to Elba”. Navarro also blames Meadows for failing to heed a purported warning in 2019 from Cleta Mitchell, a Republican activist and lawyer, that the Democrats “were getting ready to steal the election”. When Meadows was pressed in September 2020 about his failure to act on this tip, Navarro says, all he could muster was, “It just didn’t happen.” The fact that both the House and Senate have documented Meadows’ efforts to put the squeeze on Republican election officials fails to impress Navarro. The Chief’s Chief may have also waived Meadows’ claim of executive privilege. Either way, Meadows’s latest about-face on cooperating with the House select committee investigating the events of 6 January is unlikely to alter Navarro’s impression of him. As for Mitchell, she resigned from her law firm over her role in an infamous call between Trump and Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state. On top of pushing the line that the Democrats stole the election, Navarro lambasts numerous officials for failing to confront China, Mike Pence among them. Significantly, as he goes after Trump’s star-crossed vice-president, Navarro sounds a now-familiar trope of the anti-democratic right. He brands Pence a treacherous “Brutus” who betrayed Trump, an “American Caesar”. Did Navarro forget those gallows bearing Pence’s name? Regardless, the shoutout to a murdered Roman emperor is meant as a full-throated compliment. During the 2016 campaign, Paul LePage, then governor of Maine, thought Trump needed to show some “authoritarian power”. Last May, Michael Anton of the rightwing Claremont Institute pondered whether the US needed a caesar. Anton was joined on air by Curtis Yarvin, AKA Mencius Moldbug, a self-described monarchist and pillar of the Dark Enlightenment, a take embraced by the alt-right. Navarro demands “full forensic audits” of the 2020 election and posits that the 6 January insurrection may have been “perpetrated by those who sought to provoke an attack on our Capitol as a means of derailing” a Trump electoral college win. In A Plague Upon Our House, Scott Atlas goes after Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci for grabbing headlines but ignores both Trump’s prediction that Covid, “one day – it’s like a miracle – it will disappear” and his admission to Bob Woodward that Covid would be worse than he told the public. Covid has killed nearly 800,000 Americans – and counting. The US faces another Covid winter, with more than 100,000 new cases daily and the Omicron variant looming. Vaccine resistance and Covid deaths have become red-state hallmarks. Atlas is a radiologist and a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University. He joined the Trump White House in August 2020 and resigned after the election. As a Covid adviser he opposed expanded testing and isolation, calling such measures “grossly misguided”. Rather, he argued that the virus could be stymied and herd immunity attained once 20% to 25% of the population contracted it. In his book, he appears to discount the impact of long Covid. Confronted by an open letter from Stanford faculty, challenging his credentials, Atlas threatened legal retaliation. Marc Kasowitz, Trump’s lawyer, demanded immediate retraction. None followed. Atlas, however, did get one big thing right: opposing school closures, which he characterized as an “egregious and inexplicable” policy failure. Closures helped cost the Democrats Virginia. Glenn Youngkin’s win in that race for governor was about more than critical race theory. Trump and Trumpism will remain a force in the Republican party in the years to come. Meadows, McEnaney, Navarro and Atlas are counting on it. Earlier this month, however, Chris Christie spoke at a dinner of DC poohbahs. “I gave Donald Trump my undying loyalty,” he said. “And as we learned this week, he definitely gave me Covid.” Just a reminder, folks.",Arts/Books,March of the Trump memoirs: Mark Meadows and other Republican reads,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/12/trump-memoirs-mark-meadows-kayleigh-mcenany-peter-navarro-scott-atlas
12/12/2021,"To understand the forces shaping American politics, one state will be impossible to overlook in 2022: Georgia. The Peach State will offer the biggest litmus test yet of former US president Donald Trump’s grip on the Republican party, and the persistence of his false claims of election fraud, as well as a guide to whether Democrats can expect the nation to move in their direction.  It will also offer something of a laboratory experiment for new voting restrictions and the threat they pose to democracy. “Georgia enters into the realm of Florida 2000, Ohio 2004, Pennsylvania 2020 as the pivotal state,” said John Zogby, an author and pollster. “It’ll be a benchmark for 2024. It’s important demographically because it’s in a state of balance right now. It’s having its moment.” The southern, socially conservative state was a bulwark of the Confederacy during the civil war. But it is now home to a film industry dubbed the “the Hollywood of the south”. It produced Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights hero. But it also produced Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a far-right conspiracy theorist. Its outsized role came into focus last year when Joe Biden became the first Democratic presidential nominee to win it since Bill Clinton in 1992. Then, in January, Democrats won two Senate runoff elections, giving Biden an unexpected majority and dramatically scaling up his ambitions. Now the plotlines that have dominated US politics for the past decade are set to converge in Georgia again. Trump supporters have turned out in force at local Republican meetings and sought to gain control of the state party apparatus, purging officials deemed insufficiently loyal. The ex-president has also inspired a slate of devotees to seek statewide office including former senator David Perdue, who this week launched a challenge against incumbent Republican governor Brian Kemp. Trump has fumed against Kemp over the governor’s refusal to overturn the election results last year, even after several recounts and audits affirmed Biden’s victory. Perdue has immediately grabbed on to the mantle of baseless election lies, telling Axios this week he would not have voted to certify the election, then joining a lawsuit seeking to prove he and Trump were cheated out of election victories. Kemp said last year he was required by law to certify the election. The former president called Kemp “a very weak governor” in a statement endorsing Perdue on Monday, citing nothing specific in his opposition to the sitting governor apart from his position on “election integrity”. “Most importantly,” Trump said of Kemp, “he can’t win because the MAGA [Make America great again] base — which is enormous — will never vote for him.” If he is proven wrong and Kemp prevails, it would be a humiliating defeat for Trump, offering a sign his influence over the Republican party is slipping. Such a rebuke might even help dissuade him from running for president again in 2024. Eric Erickson, a conservative writer and radio host based in Georgia, said: “It certainly would impact his electoral college map in 2024 and it would definitely suggest that the voters are ready to move on. When you look at the polling, I think people are looking towards 2024 and maybe they’re ready to look at the future instead of the past.” The primary for governor is not the only battle here with wider implications. Trump is backing former football star Herschel Walker in a Republican primary against state agriculture commissioner Gary Black. The winner will go forward to challenge Warnock. Lower down the ballot there is also a high stakes election for secretary of state, Georgia’s top election official. Trump has endorsed Jody Hice, a congressman, in his bid to oust fellow Republican Brad Raffensperger from the secretary of state’s office. Trump has attacked Raffensperger ever since he refused to go along with the then president’s request to “find” enough votes to overturn the election. Robert P Jones, chief executive and founder of the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), said: “We’ve got basically a Maga versus chamber of commerce battle going on and what makes it particularly poignant is the role that governor Brian Kemp and secretary of state Brad Raffensperger played in the last presidential election. “They were two Republicans that stood on the side of democracy and resisted Donald Trump’s request to overthrow the fair results of the election. In that way, they’ve they’ve been put in the crosshairs by Trump and are being challenged from the right by David Perdue on the one hand and Jody Hice on the other, both of whom have repeated this big lie that Trump actually won in Georgia.” “They’re essentially running on this Make America great again big lie, so it’ll be a real test to see how that plays out among Republicans in the primaries – before you even get to the general election.” Which ever Republican candidate for governor emerges from months of infighting they will still have to face Democrat Stacey Abrams, a voting rights activist bidding to become the first Black female governor in American history. Abrams narrowly lost to Kemp in 2018 in what proved a flashpoint election. It was a contest that encapsulated how Georgia is changing – Abrams, vying to be the first female Black governor in US history, symbolized a new progressive Georgia, while Kemp represented the old conservative guard. Such trends surfaced again in January when Democrats Raphael Warnock, who is African American, and Jon Ossoff, who is Jewish, defeated Kelly Loeffler and Perdue, both of whom are white. Jones, who was born in Atlanta, Georgia, added: “What’s also at play here is the changing face of the country and the kind of candidates that might represent the way the demographics are changing.” “If you go back to right before the 2008 election, Georgia was 53% white and Christian. Today it’s 41% white and Christian. Just between the beginning when Barack Obama was running and today, things have changed quite dramatically. It also has this urban-rural divide that so many states, particularly southern and peripheral south states, have: Atlanta and its suburbs versus the rest of the more rural state.” Just as she did in 2018, Abrams is likely to make voting rights a central issue. During that campaign, she highlighted serious election issues in Georgia, including the way the state was disproportionately flagging Black voters for potential removal from the rolls and a surge in polling place closures in the state. Now the stakes around voting rights are even higher. In March, Georgia Republicans enacted sweeping new voting restrictions, even though there was no evidence of fraud in the 2020 election. The new law gives voters less time to request an absentee ballot and requires them to provide information from a state ID on both the ballot request and ballot itself. It also limits the use of ballot drop boxes to one box per 100,000 voters, and only allows them to be in use during early voting hours. The boxes were used for the first time in 2020, when they proved popular and were available 24/7. The new law adds an additional day of Saturday early voting and makes Sunday early voting optional. Kemp has staunchly defended the measure, even as the state faced enormous pressure from Major League Baseball and other companies. The justice department and several other civic action groups are currently suing Georgia over the law. Helen Butler, a longtime organizer in Georgia, said she is already seeing the effects of the new voting law on the ground there. During municipal elections earlier this year, she said her group, the Georgia Coalition for the People’s Agenda, had seen an uptick in people who wanted rides to the polls because they were wary of using an absentee ballot. The new law also limited what kind of assistance her group could give voters with mail-in ballots, she said. “We’re tired of always seeing barriers put in place to us being able to exercise our right to vote. ” Events in Georgia will be closely watched elsewhere. Trump has endorsed more than 60 midterm candidates across the country, including several running against Republican incumbents. Some strategists fear he could sabotage his own party as it seeks to regain the House and Senate. Democrats, meanwhile, have tried to learn from Abrams’ ability to generate enthusiasm. Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta, said: “There is a very real story in Georgia about Stacey Abrams organising and finding the Democratic voters and getting what people to turn out and vote. It was a story that started well before the 2018 cycle.” “She’s going to want to try to continue to build on that momentum but what she’s facing is that Republicans know that’s what she’s doing. They are aware that she’s probably the best in the business at being able to get people to turn out to vote and they are going to match those efforts with their own get-out-their-own effort.”",News/US news,‘It’s having its moment’: Georgia to offer litmus test for Trump and Democrats,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/12/georgia-republicans-democrats-trump-midterms
12/12/2021,"When Oliver Postgate, the late maestro of children’s television programmes, first invited young viewers to travel with him “in our imaginations across the vast starry stretches of outer space”, he was introducing many of them to a lifeform they would never forget: the Clanger. These little pink, knitted, nozzle-nosed aliens, Postgate suggested, were really rather like us, living out their lives on the “small planet wrapped in clouds” they called home. Now it has emerged they were much more like us than we thought.  A new book put together by Postgate’s son, Daniel, is to make public the full scripts of the puzzling show for the first time and to confirm a rumour often dismissed as heresy: yes, the Clangers did use the odd profanity and actually spoke a language that was very close to our own. The strange swanee-whistle voices that entertained millions of children on the BBC show in the 1970s were actually noted down in a full and detailed screenplay, written out in English. “People have often wondered whether there was swearing,” said Postgate, who revived the show for a new generation in 2015. He is surprised, he said, by the idea the soundtrack of whistles could ever have been entirely improvised. “Some people don’t realise that the scripts were written in English. And those who do often speculate on whether a certain amount of bad language – swearing, to be blunt – had been slipped into their conversations.” The magical, intergalactic introduction to the show, written and voiced by Postgate, went on to draw viewers in “very close”, suggesting that they “look and listen very carefully”. Those children who did just that may well have noticed that the show’s fictional location, a “calm serene orb”, was inhabited by beings with a short temper. “It was a very much a 70s family,” said the Clanger creator’s son. “So they were a bit abrasive with each other. Nothing really bad, but you can’t get away with that so much now.” Those voicing the Clangers may not have used immersive acting techniques like the Method to get into character, but they did have to know what was being expressed. “Now fans of the show can look and see exactly what my dad had written for the Clangers to say. After all, you can’t just whistle away in any old nonsense. The whistlers have to know their motivation.” In addition, Postgate explained to the Observer, the more volatile dialogue for the Soup Dragon was also written down in the script by his father. The sounds made by the enigmatic Iron Chicken, however, were simply indicated by tone. “The Iron Chicken was more emotive. So they were either plaintive noises or enthusiastic.” Clangers: The Complete Scripts 1969 to 1974 is being published by the crowdfunded publishing house Unbound, and contains 27 scripts, alongside Oliver Postgate’s special musical notation for each episode. It also reproduces many of the original illustrations created by Postgate’s collaborator, Peter Firmin, and several sketches showing the evolution of the unique creatures on the show, including the Soup Dragon and the Froglets. It even reprints the knitting patterns for the original Clanger characters’ models. Postgate senior, who died in 2008, was also behind popular children’s shows Pogles’ Wood, Noggin the Nog, Ivor the Engine and Bagpuss. He once said in an interview that Major Clanger, when confronted with a door that would not open in an early episode, can be heard whistling the words: “Sod it, the bloody thing has stuck again.” At the time it was unclear if Postgate was merely teasing his audience, especially as he added that the nicer child would be more likely to hear the line as: “Oh dear, the silly thing’s not working properly.” The newly published scripts make it clear the ruder version was on the money. “My dad’s original intention was for the series to be shown without narration, so it would be left up to the viewer to decide what the Clangers were saying,” said Postgate. “Indeed, when Clangers was shown at a festival in Germany, he asked a German producer whether he could follow the story. ‘Of course! They are speaking perfect German!’ the producer said.” The book also details a minor Postgate scandal surrounding the Pogles. “I have included some new documents in the book that show how my dad and Peter presented their ideas. At first the BBC were quite casual and laissez-faire about what they did. Then they introduced the Pogle Witch and some children were terrified. After that the BBC wanted to be clear exactly what they were going to do. In effect, the Pogle Witch was banned.” Postgate also suspects his father drew on some intriguing sources in the show: “The series came out shortly after the release of David Bowie’s Space Oddity album. And clearly, space was in the air in those days, what with the lunar landings. It was a creative touchstone.” The family’s political legacy was also an inspiration. “My dad came from a strong socialist heritage,” said Postgate. “His grandfather was the Labour MP George Lansbury. Lansbury’s philosophy had a lasting influence and I think it’s apparent in his stories.” The Clangers were briefly drawn into this combative arena in a special one-off episode called Vote for Froglet, in which Postgate tried to persuade the planet’s residents of the virtues of the two-party system. After a snap election, with the Soup Dragon running on the “free soup for all” ticket, the Clangers were unconvinced and stuck with their enlightened autonomous collective. And what of that powerful opening sequence, with the camera tracking across the cosmos? Well, Postgate believes his father may have been inspired by the footage that opens one of Britain’s most celebrated films, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s A Matter of Life and Death. “I often wonder if he consciously reused the images and ideas that open that film. I would not be surprised. He shared a lot of Powell and Pressburger’s vision of Englishness – the pastoral idealism.”",Arts/Television & radio,‘They were a bit abrasive’: how kids’ TV Clangers secretly swore,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/12/how-kids-tv-clangers-secretly-swore-oliver-postgate-scripts
12/12/2021,"During the closing stages of Margaret Thatcher’s premiership, I said to the Conservative MP John Biffen: “I think Mrs Thatcher must be suffering.” This was surprising, coming from such a long-term critic of Thatcherism as myself, but so was the reply from Biffen, a former member of her cabinet and also, for years, her leader of the Commons. “Yes,” he replied, “but is she suffering enough?”  Biffen was strongly opposed to the poll tax – a proposal for local authority taxation which would apply the same rate to rich and poor – general opposition to which eventually contributed to Thatcher’s fall from power in 1990. Biffen was also MP for the Oswestry constituency, which later became North Shropshire. North Shropshire is in the news. A solid Conservative seat where there is going to be a byelection on Thursday as a result of the “sleaze”-enforced, if reluctant, resignation of Owen Paterson, but one which, according to the latest odds, the Liberal Democrats might win, given the way the public finally seems to be catching up with what an appalling government Boris Johnson has landed them with – Johnson, of course, being in the lead when it comes to the debasement of modern British political standards. Now, I did not get where I am today by making political forecasts, let alone following the betting. Nevertheless, byelections can spring surprises. There was an interesting one way back in 1985, when my then colleague Adam Raphael was covering the Brecon and Radnor byelection, which Neil Kinnock, then leader of the Labour party, had obviously hoped his candidate would win. Neil and Adam had a £10 bet on the result. But Labour’s support was dented by an incendiary speech by the National Union of Mineworkers’ leader, Arthur Scargill, and the seat went by a narrow margin to the Liberals. Neil paid up with a £10 cheque, which Adam did not cash, but instead framed for posterity. Alas, it turns out that the writing on the cheque has completely faded away. Posterity will have to take their word for it. If the North Shropshire byelection does produce an upset, this might well be the final nail in the coffin of Johnson’s troubled premiership. But whether this might benefit Labour is an open question. Kinnock and his deputy Roy Hattersley had reasonable hopes they would defeat Thatcher in a general election, but by ruthlessly dispensing with her in favour of John Major, the Tories got themselves a new lease of life. The good news is that Labour’s present leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has also had a new lease of life with his forensic assault on this frightful government. But we must wait to see whether he and Labour can turn up the heat on the disaster of Brexit. I was disappointed to read an article by Lionel Barber, former editor of the Financial Times, in which he said that he and some distinguished colleagues on the new Independent Commission on UK-EU Relations were united in the view that “there can be no question of refighting the Brexit referendum or reopening the question of EU membership. The war is over, the Leavers won.” This is desperately defeatist. They acknowledge that “Brexit isn’t working” then say “the task of the commission is to help fix it”. But Brexit can’t be “fixed”. As Kinnock recently observed: “You cannot mend a burst tyre.” Day by day the news gets worse: our so-called Brexit negotiator Lord Frost has alarmed the Biden administration with what his “renegotiation” of the Northern Ireland protocol might portend for peace in Northern Ireland, and he unashamedly wants to abandon the European social model – to which the UK, by way of having previously championed the single market, has made a major contribution. Frost and his colleagues fantasise about a trade deal with the US which is simply not on the cards. Trump-era tariffs on US imports of steel and aluminium? Down for members of the EU, but not for the UK. Pig farmers? Sheep farmers? Thousands of small and medium-sized British businesses? All suffering from the absurdity of Brexit. It is more than five years since 37% of the electorate voted for Brexit, in response to a number of grossly misleading promises. As I wrote recently, I ask many people I encounter what they think of Brexit, and the response is decidedly negative. As for the younger generation – the many people who have become eligible to vote since 2016 – my strong impression is that they are overwhelmingly in favour of rejoining. Labour should go for it!",News/Business,"Fighting byelections or Brexit, the rule is the same: don’t give up",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/12/fighting-byelections-or-brexit-the-rule-is-the-same-dont-give-up
12/12/2021,"CNN found itself at the center of the US news cycle this week, after its primetime host Chris Cuomo was abruptly fired for helping to shape the response of his brother, the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo to multiple accusations of sexual harassment. The younger sibling, 51, lost three jobs in as many days – as CNN host, Sirius satellite radio jock, and a contract for a book provisionally titled Deep Denial – and now faces an investigation by outside lawyers for CNN, while the elder Cuomo, 64, faces a justice department investigation stemming from a damning report issued by New York’s attorney general.  But the scandal has also placed CNN in the crosshairs after Cuomo accused his boss, network president Jeff Zucker, of knowing about his involvement in trying to manage his brother’s scandal. “There were no secrets about this, as other individuals besides Mr Cuomo can attest,” a Cuomo spokesman told the Wall Street Journal last weekend. The network hit back, calling the accusations “patently false” and illustrated why he had been fired “for violating our standards and practices, as well as his lack of candor”. CNN then announced it would resist paying out $18m remaining on Cuomo’s four-year contract, a deal that amounted to $25,000 a night for an hour-long primetime segment. Cuomo is understood to have hired LA attorney Bryan Freedman, and CNN is working with litigator Daniel Petrocelli. It was a remarkable end to what had always appeared a chummy relationship between the star and his employer, who had seemed firm in backing him. But CNN’s problems do not end there. Fellow star Don Lemon, whose primetime hour came after Cuomo’s, has been accused of sexual harassment in a bar three years ago. Lemon’s accuser, ex-bartender Dustin Hice, made the claims on the Megyn Kelly Show this week. Lemon also came up in the staged attack of Empire star Jussie Smollett, when the actor testified at trial that he received a text from Lemon warning him that his decision not to hand his phone records over to detectives had triggered an investigation. Until the moment of Cuomo’s termination from the cable news station, he and CNN had expressed a “family first, job second” rationale. “This was a very unique situation, and so we did allow for some leeway for Chris that, you know, was unique to that situation for somebody in that role with a brother in that role during a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic,” Zucker told a CNN town hall, reported The Wrap. Tanya Selvaratnum, one of four women who accused New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman of physical abuse, leading to Schneiderman’s resignation, says CNN’s efforts to keep the host on long after his involvement with his brother’s efforts to stay in office were interlocked. “These power structures in politics and the media have been designed to propagate misogyny and hierarchy,” Selvaratnum said. “Those at the top of the hierarchy, inherently characterized by white patriarchy, will stop at nothing to maintain their power until their wrongdoing is fully exposed – and even then they’ll try to hang on to it.” The interplay between politics and the media is hardly new, but represents a broader crisis for journalism in America, says Kyle Pope, editor-in-chief of the Columbia Journalism Review. “CNN benefited from the relationship between Andrew and Chris Cuomo during Covid lockdowns when they aired what were misguided, inappropriate, fawning interviews. CNN touted that, calling it great insight into a critical moment. For CNN to now claim they are shocked that those two were so intertwined is ridiculous.” But the larger question concerns to what extent US cable news has handed over its most viewed, and therefore profitable, hours over to political commentary. Once that was an issue that largely affected rightwing Fox News. Then left-leaning MSNBC. Now supposedly mainstream channels like CNN are at it. “Fox News was the first to really blur the lines between news and opinion, and it was not un-noticed that they became the most watched and the most profitable. They had this ridiculous fig leaf of being straight news during the day and at some magical moment we switch to something else. CNN and MSNBC then mimicked them,” said Pope. But, Pope pointed out, viewers don’t differentiate, and like everything else during the Trump era, everything became exaggerated. “I watched Fox on one side and CNN and MSNBC on the other became more and more opinionated as the presidency wore on, to the point that they could not pull themselves out.” And that, he said, is the case across TV and print. “You can ask the question: what’s driving what? Is it the country driving the polarization? Or is that opinion is cheaper to produce? Or is the news driving the polarization? Whatever it is, it’s clearly this is what’s happening.” “The fallback position of new organization of ‘well, it’s complicated’ is clearly a ridiculous journalistic response,” Pope said, which typifies news businesses’ response to Trump to brand themselves as identity-markers. “So it becomes very difficult from managers to say they screwed up because it plays right into the hands of the other guy.” Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and popular culture at Syracuse University, said the Cuomo saga is no more than another stop in the creation of a cable news star system. “It was a dangerous game for Fox, as it is now for CNN.” Thompson said that Chris Cuomo’s ratings began to collapse before his brother finally stepped down in early November, a sign perhaps that the brothers’ fortunes were closely linked. But the cable new channels have all seen precipitous drops in primetime viewers over the past year, with CNN down 77%, MSNBC 59%, and Fox News down 35%. According to ratings data compiled by Nielsen, Fox News recorded an average primetime audience of 2.6m viewers in November, followed by MSNBC with 1.1m, and CNN with 654,000. As CNN deliberates on Cuomo’s replacement, it might reflect on other times when a single show or personality has floated a network – the eras of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire or American Idol, or even Bill Cosby. “It’s the danger of single-crop planting. It’s fine until a certain weevil comes along,” Thompson pointed out. “Primetime news and primetime entertainment are all playing the same game – to maximize audiences.” The acceleration of news-opinion often gets laid at the door of Trump, who explicitly used CNN coverage as a bargaining chip to threaten Time-Warner’s tie-up with AT&T. “I don’t entirely blame CNN, but they certainly did become the anti-Fox,” said Jim Sleeper, a former lecturer in political science at Yale. In the post-Cuomo CNN era,will we see a continuation of primetime opinion or kick it back to cooler heads from the news division? “I think CNN might subtly retune to make it seem like they’re offering objective news,” Sleeper adds. But it is also possible – given the economic temptations of opinion as news as a ratings-grabber – that the reverse may happen as they look to replace Cuomo. The lessons of Tucker Carlson’s success at Fox News, where ever-increasing ratings has been rewarded with big audiences and growing power, seem obvious. “We got into a dynamic that’s caused real distress in the American news culture and traditions,” Sleeper said.",News/Media,CNN mess over Cuomo shows dangers of news-as-entertainment,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/12/cnn-chris-cuomo-news-media-infotainment
12/12/2021,"The Wonderland psychedelic business conference, held recently in Miami, Florida, drew large crowds and big-name keynote speakers – such as former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson – with the promise of a booming new sector. It is being suggested that the next big development in mental healthcare will come in the form of psychedelic drugs: substances such as psilocybin (magic mushrooms), ayahuasca (a plant-based mixture from South America), and DMT (a naturally occurring hallucinogenic). While these substances have been illegal and primarily associated with countercultures such as the hippies of the 1960s and ravers of the 1990s, changes in laws and scientific breakthroughs in psychedelic treatments for depression and anxiety have created a new industry projected to be worth £8bn by 2027.  Much as happened with the cannabis industry a decade ago, a culture clash is now developing between social justice activists who fought for the legalisation of psychedelics and wealthy white men, often new to the drugs, who have the resources to dominate an emerging industry. Two years ago in the US, the city of Denver voted to decriminalise psilocybin mushrooms. It was quickly followed by Oakland and Santa Cruz in California, the state of Oregon, and then Seattle, which added ayahuasca, ibogaine and non-peyote-derived mescaline to the list. Some of these campaigns enjoyed financial support from large companies such as the organic soap producer Dr Bronner’s. Celebrities including actors Megan Fox, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith and talk show host Chelsea Handler have testified to the psychologically transformative powers of a psychedelic trip. As the buzz around these drugs heralds a new industry, will those profiting maintain the countercultural ideals of the people who popularised the drugs? “This isn’t the 1960s all over again,” the former chief executive of MindMed, JR Rahn, told Forbes as his company was attempting to get approval from the FDA, the US regulator, for its specific types of LSD to treat anxiety. “I want nothing to do with those kinds of folks who want to decriminalise psychedelics.” Much of the effort to legalise such substances is centred on offsetting the damage that the “war on drugs” has caused in impoverished communities – often by promising people of colour an economic path into this new, lucrative industry. However, for many of the early investors in psychedelics who are able carry the legalisation baton to the finishing line, the strategy is often to craft a limited version of the industry that places them exclusively in charge. “The idea that psychedelics should only be used to heal something that is broken within you – rather than as a way to communally understand our world – is the narrow definition that will get FDA approval,” says Jason Ortiz, co-founder of the Minority Cannabis Business Association, and executive director of Students For Sensible Drug Policy. “That communal bonding will be lost if we’re only pressing it into pills.” Ortiz fears that if psychedelics fall exclusively into the hands of big pharma, plants often deemed sacred by Native Americans – and the surely lucrative industry awaiting them – will follow the same path as the legal marijuana industry. Legalisation here has seen the rich get richer, while minorities and psychedelic pioneers were left out in the cold. “There’s an institutionalisation of psychedelic drugs happening that will make them less accessible to the common person,” Ortiz says. “A lot of these corporations come from big pharma and have established networks within the FDA. Movements for justice threaten that monopoly by saying that folks should be able to cultivate, sell and consume these substances on their own.” Ortiz is pursuing decriminalisation for all psychedelics, allowing individuals to make their own choices about whether and how to take them. He views the pharmaceuticals industry as a threat to that. However, the chief executive of Enveric Biosciences in Florida, Joseph Tucker, says that to “do it the pharma way” will simply provide users with more confidence, a better experience and fewer side effects. He points to the synthesis of willow bark into aspirin in the 19th century – turning a traditional cure into a more effective, less toxic medicine. Enveric is creating psychedelic-derived molecules and synthetic cannabinoids for the treatment of mental health disorders, and is currently pursuing FDA approval for its products. “With psilocybin, there can be cardiotoxic effects if it’s taken every day, and there’s also serotonin syndrome [caused by excessive levels of the neurotransmitter in the body],” Tucker says. “But the biggest issues are with the trip itself. Bad trips rely on three major variables: dose, [mind]set and setting. So people try to really control the mindset and setting, and that constrains how you’re able to utilise those therapeutics. In many clinical trials, 90% of patients are screened out for having the wrong mindset, and so it won’t work for them.” Tucker points to ketamine – an anaesthetic that is often erroneously characterised as a psychedelic because of its history as a club drug – as an example of a drug with psychedelic effects that has been shown to be effective in mental health treatments, independent of therapy. Ketamine’s approval for “off-label” use, and its proven efficacy in treating depression and anxiety, has led to a number of clinics popping up across the US where those suffering can legally access it in a medically supervised environment. Elsewhere, the head of Los Angeles-based Irwin Naturals, Klee Irwin, says: “What I’ve done for 27 years is collect the best of what’s around and put it together into something accessible for all people. So I’ll take what indigenous people have discovered through some herbal concoction, and I’ll take it and put it into a bottle that you can get at Walmart.” As a publicly traded company and health supplement supplier for big US names such as Costco, Walgreens, CVS and Walmart, Irwin Naturals certainly has the track record to commercialise and legitimise psychedelics. In 2018, Irwin had to convince his more conservative investors that cannabis-derived CBD products were a smart, and not too risky, endeavour: he was proved right when the company became one of the largest CBD wholesalers in the nation. Before the Wonderland conference, Irwin made headlines by announcing that his company would be entering the markets for psychedelics and THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis. “I wouldn’t have been able to do this two years ago: it would’ve been too scary,” Irwin says. “But right now there’s this perfect quiet before the storm – an opportunity for us to slip in [to the psychedelics industry] as the first truly household-name brand, which can be viewed publicly as a validation of plant medicine. Soon it will be far less demonised and there’ll be a whole bunch of people dogpiling in just to make money.” Irwin distinguishes himself from those motivated exclusively by profit by his intention to keep prices low and thereby make the products accessible to all income groups. In this way, he feels the necessary social justice goals can be achieved via big business. “When we started selling CBD, we collapsed the pricing floor by selling it at half the price per milligram of the lowest-priced producer,” he says. “Since we are the largest, we can bully our competitors to chase us to the floor in terms of pricing, and we are about to do the same thing with marijuana.” Irwin sees the mental health crisis in America as an emergency that warrants an FDA fast-track for psychedelic drug approval – as was achieved with Covid vaccines. And he believes companies with the power to drive the prices down should do so as a public good. “There are around 600 ketamine clinics in the US, and they’re all mom-and-pop-owned, like video stores before Blockbuster,” Irwin says. “What we want to do is acquire some of them, and open up some new ones.” For psychedelics such as psilocybin and ayahuasca, which are not approved in America, Irwin is opening retreats in nearby countries such as Costa Rica and Jamaica, preparing his company for what he sees as inevitable drug-law shifts in the US. Ortiz of the Minority Cannabis Business Association says that, on the whole, large investments in the psychedelic industry are not inherently a bad thing so long as people of all levels of privilege have access to the substances, and the chance to enter the industry. “That will help dissolve the stigma around these substances, and there will be countless people who have their mental health issues addressed, and that’s a good thing for society in general. That being said, it’s important that it’s not solely owned by anyone.”",News/US news,‘This isn’t the 60s again’: psychedelics business takes off amid culture clash,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/12/psychedelics-industry-us-big-pharma
12/12/2021,"There’s a communal prayer of penitence that is often used in Church of England services. In it, worshippers confess that they have sinned against their fellow humans “in thought, and word, and deed; through negligence, through weakness, through our own deliberate fault”. Concise yet powerful, it recognises the different ways we can harm each other. Sins of omission and of carelessness are no less damaging, or requiring of forgiveness, than those born of malice. We live in a period when our personal contributions to systemic injustice, many of them unintentional, are becoming increasingly obvious. Our new age of enlightenment has illuminated any number of dark corners that society has long failed (or refused) to notice. Cricket, the sport I love, has just endured a particularly punishing month of reckoning. First, Azeem Rafiq’s public testimony against his former county, Yorkshire, forced the English game to admit that its anti-racism stance wasn’t worth the T-shirts it was printed on. Then, right before the Ashes, Australia’s then-captain admitted sending sexually explicit messages to a colleague. In both cases, players, coaches and commentators found themselves suddenly jobless, while the sport’s administrators have scrambled, with little dignity, to contain the fallout.  Rafiq said he had no interest in shaming individuals, but in exposing the culture of which their actions were a part. The fact that he was undermined with the revelation of antisemitic tweets from his past is symptomatic of our default position, to respond to calls for societal change with charges of hypocrisy. Each new sally in the culture wars requires its own forensic dig through social media. Each corresponding “Gotcha” moment detracts and distracts from the widespread need for justice, education and understanding that has inspired such powerful movements as Black Lives Matter and the #MeToo movement. Attitudinal and behavioural changes in our society are as rapid as they are overdue. Generations Z and Alpha will grow up with a far greater understanding than their predecessors of how insidious and widespread is the human instinct to “other” one another and how enshrined it is in our political systems and social networks. For anyone older, this is a time of reassessment. How many of us can honestly say we haven’t laughed at comedy based on stereotypes we’d blench at now, whether it’s our parents laughing at funny foreigners in 70s sitcoms or Rachel sniggering at the word “homo” in Friends? Given the insults that liberally littered schooldays past – girls calling each other “retards” or boys calling each other “gay” – who hasn’t used language they’d cringe to repeat or stayed silent at something they would quickly denounce today? No wonder many feel defensive, threatened, overwhelmed: having good intentions, and being decent in our individual encounters, is no longer enough. We’re living in an era when we’re being asked to listen and learn in ways that many of us haven’t done before. If it were easy to admit and apologise for our complicity in social “norms” that hurt others, we might have solved some of these problems. But even saying sorry for the smallest things can feel beyond us, especially under the scrutiny of social media that is quick to point the finger. While our first thoughts in these situations must be with the victims of injustice, it’s possible to feel horror for the discrimination they’ve endured (and we’ve ignored) yet retain an instinctive sympathy for those caught in the crude spotlight of their own errors. Perhaps that’s not an unselfish feeling. It’s born of the utter surety that some of our own past thoughts, beliefs and utterances might not withstand such scrutiny, whether or not our timelines are devoid of casually racist memes. Occasionally, it feels as though we’re living in a world of mutually assured destruction. There are few enough of us with clean hands, yet still, in our moral panic, we sacrifice our scapegoats and revel in other people’s downfalls. The more loudly we exercise our judgment on “historical messages” or thoughtless speech or crass attempts at humour, the harder it becomes for everyone else to own their mistakes. We can’t escape, and we can’t progress, if we’re trapped in a circle holding guns to each other’s heads. We have to find a new model for taking responsibility that tempers justice with mercy. We need to adopt a readiness to forgive that stops us getting so self-righteous and stoking divides. We must make space for grace. We also have to admit – to ourselves, to others – that we’re all susceptible to human nature and human flaws. Understanding how or why someone said or did something wrong, whether through deep-rooted and unchallenged prejudice or wilful ignorance, or worse, isn’t the same as condoning it. Acknowledging our mistakes and changing our behaviour is the most vital thing we can do. We’re more likely and able to make amends if we’re not terrified of lifelong judgment and if we don’t feel singled out for blame. In our secular society, we’ve let go of many of the rituals that allow us to acknowledge communal wrongdoing and encourage us to seek corporate forgiveness. Many would, understandably, choke on the hypocrisy of the absolution that religious establishments offer, when so many of them have been implicated in oppressive systems of their own. But maybe we’ve struggled to replace them with anything else that can recognise and relieve the heavy tonnage of our collective guilt. Instead, we point out the mote in our brother’s eye. Or we outsource atonement to actual corporations and other organisations we can hold accountable for actions and behaviour that exist at a safe distance. There’s surely a reason why the mea culpas doled out by PR departments these days have started to sound less like careful legalese and more like liturgy. “Our sport did not welcome you, our game did not accept you as it should have done,” intoned the ECB’s press release. It could almost have come with an amen at the end.

12/12/2021,"Boris Johnson is facing the most testing week of his troubled premiership as a mounting Tory rebellion over new Covid-19 restrictions threatens his authority in parliament and a supposedly safe Conservative seat appears on a knife-edge ahead of a byelection on Thursday. After a tumultuous week for the prime minister, which saw him having to apologise over the way his officials joked about a rule-busting Christmas party in Downing Street last year and deny that he had misled his own standards adviser over the refurbishment of his flat in Downing Street, even some of his most loyal supporters are now privately raising questions about his chances of leading the party into the next general election.  Tory MPs say potential successors to Johnson, including the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt are already gearing up for the possibility of a leadership contest in the new year and sounding out opinion in the party about levels of support. “Liz is the one with momentum,” said one former minister. “But Rishi is out there too. And Jeremy never gave up the campaign he ran in 2019.” Another very senior figure in the party said he suspected that Johnson was being set up for a fall by senior ministers who wanted him to be defeated over new Covid-19 rules, in the belief that this could fatally wound him. MPs will vote in the Commons on Tuesday on a range of Plan B measures that Johnson and his ministers have agreed are needed to slow the spread of the Omicron variant, which scientists now believe will overtake Delta as the dominant strain by the end of this month. Many Conservative MPs are furious about plans to make so-called vaccine passports mandatory for large venues. The proposals will mean those who have not been fully vaccinated, or cannot show a negative lateral flow test result, will not be able to enter indoor venues with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor venues with more than 4,000 people and any venue with more than 10,000 people from Wednesday. The plan B measures also include compulsory mask-wearing in most public indoor settings, as well as guidance for employees to work from home where they can to stem transmission. Some Tories believe that the measures were pushed by Johnson to deflect attention from the controversies engulfing Downing Street. Former Cabinet ministers David Davis, Esther McVey, Liam Fox and Greg Clark are among those to have voiced concerns about the scaling-up of restrictions. Clark, a former business secretary, said the government had “jumped the gun” by acting before more was known about the impact Omicron could have on hospital admissions. Between 50 and 80 Tory MPs are said to be considering voting against the government or abstaining, leaving Johnson potentially relying on Labour votes to get the measures approved by parliament. There are rumours of ministerial resignations unless the government shifts its ground. Labour has said it will back the measures, insisting it does not want Johnson to have to water down restrictions sought by the government’s own scientific and medical advisers. On Saturday night, the former cabinet minister Damian Green indicated he would not be supporting the government unless it could be shown that Omicron was a more lethal variant than its predecessor. He said: “If the government wants to convince people it needs to come up with some evidence that the Omicron variant is not just more transmissible than Delta but also that it is more dangerous.” Another leading backbencher said the numbers not supporting the government could even climb to over 100, which would be a severe dent in Johnson’s ability to hold his parliamentary party together. Another former minister told the Observer: “This is matter of principle for many of us. We were told that as a country we have to learn to live with this virus so can we not try to do rather than curtail people’s liberties?” On Wednesday, Johnson, whose wife, Carrie, had a baby daughter last week, is expected to appear before a tense end-of-term meeting of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers. Then on Thursday voters will go to the polls in a byelection in the supposedly safe Tory seat of North Shropshire, vacant after the resignation of Owen Paterson, who was found to have breached parliamentary lobbying rules. The Lib Dems are reporting this weekend that they have closed the gap with the Tories so the seat is now too close to call, as they pour activists into the constituency.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson faces hardest week in office as Conservative party tumult grows,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/12/boris-johnson-faces-hardest-week-in-office-as-conservative-party-tumult-grows
12/12/2021,"On 19 December last year Boris Johnson appeared in Downing Street to tell the nation more bad news about Covid-19 that would affect the plans of millions of people at Christmas. “Yesterday afternoon I was briefed on the latest data showing the virus spreading more rapidly in London and the south-east of England than would be expected,” he said. Reading from a script that, a year on, seems depressingly familiar, he said a new strain of Covid-19 (which would become known as the Alpha variant) was taking hold and was thought to be up to 70% more transmissible than the old one.  “We know enough already to be sure we must act now,” Johnson told the country. So grave was the situation that the PM had convened an urgent meeting of ministers on the Covid operations committee the previous evening to discuss the need for tough and deeply unwelcome new restrictions, including rules that would mean people in tier 4 areas could not mix with anyone outside their household – even on Christmas Day. On that same Friday evening when Johnson and his ministers met, however, the last thing on the minds of some members of his staff at Downing Street – and a favoured few across Whitehall departments – was a new variant or fresh Covid rules. Instead they were getting ready for some festive fun behind the big black door of No 10. In an area of Downing Street occupied by advisers and his press team, through which Johnson and his wife, Carrie, have to pass to get to their flat at the top of the building, several dozen officials gathered over the course of that evening for drinks, nibbles and party games at the end of another long week. It appears to have been a blatant breach of rules by people whose day job was to communicate the need for compliance to the nation. But this was the heart of power. “Most of them in there had had Covid. They had been ill. They thought somehow things didn’t apply to them,” said a senior government source. “I think they were just rather blasé. They called it the plague pit in there because it had ripped through the building. So they thought, well, we have been bloodied by it. What more can happen to us? But it was fucking stupid. It shows the arrogance. Put it out there with an invitation, and you are demarcating it as an event, for God’s sake.” When news of this and other alleged Downing Street “parties” first broke in the media at the end of November, the prime minister and his staff denied any wrongdoing. Johnson insisted that he had known nothing at the time and had been assured since that if a small get-together had happened, it had been fully compliant with rules in place at the time. There was nothing to worry about. But this weekend, when Johnson should be happily celebrating the birth on Thursday morning of his seventh child, a baby daughter, while preoccupying himself on the work front with a new emerging Covid crisis, the issue of “partygate” has blown up in his face and is consuming many in Downing Street. This, and other self-inflicted crises that call into question not just the prime minister’s judgment but his honesty and integrity, have coincided and fed off each other in a way that even some ministers sense now threatens his premiership, not least because, as one former minister put it: “We are talking about this bollocks instead of what matters, and it is happening again, again and again”. This weekend large sections of the Tory party are in total despair. Only a month ago it was the Owen Paterson affair, a catastrophic prime ministerial misjudgment which triggered weeks of Tory sleaze stories. It is the regularity of these disasters that incredibly has led some Conservative MPs to think, for the first time, about scenarios under which the man who won them an 80-strong majority two years ago might have to be thrown overboard. And all as yet another Covid variant, Omicron, surges across the UK, requiring public compliance and patience with another round of government restrictions at Christmas. To add to Johnson’s woes, a giant Tory rebellion looms over his latest package of Covid restrictions, due to be voted on in the Commons on Tuesday. “It is a total farce and a total disaster,” said one senior Tory MP. “How can we have authority as a party of government when the public see this hypocrisy going on? The party thing has really angered everyone and the timing is beyond awful. It is worse than Barnard Castle with my constituents. The next few days will be critical.” Wednesday was a truly terrible day for Boris Johnson, one of those when it seemed things simply could not get any worse for the PM. The evening before, ITV News had broadcast leaked footage in which Downing Street staff, including Allegra Stratton, the PM’s official spokesperson at the time, laughed about the hitherto flatly denied Christmas party, four days after it had clearly happened. Officials had been rehearsing with Stratton for planned broadcast press conferences (which then never happened because everyone concluded the idea would backfire) and wanted to see how she would react and what she would say if journalists ever found out. Ed Oldfield, who still works at No 10 as an adviser on broadcast media matters, was posing as a journalist and said he had heard that a Christmas party had taken place. What was the government response? Stratton was flummoxed, and laughed nervously before asking, “What’s the answer?” To guffaws in the room, she then offered that “this fictional party was a business meeting … and it was not socially distanced”. It was clear to the millions who saw the footage that the often denied event had most definitely taken place – and that everyone who knew about it feared that one day it would leak out. At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Johnson offered a grovelling, excruciating apology for the video and the way his staff had behaved. It was another hugely damaging U-turn. He said he was “appalled and sickened”, though he did not actually admit that the party had happened. That, he insisted, would be for the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, to establish in a new inquiry. Case would within hours widen that inquiry to include allegations about other parties, including one in Johnson’s own flat a year or so ago. Unlike at PMQs two weeks before, when many seats were left vacant as Tory MPs stayed away out of disgust at the Paterson disaster, this time they were packed in behind Johnson. But not to cheer him on. Rather, they looked on in deathly silence at the macabre events as Keir Starmer twisted the knife. The prime minister tried to inject some Covid vaccine bounce back into his backbenchers, talking about the government’s record on boosters, but the old tricks were falling flat. He was on his own amid a sea of morose faces. The reasons were more than just about the party. Before MPs had entered the chamber, strong rumours had been circulating that Johnson and his cabinet were about to do what they had suggested would not be necessary before Christmas, and order their Covid “plan B” to be implemented, meaning a return to tighter restrictions with vaccine passports in nightclubs, more mask-wearing and other new rules. And this as the row about non-compliance among Downing Street staff raged on. So cynical had even his own MPs become that the automatic suspicion of some was that new rules were an attempt to divert attention away from “partygate”. Tory MP William Wragg stood up and said as much: “Very few will be convinced by this diversionary tactic,” he told his leader, in an intervention that drew gasps from all sides. Outside the chamber, Tory MPs were in a state of open despair. One Johnson loyalist said he thought the PM could still rescue the situation, but added quickly that if he didn’t by early in the new year the party would show its ruthless streak. “Unlike Labour, we are good at getting rid of liabilities. If this goes on, we act.” What angered many was the backlash they were already feeling from their constituents. “The film about the party did it. That filled up my inbox overnight. Worse than anything I have had before. That was the trigger,” said a former minister. Something else had changed, almost overnight. Normally unexcitable Tory backbenchers were beginning to discuss life after Johnson and mull possible successors. Several talked about Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, being “on manoeuvres”, and Jeremy Hunt never having closed down his failed 2019 leadership bid. Some admitted writing, if not sending, letters of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee, as they toyed with attempting to trigger a leadership contest. “It’s not dated, but it’s sitting on my desk,” said one MP. It was the depressing cycle of crisis after crisis that had led him to put pen to paper. Were other letters being written? “I think the answer to that is undoubtedly yes. Whether it gets to the trigger figure this side of the new year, I’m not sure. But it’s end of empire stuff.” Several MPs said that Johnson’s weakness was all the greater because he lacked any die-in-the-ditch allies. “He has nobody who will stand for the last bit of hand-to-hand combat. He’s on the field alone. The emperor doesn’t have new clothes. He is just wandering around stark bollock naked,” observed another MP. “I’ve got members, my colleagues are saying they’ve got members, saying, ‘I voted for Johnson as I thought he was brilliant. I was duped. He’s a clown. He’s got to go.’” In midweek, Downing Street tried to get senior ministers on radio and TV to defend Johnson, but they all found excuses not to do so. Later on Wednesday afternoon, a tearful Stratton appeared outside her London home and announced her resignation, which Johnson accepted, presumably hoping that would at least restore some calm. But the next day – after Johnson had spent the night at a London hospital as his wife gave birth – the PM was having to deal with new and potentially even more serious issues about the way the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat had been paid for, at a cost of more than £100,000. The Electoral Commission ruled in a report that the Tory party had broken electoral law by failing to declare money given by Tory donor Lord Brownlow as a donation. The commission also mentioned a WhatsApp message that Johnson sent to Brownlow asking for money, months before Johnson said he first dealt with the peer on the matter. Johnson’s adviser on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt, who had investigated the refurbishment and cleared Johnson of wrongdoing was said to be furious and to have considered quitting. If he still does so, he will be the second standards chief under Johnson to have resigned because of the PM’s own behaviour. The adviser on parliamentary standards, Kathryn Stone, is now said to be considering launching her own investigation into the issue. “If Geidt goes I think that could be very serious indeed,” said a former cabinet minister on Saturday. Another well-placed MP said it was not impossible that Johnson, like Paterson, could be recommended for suspension from the Commons. This coming week will, most MPs believe, be a critical one for Johnson. On Tuesday, several dozen Tory MPs are threatening to rebel over the new Covid restrictions. Many believe the case has not been made that the Omicron variant requires such intervention, when there is scientific evidence to suggest that it only causes relatively mild disease. They also want Johnson to show that he meant it when he said the country needs to live with Covid-19. “It is a basic issue of principle,” one rebel said. “It’s about civil liberties.” Then on Thursday, voters go to the polls in what should be the safest of safe Tory seats in a byelection in North Shropshire caused by the resignation of Paterson, whose case started the whole downward spiral for Johnson. Sensing an unlikely electoral scalp, the Liberal Democrats have been flooding the constituency and were on course to have a record number of activists there this weekend. The party has made 37,000 “contact attempts” with constituency voters. A memo to staff from its chief executive on Friday revealed that, according to responses it had reviewed from voters who said they would cast a ballot on Thursday, the Tories – who enjoyed a 23,000 majority at the last election – now had a one-point poll lead. The Lib Dem projection puts the Tories on 40%, the Lib Dems on 39% and Labour on 12%, with Reform UK and the Greens on 4% each. As our Opinium poll shows today, support for Johnson is fast ebbing away. In just a few weeks, a comfortable Tory advantage has turned into a nine-point lead for Labour. One senior Tory MP said that in the current atmosphere he would not be surprised if his party lost. “Boris will be praying that we hang on, so he can get through to Christmas and then regroup. But there is a lot of anger out there. We thought he was an electoral asset. But this is the worst possible time for the Tory party led by Boris to be asking the electorate to keep the faith.”",News/Politics,Boris on the brink: how Johnson reached the edge of disaster,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/12/boris-johnson-on-the-brink-sleaze-partygate-covid
12/12/2021,"A person in New South Wales has been admitted to hospital infected with the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the first Omicron patient to be hospitalised since it arrived in Australia last month. It comes as thousands of protesters marched through capital cities on Sunday to oppose vaccine mandates, and Western Australia and Queensland prepared to reopen their borders.  After two years of border closures, the WA premier Mark McGowan is on Monday due to announce when the state’s borders will reopen to domestic and international travellers, after reaching the 80% vaccination milestone over the weekend. And “tens of thousands” of people are expected to cross into Queensland after its borders reopen at 1am on Monday. It will be the first time in 229 days people will not need to quarantine on arrival, provided they are fully vaccinated. Police have urged patience from travellers. “It’s been very, very difficult to estimate but I could safely say anywhere between 20 and 40 or 50,000 additional vehicles,” commissioner Katarina Carroll said. “We don’t know exactly whether people would be coming immediately or will delay the trip for a couple of days.” Carroll urged people wanting to visit Queensland from 13 December to travel outside peak hours, and said they should expect significant delays. Queensland reported one overseas case of Covid-19 on Sunday – a man in his 30s who arrived from Nigeria. Health authorities are monitoring the genomic sequencing of his infection to see if it is the Omicron variant. The Queensland treasurer Cameron Dick said it was “very good news” only one case had been detected, but warned the border reopening meant the days of very low infection numbers “won’t last”. The federal government on Sunday announced it would cut the waiting time for Covid-19 vaccine booster shots from six months to five under a plan to counter the spread of the new strain. Evidence from the UK says the spread of Omicron appears to be doubling every two to three days in that country. Prof Neil Ferguson, a member of the UK government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said while Omicron currently only represented 2%-3% of new infections, it was likely to be the dominant strain across the UK by the end of the year. “It’s likely to overtake Delta before Christmas at this rate,” he said, adding it could be necessary to impose new lockdowns as a result. NSW recorded 10 new cases of Omicron in the 24 hours to 8pm Saturday night – still only a fraction of the 485 new cases recorded. That brings to 55 the total number of Omicron cases in the state. A confirmed Omicron case visited the Argyle House nightclub in Newcastle on 8 December. That case is linked to an earlier outbreak on a party boat cruise on Sydney Harbour a week earlier. In Victoria, there were no new confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in the past 24 hours. There remain three confirmed cases in total. Genomic sequencing is also under way to confirm the variant for seven other probable Omicron cases who have tested positive for Covid-19. The federal government said its decision to bring forward the timeframe for fully vaccinated people to get their booster vaccination from six months to five was motivated by the rapid global spread of Omicron. “We do believe that boosters are going to be much more important … to give that extra immunity, particularly as the Omicron variant is likely to spread around the world,” the federal health department secretary, Brendan Murphy, said. Meanwhile, Victoria will no longer require hotel quarantine for fully vaccinated travellers from the nine southern African countries previously identified as of concern over Omicron – South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Malawi, and Mozambique. Travellers arriving from those countries will follow the rules applying to travellers arriving from other countries. Protesters again gathered at Victorian parliament in Melbourne on Sunday afternoon, chanting “free Victoria” before marching down Bourke Street. In Sydney, thousands gathered at Hyde Park to rally against vaccine mandates for a range of workplaces. The protests were part of a national day of action across the country, with demonstrations also in Queensland, Perth, Canberra, Adelaide and Hobart",News/Australia news,Omicron patient hospitalised in NSW as Queensland prepares for thousands of cars to cross border,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/12/omicron-patient-hospitalised-in-nsw-as-queensland-prepares-for-thousands-of-cars-to-cross-border
12/12/2021,"During 20 years of war in Afghanistan, according to the US-based Watson Institute’s Costs of War Project, about 176,000 people were killed, of whom 46,000 were civilians. Dreadful though they are, these figures are dwarfed by predictions by the World Health Organization that 1 million Afghan children under five will die of starvation this winter. Another 2.2 million will suffer acute malnutrition – unless urgent action is taken. Relief organisations have warned for months of an impending humanitarian catastrophe. Now the catastrophe has arrived. “Hunger in the country has reached truly unprecedented levels,” the UN refugee agency said on 3 December. “Nearly 23 million people – that is 55% of the population – are facing extreme levels of hunger and nearly 9 million of them are at risk of famine.”  If the international community, and especially the US and Britain, which abandoned the country in August, is to prevent, or even mitigate, this coming disaster, it must act now. Some emergency aid has been supplied since the Taliban took power in Kabul, but nowhere near enough. A Marshall Plan for Afghanistan is required. Many crises are converging. The war and its aftermath have left 3.5 million people displaced. They are particularly vulnerable. Foreign assistance, amounting to 75% of all public spending, has halted. Teachers, health professionals and civil servants have not been paid for months. As Covid rages, a drought has caused harvests to fail. While Taliban commanders direct scant resources towards feeding and paying their fighters, the economy has seized up. The banking system is breaking down, cash and savings are hard to access, prices are rising. Per capita annual income is forecast to drop next year from $509 (£380) to $350 (£260). These are starvation wages. Meanwhile, the US Treasury and IMF have frozen $9.5bn of Afghan assets. According to the Costs of War Project, the US has spent $2.3tn in Afghanistan since 2001. Yet direct and indirect gains, such as healthcare provision, schooling for girls and integration of women into the workforce, are being squandered, mainly due to the Taliban’s feudal attitudes but also for lack of continued western support. This self-defeating regression threatens to rebound on the west. Analysts suggest Europe could face a huge new refugee crisis next spring. Last week, 15 EU states agreed to take in 40,000 Afghans. This is welcome, but it’s a drop in the ocean. Wealthy countries, and Priti Patel’s flailing Home Office, must do more, better, quickly. The main reasons for western governments’ reluctance to step back in – fear of validating Taliban rule and misuse of donor funds – remain valid. Yet given the urgency of the crisis, ways around this political roadblock must be found. Proposed measures to ease UN sanctions, waivers for relief agencies, cash transfers via private banks and the unfreezing of individuals’ assets should be pursued. A longer-term international assistance strategy must be formulated. In Britain, much attention remains focused on August’s evacuation debacle. Concerns about the Foreign Office’s failure to adequately respond to Afghans’ emailed pleas for help, first reported in the Observer, and the negligent performance of then foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, have been compounded by a whistleblower’s revelations painting a picture of endemic incompetence. Raphael Marshall, who has since resigned his Foreign Office job, confirmed the impression that Raab was out of his depth. It’s surprising and disappointing that he is still in government and it’s dismaying that his successor, Liz Truss, appears to be as much interested in advancing her Tory leadership ambitions as she is in helping Afghans. By invading Afghanistan, Britain and the US began a fight they could not finish. By leaving in a panic, they precipitated another disaster. If they are to prevent a third catastrophe, as they should, they must hurry to the aid of the starving Afghan people – immediately, generously and without further prevarication.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/12/the-observer-view-on-the-humanitarian-crisis-facing-afghanistan
12/12/2021,"The skin on our hands is quite fragile and constant washing and exposure to the elements really puts it through its paces – which is why we are all battling stressed, cracked, dry hands. Regular use of a decent hand cream will rectify this. Some body lotions and creams double up as great hand creams, but these are few and far between. They’re also cumbersome. You need something that travels easily because, in this case certainly, size matters. So what else makes a good hand cream? It should have longevity; you shouldn’t have to apply 10 times a day. It should absorb into your skin as opposed to languishing lazily on the surface. It should be intensely moisturising, but not greasy – if, post-application, your fingers stick to everything, that is a fail. The range here ticks all these boxes and more. If you are looking for something heavy duty and pragmatic for very dry and/or sensitive skin, Eucerin, Aveeno and Kiehl’s are great and widely available, as is the shea butter-infused L’Occitane classic. Fan of Glossier’s You fragrance? Think of its fast-absorbing hand cream as its lightly scented cousin. Margaret Dabbs and Kat Burki are excellent for mature skins. For some fancy stocking-filler material, look no further than Byredo, Chanel and Aesop. Whatever the case, just get some hand cream; it’ll stop your hands ageing quicker than the rest of you. 1.
