2/13/2022,"Central banks are getting twitchy about inflation. Cost of living pressures are rising just about everywhere and the relaxed mood of last autumn has been replaced by an urgency that could soon become panic. In the US, where inflation is at its highest in four decades, the latest chatter on Wall Street is that the Federal Reserve will take every opportunity to raise interest rates between now and the end of the year, seven times in all.  Inflation figures for the UK are out on Wednesday, and even though little change is expected this month from the 5.4% recorded in December, further increases are expected by the spring. Bank of England forecasts should be taken with a pinch of salt because they have been wrong for the past year, but for what it’s worth Threadneedle Street now predicts inflation to peak at just over 7%. The Bank of England and the Fed are now getting stick for waiting so long before taking steps to rein in inflation. The US and the UK economies, it is said, are overheating as the threat from the pandemic recedes, one reason being that central banks have delayed putting up borrowing costs. This might seem a compelling argument but the idea that the US, the UK and the big economies of the eurozone are in the middle of a rampant boom doesn’t square with the facts. The fastest growing G7 economy over the past two years has been the US, where output has increased by 1.5% on average. The next best performing country has been France, where growth has averaged less than 0.5% a year. UK output is 0.4% below its pre-pandemic level, while Germany and Italy have still more ground to make up. So where is the inflation coming from? The answer is that prices are rising more quickly than they were because of supply-side pressures. As economies lifted restrictions and demand has returned to more normal – although not boom – conditions, severe bottlenecks have emerged. Everything from computer chips to natural gas has been in short supply, and that has pushed up inflation. This was the explanation the Fed and the Bank of England trotted out last summer and autumn when price pressures first started to bite, and it was broadly right. Yes, they said, interest rates would need to be raised from their emergency levels but there was no great urgency because their economies were still operating short of where they would have been in the absence of Covid-19. In any event, increasing the cost of borrowing would have zero impact on global energy prices. The Bank of England had an additional problem, which was that Rishi Sunak removed some of the support the Treasury was providing for the economy last autumn. With the benefit of hindsight, the end of the furlough did not lead to the feared rise in unemployment, but there was no way of knowing that at the time. As a result, the Bank’s monetary policy committee responded to the chancellor’s tightening of policy by keeping interest rates lower than they might otherwise have been. As the National Institute for Economic and Social Research pointed out last week, it would have been preferable had policy been the other way round, with a less aggressive approach by Sunak providing space for the Bank to raise rates modestly. The Bank of England and the Fed subsequently realised price pressures were more acute than they had predicted, while unemployment fell more quickly. This raised concerns that workers would use the bargaining power provided by a tight labour market to secure higher pay awards. If, say, an annual inflation rate of 7.5% in the US led to salary increases of 8%, a wage-price spiral redolent of the 1970s would then set in. In the short-term inflationary pressures are likely to persist. The first three months of 2022 will be an echo of last summer as restrictions are lifted and economies open up. Those people who have built up savings during lockdown now have cash to spare to buy a new car or book a foreign holiday. Firms will have trouble filling vacancies, while energy costs will remain high as long as there is a threat of Ukraine being invaded. The cost of a barrel of oil is already closing in on $100. Things look a lot trickier from the spring onwards. In the UK energy bills and taxes both go up in April, and it will become clear to many workers that their wages are not keeping up with inflation. Cost increases that were initially inflationary will turn deflationary as they add to costs for business and squeeze consumer spending power. Against this backdrop, the Bank of England needs to calibrate its response carefully (as does the Fed). Central banks clearly feel their credibility will be at risk if they allow inflation to take hold, and that means a more aggressive approach to interest rates than seemed likely as recently as late last year. And there is a way that central banks can emerge with their credibility intact. If they are right in believing inflation is currently a supply-side problem, only a limited tightening of policy will be needed. Inflation will come down with only a small increase in unemployment. The Bank and the Fed will then be the heroes of the hour. There is, of course, an alternative scenario in which central banks act tough but still damage their credibility, which is what will happen if they add to the pain already coming the way of their economies through interest-rate overkill. The growing risk of that would quickly turn the recovery of early 2022 into the recession of early 2023.",News/Business,Central banks should be cautious in calibrating a response to inflation | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/13/central-banks-should-be-cautious-in-calibrating-a-response-to-inflation
2/13/2022,"How do you repent an action that has ripped up someone’s life entirely? Carey Crim’s gut-wrenching play is a visceral interrogation of the lasting effects and consequences of rape. Weighty and forceful, it asks how life can continue after panoramic trauma. The interracial lesbian couple, Allison (Flora Montgomery) and Nadine (Amanda Bright) have successfully given Allison’s 20-year-old daughter, Eleanor (Meaghan Martin), the happiest possible childhood. But, now she’s announced her desire to find her father, their attempts to navigate the difficulties of parenting are set to come unwound. Long protesting that Eleanor was a product of a one-night-stand, and her only sexual experience with a man, Allison is forced to acknowledge head-on the years of suffering she has secreted.  Montgomery gives a seismic performance as Allison. Sustaining a balance of composure and agony, after a half-hearted explanation from Eleanor’s father where he reasons he was “too drunk” to remember the events of a college frat party, she spits back that he raped her. Not once doubting his culpability, the audience shares her tears as she comes face to face with him for the first time. Despite a stretched-out beginning, once Eleanor’s father’s identity has been revealed, it hangs, dominant over the drama. Directed by Katharine Farmer, the stillness of the early home scenes knot into manic disintegration. Mid-panic attack Eleanor begins to question her existence; “Did you ever regret having me?” she breathes. Her mother’s response: “Never, not once,” closes the brutal 90 minutes. Left with questions over the shape of this family’s future, as the three women circle each other we are given hope they’ll find a way to survive.

2/13/2022,"Today in a nutshell: Actual real snow arrived suddenly in Beijing and disrupted events Next up: There is still some curling and ice hockey to come today. Tomorrow we will get the rescheduled freeski slopestyle qualification with Eileen Gu, and the medals in the ice dance competition  One of the criticism’s of hosting the Winter Olympics in Beijing has been the negative environmental impact of the Games’ reliance on artificial snow. Well, not today at the men’s 4x10km cross-country relay, where the real-thing hampered the athletes – and the spectators – as the Russian Olympics Committee (ROC) team won a pretty slow race in difficult conditions. To put it into context, a winning time of 1:54:50 was over 20 minutes slower than the equivalent race at PyeongChang in 2018. Norway were second, France third, on a gruelling course that includes 400m of climbing in the 10km. Rather them than me. The snow also disrupted events elsewhere, with Eileen Gu’s much anticipated qualifying run in the freeski slopestyle postponed. Organisers said the storm had left too much loose snow on the freestyle course and that in order to ensure the safety of athletes, they decided to postpone the events. The second training session for the women’s downhill race was cancelled, but the men’s alpine skiing giant slalom went ahead with delays. “Definitely, the light is more than skiable, it just makes it difficult. I like it,” Norway’s Henrik Kristoffersen said after his first run. Jamaica’s Benjamin Alexander put it more succinctly at the end of one of his runs, as he was caught on camera saying “Frickin’ hell, that was hard!” The gold eventually went to Switzerland’s Marco Odermatt who finished with a combined time of 2:09:35, putting him 0.19 seconds ahead of Slovenia’s Zan Kranjec. Saudi Arabia’s Fayik Abdi, his nation’s first ever Winter Olympian, finished 44th, two places ahead of Alexander. Richardson Viano, the first person to ever represent Haiti at a Winter Olympics, did not finish his first run. Indoors and away from the elements, victories for both the British men and British women in the curling this morning have got their campaigns truly back on track. Sweden top the men’s round robin table at the moment, unbeaten after five matches. Great Britain and Switzerland are joint second with three wins and one defeat each. Team GB’s men face a Denmark team yet to win in the evening match. Switzerland are unbeaten in the women’s contest. Japan, Great Britain, Sweden and the US are also in the hunt for semi-final places. Marte Olsbu Roeiseland took the gold in the women’s 10km pursuit biathlon. It is her third gold of the Games so far, and she still has the 12.5km mass start race on Saturday to go. The play-off and quarter-finals brackets in the men’s ice hockey will be finalised today. At the time of writing, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) are the only team guaranteed a quarter-final slot. Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland, Latvia and China are all destined for the play-offs. Finland will advance automatically as the winner of Group C after a remarkable 4-3 win over Sweden, who blew a 3-0 lead at the end of the second period and lost in overtime! Jaclyn Narracott took Australia’s first ever medal in skeleton, finishing second behind Hannah Neise of Germany. “Indescribable, unbelievable, surreal,” Narracott said in an interview with Channel Seven. “It’s just everything that I’ve dreamt of. And to actually realise it ... it’s going to take a while to sink in. I would love this to be the catalyst to get more girls back into our sport. There’s no reason why we can’t be competitive at every Olympics and every World Cup.” Australia now have a record medal haul for a Winter Olympics … but Team GB face the real prospect of going home empty-handed. Slalom gold medalist Petra Vlhova is leaving the Beijing Olympics early due to an inflamed left ankle tendon and will miss the Alpine combined event where she had another medal chance. Marius Lindvik won a thrilling super-massive-enormous-gigantic hill ski jumping competition for Norway yesterday, stopping Japan’s Ryoyu Kobayashi making it a double gold with an incredible second jump of 140m. Kaillie Humphries of the US leads the first ever women’s monobob after the the first two heats earlier today. It is a brand new event introduced for women only. Humphries went just over a second faster than her nearest rival, Canada’s Christine de Bruin. She said “I know what it means to represent the United States. I’m so proud and honoured to be able to be here because nothing in life is guaranteed.” Times are all in local Beijing time.

2/13/2022,"Northern Ireland’s Stormont assembly faces collapse “forever” because of Democratic Unionist tactics, a rival party leader has warned. Only a year after-power sharing was restored following a three-year hiatus, Doug Beattie, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said the DUP’s decision to resign from the first minister role 10 days ago, combined with its veiled threats not to return to power-sharing unless the UK government meets its Brexit protocol demands, is putting democratic institutions at risk permanently.  Northern Ireland faces one of its most transformative elections on 5 May, with opinion polls projecting Sinn Féin will overtake the DUP as the largest party in Stormont. Beattie fears the DUP is signalling it will refuse to share power if it is returned as the second largest party, and is using the protocol as an early excuse. This is despite the party knowing “the protocol will still be there” after the elections, because the Conservatives have made clear it is not being scrapped. “Stormont will be gone if Sinn Féin come back as the largest party and the DUP second. It will be gone forever,” said Beattie. “The UK government and Northern Ireland Office are being dragged around by the scruff of the neck by the DUP. “They are creating divisive politics and until somebody stands up to them and says ‘no, you can’t do this, it’s not going to end well. And that’s what’s happening here,” he adds. It comes as the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said all unionists parties should give a commitment that they would nominate ministers in the event of Sinn Féin becoming the largest party after the next election. The UUP has refused to give a public commitment, but is unlikely to be in a position to take the deputy role. Beattie’s party is on 14% in the polls, in joint-third position with the Alliance party, while the DUP stands at 17%. The DUP has repeatedly refused to say whether it would accept the office of deputy first minister, a sign of things to come if Sinn Féin is victoriious, critics believe. Legally, under the Good Friday agreement the deputy first minister role is equal to first minister with parties sharing power at the top equally. Last week, the DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, gave the electorate another glimpse of its strategy, warning it would be “difficult” to return to Stormont if the protocol was not resolved by the elections, remarks that horrified rivals. Speaking from his offices in Portadown, Beattie accused Boris Johnson of being part of what he believes is naked electioneering. “The UK government had the opportunity to legislate to make the first minister and deputy minister equal in name. They chose not to. They are both gambling with Northern Ireland. It is beyond reckless,” he said. Beattie has cast his party as a more liberal and progressive than his rivals, but is as opposed to the protocol as the DUP. However, Beattie believes his party respects democracy. He said: “The difference between us and the DUP is we’ re not willing to collapse institutions to do something that we can do through dialogue and engagement and speaking to people.” The UUP has presented the Tories and the EU with a five-point blueprint to fix the protocol. It also wants to see Stormont’s rolling vote on keeping or ditching the protocol scrapped, as well astackling the role of the European court of justice and the “democratic deficit” that leaves Northern Ireland with no say on potential new laws coming out of the EU. However, he does not trust Johnson’s repeated promises to deliver on fixing the protocol. “I do not trust him a jot. He’s all rhetoric and soundbites. I don’t dislike him personally, but he is just not connected. I don’t think he’s a good prime minister,” said Beattie. He said he had faith in Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, but asked “what on earth was Johnson doing giving her the Brexit role” when she had to deal with Ukraine and China.",News/Politics,"Stormont ‘could disappear forever’, says Ulster Unionist leader",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/13/stormont-could-disappear-forever-says-ulster-unionist-leader-doug-beattie
2/13/2022,"Plans to make pornography websites carry out age checks are a “privacy minefield” thatcould lead to a digital ID system for accessing the internet, privacy campaigners have warned. Ministers confirmed this week that social media sites hosting large amounts of pornographic material, such as Twitter and Reddit, would also have to work under the same age-verification rules as adult content sites. It means the sites would have to introduce systems to remove adult material in the UK, or introduce age checks to determine whether users are over 18.  The proposed changes to the online safety bill were targeted primarily at commercial pornography publishers, but privacy groups have warned that the move could establish the principle of age-gating across the internet. Big Brother Watch, a privacy campaign group, said the new age verification policy was a “privacy minefield”. Mark Johnson, legal and policy officer at Big Brother Watch, said the proposed amendment to the legislation could pave the way for a digital ID system for the internet. He said: “The online safety bill presents a clear attempt to age-gate the internet. This new announcement could lead to a new digital ID system for the internet more widely, even for sites like Twitter. This would be devastating for free expression and privacy and would inevitably result in digital exclusion.” Privacy campaigners are concerned that stringent age verification procedures will discriminate against people who wish to remain anonymous online, while requiring people to log in to commercial porn sites could expose them to the threat of blackmail or having their careers destroyed. Open Rights Group, which campaigns for privacy and free speech online, said there was “absolutely no question” that children should be protected from harmful content – but the changes would expose internet users to surveillance and discrimination. Mariano delli Santi, the legal and policy officer at Open Rights Group, said: “While the government argues that this is about porn websites, what is being proposed is a generalised duty to verify internet viewers’ age on websites and services with user-to-user content. This brings into scope not only pornographic websites but also search engines, social medias, blogs and almost the entirety of the internet as we know it.” Large sums of money have been invested in British age verification companies, with pornography age checks often perceived to be the vanguard that leads towards wider scrutiny for all sorts of sites and uses. If the British model is then copied elsewhere in the world, it could mean a boon for the businesses that make it work in the UK. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said claims that the internet would be “age-gated” showed a misunderstanding of the bill, which could be presented to parliament in an updated form within weeks. “We are not ‘age-gating’ the internet and this is a misunderstanding of how the bill will work. In-scope platforms will have a duty to protect children from harmful content, such as pornography, but those which do not pose a risk to children will not have the same duties,” said the spokesperson. “The bill does not mandate the use of specific technologies to uphold these duties, but age verification methods used by firms will have to be secure, effective and protect people’s privacy. The regulator Ofcom will hold them to account.” Under the bill, companies that fail to implement robust age checks face the threat of a fine of up to 10% of their global revenue or having their site blocked in the UK. Businesses that publish commercial pornography online will be required to tell Ofcom, the communications regulator, how they plan to verify users’ ages and the watchdog will either approve the measures or ask companies to introduce tougher methods. Beeban Kidron, the crossbench peer behind the Age Appropriate Design Code, which requires internet sites to protect children’s data online, said privacy was “at the heart” of protecting children but said parents were “desperately calling” for better protection of children online. She said: “It is crucial is that the statutory guidance on age checking that will accompany the restrictions on sites hosting pornography and other age restricted services are privacy preserving. Only through such a robust set of standards will we be able to ensure that any age check system, whatever the technological approach, is private, secure, clearly defined – and establishes age not identity. Nothing less will do.”",News/Media,"Plans for age checks on porn sites ‘a privacy minefield’, campaigners warn",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/13/plans-for-age-checks-on-porn-sites-a-privacy-minefield-campaigners-warn
2/13/2022,"Didier Drogba has backed Romelu Lukaku to move on from his struggles on and off the pitch after the £97.5m striker played a key role in Chelsea becoming world champions for the first time. Lukaku has not looked settled since leaving Internazionale last summer, and upset Thomas Tuchel after airing his unhappiness with life at Stamford Bridge during an unauthorised interview with Sky Italia earlier this season. The Belgian’s comments did not go down well with his manager and he was under pressure to raise his level when Chelsea flew to Abu Dhabi to play in the Club World Cup.  Encouragingly, there were signs of an improvement in the Middle East. Lukaku scored the winner when Chelsea beat Al Hilal in the last four on Wednesday and he opened the scoring with a fine header as the European champions saw off Palmeiras in Saturday’s final. The goal was Lukaku at his best and Drogba, who was instrumental in Chelsea winning the Champions League in 2012, is confident that the 28-year-old can put his infamous interview behind him. “He took his responsibility to talk and put a bit more pressure on himself and delivered tonight, scoring an important goal,” the former Chelsea striker said after watching his old club lift the trophy at the Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium. “Every player always has something to prove and will always want to do better but hescored the goal to give us the lead and I’m happy with this performance.” Drogba is able to offer a good insight into the former Inter striker’s difficulties. The Ivorian was often outspoken during his playing career and was Chelsea’s main man when they first brought Lukaku to England in the summer of 2011. It is not easy to lead the line for Chelsea. Lukaku made little impact during his first spell at Stamford Bridge and expectations were high when he returned to west London last summer, but he has been unable to help Tuchel’s side challenge for the title. “He put himself under a certain pressure because coming back to the club where you start was difficult, and you come back because you want to prove a point,” Drogba said. “But he’s winning and I think he’s going to make it.” Drogba also revealed that he offers advice to Lukaku, who has only scored 10 goals in all competitions this season. “I hope he learned from me,” Drogba said. “He’s a goalscorer. He’s having a difficult moment, but bouncing back [and] this kind of trophy will bring his confidence back. “When we have the time to speak I give him some advice, but after that it’s his career, it’s his responsibilities now. It’s him now. He’s in charge of the attacking players, so he has to find the ideas and make it his own story.” Chelsea needed a late penalty from Kai Havertz to see off Palmeiras in extra time. They found it difficult against the Copa Libertadores champions, but Drogba was delighted that Chelsea have finally won every major trophy under Roman Abramovich. “That was the ambition when I joined the club in 2004,” he said. “We started by winning the League, the FA Cup, the Carling Cup. The goal was to win trophies, but also to inspire the next generations. They knew how important this was for the club. Now I’m here and I’m celebrating with them as well.” Chelsea’s focus now will be on a successful end to the season. They have faltered in the league of late and lie third in the Premier League, 16 points behind leaders Manchester City. Tuchel has now won three trophies since his appointment last year, though, and is popular with the club’s board. The club hierarchy believe that the disruption caused by Covid-19 dented Chelsea’a title push and they are fully behind Tuchel. The team face Lille in the last 16 of the Champions League next week and meet Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final at the end of this month.",Sport/Football,Didier Drogba backs Romelu Lukaku to put troubles behind him at Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/13/chelsea-dider-drogba-romelu-lukaku-club-world-cup
2/13/2022,"How do couples meet and fall in love in the 21st century? It is a question that sociologist Dr Marie Bergström has spent a long time pondering. “Online dating is changing the way we think about love,” she says. “One idea that has been really strong in the past – certainly in Hollywood movies – is that love is something you can bump into, unexpectedly, during a random encounter.” Another strong narrative is the idea that “love is blind, that a princess can fall in love with a peasant and love can cross social boundaries. But that is seriously challenged when you’re online dating, because it’s so obvious to everyone that you have search criteria. You’re not bumping into love – you’re searching for it.” Falling in love today tracks a different trajectory. “There is a third narrative about love – this idea that there’s someone out there for you, someone made for you, a soulmate,” says Bergström. “And you just need to find that person.” That idea is very compatible with online dating. “It pushes you to be proactive – to go and search for this person. You shouldn’t just sit at home and wait for this person.”  As a result, the way we think about love – the way we depict it in films and books, the way we imagine that love works – is changing. “There is much more focus on the idea of a soulmate. And other ideas of love are fading away,” says Bergström, whose controversial French book on the subject, The New Laws of Love, has recently been published in English for the first time. Instead of meeting a partner through friends, colleagues or acquaintances, dating is often now a private, compartmentalised activity that is deliberately carried out away from prying eyes in an entirely disconnected, separate social sphere, she says. “Online dating makes it much more private. It’s a fundamental change and a key element that explains why people go on online dating platforms and what they do there – what kind of relationships come out of it.” Take Lucie, 22, a student who is interviewed in the book. “There are people I could have matched with but when I saw we had so many mutual acquaintances, I said no. It immediately deters me, because I know that whatever happens between us might not stay between us. And even at the relationship level, I don’t know if it’s healthy to have so many friends in common.” It’s stories like these about the separation of dating from other parts of life that Bergström increasingly uncovered in exploring themes for her book. A researcher at the French Institute for Demographic Studies in Paris, she spent 13 years between 2007 and 2020 researching European and North American online dating platforms and conducting interviews with their users and founders. Unusually, she also managed to gain access to the anonymised user data collected by the platforms themselves. She argues that the nature of dating has been fundamentally transformed by online platforms. “In the western world, courtship has always been tied up and very closely associated with ordinary social activities, like leisure, work, school or parties. There has never been a specifically dedicated place for dating.” In the past, using, for example, a personal ad to find a partner was a marginal practice that was stigmatised, precisely because it turned dating into a specialised, insular activity. But online dating is now so popular that studies suggest it is the third most common way to meet a partner in Germany and the US. “We went from this situation where it was considered to be weird, stigmatised and taboo to being a very normal way to meet people.” Having popular spaces that are specifically created for privately meeting partners is “a really radical historical break” with courtship traditions. For the first time, it is easy to constantly meet partners who are outside your social circle. Plus, you can compartmentalise dating in “its own space and time”, separating it from the rest of your social and family life. Dating is also now – in the early stages, at least – a “domestic activity”. Instead of meeting people in public spaces, users of online dating platforms meet partners and start chatting to them from the privacy of their homes. This was especially true during the pandemic, when the use of platforms increased. “Dating, flirting and interacting with partners didn’t stop because of the pandemic. On the contrary, it just took place online. You have direct and individual access to partners. So you can keep your sexual life outside your social life and ensure people in your environment don’t know about it.” Alix, 21, another student in the book, says: “I’m not going to date a guy from my university because I don’t want to see him every day if it doesn’t work out. I don’t want to see him with another girl either. I just don’t want complications. That’s why I prefer it to be outside all that.” The first and most obvious consequence of this is that it has made access to casual sex much easier. Studies show that relationships formed on online dating platforms tend to become sexual much faster than other relationships. A French survey found that 56% of couples start having sex less than a month after they meet online, and a third first have sex when they have known each other less than a week. By comparison, 8% of couples who meet at work become sexual partners within a week – most wait several months. “On online dating platforms, you see people meeting a lot of sexual partners,” says Bergström. It is easier to have a short-term relationship, not just because it’s easier to engage with partners – but because it’s easier to disengage, too. “These are people who you do not know from elsewhere, that you do not need to see again.” This can be sexually liberating for some users. “You have a lot of sexual experimentation going on.” Bergström thinks this is particularly significant because of the double standards still applied to women who “sleep around”, pointing out that “women’s sexual behaviour is still judged differently and more severely than men’s”. By using online dating platforms, women can engage in sexual behaviour that would be considered “deviant” and simultaneously maintain a “respectable” image in front of their friends, colleagues and relations. “They can separate their social image from their sexual behaviour.” This is equally true for anyone who enjoys socially stigmatised sexual practices. “They have easier access to partners and sex.” Perhaps counterintuitively, even though people from a wide range of different backgrounds use online dating platforms, Bergström found users usually seek partners from their own social class and ethnicity. “In general, online dating platforms do not break down barriers or frontiers. They tend to reproduce them.” In the future, she predicts these platforms will play an even bigger and more important role in the way couples meet, which will reinforce the view that you should separate your sex life from the rest of your life. “Now, we’re in a situation where a lot of people meet their casual partners online. I think that could very easily turn into the norm. And it’s considered not very appropriate to interact and approach partners at a friend’s place, at a party. There are platforms for that. You should do that elsewhere. I think we’re going to see a kind of confinement of sex.” Overall, for Bergström, the privatisation of dating is part of a wider movement towards social insularity, which has been exacerbated by lockdown and the Covid crisis. “I believe this tendency, this evolution, is negative for social mixing and for being confronted and surprised by other people who are different to you, whose views are different to your own.” People are less exposed, socially, to people they haven’t specifically chosen to meet – and that has broader consequences for the way people in society interact and reach out to each other. “We need to think about what it means to be in a society that has moved inside and closed down,” she says. As Penelope, 47, a divorced working mother who no longer uses online dating platforms, puts it: “It’s helpful when you see someone with their friends, how they are with them, or if their friends tease them about something you’ve noticed, too, so you know it’s not just you. When it’s only you and that person, how do you get a sense of what they’re like in the world?” Some names have been changed",Lifestyle/Life and style,How online dating has changed the way we fall in love,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/13/how-online-dating-has-changed-the-way-we-fall-in-love
2/13/2022,"Arestaurant in Bloomington, Indiana, has eliminated tipping and is instead raising hourly wages for its employees. An eatery in Portland, Oregon, replaced optional tipping with a mandatory service fee. A restaurant group in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, eliminated tips and raised their minimum wages to $16 an hour. A Texas brew-pub is touting its no-tipping policy as the main reason behind its low employee turnover. There’s no argument that a tipping model has its problems. “The case against tipping is compelling,” writes Kathryn Campo Bowen on Eater.com. “It facilitates racism, sexism and widespread wage theft; perpetuates a growing income gap between front- and back-of-house staff, particularly in cities like New York and San Francisco; and contributes to a stigma that service work is transitory.”  And if you think that the “no-tipping” model is new and brought on because of the pandemic’s impact on restaurant workers, you’re mistaken. The practice in the US goes back to the early 20th century and became widely popular in the 1920s when prohibition cut into restaurants’ profits. But by the 2000s, a number of well-known proprietors (including famous restaurateur Danny Meyer) implemented, with much fanfare, no-tip policies in their eateries. A survey in 2016 found that of 503 randomly sampled restaurateurs, 18% said they had already adopted no-tipping policies, 29% said they planned to do the same and 17% said they would consider implementing no-tipping if others did. The no-tipping trend seemed to have reached a tipping point. And then … the trend reversed itself. So what happened? Turns out the tipping model was hurting restaurants because they couldn’t suddenly absorb the higher cost of wages. Maybe the brew-pub in Boerne, Texas (population 18,232) can get by with charging their limited audience higher prices. But restaurants in more competitive markets just can’t do that unless everyone rises prices together and that’s not going to happen anytime soon. But there was a much bigger problem: Meyer and others learned that eliminating tips hurt their employees. “The numbers don’t lie,” David Stockwell, the owner of an Italian bistro in Brooklyn told the New York Times. “We thought it was the rare instance when a good business decision lined up with a good ethical decision. But we realized all the problems that came with the model started rearing their heads in our business.” Stockwell’s restaurant had opened tip-free in 2016 but then reintroduced tipping in 2018. Meyer ended his no-tip policies. So did many other high-profile eateries. They couldn’t recruit people. They couldn’t retain good workers. Should this be surprising? Not to me. When I was in Australia a few years ago I ate at a bunch of places and was told never to leave a tip because employees were already fairly compensated. Similar models are common in many other parts of the world. Even in the UK, which I visit frequently, leaving a 20% tip as I normally do raises more than a few eyebrows. So why not here in the US? It’s because the US is, at its core, an entrepreneurial, free-market culture. And tipping is an entrepreneurial model. Customers are conditioned to tip and employees are conditioned to earn their tips – like any entrepreneur. And like any entrepreneur the better an employee – and their organization, and their team – the more money is made. “We treat our sections like our own small businesses,” write six workers with more than 50 years of experience in the restaurant industry. “To us, the restaurant floor is an interwoven system of independent entrepreneurs that runs like a well-oiled machine. We have no issue with an increased minimum wage for non-tipped workers, but for our industry the tipping model works for the guests, the employees and the company.” I have countless clients that are endlessly searching for ways to motivate their employees. They try team building apps. They give out awards. They offer performance bonuses. If only they had the built-in motivational tool that is the tip. When implemented the right way, it is a tool that turns an employee into a partner. It is all the motivation needed. Because in the end, tipping is more than just a wage and great workers want more than just a “fair wage”. They’re about making money for both themselves and their organizations. Tipping is the ultimate profit-sharing plan. It’s a chance for workers to have more control over their financial welfare. It gives them some skin in the game. If a restaurant is doing well because it’s safely operated, properly managed and delivers great food, and customers are enjoying the experience, then they will usually tip. The better the experience the better the tips. And when that happens, everyone – from the wait staff to the dishwashers – can share in the business’s success.",News/Business,‘The numbers don’t lie’: why no-tipping policies can hurt US restaurant workers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/13/us-tipping-restaurants-wages
2/13/2022,"Asynthetic fairytale for the era of livestreaming and monetised oversharing, Marry Me is a musical romcom that pairs a superstar celebrity, pop queen Kat Valdez (Jennifer Lopez), with Charlie (Owen Wilson), a divorced maths teacher in a shapeless cardigan. They are flung together after Kat, about to marry her boyfriend in front of 20 million viewers, discovers that he has cheated on her and plucks Charlie from the audience instead, forcibly marrying him in front of his traumatised 12-year-old daughter and the whole of Instagram. There’s something of the Notting Hill dynamic in this underpowered romance, in which the megastar, touched by the everyman appeal of her dad-joke spouting maths nerd, vacates her ivory tower to find love in the real world. It’s interesting to note that while the handsome prince in equivalent fairytales gets to retain his crown, the princess tends to be hauled down to earth. Or perhaps that’s reading too much into this silly, shallow romcom, which is as thin and predictable as Kat’s tinny pop songs.

2/13/2022,"The parents of a schoolgirl who has accused a stranger of rape have been told by police that there is not enough space in a Nightingale court for them to attend the alleged attacker’s trial. Instead, the family of the teenager have been advised that only one of her parents should sit in an overspill room that would be shared with two members of the alleged rapist’s family.  After being contacted by the Guardian, the Ministry of Justice has agreed to provide an extra seat so both parents can observe the trial of the man accused of sexually assaulting their daughter. But the girl’s mother questioned whether Nightingale courts – smaller courts set up to deal with a backlog of serious cases during the Covid pandemic – are fit for purpose. “No family member wants to have to listen to this stuff on their own, so being told that either I could attend, or my husband, but not both of us, is very traumatising,” she said. “I was just so shocked to be told I’d have to spend up a week sitting in small room, playing some macabre game of musical chairs with the family of the man who is being tried for raping my daughter.” The trial of the alleged rapist, after a lengthy wait, was supposed to be heard at a named London crown court earlier this year, but was diverted to a Nightingale site for later this year. In a crown court, there is usually enough room for the alleged victim and the family of the accused to sit separately in the public gallery. Last month, the alleged rape victim’s mother received an email from the investigating police officer saying there would not be enough room for both parents to attend. “To accommodate the jury, the public gallery is not in the court room and is in a separate room within the building where the proceedings can be viewed on video link,” the senior officer wrote. “I have been told the room only allows for 3 people and it would not surprise me if [the alleged rapist’s] extensive family will also be present. Therefore it may be utilised by them and could be upsetting for you to be in their presence and/or hear detail of the case. “[Named police officers] could instead keep you updated of proceedings. However it is a decision for you and [the alleged victim’s father] and if you really want to view I suggest only one of you due to the space issue.” The mother of the alleged victim said this was unacceptable because it would be her family’s first opportunity to hear the defendant’s case. “Our first and only opportunity to find out what his side of the story is, what witnesses have said, is in court. And the police are telling us we shouldn’t go. It sums up the utter insensitivity of the criminal justice system and the complete lack of empathy for victims and their families,” she said. Informed court sources said the police officer’s email accurately reflected the lack of space in the court. In July 2020, the government announced it would be opening Nightingale courts as part of its court recovery plan to address the impact of coronavirus on the justice system. There are at present 28 Nightingale courts. A Guardian analysis of home office statistics last year showed that fewer than one in 60 rape cases recorded by the police last year resulted in a suspect being charged. The family’s treatment has been condemned. Harriet Wistrich, the director of the Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “Clearly given the youth and vulnerability of the victim, this is not acceptable . Getting a rape case to trial is a major feat in itself given the less than 3% charge rate and it would be crazy if the prosecution fails because of inadequate court facilities.” The Ministry of Justice said space in the courtroom at the Nightingale court was limited and local officials had made every effort to enable a family member to be in the courtroom. An MoJ spokesperson said: “We are determined to support victims and will be providing extra seating so both parents can sit with their daughter. “The pandemic has placed unprecedented pressure on court space but measures such as Nightingale courts have allowed us to hear cases which would otherwise have faced significant further delay.” ",News/UK news,Nightingale court tells parents of victim of alleged rape there is no room for them at trial,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/13/nightingale-court-tells-parents-of-victim-of-alleged-there-is-no-room-for-them-at-trial
2/13/2022,"Alan Russell, who has died of cancer aged 78, was the production manager at the Birmingham Rep when its new theatre on Broad Street was being planned in the early 1970s. Theatre Projects Consultants had been appointed to oversee the project, and Alan joined their design team in 1971. I joined TPC two years later, and he and I soon became close colleagues and great friends. A theatre consultant may be involved in planning a new theatre or resuscitating an old one; the design of a theatre space fixed or flexible; or the design and specification of theatre technical equipment. The role varies depending on the relationships forged with the user and with the architect. There can be trouble with either an over ambitious publicly funded body or an artistic director with too many ideas. Support too eagerly a distinguished architect who has never built a theatre and you risk getting a theatre space that fails actor and audience, despite being set in a beautiful building.  Alan had the necessary qualities in abundance: a show business background; inexhaustible energy; knowledge of tried and tested solutions; an inquiring mind; and the capacity to create working relationships on each project and to involve colleagues at Theatre Projects who had complementary qualities. He worked on many UK theatres, as well as on arts centres in Macao and Singapore. There was an annus mirabilis – over six months in 1994 Alan and I completed our double acts on two great theatres, the new Glyndebourne and the rebuilding of every part of the Edinburgh Festival theatre save for the original auditorium. Both were completed on time and on budget. After his retirement in 2011, Alan became treasurer and secretary of the Institute of Theatre Consultants. In 2018 he edited and designed a large and lavishly illustrated book presenting 112 projects by members completed all over the world during the preceding four years. Alan was born in Gosport, Hampshire, the son of Cyril Russell, who worked for the local authority, and Dorothy (nee Eyles). He studied electrical engineering at University College London but got distracted by student theatre in his third year and decided not to take a degree. He joined Birmingham Rep in 1966 as chief electrician, and a year later became production manager. At UCL he met Jo Hart, who had exchanged studying the law for the wardrobe. They married in 1968, and had two sons, Ben and Thomas, who, when young, if asked what Dad did in the theatre, would answer “spannering” – which is not a bad description of Alan’s talent for getting new theatres sorted. Outside work, Alan enjoyed sailing and good burgundy. He is survived by Jo, Ben and two grandchildren, Anna and Joe. Thomas predeceased him.",Arts/Stage,Alan Russell obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/13/alan-russell-obituary
2/13/2022,"The staging is witty. In order to make an invisible man “visible”, an element of production usually hidden from audiences is laid bare. On a stage divided into two halves, one half is realistically set out to suggest the consultation room where Dr Kemp (Kate Louise Okello), star radio therapist, holds private sessions. The other half is a dark space in which stand a couple of benches strewn with seemingly random objects. This is the Foley area, where sound effects are created and other spaces suggested (pub, house, street, vicarage). When Daniel Watson’s Griffin finally succeeds in making himself invisible, he still seems to move before us thanks to the deft combination of Foley effects and his fellow actors’ reactions (to being beaten by unseen fists, for instance). Philip Correia’s new version of HG Wells’s much-adapted 1897 novel also plays with other notions of visibility/invisibility, but less successfully. The action, relocated to present-day north-east England, shuttles to and fro in time and space, exposing hidden forces that shape today’s society via the story of Griffin, a troubled teenager from a disadvantaged background who claims he can make living creatures invisible. When his actions inadvertently cause a tragic house fire, the authorities refuse to see the facts he presents and confine him to an institution. His new therapist, Kemp, has her own issues (of class, race and gender). She hopes, mad-scientist like, to exploit Griffin’s discovery so she might infiltrate corridors of power and exercise control over world events.  This production is part of Northern Stage’s project to support developing talent in the regions. I appreciated the commitment of the four young actors (including Jack Fairley and Izzy Ions in several roles), as directed by Anna Girvan; also the effectiveness of Aileen Kelly’s design and Jeremy Bradfield’s sound and music. The play’s plot, though, is too chaotic; drama and social critique, lacking focus, disappear from view.

2/13/2022,"Having tussled rather inelegantly with the work of Agatha Christie once before, with 2017’s Murder on the Orient Express, Kenneth Branagh again sports the improbable moustache and gloopy camembert accent of her detective Hercule Poirot. In the long-delayed Death on the Nile (the second version of the book, following the Peter Ustinov-starring 1978 outing), the moustache gets its own pre-credits origin story, which is considerably more background detail than most of the other characters are afforded. In this heavily CGI-augmented and opulently styled north African odyssey, Poirot finds himself tagging along on the honeymoon of the fabulously wealthy Linnet Ridgeway (Gal Gadot) and her new husband, Simon Doyle (Armie Hammer). Others accompanying the happy couple include Linnet’s cantankerous champagne socialist godmother, the bride’s sour-faced former fiance, a feckless toff and his overbearing mother, and a celebrated jazz singer and her niece (the starry cast includes Annette Bening, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders and Russell Brand). In addition, Simon’s jealousy-crazed ex-lover (Emma Mackey) is an uninvited but unshakable spectre at the celebrations.  The sheer weirdness of this setup is Christie’s, but the film does little to assuage the dysfunctionality of the guest list. It does, however, go some way to explaining why the increasingly frazzled Linnet knocks herself out with sleeping tablets every night. As a piece of film-making, it’s demonstrative and showy, all flowing champagne, mirthless, tinkling laughter and sexless, grimly gymnastic grappling on the dancefloor. The camera whirls giddily, dizzy from the sparkle and spectacle, but not quite able to conceal the fact that this is an empty bauble of a movie.",Arts/Film,Death on the Nile review – Branagh’s Poirot and co are all show,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/13/death-on-the-nile-review-kenneth-branagh-gal-gadot-armie-hammer
2/13/2022,"Leo Beckett, who has died aged 95, was my friend and co-conspirator as each of us in our own way supported Dame Margaret Beckett MP when she was environment secretary, then foreign secretary. Leo was Margaret’s most trusted counsellor for 50 years and ran her parliamentary office; they were married for 42 of those years. I was director of communications in her departments. An outstanding Labour and trade union organiser, Leo combined efficiency with care and concern for everybody involved. He was a genius in putting everybody at their ease. The son of Arthur Beckett, a soldier, and his wife, Marjorie (nee Holland), he was born in Brompton barracks, Chatham, in 1926, the year of the general strike, as he never failed to point out. He was named Lionel, but always known as Leo. Towards the end of the second world war, aged 18, he joined the RAF. These were formative years. His learning from fellow servicemen from mining and other working-class communities transformed his own political understanding.  His family had settled in Leadenham, Lincolnshire, and after his RAF service Leo was taken on as an apprentice, then offered a job, with the Lincoln engineering company Ruston Bucyrus (later taken over by GEC). He soon became an influential figure in Labour politics in the city. After the deselection of Dick Taverne (now Lord Taverne) as Lincoln’s Labour parliamentary candidate in 1972, Leo helped Margaret Jackson, the party’s new candidate, to win the seat back for Labour in October 1974, and they married in 1979. Leo joined Margaret to win Derby South in 1983 and hold it ever since. Beneath an effortless affability and humorous, at times cheeky, charm was a smart operator, adept in navigating turbulent waters at Westminster, in Margaret’s constituency in Derby South, and at Labour party conferences. Leo held deep values expressed through his love of, and loyalty to, the Labour party and Margaret herself. The Becketts shared a steely sense of common purpose and were one of parliament’s most successful partnerships. Except for the past two years, when his ill health made mobility difficult, Leo was always by Margaret’s side, working tirelessly well into his 90s and adapting to at least 10 changes in party leadership, including Margaret’s own brief spell as leader after John Smith’s death. This included supporting Margaret as a member of every Labour government since Harold Wilson was prime minister. Leo and Margaret only properly switched off when they enjoyed their caravan holidays. Modest, with a genial personality, Leo made everybody feel that they were special and made friends across the political spectrum. He was predeceased by his first wife, Beryl Firth, and their two sons, David and Roger.

2/13/2022,"The former Brexit minister David Frost has joined Conservative MPs in writing an open letter to Boris Johnson calling for a resumption of fracking in the UK, in another indication of the ongoing battle within the party over environmental issues. Lord Frost argued that extracting domestic shale gas would give the UK a “competitive and reliable source of energy”. But Zac Goldsmith, a key green voice in the government, said it would not reduce energy prices and would put ministers at “war with furious communities”.  The letter to the prime minister was organised by the Conservative Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) of Conservative MPs, which argues against many green levies and targets, saying the government should prioritise lower energy costs and more secure supplies. Last week, leading climate scientists told the Guardian that the group appeared to be trying to delay a shift towards lower emissions by including climate policies in a culture war and spreading disinformation, a charge the NZSG rejects. The MPs’ letter, shared with the Sunday Telegraph, said shale deposits around Lancashire and surrounding counties offer “at least 50 years of cheap and sustainable gas”. It read: “If levelling up is to mean anything it must be centred around empowering communities, rather than telling them what they can and cannot do … With the lack of public debate about our strategy to reach net zero, we have abandoned this fundamentally conservative principle … It’s time to reverse this moratorium.” The Sunday Telegraph said 29 MPs had signed the letter but named only five of them – Craig Mackinlay, Steve Baker, John Whittingdale, Bob Blackman and Julian Knight. The organisers of the letter declined to reveal any more names. Frost, who has emerged as a leading dissident voice on the Tory right since resigning from his ministerial role in December, told the Telegraph that fracking would bring “a competitive and reliable source of energy” and reduce reliance on imports. But Goldsmith, a Foreign Office minister and peer, said that to even replace half the gas the UK imports would require 6,000 fracking wells “with all the associated industrial equipment and endless movements of trucks ferrying toxic chemicals and wastewater to and from sites. It’s hard to imagine communities across the UK being OK with that.” In a series of tweets, Goldsmith said fracking was deeply unpopular with the public, and that since any shale gas extracted would be sold at international market prices it would have no impact on UK bills. Gas was still needed, he said, but added: “To have any impact at all, government would need to rig the market and go to war with furious communities. On every level the cost would be enormous.” The government’s position remains that fracking is “unproven” as a resource in the UK, and that the inability to accurately predict Earth tremors associated with it meant it could not be supported. The NZSG is campaigning alongside Cuadrilla, the company that operated two shale wells in Lancashire. Work at these was stopped in late 2019 when the government halted fracking in England after warnings about possible quakes. On Thursday, Cuadrilla announced it was plugging and abandoning its two shale wells at the Preston New Road site in Lancashire, on the instructions of the government’s Oil and Gas Authority. News of this was announced in a joint press release between Cuadrilla and the NZSG, including quotes from the group’s chair and vice-chair, Tory MPs Craig Mackinlay and Steve Baker, calling the decision “utter madness”. Similarly, the Telegraph article about the NZSG’s letter was published alongside a comment piece from the chief executive of Cuadrilla, Francis Egan, calling domestic fracking “a no-brainer”.",News/Environment,David Frost joins Tory MPs in calls for return of fracking in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/13/david-frost-joins-tory-mps-in-calls-for-return-of-fracking-in-uk
