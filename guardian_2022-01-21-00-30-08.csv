1/21/2022,"Late-night hosts lapped up details of financial misconduct by the Trump family on Wednesday evening, a day after the office of New York attorney general Letitia James told a court that its investigators uncovered a pattern of “fraudulent or misleading” business practices at the family company. “That’s believable,” said Stephen Colbert on The Late Show. “It’s certainly more believable than a pattern of business at the former president’s fraud.”  James filed the motion in response to Donald Trump’s attempts to block her from questioning him and two of his children, Don Jr and Ivanka, under oath. “Lord, please make that happen,” said Colbert. “I don’t ask for much, and I don’t ask often. All I want before I die is to see Don Jr swear in on a jar of hair gel. It’s the only thing he believes in.” According to the filing, James’s team found significant evidence that Trump fraudulently valued multiple assets, including his private residence in Manhattan; Trump claimed the triplex apartment was 30,000 sq feet in size, when in fact the actual size was just under 11,000 sq feet. “Yeah, that’s not a surprise – he’s known for falsely tripling the size of his assets,” Colbert remarked. “He once told Stormy Daniels his penis was three inches.” Trump’s being investigated for fraud because he inflated the value of an apartment… by 200 million dollars. pic.twitter.com/5lGAtn9PoY On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also reacted to the allegation that Trump overstated the valuation of his New York apartment by over $200m. “No, Donald, no! You can’t exaggerate your apartment’s value by $200m!” Noah said, feigning concern. “I mean, I’d get it if it’s an NFT, but this is an apartment, my friend!” “Donald Trump does not give a fuck, let’s be honest,” he continued. “This dude will brag about himself even if it gets him in trouble. I bet if a cop asks him how fast he was going, he was like ‘yeah, I do 400bn miles a second, the fastest anyone has ever gone, I was so fast. So fast, you want to test it again?’” But though there’s plenty about the former president to mock, “I can’t get mad at him for this,” Noah conceded. “Because deep down, he’s just a landlord, and this is what every landlord in New York does. They’ll say an apartment has three bedrooms, then you get there and two of the bedrooms are somehow in the kitchen, but it’s still the best deal for your budget, so you sleep in your dishwasher. It is what it is.” “The walls appear to be closing in on Trump,” said Jimmy Kimmel. “Big, beautiful walls. Mexico’s like, ‘let us know if you need us to chip in with that, muchachos.’” “Who could’ve ever predicted? I mean, of all things, fraud?” he joked, riffing through old news reports of the family’s numerous fraudulent schemes over decades, from Trump university to his father’s real estate business. “It’s a fairly straightforward case,” he concluded. “To find fraud in a business, you just have to look for the signs, particularly the signs at the top of the building that say Trump on them. And you will find it there. There is where you will find his male-pattern fraudness.” In other bad news for the the former president, the House select committee for the January 6th attack on the Capitol subpoenaed four of his former advisors this week, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. “Which is unnecessary – all they need to do is say his name three times in the mirror and he will appear,” Kimmel joked. “And even if he does show up to answer questions from the committee, he’s just going to lie. That’s just what he does. He’s a liar. He lies about things he doesn’t even need to lie about.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers tore into Giuliani’s subpoena for his role in spreading election lies and fomenting the January 6th insurrection “I’ll never get over the fact that that guy, who sounds like the guy who sprays the shoes at the bowling alley … that guy was once crowned ‘America’s Mayor’ on magazine covers and became the personal attorney to the president of the United States,” Meyers mused. “Rudy is what happens when a scientist accidentally splices the DNA of a fruit bat and Mr Bean, and yet somehow he ended up working for the most powerful person in the world.” “You imagine in your head that the President has all this power and information at their fingertips,” he continued. “They have 17 different intelligence agencies, the White House situation room, an army of government lawyers, and some of the richest, most powerful people in the world on their side, and yet Trump ended up with a Moleman who sweats like he’s the defendant.” “Trump told the guy to hold a press conference at the Four Seasons Hotel, and he ended up at the Four Seasons Landscaping Company,” he added. “As a career comedy writer, I’ve got to tip my hat.”",Arts/Culture,Colbert on Trump’s ‘pattern of possible fraud’: ‘Certainly more believable than a pattern of business’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/20/stephen-colbert-donald-trump-late-night-tv
1/21/2022,"Just one month into taking up her office as Germany’s new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock has her work cut out. At stake: nothing less than the attempt to stop the outbreak of war between Russia and the west. The news outlet Der Spiegel called her meeting this week with her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, “a baptism of fire”; Die Zeit, her “first major test of character”. For the tabloid Bild, it was the equivalent of “entering the cave of a bear”.  One left-leaning newspaper mischievously headlined a report about her mission “Baerbock tries to save the climate” – this time referring not to the leading Green’s efforts to tackle the climate crisis but to the considerable task she faces trying to foster dialogue between Europe and Russia to avoid a war involving nuclear powers. Few pleasantries were observed during her meeting with Lavrov, who has been in office for 17 years. Before and after a two-hour meeting on Wednesday, which took place behind closed doors in his gilded Moscow guesthouse, there was a distinct lack even of polite smiling, while eye contact was minimal. Footage of the opening minutes of the meeting, beamed to journalists in a neighbouring room, showed the two flanked by their aides, facing each other stony-faced across a long table conveniently divided down the middle by a neat row of hand-disinfectant bottles. The usual ritual of a closing photocall was ignored. Observed from Germany, as the world’s diplomats looked on, silent for now are conservative critics who have questioned whether as a mother of two young children, Baerbock is up to the task. Instead, the burning questions ahead of the encounter were: can she prevent a war? and another pressing domestic concern: is she able to ensure Russia does not cap energy supplies to Germany? The Russian view of Baerbock as an inexperienced stubborn misfit, out of her depth in her new role, was made clear last month after her appointment. “She is set on a confrontation course with Russia... behaving as if she was from the US Congress, not the Bundestag,” the state broadcaster Rossiya 1 declared. An expert from the Russian Academy of Sciences told the state-owned news agency Tass: “She is absolutely unsuited to the role. She is not a diplomat. She has no understanding [of] foreign policy and has a negative attitude towards Russia.” Not only is Baerbock new to the job: at 41, she also belongs to a fresh generation of German politicians. She is the country’s first female foreign minister. She had long since declared her desire to steer a hard course against what is unmistakably perceived, in Berlin and elsewhere, as Russian belligerence. As the counterparts emerged from their meeting to questions from German and Russian journalists, she told them: “I came here with a thick folder – thick due to the whole array of problems we have to discuss, about which our opinions differ hugely, in part fundamentally.” The most pressing issue: the threatening presence of 100,000 Russian soldiers posted close to Ukraine’s border. As Baerbock put it: “It’s hard not to see this as a threat.” The day before – the order of the visits was of symbolic importance, her aides stressed – while meeting Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in Kyiv, Baerbock earned ridicule there after rejecting his request for weapons. Kuleba expressed his disappointment, but responded: “We know from where we can get the weapons.” She emphasised instead the need for dialogue, calling diplomacy “the only viable way to diffuse a highly dangerous situation”. Lavrov said he was “open” for talks to continue, accusing Ukraine of failing to cooperate. He described his discussion with Baerbock as having been “of use”. A war of words between the two had begun before the Moscow meeting with Baerbock issuing a statement before her visit, outlining Germany’s position and Lavrov shooting back with an essay-style response about five times longer. He said the Russian government was disappointed about the state of Russian-German relations, accusing Germany of participating in the Nato presence in eastern Europe, expelling diplomats on spurious grounds in relation to the case of the poisoned Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny, and curtailing press freedom by putting pressure on Russian journalists working in Germany. Russia reserved the right to retaliate against German journalists, he said. Baerbock referred to the case of Navalny, imprisoned now for a year; to the recent disbandment of the human rights group NGO Memorial; to a murder in a central Berlin park for which a court said last month it suspected Russian intelligence was responsible. And she referred to what is probably the biggest elephant in the room: the controversial oil pipeline Nord Stream 2. Her opposition to it is longstanding – due not only to her green credentials but also to concern it will make Berlin dependent on Moscow. She said it could yet be stopped. “Should energy be used as a weapon this would have appropriate consequences in conjunction with this pipeline,” she said. Rieke Havertz, a political analyst at Die Zeit, concluded that Baerbock had “moved well within the narrow sequence of steps allowed to her in this, her first dance” on the stage of international diplomacy. It was not easy, Havertz added, for her to represent her Social Democratic boss, Olaf Scholz, whose party has a complicated Russian policy stance, not least due to its last chancellor, Gerhard Schröder’s close relationship with Vladimir Putin, from which the pipeline project was born and in which Schröder continues to be involved. Scholz, like his predecessor, the Christian Democrat Angela Merkel – and in contrast to Baerbock – would like to keep the pipeline separate from the politics and therefore out of the current conflict. For years, analysts have called this position naive. In its editorial on Thursday, the Süddeutsche Zeitung’s foreign editor, Stefan Kornelius, called it Germany’s “most important lever”, and said the impression Germany gave of being unprepared to abandon the pipeline was an “exploitable weakness”. Bild, not normally a supporter of Baerbock’s, called her visit “a successful debut in the cave of the bear”, praising her for “staying as stable as bamboo” and “not letting her eyelashes quiver”. It added: “She has earned our respect.” Still, a sober and ironic reality Baerbock now faces is that despite being in the heart of the German government, she has so far had few opportunities to talk about the issue at the heart of her own party’s raison d’etre: the environment. Except to announce in Kyiv that Germany would soon be opening a “bureau for hydrogen diplomacy”. Under the circumstances it sounded, remarked one commentator, “unintentionally funny, even though it was seriously meant”.",News/World news,Annalena Baerbock: the German minister staring down Russia over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/annalena-baerbock-the-german-minister-staring-down-russia-over-ukraine
1/21/2022,"An initial CIA investigation into the mysterious set of symptoms known as Havana syndrome has found that it is unlikely to be the result of a worldwide campaign of attacks by a foreign power against US diplomats and spies. However, two dozen cases, including some of those originally afflicted in Havana in 2016, could not be explained and would be further studied for evidence of a possible attack, according to a senior CIA official who briefed the US press.  “While we have reached some significant interim findings, we are not done,” the CIA director, Williams Burns, said in a statement. “We will continue the mission to investigate these incidents and provide access to world-class care for those who need it.” Since the original outbreak of the symptoms, which include hearing strange sounds, dizziness, loss of balance, nausea and memory loss, more than 1,000 cases have been studied around the world. The interim findings of a CIA investigation have found that the majority of cases could probably be attributed to a pre-existing medical condition, or environmental factors, or stress, the senior official said. The defence department and an independent panel of experts are conducting their own investigations which have yet to publish reports. The CIA finding suggests that after the initial cases were reported, hundreds of US embassy and intelligence agency employees started to wonder whether their symptoms could be related. Government agencies asked for anyone who thought they might be affected to file a report. Marc Polymeropoulos, a former senior CIA official who has suffered severe symptoms since a visit to Moscow in 2017, said the interim findings did not resolve anything. “They seem to have solved a problem they created with their mass data call – but core cases remain. So [are] we back to square one?” he asked on Twitter. A Havana syndrome victims support group said in a statement: “The decision to release the report now and with this particular set of ‘findings’ seems a breach of faith, and an undermining of the intent of Congress and the president to stand with us and reach a government-wide consensus as to what is behind this,” a Havana syndrome victims group said in a statement. “This report was neither cleared nor coordinated through the interagency and must stand as the assessment of one agency [CIA] alone.” The secretary of state, Tony Blinken, said that investigations would continue. “We are going to continue to do everything we can, with all the resources we can bring to bear, to understand, again, what happened, why, and who might be responsible,” Blinken said at a press conference in Berlin . “And we are leaving no stone unturned.”",News/US news,"‘Havana syndrome’ unlikely caused by hostile foreign power, CIA says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/20/havana-syndrome-cia-report-foreign-power
1/21/2022,"Thomas Bjørn can be forgiven Danish bias. “If they were British or American, there would be a lot more excitement around them,” he said. “But that might be a good thing for them. These guys have a level of ability that you don’t always see.” The subject matter is the 20-year-old Højgaard twins, Nicolai and Rasmus, about whom there was enthusiastic chatter long before they made impressive starts in esteemed company at the Abu Dhabi Championship. European golf, desperate for a good news tale after Ryder Cup humiliation last September, will place a lot of faith in the Højgaards. They created history last year by becoming the first brothers to win European Tour events in back-to-back weeks.  Bjørn answered with a firm “yes” when asked whether we are correct to make a fuss about this duo. “They have everything,” added the 2018 Ryder Cup captain. “They have the game, the willingness to learn, they are hard workers and don’t get ahead of themselves. We should be excited. That doesn’t mean ‘it just happens’ but they have it all. They have great ears and good people around them. I was really happy to see their draws this week. These are the things they need, to learn to play with the big boys.” Those pairings cannot be classed as coincidental with the DP World Tour looking to accelerate the development of European players. Nicolai was alongside Adam Scott and Bernd Wiesberger during an opening round of 69. Rasmus had Ian Poulter and Shane Lowry for company before signing for a 70 at Yas Links. “I was really impressed,” said Scott, the 2013 Masters champion. “I was saying to my caddie, it’s been a while since I have played with a young kid who made me sit back and take notice. His speed is incredible. If he figures out a short game; obviously he has a pretty good one but if he takes it to top-of-the-world level, there’s nothing stopping a kid like that. It’s phenomenal to watch, his easy speed is amazing. I am surprised there hasn’t been more media or murmurings about him in the US. “He was 30 yards past me down the last. I look at a kid like that and hope he works on the right things, gets the right advice and can go on because he has incredible talent. “There’s nothing stopping him from being one of the best players in the world. He has all the attributes you would want aged 20. I would just tell him to become a great wedge player because he is never going to lose that hitting ability. Dustin Johnson worked really hard on his wedges and became a machine out on tour. It looks like Dustin playing, to me.” High praise indeed. There was more, this time from Poulter for Rasmus. The Englishman and Ryder Cup icon, though, warned that the twins must not be burdened by unreasonable expectation. Rasmus already has three tour titles to his name. “To have those wins at 20, try to get your head around that for a minute,” said Poulter. “The game is natural to him. It’s effortless power. “It would be unfair for us to load pressure on these kids. They need to grow into themselves and become consistent golfers. We are going to need them, America are younger than ever and the baton has been handed across. We need them to slowly find their feet properly and if they do that, they’ll be a backbone of the Ryder Cup team for a long time.” Nicolai was the European amateur champion in 2018, the same year he joined his brother in the successful Danish side at the Eisenhower Trophy, the world amateur team championship. Starting this season as 88th and 97th in the world respectively Nicolai has more distance than his sibling but is also prone to being fierier. “Nicolai is extremely long but still in control,” says Bjørn. “Rasmus is not as long so they are a little bit different in how they play and in terms of personality but they possess great qualities.” Amid the other action on day one, Scott Jamieson’s 63 represents a course record at Yas Links. The Florida-based Scot leads by a shot from Viktor Hovland. Rory McIlroy’s competitive year started with a level par 72.

1/21/2022,"On 30 May 2020, photographer Philip Montgomery captured a police charge during protests in Minneapolis against the killing of George Floyd. The cops look like giant metal insects, every human part of them hidden. You can’t see faces through the glinting visors, or flesh under their robotic armour as they approach with guns blazing through a pale mist of teargas smoke. Blown up to the size of a painting, Montgomery’s spooky monochrome news photo looks like a premonition of the future in the Saatchi Gallery’s engrossing, unsettling exhibition America in Crisis. These sci-fi American stormtroopers mirror the warnings, a year on from the attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, that the world’s most powerful democracy is heading for a second civil war. Yet America in Crisis is not only about the future. It’s about how the present may be understood by the past.  For this show juxtaposes photographs of the US’s current troubles with images of a divided country more than half a century ago. It takes its title from a project organised by the Magnum photographers’ agency in 1969. America in Crisis involved such renowned snappers as Bruce Davidson and Elliott Erwitt in an exhibition and book reporting the protests, assassinations and inequalities of the 1960s – a decade that seems in glowing retrospect almost incomparably more hopeful and joyous than today’s bitter times. Yet the 60s don’t look so optimistic in Erwitt’s devastating photograph of Jackie Kennedy at her husband’s funeral in 1963. Today the most famous images of her black-clad mourning are Andy Warhol’s silkscreen pantings but where they are ashen icons, Erwitt takes us closer, through her veil, to see every twitch of her breaking face. Where she takes the tragedy of a nation on herself, Paul Fusco’s colour pictures of the train that carried Bobby Kennedy’s coffin from New York to Washington in 1968, met by grieving crowds along the way, portray a great community of pain. Black and white Americans squeeze together along a platform to salute the passing train, from which Fusco was watching with his camera. In 2020 it was not the slaying of a famous politician that got people on the streets but the murder of a citizen, Floyd, during his arrest by Minneapolis police that united one half of America in tears of rage. One of the most convincing continuities in this exhibition is between images of the 60s civil rights movement and Black Lives Matter. Davidson’s photographs of the Selma freedom march in 1965 pick individuals out of the crowd whose faces make you wonder where they are now, what their later lives were like: a young Black marcher gazes at us over the American flag he’s carrying, asking a question America still hasn’t answered. Kris Graves’s picture of Robert E Lee’s equestrian statue in Richmond, Virginia in 2020, its colossal plinth completely covered with graffiti, points right past the 1960s to the never-healed wounds of slavery. The most startling images here from the original America in Crisis collection are portraits of Black sharecroppers in South Carolina in 1966. They seem still to be living in the Great Depression. Perhaps America is timeless in its wrongs, its founding sin, the hypocrisy of a nation based on the declaration that all people “are created equal” when southern states based their way of life on slavery, so endemic in its history that it cannot go on like this. Yet as you explore America in Crisis, the parallels between past and present fade. Things are clearly getting worse. There was hope and joy in 1969, after all. Protest, 60s style, seems innocent and childlike now. In Marc Riboud’s definitive image of the era, a young woman called Jane Rose Kasmir holds up a flower to the guns of National Guardsmen during an anti-war march in 1967. LOVE says the banner behind two protesters at the Democratic convention in 1968. The keyword now is HATE. One photograph says it all: the silhouette of Donald Trump at a rally. There was no one like Trump in 1969. A picture of Richard Nixon is offered by comparison but any similarities are superficial: yes, Nixon showed how Republicans could benefit from culture wars by marshalling a “silent majority” of middle Americans horrified by the perceived excesses of the flower children, but when Watergate was exposed he went quietly. Trump refused to accept the result of a fair election, a lie his supporters still believe, and so took the US into completely uncharted territory. You see this leap into chaos in photographs of the attack on the Capitol last January. Balasz Gardi photographed a man in 18th-century revolutionary garb waving the US flag with a gang of masked putschists on the Capitol steps. This character dressed for a far-right version of the musical Hamilton is claiming the heritage of the founding fathers for an act that spat on the democracy they created. At times of violent change, wrote Karl Marx, when people are “creating something previously non-existent, at just such epochs of … crisis they anxiously summon up the spirits of the past to their aid”. The Capitol rioters in their weird costumes from a half-forgotten American history opened a new age that nothing from the past can help us to understand. This absorbing exhibition leaves you stupefied by the crisis that’s beginning.

Metier has failed to add to his decisive victory in the Tolworth Hurdle in three subsequent starts, but he hinted at a return to something like that level when fourth in a valuable race at Ascot just before Christmas. Harry Fry’s runner also has form on heavy going, unlike Emmet Mullins’s Carrarea, a sole ride on the card for Irish champion Paul Townend.  Fellow raider Lucky Max (3.35), however, is a winner on deep ground and defied a 15lb hike in the weights to complete a hat-trick in a big field at Cork in December.

A strong pace seems certain here and that just tips the balance in favour of Ben Pauling’s six-year-old, who proved his stamina at Huntingdon last month. Lingfield 1.50: Le Ligerien has never been the most consistent of performers but his debut win over fences at Chepstow a fortnight ago was backed up by a strong time so perhaps a wind op over the summer has done the trick. Market Rasen 2.05: Angels Landing improved to finish within five lengths of a useful winner at Ludlow earlier this month and starts his handicapping career on a very fair mark. Lingfield 2.25: If On The Blind Side runs to the form of his close second in a Grade Two in November, he will take all the beating but his last two outings have been well below par and Emitom, returning to hurdles after two tries over fences, may be the more reliable option.

1/21/2022,"“Pelléas is a one-off”, says François-Xavier Roth in the sleeve notes to his new recording, “The first exemplar of what opera was to become in the 20th and 21st centuries and of what it can no longer be”. As one of the turning points in the evolution of opera, Debussy’s masterpiece is already very well represented on disc, but Roth’s performance, which stems from a production at Opéra de Lille last year, differs from all its predecessors by having the period instruments of Les Siècles in the pit. In an opera whose drama depends so much on the minutest nuances of the word-setting and the web of orchestral motifs underpinning it, the use of gut strings and turn-of-the-20th-century woodwind and brass adds an extra dimension to the expressive palette. The gains are obvious right from the opening, where the dark, slowly churning strings, playing without vibrato, conjure up the atmosphere of ambiguity and veiled menace that pervades the whole work, right through to the trickle of woodwind tears with which it ends.  Roth makes Debussy’s handling of orchestral colour seem more magical than ever, and even though his orchestra lacks the sheer tonal heft of a modern band, the great climaxes, such as Golaud’s explosion of rage in the third act, or Pelléas and Mélisande’s final meeting in the last scene of the fourth, seem more intense than ever, while the moments of quiet lyricism are wrapped in textures of extraordinary delicacy. Because of Covid restrictions, the Lille staging directed by Daniel Jeanneteau was never performed before a live audience (though it was streamed), and this audio recording was able to achieve a studio-like clarity as a result. In an opera in which words matter so much, it’s a huge advantage having an entirely Francophone cast (though Debussy apparently favoured a non-French Mélisande, to emphasise her other-worldliness). Here every single syllable is distinct. Pelléas is a role that falls between conventional categories and here it’s the tenor Julien Behr, contrasting perfectly with Alexandre Duhamel’s baritone Golaud. Behr’s performance is quite staid, even in the more ecstatic moments, while Duhamel is never overbearing either; Golaud can never be the true “hero” of this opera, but in this recording he seems more sinned against than sinning, though Vannina Santoni’s velvety Mélisande seems utterly guileless too. The sepulchral Arkel is Jean Teitgen, the very fine Geneviève is Marie-Ange Todorovitch, while Golaud’s son Yniold is sung by a boy treble (Hadrien Joubert) rather than the usual adult soprano. But what matters most is the sense of a true ensemble performance, which makes Debussy’s endlessly beguiling score seem more miraculous than ever.",Arts/Music,Debussy: Pelléas et Mélisande review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/20/debussy-pelleas-et-melisande-review
1/21/2022,"Five hundred and fifty years ago next month, the king of Norway lost a deposit he had put down to settle a debt: more than a hundred wild, treeless islands in the sub-arctic North Sea. The Scottish king, James III, had wanted Rhenish florins, but he had to settle for Shetland instead. The archipelago eventually became part of the UK and has since developed a diverse, distinctive musical culture. This weekend, at the annual Celtic Connections festival in Glasgow, the Shetland 550 concerts will celebrate it, bringing together experimental composers, jazz performers, poets and players of traditional tunes. The series is co-curated by the award-winning fiddler Chris Stout, who was born in the three-mile-long Fair Isle (population: 68) before moving to the Mainland at eight (population: 18,765). “Although, even there, you’re still only ever three miles from the sea,” he says.  The Scottish influence on Shetland “was a very slow thing to happen”, he says; the English language didn’t make an impact until the late 18th century. “And when I say English, a very, very Scots tongue would have been used then.” To come from such a place often affords “an amazing feeling. It’s so small; you know your history so well because, for a large part of it, nobody moved on or out.” Its bare, craggy landscape is also very beautiful, with “mirrie dancers” (northern lights) through the winter and summer skies that never go dark. “But it’s not for the fainthearted,” he warns. “There’s nowhere to run and there’s nowhere to hide. If you try, you’ll probably fall off a cliff.” The intensity of being a Shetlander is a factor, he believes, in its passionate music. This includes the 340-tune Shetland fiddle repertoire, strong on shimmering resonance and layers of tones, like Norwegian fiddle music, but with danceable rhythms from Scottish pipe tunes. “It’s quite a cacophony, yet there’s a space in it that allows you to lean into it and feel your own emotion. It says a lot about who we are.” The popularity of fiddle music also shows how the islands absorb and adore influences from overseas. The fiddle was not indigenous, but introduced to islanders in the 18th century by Hanseatic sea-traders from northern Germany who played tunes to pass dreary hours on the waves. Through the centuries, Shetland has been an international trade hub for whaling, fishing and more recently oil, so ideas from other cultures have always travelled in. Nowadays, the National Trust, renewable energy, satellite-launch research (on Unst), tourism and online home working bring employment and curious outsiders. Born from that mix, music “has been part of everyday life for Shetlanders for ever”, says Inge Thomson, who used to play accordion tunes every day growing up on Fair Isle with her lighthouse-keeper father. A seasoned collaborator with Karine Polwart and the folklore collective Modern Fairies, she loves “trowie tunes” – troll tunes – from the tiny island of Fetlar, comparing their short, repetitive passages to music from Scandinavia. At Shetland 550, she will premiere her piece Myrkabrod Mynta, a work commissioned in 2019 by the KLF’s Bill Drummond as part of a series of compositions in the dead languages of Britain. It is written in Norn, the language spoken in Shetland before Scots and later English took hold, which is derived from Old Norse and still peppers Shetland dialect – the title translates as The Hill Mist Endeavours to Form Shape. Using the old language with music to try to describe the land has been fascinating, Thomson says. She regularly experiments with electronics to try to replicate the sounds of Shetland. “Growing up on Fair Isle, I like the sound of static, the whirl of windmills, the shimmery top-end sound of shingle, the sub-bass of a stormy sea. Living in those islands, you can’t not hear the elements. They become musical, too.” Other unique musicians have thrived on Shetland. They include the late “Peerie” (Little) Willie Johnson, a guitarist from the Yell who developed his own style of folk and jazz fusion, influenced by western swing and Gypsy tunes that he first heard on the radio, then taught himself by ear. Today, the jazz saxophonist Norman Willmore improvises around Shetland tunes in cross-genre collaborations – even trying to bend and shape his breaths to echo different techniques on string instruments. He was born on a kitchen floor in Shetland and spent his childhood not liking Scottish folk tunes “at all”, leaving home at 18 to study jazz. Hundreds of miles away in Wales, he realised the uniqueness of his home culture; he would get into “massive jams” after school “with people of all generations, which I know now was unusual”. The biggest lesson he learned in early adulthood was that “music brings so much community to ordinary people” – something that is also strengthened by people who leave the islands to gather ideas, Stout adds, before they return. There are other bands to shout about: the rockabilly group Isaac Webb Trio have signed to Wild Records in Los Angeles; the four-piece female close-harmony group Herkja recently reinvented Wicked Game as a spooky piece of subtle indie; and the beloved party band the Revellers cut up folk with the clamour of metal and the rough edges of punk. Stout credits their shared, dramatic birthplace as something that has helped them all along. “If you know where you come from, you can have a [musical] idea, look out into the world with security, and it’s fantastic. That’s what Shetland has given so many of us: a solid platform to leap off from.” Celtic Connections festival begins 20 January in Glasgow. Shetland-focused concerts are Norn Voices, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, 22 January; and A Peerie Foy, Old Fruitmarket, 23 January. Both are filmed for the festival digital programme, available 26 January.",Arts/Music,"Jazz, Old Norse and ‘troll tunes’: the strange, stunning music of Shetland",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/20/jazz-old-norse-and-troll-tunes-the-strange-stunning-music-of-shetland
1/21/2022,"Hello, and happy Thursday, It’s difficult to figure out what to say about the kind-of-surprising-yet- not-really-surprising-at-all collapse of Democrats’ effort to pass sweeping voting rights legislation.  Yes, the defeat is a major blow to Joe Biden, who spent significant political capital over the last few weeks, pushing the bill. Yes, the defeat makes Democrats, who pledged to protect voting rights when they took control of the US Senate last year, look incapable of governing. Yes, it’s disturbing to see just one Republican – Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – voice any kind of support for sweeping protections to support the right to vote. Yes, it’s astonishing to see two moderate Democrats block the bill because of their unflinching support for an arcane Senate rule. Yes, the defeat comes at a uniquely dangerous moment for democracy. There are plenty of takes to go around about why this push didn’t succeed – and I expect there will be more in the coming days. Biden should have pushed harder on voting rights sooner. Democrats were too ambitious in their proposal. Democrats should have focused on a narrower fix to the Electoral Count Act. Some of this thinking falls into what Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth, calls the “green lantern theory” of the presidency – a belief that the president can do anything, persuade anyone, if they try hard enough. In the end, the reason the voting rights bills failed was simple – 50 Republicans didn’t support the proposals and two Democrats didn’t support changing the filibuster. After watching the fight in Washington play out over the last few weeks, I’m not sure there’s anything Chuck Schumer or Biden could have done to change that. Maybe I’m wrong. That doesn’t mean that the 50 Republicans who blocked the bill should evade scrutiny. As others have noted, 16 current GOP senators voted to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act in 2006, but oppose the current bill, which would update the most powerful part of the law. Republicans have said Congress has no constitutional role in elections, ignoring a provision in Article I that explicitly authorizes Congress to set federal election rules. But the thing that’s stuck with me the most over the last week is an idea that undergirded the entire voting rights debate, sometimes spoken out loud and sometimes unsaid – the idea that voter suppression just isn’t that bad right now. I saw it a few months ago when an unnamed White House adviser told the Atlantic Democrats would figure out how to out-organize new voter restrictions (“show us what the rules are and we will figure out a way to educate our voters and make sure they understand how they can vote and we will get them out to vote”). Biden made a similar comment on Wednesday afternoon, saying “no matter how hard they make it for minorities to vote, I think you’re going to see them willing to stand in line and defy the attempt to keep them from being able to vote.” I saw it when Republican senators consistently touted that 94% of Americans said it was easy to vote in 2020 and that turnout was higher than ever. And I saw it on Tuesday, when Joe Manchin, one of two key Democratic holdouts on the filibuster said no one was going to be blocked from voting. “The laws are there, and the rules are there, and basically the government, the government will stand behind them and give them the right to vote,” Manchin said. “We act like we are going to obstruct people from voting; that is not going to happen.” Of course, there’s a mountain of evidence that cuts against all this. Election officials in Texas are rejecting an astronomically high number of absentee ballot requests after the state imposed new restrictions. After Georgia enacted new limits on the availability of drop boxes, the number of voters who used them dropped significantly. Republican lawmakers across the country are also redrawing electoral districts in a way that weakens the influence of Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters, especially in rapidly diversifying places. It’s an invisible form of voter suppression, but perhaps the most powerful, because the votes of those affected will matter less. I had this in mind when Senator Kyrsten Sinema, another Democratic holdout, argued on the Senate floor that passing voting rights legislation would not get at the underlying ills of political division in the US. It was a good line in her speech that just didn’t match up with reality. A provision in the Democratic voting rights bill prohibits severe partisan gerrymandering – something that would go a long way towards fostering more bipartisan compromise. At almost the same time the voting rights bill was taking place on Wednesday, the election board in Lincoln county, a rural and heavily GOP Georgia county near Augusta, was meeting to vote on a plan to close six of seven polling locations. Residents there have been organizing for weeks to block the move, saying that many in the county lack transportation and would have to drive far to get to the single polling location. The county says closing the polling places will save money and make it easier to administer elections. The plan stalled Wednesday evening, but it’s the type of thing that the federal government would have more oversight over if Democrats were able to pass their bill. “If it happens here and they’re successful, maybe we’re the pilot,” said the Rev Denise Freeman, a longtime resident who has been fighting the closures. “Maybe we’re the showcase for the rest of the world to disenfranchise voters so select people can stay in power.” I interviewed Martin Luther King III and his daughter Yolanda about what comes next in the fight for voting rights. Governor Ron DeSantis is proposing a massive new state agency to investigate election crimes, even though there’s little evidence of fraud in Florida. Preparations for the upcoming Texas primary are a bit of a mess as officials struggle to implement the state’s new voting restrictions. Officials have reported rejecting high percentages of mail-in ballot applications. The Ohio supreme court struck down GOP-drawn maps for both the state legislature and Congress, saying they were so partisan they violated the state constitution. Republicans in Virginia and Arizona have introduced a slew of new voter restrictions.",News/US news,"The not-surprising, very bad defeat of Biden’s attempt to protect voting | The fight to vote",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/20/joe-biden-voting-rights-legislation-failure
1/21/2022,"A Danish “biotech” company in which Novak Djokovic holds a majority stake is working on a “frequency” treatment for Covid-19 that an expert says bears similarities to the principles of homeopathy. The world No 1 men’s tennis player was forced to leave Australia on Sunday after the country’s immigration minister cancelled his visa on the basis that his presence in Australia might risk “civil unrest” as he is a “talisman of anti-vaccination sentiment”.  On Wednesday it emerged Djokovic had acquired an 80% stake in QuantBioRes, the website of which says it designs treatments for viral diseases and resistant bacteria through “predicting the electromagnetic frequency” that can interfere with a virus’s activity. “At QuantBioRes, we work in utilising unique and novel Resonant Recognition Model … a biophysical model based on findings that certain periodicities/frequencies within the distribution of energies of free electrons along the protein are critical for protein biological function and interaction with protein receptors and other targets,” the website says. It carries a quote from the Serbian-American scientist Nikola Tesla: “If you wish to understand the universe, think of energy, frequency and vibration.” Dr Darren Saunders, an Australian biomedical scientist, said the approach described on the QuantBioRes website was reminiscent of homeopathy, an alternative and unproven treatment that claims illness-causing substances can, in minute doses, treat people who are unwell. Homeopaths claim that by diluting these substances in water or alcohol, the resulting mixture retains an “imprint” of “frequency” of the original substance that triggers a healing response in the body by causing an energetic shift. Saunders said in his opinion it was “a stretch” for QuantBioRes to call itself a biotech company. “The ‘innovative technology’ they describe on their website does not reflect contemporary understanding of how biochemistry works,” Saunders said. “If any athletes or other potential investors would like advice on not blowing their cash on this stuff, my fees are reasonable.” The website says the company will “soon start testing different treatment approaches”, but a link encouraging people to “learn more” appeared to be broken when the Guardian attempted to access it. A link to a July 2020 announcement that QuantBioRes would test Covid-19 deactivation mechanisms also appeared to be broken. Prof Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and antimicrobial resistance expert, said the QuantBioRes website used “fancy terms” without providing any evidence of success of the methods it promoted. “They’ve given nothing in the way of data,” he said. “People are looking out for new molecules all the time, but the website describes a way of finding a new molecule without providing any evidence of success.” The chief executive of QuantBioRes, Ivan Loncarevic, denied that the methods developed by his company had anything to do with homeopathy, and defended the lack of data on the company’s website. “What we do has absolutely nothing to do with homeopathy,” he said in an interview. “The theory behind homeopathy is that you can transfer information from a chemical to another substance, such as water. What we do is to develop peptides with specific functionality. This is pure, classical science. “Of course we are not putting our data on our website for every idiot to look at. We will soon publish an article in a scientific journal that will collect all our clinical testing.” When asked when the article would be published, Loncarevic said: “With a little luck, in two to three months, after peer review.” Asked about Saunders’ opinion that it was “a stretch” for QuantBioRes to call itself a biotech company and that the “innovative technology” described on its site did not reflect contemporary understanding of how biochemistry worked, Loncarevic replied: “That’s because we are innovative.” He said other pioneers in engineering or science, such as Elon Musk and Galileo, had faced similar criticism when first airing their views. On the subject of broken links, he said this was the first time he had heard of the problem and “it’s not [done] on purpose”.

1/21/2022,"Does Armie Hammer ever yearn for the time when the worst thing people said was that nobody liked him? “Ten Long Years of Trying to Make Armie Hammer Happen” was the cruel but incisive headline of a 5,000-word BuzzFeed article from 2017 which concluded that only a wealthy white man could not merely have withstood so much failure but have been rewarded for it. The US actor tweeted about the piece, calling it “bitter AF” before making a celeb’s exit from the social media platform: he deleted his account then quietly reactivated it. Those must seem now like halcyon days. Hammer’s fall began a year ago when messages surfaced online, purportedly sent from him to various extramarital partners, suggesting an erotic interest in cannibalism. Sexual assault allegations were made by multiple women, while an accusation of rape prompted a Los Angeles police investigation. Hollywood tends to act fast when handling a scandal in the age of social media and #MeToo: Hammer was dropped immediately by his agents, William Morris Endeavor. He exited projects including the Jennifer Lopez romcom Shotgun Wedding, Amma Asante’s cold war thriller Billion Dollar Spy and The Offer, a 10-part series about the making of The Godfather. His scenes in Taika Waititi’s soccer comedy Next Goal Wins were reshot with Will Arnett taking his place.  It was too late, however, for Disney to excise him from its plush new version of the Agatha Christie whodunnit Death on the Nile. Shot before the pandemic, the film has remained moored, if not quite dead in the water. Its prospects were not enhanced by controversy surrounding another cast member, the Black Panther star Letitia Wright, who recently retweeted an anti-vaccine video that was described as “hot garbage” by her fellow Marvel Cinematic Universe alumnus Don Cheadle. While Wright’s behaviour is merely irresponsible, the allegations against Hammer (which he strongly denies) are criminal. As a prominent figure in Death on the Nile’s ensemble cast, it would have been too costly and complicated for Disney to reshoot his scenes using a replacement. That was the last-ditch course of action taken by Sony when the 2017 release of Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World coincided with abuse allegations against Kevin Spacey. His scenes as the billionaire J Paul Getty were reshot with Christopher Plummer, who later earned an Oscar nomination for the part. Meanwhile, loud sighs of relief must have emanated from everyone associated with the action comedy Baby Driver, which also featured Spacey but pipped the scandal to the post by four months. When reshoots are not an option, the best a studio can hope for is damage limitation, burying any incendiary elements low in the PR mix. Hammer appears briefly in the trailer for Death on the Nile, and is still featured in publicity material; but unlike co-stars such as Kenneth Branagh (who also directed the film), Annette Bening and even Wright, he hasn’t received the compliment of his own individual character poster. Including him in promotional interviews would also be too steep a risk, and hardly necessary when there are plenty of other famous faces in play. Disney had similar problems recently with another release. Like Death on the Nile, Steven Spielberg’s musical West Side Story faced a lengthy delay to its release because of the pandemic; it was also tainted by a sexual assault allegation that arose during that pause against one of its stars, Ansel Elgort, best known as a star of Baby Driver – a movie that is beginning to look jinxed. One irony is that Spielberg and the playwright Tony Kushner gave Elgort’s character some bad-boy credentials that were absent from the original Broadway show and the previous 1961 film. In their version, the romantic lead Tony is an ex-con who spent a year in prison after almost beating a rival gang member to death. The actor, who has a face like a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, is far too pretty and pouty to render that backstory convincing. It would be impossible to say whether the allegation, which Elgort has denied, describing the relationship with his accuser as “brief, legal and entirely consensual”, influenced the movie’s miserable box-office performance, but put it this way: it didn’t help. Even so, Disney hardly placed Elgort under house arrest. He was grouped with co-stars for press interviews, shifting the focus away from him and on to the movie. He also made a string of TV appearances in environments that promised zero chance of any curveball questions. The safest route for studios dealing with scandal-struck stars must be to resort to a media blackout such as the one imposed on Shia LaBeouf around the release of the drama Pieces of a Woman. After the musician and actor FKA twigs issued a lawsuit against him last January alleging emotional, physical and sexual abuse, Netflix removed any mention of LaBeouf from publicity surrounding the movie, including the awards season campaign that brought his co-star, Vanessa Kirby, an Oscar nomination. He issued a partial denial. It can even be necessary to quietly sideline actors involved tangentially in another star’s scandal, at least until the air clears. Some press interviews with Paul Bettany to promote the Amazon Studios drama Uncle Frank in late 2020 were withdrawn at the last moment to avoid questions about the dubious texts between the actor and his friend Johnny Depp, which had been made public during the Depp’s unsuccessful attempt to sue the Sun newspaper for calling him a “wife beater”. Depp may have been replaced by Mads Mikkelsen in the third Fantastic Beasts movie and had his recent film Minamata offloaded by MGM on to another distributor, but acclaim for the Marvel series WandaVision seems to have successfully laundered Bettany’s reputation. He was even doing the publicity rounds again recently, accepting GQ’s Boss Leading Man award and complaining to one newspaper that it was “an unpleasant feeling” to have his private correspondence read aloud in court. Maybe next time he might not join in with the banter of a chum who is fantasising about killing his ex-wife. Just a thought. The question of how far such controversy reaches is moot: bad publicity of any sort is too great a risk. Even so, there may be good news for Disney from a business perspective with Death on the Nile. The picture was greenlit while Branagh’s Murder on the Orient Express (which featured Depp among its cast) was on its way to a worldwide gross of $352m (£258m). As in the case of that 2017 whodunit, it is surely the combination of Branagh, Christie, a starry ensemble and a glossy, old-fashioned style of cinema – rather than any one performer – that will motivate the valuable older demographic to see the movie. One of the benefits of star-studded casts is that there is bound to be something for everyone. It’s like any half-decent biscuit tin: who cares if one or two are broken? No one would pretend that the allegations against Armie Hammer aren’t serious. But in terms of audience recognition, prestige and prizes, he is no Kevin Spacey. Beyond journalism and social media, it may be the case that older audiences don’t even know who he is, let alone what he is alleged to have done. Of course, wariness about returning to cinemas tends to be higher among that same demographic, which means that the release of Death on the Nile will not be plain sailing. If the movie does run aground, it might be one thing that can’t be blamed solely on this Hammer horror.  Death on the Nile is released on 11 February.",Arts/Film,What happens when your star is cancelled but you can’t cancel the film? ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/20/star-cancelled-film-scandals-armie-hammer-kevin-spacey-johnny-depp-movies
1/21/2022,"The last chance for federal legislation to stem the tide of Republican state-level attacks on the franchise died this week, when Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema rejected a bid by the Senate’s Democratic majority to change the filibuster rules to allow the passage of two voting rights bills. The Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act would together serve to establish a baseline of federal rules enabling access to the ballot in all 50 states, and would restore the congressional authority to oversee new election laws in states that have a history of racist voting restrictions – a civil rights-era provision that was gutted by the Republican-controlled supreme court. But the two bills have been blocked repeatedly by Senate Republicans, who have used the chamber’s supermajority rule to prevent them from coming to a vote.  With the support of President Biden, who endorsed filibuster changes in a speech in Atlanta last week, the Democrats hoped to carve out an exemption that would finally allow the bills to be passed – Sinema and Manchin, after all, had both professed support for the bills themselves, though Manchin’s endorsement had to be cajoled. And exemptions to the filibuster are nothing new: according to Exceptions to the Rule, a book about the filibuster by the governance scholar Molly Reynolds, the filibuster was amended 160 times between 1969 and 2014. Both Manchin and Sinema supported a carve-out to the filibuster just weeks ago, when they both agreed to amend the rule to allow the Senate to raise the national debt ceiling. But evidently, voting rights are different. Last Thursday, in a tearful speech on the Senate floor, Sinema announced that she would not support changing the filibuster to pass the bills. She called for compromise, and chided Democrats for not doing more to reach out to Republicans to treat the nation’s “disease of division”. For his part, after a meeting with Senate Democratic leaders on Tuesday night, Manchin, too, reiterated that he would not support a voting rights filibuster carve-out, and dismissed fears that Black Americans would be denied the ballot. “The government will stand behind them to make sure they have the right to vote,” Manchin said. “We have that. The things they’re talking about are in court.” Responsible adults, assessing the state of voting rights in America in good faith, would of course know that neither the Republican party nor the federal courts are partners in the effort to preserve voting rights. Republican-controlled state legislatures have spent years imposing restrictive laws that make it harder and harder for people of color to vote, and have now progressed to making it easier for themselves to discard the voters’ preferences if they choose. These efforts have largely been supported by the federal courts, where Republican partisans in robes have gutted voting protections and given the green light to severe restrictions. It was the supreme court’s evisceration of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, in the cases Shelby County v Holder and Brnovich v DNC, that spurred congressional Democrats to write the John Lewis Voting Rights Act in the first place – the bill that Manchin and Sinema profess to support. The Republican party and much of the federal judiciary won’t preserve the franchise; they’re in fact working in concert to destroy it. Any competent and honest political observer will acknowledge this. That Manchin and Sinema will not suggests that they are either cynical or stupid. For the past year, Manchin and Sinema have used the filibuster, and the Democrats’ paper-thin majority in the Senate, to flex their own influence, withholding their support on essential measures and hampering the Democrats’ agenda – most recently the Build Back Better Act, the Biden social infrastructure bill that Manchin single-handedly killed in December. They have served primarily as saboteurs, scuttling hopes that a Democratic trifecta in government might yield the actual realization of Democratic priorities. To hear Manchin and Sinema tell it, the filibuster has become a kind of totem: they speak of preserving the rule as a way of maintaining the principle that unity, cooperation and bipartisanship remain both possible and desirable. But for all their platitudes, there is little evidence that the filibuster encourages compromise. Critics like the writer and former Senate staffer Adam Jentleson have suggested that the filibuster in fact incentivizes obstructionism, giving the minority more opportunities to sabotage the majority’s agenda and few reasons to try to shape it. But Manchin and Sinema are immune to reality. They still speak as if the procedural accident of a 60-vote threshold represents some kind of republican virtue. Getting rid of it, they say, will plunge the country into disunity and distrust. One wonders what they think the state of the country is now. Manchin and Sinema’s naive intransigence on the filibuster is now helping the Republican party to usher in an era of nationwide voter suppression and election subversion that will end meaningful representative government as we know it. The senators insist on delivering bromides to cooperation and bipartisanship, and baselessly claim that the Republican party, radicalized against democracy and increasingly centering its politics around interpersonal cruelty, can be persuaded to support voting rights if only the Democrats were kinder, more patient and less willing to use the power that the voters gave them. Listening to them try to justify themselves, Manchin and Sinema sound bizarrely detached from reality, as if they’re reading lines from the wrong play. The Senate they describe, the Republican colleagues they imagine themselves to have, the country they think they are living in – none of these bear much relation to the present reality of politics in America. They offer no solutions for that reality, and no insight into its increasingly frayed constitutional order. Their best ideas consist of pretending that the Senate is not what it is, pretending that Republicans are not who they are. Like ostriches with their heads in the sand, they think that if they pretend not to see what is happening, then the circumstances will change by the force of their denial. This hasn’t worked, but Manchin and Sinema seem more committed to maintaining the delusion than to protecting the rights of this American people. And this is what makes their failure to do what is necessary to protect voting rights not only a tactical failure, but also a moral one.

1/21/2022,"Kamala Harris has joined in on the White House’s campaign to repair Joe Biden’s flub on Ukraine in his press conference on Wednesday, where he revealed Nato is divided on how to respond to a “minor incursion” from Russia. “The president of the United States has been very clear, and we as the United States are very clear: if Putin takes aggressive action, we are prepared to levy serious and severe costs. Period,” Harris said in a Thursday morning appearance on NBC’s Today Show.  Host Savannah Guthrie countered that the White House had been “less than clear”, issuing a statement just minutes after Biden’s press conference affirming the “united response” between the US and its allies. “Savannah, I’m being clear with you right now. If you’re interested, I’ll continue to be clear,” Harris said in response. During Wednesday’s two-hour press conference – his second solo press conference since taking office – Biden made surprising remarks on the decision Nato allies will face depending on the severity of a Russian incursion. “What you’re going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades, and it depends on what it does,” he said. “It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion, and then we end up having to fight about what to do and not do etc.” Asked to clarify what constitutes a minor incursion, Biden pointed to cyber-attacks and the presence of Russian intelligence officers. “There are differences in Nato as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens,” Biden said. “If there’s Russian forces crossing the border … I think that changes everything.” In a clarification issued 30 minutes after the end of the press conference, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said: “If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that’s a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe and united response from the United States and our allies.” The kerfuffle has alarmed the Ukrainian government, with one official telling CNN that Biden’s comment “gives green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure”. Harris went on the defense for Biden when Guthrie asked how “damaging” it was that Biden “openly talked about division within Nato countries and Nato allies”. “I think your audience knows Joe Biden has been working as the former head of foreign relations, and as the former vice-president and a senator in a role of leadership on foreign policy, for years,” Harris said. “I have witnessed him continuously engage in direct and honest conversations with our partners and allies, and this is no exception.”",News/US news,Kamala Harris insists US will respond aggressively on Ukraine after Biden flub,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/20/kamala-harris-ukraine-joe-biden-russia
