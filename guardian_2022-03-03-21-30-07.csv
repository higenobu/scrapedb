3/3/2022,"It’s no less pretty the thousandth time you see it. On an early-February evening in San Francisco, Stephen Curry threads into the heart of the Sacramento defense, spins in place, then whips a one-handed pass the length of the baseline through a tangle of turned heads. By the time it reaches Klay Thompson, the crowd builds to a murmur. A rhythm dribble, a three from the corner, a little blood-pumping bounce on his surgically restored left leg. The shot drops and the noise roars forth: same as it ever was. At first glance, the Golden State Warriors are telling a straightforward story this season: the club that rewired the NBA is back. After Curry and co ripped off three championships in four years from 2015 to 2018, their good fortune soured as quickly. In the 2019 finals, Kevin Durant ruptured his achilles tendon and Thompson tore his ACL; Durant left the club in free agency that summer. In the fourth game of the next season, Curry landed hard on his hand – not the record-setting right, small miracles – and missed nearly the entire year with broken bones and nerve damage. After spending a year rebuilding his knee, Thompson tore his own Achilles in November 2020: another full season lost. Now the team is mostly whole (Draymond Green, Golden State’s canniest passer and firiest defender, has started practicing again as he heals from a back injury, and Thompson has missed the last couple games with illness) and perched near its accustomed spot, second in the Western Conference with a 43-19 record. Perhaps owing to everything that’s happened outside of arenas in the interim, even those fans who groused over the Warriors’ dominance last decade have largely welcomed its return. The team scans as metaphor, the comeback beats dovetailing nicely with its hopeful, cooperative vision of the sport: Basketball for a Better Day. “I got goosebumps on the other side of the court just watching. Big smiles and all that,” Curry said after Thompson took the court again in January, and a chorus of players and fans online said the same. But that reading, of After rewinding to Before, obscures a more meaningful one. This is a team still struggling through, in key ways, still chasing what it once had. They’re showing you don’t have to get it all back to make it worthwhile. Slip some truth serum into the Gatorade bottles of Golden State’s Big Three, and they’d all tell you they prefer their former selves. Thompson has been solid, chipping in three triples a game, but he’s not yet the form-shooting android who once registered 37 points in a single quarter. At 31 years old, Green has reached the juncture where his cast-iron heft is as much a burden to be managed as an asset to be deployed. And Curry, the most prolific long-range marksman of all time, is suffering the first stretch in recent memory that might be called a slump. During the month of January, he shot 38.5 percent from the field; over 11 seasons of his career, he has done better than that from three. “Steph is human, I think people forget because he seemed inhuman for so long,” Golden State coach Steve Kerr said near the end of that month. “Shots just aren’t falling.” Still, the Warriors’ stock of individual talent has only ever been part of the team’s story, and as the big names have scuffled or missed time, the system has picked up the slack. “I’m a little more egalitarian in my approach,” Kerr told Insider in 2018, explaining his preference for a ball-movement-and-cutting approach over the feed-the-star sets favored leaguewide. “Maybe because I was a role player myself, I feel there’s a power in everybody touching the ball and everybody sharing in the offense.” When they’re humming, the Warriors seem controlled by a chess hustler working a speed game against an outmatched tourist. Defenders wall off fakes and feints in the far reaches, and all of a 19-year-old rookie is sailing to the rim on an open file. Kerr’s MO has obvious game-by-game benefits: even weathering a chilly Curry, the Warriors score seven more points per 100 possessions than their opponents, the third-most efficient mark in the NBA. But its real value is as a long-term investment. Golden State has made a custom of turning unwanted players—low draft picks, well-pedigreed disappointments—into reliable and enthusiastic contributors. The team drafted Jordan Poole with the 28th selection in 2019, the kind of pick often thrown in as who-cares trade fodder; holding down a starting role until Thompson’s return, he averaged 17 and a half points a game. Gary Payton II was nearly out of the league before the Warriors took a flier on the point guard in October; he has become one of the league’s most bothersome defenders, capable of ripping a ballhandler on one possession and snuffing the shot of an MVP center the next. The most successful of the reclamation projects has been Andrew Wiggins, a onetime top overall pick who, over six seasons in Minnesota, stayed stuck in a state of potential. He had long arms and a born scorer’s springy athleticism, but at one point in 2019 devolved to one of the worst shooters in the league, and the Timberwolves sent him to Golden State midway through last season. Afforded space by Curry and trust from Kerr, Wiggins has morphed into what he was long projected to be, a glyph of rim-rattling, shot-blocking, jumper-canning bounciness. He’s set career marks across the board this year—including, to be sure, in smiles—and in January was named to his first All-Star team. Kerr called the announcement “one of the proudest moments I’ve had as a coach.” To be appreciated beyond their own city, great teams have to thread a needle. They need to be excellent but relatable, to win without that winning seeming like a simple unspooling of superior talent. At their peak, the Warriors failed at this (and this alone). A fluke of the salary cap had let them sign Durant in 2016 and slot the four-time scoring champion next to the best shooting tandem in history. They went out and collected championships until they got too hurt to do so. Now? Now, the Warriors are thrillingly, lovably fallible. (Durant would’ve been a sure firewall against the 19-point comeback they surrendered to the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday evening.) In a mid-February game against the Lakers, they trailed late; a loss would have been their third straight. Curry had missed six of seven three-point tries, and without Green, Golden State couldn’t do much to slow LeBron James. But Klay Thompson caught some of the old fire, tracking to open spots and firing as soon as the ball touched his hands—16 fourth-quarter points in all and three triples in the last four minutes. With 45 seconds left and the Warriors protecting a one-point lead, Curry dribbled out near the midcourt logo. In years past, this would have been time for the calling card: a stepback three, a shimmy started before ball touched net. Instead, Curry hesitated and then opted for plan B, slipping into the lane and scooping a steep layup over the arms of the back-line defenders. The shot hung on the rim before dropping, and while it did so Curry stood on the baseline with his head tipped back, watching the ball. He wasn’t celebrating but hoping for a good end to a tough night.

3/3/2022,"Western sanctions must be extended to include all Russian banks, ending the carve-out for energy-related Russian institutions, the UK foreign secretary has said following a meeting in Vilnius with foreign ministers from the three Baltic countries. Liz Truss said the UK “was trying to make sure the Russian economy is crippled so that it can no longer be able to fund its war machine”, adding that she hoped the Russian people would draw their conclusions if this happened. She praised the Russian demonstrators protesting against what she described as Putin’s war of choice, adding: “I do not believe Putin speaks on behalf of the Russian people.” A group of energy-dependent countries within the EU have successfully argued that that some major Russian banks including Gazprombank and Sberbank should not be kicked out of the Swift international payments system. If Gazprombank was excluded from Swift gas and oil imports from Russia into Europe would become increasingly difficult, forcing up prices even higher. But Truss said: “We need to make sure no Russian bank has access to Swift.” She added that the west had two clear objectives: “Vladimir Putin must fail in this horrific enterprise and his ambitions go no further.” Some Baltic States want a no-fly zone be implemented, but the US and UK oppose this on the grounds it could lead to a direct conflict with Russia. British troops lead a joint expeditionary force in Estonia that has been strengthened by doubling the number of UK forces in recent weeks as the Russian threat to Nato countries has grown. Truss added that UK intelligence was working more closely with Lithuania to look for any evidence of Russian troop buildups in the Suwalki gap, a narrow strip of land between Belarus and Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave. She said the west’s weapons were being used to stop Putin’s tanks, but that more needed to be done. “This is a struggle not just for Ukraine’s freedom and self-determination, but for all of our freedom and security. By continuing to respond with strength we will together ensure that Putin loses.” She confirmed she would personally attend an EU meeting of foreign ministers on Friday, despite Britain having left the bloc, where she will raise the issue of further sanctions on Belarus. She will attend alongside the Ukraine foreign affairs minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. She will also attend a Nato meeting on Friday where foreign ministers are due to have a larger discussion about a change in defence strategy.",News/World news,"Sanctions must be extended to all Russian banks, says Liz Truss",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/sanctions-must-be-extended-all-russian-banks-liz-truss-ukraine
3/3/2022,"From the upbeat opening bars of its theme tune and the declaration that “Everybody needs good neighbours”, Neighbours was like a blast of fresh air blowing across British TV screens in 1986. Here was a show that was on BBC One twice a day; lunchtime and a repeat in the late afternoon. This was when Netflix was but a twinkle in Reed Hastings’s eye and a “streaming service” was probably a water-feature option offered by landscape gardeners. You watched Neighbours or you missed it. Centred on Ramsay Street, the Lassiters hotel complex, and the lives of the Ramsays and the Robinsons (think Jim Robinson and mother-in-law Helen Daniels), it was soon a must-watch for students in the UK because – despite being watched “ironically”, however one does that – it had young people at its heart. This is the show that brought us Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Guy Pearce and Panda from The Masked Singer, Natalie Imbruglia. Talk about a hit factory. But, wandering the banks of Lassiters lake, we were also in the company of Harold and Madge, Dr Karl and Susan Kennedy, “Toadfish” Rebecchi and more. But now, the curtain falls. After almost 9,000 episodes, Neighbours is to come to an end. For those of us who have been working from home long before Covid forced it on the many, Neighbours became an important part of the daily routine. The advantage of being an author is that no one is there to tell you what to do. You may think this meant that, back in the day, we were in danger of putting our feet up and watching Homes Under the Hammer or Bargain Hunt rather than knuckling down on our typewriter, Amstrad or, later, PC. For me, in fact, it was the opposite. It was knowing when to stop writing. The advent of Neighbours was an excuse to take a break; a reason to take a break. I’d stop work, make a sandwich and watch Neighbours. Very quickly, I was hooked on my TV “good friends”. So was fellow children’s author, Philip Pullman. Across this green and pleasant land people were tuning in and falling under its spell. Disaster struck in 2008 when Neighbours moved to Channel 5. Hard to believe now, but Channel 5 didn’t cover the whole country. I was living in Bexhill-on-Sea and, if the channel’s analogue signal reached us it would reach across the other Channel and interfere with French broadcasting. As a result, Channel 5 had to be blocked. My then editor, Suzy, would set her video to record Neighbours every day and post the tape to me on Saturdays. That way, I would be able watch an episode daily, but a week behind. Then, dear reader, I actually found myself on Ramsay Street. I was invited to Australia to appear at literary festivals and, half-jokingly, I agreed on the understanding that I would get to visit the set of Neighbours. And I did. I went to the studio, to the lake, to watch filming on location and to Ramsay Street, all in the company of Jackie Woodburne, better known as Susan Kennedy. She was wonderful and, at the end of our visit, invited us to have dinner at her home. That, as the song has assured us all these years, is when good neighbours become good friends.

3/3/2022,"Boris Johnson is under growing pressure from the EU to go further and faster in sanctioning Russian oligarchs over fears that assets are being swept out of the UK. Contrary to the prime minister’s claims to be leading the world in the economic response to the invasion of Ukraine, there is frustration among allies over the UK’s lethargy in hitting Russian wealth. The government is being urged in behind-the-scenes discussions with the EU to target more named individuals believed to be sheltering their wealth in London property and financial structures. That private frustration was made public in comments from Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s first vice-president on Thursday. “I don’t hesitate to say this,” Timmermans told the BBC. “The UK is now following our lead. And I’m sure they will continue to follow the lead because the pressure of the public opinion in the UK is very clear about this. “And I think now even parties who accepted funding from oligarchs should understand that they, you know, they need to change course, because that’s what – if I don’t misunderstand the public mood in the UK – that’s what the British public want.” The Foreign Office has for days been promising to publish a schedule of oligarchs it will hit, but as yet just eight such individuals with links to Vladimir Putin have been listed. Meanwhile, among the 680 individuals subject to EU asset freezes and travel bans, are tens of named oligarchs or Putin allies, including Igor Shuvalov, formerly Vladimir Putin’s deputy prime minister, who sits on the Russian security council. Asked about the discrepancy between the UK and EU record on sanctioning individuals around Putin, the Home Office minister Damian Hinds told the BBC that “it was not a competition”. On Wednesday, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, questioned why Shuvalov, who owns two luxury flats in Whitehall Court, and others like him, were not yet being targeted by the British government. The owner of Chelsea football club, Roman Abramovich, who Starmer said had been accused in a leaked Home Office document of having links to the Russian state as well as to “corrupt activity and practices”, is also not yet subject to UK restrictive measures. Abramovich has announced that he is selling the London club. EU officials confirmed that they were concerned by the flight of assets out of the UK, which has long been a favourite location for shielding the wealth of Russian oligarchs linked to the Putin regime. “On the question of oligarchs, I think we believe seizing and freezing assets [is] really important and we believe one of the most effective tools,” an EU official said. “Of course, we are encouraging partners to do the same and to move as quickly as possible.” The official added: “Speed is of the essence, because if you are announce sanctions and then you take a week to take, then the assets are somewhere else. So that’s important.” A series of high-profile examples of action within the EU against figures close to Putin has highlighted the discrepancy. On Thursday the French authorities announced they had taken a €108m yacht owned by Igor Sechin, chief executive of the large Russian energy firm Rosneft. Donors who have made money from Russia or have alleged links to the Putin regime have given £1.93m to either the Conservative party or individual Conservative associations since Boris Johnson took power in July 2019, according to analysis by Labour.",News/World news,EU urges UK to act faster before Russian assets are spirited away,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/eu-urges-uk-to-act-faster-before-russian-assets-are-spirited-away
3/3/2022,"It is impossible to watch Max Webster’s modern-dress staging of Henry V without seeing flashes of Russia’s war on Ukraine in its machine-gun fire, bomb blasts and other pointed scenes of violence. Kit Harington’s King Harry is not a tyrant in Putin’s strongman mould but a seemingly reasonable leader, though we begin with a brief flashback to his Prince Hal days: he snorts coke and vomits before that dissolute memory melts away. The reformed king appears like a chief executive and his court an accountancy firm – all steel grey suits and shirts – so that his proposition to invade France seems closer to a corporate takeover. It is a stark moment when the army fatigues and automatic rifles emerge on stage and the reality of war commences. Every performance is polished but Harington absolutely stands out: he begins quietly and while he never raises the volume, his transformation in victory is monstrous, erupting into manic laughter on hearing England has triumphed at Agincourt. As a soldier he has no hint of the machiavellian, rousing his troops before Harfleur (“teach them how to war”), and crouching down to their level in his magnificent St Crispin’s Day speech so that he appears suddenly not the king of divine rights but an equal fighter among them. As a conqueror, though, he shows himself to be a businessman tyrant. He forces marriage on to Katherine, the defeated French monarch’s daughter (Anoushka Lucas, excellent at emanating contained trauma), in the manner of a swiftly brokered business arrangement, which he seals with a cursory handshake and forced kiss. There are other powerful moments: Bardolph’s hanging is painfully protracted, spot-lit as he swings (Lee Curran’s lighting, as a whole, is superb). English soldiers appear like debauched barbarians when victory is declared, grinding themselves to a thumping electronic beat in an after-party of sorts. But this is, ultimately, an over-orchestrated production, bringing together so many elements on Fly Davis’s gold set that it feels like theatrical overkill. The first half is especially over-stuffed: a back-screen with projected images (from dynastic family trees to closeups, designed by Andrzej Goulding) also comes apart to form the St George’s Cross. The various visual effects are arresting but cumulatively overwhelming. There is also choral singing, again powerful, but this comes too frequently and undercuts the strength of Shakespeare’s words, especially after the St Crispin’s Day speech. There is an almost constant whirl of movement as actors enter and exit from gangways on either side of the stage, and soldiers at war move with carefully choreographed grace, which seems antithetical in essence to the ugly mess of battle. The second half is more meditative and stripped back, bringing moments of immense power. French is inserted into many scenes, with a translation running on a screen beside the stage. While Shakespeare’s original French conversation between Katherine and her lady in waiting, Alice (Marienella Phillips), works well for its playfulness – the women work out in boxing gloves while they talk – the additional French feels unnecessary and alienating. The chorus, meanwhile, is a green-haired millennial (Millicent Wong) who declaims in arch tones, perhaps aiming for irony, and occasionally throws in some Mandarin. It is puzzling and grating – one of too many bells and whistles in a production where less might have been much more.

3/3/2022,"Seven teams will be fearing the drop from the Premier League. Those who survive will need moments of quality, to utilise their experience and potentially a little bit of luck to ensure they do not finish in the bottom three. Newcastle have shown how quickly things can turn thanks to an unbeaten run of seven games, including four wins, which has lifted them to 14th. They have been aided by new signings, especially Kieran Trippier, who has scored twice to help secure six vital points. The full-back’s ability from dead-ball situations is priceless at the lower end of the table and Newcastle will miss him as he recovers from a foot injury. Most teams battling relegation struggle to create chances, so having someone who can settle a match with a free-kick or send in inch-perfect crosses from set pieces is a huge asset. But momentum is key in football and the fact Newcastle now have it should see them to safety. At the opposite end of the form spectrum are Brentford, who have not won in eight matches. In that period they have scored only four times and I fear they will struggle to find the goals required to keep their heads above water. They have crucial games coming up against Norwich on Saturday and Burnley a week later, and if they fail to win either they will be in a very difficult position. They started the season impressively, winning three of their opening seven fixtures, but have won as many in their next 20 matches. Looking at their game against Burnley, I would back Sean Dyche’s side to win because they have the greater experience in relegation battles and know how to get out of it. Experience in these situations can be the difference, although the reason Burnley are used to survival fights is they have failed to improve their squad in recent years. Last season they finished 17th but they have not corrected their faults. They sold Chris Wood to Newcastle in January and replaced him with the impressive Wout Weghorst, but a club in their sixth consecutive Premier League season should have two strikers of that standard. When they lose one of their starting XI things fall apart for Burnley because of a lack of strength in depth, and that cannot be the case for a team looking to succeed. They are helped by a strong defensive foundation, giving them the best goal difference in the bottom seven, which could be crucial. Burnley blew the chance to leapfrog 17th-placed Everton on Tuesday, losing at home to Leicester. Everton rightly feel aggrieved over missing out on a penalty against Manchester City and potentially a well-earned point but they should not require extra motivation – their main motivation should be the table. They are a Jekyll and Hyde team at the moment; I see what Frank Lampard is trying to do and I really enjoyed their performance against Manchester City after a poor result at Southampton. I think Abdoulaye Doucouré coming back on Saturday and the change of shape was really good, they defended well for long periods and it was just a mistake that cost them a goal. I think they have the hardest run-in of those in trouble, meaning they will need to be more Dr Jekyll than Mr Hyde. Leeds will be hoping to enjoy a new manager bounce after replacing Marcelo Bielsa with Jesse Marsch. Bielsa did amazing things and the club have taken what will have been a difficult decision for them, considering his achievements. Marsch’s key task will be to make the team more organised – he will try to focus on making the defence more solid. They have the league’s worst defensive record and the team who concede the most almost always go down. They have quality players who will get goals but have missed Patrick Bamford, Liam Cooper and Kalvin Phillips, so if Marsch can have them available it will help take them to safety. Those sitting in 14th to 18th have a great advantage over the bottom two, Norwich and Watford, who don’t look capable of getting out of trouble, realistically leaving one relegation spot available. Watford have brought in Roy Hodgson to change the dynamic within the side and – true to his style – he has made them better defensively. They are more organised and have corrected some of the problems they suffered under Xisco Muñoz and Claudio Ranieri. The Watford fans will just wish the club’s hierarchy had acted sooner to bring in the former England manager. Hodgson has made them hard to beat but that may not be enough with only 19 points from 26 games. Norwich have similarly seen an improvement since replacing Daniel Farke with Dean Smith but still look likely to start next season back in the Championship. I watched them lose to Southampton and they were 1-0 behind for a long period but could not change gear to pressure the opposition. I was really disappointed in them, given they were bottom and in need of a result. Their problem will always be a lack of goals: they have scored 15 in 26 matches and only two players have more than one goal. A number of the bottom seven still have to face each other, meaning there are plenty of interesting games to come and the points required to stay up will probably be in the mid-30s. The destiny of the relegation spots could go down to the final kick.",Sport/Football,The key factors that will decide Premier League’s seven-team relegation scrap | Karen Carney,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/03/key-factors-premier-league-seven-team-relegation-scrap
3/3/2022,"Also known as Lust at First Bite and Love at First Gulp respectively, these films from the golden age of adult cinema exist in softcore and hardcore versions. Taking his cue from Bela Lugosi, Gillis nails the brooding bloodsucker persona, as well as his co-stars. Gussied up in edgy earrings and a greasy ponytail, Roxburgh looks like a superannuated Bono, while his hammy performance makes him seem less like a dangerous suitor and more a tiresome party bore. His big set piece, the vampire ball, rips off the far superior Dance of the Vampires. The beefy Spanish horror legend Naschy, better known for his wolfman roles, plays a sincere, melancholy count posing as the head of a Transylvanian sanatorium. Can the four stranded beauties in low-cut Little Bo Peep costumes help him reincarnate his dead daughter? Blood rituals and bare bosoms galore! Also known as Dracula 2001 or 2002, depending on your country’s release date. Hi-tech thieves unwittingly transport Dracula’s coffin to New Orleans, where Virgin Megastore promises to cater to his needs. Pre-fame Butler, yet to acquire action-man clout, lacks gravitas, but the origin story is ingenious. Untold? By 2014, we had seen Vlad “the Impaler” Țepeș impaling Turks and going full-on vampire a zillion times, albeit not set almost entirely in a CGI-heavy 15th century. Evans is more ripped superhero than fearsome demon – and a good enough actor to deserve a better vampire vehicle. Michio Yamamoto’s “bloodthirsty trilogy”, influenced more by Hammer than by homegrown Japanese mythology, merges British-style gothic and the landscape of Honshu with slow-moving but unheimlich results. Kishida plays “the Vampire” as a growlym whey-faced vampire with golden eyes and also the devious principal of a young ladies’ academy. “Children of the night … shut up!” This dated but disarming romcom is a better Mel-Brooks-style spoof than Brooks’ own Dracula: Dead and Loving It. Hamilton’s unfeasibly suntanned count gets hounded out of Transylvania by communists and moves to Manhattan in pursuit of a cover girl (Susan Saint James). The oddball Canadian director Guy Maddin applies his fuzzy-focus quasi-silent movie style to the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s production of Bram Stoker’s story, set to Mahler in monochrome with flashes of colour. Highlights are Lucy and Mina’s dreamlike duets with the seductive stranger from the east, who bleeds gold coins when stabbed. Carradine’s gaunt face, staring eyes and dapper moustache make him an ideal second-tier Dracula. He played the character several times, notably in two of Universal’s multimonster meets, where he is a bit of a ladies’ man (admittedly helped by hypnotic powers), but easily defeated by exposure to sunlight. Palance, with genuine Slavic cheekbones (his parents were Ukrainian), was an obvious choice for the title role in Dan Curtis’s chatty telefilm. Richard Matheson’s script is the first to connect Dracula to Vlad the Impaler, who believes Lucy is his lost soulmate. It was also the first time Stoker got a title credit. Dracula, sickly for lack of nourishment, travels to 1920s Italy in a desperate quest for the blood of “wirgins” – only to find his prospective victims deflowered by virile communist handyman Joe Dallesandro. Paul Morrissey’s companion piece to Flesh for Frankenstein is camp, silly and beautiful, with Kier oozing pathos as a decadent blood junkie running out of time. Francis Ford Coppola’s sumptuous melodrama takes its cues from the 1974 telefilm as Dracula winds up in Victorian England and fixates on the woman he believes is his reincarnated paramour. When not morphing into rats or green mist, Oldman’s low-key Dracula tends to be upstaged by Eiko Ishioka’s spectacular costumes. Worse, Oldman is so lovelorn that he is not at all scary. Forgive the cheating, but I am counting the first and best episode of the three-part BBC mini-series (from the people who brought you Sherlock) as a standalone feature. Bang starts off wrinkly and gets younger as he drains Jonathan Harker of his blood. This Dracula is a loquacious, feral parasite, authentically malignant and never remotely human. Langella reprises the role he played in a 1970s Broadway revival of the 1920s play (Raul Julia, Terence Stamp and Jeremy Brett also played it on stage). John Badham’s film amps up the count’s romantic side, all hand-kissing and come-hither gazing, leading to semi-psychedelic love scenes. It is only Langella’s contemporary bouffant that lets the side down. Received wisdom has it that the plebeian-looking Chaney is miscast as “Count Alucard” in Robert Siodmak’s contribution to Universal’s monsterverse. But think of him as the lovestruck patsy of a film noir femme fatale and he becomes an almost tragic figure. Just watch him rising from the swamp to embrace her, unaware the minx is already plotting his downfall … This epic-length TV film is one of the most faithful adaptations of Stoker’s novel. Jourdan plays Dracula as an ageing, slightly regretful matinee idol (with hairy palms!) who relishes his lack of reflection instead of trying to hide it. The special effects are primitive by today’s standards, but the sight of Jourdan crawling down his castle wall is truly unnerving. Werner Herzog goaded Kinski into throwing his daily tantrums before shooting, so the actor would be exhausted by the time the cameras rolled. This resulted in one of his more restrained performances, as a plague spreader tormented by helpless envy of the humans upon whom he preys. Not so much a remake of the 1922 classic as an elegant reframing of it. After 90 years taking in Hammer, Lestat de Lioncourt and Twilight, it is Lugosi – with his tuxedo, piercing gaze and menacing Hungarian accent – who remains the archetypal Dracula. The Spanish version, shot at night on the same sets, might be the more visually fluent film, but its star, Carlos Villarías, is no substitute for Lugosi in his signature role. Schreck plays Dracula in all but name – he is Graf Orlok, possibly for copyright reasons. A hideous bald cadaver with pointy teeth, he is the perfect antidote to pretty-boy vampires, although it doesn’t stop the self-sacrificing heroine surrendering herself to him with an erotic abandon notably lacking from the scenes with her human husband. The true successor to Schreck and Lugosi played Dracula more than any other actor, including in a Jerry Lewis comedy, with a grey moustache in Jess Franco’s Count Dracula (1970) and speaking French in Dracula Père et Fils (1976). But it was in Hammer’s dark fairytales that Lee made the character his own: tall, dark and fanged, an impeccable combination of sexy and scary.",Arts/Film,Count Draculas on film – ranked!,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/03/count-draculas-on-film-ranked

At the time, they were both immersed in the art world: Strong as director of the National Portrait Gallery and, later, the Victoria and Albert Museum; Oman as a production designer for film, theatre, ballet and opera. Their life-long appreciation for art and staging is evident throughout this scintillating, autobiographical garden.

Forty years ago, the meditation master, Maitreya, began to transform a flat field in Nottinghamshire into a miniature Japanese landscape. With no previous gardening experience and a miniature JCB, he began reshaping the earth, creating ponds and mounds and winding paths for visitors to enjoy and explore. Over the years, friends and locals have contributed to the creation and the garden now has a pagoda, a minimalist Zen garden made from chipped marble and a Japanese teahouse. The ponds are full of Koi carp and maple and cherry trees complete the picture. Maitreya’s latest addition to the scheme is a crystal garden – a glittering space for “spiritual inspiration.” Charles Jencks, the cultural theorist, architectural historian, landscape designer and writer, was a renowned promoter of postmodernism. On just one day each year, visitors are admitted to explore his astonishing masterpiece, The Garden of Cosmic Speculation. Begun in 1989 in the grounds of the home he shared with his wife, Maggie Keswick, it’s divided into 40 areas and covers 30 acres. According to Jencks, who died in 2019, the garden “uses nature to celebrate nature, both intellectually and through the senses”. There are visual references to black holes, dark matter and fractal geometry. Other-worldly landforms rise and ripple out of mysterious pools of water, whilst scientific sculptures appear like immersive optional illusions. Date and ticket information for 2022 TBC This ancient sanctuary is a designated World Peace Garden that centres around the Chalice Well – a water source that has flowed ceaselessly for more than 2,000 years. The surrounding land was purchased by the spiritualist, Wellesley Tudor Pole, and preserved to “encourage individual spiritual evolution … to members of the public, of whatever religious persuasion or none, for pilgrimage, quiet contemplation and healing”. The flowing waters that spring from the well have been directed through the “numinous” space, channelled into waterfalls, curving rills and cleansing pools before disappearing underground and coursing towards Glastonbury Abbey. This unfettered oasis – the second largest conservatory in London – provides a verdant, creative space for gallery goers and residents alike. It was built in the early 80s to conceal the concrete stump of the Brutalist fly tower used by the theatre below. (Original, unrealised plans show a giant glass pyramid floating on the lake.) Inside, tree ferns, date palms, coffee and ginger plants form a literal concrete jungle. There’s even an arid house for cacti, succulents and orchids. Koi carp and terrapins moved from Hampstead Heath idle in the shadowy ponds. This mysterious underground garden was buried in rubble after the second world war and rediscovered in 2000. It was initially conceived by “Squire Oakley”, director of the Great Western Railway and fern enthusiast. He created a garden “the likes of which was not known to exist anywhere else” in the late 1800s. Above ground, rock gardens, glass houses, and a panoply of plants, shrubs and trees from around the world delighted visitors. Oakley’s enthusiasm for landscaping continued underground, where he created a subterranean labyrinth of tunnels, grottoes and ferneries, all of which have been fully restored. Less a garden, more a site-specific artwork, Little Sparta lies across seven acres of open moorland of the Pentland Hills. Ian Hamilton Finlay began work here in the late 1960s, enlisting the help of local stone carvers, artists and poets to realise his vision. There are more than 270 artworks to discover. An interactive map on the website gives visitors an idea of the scope and variety of work, which ranges from carved tablets scattered across an undulating lawn, to the huge gilded head of Marsyas, a musical character from Greek mythology who appears half-buried underground. As stimulating as it is contemplative. Plans for The World Garden came about in traumatic circumstances. The horticulturist, Tom Hart Dyke, was on a plant-hunting expedition in the Panamanian jungle when he was kidnapped and held hostage for nine months. During that time, he sketched plans for the garden. After his release in 2000, he began creating a garden of rare and important botanical plants in the grounds of Lullingstone Castle – one of England’s oldest family estates, of which he is the heir. Plant enthusiasts will be able to explore the world in The Cloud Garden, The Cactus House, The Orchid Room and the Moroccan Blue Room (inspired by his visits to the Majorelle Gardens in Marrakech). Rarities include an example of the oldest tree in the world, the Australian dinosaur tree, and the world’s most dangerous plant, the Queensland stinger. An enchanting garden with curious beginnings. Acres of formal gardens flourished at Heligan until the end of the 19th century, when bramble and bracken gradually began to reclaim the site. At the outbreak of the first world war, lives were diverted from the estate and it fell into decades of neglect until 30 years ago, when the gardens were “rediscovered”. In that time, Heligan has been fully restored and now offers the public a second chance to explore a landscape laid out more than two centuries ago. Highlights include the UK’s only outdoor, subtropical jungle planted with bamboo tunnels, tree ferns, giant rhubarb and bananas and a fragrant peach house.",Lifestyle/Life and style,10 enchanted gardens: beautiful and quirky spaces,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/03/10-enchanted-gardens-beautiful-and-quirky-spaces
3/3/2022,"Dear Jacob Rees-Mogg, I have been worrying about the difficulties you face in your new departmental role as minister for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency. On the sidelines you have a job to do in what I called a new department. That is a bit of an exaggeration. I see the address and the telephone number are the same Cabinet Office occupied by David Frost, your predecessor. You are, realistically, the fifth holder of that office in six years. David Davis was appointed by Theresa May to the Department for Exiting the European Union in 2016, followed by Dominic Raab and then Stephen Barclay before it was closed in 2020. It popped up again when Lord Frost was given the grand title of minister of state in the Cabinet Office with oversight of trade and cooperation agreement and withdrawal agreement. He packed it in at the end of last year, complaining to the prime minister about the direction of travel. Now the prime minister has demonstrated great faith in you not only to conjure up the potential of Brexit but, at the same time, to improve government efficiency. I would quietly postpone this aspect of your title if I were you. The chancellor would make a bad enemy when you start poking about in the Treasury to try to find the millions lost to fraud. Perish the thought, but perhaps that’s why the prime minister gave you the title in the first place! You are right about the need to secure cuts by controlling recruitment. Margaret Thatcher was so impressed by the way I did this that she asked me to present my methods to a special meeting of the cabinet. That proved disastrous when the great figures of the time were told by this young ex-businessman that they had to micromanage their departments. The officials advising you won’t have changed much, and that seems to me to be your first problem. I served in different departments for 19 years. I well remember the first day in each new job. There were all those files bursting with outstanding jobs, with new proposals and with lists of manifesto commitments yet to be fulfilled. Sometimes I was even asked if I had any ideas of my own. It all added up to a formidable workload. You will want to be cautious. You are not the first to seek Brexit gold at the rainbow’s end. Theresa May rightly put Eurosceptic colleagues Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox into the top jobs. Davis resigned because May’s deal was no good. Fox said it was the only deal on offer. Johnson left both out of his government and was denounced publicly by Davis in the House of Commons in consequence. Five years after the EU referendum, the baton has passed to you and your Cabinet Office team. Your friends and your supporters in the media will have warned you about these officials. They are an inert, inactive blob, remoaners to every last man and woman, they will say. That is why you have been put in charge. Even a machine as excellent as a Rolls-Royce goes nowhere unless the driver chooses the direction and fills the tank. That is why your appeal to the people themselves to fill this intellectual void – so eloquently expressed in the Sun – was so ingenious. I was at first a sceptic about this constitutional innovation in the democratic process, taking the rather elitist view that that was what ministers were for. That is why I felt compelled to try to help. It is important that your invitation reaches the widest audience. You will not want to rely on a few cranks, or on a regurgitated splurge from Nigel Farage. You will want to protect your career from any such association. So how can we help you to find out what people are really thinking and saying, and thus enable you to reverse the present polls, which reveal that a significant majority of people now think that Brexit is going badly? A key target for your message must be the small entrepreneurs and the larger British companies, which you must show how to exploit the new commercial opportunities. You must not be put off by that cruel cartoon in the Financial Times that showed a microscope on your new desk through which you could find out what these are. I am president of the European Movement, and as our contribution, we are going to provide you with a website that will collect the latest news and allow people to register their advice as you have requested. It is possible that you will not like everything they say, but that is an opportunity for you to use your formidable debating skills to rebut them. You will not be surprised to learn that I was persuaded to make this helpful suggestion by the sort of comments I received in response to my article in the Guardian last month. One told me that Brexit had wrecked his wife’s UK export-to-Europe business. Then there was the report in the Times of the latest survey by the British Chambers of Commerce into the views of its members. A thousand companies were asked to assess the results of Brexit for them; 320 complained of the disadvantages compared with only 59 who were positive. These are the foot soldiers upon whom you have to rely in your ambition to get this great public debate going. You may have noticed that two of your staunchest supporters, the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph, did not print the story at all. I suppose we can console ourselves with the thought that the privilege of a free society is the freedom not to publish what you don’t like. The truth will out. What does it say so far? That the government’s Office for Budget Responsibility has said it expects Brexit to hit the economy twice as hard as the global pandemic. That the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency says that “since the referendum in 2016, 316 companies have chosen the Netherlands because of Brexit”. That the president of the National Farmers’ Union, Minette Batters, believes labour shortages related to the end of free movement without adequate replacement schemes led to “40,000 healthy pigs” being “culled and simply thrown away … an utter disgrace and a disaster for the pig industry”. That the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations says it expects an enormous public relations campaign to portray the deal as a fabulous victory, but that it will inevitably be seen by the fishing industry as a defeat. That the Food and Drink Federation says sales to Europe fell 23.7% in nine months in 2021. Nothing so reveals the reality of Brexit as the meeting of European leaders in Brussels, in the aftermath of Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine. Our continent faces a threat as severe as anything since the end of the cold war. I am ashamed that the country that in my lifetime saved European democracy has now absented itself as others determine Europe’s response. There will, Mr Rees-Mogg, be more councils covering the climate crisis, our environment, international crime, control of the internet. In every case we will be absent. That is what Brexit means.

3/3/2022,"What is the expected scale of the refugee crisis in Ukraine? Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could see the “largest refugee crisis this century”, the UN refugee agency has warned, with up to 4 million people fleeing the country in the coming weeks and months. More than 1 million people have already crossed borders since 24 February, when the Russian invasion began. The 2015 refugee crisis saw 1.3 million people attempt to reach Europe from countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. Where are people going? Domestic civilian flights were cancelled on the first day of the invasion. Since then, people have been heading west into neighbouring countries including Poland, Romania, Moldova and Hungary. More than half – nearly 548,000 – have fled to Poland which shares a 500km border with Ukraine. A further 133,000 have gone to Hungary, 72,000 to Slovakia, 51,260 to Romania, and nearly 98,000 to non-EU Moldova, Europe’s poorest country. A small number, just over 350, have travelled to Belarus. What has been the response of neighbouring countries? In contrast to previous migration waves, neighbouring countries such as Poland and Hungary have opened their borders to everyone fleeing the Russian attacks. However, there have been reports of people of colour trying to flee Ukraine, mostly students from Africa and the Middle East, being pushed back and suffering racial discrimination when trying to cross borders. At the Polish border, people, mostly women and children, are waiting up to 60 hours to cross. Ukrainian men are not allowed to leave as they are legally obliged to help defend the country. The UN refugee agency says conditions are bleak, temperatures are freezing and many are spending days on the road waiting to cross. The Polish authorities have offered comprehensive help to refugees, including free train travel and access to healthcare. Poland also dropped its requirement to show a negative Covid test. Hungary has opened sections of its border that were closed to migration. Moldova already has networks of volunteers providing support and hosting families crossing the border. Germany and Austria are offering free train travel to those seeking to reach their countries. What has been the response across Europe? The EU has reacted with a swift and unified response. By the end of this week, EU member states are expected to have triggered a hitherto unused directive, created in 2001 after the wars in Yugoslavia and Kosovo, known as the Temporary Protection Directive. Designed to operate when the traditional asylum system is overwhelmed, it is expected to give Ukrainian refugees the right to live and work in the EU for up to three years. Ukrainians will also be able to work, access education and housing without having to claim asylum. What has the UK response been so far? So far the UK has struck a different tone to its European neighbours. The government has said it could take in 200,000 or more refugees, if they are relatives of British nationals or Ukrainian people already settled here. Businesses will also be allowed to sponsor a Ukrainian person to come to the UK.",News/Global development,Ukraine’s refugees: how many are displaced and where will they go?,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/03/ukraines-refugees-how-many-are-displaced-and-where-will-they-go
3/3/2022,"Bet365 boss Denise Coates was paid just under £300m in salary and dividends for the first year of the pandemic, as the online gambling firm weathered Covid-19 and benefited from a migration from sports betting as events were cancelled. Accounts filed at Companies House show that Bet365 made a profit of £470m before tax in the year to the end of March 2021, on revenues that were flat at £2.8bn. The cancellation of sporting events as a result of the pandemic led to a “significant migration” to other activities such as virtual sports, slot machines and casino products. Gaming products such as these are associated with significantly higher rates of gambling addiction than sports betting. The company’s highest-paid director, understood to be Denise Coates, was paid £250m. She also has a share of more than 50% of the company’s £97.5m dividend, taking her total compensation for the year to just under £300m. The sum is £170m less than her reward for leading the company a year earlier but takes her pay and dividends over the past five years above £1.3bn.

3/3/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has warned that Europe must become more independent for its own defence and to ensure energy supplies after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The French president said the conflict had “changed the era” across the continent and that he would be calling a summit of European leaders next week to discuss how to address the “unprecedented challenge” it created. In a 14-minute address on prime-time television, he warned France faced upheaval and higher prices and that the country and its European partners had to invest to wean themselves off Russian gas and become self-sufficient in energy production as well as address defence issues and questions about food production. “We can no longer depend on others to feed us, care for us, inform us, finance us,” Macron said. “We cannot depend on others to defend us, whether on land, at sea, under the sea, in the air, in space or in cyberspace. In this respect, our European defence must take a new step forward.” He added: “War in Europe no longer belongs in our history books or schoolbooks, it is here, before our eyes. Democracy is no longer considered an unquestionable system, it is questioned, before our eyes. Our freedom, that of our children, is no longer a given. “To this brutal return of tragedy in history, we must respond with historic decisions.” Macron, who last month had shuttled between Moscow and Kyiv attempting unsuccessfully to prevent the Russian invasion, placed the blame for the war firmly in Putin’s hands, saying Europe and Nato had “done everything to prevent it”. “President Putin chose war … alone, in a deliberate manner and by going back on engagements made to the United Nations. This war is not a conflict between Nato and the west on one side and Russia on the other; there are no Nato troops or bases in Ukraine. That’s just lies. Russia is not being aggressed, it is the aggressor,” he said. “This war is even less what the unfounded propaganda would have you believe, a fight against Nazism. That’s a lie; an insult to the history of Russia and Ukraine, to the memory of our elders who fought side by side against the Nazis. Russian leaders are attacking the memory of the Holocaust in Ukraine as they attack the memory of the crimes of Stalinism in Russia,” Macron added. He accused Putin of having a “revisionist reading of the history of Europe that wants to take us back to the darkest hours of empire, invasions and exterminations”. Macron has said France will welcome Ukrainian refugees and he described the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as “the face of honour, of liberty, or bravery”. The president’s sombre and statesmanlike address on Wednesday evening came as he is expected to announce he is standing for re-election. Candidates have until 6pm French time on Friday to declare. The most recent opinion poll, carried out before his national address, suggests the president is enjoying an unprecedented surge in support, with 28% of voters saying they will support him in the first round election next month, well ahead of his closest rival, the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, on 17%. However, Macron warned there was economic pain to come; the war would hit French agriculture, industry and all economic sectors dependent on the import of raw materials or export of goods to Russia and Ukraine, he said. “The rise in the price of petrol, gas, raw materials will have consequences on our spending power; in future, the price of a tank of petrol, the heating bill, the cost of certain products risks being even higher. Faced with these social and economic consequences, I have but one aim: to protect you.” He said the prime minister, Jean Castex, had been tasked with drawing up an “economic and social resilience plan” to address the difficulties faced by the public. Russia’s attack on Ukraine has given weight to Macron’s long-held belief that the EU should have its own joint defence force. In a major speech at the Sorbonne University in Paris shortly after he was elected in 2017, he said the EU should have “autonomous capacity for action” through a joint military force, shared defence budget and a common defence policy. Any new EU force would be a complement, not a rival, to Nato, he said.",News/World news,"Europe must be more independent and shore up its defence, says Macron",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/europe-must-become-more-independent-shore-up-defence-emmanuel-macron
3/3/2022,"ITV is to launch a new streaming service combining ad-funded and subscription TV shows and films as it aims to become a “national champion” in the battle for British viewers with US streaming giants including Netflix, Amazon and Disney+. ITV, which has told the Russian broadcaster of the local version of I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here not to broadcast the show this year as part of a programming licensing and sales freeze with the state, said that the new ITVX service will launch in the fourth quarter this year. ITVX will become its new streaming master brand, with the existing free ITV Hub and paid-for, ad-free ITV Hub+ brands to be scrapped while it will also draw on content from BritBox, its international paid streaming joint venture with the BBC. ITV says that the new service, which will be led by free advertising-funded content with an optional subscription tier, will offer viewers a “starry” premiere each week and 15,000 hours of content when it launches in the fourth quarter this year. “We are confident that we will become a UK leader in streaming,” said Carolyn McCall, chief executive at ITV. “Our ambitions in the streaming world are not world domination. It is about being a national champion. It is compelling and our expectations of subscriber numbers have been modelled in a very realistic way.” ITV said that it currently has 1.2m subscribers to ITV Hub+ and Britbox UK, which the BBC is pulling out of as part of the launch of ITVX, while ITV Hub increased registered user accounts by 6% to 34.7m. Netflix has an estimated 14 million paying subscribers in the UK, with rival Amazon’s Prime Video at 12 million and Disney at almost 5 million. ITV said the launch of the new service forms part of a target of doubling streaming viewing, which rose 31% to 630m hours last year and total digital revenues to £750m by 2026. The broadcaster’s share price tumbled more than 14% after the announcement on Thursday morning, making it the second-biggest faller on the FTSE after Russian mining firm Polymetal, as investors balked at yet another costly investment and rebrand to try and develop a viable streaming service to support its traditional linear TV operations. ITV said that it would invest £80m in developing ITVX over the next two years, with a further £180m spent specifically on exclusive digital-first content to lure viewers and subscribers to the service. As a result, ITV’s overall content budget will increase from a forecast of £1.16bn to £1.23bn this year and rise to £1.35bn next year, an increased level that ITV said would become its new normal annual spend. The scale of the challenge facing ITV’s traditional business in the fierce battle for viewers was shown in its annual viewing figures, which showed a 9% fall in hours watched across its TV and streaming services combined to 15.1bn. Viewing of its flagship linear channels dropped 11%, with a 27% increase in ITV Hub hours watched unable to make up for the decline. ITV said it would pay for its increased investment programme with a new cost-savings plan, which includes a “reduction in main channel commissions”. By 2026, in total ITV expects to make £50m in annual savings from a “continued reductions in broadcast supply chain costs, overheads, property rationalisation and further innovation in ITV Studios”. Overall, ITV enjoyed a strong 2021, with pre-tax profits up 48% to £480m thanks to record annual advertising income as businesses looked to return to growth as pandemic restrictions eased. Total revenues rose 24% to £3.4bn fuelled by total ad revenues rising a quarter to £1.95bn.",News/Business,"ITV to take on Netflix, Amazon and Disney+ with new streaming service ",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/03/itv-to-take-on-netflix-amazon-and-disney-with-new-streaming-service
3/3/2022,"Online, Lucy and David are slick and witty. Meeting on an app called Tingle Dating, they are forthright and fun. Their texts are heavy on innuendo, every winky face matched by an aubergine emoji. They are witty and sexually assured. In real life, things are more awkward in Michael Southan’s play. A fall from her wheelchair after colliding with a kerb lands Lucy in hospital. A romantic dinner loses its lustre when the wine spills over. And you are unlikely ever to see a sex scene as fumbling and flat as their first night away in a caravan in Minehead. Their swaggering online personas would never admit to such vulnerabilities. Nor would they acknowledge the messy business of human relationships. For a good chunk of this 90-minute romcom, the two can’t help but offend each other. As Lucy, Maya Coates irritates Jack Hunter’s David by claiming an independence she doesn’t have. He winds her up with a retaliatory lie about a busy social life. Before they can fall for each other, they have to find faith in themselves. And that’s not easy when so much stands in their way. The kerbs of the title are also the curbs on their freedom. It is more than bad pavement design that poses an obstacle to their self-fulfilment. As people with disabilities, it is also their reliance on others. Lucy is 24 but her relationship with her mother (Rekha John-Cheriyan) has the cantankerous edge of someone 10 years younger. She is infantilised by her primary carer even as she depends on her. The relationship is a curb on her social life, her privacy and her sexual expression. Staged by Nickie Miles-Wildin for Graeae, the Belgrade theatre and Coventry UK City of Culture 2021, the show has rough edges: it is prone to abrupt changes in mood and narrative digressions and, although the flat-screen set by Amanda Mascarenhas is neat and adaptable, there is no such economy in the number of props the cast are burdened with. But Southan also writes with tenderness, while Coates and Hunter earn their finale fireworks as they go charmingly from emotionally fragile to sexually fulfilled.
