1/30/2022,"After a run of just over four years, a restaurant in West Boise has abruptly shuttered. Pho Tay Vietnamese Noodles, 10548 W. Fairview Ave., closed recently after being evicted. Opened in December 2017, the locally owned restaurant became the third Asian dining option at Fairview Plaza West. A few doors down are China Grand Buffet, a longtime staple, and Rotary Sushi, which opened in 2015. A popular Vietnamese street food, pho is made with noodles, broth, meat and herbs. The dish has become increasingly popular in the Boise area over the past few years. But Pho Tay eventually faced financial challenges. The situation ended with owner Long Duc Do being escorted from the premises on Jan. 19 by Ada County sheriff’s deputies, according to court records. The deputies found Do inside the restaurant after the Sheriff’s Office had posted an eviction notice informing him that he could be charged with trespassing if he or other restaurant employees went inside. Do signed a five-year lease in August 2017, according to a copy included in the eviction lawsuit filed in Ada County Magistrate Court. He was to pay the landlord a base rent of $29,600 per year. The amount increased annually, rising to $33,315 in the final year of the lease, scheduled to expire Dec. 31, 2022. Landlord FPWM LLC of Meridian sued to evict Pho Tay after the restaurant owed $19,099 in rent dating back to Nov. 14, 2019, according to court documents. FPWM LLC presented Do with a notice of default in early November, followed by a three-day notice to pay what was owed or leave the premises. The eviction suit was filed Dec. 14, after Do failed to make any subsequent payments. Magistrate Michael Dean signed a default judgment after Do failed to show up for a hearing on Dec. 28. FPWM LLC was awarded the back rent plus $1,500 in attorney fees. The landlord declined to comment for this article, according to a representative of Colliers commercial real estate company. An email and a text message to Do were not returned.",U.S./Idaho Statesman,This Boise restaurant has closed.

1/30/2022,"Spotify’s market value dropped more than $2 billion in the last few days after Neil Young pulled his music over Joe Rogan’s podcast. Shares have tumbled around 12% from where it closed last week. Young had pulled his songs from the music platform on Wednesday because, he said, Spotify had become “a very damaging force” in spreading misinformation about COVID. Young referred to an open letter from medical professionals earlier this month that urged Spotify to crack down on COVID misinformation on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast. ”They can have Rogan or Young. Not both,“ the music legend wrote in a now-deleted letter that was provided to Rolling Stone. “I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines – potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them,” Young wrote. “Please act on this immediately today and keep me informed of the time schedule.” Spotify shares dropped around 6% after Wednesday. While much of the market has been down in the last week, Spotify’s losses were more significant due to the criticism over Rogan’s show and Young’s move. This is not the first time critics have gone after “The Joe Rogan Experience” for its controversial slants of news and politics, especially with the pandemic. The podcast moved off of Apple in September 2020 in a deal estimated to be worth $100 million, then it became a Spotify exclusive later that year. Earlier this month, a group of more than 260 health and science professionals called on Spotify to take action against “mass-information events” on its app, singling out Rogan for repeatedly spreading misleading and false claims on his show. The show has promoted the use of ivermectin to treat COVID and discouraged vaccination in young people. And it’s also not the first time Young has stripped the streamer of his music. In 2019, he told Rolling Stone that he had removed most of his music from Spotify several years earlier because he felt the sound quality wasn’t good, but he later relented. Peter Frampton showed his support of Young’s decision Thursday, tweeting, “Good for you Neil. I’ve always been an Apple guy for streaming. No Joe Rogan for me thank you! @neilyoung@SpotifyUSA.” And on Friday, Joni Mitchell said in a statement on her website that she will also pull her music from Spotify in protest and “stand in solidarity” with Neil Young. “I’ve decided to remove all my music from Spotify. Irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives,” Mitchell said.",World/The Wrap,Spotify Loses $2 Billion as Stock Plummets After Neil Young’s Joe Rogan Protest,https://news.yahoo.com/spotify-loses-2-billion-stock-182108629.html

1/30/2022,"Trump dropped the biggest hint yet that he'll run for president again in 2024. NGA Chairman Asa Hutchinson, the Republican governor of Arkansas, is against that idea. He told Insider Trump shouldn't lead Republicans or the country again. The Republican chairman of the National Governors Association said on Saturday that Donald Trump should not lead Republicans or the country again. ""I do not believe Trump is the one to lead our party and our country again, as president,"" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson told Insider on the sidelines of the NGA Winter Meeting in Washington, DC. Insider asked Hutchinson whether he wants Trump to run following a video that recently surfaced in which Trump declares on the golf course that he is ""the 45th and the 47th"" president. Asked who should lead instead, Hutchinson said ""that's what the election is all about."" There's many choices out there, he added. ""And, you know, the Republican Party has many different voices,"" Hutchinson said. ""And it's important in this time to have those voices and they should be concentrating on this election cycle."" Hutchinson, a two-term governor, was one of the first Republican governors to publicly push Trump to start a transition process with President Joe Biden after the 2020 election. He has said that Trump's continued attempts to discredit the 2020 election results could be a ""disaster"" for Republican candidates running for office this year. ""I've made it clear: This is about the future,"" he told Insider. ""It's not about the past elections."" Earlier, he told reporters, ""I don't believe the election was stolen. I respect the results."" Trump's golf course comments are the latest, and perhaps most pointed, in a series of hints that he plans to run for president in 2024. To become an official candidate, Trump would have to raise or spend more than $5,000 specifically in support of a presidential campaign effort to officially register as a presidential candidate, according to Federal Election Commission guidelines.

1/30/2022,"The management at the Landing Event Center in Loveland didn't know much about the event that was scheduled for Sunday, the general manager told The Enquirer. Just that a client asked to rent the space for an event that involved ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author and Senate candidate J.D. Vance. Then on Thursday, General Manager Jodi Taylor logged on to her computer. A flood of messages on social media and emails greeted her from people angry about the event. And calls started coming in. The event was a ""meet-and-greet"" with J.D. Vance and controversial Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who just endorsed Vance. The event has been moved from the Landing Event Center in Loveland to the Marriott Cincinnati Northeast in Mason. In an email, Vance's campaign said the event was moved due to a large number of RSVPs. The change in venues highlights the difficult situation political events create for venue owners. After discussing it with the owners, the management felt they weren't in a position to hold the event, Taylor said. She said they didn't know it was open to the public and would have an unknown number of people, she said. ""We just chose to respect it was a very emotional topic,"" Taylor said. ""People are passionate about what they believe. We were wrapping our heads around what was going on. We didn't know there would be a guest."" They asked Vance's campaign to find another location. Then management posted a notice on its Facebook page. ""Due to the tremendous interest in the JD Vance presentation that was scheduled to take place here this Sunday, it has been relocated to the Marriott NE located in Deerfield Twp. We appreciate everyone's interest and concerns."" The Landing Event Center didn't want to jump into the politics, Taylor said. ""It doesn’t matter what we do,"" Taylor said. ""We have both sides upset."" Activists are now trying to stop Greene and Vance's appearance in Mason. The Mason-Deerfield Township Democratic Club and others have shared a link encouraging people to call the Marriott, reserve seats to take up space and ask the Mason mayor to take a stand. As of Saturday morning, the event is still a go for Mason, according to Vance's campaign. Please help by sending a message that Greene & Vance’s racism, bigotry, hatred, and division have no place here in Mason! @imaginemason @madechamber @CinciMarriottNE @Marriott @GregLandsman @TimRyan @mh4oh @OPSU_PAC @WarrenCoDemsOH @nanwhaley @DavidPepperhttps://t.co/RTai87r3OU — Mason-Deerfield Twp Democrats Club (@masondfdems) January 29, 2022 Greene has attracted controversy in the year since she took office.
