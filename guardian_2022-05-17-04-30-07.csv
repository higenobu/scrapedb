5/17/2022,"Awhite teenager and avowed racist beelines to a Black neighborhood and fatally guns down 10 supermarket patrons. But what most troubled the pure minds of the right’s leading thinkers? Baby formula, among other things. For the most prominent conservative voices, the major takeaway from last Saturday’s shooting in Buffalo, New York, was not it being one of the worst hate crimes in American history. Or an indictment of gun control legislation. Or an impetus for tighter controls around online forums that provide quarter to bigots and their unhinged plans of mass destruction. No, their major takeaway was literally anything else. Tucker Carlson – who has openly discussed the idea of whites being replaced, a point that was raised in the shooter’s manifesto – could not even be bothered to weigh in on the shooting over the weekend; his Twitter feed was stuck on a Friday post about the baby formula shortage and included a clip from his rant about it on his Fox News show. Laura Ingraham was far more prolific on Twitter, but kept the conversation to her pet subjects: the Putin problem, the “wokeism” crisis and larger leftist conspiracy. Charlie Kirk, a 28-year-old talkshow host who routinely promotes conspiracy theories, stuck to a familiar script too – banging on about how Ukraine is getting all the government funding that should be going toward building a wall, when he wasn’t wondering why the recent firebombing of a Wisconsin pro-choice clinic had not been categorized as a hate crime. Republican lawmakers have been similarly loth to acknowledge the obvious. Per usual, it’s fallen to Wyoming’s Liz Cheney to scold her party for tacitly inflaming white nationalist and antisemitic rhetoric. “History has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse.” Still, her peers’ lack of words for the Buffalo massacre is telling, a departure from the usual round of thoughts and prayers. After years of being sharply criticized for those empty gestures, apparently conservatives now think it wiser to say nothing at all. But there’s a difference between keeping mum out of respect and talking around the subject seemingly out of spite. And given the shooter’s tight embrace of the fringe notions that have been mainstreamed by the right – not least, the great replacement theory – perhaps the right’s most outspoken members have reason to change the subject. To the baby formula shortage. To soaring fuel prices. To war in Ukraine. To any other crisis, real or imagined, except the most urgent one. When it comes to the sanctity of life in gestation, of course, they’re happy to fume freely about that … but when that loss occurs outside the womb, in a mass shooting? Well, ain’t that America. Nothing to see here than just another tragedy in a depressingly long line that traces back to the Charleston shooting, to the 16th street Baptist Church Bombing, to the Tulsa Masscare – to the very founding of this country. And saying something constructive or otherwise risks light on a painful subject that, sadly, is nowhere close to changing.",News/US news,"After Buffalo race massacre, rightwing pundits focus on … anything else | Andrew Lawrence",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/right-wing-conservative-reaction-buffalo-shooting
5/17/2022,"The US will send up to 500 soldiers back on full-time deployment to Somalia, to train the country’s army to combat the increasing threat posed by al-Shabaab militants. The White House insisted that the move, deepening the US long-term military commitment in an intractable foreign conflict, did not contradict Joe Biden’s overall policy of disengaging from “forever wars”, which underlay the withdrawal from Afghanistan. The decision does not affect overall deployments in the region, officials said on Monday, but replaces a rotating deployment with a “persistent” presence – longer tours by the same special forces soldiers. They argued the deployment should not be called permanent, as that implied the soldiers would be there forever. The move marks a reversal of Donald Trump’s abrupt decision, in the last weeks of his presidency, to withdraw 750 US troops who had been stationed in Somalia until then. A senior administration official called Trump’s decision “irrational”. “It was an abrupt and sudden transition to a rotational presence,” the official said. “Since then, al-Shabaab, the terrorist group in Somalia that is al-Qaida’s largest, wealthiest and deadliest affiliate, has unfortunately only grown stronger. It has increased the tempo of its attacks, including against US personnel.” The official said that having a rotational presence had increased the security risks to US troops as they moved in and out of the country, and had disrupted the training of Somali forces by constantly changing the US trainers. The White House said that the deployment would be “fewer than 500” soldiers. The New York Times reported that the cap would be 450. The aim will be to boost the capacity of Somali forces to disrupt al-Shabaab sufficiently so the group is not able to plot attacks against the US, such as the January 2020 assault on the American airbase at Manda Bay in Kenya. That same month, US prosecutors charged a Kenyan national with involvement in an al-Shabaab plot to carry out a 9/11-style attack on a US city. The Kenyan had been trying to learn how to fly large planes in the Philippines when he was arrested. The Pentagon proposed the change some months ago, and Biden is reported to have approved the decision earlier this month, but the timing of the announcement was determined in part by the re-election by the country’s parliament on Sunday of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, ending months of uncertainty. Outgoing president Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed’s term ended in February 2021 without an election. The protracted dispute that followed turned violent at times and caused divisions at the highest levels of government. On Monday, the United Nations, the African Union, the EU and diplomats congratulated Mohamud and expressed hopes that his election would enable political reconciliation. “This is someone with whom we are familiar given that he served as president 2012 to 2017,” the senior US official said. “Maybe even more importantly, I would say that across Somali leadership there is consistency in terms of support for collaboration on counter-terrorism.” The official suggested the decision had taken time because of Biden’s caution over sending US troops into a conflict zone. “He takes seriously his obligation to ask tough questions and to make sure he understands the full ramifications – the risks as well as the potential benefits,” the official said. “Once he worked through that process, once he had his questions answered, he was ultimately comfortable approving this proposal from the secretary of defence.”",News/US news,Biden reverses Trump withdrawal of US army trainers from Somalia,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/us-military-somalia-al-shabaab-biden-trump
5/17/2022,"The government’s counter-terrorism programme has been too focused on rightwing extremism and should now crack down on Islamism, according to leaked draft extracts from a landmark review of the Prevent strategy. In one particularly provocative recommendation, seen by the Guardian, the review claims there has been a “double standard” approach to tackling different forms of extremism, with individuals targeted for expressing mainstream rightwing views because the definition of neo-nazism has expanded too widely, while the focus on Islamism has been too narrow. The leaks, from the government-commissioned Prevent review being carried out by Sir William Shawcross, are likely to be deeply controversial. They come days after a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, where a self-confessed white supremacist shot 11 black and two white victims in what authorities described as a “racially motivated hate crime”. Sir Peter Fahy, the former police lead for Prevent, said the review extracts suggested Shawcross’s findings were an unwarranted attempt to “politicise counter-terrorism policing” and it was “quite dangerous to play off one ideology against another”. The draft Shawcross review also claims that: a renewed focus on Islamist extremism is needed, including when individuals do not yet meet the terrorism threshold. individuals have been referred to Prevent, the government’s anti-extremism programme, to access mental health support even when there is no evidence of extremism. some Prevent-funded groups have promoted extremist narratives including support for the Taliban. The long-delayed review by Shawcross, which was delivered to the Home Office at the end of April, has already drawn criticism from civil society groups, dozens of whom have declined to participate. Shawcross, a former head of the charity watchdog, has made controversial comments about Islam. In 2012, as a director of the neoconservative thinktank the Henry Jackson Society, he said: “Europe and Islam is one of the greatest, most terrifying problems of our future. I think all European countries have vastly, very quickly growing Islamic populations.” The number of referrals to Prevent relating to far-right extremism exceeded those for Islamist radicalisation for the first time last year. Referrals for far-right threats from the Prevent programme to Channel, which provides more intensive intervention, had already outstripped Islamist radicalisation since 2020. In Shawcross’s draft review of the Prevent programme, he argues that its purpose must be refocused and says its first objective, to tackle the causes of radicalisation and respond to the ideological challenge of terrorism, “is not being sufficiently met”. It argues that the programme must re-engage with individuals who are not yet posing a terror threat but who can “create an environment conducive to terrorism”. One extract says Prevent has a “double standard when dealing with extreme rightwing and Islamism”. It says the programme has taken an expansive view on rightwing terror, which has “been so broad it has included mildly controversial or provocative forms of mainstream, rightwing-leaning commentary that have no meaningful connection to terrorism or radicalisation”. However, it says a more hardline approach should be taken towards Islamist extremism, and that the programme has concentrated on proscribed organisations, “ignoring Islamist narratives”. The draft review is also critical of Prevent-funded civil society organisations and community projects, suggesting funding is misallocated to “generic” projects and few “could be seen to publicly contest extremist discourse”. It found that some Prevent-funded programmes “have promoted extremist narratives, including statements that appear supportive of the Taliban”. The draft says: “As a core principle, the government must cease to engage with or fund those aligned with extremism.” Another extract says Prevent is “carrying the weight” for overstretched mental health services and that vulnerable people have been referred in order to access other forms of support even when they do not pose a terror threat. It is understood that the report has been finalised by Shawcross and his team. It is still to be fact-checked before being subjected to legal checks in case any person or group can claim they have been libelled, which would potentially expose the Home Office, which picked Shawcross for the role despite extensive misgivings, to paying out legal damages. Fahy, a former chief constable of Greater Manchester police and head of Prevent until 2015, told the Guardian: “There is a danger of policing thought as opposed to the risk of violence. It is not about ideology but about the risk someone will cross into violence. “It is about threat, risk and harm. We know there has been an increase in far-rightwing extremism in the UK. The worst terrorist attack in Europe was by a rightwing terrorist, Anders Breivik. “It sounds to me quite dangerous to play off one ideology against another. There is a danger this is an attempt to politicise counter-terrorism policing. How are the police supposed to judge what is mainstream? Police operate on what is the likelihood of this person being drawn into violence, not whether their views are mainstream.” The draft extracts are also likely to raise eyebrows in the intelligence services. Ken McCallum, the domestic spy agency’s director general, recently warned that extreme rightwing terrorism accounted for one in five of all counter-terrorism investigations, a threat that had “grown and morphed quite substantially over the last five to 10 years”. A particular problem, he said, was the “high prevalence” of teenagers in rightwing terrorism investigations, which he suggested was because youngsters were being swept up in a “toxic ideology” of “online extremists and echo chambers”. The Home Office has proscribed a number of far-right groups in recent years, including the neo-Nazi group Sonnenkrieg Division, members of which have been jailed for serious offences. It also recognised the extreme rightwing group System Resistance Network as an alias of the already proscribed organisation National Action. Prevent came under renewed scrutiny after the murder of the Conservative MP David Amess, who was stabbed to death in his constituency surgery by Ali Harbi Ali, who said he was motivated by Islamist extremism. His murder last year was followed by another Islamist attack on Liverpool women’s hospital. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Prevent remains a vital tool for early intervention and safeguarding. We will not allow extremists or terrorists to spread hate or sow division, and Prevent remains an important driver to help divert people away from harm. “The independent review of Prevent, led by William Shawcross, will ensure we continue to improve our response and better protect people from being drawn into poisonous and dangerous ideologies. The report is currently being finalised and once formally received and after full consideration, the report and the government’s response to it will be published.”",News/UK news,Leaked Prevent review attacks ‘double standards’ on far right and Islamists,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/leaked-prevent-review-attacks-double-standards-on-rightwingers-and-islamists
5/17/2022,"The Duke of Sussex has urged world leaders to prevent social media companies from using children as “digital experiments to make money”, as he supported calls for legislation to rein in tech firms. Prince Harry said the social media industry makes unbelievable amounts of money by “vacuuming” up time and information from users, adding that children should “demand better”. “We want all children to feel empowered to speak up and demand change,” he said at the virtual launch of a global child online safety toolkit hosted by UK campaign group the 5Rights Foundation. “We’re at a critical moment where it will take all of us for children to thrive in the digital world.” Harry said the world needed new digital laws to protect children, such as those being introduced in California, the EU and the UK. In the UK the government is pushing through the online safety bill requiring tech firms to protect children and adults from harmful online content. “We need new laws. We need public pressure. We need strong leadership,” he said. The prince also said there should be research into what information companies are hiding behind closed doors, in an apparent reference to the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who revealed last year that the social media company knew its content was causing harm to young users. Harry added that he and his wife, Meghan, were concerned about their children being part of the “next generation growing up in a world where they are treated as digital experiments for companies to make money and where things like hatred and harm are somehow normalised”. The prince has criticised social media companies in the past for failing to tackle problems on their platforms. Last year he said “time is running out” for the industry to address misinformation which he believes is a threat to democracies. Beeban Kidron, chair of 5Rights Foundation, which provides policy guidance on keeping children safe online, said: “Guaranteeing online safety is not just about responding to risks and harms: it means actively designing a digital environment that is safe for every child. “This toolkit provides lawmakers with everything they need to step up and respond to their obligation to keep children safe online. All the tools are there, so policymakers can put them to use and make child online safety a reality.”",News/UK news,Prince Harry speaks out at ‘critical moment’ for children’s online safety,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/prince-harry-speaks-out-at-critical-moment-for-childrens-online-safety
5/17/2022,"Élisabeth Borne, who has been appointed France’s first woman prime minister in more than 30 years, has a reputation as a technocrat with a long career in many different government ministries and local administrations. She is experienced in negotiating with trade unions, seen as crucial as Emmanuel Macron prepares an overhaul of the pensions and benefits system which could lead to street protests. The 61-year-old engineer, who had previously headed Paris’s state transport company, RATP, was fiercely loyal to the centrist president during his first term, when she served as minister for transport, environment and finally labour from 2020. Borne, who describes herself as a “woman of the left” has been a regular in the corridors of French power for several decades, serving as an adviser to ministers on under François Mitterrand and advising the Socialist environment minister Ségolène Royal in 2014. She also worked on urban planning at Paris city hall under the leftwing mayor Bertrand Delanoë. During Macron’s first term in office, Borne often contested the view that the pro-business president had veered from his stance of “neither left nor right” to firmly centre right. Borne, who describes herself as driven by “social justice and equal opportunities” would repeat Macron’s argument that “helping everyone to free themselves through work is a value of the left”. She told Le Figaro last year: “Social democracy is still alive and it’s the president who is leading it.” Borne was raised in Paris. Her mother was from Normandy and the daily Libération has reported that her father was Jewish with Russian roots, from a family who had taken refuge in France in 1939. A member of the French Resistance, he was deported in 1942 and died in 1972, when she was a child. When Borne served as the first female prefect of the western region of Poitou-Charentes, as she signed her first decree of French naturalisation for a person who had obtained citizenship, she reportedly cited her own family roots which she said symbolised the integration of refugees in France. Known to discreetly vape, even in parliament, Borne was regularly on television at the height of the Covid pandemic to remind French people to work from home and defend the government’s job protection scheme. She has said, however, that she is not interested in putting herself centre-stage, and Ifop poll last month found she was not a household name. Forty-five per cent of respondents said they didn’t know who she was. Borne was admitted to hospital with Covid in March 2021 and was administered oxygen, an experience she described as nerve-wracking. She is said to be precise on technical detail. She is a lover of maths, saying she finds in numbers “something quite reassuring, quite rational”. Agence France-Presse said that behind the scenes in the ministries where she served, she was nicknamed “Borne out” for the demands she made of her collaborators, a play on words with “burn out”.",News/World news,Élisabeth Borne: a long-serving technocrat and ‘woman of the left’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/elisabeth-borne-a-long-serving-technocrat-and-woman-of-the-left
5/17/2022,"Boris Johnson has said a legal move to ditch parts of the Northern Ireland protocol is only an “insurance” policy, as it emerged that the controversial legislation has been delayed for some weeks. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, is expected to give a combative statement on Tuesday threatening to bring forward the draft legislation, after a cabinet discussion on Northern Ireland. However, the timetable for the draft laws has now slipped, with the text now only promised before the summer break, according to Whitehall sources. The prime minister came under sharp criticism from all sides on Monday when he flew into Belfast in an effort to revive the devolved government at Stormont, amid the continuing row over the protocol. One of the major sticking points is the protocol aligning Northern Ireland’s trade with the EU rather than the rest of the UK, with the DUP refusing to return to power-sharing without major changes. During his visit, Johnson said he was committed to negotiations with the EU on the protocol but that he would not be dragging his heels on potential legislation if talks did not result in a solution. He said: “We would love this to be done in a consensual way with our friends and partners, ironing out the problems, stopping some of these barriers east-west. “But to get that done, to have the insurance, we need to proceed with a legislative solution as well.” Johnson said the UK does not want to “scrap” the Northern Ireland protocol, but believes it can be “fixed”. He told broadcasters during a trip to Belfast: “We don’t want to scrap it. But we think it can be fixed.And actually five of the five parties I talked to today also think it needs reform.” No 10 has not appeared to be as keen as Truss on the option of legislation to undermine the protocol in recent days. One diplomatic source said one of the prime minister’s top aides had been privately telling people that the government was very committed to negotiations and no decision had been taken on pressing ahead with the legislation. Within the UK’s Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU, the Northern Ireland protocol lays out arrangements that effectively keep Northern Ireland in the single market, drawing a customs border between it and the rest of the UK, with checks on goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That means there is no requirement for checks across the UK's land border with Ireland. The 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal requires keeping the land border open and that there be no new infrastructure such as cameras and border posts. However. both the British government and the European Union recognise that the implementation of this deal has triggered the disruption of supply chains, increased costs and reduced choice for consumers in Northern Ireland.  The rules means that goods such as milk and eggs have to be inspected when they arrive in Northern Ireland from mainland Britain, while some produce, such as chilled meats, cannot be imported at all. This is because the EU does not want to risk them entering the single market over the land border and then being transported on. What is article 16? Article 16 is an emergency brake in the Irish protocol, that allows either side to take unilateral action if the protocol is causing “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist”, or diversion of trade. Serious difficulties are not defined, giving both sides leeway for interpretation.  This would launch a process defined in the treaty as “consultations … with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution”. Article 16 is meant to be a temporary timeout, not an escape hatch. Delegations from the five main political parties questioned Downing Street’s credibility and post-Brexit strategy after meeting Johnson in separate back-to-back talks at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. Several hundred protesters outside the castle set the mood by jeering the prime minister’s cavalcade and holding placards saying “Back off Boris!” Downing Street had expressed hope of calming tensions heightened by the DUP blocking an assembly and executive at Stormont in protest at the Irish Sea border. Instead rhetoric escalated, with Sinn Féin, the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) and Alliance accusing Johnson of not acting in the interests of Northern Ireland. Several delegations questioned the point of the visit. Downing Street had signalled hope that a move towards potentially overriding parts of the protocol would encourage the DUP to make a swift return to Stormont but the party leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, insisted only actions, not words, would revive the Good Friday agreement institutions. “The DUP has a mandate to see the protocol replaced with arrangements that restore our place within the UK internal market. Our mandate will be respected.” The tone reinforced signals from DUP sources who said the party will need more than an announcement of legislation to override the protocol – it will need legislation to clear hurdles at Westminster and appear on track to become law. While the DUP publicly doubted the value of Johnson’s word, Sinn Féin accused him of complicity with the DUP in obstructing devolved government. “The British government is in a game of brinkmanship with the European institutions, indulging a section of political unionism which believes it can frustrate and hold society to ransom,” said the party leader, Mary Lou McDonald, after meeting the prime minister. She said he gave “no straight answers” during a “very tough meeting”. Most of the protesters outside Hillsborough were nationalists who demanded that Johnson protect the protocol. Others were campaigners for an Irish language act and for justice for relatives of people killed during the Troubles, two additional controversies confronting Downing Street. Johnson put on a brave face after the meetings. “Everybody should be rolling up their sleeves and getting stuck into the government of Northern Ireland,” he told reporters during a visit to Thales, an air defence manufacturer in east Belfast. Naomi Long, leader of Alliance, the third biggest party, said most people and businesses in Northern Ireland favoured pragmatic solutions to the protocol. “Despite this, the foreign secretary will make a statement tomorrow to set the scene on unilaterally making changes to the protocol. That is not the way to business. Trust is the key ingredient and that involves keeping agreements, not breaking them. There is talk about safe landing zones on this matter. But as the pilot, Boris Johnson and the UK government is poised to crash the plane tomorrow.” Colum Eastwood, the MP and SDLP leader, said he had a “robust” meeting with the prime minister. “Boris Johnson’s actions over the last two years and his words today is so great that it makes it impossible to trust the prime minister. He has recklessly used this place to serve his own narrow political interests and once again he is on the verge of overriding the interests of the majority of people here for his own ends.” Another UK source suggested that there was an “a priori” issue with the protocol as it needed to be re-opened for issues such as governance but this was not the same as scrapping it. The UK’s proposal to soften the role of the European court of justice and make an EU-UK arbitration board the first port of call in disputes would require a section of the protocol to be re-opened with new wording approved by each.",News/UK news,"Plan to scrap parts of Northern Ireland protocol is only an ‘insurance policy’, says Boris Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/plan-to-scrap-parts-of-northern-ireland-protocol-is-only-an-insurance-policy-says-boris-johnson
