4/1/2022,"The New South Wales Labor party has helped pass a bill that could see protesters who block roads, ports or rail in the state spend up to two years in jail, despite outrage from unions and environmental groups. After being forced to call an extra sitting day, thanks to the Greens mounting a filibuster attempt, the government was able to pass the bill into law with Labor’s backing on Friday, just two days after it first introduced the legislation into parliament. The bill introduces fines of up to $22,000 and up to two years in jail for anyone found to have blocked roads, ports or other major infrastructure such as train lines in a way which “seriously disrupts or obstructs vehicles or pedestrians”. Introduced in response to a series of climate protests during which activists blockaded the Port of Botany and major roads including the Spit Bridge near Manly, the bill saw a wave of condemnation from environmental and human rights groups, which have questioned its constitutionality. The head of Unions NSW, Mark Morey, also described it as “unacceptable”. But despite the reservations of some on the Labor backbench, the opposition leader, Chris Minns, gave an impassioned speech in support of the bill when it returned to the lower house on Friday afternoon. Condemning their climate protests as “guerrilla activity”, Minns attacked Blockade Australia for partaking in “anarchy for anarchy’s sake”. “It’s not like coal barons are the people being affected by these protests, it’s ordinary people going about their lives and trying to earn a living,” he said. Earlier in the upper house, Labor moved a series of amendments that carved out industrial action from the bill and provided exemptions for protesters who block roads outside of parliament or MPs’ offices. The Greens noted that Labor initially opposed the latter amendments when they were put forward this week. Other amendments put by Labor – including an exemption for “peaceful protests” – did not receive government support. In parliament the attorney general, Mark Speakman, accused the opposition of having sought to “torpedo the bill” by pushing the change.

But the government was able to pass a motion which saw MPs return for a special sitting day on Friday. After five hours of debate, including unsuccessful attempts by the Greens to carve out other forms of protest from the bill, it passed through the upper house. The Greens upper house MP Abigail Boyd said it was “clearly targeted at silencing particular types of protest and silencing particular people with particular views”. “This silencing of political views should cause the attorney general to be gravely concerned now about the constitutionality of this bill,” she said. She also slammed the opposition for supporting the bill, saying Labor “make plenty of noise about supporting the right to peaceful protest, but it’s clear their solidarity only extends so far”.

But a series of organisations including the Aboriginal Legal Service, the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, the Human Rights Law Centre and the Environmental Defenders Office lined up to slam the legislation after it passed. “The Aboriginal Legal Service was born out of a protest movement in the 1970s. You would be hard pressed to find any win for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights that wasn’t brought about by public protest,” the ALS chair, Mark Davies, said. “The right to assemble and demonstrate in our streets, towns and cities is a fundamental cornerstone of democracy. For marginalised communities, public protests enable us to be seen and heard, even – and especially – when those in power would rather suppress our voices. “We condemn in the strongest terms this government crackdown on our right to protest.”",News/Australia news,Labor helps pass NSW bill targeting road-blocking protesters despite union opposition,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/labor-helps-pass-nsw-bill-targeting-road-blocking-protesters-despite-union-opposition
4/1/2022,"The field is almost complete for the eight-player 2022 Candidates at Madrid in June, which will decide Magnus Carlsen’s next world title challenger. It promises to be a vintage occasion. The event which remains in the memory among recent Candidates is London 2013, when Carlsen and Vlad Kramnik battled to become Vishy Anand’s challenger. Both made a hash of the final round before the Norwegian won through. Now, in 2022, there are at least four players who can be argued as favourites. China’s world No 2, Ding Liren, looks poised to qualify for the final spot in Madrid. Ding had seemed out of contention due to visa issues, but Sergey Karjakin’s ban created a vacancy if Ding could complete a 30 games requirement by the end of April. This week Ding is at Hangzhou for a four-GM event where he will play 12 games, followed by a six-game match against China’s No 2, Wei Yi, and then a 10-game training tournament. Some days will have two rounds, and Ding’s hectic marathon will be complete by 24 April, before the cut-off date for Fide’s May rating list. Ding’s 6.5/7 start in Hangzhou has regained his world No 2 spot from the prodigy Alireza Firouzja, who has been inactive recently but is probably at work on preparing opening bombs ready for the Candidates. A few months ago Hikaru Nakamura seemed to have abandoned classical chess completely in favour of his booming career as a streamer with more than a million followers. Then Fide made its inspired decision to give Nakamura a wildcard for the Berlin leg, and the five-time US champion responded by winning the first Grand Prix leg, before recovering from a poor start in the final leg to score three wins in a row. The Berlin leg will be decided in Sunday’s final, but it is already mathematically sure that Nakamura and Richard Rapport will take the two Candidates qualifier places. The expected Candidates field, with current live ratings, is: 2 Ding Liren (29, China); 3 Alireza Firouzja (18, France); 4 Fabiano Caruana (29, US); 7 Richard Rapport (26, Hungary) 8 Ian Nepomniachtchi (31, Russia); 11 Hikaru Nakamura (34, US); 12 Teimour Radjabov (35, Azerbaijan); 15 Jan-Krzyzsztof Duda (23, Poland). Two months ahead of the tournament, who are the favourites and who are the outsiders? Caruana and Nepomniachtchi have already played for the world crown, Firouzja has been breaking age records in his stellar ascent, while Ding has performed creditably in previous Candidates despite adverse circumstances in 2020-21 when he had to quarantine before the start. This quartet have to be the prime favourites. At the other end, Radjabov has his place as compensation for withdrawing in 2020 due to pandemic concerns, but he was a poor last in the 2013 Candidates. Duda and Rapport are as yet unproven at the highest level, but are young enough for a surge in form. The enigma of the tournament is Nakamura. He could only manage an even score on his one previous Candidates appearance, and it is a major handicap for a player in his mid-30s to have been away from classical tournaments for so long. Yet the dream will be there, the chance to fulfil the promise of eight years ago when the American was No 3 in the world. A remark he made in an interview this week shows how seriously he is already taking the opportunity. Playing White against Shak Mamedyarov in the Grand Prix semi-final and confronted with the Petroff 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nf6, he opted for a tame queen exchange and a speedy draw. Asked why, he replied “the opening is one that many of the people in the Candidates might play”. Meanwhile Carlsen has won both opening events in the online Champions Tour. The No 1’s victory in the last week’s Charity Cup, designed to aid Unicef and Ukraine, seemed to be going smoothly as he outplayed Ding in the semi-finals, won the first set in the final against Duda, and took a 1-0 lead in the second set. Then disaster struck in a way which Carlsen recalled from previous events: “This was right out of the playbook of what feels like every tournament after the first few last year. Seems like I’m cruising, then there’s one bad moment and it all falls apart.” Duda’s resource, which changed the assessment from a white win to a black win, and which visibly rocked the world champion, came after Carlsen advanced 1 a6 in the diagram. What happened next? Solution below. Carlsen went on to lose the next game then the set as well, but recovered to win the blitz tie-break and the final. Overall, his online form is dominant. His next over-the-board tournament could be the St Louis Grand Tour Superbet Classic in Bucharest, Romania, from 3-15 May, or he may wait until Norway Chess at Stavanger starting 30 May. 3809: 1...Qe7! 2 Qxe7 (if 2 Qe5 f6 and Rxg2+ follows) Rxg2+ 3 Kh1 Rg1++! 4 Kxg1 Rg8+ and mates.

4/1/2022,"Nicolas, a 36-year-old courier based in a small town in Suffolk, has started to think the unthinkable: spiralling fuel costs may soon force him out of work. Nicolas (he asked not to use his surname) is one of an 18,000-strong army of self-employed drivers who work for Evri, the company formerly known as Hermes, who is desperate for more financial help to ensure delivering parcels is a viable way to earn a living. But Nicolas claims the private equity-owned company, who he’s delivered for since 2016, is failing to recognise the value couriers bring. On Thursday Evri struck a deal with drivers and the GMB union on fuel allowance that was labelled “insulting” by some. “It’s not just a job, you become part of the community,” said Nicolas, who visits about 75 households a day. “I’ve seen babies grow up and start school, families getting bigger, attended customers’ funerals, been invited to a wedding. During the pandemic, sometimes I was the only person elderly people would see for weeks.” But Nicolas said he’s afraid surging fuel costs will force him out of the job. He now spends roughly £240 a month filling his tank, he said, up from about £180 before the war in Ukraine, but only stands to claw back between £8 and £12 for fuel a month. “I’ve started having to use credit [to buy fuel], going further into debt just so I can work,” Nicolas said. “I don’t see how this changes things.” As fuel costs jump, Evri said many self-employed couriers will receive an average of 2.3p a mile – between 35p and 75p a day, depending on the delivery radius – backdated to 26 March. That means someone working five-days-a-week on the maximum radius would receive £3.75 a week, or £15 every four weeks, for fuel. It replaces a package earlier this month worth just under 2p a mile. “My reaction is shock [and] total disappointment, I feel disheartened and disrespected,” said Amy, a 43-year-old courier for eight years based in Worcestershire, who also asked the Guardian not publish her surname over fear of losing her job. “It makes me really want to leave and find a company that shows a little more empathy.” Fuel costs have hit record highs in recent weeks, driven higher by Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the west’s attempts to wean itself off Russian oil. Last week the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts was 167.3p, according to data firm Experian Catalist, while diesel was 179.7p. Despite the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, cutting 5p off fuel duty, many complain that the discount is not being fully passed on. Further fuel price climbs are expected, piling pressure on courier drivers who are often on gig economy contracts and lack the security of full-time employees. An organiser for GMB acknowledged the package isn’t perfect but said the allowances were a “step in the right direction”. “It’s a helping hand – it isn’t huge amounts, but it’s at least more than just a token from the company,” said Steve Garelick, GMB’s national lead for Evri, who helped negotiate the agreement. Garelick added that Evri has no legal obligation to offer a fuel allowance to couriers in its “self-employed plus” category and acknowledged their willingness to “do the right thing”. “We always want more,” he said. “But we started from zero.” He hailed real progress from the GMB-Evri negotiations, bringing money to couriers’ pockets. Evri earlier this month offered a fuel allowance scheme of just under 2p a mile – between 30 and 40p a day, which was attacked by couriers – that Thursday’s agreement replaces with immediate effect. Other companies, such as Amazon, provide more generous fuel allowances of over 21p a mile in some cases. The row underlines the precarious nature of gig economy work, particularly courier driving, which has ballooned during the pandemic amid a surge in online shopping. Hermes Parcelnet posted a pre-tax profit of £131m in the year to February 2021, more than tripling the £43m the year before, as packages surged during the pandemic. Revenue was almost £1.5bn for the year to February 2021, a roughly 70% jump on £860m the year before. The highest paid director received an aggregate pay package of more than £600,000 last year. In 2020, American private equity group Advent International partnered with management to acquire a 75% stake in what was then trading as Hermes UK. Advent, which bought the defence company Cobham in 2019, renamed Hermes last month, after coming under fire for mishandling parcels. James, a 63-year-old courier in Northamptonshire who joined Evri more than two years ago, said he was spending about £45 a month on fuel last year, but since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine it has soared to about £65. “The fuel situation is horrendous,” said James, who withheld his surname over fears of his role being terminated. He said the low fuel allowance is another instance of the company not valuing its couriers for what can be a physically demanding job. “At the end of the week I definitely feel it,” said James, who is on medication for a heart attack a few years ago. An Evri spokesperson said: “As part of its ongoing review with the GMB union designed to support couriers following the most recent spike in fuel prices, Evri has today announced new payments which … equate to 2.3p per mile on average.” The allowance is structured in four grades: 35p a day (for couriers with an average delivery radius of less than 1 sq mile); 50p (1-5 sq miles); 65p (5-20 sq miles): and 75p (more than 20 sq miles). Evri’s spokesperson added it provides access for couriers to the best fuel cards and it will continue to regularly review fuel prices with GMB to ensure people are paid the “national living wage”. But many couriers are unhappy. “It’s insulting, it feels like a slap in the face,” said Nicola, a 40-year-old courier in South Yorkshire. Nicola said she has worked as a courier for 12 years. “It takes years to build up the experience – knowing which customers want packages left in their sheds, greenhouses, at the backdoor,” she said. “I really don’t want to leave this job, but I’m not making ends meet.”",Lifestyle/Money,‘Insulting’: how inadequate fuel support may force couriers out of work,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/01/insulting-how-inadequate-fuel-support-may-force-couriers-out-of-work
4/1/2022,"Niall always leaves the seat up – it’s really inconsiderate, and it grosses me out I live at with my younger brother, Niall. It’s our family home and we took over the house and bills when our parents retired and moved away. We both have our own bathroom, but share the downstairs loo. Whenever I go in there the toilet seat is up. I hate having to constantly put it down – I shouldn’t have to get germs on my hands for something that isn’t my responsibility. One night I came home after a few drinks and used the downstairs loo but Niall had left the lid up once again. I nearly fell down the toilet when I sat down. My bum got wet. I got a real shock. It was very annoying. When I challenged him the next day, Niall just said he “forgot” and that it “wasn’t a big deal”. I think that’s inconsiderate. I work full-time and am six years older than Niall, so naturally I take on more of the responsibility in the house. I organise a cleaner. Things are generally tidy because of me. But when Niall leaves the toilet seat up I feel as if he’s making the bathroom look unclean. The downstairs bathroom is also the one that guests use. It’s embarrassing when they come over and I hear them slamming the seat against the loo. When they come out I’m like, “Sorry you had to touch the toilet. Niall left the lid up.” If I go into the bathroom and see the seat up I’ll say, “Niall, can you please move it?” He will look sheepish and claim that it’s an accident, but it happens every week. Niall will sometimes say I’m exerting my feminist politics over him when I ask him to put the lid down, but it’s not that – it’s just that when it’s not being used, it’s actually best to keep the toilet lid and seat down at all times. Niall once admitted that sitting down to pee is actually very comfortable but it’s not “the done thing”. But if he would pee sitting down then neither of us would worry about the seat being up. Toilet training a grown adult is not what I signed up for when we decided to live together, so if Niall can’t remember this then he will be banished from the downstairs bathroom for good. Leaving the seat up is fair enough. Why does Nuala insist we always have it down? I know this issue isn’t unique to me and my sister. The toilet seat debacle has bothered men and women for years. But men have never had an issue lifting the seat up – and we do it so we don’t pee on it, making it more hygienic for everyone. We are being considerate of others when we take this action. However, so many women seem to have an issue with us putting it down again. Why? It’s only fair that they do. If I leave the seat up, it really seems to annoy Nuala but really, it’s just not that deep. Sometimes I forget to put the toilet seat down and she will make a point of calling me into the bathroom and telling me off like a kid. But I genuinely forget; I don’t do it deliberately. Nuala will say I’m careless or inconsiderate and ask me to lower the seat in front of her. I have told her to chill out. She doesn’t like it when I say that. But I don’t want this to be a big thing. Once I left the toilet seat up and Nuala came back from a night out. She claims she nearly fell down it. I understand that it must have been irritating. Women have to sit on the toilet all the time so it can’t be pleasant to put your bum on a seat-less loo. But what can I say? It isn’t a regular occurrence and I did apologise. Nuala says I should try sitting down to pee so then neither of us needs to lift the seat up, but that’s just not normal. Like most men, I have got into the habit of peeing standing up. Nuala also says we should both leave the toilet lid and seat down at all times when we are not using it, which I guess is fair. However, it’s hard to retrain myself to always put it down. I only use the downstairs bathroom occasionally – before leaving home or if I’m in a rush. That bathroom is for everyone. I don’t think that I should be banned from using it just because I don’t adhere to Nuala’s standards. Should Niall put the toilet seat down? It is annoying to have to put the seat down, but it’s not a big issue and Nuala should relax – sharing space with others requires a bit of compromise. She has her own bathroom that she can keep exactly as she likes.Hannah, 35 Niall needs to be a bit more considerate of other people; putting down the toilet seat after use is common courtesy and not a big ask. Also, as a man who quite enjoys a sit-down wee, I’d say give it a try – you might be surprised.Jacob, 25 I’ve never understood the loo seat debacle – why is it more unhygienic for Nuala to touch it than it is for Niall? Nuala sounds like a controlling big sister and should be more tolerant (but Niall, never tell a woman to “chill”!)Cath, 53 Nuala claims her issue is hygiene, but her real issue seems to be one of control. She plays the martyr for having to “toilet train” her brother but comes across as a Nurse Ratched figure. The most hygienic solution would be for each person to adjust the toilet at the beginning of their bathroom breaks; not return the toilet to one person’s ideal pre-pee state after each use, no matter what.Ben, 29 Niall is guilty – he should make an effort to get into the habit of putting the seat down. However, Nuala isn’t going to change things by chiding him. Put a sticky note on the door with a cryptic message to remind him, and stop bringing the issue up with guests.Natalie, 26 So now you can be the judge, click on the poll below to tell us: should Niall stop leaving the toilet seat up?

4/1/2022,"To quote Nora Ephron in her take-down of Dorothy Schiff, I feel bad about what I’m going to do here. It’s not a take-down, but still, I feel bad. I am probably in the wrong. I’m being all the things one is accused of in these instances, in good faith and bad: chippy, oversensitive, territorial, ungenerous and, as my mother would have said, looking for nonsense. I have tried to frame the following less as opinion than reporting. I am, merely, passing on a conversation presently taking place among lesbians who watch a lot of prestige TV and tend to notice who wrote it. But I can only maintain the delusion so far. At some point, neutrality gives way to something else. It’s about Sally Wainwright – sort of – who of course, we all love. We love Wainwright because we love Sarah Lancashire and Suranne Jones, her two leading ladies. There isn’t a lesbian in Britain who isn’t in love with Suranne Jones. I have no opinion about this, I am simply reporting the facts. The same goes for Sarah Lancashire. Wainwright is justifiably one of the most beloved creators of TV in Britain. Last week, she was to be found in this paper promoting season two of Gentleman Jack, her BBC/HBO show about Anne Lister, the landowner who rocked around Yorkshire in the mid-19th century, enthusiastically seducing women. Lister has been styled, by HBO and others, as the “first modern lesbian”. Most of us agree that, as a broad principle, anyone can write about anything they like, and Wainwright has written a lot about lesbians; in Last Tango in Halifax, in At Home With the Braithwaites, and now in Gentleman Jack. Lesbianism is a useful plot point, like murder, or infidelity and historically has tended to be treated in one of three ways on screen: with lurid disdain, with lascivious voyeurism – think Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct – or with dreary, agonised despair. Lesbians are, generally, so grateful not to be depicted as weirdos, murderers, or sexless creatures in bonnets picking up stones off a beach, that when a halfway decent writer comes along and gives them attention, they – we – are quite forgiving if the details are off. Better a sympathetic straight woman than Jed Mercurio. I’m making a wild assumption here. Wainwright, who until they separated was married for 29 years to a man with whom she has two adult children, could conceivably identify as queer. But anyway, her lived experience, shall we say, is not that of a woman married to a woman in a starkly homophobic society. In the Guardian last week she said of Gentleman Jack that it was a story, “so life-affirming, uplifting and clever. She didn’t die at the end – she got her big romantic reconciliation. That’s what gay women responded to”. She put this in contrast to Last Tango in Halifax, a great show with a central storyline about lesbians in which Kate, one half of a gay couple, goes under a car. “I got slated for that,” said Wainwright. “Apparently, all lesbians die in telly, which I just didn’t know.” Ha; yeah; it’s almost as if you don’t know much about the experiences of the people you’re writing about. See? We’re chippy. It comes from decades of shitty representation, or no representation at all. And by the standards of what came before, Wainwright’s treatment of lesbians is of course nuanced and sympathetic. And so here I am, wringing my hands. Why am I being mean about this nice straight lady writing gentle plot lines that, OK, in some places bear absolutely no relation whatsoever to experiences an actual gay person has had – in Last Tango, Kate shags her ex-boyfriend to conceive a baby she wants to raise with her girlfriend, while the girlfriend sits uncomplainingly downstairs. Have you ever sat next to a lesbian? We complain. A lot. About everything. That woman is not sitting there in a hotel bar while her girlfriend has sex in the room with a guy. If she’s not storming upstairs to create a scene, at the very least she has a drink problem. Some of the irritation here is just market economics. Women’s stories take up less space than men’s; lesbian stories a tiny portion within that. Production companies will routinely say they have their “one gay” story of the season and it will inevitably be about gay men. It is easier to be a gay man than a lesbian because it is easier to be a man than a woman. Just look at Ryan Murphy, swaggering around Hollywood promoting great stories about gay men. Where is his female counterpart? (I’ll tell you where she is, she’s in the closet.) I’m aware that none of this leads anywhere good. The appropriation debate only ends in gridlock. If a writer is vetoed on the basis of who they are, what about an actor? Sarah Silverman raised this issue last year when she called out non-Jewish actors for effectively donning “Jewface”, pointing in particular to the non-Jewish actor who plays Mrs Maisel, and the propriety of Felicity Jones being cast as Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Nuances might be missed, but in my view this isn’t about performance. With a good enough writer or actor the differences can be largely surmounted. It’s not even about employment opportunity, although there is that. It’s a largely emotional response, a request for basic acknowledgment. If you belong to a minority that has, historically, been blocked from proportionate access to the market, it sits really badly to watch someone from a category of greater privilege use your stories for their own advancement. Bitter! Did I mention we’re also quite bitter? And here’s the worst part. The defence often used by straight people writing about gay people is that they, too, have felt estrangement in their lives and so understand the terrain. This extends beyond writing to less tangible areas. Here’s Tilda Swinton, identifying as queer “not in terms of my sexual life,” as she told the Guardian this year, but because as a young person she was “just odd”. I’ve seen similar comments by other artists, referring to a disconnect they represent in their fiction as gayness. Guess what? We don’t entirely love that! Gayness is not a catch-all category for people struggling with feelings of rejection. No one wants to be used metaphorically. No one wants to be a proxy for someone else’s social unease. People tend to be wedded to the specificities of their own experience, particularly when it comes to representation. Common cause is wonderful and with any luck, in 20 years, none of this will matter. But it matters now. And so here we are. I loved Happy Valley. I loved huge chunks of Last Tango. I feel abject and unhappy raising all this. But as a friend – a massive dyke, let’s be clear, not someone with a nebulous sense of generalised anxiety looking for a convenient peg to hang it on – said to me the other day on the subject of Swinton, Wainwright, and some of the others gently congratulating themselves for claiming affinity with an experience to which they bring good intentions but no particular insight: “What the fuck does any of this have to do with us?” Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,Why does it make me uneasy when straight women write TV about lesbians? | Emma Brockes,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/01/straight-women-tv-shows-lesbians-sally-wainwright
4/1/2022,"Hundreds of environmental protesters have blocked seven oil terminals across the country as part of a campaign to paralyse the UK’s fossil fuel infrastructure. Early on Friday, supporters of Just Stop Oil began blockades at oil refineries around London, Birmingham and Southampton, by climbing on top of tankers and gluing themselves to road surfaces Shortly after 4am, activists blocked terminals in Purfleet and Grays, Essex, which they said were the biggest in the country. In Tamworth, near Birmingham, a group of more than two dozen protesters had been hoping to disrupt the nearby Kingsbury oil terminal. However, due to police intervention they were able only to block a road leading to the site. Just Stop Oil has demanded that the government agree to halt all new licences for fossil fuel projects in the UK. They have vowed to continue disrupting the UK’s oil infrastructure until the government agrees. Louis McKecknie, 21 from Weymouth, who last month zip-tied his neck to a goalpost at Goodison Park, Everton football club’s ground, as part of the campaign, said: “I don’t want to be doing this but our genocidal government gives me no choice. “They know that oil is funding Putin’s war and pushing millions of people into fuel poverty while energy companies reap billions in profits. They know that to allow more oil and gas extraction in the UK is suicidal and will accelerate global heating. It means millions dying of heat stress, losing their homes or having to fight for food. This is the future for my generation, I stop when oil stops.” The action is part of a planned series of protests against UK oil infrastructure. Extinction Rebellion, which is to begin its next wave of protest on 9 April, has said it supported the Just Stop Oil campaign and had mobilised its activists to join. Just Stop Oil has said its campaign marks a shift from civil disobedience and into civil resistance. What this means, one supporter told the Guardian last month, “is stopping pointing out what the government should or shouldn’t be doing [and instead] actively stopping government doing what they shouldn’t be.” In Tamworth, the group of activists had gathered in a nearby McDonald’s before making their way to the site, but were initially deterred from acting by a police helicopter. One activist said that scouts had seen large numbers of police in unmarked cars near the site. They feared that if they got into vehicles for the last leg of their intended journey they would be pulled over and arrested, but hoped they could find a way through. Eventually, the group split up and most made their way to Kingsbury on foot. “It’s us against the state,” said one protester. “And we’re going to lose, but we have to try something.”",News/Environment,Environmental protesters block oil terminals across England,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/01/environmental-protesters-block-oil-terminals-across-england
4/1/2022,"Patrick Demarchelier, the fashion photographer who worked with high-profile figures including Diana, Princess of Wales, has died at the age of 78. His death was announced by his representatives on Instagram on Thursday. “It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Patrick Demarchelier on March 31st 2022, at the age of 78,” the post read. “He is survived by his wife Mia, his three sons Gustaf, Arthur, Victor and three grandchildren.” Demarchelier produced the cover for the front cover of the 1991 December issue of Vogue, which featured Diana. He worked for a multitude of other top magazines including Harper’s Bazaar, Elle and Rolling Stone, as well as many high-end fashion brands. He helped shoot advertisement campaigns for Dior, Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Tommy Hilfiger and Carolina Herrera. During his extensive career, Demarchelier photographed a string of high-profile celebrities including Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, and Madonna. But in 2018, seven women models accused the photographer of sexual assault, allegations Demarchelier denied, branding the accusations as “ridiculous”. In response to the allegations, publisher Condé Nast stopped working with him. He was mentioned in the 2006 film Devil Wears Prada film, when he is sought after by the fashion juggernaut Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep. Among those paying tribute to Demarchelier were the US designer Vera Wang, and models including Bella Hadid, Cindy Crawford and Hailey Bieber. Wang said she was “saddened to the core” by the news and would “always treasure” Demarchelier’s talent and kindness. Sharing a picture of one of their final shoots together, she wrote: “We began our fashion journey together on a SHOPHOUND shoot for American Vogue where he met his wife Mia. I will always treasure his talent, his kindness and our long history. So many sittings for Vogue, then ad campaigns for Vera Wang, the company. “I am saddened to the core. To his wife and family, I send my love. May he rest in peace forever more.” The celebrity hair stylist Sam McKnight, who also worked with Diana, said he had “so much” to thank Demarchelier for. “Oh I am so sad to hear this,” he replied to the original post. “I had the best times with Patrick, endless incredible iconic photos, wonderful memories, a lifetime of laughter, I have so much to thank him for, there will never be another.” Posting on Instagram, he added: “Oh, dear Patrick, how you made us laugh. Thank you for having me around for the beautiful ride. Rest in peace my friend.” The codel Bella Hadid said: ”I am grateful to have been lucky enough to be in front of your lens. Most gentle, most legendary, soft but full of life. You will be missed Patrick. Rest in peace. I will miss this day, and you dear Patrick.” Sharing pictures of herself taken by Demarchelier, Cindy Crawford said: “Rest in peace, @patrickdemarchelier. Thanks for so many great memories and beautiful, timeless images.” The actor Kate Hudson said she had always enjoyed working with the photographer and sent a “ton of love” to his family. “So many memories. I had the pleasure of being photographed by Patrick often and always enjoyed him and his team so much,” she wrote.",Lifestyle/Fashion,French fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier dies at 78,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/01/french-fashion-photographer-patrick-demarchelier-dies-at-78
4/1/2022,"Scientists have created a moving magnetic slime capable of encircling smaller objects, self-healing and “very large deformation” to squeeze and travel through narrow spaces. The slime, which is controlled by magnets, is also a good electrical conductor and can be used to interconnect electrodes, its creators say. The dark-coloured magnetic blob has been compared on social media to Flubber, the eponymous substance in the 1997 sci-fi film, and described as a “magnetic turd” and “amazing and a tiny bit terrifying”. Prof Li Zhang, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who co-created the slime, emphasised that the substance was real scientific research and not an April fool’s joke, despite the timing of its release. The slime contains magnetic particles so that it can be manipulated to travel, rotate, or form O and C shapes when external magnets are applied to it. The blob was described in a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Advanced Functional Materials as a “magnetic slime robot”. “The ultimate goal is to deploy it like a robot,” Zhang said, adding that for the time being the slime lacked autonomy. “We still consider it as fundamental research – trying to understand its material properties.” A robot made of magnetic slime could be deployed inside the body to perform tasks such as retrieving objects swallowed by accident.https://t.co/EYpnx56vNO pic.twitter.com/zA3hMO80xQ The slime has “visco-elastic properties”, Zhang said, meaning that “sometimes it behaves like a solid, sometimes it behaves like a liquid”. It is made of a mixture of a polymer called polyvinyl alcohol, borax – which is widely used in cleaning products – and particles of neodymium magnet. “It’s very much like mixing water with [corn] starch at home,” Zhang said. Mixing the two produces oobleck, a non-Newtonian fluid whose viscosity changes under force. “When you touch it very quickly it behaves like a solid. When you touch it gently and slowly it behaves like a liquid,” Zhang said. While the team have no immediate plans to test it in a medical setting, the scientists envisage the slime could be useful in the digestive system, for example in reducing the harm from a small swallowed battery. “To avoid toxic electrolytes leak[ing] out, we can maybe use this kind of slime robot to do an encapsulation, to form some kind of inert coating,” he said. The magnetic particles in the slime, however, are toxic themselves. The researchers coated the slime in a layer of silica – the main component in sand – to form a hypothetically protective layer. “The safety [would] also strongly depend on how long you would keep them inside of your body,” Zhang said. Zhang added that pigments or dye could be used to make the slime – which is currently an opaque brown-black hue – more colourful.",News/Science,‘Magnetic turd’: scientists invent moving slime that could be used in human digestive systems,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/01/magnetic-turd-scientists-invent-moving-slime-that-could-be-used-in-human-digestive-systems
4/1/2022,"H&M has signed a legally binding agreement with one of its largest Indian clothing suppliers that pledges to end sexual violence and harassment against women on the factory floor after the murder of a young garment worker by her supervisor last year. In January 2021, Jeyasre Kathiravel, a 20-year-old Dalit woman, was found dead on farmland near her family home after finishing a shift at Natchi Apparel, a factory making clothes for H&M in Kaithian Kottai, Tamil Nadu. Her supervisor reportedly confessed to her murder and is awaiting trial. Her family also allege that she was raped before she was killed, and had suffered sexual harassment and intimidation at work in the months before her death, but felt powerless to prevent the abuse. An independent investigation last year by the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), which has not yet been made public, heard testimony from other female workers of widespread gender-based violence at Natchi Apparel, and H&M and Eastman Exports then began talks with the Tamil Nadu Textile and Common Labour Union (TTCU), as well as regional and international labour rights groups. The legally binding agreement that resulted is only the second of its kind in the fashion industry, and the first time a brand has ever signed up to an initiative to tackle gender-based violence in Asia’s garment industry, where a workforce of mostly poor women make millions of tons of clothing for UK high streets every year. Under the terms of the agreement, all workers, supervisors and executives will have to undergo gender-based violence training and the TTCU will recruit and train female workers as “shopfloor monitors” who will ensure women are protected from verbal harassment and sexual intimidation. The agreement also overhauls Natchi’s internal complaints committees, a mechanism required under Indian law in all workplaces but which has failed for decades to protect women from male violence at the Natchi factories. Women will now be able to report sexual harassment anonymously to an independent panel that will have the power to dismiss perpetrators and seek financial compensation for victims and their families. Subhash Tiwari, director at Eastman Exports, said: “It is our top priority to make sure that women on our shopfloors are safe and to do that women must be able to be seen and heard and feel empowered to report if something goes wrong. “We will not allow any kind of infraction of the terms of this agreement. This is not just zero tolerance, what we want is a complete elimination of harassment and all forms of violence against our female employees.” Thivya Rakini, state president of the TTCU, said the agreement was a victory for women in the workplace. “We believe this has the power to change things and has meant that something good has come from the terrible tragedy of Jeyasre’s death. This has shown the power of a Dalit woman workforce to seek justice and we look forward to working with factory management.” The Asia Floor Wage Alliance (AFWA) and the international labour rights group Global Labor Justice-International Labor Rights Forum (GLJ-ILRF), also co-signatories to the agreement, said that this should be seen as a moment of change for the fashion industry. Anannya Bhattacharjee, international coordinator at AFWA, said: “We are confident that this agreement can be a model for change across the global garment industry, where gender-based violence is endemic and still largely disregarded and ignored.” Jennifer Rosenbaum, of the GLJ-ILRF, said: “This enforceable agreement is a model for how to bring about real change with collaboration among brands, suppliers, unions and global labour partners.” In a statement, H&M said Jeyasre Kathiravel’s death was a tragedy, and the company’s thoughts were with her family. “H&M Group wants to do our utmost to contribute to systemic and positive change in the industry and have therefore signed an agreement to work together with industry stakeholders to address, prevent and remedy gender-based violence and sexual harassment,” a spokesperson said. “We expect this agreement to contribute to a broader industry-wide initiative going forward.” In 2019, the US brands Levi Strauss, Wrangler Jeans and The Children’s Place signed the Lesotho Agreement, the first industry accord to tackle gender-based violence after a WRC investigation that uncovered the systematic sexual assault of more than 120 women at three jeans factories in Lesotho.",News/Global development,H&M pledges to end shopfloor sexual violence in India after worker killed ,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/01/hm-pledges-to-end-shopfloor-sexual-violence-in-india-after-worker-killed-jeyasre-kathiravel
4/1/2022,"Homelessness services will be nearly $40m worse off under the federal budget and may have to shed hundreds of jobs, as new modelling shows the government’s cost of living measures will disproportionately benefit higher-income earners. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced on Tuesday that the budget would include $8.6bn in one-off cash payments and temporary changes to petrol and income taxes to help ease the rapidly rising cost of living. But modelling from the Australian National University has revealed that 56% of the dollar value from the measures would go to middle and higher income earners, most of it coming from the one-off $420 tax offset, the largest of the Coalition government’s three major cost of living measures, valued at $4.1bn. Households with the highest amount of financial stress – those in the lowest 20% when ranked by income – received only 15% of the financial gains from the measures. In his speech on Tuesday, Frydenberg said the Morrison government was tackling “higher fuel, food and shipping costs” with a “temporary, targeted and responsible cost of living package”. Associate Prof Ben Phillips from ANU’s Centre for Social Research and Methods, who performed the analysis, said the income tax offset, which applies to those earning up to $126k per annum, “probably wasn’t really needed”. “Financial stressors in Australia are much more focused on low and middle income families [who have a lower taxable income],” Phillips said. The median income in Australia is $62,400 per annum, with those earning over $100k in the top 20% of earners in the country. “Savings rates have increased quite substantially among middle and higher income households, and retail spending has been very strong recently too,” said Phillips. “That suggests higher income families probably aren’t struggling very much. They don’t need tax cuts. The cuts may also put additional pressure on the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates.” Phillips’ analysis also found the impact of the fuel excise reduction was lower for households than was stated in the budget papers, which estimated the impact on both households and business combined. The $250 one-off cash payment to people on low incomes, worth an estimated $1.5bn, failed to address systemic issues with the rate of welfare payments, Phillips said. “$250 is nice but not much in the scheme of things. For people on welfare payments, the problem is not just about the fact that petrol prices have grown sharply in the last few months; I’d be more concerned about the long-term problem, which is simply that they don’t receive enough money on a weekly basis, regardless of what happens with inflation.” At the same time, the budget failed to renew supplementary funding to homelessness services designed to address the historic underpayment of the largely female workforce in the social services sector. The $39.4m shortfall from July 2023 marks the end of a decade of supplementary federal support for homelessness services as part of a 2012 equal remuneration order (ERO) made by the Fair Work Commission to increase wages in the community services sector. The ERO meant wages for those working for homelessness services increased, but the sector has expressed fears that without that funding continuing as a matter of course, they will need to either reduce vital services or shed employees, leaving vulnerable Australians with even less support. Jenny Smith from Homelessness Australia told Guardian Australia that unless it was made up by extra contributions from the states, the federal funding gap would mean between 400 and 560 jobs would probably be lost from the sector after July next year. “Homelessness services provide crisis responses, support to people trying to find a permanent home, and they provide support for people with serious mental illness,” Smith said. “This affects every homelessness service provider in the country, funded by a state or territory government. It’s breathtaking, really. That’s fewer people to answer the door, and taking support away from people who are relying on it.” Along with the funding reinstatement, Homelessness Australia is calling for an increase in federal investment in social housing and for jobseeker to return permanently to the increased rate it was at the start of the early pandemic lockdown period. “We’re already turning away 250 people a day without giving people what they need. That was before Covid. It’s even worse now,” Smith said. “But there is no policy or plan from this federal government to do anything about it. And now it’s kicked our organisations in the guts.”",News/Australia news,Budget favours higher earners as homelessness services slashed by nearly $40m,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/budget-favours-higher-earners-as-homelessness-services-slashed-by-nearly-40m
4/1/2022,"The award-winning story Arrival, which opens Gurnaik Johal’s virtuosic debut collection, exemplifies his deceptively simple style. A young couple live near the airport, and a car has been left on their driveway by the sister of a friend. The car’s presence – its practicality and luxury – changes the couple’s relationship. Both humans and objects often appear or disappear in Johal’s stories, altering the destinies and dynamics of the protagonists’ lives. These loosely linked stories are mostly set in Southall, west London, among a close-knit British-Punjabi community, with multiple perspectives introduced that shed light on recurring scenes. Characters reappear across stories to create new beginnings and to change endings and readers’ expectations. Johal writes about relationships with the assuredness of Akhil Sharma, as untranslated Hindi, Punjabi and Marathi words and idioms sit confidently on the page. Leave to Remain is less about crossing political borders and more about traversing personal thresholds. The Red River is less about assimilation and more about finding a room of one’s own. Strange Attractor and Haven Green explore such elusive concepts as serendipity and destiny. In the fourth story, Chatpata: Kaam, Jagmeet remembers reading an interview with his chef daughter, Aman, about her restaurant in Brooklyn, which is called Ambrosia. In the interview, she talks about what it means to make comforting “chatpata” food – that balanced mixture of spiciness, sourness and sweetness central to many Indian cuisines. Aman is still coming to terms with people saying that her food – indeed, all her “Indian identity” – is “too much”. She desperately wants to overcome westerners’ “mango-fetish” (“You only had to wait so long when reading a western story about India to come across a mango, a railway or a spiritual awakening”). As a collection, We Move similarly challenges cultural stereotypes and expectations through its understated and surprising stories. This, the first of a trio of connected “chatpata” stories, features a family grieving the loss of a mother in various ways: through spirituality, and through sharing secrets and recipes. Other stories feature death (Flight Path, The Piano) and disappearance (Arrival, Be More Roy), but Johal is more interested in greyer areas of mortality and legacy, in the meaning of a life lived and shared. The writing has an air of soft melancholy, but it never veers into sentimentality or melodrama. Throughout, the stories are seldom as they first appear: the light is always shifting. Johal works in the shadows and the crevices; his strength is that these stylistic techniques and narrative choices are applied with a delicate touch. He could have written a bloated intergenerational saga, but he knows the value of withdrawing, holding out, providing just enough to keep the scene or story going. His stories – one only two pages long – are not dissimilar to the deconstructed pakoras Aman serves at Ambrosia, complete with Coke-flavoured, charcoal-coloured foam: bite-size offerings, but rich with complexity, history, and the memory of a childhood meal full of flavour and fizz. In the same interview, Aman says that her aim is to “hold both the future and the past on the plate”. With We Move, Johal has arguably overcome fetishes of the past – that sense of “too muchness” – but he also brings fresh ingredients to the future of Indian writing from the diaspora. With a gentle stir, situations change before our eyes, or perhaps it’s our perspective that changes. Everything tastes spicy and sour and sweet all at once.
