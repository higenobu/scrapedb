2/4/2022,"Universities and accommodation providers need to tackle the racism experienced by Black students in halls of residence, according to a report that found claims of “racially segregated” accommodation and widespread abuse from other students. More than half of Black students surveyed in the report said they had been victims of racism while living in UK student accommodation, and nearly two-thirds had witnessed racism. “These experiences ranged from insensitivity around things like hair or food, to the use of racial slurs, to spitting, shouting and physical violence,” the report, Living Black at University, said.  More than 1,000 students were surveyed and interviews were carried out for the research, commissioned by the student accommodation provider Unite Students, which is the first to deal with the experience of racism in higher education in a non-academic context. Several students interviewed said they suspected there was an intentional policy by their universities to segregate students by race or nationality, with one saying: “My block was known as the block for Black people from London. I think it was probably intentional because there was also a block with mainly white students.” Three-quarters of Black students reported an impact on their mental health due to racism, compounded by a lack of support and difficulties in finding Black counsellors who had the experience to understand the impact. The report concludes that universities and accommodation providers should act together “to eliminate racism from all areas of the student experience, including student accommodation”, including training for staff, and by ensuring that staff reflect the diversity of the students. The report also calls for accommodation providers to “build a relationship of trust with Black students” and to collect and publish data and outcomes of complaints involving racism. Prof Iyiola Solanke, the dean for equality, diversity and inclusion at the University of Leeds, told a seminar on the report hosted by the Higher Education Policy Institute that she was surprised that many of the instances of racism hadn’t changed from when she was an undergraduate, when other students expected her to be a drug dealer or to like hip-hop. Solanke said there was a “direct pipeline” between tackling racism in university housing and increasing the number of Black professors. “I think Black students have shown that they are adventurous, they’re willing to go to campuses that are not well integrated … but universities need to reciprocate and really need to do what they can to encourage students to stay, because that’s also a way to diversify faculty and diversify professional services,” Solanke said. Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, the vice-president for higher education at the National Union of Students, said: “For a long time, the experiences of students in student accommodation have been overlooked and disconnected from the broader university experience. This is particularly true for Black students, who often speak of high levels of racism in and at university, including in their accommodation.” The study did reveal some positive findings in terms of students and staff members tackling instances of racism: 40% of Black respondents said they had seen staff “positively confront racist attitudes”, while 57% said they had witnessed other students confronting racist attitudes. David Richardson, the vice-chancellor of the University of East Anglia and chair of the Universities UK advisory group on racial harassment, said: “It is deeply worrying to see the proportion of students who report being a victim of racism in their accommodation. It’s another reminder that we must keep collectively working on tackling racism throughout higher education.”",News/Education,Report condemns racism in UK’s ‘racially segregated’ student housing,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/03/report-condemns-racism-in-uks-racially-segregated-student-housing
2/4/2022,"The government has been reported as saying that, after the police inquiry, there will be publication of the full report by Sue Gray. In fact, an “update” has been promised in the light of the police inquiry (Report, 31 January). An update may or may not be the “full” report. But the scope of publication of the Scott inquiry report is a precedent which may help Sue Gray.  The Scott inquiry report in 1996 (re whether licensing by the UK government of defence exports to Iraq was in contravention of the government’s policy) examined the conduct of two prime ministers, several cabinet and junior ministers, and civil servants. The report was published in full, save for exclusion of a small segment concerning a sensitive intelligence matter. There were also limited redactions for overriding national security reasons. Such transparency was the only way in which the public could have confidence in Sir Richard Scott’s conclusions, not least in view of criticisms that ministers had deliberately withheld relevant information about Iraq-related defence exports in answer to questions from parliamentarians and had wrongfully withheld information in court proceedings at the Old Bailey. Specifically, what did full publication entail? The judge published (a) the extensive written questionnaires sent to witnesses and their responses; (b) the source documents to which express reference was made in the report; and (c) the documents and submissions made by government departments and the intelligence agencies in response to the inquiry’s general questions. The oral hearings had largely been in open session and so transcripts had already been published. The question of full publication must, of course, be treated on its own merits. For example, if civil service staff were involved in misconduct short of criminality which might result in disciplinary proceedings against them, fairness might require a degree of anonymisation pending the outcome of such proceedings. This approach has been previously adopted in Whitehall. Subject to that, full publication in line with the Scott inquiry precedent is the right thing to do in the national interest.Christopher MuttukumaruBromley, London",News/Politics,Sue Gray should look to the Scott inquiry as an example of transparency | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/sue-gray-should-look-to-the-scott-inquiry-as-an-example-of-transparency
2/4/2022,"The mighty United States women’s hockey team launched their first Olympic title defense in two decades with an air of menace on Thursday night, roaring to a 5-2 win in the opening game of pool play against a Finland team expected to contend for a medal. But the Americans’ hopes of becoming the first team to win back-to-back Olympic gold medals were dealt a devastating blow early on when assistant captain Brianna Decker suffered a leg injury that will sideline her for the duration of the tournament.  Decker, a three-time Olympian and steady veteran presence who has scored 170 points in 146 appearances with the national team, became trapped beneath Finland defender Ronja Savolainen midway through the opening period and the game still scoreless. The 31-year-old forward’s screams resounded through the nearly empty arena in a horrifying scene until she was stretchered off the ice by medical staff. “It was sickening,” USA forward Amanda Kessel said afterward. “She is one of the toughest players I have ever played with. She is not staying down on the ice and not crying if it was not bad.” She added: “We want to win for her.” Kessel wasted no time after play resumed, tucking in the opening goal for Team USA less than two minutes later on an assist from Savannah Harmon. The Americans doubled the margin shortly after when Alex Carpenter beat the goaltender upstairs on a power play, making Finland pay for a Petra Nieminen hooking penalty. The US took the game by the scruff after the first intermission, firing shots on goal with greater frequency until USA captain Kendall Coyne Schofield broke through twice in a 64-second span to bust things open. The Americans outshot their opponents 19-2 in the middle period and 52-12 overall. Finland pulled one back on a power play early in the third, but Carpenter responded with her second goal of the night moments later, tapping the puck across the line off a pass from Abby Roque, who moved up into Decker’s spot on the second line. Susanna Tapani’s cosmetic goal for the Finns off the post in the dying minutes made for a scoreline that didn’t quite reflect the one-way traffic of the affair. The fewer than 200 spectators invited by organizers to attend, all masked and distanced on one side of the 15,384-seat Wukesong Sports Centre, politely clapped and waved flags for all seven goals. Cheering was prohibited as a precaution against spreading the coronavirus. “It was good to get that first one under our belt,” said Carpenter, a 2014 Olympic silver medalist who is back in the national team after she was surprisingly dropped ahead of the gold medal run four years ago. “That was a really good game for us to start. Finland always gives us a great game, so I think for us to come out and put up those goals, it’s a good confidence boost for our ream moving forward.” The women’s ice hockey tournament, which kicked off Thursday with four preliminary round games, is once again expected to come down to the USA and Canada, who delivered their own statement of intent earlier Thursday with a 12-1 win over Switzerland. The two countries have met in the final at the last three Winter Olympics and have dominated the world championship since its inception in 1990. Four years ago in South Korea, the Americans saw off Canada in a penalty shootout in the final to deny their northern neighbors a fifth straight Olympic gold. But Canada hit back at the most recent world championships in August when Marie-Philip Poulin scored an overtime winner to end Team USA’s bid for a sixth straight title. Finland, who captured the bronze medal in Pyeongchang, have been widely tipped as the likeliest outsider to upset the sport’s North American hegemony. Led by captain Jenni Hiirikoski, who was named the best defenseman at the past two Olympics, they are a well organized, defensively minded side with depth at every position. But their ninth loss from nine all-time meetings with Team USA in Olympic play, none closer than two goals, showed just how far they have to go. “USA started to skate a little more than we did and that is what showed on the scoreboard,” Finland defenseman Minnamari Tuominen said. “Obviously there’s room for improvement but I think that we worked hard and tried to execute what we talked about.”",Sport/Sport,‘It was sickening’: USA women’s hockey team lose star Decker in Olympic opener,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/03/brianna-decker-injury-team-usa-hockey-winter-olympics-finland
2/4/2022,"Millions of UK households are expected to be dragged into fuel poverty for the first time despite the support announced by Rishi Sunak to soften the blow from soaring energy bills. Several charities warned that the chancellor his plan was badly targeted and offered too little support for those most in need. The scale of the shock to low-income households would drive hunger, rent arrears, and ill health, and pile extra demand on to already stretched food banks and homeless shelters, they said.  The Resolution Foundation thinktank said cases of fuel stress – where energy bills in a household exceed 10% of disposable income – would double to 5 million in April despite the steps announced by Sunak on Thursday. The Treasury’s intervention was designed to ease the pressure of a £700 increase in the regulated energy price cap to nearly £2,000 a year. Without the chancellor’s plan – which offers most consumers £350 of relief on their bills – fuel stress would have trebled to more than 6 million, the thintank said. However, it criticised’s Sunak’s decision to favour a moderate amount of help for a large number of people, rather than deeper support for those most in need. “The government’s package of measures might cushion the blow for some but it’s not enough to protect people who already need a food bank,” said Garry Lemon, the policy director at the Trussell Trust food bank network. He called for the planned 3.1% rise in benefits from April to be doubled to 7%. Almost all families in the poorest tenth of households in Britain face spending more than 10% of their disposable income on heating and electricity bills, according to the IPPR thinktankMeanwhile, it estimates 44% of those in Britain with the highest household incomes – the top 10% – would in effect get a tax cut from Sunak’s measures. Dame Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Even before these price hikes kick in, we’re seeing record numbers of people needing crisis support like food vouchers … If the government is serious about helping families facing the desperate choice between heating and eating it should use the benefits system.” Pressure on incomes will build over the coming months after the Bank of England increased interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5%, in a development designed to tackle soaring inflationary pressures but probably to drive up household costs in the short-term. The Bank’s economists are forecasting inflation will peak at 7.25% in April, up from 5.4% at present. Along with the rising cost of a weekly shop, British households will also face higher borrowing costs on mortgages and credit cards. The government also plans an increase in national insurance contributions in April – the same month as the energy price rise. Tony Syme, a macroeconomics expert at the University of Salford Business School, said: “The increase in interest rates will have minimal effect on inflation and will only exacerbate the cost of living crisis. Higher housing costs will be passed onto homeowners through increased mortgage rates and on to renters as landlords pass on their increased costs of borrowing.” “These energy crisis measures are woefully inadequate and will leave those on the lowest incomes and in the least efficient homes in deep peril,” said Adam Scorer, the chief executive of charity National Energy Action. “We needed deep, targeted support for the most vulnerable. We have shallow, broad measures for all. That simply does not work.” Although the chancellor announced a £150m hardship grant for English councils to help struggling families, critics said the dismantling of the local welfare system over the past decade meant many authorities lacked the resources and expertise to deliver meaningful crisis support. “Budget cuts mean 32 English councils have closed their crisis schemes leaving 13 million people in England without this support. These local authorities no longer have the infrastructure or processes in place to direct additional government funding to those most in need of help,” said Claire Donovan, of End Furniture Poverty.",News/Business,"Millions in UK face fuel poverty despite Sunak support, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/millions-uk-fuel-poverty-sunak-support-rising-energy-bills-low-income-households
2/4/2022,"Piers Morgan “must have had knowledge of voicemail interception” and other unlawful information gathering techniques when he was editor of the Daily Mirror, it has been claimed at the high court. Lawyers acting for alleged phone hacking victims made the accusation while seeking financial records relating to Morgan’s time in charge of the newspaper in the early 2000s.  They claim illegal techniques were used by individuals working for the Mirror during Morgan’s time as editor, including in relation to a story exposing Jeremy Clarkson for having an affair. Morgan recently signed an enormous contract with Rupert Murdoch’s media empire worth tens of millions of pounds to be the face of the forthcoming talkTV channel. He has always strongly denied any knowledge of phone hacking at the Mirror and previously told the Guardian: “I’ve never hacked a phone nor told anybody to hack a phone.” Yet the high court filings allege that, during Morgan’s time as editor, a Daily Mirror reporter had “been carrying out VMI [voicemail interception] on Mr Clarkson and trawling his phone bill” with the help of a private detective agency. The lawyers allege this information was then used to help paparazzi photographers capture pictures of Clarkson with a woman who was not his wife, which were then published by Morgan in the Mirror. In legal filings, they insist that it was inconceivable that Morgan would not have known how the story about a prominent celebrity had been obtained. One of their key sources is the Insider, Morgan’s own book about his time as Mirror editor: “Mr Morgan admitted in the Insider that he approached Mr Clarkson and must have known the origins of the story and the details of the UIG [unlawful intelligence gathering] before he did so.” The court filings also state that Southern Investigations, a private detective agency run by former police officers which was entwined in the case of the murder of Daniel Morgan, helped the Mirror with the Clarkson story. While Morgan was editor the private investigators issued an invoice for help contacting “confidential sources” for information on Clarkson. In order to prove the accusations, the lawyers are seeking disclosure of what payments to private investigators, if any, were signed off by Morgan and Neil Wallis, the editor of sister title the Sunday People. Although it is more than 15 years since the start of the phone hacking scandal, which led to the closure of Rupert Murdoch’s News of the World, cases continue to make their way through the court system. Dozens of individuals, including the Duke of Sussex, are still filing new claims. Murdoch’s News UK and Reach, the publisher of the Mirror, have collectively paid out hundreds of millions of pounds in damages and costs since 2006.",News/Media,"Piers Morgan ‘must have known’ about Daily Mirror phone hacking, say lawyers",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/03/piers-morgan-must-have-known-about-daily-mirror-phone-hacking-say-lawyers
2/4/2022,"Russia is to expel the German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW) in retaliation for a German ban on broadcasts by Russia’s RT. The foreign ministry said the press credentials of DW’s correspondents would be revoked, its bureau in Russia closed, and its German-language broadcasts would be banned from Russian satellite television in the near future. It said this was the first stage of its “retaliatory measures”.  The move marks an escalation in Russia’s media war with the west, in which there have already been expulsions of a BBC journalist and a Dutch reporter in the last year. It comes during a period of heightened geopolitical tensions as western governments have accused Russia of preparing to launch an attack on Ukraine and threatened crippling sanctions. On Wednesday German authorities banned broadcasts by RT DE, the broadcaster’s German-language channel, saying its Serbian licence was invalid in Germany. A Kremlin spokesperson called the decision political and said it was “nothing but an attack on freedom of expression”. Russia has said it will retaliate against journalists when foreign governments target RT, a state-funded news agency that western governments have accused of spreading propaganda. Ultimately, the foreign ministry went beyond a tit-for-tat decision to ban DW’s broadcasts, in effect blocking the broadcaster’s ability to report on the ground in Russia. RT DE journalists were not stripped of their accreditation as part of the German government decision. The Russian foreign ministry also said it would initiate a procedure to recognise Deutsche Welle as a “foreign agent” in Russia and it would draft a list of German state and public figures who were “involved in restricting the broadcasting of RT DE and otherwise putting pressure on a Russian media operator”. They would be banned from entering Russia, the ministry said. DW’s director general, Peter Limbourg, said in a broadcast interview that Moscow’s retaliation exceeded his expectations. “We had been expecting some measures by the Russian side, but I think this is a total overreaction from the Russian government,” he said, adding that it was “another sign that the Russian government is not interested in press freedom and freedom of opinion”. He said: “Even if we have to leave the country, we will intensify our reporting on the country. We will not just ignore what is happening in Russia, we will report. And we will do more and more.” RT’s head, Margarita Simonyan, hailed the decision and suggested that further retaliation could lead to all German media being expelled. RT DE had already been under considerable pressure. YouTube removed the channel from its site last year. On Wednesday the Russian foreign ministry said it would retaliate against “internet intermediaries” that had blocked the channel, in an apparent warning to YouTube. RT has been required to register as a foreign agent in the US and has faced heightened scrutiny from Ofcom in the UK. The regulator has fined RT for breaching impartiality rules in its coverage of Syria and the Salisbury poisoning.",News/World news,Russia to expel German broadcaster after RT blocked in Germany,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/russia-to-expel-german-broadcaster-after-rt-banned-in-germany
2/4/2022,"On the eve of these Olympics, which have been scarred by more controversy and tone deafness than any since Moscow in 1980, Thomas Bach was asked a simple question. What was his message to the Uighur population of China, who believe they are being repressed? Say what you want about the president of the International Olympic Committee. But 36 years after he won a fencing gold medal, he retains an uncanny ability to parry and evade.  “With regards to the Uighur population, the position of the IOC must be to give political neutrality,” replied Bach, before offering a history lesson on how the Ancient Games in Greece came to an end after a thousand years because of Roman interference. “We are not commenting on political issues because … if we get in the middle of intentions and disputes and confrontations of political powers then we are putting the Games at risk.” Bach was aiming for realpolitik, and also not to upset his hosts. The problem with his strategy was that it was bound to upset everyone else. To claim an equivalence between the Chinese Communist Party and the Uighur muslims, the powerful and the powerless, the elite and the damned, was damning enough. But when set against the backdrop of harrowing stories of millions of Uighurs being forced into re-education camps, where some claim they have been raped or sterilised, his comments felt as cold as the tip of his old foil blade. Human rights groups, who have dubbed these the “Genocide Games”, will attempt to keep the world’s attention on the issue by protesting outside the White House on Saturday. But in China, which denies any abuses in Xinjiang and calls the allegations the “lie of the century”, such criticism is an irrelevance. For them the focus of these Olympics is on delivery and glory. China Daily, the official English-language mouthpiece for the Chinese government, reckoned on Thursday that the excitement for the Winter Games has already “hit fever pitch” in Beijing. They might be right. But what might be an iron truth could also be rampant propaganda; the sporting equivalent of reporting record grain harvests in a famine. It is impossible to know. That is because of a second strand running through these Games: the “closed loop” Covid regulations which are the most restrictive in history. For all their time in Beijing, athletes, officials and journalists will be cordoned off from the outside world; their lives restricted to the airport, hotel, special buses and the Olympic venues. Escaping the bubble is impossible. In the Guardian’s case it would involve evading nearly a dozen hotel security guards and vaulting over a 10-foot high fence. Beijing police have even warned locals to stay away from Olympic vehicles in the event of an accident. Even so, some of the world’s leading athletes will miss out. The top women’s ski jumper, Marita Kramer of Austria, is one of them, having failed to recover from the virus in time to make it to the Chinese capital. Others are in a government isolation facility, hoping they will be out in time. So far no British athlete is among them. Such measures are ostensibly designed to prevent Covid running rampant in the local population. But they have a handy byproduct of keeping journalists and athletes pegged in and perhaps less willing to speak out too. In this area, however, Bach was more encouraging and forceful, promising that freedom of speech would be protected. “We had this in Tokyo, it will be here, it will be in Paris, it’s irrespective of the host of the Games,” he added. There was, however, a kicker, with Bach clearly hoping that athletes will keep controversial opinions to themselves. “If an actor is engaging in a theatre playing Hamlet, then nobody ever asks the question when playing Hamlet he must or should express during the play his political opinion,” he said at one point. “The same is true for the athletes.” To protest or not to protest, that is the question. Meanwhile there was also good news for domestic fans, with organisers confirming that 150,000 spectators would be invited to attend events in the coming fortnight. No international supporters have been allowed into China, however. So what of Britain’s chances? There is always more jeopardy in winter sports than in their summer equivalent, where the risk of a crash landing is higher than on a track or bike. Nonetheless it is not out of the question that Britain beats its record of five medals at a Winter Games, with its world champion curlers and Charlotte Bankes in the snowboard cross leading the charge. Elsewhere the Jamaican four-man bobsleigh team will bring nostalgia and diversity to a Games that remains overwhelming white. But the battle to be the star of these Olympics is likely to be between Eileen Gu, a Chinese athlete born in California, who is gunning for three gold medals in the big air, slopestyle and halfpipe, and the American skier Mikaela Shiffrin. Shiffrin already has three golds to her name and, if she can bag another three, she will become the most decorated Olympic alpine skier in history. But she has already admitted that the pressure is on, saying: “It’s not like rainbows and sunshine and butterflies and everything that people sort of say.” Speaking of history, when the Games are declared open on Friday, Beijing will become the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics. History, of course, is different from legacy. While that legacy is yet to be fully written, the early chapters are not exactly encouraging.",Sport/Sport,The elite and the damned: Beijing 2022 begins with dose of realpolitik,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/03/the-elite-and-the-damned-beijing-2022-begins-with-dose-of-realpolitik
2/4/2022,"Authorities in Argentina are advising drug consumers to throw away any cocaine they may have purchased in the last two days after at least 20 people died after ingesting adulterated cocaine in the Greater Buenos Aires area.  Eighty-four others are are currently under intensive care, of which 20 have been intubated, but authorities fear the death toll could increase as further victims are found to have died alone at home. Dozens of the victims were saved after they were intubated in intensive care units usually reserved for Covid patients, Buenos Aires province health minister Nicolás Kreplak said on Thursday. “If it hadn’t been because of our pandemic preparedness, the number of victims would be far higher,” Kreplak told reporters outside the Bocalandro hospital where a number of patients are interned. The tainted cocaine causes lethal cardiac and respiratory arrest in less than an hour, prompting authorities to issue an epidemiological alert warning the public not to consume any cocaine they may have purchased in the last two days. Many victims have been taken ill almost immediately and died in their homes. Harrowing scenes of convulsing victims arriving at hospitals in private cars and being carried inside by relatives have been shown on television news and shared on social media. Most of the victims seemed to be male and between the ages of 30 and 50, according to early reports. Early speculation pointed to a turf war in which the cocaine could have been spiked by rival drug gangs trying to squeeze competitors out of the market. But that hypothesis is now giving way to the view that the tainted cocaine was cut with a poorly manufactured opioid. “We have indirect evidence it was cut with an opioid, because patients who receive the opioid antidote [naloxone] recover very quickly,” said Buenos Aires security minister Sergio Berni. The minister speculated that the opioid may have been poorly manufactured in a drug “kitchen” rather than stolen from a pharmaceutical company because of its deadly effect. Paraguayan drug dealer Joaquín “El Paisa” Aquino was arrested overnight and authorities speculated he could be connected to the tainted drugs. In the operation, police seized 15,000 packages of cocaine in magenta polythene wrappers, similar to those which survivors of the tainted drugs had purchased. “In principle, it would seem that it is the same batch and the same substance, but this is all preliminary, there is nothing definitive,” Buenos Aires crime secretary Francisco Pont Verges told the press. Officials said the victims had purchased the cocaine at drug dens in Puerta 8, a low-income district in the Greater Buenos Aires area. “It is a regular place for retail drug sales and it has been raided several times,” said prosecutor Marcelo Lapargo. “But we are now talking about an event of a different nature, because one thing is the sale of drugs at these dens … and the death of so many people is quite another. We are extremely anxious today to tell those who are in possession of this poison that they should not consume it.” Cocaine consumption is high in Greater Buenos Aires, where 200,000 individual doses are sold each day among a population of about 15 million people, according to media reports. The illegal drug business accounted for $1.1bn in sales in Argentina during 2017, according to the most recent studies, the daily Infobae reported Thursday.",News/World news,Argentinians urged to throw out cocaine after tainted batches kill at least 20,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/argentina-tainted-cocaine-deaths-officials
2/4/2022,"For nearly two decades, the man who came to be known as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi was a central figure in the terror juggernaut that became the Islamic State. From fighter, to prisoner, strategist to leader, there were not many parts of the insurgency in which the 46-year-old jihadist had not had a hand. Born Amir Mohammed Abdul Rahman al-Mawli al-Salbi in the northern Iraqi district of Mahalabiya, Qurayshi, who was killed by US special forces in Syria on Thursday, was to become one of the most committed proponents of some of its most savage acts. He played a lead role in the genocide of the Yazidis, which led to the killing of thousands of men killed and the enslavement of women and girls. He was deeply involved in the overthrow of Mosul in mid-2014, the success of which paralysed a region and the armies of two nation states. And he orchestrated mass killings of Shia civilians and members of the security forces.  Like many IS leaders, Qurayshi had served in Saddam Hussein’s military, where he became an officer and – by definition, a member of the Ba’ath party – an unusual port of call for someone described as ideological during his years at Mosul University, where he studied sharia law. His path to the leadership of IS followed another familiar path – a spell in the US prison Camp Bucca in southern Iraq, where he met his predecessor as IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and others who would later propel him to the terror group’s most senior role. Like the rest of the Bucca alumni, Qurayshi honed his skills in the back rooms of Iraq’s towns and cities on his release. They eventually served as a breeding ground for an insurrection that was without precedent in modern history. By the time Mosul fell, he had risen to be one of Baghdadi’s most trusted advisers, along with a handful of other seasoned hands who helped shape the course of the conflict in both Iraq and Syria. Yet for such an instrumental insurgent, little was known about him. When IS announced Qurayshi as a replacement for Baghdadi when he too was killed by US special forces, the name was not known to western intelligence agencies. It took several months for them to link the nom de guerre to al-Salbi. Nevertheless, the new name stuck and for the last two years he had been one of the most wanted men in the world. Qurayshi was thought to have initially been hiding near Mosul, familiar terrain to a man from the area, but by Christmas it became clear that he was instead in Syria, where other senior IS members – including Baghdadi – had sought sanctuary. His death comes close to ending the old guard, who caused so much destruction. While he remained a relative unknown throughout his two years as leader, the next cadre of IS leaders, who were much lower ranked during the early years, are now stepping into the breach with much less known about them. Qurayshi’s legacy could well end up being who he was able to groom to replace him.",News/World news,Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi: who was the Iraqi killed by US forces?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/abu-ibrahim-al-hashimi-al-qurayshi-islamic-state-leader-killed
2/4/2022,"Magnus Carlsen was a class apart from his rivals last week at Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee, the “chess Wimbledon”. The No 1 capped a dominant performance with a virtuoso final game against an old rival, an unbeaten 9.5/13 total, and a record eighth victory. He has finished first at Wijk on more than half his appearances there, and the organisers have promised a gold-plated trophy if he makes it to 10 victories at the small Dutch North Sea resort. Norway’s world champion, 31, said that he felt “really good about my play. To some extent I took the obvious chances and left the more difficult ones on the table, which suggests there’s still quite a bit of room for improvement, but overall I’m very happy.”  Carlsen reckoned to have had nine winning positions, but converted only five of them. He gained just three rating points, reaching 2868 in his stated quest for an all-time record 2900 rating, which he previously got within sight of in 2014 and 2019, when his peaks were 2889 and 2882. Carlsen’s penultimate round endgame win against Fabiano Caruana, his opponent in the 2018 world title match, was a vintage demonstration of how active pieces, here the black bishops, can defeat a more powerful but passive army, here the white rooks. However, it was his earlier game against Shak Mamedyarov, second on tie-break at Wijk, which attracted most praise, not least from the loser, who called it “an absolutely fantastic game… In 27 moves he played 25 engine first lines… I don’t know when I last lost like this without any chance.” Carlsen said: “I think that was certainly my best game… I just made some very, very good decisions, and the way chess has become now, you judge yourself on whether the engines like your play, and whenever you feel like you’ve played a good game it’s nice to get that confirmed.” The chess circuit moves to Berlin on Friday for the opening round of the Fide Grand Prix. This is a series of three elite tournaments, two in the German capital and one in Belgrade, which will decide the final two places in this summer’s eight-player Candidates in Madrid. Those qualified so far are Alireza Firouzja (France) and Fabiano Caruana (US) from the Fide Grand Swiss, Jan-Krzysztof Duda (Poland) and Sergey Karjakin (Russia) from the World Cup, Ian Nepomniachtchi (Russia) as loser of the 2021 title match, and Teimour Radjabov (Azerbaijan) as Fide nominee. Berlin began with a shock even before the first pawn was pushed. China’s world No 3, Ding Liren, the favourite in the eyes of many to win both the Grand Prix and the Candidates, withdrew due to visa problems so cannot now qualify as a Candidate. Ding has been very unlucky. His preparation for the 2020 Candidates was disrupted by a requirement to quarantine in Moscow before the tournament, while his results in the 2021 online Champions Tour were handicapped by poor internet connections and by playing hours which favoured his European and US rivals. In Ding’s absence, the US has a strong hand in the Grand Prix, with Wesley So, Levon Aronian and Hikaru Nakamura all having chances, while Mamedyarov is in fine form after his success in Wijk. Several others, including Russia’s Alexander Grischuk and France’s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, should also in the frame. Rounds start at 2pm daily from Friday. Two weeks from now, Carlsen begins the defence of his title in the online Meltwater Champions Tour, which opens on 19 February with the Airthings Masters. The format has been streamlined since last year. Won games now count for three points instead of two, while the quarter-finals and semi-finals are sped up from two days to one. The field of 16 includes Ding, Nepomniachtchi, five teenagers led by the world rapid champion, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, 17, and the women’s world rapid champion, Alexandra Kosteniuk. Carlsen is taking on a sizeable commitment in 2022 with his ambitious 2900 target while simultaneously playing the online tour with its different rhythms, challenges and time limits. Will it all prove too much, even for this exceptional world champion? Time will tell. The men’s team won the £100,000 Battle of the Sexes match which finished on Thursday in Gibraltar, scoring a clear 53-47 margin. Teams were 10-a-side, while average ages and Fide ratings were closely matched. The women’s team had a strong start and were 13-7 ahead after two rounds, but their missed chances in good positions proved costly. Olga Girya, the only Russian on the women’s team, surprised Joe Gallagher in the King’s Indian, an opening about which the former British champion has written several books. After the unusual 6 Be3!? e5 7 Qc2!? Qe7? 8 Nd5! White was already on top, and the blunder 19…Be8? only hastened defeat. Have you ever heard Emanuel Lasker or José Capablanca speak, or Vassily Smyslov sing? Many keen chess fans could easily recognise the voices of most or all of the world champions from Boris Spassky to Carlsen, but audiotapes by earlier greats are rare. Edward Winter’s online Chess Notes has just published a recording of Lasker, who held the world crown a record 27 years, interviewed during the 1935 Alexander Alekhine v Max Euwe title match. One startling claim by Lasker is that Alekhine did not lose a game playing Black in the Ruy Lopez 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 for around 30 years. The reality, still impressive, is that the unbeaten sequence was 16 years, from a 1921 game up to 1937, when Alekhine lost to Paul Keres at Margate in a famous 23-mover. Capablanca, who beat Lasker in 1921 then lost to Alekhine in 1927, is heard talking in English when congratulated on his 50th birthday at Avro 1938. Later that day the Cuban lost to Alekhine and had a poor finish to Avro, usually blamed on a mini-stroke during the tournament. However, Capablanca himself gave a different explanation in the course of a long and interesting interview at Buenos Aires 1939. Smyslov, world champion 1957-58, once auditioned for the Bolshoi, and sometimes sang at the end of tournaments, accompanied by the concert pianist Mark Taimanov. Here he is on YouTube. 3801 1 Qc6+!

2/4/2022,"Millions of households face a 54% energy bill hike from 1 April after the regulator Ofgem lifted the cap on default tariffs to the equivalent of just under £2,000 a year for an average user.  The price cap is a limit on a unit of gas and electricity – it’s not a cap on customers’ overall energy bills, which will still rise or fall in line with their energy use. Under the new Ofgem cap, the average dual-fuel bill for a direct debit customer will go up by £693 a year, from its current level of £1,277. This will affect 22 million households. The news is even worse for people who pay via other methods. About 4.5 million households use a prepayment meter, and they face a typical hike of £708 – from £1,309 to £2,017. Meanwhile, those customers who pay for their energy with cash or by cheque face an average bill of £2,101 for their gas and electricity. From 1 April a typical customer paying by direct debit will be charged 28p a kilowatt-hour for electricity and 7p a kWh for gas. This is about double the unit prices being charged by the cheapest providers at the start of 2021. For anyone with above-average energy use – for example, large families or older people in draughty homes – their annual bill could be much higher than the headlines suggest. The government said all households will receive £200 off their energy bills, and will then pay this “loan” back at a rate of £40 a year over five yearsfrom 2023. But the bad news is that this help does not arrive until the autumn, when energy bills may be even higher. That is because Ofgem is due to update – and almost certainly push up – the price cap when it makes its next announcement in August. If it does, bills will rise in October, just as the repayable discount is due. The energy bills measure will provide about 28 million households with an upfront discount on their bills worth £200. Energy suppliers will apply this to domestic electricity customers from October, with the government picking up the tab initially. This scheme will apply across England, Scotland and Wales (energy policy is devolved in Northern Ireland, so the Northern Ireland executive will be funded to provide comparable support, say ministers). There is the warm home discount scheme, which currently offers a £140 discount to those on certain benefits during the winter months. The government has confirmed it is going ahead with previously announced proposals to expand eligibility for the scheme by almost a third, so that 3 million vulnerable households will now benefit, as well as a planned £10 uplift to £150 from October. At the moment, discounts are given automatically to people on pension credit, but other low-income households must apply and will get help only if their providers offer the scheme and there is still money available. To qualify, you need to receive one of a list of means-tested state benefits. Energy suppliers set their own criteria but jobseeker’s allowance, income support and child tax credit are typically on the list. There are various other grants and forms of assistance. For example, there are cold weather payments: one-off amounts to help people pay for extra heating costs when it is very cold. Citizens Advice explains that you will only be eligible if you already receive certain benefits. It adds that if you are in debt to your energy supplier, you may be able to obtain a grant from one of the firms’ hardship funds to help pay it off. In England, council taxpayers in properties falling in bands A-D will get a £150 refund in April – the same month that council tax is set to go up. The average council tax bill for a band D property is £1,898, and councils can increase bills by up to 3% this year without holding a referendum. Many have indicated they intend to do so, which will add £57 to the annual bill and eat into the benefit of the rebate. Those who pay by direct debit will automatically receive £150 in their bank account. For other customers, the Treasury says: “Councils will be ready to process their claims in April.” The devolved nations have been given funding that can be used for a similar scheme. Many households will qualify for the repayable energy discount and the council tax rebate, so will receive £350 worth of assistance this year. Those who meet new qualifying criteria for the warm homes discount will be able to get another £150 worth of assistance, although that may not be refunded until the end of next winter. In total that means £500 worth of help – albeit £200 of that is to be repaid.",Lifestyle/Money,What help is Sunak offering as households face cost-of-living crisis?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/03/what-help-is-rishi-sunak-offering-cost-of-living-crisis-energy-price-cap
2/4/2022,"All coaches insist they never read the newspapers until the day comes when they wish to send a specific message. Thus it is that Eddie Jones spent a large chunk of his pre-Six Nations address insisting Scotland are the nailed-on favourites who will have to cope with the pressure of their lofty status. Say it often enough and maybe a few seeds of doubt can be quietly sown.  The flip side, of course, is what that implies about his own team and a tournament buildup which has been on the grisly side of horrible. No Owen Farrell, Courtney Lawes or Manu Tuilagi. Ditto Jonny May, Sam Underhill, Jonny Hill, the Vunipola brothers, Joe Launchbury and Anthony Watson. A forced evacuation from the team hotel last week because of a fire nearby. A starting winger who has been training in isolation at home this week. Small wonder Jones is trying to shift people’s gaze elsewhere, even publicly suggesting Scotland are “probably two years ahead of us in terms of their development.” Er, what does that say about England’s strategic thinking since spring 2020? In fairness to Jones, he has made the best of a tricky selectorial hand in this instance. Tom Curry’s elevation to the captaincy at just 23 years old, making him the youngest England skipper since Will Carling in 1988, has been a popular move in the team room, while in several other positions the head coach has opted for the slightly bolder of the available options. It would have been easy, particularly with a foul weather forecast, to have stitched together a more orthodox combination. Instead, for better or worse, he has clung to the theme of a “new” England who, regardless of the odds, are not going to die wondering. A revved-up back row of Curry, Lewis Ludlam and Sam Simmonds will attempt to play Scotland’s flankers at their own disruptive game and, for once, Premiership form has clearly been taken into account. Brian Moore will commentate on his last men's Six Nations match for the BBC when Scotland host England on Saturday.Moore has worked alongside co-commentator Eddie Butler for the past two decades.  The former England hooker will continue to commentate for the BBC on the women's Six Nations.  In a tweet, Moore said: ""My England career began with a Calcutta Cup, and my BBC co-comms career on the Men's 6 Nations will end on Saturday with another. Thank you to all at BBC Sport, especially my mate, Eddie Butler. It's been a privilege to work on some unforgettable sporting  occasions."" Both Nick Isiekwe and Elliot Daly have been producing for Saracens of late and, rightly, Jones has also retained Marcus Smith at fly-half, ignoring those who felt George Smith’s kicking would have been a more valuable horse for this particular course. If Jones had instead started Ford, who like Daly and Isiekwe was omitted from his original 36-man training squad, what message would that have sent about the management’s faith in the 22-year-old No 10? Instead, regardless of a few spots of rain, the boyish Smith has been invited to show he is already a man for all seasons. And if he can go toe to toe with Scotland’s creative director, Finn Russell, perhaps the reports of England’s certain demise will prove premature. Daly and Henry Slade may be the 21st different centre combination selected by Jones but they top the all-comers list for bazooka-length left-footed kicking options. With both Joe Marchant and Freddie Steward excellent in the air and Max Malins capable of popping up anywhere, Jones certainly has a backline perfectly suited to a helter-skelter game of chargedowns and skidding 50:22 attempts. Even the two most marginal calls – Ellis Genge over Joe Marler at loosehead prop and Simmonds over Alex Dombrandt at No 8 – look deliberately calibrated to ensure England have sufficient bench strength to replicate the second-half surge that ultimately took South Africa clear of Scotland in November. It also just happens to be how England ended up nicking the 2020 match in similarly bad conditions, albeit with Genge in the role of try-scoring replacement on that occasion. That said, what England currently lack is the hulking power and aura that has traditionally been their calling card. It puts a major onus on their set piece, their discipline around the tackle area – where Hamish Watson is so effective – and the ability of Genge, Simmonds, Kyle Sinckler and Luke Cowan-Dickie to carry dynamically enough to rock the Scots backwards. Ludlam , recalled for his first Test start for two years, will also be a crucial all-court cog. Interestingly, he is one of just five starting survivors from the 2020 Calcutta Cup game and is the type of player guaranteed to give heart and soul whatever the bookies or meteorologists say. As Jones told Sky News: “They brag about getting under the skin of England but we’ll see on Saturday. It’ll be mind over emotions for us. They’ll go at Marcus and guys like Genge and Sinckler but we feel all those guys will be able to handle it.” Game on.",Sport/Sport,"For better or worse, Eddie Jones is sticking with his ‘new’ England | Robert Kitson",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/03/for-better-or-worse-eddie-jones-is-sticking-with-his-new-england
2/4/2022,"Just before Christmas, Adam McKay released his all-star apocalypse satire Don’t Look Up, in which the political and media classes’ refusal to understand the danger of an approaching mega-comet was symbolic of climate-crisis denial. Sadly, that impeccably intentioned film turned out to be the celeb-comedy equivalent of Gal Gadot’s Imagine video. But its admirers said those critics disliking it were, as journalists, naturally complicit in the problem, and that they didn’t care about the environment. This liberal-arts version of Trumpian journalist-hate was all the odder as most of those expressing it were themselves journalists. None of these issues apply to Moonfall, a film that is part of the well-established but humbler “disaster” genre, which paradoxically signals its lack of real concern in its deadly serious manner combined with a tacitly agreed happy ending, as opposed to satire concluding in tragedy. This bizarrely leaden new example of the action spectacular is from Roland Emmerich, a longtime master of these end-of-the-world-but-not-really films. But here the formulaic silliness, sometimes part of the enjoyment, is just tiring.  The idea is that the moon is spinning away from its axis towards us, causing environmental catastrophe down here on Earth. An ancient Nasa official working in a basement, played inevitably by Donald Sutherland, whisperingly confirms this awful truth. Patrick Wilson – set fair to be the Leslie Nielsen of his generation – plays maverick astronaut Brian Harper, who was unfairly dismissed for alleged incompetence which destroyed a satellite 10 years before, though actually it was his heroism that saved the life of his colleague Jo Fowler (Halle Berry), who is now a Nasa big cheese. Meanwhile, a wacky Brit weirdo with freaky theories about the moon is starting to get traction online: this is KC Houseman, played by John Bradley (Samwell Tarly from Game of Thrones), and it’s a rather Simon Pegg-ish role requiring much dorkishness. As the moon looms ever closer, with CGI waves washing over buildings, Nasa and the joint chiefs swallow their pride and realise that they’re going to have to send a special mission of freethinking heroes and heroines up to the moon to get it sorted: Brian, Jo and goofy KC. Meanwhile their stepfamilies have tense adventures back on Earth. It should be a laugh; it doesn’t pretend to be anything else, and certainly doesn’t aspire to contemporary satire. But the zany and somewhat Jules Verne-type revelations don’t put new life into the disaster genre; rather it feels as though the shark has jumped over the moon, resulting in what feel like hours and hours of solemn gibberish. For all the faults of Don’t Look Up, it was at least addressing something real and relevant. In this film the moon has fallen with a terrible clunk.  Moonfall is released on 4 February in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Moonfall review – bad moon rising… and I mean really bad,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/moonfall-review-halle-berry-patrick-wilson-roland-emmerich
2/4/2022,"The alpine skier Dave Ryding has suggested he might cut his medal in half and give it to his “hero” Alain Baxter, who was controversially stripped of bronze in 2002, if he makes the podium at the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Ryding made the pledge as he was named as one of Team GB’s two flagbearers for Friday’s opening ceremony, alongside the curler Eve Muirhead. Both athletes will be competing in their fourth Games.  Baxter, who lost his medal after he tested positive for a stimulant contained in a Vicks nasal inhaler bought in Salt Lake City that was not in the same product sold in the UK, is now working as one of Ryding’s assistant coaches. Ryding, who recently won his first World Cup race, said he wanted to give something back to the man who inspired him to become an alpine skier. “Alain is working with my team now,” he said. “He’s one of the assistant coaches. I remember growing up watching him. I was then fortunate enough to do a few months before he retired – they put me on to his team for a few months so I knew him quite well. I still remember watching him win the medal and it ignited something inside me whether it was passion, excitement, thrill. I don’t know what it was. “But I can still remember really getting this feeling and Alain will always be – whatever I achieve, Alain for me will be here because that’s how you perceive your heroes. If he didn’t do what he did in Salt Lake, who knows if I would have had the drive, the belief to do what I did?” Even though Baxter’s medal was taken away, Ryding said that it had not tarnished Baxter’s legacy in his eyes. “What went on after that was proven that it shouldn’t have been taken away and it was such unfortunate circumstances,” he said. “God help us that no one has to go through it again. It affected our sport. It affected him massively. If I was to get a medal, I think the best thing I could do was cut it in half and give him half of it.” Asked about carrying the flag, Ryding said: “I never dreamed of it. I was shocked to be asked. I am beyond proud to lead out the team.” Muirhead, who will lead the women’s curling team, expressed her shock and delight at being selected to carry the flag alongside Ryding. “To be asked to be one of the two flagbearers, it’s honestly like a dream come true,” she said. “It has been a rollercoaster to get here. I feel so honoured.” Muirhead also praised the mixed doubles team of Bruce Mouat and Jennifer Dodds, who are still in a good position with two wins and a defeat after beating the Canada team 6-4 and losing to Switzerland 8-7 on the second day of competition. “I don’t think there is anything stopping us coming away with three medals in the curling,” Muirhead said. “Bruce and the men’s team are the best in the world. And for us, we are capable of beating everyone out there.” Team GB chef de mission, Georgie Harland, confirmed that 28 of Britain’s 50 athletes for the Games are now in Beijing, and said none of them had tested positive for Covid since arriving. “The talent is there to give us our best performance at a Winter Olympics,” she said.",Sport/Sport,GB flagbearer Dave Ryding would ‘cut medal in half’ to honour Alain Baxter ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/03/flagbearer-dave-ryding-cut-medal-in-half-alain-baxter-team-gb-winter-olympics
2/4/2022,"Rishi Sunak has been playing the long game. Keeping his head down – there can be an upside to one of your close family getting Covid – and offering the bare minimum of support to the prime minister to appear loyal. Just hoping it was only a matter of time before the Met got round to fingering The Suspect’s collar and the necessary 54 no confidence letters were submitted to the chair of the 1922 Committee. Then and only then would he show his hand. It was with the greatest sadness and the utmost humility etc, etc that he was putting his name forward to become the new leader of the Tory party.  But on Thursday the chancellor was forced out of hiding to come to the Commons to give a statement on energy prices and the cost of living. It could have been a moment of some danger. An admission that people were getting worse off on his watch. Only he just about managed to ignore all that. Rather he made it all about his own brilliance. Just imagine how much worse everything would be if it hadn’t been for him! Dishi Rishi is turning out to be almost as much the narcissist as Big Dog. Even if his narcissism is more manicured and curated. Either way, he should have no trouble settling down in No 10. Sunak’s whole speech was a catalogue of reasons to be profoundly grateful for his existence. He claimed the UK was the fastest growing economy and there were more people in work than before the pandemic, before insisting that inflation running at 6% had nothing to do with him. Er … you’re the chancellor. He then went to say the energy price cap would be going up by £693 and that he would be offsetting that with a £200 loan, to be repaid over five years, and a £150 council tax rebate. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, pointed out some obvious flaws with this. There was no guarantee energy prices wouldn’t continue to rise and, even if they didn’t, millions of people were going to be cold, hungry and broke. So how about cutting VAT, extending the warm homes discount and imposing a windfall tax on energy companies? It would be wrong to cut VAT, said Sunak, sounding most put out, as that would not target the poorest households. A bizarre line as he had moments earlier suggested cutting VAT was one of the great Brexit dividends. Presumably, another one that we will never see. As for the energy companies, they would be bankrupted by further taxes. After all, Shell had only quadrupled its profits to £14bn that very day. They were nearly on the breadline. Would no one think of the shareholders? This wasn’t the sharpest of defences but it was the best that Rishi could offer. Getting out alive and with his vanity more or less unpunctured was about as much as could be hoped for. Deep down, he knew someone would have to be back with a better bailout package before long. But hopefully, he would no longer be chancellor by that time. Besides which, he had a more immediate hazard to deal with: an interview with the BBC. Sunak had hoped he would be able to keep the conversation on the subject of his own fabulousness. Laura Kuenssberg wanted to talk parties. No, he’d never once looked out of the window of No 11. He’d had them all blacked out so he could focus on his work. Therefore he couldn’t have seen anything. And he’d certainly never seen any cake. Or been near a cake. Or knew what a cake was. It would be up to Sue Gray to tell him if he’d ever seen any wrongdoing. And of course The Suspect had never lied to him. Big Dog had prefaced every conversation with, “You know I’m lying to you …” so he must have been telling the truth. He was the prime minister! And prime ministers never lie. Even one whose main contribution to public life has been to make almost everyone disbelieve everything he said. Then Sunak turned coy. Of course it was impossible to believe that Johnson could have done anything wrong, he simpered. But if he had, then he was terribly flattered some MPs were considering him as a future leader. Not that he knew why! Though it could have been something to do the dinners he had been hosting and the promises he had made. Just a thought. Still. Even though the chancellor’s interview hadn’t gone entirely to plan, he was much cheered by the fact that it wasn’t as much of a car wreck as Johnson’s. Big Dog had been up in Blackpool, trying to convince locals he was committed to the levelling-up agenda and that money previously promised could count as new providing it hadn’t already been spent. Brilliant. Then things fell apart. First he trashed the Northern Ireland protocol that he himself had negotiated as completely useless. Way to go, Boris. Then he tried to backtrack on his Jimmy Savile slur against Keir Starmer. Despite letting several of his more abject cabinet ministers defend him for it. What he had really meant to say was that he identified with the Labour leader. Like him, he had been trying to take responsibility for others’ wrongdoings. It was yet another lie of course. He breathes, he lies. The Suspect’s whole strategy over partygate has been the exact opposite of Starmer’s. His sole aim being to let others take the blame for him. And even when he tries to feign empathy – impossible for a shameless sociopath – he can’t even manage to mouth an insincere apology. He is the man that has never been able to say sorry. Under the circumstances, it wasn’t nearly enough. But it was way too much for Munira Mirza, his policy adviser of 10 years. She resigned. Big Dog had finally crossed a line. She couldn’t carry on giving him the benefit of the doubt when there was no doubt. Sunak couldn’t believe his luck. Was this the beginning of the end?

2/4/2022,"The worst part of anything film-related is the context-free montage. The worst part of going to the cinema is being pummelled with a context-free montage of upcoming attractions before the movie starts. The worst part of watching awards shows is being pummelled with context-free montages of all the films that were released in the previous 12 months. A context-free montage is less than a trailer. It isn’t even an advert. It’s a sizzle reel that reveals nothing about anything. There is no information. It’s the movie equivalent of sitting in front of the washing machine as a kid.  However, Netflix prides itself on being a bold new disruptor in the movie industry, so it only makes sense that it should also boldly disrupt the context-free montage genre. Behold, Netflix’s new 2022 movie preview video, where the montage talks to you. Netflix’s movie preview ultimately serves two purposes. The first is to tell you all the films that are coming out this year, in the form of an over-edited supercut. And if that’s your thing, there’s plenty to dissect here. There’s going to be a sequel to Enola Holmes, a sequel to Knives Out, a Russo Brothers movie where Ryan Gosling appears to be playing Jason Bourne, an animated Guillermo Del Toro Pinocchio movie, one of those Adam Sandler movies that critics like, a film with Kevin Hart and Mark Wahlberg, a neat-looking animated pirate movie and something called We Have a Ghost. Some of it looks fantastic, lots of it looks mediocre and some of it – were their success measured in traditional box office grosses – look destined to be monumental flops. But that’s not the real reason why Netflix made the montage, though. No, the real reason for the montage was to allow Netflix to gratuitously flex all over the place. Because, at key points during the montage, the stars themselves turn and address us in the middle of the action. This is a big deal. Previously, it had been considered a big deal if a movie star listlessly presented a clip of the movie from an independently shot clip of them in full blown junket mode. But this is something else. This is a demonstration that Netflix has the power to shut down a movie’s production so that the star – on location, in costume and from within the scene of the movie they’re making – can promote the platform. It starts with Jennifer Lopez, scowling on a boat in a wooly hat. “Tonight is movie night,” she sighs with weary resignation. Next is Chris Hemsworth, wearing glasses. “In here is the great big world,” he intones with all the enthusiasm of someone ordering a starter from a restaurant that only serves human faeces. I’m not going to type out everything that all the stars say, because it adds up to the sort of inept tone poem usually reserved for cologne adverts, but I will list the other stars who talk. Jason Momoa, dressed as a sort of militaristic sex goat. Jamie Foxx, driving a car. Ryan Gosling, fighting a guy on a tram. Henry Cavill and Millie Bobby Brown, walking down an alley. Queen Latifah, overlit next to a car. Mark Wahlberg and Kevin Hart, pretending they’re 20 years younger than they actually are. Halle Berry, looking into a hole. Ryan Reynolds, in a lift. Kerry Washington, dressed as royalty. Charlize Theron, dressed as Noddy Holder. Judging by their slightly downbeat demeanour, it’s safe to assume that all these actors were all just getting into the swing of filming when a Netflix representative shut everything down and got them to read out their line of their meaningless spiel. None of them are happy about it. Charlize Theron actively looks like she had to be tranquillised to do it. But that doesn’t matter. They still did it. Once again, Netflix triumphs over the human spirit. Presumably, none of these stars did this for free. There was a line in their contract stipulating their appearance, and probably a slightly increased pay packet. But what’s interesting to see is who held out. Adam Sandler didn’t say anything. Daniel Craig didn’t say anything. Eddie Murphy didn’t say anything. Julia Louis-Dreyfus didn’t say anything. Mark Ruffalo was standing right next to Ryan Reynolds in his clip, but he didn’t so much as think about saying anything. Mark Ruffalo cannot be bought or sold. His integrity is rock solid. Despite this, though, the message is loud and clear. Netflix has some films out this year. And it can make the most famous people on Earth dance like performing monkeys whenever it wants.",Arts/Film,Netflix’s 2022 preview trailer is a ghoulish nightmare of coerced A-listers | Stuart Heritage,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/netflix-2022-preview-trailer-montage
2/4/2022,"“If anybody here questions the need for the police to change, I am here to tell you that it’s time to face up to reality.” After yet another shameful week for the police, those words could have been spoken yesterday. But in fact they date back seven years to a furious showdown between the then home secretary, Theresa May, and a stony-faced Police Federation. The cherished British ideal of policing by consent was, she told them, in danger of being destroyed by scandals ranging from the covert surveillance of murder victim Stephen Lawrence’s family to allegations of corruption, bribe-taking and covering up fatal police errors during the Hillsborough football stadium disaster. At the time, May thought it was worrying that only two-thirds of the public trusted the police to tell the truth. Now that feels like a figure from some lost golden age.  An Ipsos-Mori poll this week found that fewer than a third of Britons are confident that the police investigation of alleged lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street will actually result in anyone who broke Covid rules getting punished, while considerably fewer than half expect the police to be thorough or independent. The Metropolitan police’s strange, foot-dragging reluctance to investigate, at least until shamed into it by a Whitehall inquiry, now looks like a catastrophic misjudgment; how could it not see that this was about showing that nobody, no matter how powerful, is above the law? But it wouldn’t have been so damaging had it not reinforced a more longstanding sense that something has gone very wrong in British policing. Fear and distrust of the police is, sadly, nothing new in some communities, stemming often from bitter experience. But it’s spreading now to parts of society where officers would once automatically have enjoyed the benefit of the doubt. The publication this week of a series of stomach-churning WhatsApps exchanged between officers at Charing Cross station – in which they joked casually about hitting their wives and girlfriends or turning “Africans” into dogfood – has reawakened all the same fears stirred up by the murder of Sarah Everard at the hands of a serving Met police officer, and the revelation that officers posed for grotesque selfies with the bodies of murdered sisters Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry. These are the men we’re expected to call on at our most frightened and vulnerable, in the wake of a sexual assault or after having finally summoned the courage to escape a violent relationship, for heaven’s sake. Yet one of them messaged a female colleague “I would happily rape you” – supposedly in jest. And while this particular Independent Office for Police Conduct investigation involves the Met, there’s no reason to expect such attitudes magically stop at the edge of London. Greater Manchester police was judged by an inquiry last year to be so badly run as to be actively putting public safety at risk. Victims of crimes including domestic violence waited in some cases weeks for a police response that should have come within hours, reportedly thanks to short-staffing and lack of training. Last autumn, newspapers were briefed that the current home secretary had finally lost patience with an institution she considered dysfunctional, misogynistic and tin-eared. The Met was, a Home Office source said, “like a horrible onion. You start peeling back [the layers] and you cry more and more.” There was talk of big reform plans. Yet so far, we have had a police, crime and sentencing bill handing yet more draconian powers to an institution Priti Patel herself supposedly considers dysfunctional, and briefings about how she wanted to ditch the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, last year but was overruled. That may be true, but public sniping undermines any authority Dick had left to drive change in her own force. Who will take hard truths from someone so politically friendless, knowing she might not be around that much longer? This is a dangerous moment for decent officers trying to do a good job in thankless circumstances, including female officers horrified by some male colleagues’ behaviour who may have felt forced (as one told the Charing Cross inquiry) to “play the game or stay quiet”. Given this government’s proven tendency to ignore constitutional niceties, it may also be a dangerous moment for the perennially delicate balance between police operational independence and political meddling. But reform needn’t mean overstepping that line. Patel could replicate the continuing inquiry into culture and standards in the Met across all forces, focusing on misogyny and racism in the ranks. She could insist the findings of police misconduct hearings aren’t swept under the carpet and overhaul recruitment and vetting, examining whether standards have slipped under the pressure to recruit. And she could ensure that whoever succeeds Dick is chosen for all the right reasons and then backed to get on with the job, rather than treated as a political football. Without substantive reforms, however, sooner or later May’s warning seems doomed to come true. Robert Peel’s famous dictum that the public are the police and the police are the public was a reminder of the symbiotic bond between the law-abiding majority and the officers to whom they willingly yield authority in return for protection. But that bond is visibly unravelling now. It’s in the interest of both sides to fix it before it snaps.

2/4/2022,"Though Uschi Gatward, who has died aged 49 of cancer, produced just a single collection of short stories, it proved to be a remarkably effective one. English Magic (2021) is a book with an atmosphere of its own, the whole greater than the sum of its parts. The first story, The Clinic, opens with a deceptively simple declaration: “It’s set up to look like a home, with sofas and a coffee table, but nobody’s fooled.” Immediately, the familiar becomes discomfiting. From there, the straightforward reality of taking a toddler to a clinic becomes a disturbing whirl of paranoia, state surveillance and societal disapproval. Soon the toddler’s family is fighting for survival – heading out for the wilderness after buying camping supplies in a shop where even the plastic mannequins are ominous.  Reviewers compared this dystopian nightmare to Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, but Uschi had a humour and an eye for detail of her own: “Cara’s dressed in her smartest clothes. I’m wearing my dumbest outfit, complete with slogan.” The apparently mundane could be imbued with significance. In other stories, a bird stuck in a chimney begins to feel like a terrible portent, a popped balloon takes on tragic weight. The ritual of a picnic was viewed with the same eye for the uncanny as that of a pagan ceremony, taking the reader into the depths beyond the page. “She invites us to trust our imaginations,” noted Lara Pawson in the Guardian. Uschi wrote about overlooked lives, seeing magic as a “resort of the dispossessed as much as the powerful, a rival to the established orthodoxy”. She thought of her work as protest fiction, detailing the experience of hard-up mothers, political prisoners, artists and political agitators. But while her characters were often on the precarious fringes of society, she did not romanticise or patronise them, because she was part of their world. Born in Mile End, in the East End of London, Uschi (Urszula) was the daughter of Francesca Ellul, who had migrated from Malta in 1954, and Michael, later Stefan, Gatward. They were clerical workers; after they separated when Uschi was six, and divorced the following year (1979), she was brought up by her mother. Her ability as a student was noticed early and she was given a fee-assisted place at Alleyn’s school, Dulwich, from which she went on to gain an English literature degree (1994) at King’s College, Cambridge. After graduating she worked in community theatre, writing, producing and directing her own plays including for New Wimbledon theatre and Charles Cryer theatre, Carshalton. But she made little headway, and one of the jobs she supported herself with was as a cleaner on the Heygate estate at Elephant and Castle in south-east London, where she had lived for part of her childhood. In 2002 Uschi completed an MA in creative writing at the University of Sussex, and took a job with Arts Council South East. As a trade union representative there she helped colleagues receive a decent redundancy package when the organisation was downsized following the crash of 2008. That year, too, she married the artist Matthew Krishanu and gave birth to her daughter, Pearl. She left Arts Council South East herself in 2010, and the family moved to a Live/Work council flat managed by Bow Arts Trust and Poplar HARCA housing association in the East End, in a scheme set up to benefit local residents through the arts. From this home, she and Matthew ran workshops and put on exhibitions. One of Matthew’s paintings featuring Uschi is in the Arts Council collection. Uschi was finally able to write about the world around her, and her stories began to be anthologised and published online. My Brother Is Back won the 2015 Wasafiri prize; Oh Whistle And was shortlisted for the 2016 White Review prize. They formed part of English Magic, and I got to know her through my publishing firm, Galley Beggar Press. The book’s first print run sold out within a month, its protest fiction being well and widely received. In the Daily Mail, Eithne Farry wrote of how in her “uneasy, excellent debut collection, the boundary between the earthly and the eerie is thin”. Uschi’s cancer diagnosis came in the same month, September 2021, as the book’s publication. She is survived by Matthew, Pearl and her mother.

2/4/2022,"This may destroy them, a cost of living explosion such as few have known in their lifetimes. The £350 of support for most households, announced today by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor amounts to only a fraction of the extra bills heading towards most households. It came on the day that the Bank of England raised interest rates, and on the day Shell boasted of a “momentous” 14-fold rise in its profits to £12bn. Labour’s promise of a windfall on soaring energy company profits never looked more prudent.  Expect people to understand all too well that these easements Sunak offers are nothing more than disguised loans. This “heat now, freeze later” debt will be clawed back from every future energy bill until 2027 – and prices may rise again. Labour’s Chris Bryant spelled out in parliament why £350 doesn’t “touch the sides” of the problem for his constituents in Rhondda: household costs are increasing by £2,875 a year, he said, in a constituency where the average wage is £27,000. How crafty to shift some of the payment of this temporary relief on to local authorities, through the rebate on council tax bills. Prof Tony Travers, of the London School of Economics, warns that as this is just a one-off, when council tax bills soar next year the blame is likely to fall on hard-pressed local authorities, not on Westminster. “Many councils will try to make more cuts to keep that rise down,” he tells me – but there is no more to cut. Just before the 2010 election, I first heard a soon-to-be Tory minister tell colleagues with glee they would “devolve the axe” to councils – and so they did, with local authorities bearing the brunt of austerity. In this week’s “levelling up” white paper, with its lyrical evocations of localism in Jericho and a hymn to the Medicis, Gove absurdly promised to “turbo-charge the whole of the country” on less than a shoestring. He said nothing of the last decade’s devastation of local libraries, swimming pools, bin collections and pothole repairs. Labour’s Lisa Nandy says levelling up would make up for just £1 for every £13 lost by councils since 2010. “We get a partial refund and they expect us to be grateful.” Everything about this energy policy is wrongheaded. The Social Market Foundation and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation want any subsidy delivered as cash directly into people’s pockets – £500 to all on low incomes on universal credit, which was an efficient way during the pandemic of paying out that £20 uplift (and then snatching it back). It’s greener and more dignified to give people money to spend as they choose, not forcing it on to their energy bills: with out-of-work benefits their lowest for 30 years, hard-pressed families may need to choose to spend less on energy and more on other necessities. I regularly keep in touch with the Big Help project in Merseyside’s Knowsley, one of the very poorest authorities in England, with seven food banks and 11 food clubs. Toni Bell, one of the managers, says already existing price rises are drawing in more full-time workers who have never asked for help, often needing debt advice as well as energy vouchers and food. Rock-solid Labour Knowsley has had no levelling up money to date, unlike many wealthy Tory seats, such as Sajid Javid’s Bromsgrove, which was given £15m. Here’s the question: are public attitudes changing towards the poorest in society, as British Social Attitudes has recently begun indicating? Nearly half of households on universal credit have suffered what’s politely called “food insecurity”. That means sometimes going hungry, as Marcus Rashford has described so movingly about his childhood. One in three children now live below the poverty line, according to the government’s own report, 700,000 more since 2012. That’s been a hard fact for most people to believe: one in three children you see in the street. Really? Just possibly, the price shocks this year, felt by almost everyone, will bring home to more voters how severe poverty is in Britain. Maybe the experience will put an end to brutal Benefits Street-style TV shows and imagery of feckless layabouts, with Middle England itself feeling the pinch. The reason so many children half starve, have no holidays or treats and lack the basics to share the same ordinary lives as schoolfriends is quite simple: not enough voters care enough about it. Could that be on the turn now? Might the Tories in their callousness find themselves on the wrong side of history, wrongfooted by a surge in public sympathy? I note a story from this week in the Bournemouth Echo: “Dorset MP questions food bank use as numbers rocket.” The local food bank reports a 43% rise in the number of clients. But Poole’s MP, Sir Robert Syms, said: “Well, I’m a bit surprised because at the moment unemployment continues to fall and the economy is continuing to grow and I can’t see any particular reason why [the number of food bank users] would pick up … I can’t see yet how energy bills would have made that much of an impact on people’s finances.” The news story went on: “Sir Robert added he would ‘have a word’ with the Department for Work and Pensions to see if there were more people applying for help.” Well, as MP for the millionaires of Sandbanks he may not know much about the DWP, and his Dorset is among the regions that have had the fewest cuts in the last decade, while Liverpool has had the most. There’s a lot of levelling up to be done, not least in hearts and minds and Tory attitudes.

2/4/2022,"The toppled statue of the Bristol slave trader Edward Colston should be displayed in a city museum – horizontally and still daubed with paint – and its former plinth topped with temporary artworks but sometimes left empty, an independent commission has concluded. After a citywide consultation, the We Are Bristol History Commission recommended the statue be preserved in the damaged state it was in when it was retrieved from the harbour after being pulled down and thrown into the dock. It has been exhibited at the city’s M Shed museum alongside information about the history of the enslavement of people of African descent.  The commission said the plinth in the city centre should act as a focal point for temporary pieces and activities that reflect important issues for Bristol, including the slave trade, and also at times be left empty to remind people of the statue’s fate. Prof Tim Cole, chair of the commission, said there were some irreverent suggestions from people about what should happen to the statue, toppled during a Black Lives Matter protest in June 2020. One claimed the city was so divided over it that it should be broken in two, with half put in the museum and the rest on the plinth. A second person suggested putting it back – but hauling it down and throwing it in the harbour once a year, a new “civic ritual”. But Cole said the city was more united than may have been expected, with 80% of Bristolians saying it should go on display. Of the one in five who did not want it exhibited, half of this group said it should go back on to the plinth and a quarter said it should be destroyed. The commission was pleased with how many young people took part in the survey, with four out of five Bristolian 18- to 34-year-olds saying they were very positive or positive about the toppling. About half of those aged 65 and above were either very negative or negative. The commissioners were surprised that black/African/Caribbean/black British residents were – by a slight margin – the least positive over the toppling. They dug into why, and the comments from people in this group suggested they did not like the fact that it could be considered an unlawful act. Men were less likely than women to feel positive about the fall of the statue, but there was no difference in attitudes in richer or poorer areas of the city. The commission’s suggested wording for a new plaque includes the phrase: “In the late 20th and early 21st century, the celebration of Colston was increasingly challenged, given his prominent role in the enslavement of African people.” Some may want more detail – he rose to become the equivalent of a modern chief executive in the Royal African Company, which shipped 84,000 Africans into slavery, including 12,000 children. Cleo Lake, a former lord mayor of Bristol who long campaigned to have the Colston statue removed, called for a permanent space in the city to tell the story of the transatlantic slave trade. She said: “We need a dedicated space in Bristol to tell the full history, that is accessible for as many people as possible, and empowers people of African descent.” The commission’s recommendations will be considered by the city’s mayor, Marvin Rees, and his cabinet in April. Katie Finnegan-Clarke, a co-founder of the Countering Colston campaign, said: “The commission’s report shows what we’ve always known: Bristolians have a strong, uniting belief in social justice, which means most people support the toppling of Colston’s statue. We hope Marvin will take this report as a green light to push for a permanent memorial for enslaved Africans in Bristol.” Last month four anti-racism campaigners responsible for toppling the statue were cleared of criminal damage by a jury in the city after their defence argued the monument was so indecent and potentially abusive that it constituted a crime.",News/UK news,"Damaged Colston statue should be displayed in museum, commission finds",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/03/damaged-colston-statue-should-be-displayed-in-museum-commission-finds
2/4/2022,"Rudolf Serkin ranks among the greatest of 20th-century pianists; his repertoire ranged from Bach to Reger, but Beethoven was always at its very heart. In a career of well over half a century, he made numerous recordings of the piano concertos, but only two studio sets of all five – with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra in the early 1950s, and another in Boston 30 years later, with Seiji Ozawa conducting the Boston Symphony. I heard Serkin live only a handful of times, all of them remarkable occasions, but those who were able to follow him more regularly always maintained that in the recording studio his playing seemed to lose some of the intensity that it conveyed so powerfully in concert. In the autumn of 1977, in the Herkulessaal in Munich, he played all five Beethoven concertos as well as the Choral Fantasy in a series of concerts with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra under Rafael Kubelík, another musician who, like Serkin, always put himself at the service of the music. Recordings of those performances were first released on disc in 2005, but in Britain at least they seem to have disappeared quickly from the catalogue; their reissue now makes available again what is in every respect a historic musical document.  Serkin was never interested in ingratiating himself through honeyed phrases or silken tone. Instead in these interpretations there is musical purpose and intellectual rigour in every detail. Whether it’s the almost combative muscularity he brings to the piano’s first entry in the third concerto, or the instant authority of his torrential opening to the Emperor, it sets the tone for all that follows, constantly drawing equally intense responses from Kubelík and his superb orchestra. The accounts of the slow movements are just as remarkable; there’s a hymn-like calm to the Largo of the third, a consoling sweetness to the fourth’s exchanges between the soloist and the orchestra. All are in short, remarkable performances, not only among the finest available on disc, but further reminders of just how peerless a Beethoven interpreter Serkin was. This week’s other picks There are new instalments this month in two continuing surveys of the Beethoven piano sonatas. On BIS, Andreas Haefliger groups together the three sonatas of Op 31, and plays them without any self-indulgence, but with a finely calculated combination of exuberant bravura and beautifully controlled introspection. For Hyperion, Angela Hewitt pairs the two mightiest of the late sonatas, Op 106 in B flat, the Hammerklavier, and Op 111, in C minor. She brings all her textural clarity to the fugal sections of the Hammerklavier, with no lack of weight in its great climaxes, even if the slow movement seems rather episodic at times, while Op 111 moves through its numinous final variations with total assurance.",Arts/Music,Beethoven: Piano Concertos and Choral Fantasy review – reissued reminder of a peerless pianist,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/beethoven-the-five-piano-concertos-etc-review-rudolf-serkin
2/4/2022,"The organist and composer Francis Jackson, who has died aged 104, began his career as a chorister under the distinguished organist of York Minster Edward Bairstow. Jackson was still active as both performer and composer 90 years later, having been organist himself at the minster for three and a half decades (1946–82). A virtuoso executant and prolific composer, he bestrode the world of English church music as a powerful if traditional force throughout the second half of the 20th century. His large output of Anglican sacred music included the frequently used Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis in G (“Me in G” as he liked to refer to the setting), hymn-tunes such as East Acklam, sung to the words of For the Fruits of His Creation at harvest time, and anthems. The six organ sonatas are the most substantial of his works in that genre, though there were many other pieces that both reflected his heritage of Bairstow, Herbert Howells and Edward Elgar, as well as his love of Ravel and admiration for Paul Hindemith and Max Reger. In addition to the church music he wrote a symphony, an organ concerto, chamber music, songs and a pair of monodramas with narrator. His compositional style was generally a conservative one, more modernistic neoclassical traits held in counterpoise with Romantic tendencies.  Not the least of his claims to fame was the bringing to worldwide prominence of the final Toccata of Widor’s Fifth Organ Symphony, which he recommended to the Duke and Duchess of Kent (then Katharine Worsley) as the outgoing music for their wedding at York Minster in 1961. This was on the basis that it was genuine organ music rather than a hackneyed arrangement of a piece written for a secular purpose. With that recommendation of a movement bristling with bravura fingerwork he was to set a challenge for generations of church organists to come. Among his many pupils was the Hollywood composer John Barry, creator of the scores for James Bond films. This was not his only connection to lighter music, however. During the second world war, as a member of the 9th Lancers armoured regiment serving in north Africa and Italy, he took up the saxophone, and became known for his “Jive with Jackson” and “Francis Jackson plays Boogie and Bach” sessions. For many years, his enthusiasm for dance bands remained a secret pleasure, for fear that it would be deemed incompatible with a career in church music. In later life, as a devotee of the BBC’s Big Band Special, he was inseparable from his radio on Monday nights. Born in Malton, north Yorkshire, he was the son of William Jackson, the local borough engineer and sanitary inspector, and Eveline May (nee Suddaby), a talented pianist. Both parents sang in the local church choir, as did Francis and his brother, Paul. Having auditioned for Bairstow at the minster, he was admitted to the full choir, serving only three weeks as a probationer. He was organist of Malton parish church from 1933 to 1940, continuing to study with Bairstow until the end pf that period. His war service was undistinguished: “I tried my best, but it wasn’t really what I was cut out for,” he recalled, “each side trying to blow the other to bits – and to what purpose?” It did, however, provide an opportunity for the broadening of his cultural horizons, his fellow troopers introducing him to the writings of Aldous Huxley, Christopher Isherwood and WH Auden. Returning to the minster after the war, he was appointed assistant organist, and on the death of Bairstow in 1946, took over as organist. In 1956 he gave his first recital on the new organ in the Royal Festival Hall, London, beginning with Bach’s D major Prelude and Fugue, BWV 532, which starts with a rapid D major scale played on the pedals alone. To open with this “dicey solo pedal scale” was a “brave (or foolhardy)” decision, he later noted. In 1957 he played Poulenc’s Organ Concerto under Basil Cameron at the Royal Albert Hall Proms, making further appearances in 1960 and 1964. He wrote a biography of his mentor, Blessed City, The Life and Works of Edward C Bairstow (1996), and recorded his complete organ works, an act of homage that may or may not have been appreciated by Bairstow, for whom the gramophone was anathema. Jackson also made four CDs of his own organ music. His Leeds-based peer Simon Lindley praised the “magical colouring, depth of expression and technical control” of his playing. In his later decades he was much in demand as a consultant on church organ design. For the instrument he advised on in Blackburn Cathedral he wrote his first organ sonata, playing it at one of the inaugural concerts. He remained active as both performer and composer after his retirement from the minster in 1982, when he was named organist emeritus. In the garden of the house in the Ryedale hamlet of Acklam that he shared with his wife, Priscilla (nee Procter), whom he married in 1950, stood an outhouse furnished with a grand piano, an antique horn gramophone and, taking pride of place, a splendid two-manual chamber organ with gleaming pipes relocated from a church in Derbyshire. For Lindley, the “bold lines, surprising corners and sense of wonder” that characterise Jackson’s liturgical music reflected features of his “glorious Acklam garden”. His love of French impressionist art, especially that of Corot, was similarly congruent with his life-long enthusiasm for Ravel and Debussy, and his espousal of the French school (notably César Franck, Widor, Louis Vierne and Marcel Dupré) in his recitals. His autobiography, Music for a Long While, was published in 2013. Priscilla died that year. He is survived by their children, Alice, William and Edward.

2/4/2022,"Judith Chester, who has died aged 83 from cancer, was a fiercely independent working woman and activist before feminism took centre stage. She was my wife from 1961 until our divorce in 1970 and for a second time from 2017 until her death. Born in the Oxfordshire village of Hook Norton, she was the daughter of Tom Williams, a farmer and pacifist, who became a conscientious objector during the second world war. Her mother, Mary (nee Sturdy), delivered most of the village babies as the district nurse. All the Williams children, Judith and her three siblings, were educated at a Quaker school nearby in Sibford.  On leaving Sibford school Judith rapidly climbed the hospitality ladder, becoming manageress of the Wimpy Bar in St Giles, Oxford, while still in her teens. Not long afterward, she met and married me, and we settled in London, where I was a journalist on the Sunday Times. We had two children – Saul and Cal. When we divorced we agreed child support, but Judith adamantly refused any maintenance for herself. Within a few months she emerged as one of the founder members of an organisation calling itself Gingerbread, which aimed to improve life for single parents mainly by developing local self-help groups. From a standing start, almost 400 such groups were established nationwide by 1980. Meantime, Judith combined child-rearing with a solid career in social work that would take her from her home in Brixton to local authority welfare offices all around the capital. Camden, Hammersmith, Lambeth and Lewisham were among the boroughs who employed her. Aside from one brief departure, working at the Royal Marsden cancer hospital, most of her effort was concentrated in foster care. Her empathy and wit were reckoned to be best deployed in this area, especially when homes for the most difficult teenagers were being sought. She also won prominence and respect for her pioneering advocacy of the benefits of same race foster placements. At the age of 59, she was appointed to a prestigious training post with the British Association for Adoption and Fostering (now CoramBAAF), but soon decided that she would rather be doing than teaching. On moving to Brighton she joined Families for Children, a large private agency, and clocked up another 15 years of close encounter fostering work, only faltering towards the end when our older son, Saul, died from cancer. Judith and I remarried in Brighton soon after Saul’s death but with our other son, Cal, living very close by. We remained by the seaside for four happily married years until the day she died. She is survived by me, Cal, our grandson, Izaac, and her three siblings, Pat, Sue and Tom.",News/Society,Judith Chester obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/03/judith-chester-obituary
2/4/2022,"While a number of people who have worked alongside Munira Mirza praise her intellect and character, it appeared paradoxical that having led No 10’s efforts in stoking culture war issues she has eventually resigned in protest over low politics. Mirza, who quit over Boris Johnson’s false claim that Keir Starmer held back attempts to prosecute Jimmy Savile, was the official behind Downing Street’s much criticised report into racial disparities, which downplayed structural factors.  She also defended earlier statements by Johnson, dismissing as “hysteria” the reaction to his 2018 newspaper column that likened Muslim women in burqas to letter boxes and bank robbers. What is certain is that her loss will be significant. Mirza worked with Johnson for 14 years, including his eight-year stint as London mayor. She began as an adviser on the arts and became his deputy mayor for education and culture. While largely associated in No 10 with culture war issues, as is her husband and fellow No 10 adviser, Dougie Smith, Mirza was seen as valued by Johnson because her views were not easily defined and could be unexpected, with the prime minister praising her as a “powerful nonsense detector”. In a 2020 profile of Mirza, Andrew Gimson, the prime minister’s biographer, said she and Johnson were both not easily pigeonholed by ideology. He said: “Of the two of them, she is the more rigorous and scientific, he more inclined to rely on instinct and intuition. But there is an affinity between them, especially as she also possesses, in the words of a senior minister, ‘a wonderful, waspish sense of humour which is attuned to the prime minister’s’.” Her political journey has certainly been a long one. Born in Oldham in 1978 to parents who came to the UK from Pakistan, she went to her local comprehensive school and Oldham sixth form college before studying English at Mansfield College, Oxford. Unlike Johnson, who was president of the Oxford Union and involved in Tory politics, Mirza was a student radical, becoming a member of the Revolutionary Communist party, contributing to its magazine Living Marxism. But she got frustrated at what she saw as the narrow-mindedness of the left, and embarked on the journey across the political spectrum that resulted in her being hired by Policy Exchange, the modernising Tory thinktank, and ultimately took her to Downing Street. One of her most-expressed views has been to contest the idea that challenges faced by black and minority ethnic people in the UK result from structural racism. In 2018, she accused the then universities minister, Sam Gyimah, of “a cynical game of hot potato” after he criticised Oxbridge for failing to admit more black students rather than investigating the deeper causes of the disparity. And she repeatedly criticised the Labour MP David Lammy’s report on the justice system, which was commissioned by Theresa May. Framing the issue in terms of institutional racism “only clouds the reality of what is happening and in the end could lead to worse outcomes for ethnic minorities”, Mirza claimed in an article for the contrarian website Spiked.",News/Politics,Munira Mirza: Boris Johnson’s ‘powerful nonsense detector’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/munira-mirza-boris-johnsons-powerful-nonsense-detector
