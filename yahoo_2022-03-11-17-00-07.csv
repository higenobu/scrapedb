3/11/2022,"A Ukrainian family seeking asylum from the war back home was turned away from the U.S. border in San Diego on Wednesday after attempting to reach family in California, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. A spokesperson from Customs and Border Protection told the Union-Tribune that the agency is ""looking into the situation."" ""I'm not asking for anything from the United States, just to be let in,"" the 34-old-mother, who requested she be identified as Sofiia, told the Union-Tribune. ""All we need is to be safe. All we want is to keep our lives safe."" She is accompanied by her three children ages 14, 12, and 6. Though the U.S. has offered ""temporary protected status"" to Ukrainians already in the states when Russia's invasion first began, the coverage does not apply to subsequent arrivals. That means ""any Ukrainians who manage to flee to the U.S. border will have to navigate the same restrictions that have sent other asylum seekers back to Mexico,"" the Union-Tribune writes, ""where thousands of asylum seekers have faced kidnappings, assaults and other violent attacks."" Sofiia said ""it was my luck"" that she left when she did. Her family still in Ukraine has told her they're running out of food, medicine, and gas. The family was reportedly denied entry when a relative, a U.S. citizen, came to pick them up, and again when Sofiia tried to request asylum through the pedestrian lane at San Ysidro Port of Entry. Even when immigration lawyers who overheard the situation got involved, nothing changed. ""We left our lives, our jobs, our families and houses in Ukraine just to escape from this horrible war,"" she said. ""All my friends and family are far, far away from me, and I don't know if they will be alive tomorrow. I just want to keep my kids' lives safe.""

3/11/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - Confiscating the assets of companies that have fled Russia after the invasion of Ukraine would shatter investor confidence for decades and take Russia back to the calamitous days of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, metals magnate Vladimir Potanin said. Potanin, the biggest shareholder in Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of palladium and refined nickel, said Russia should respond with pragmatism to its exclusion from whole swathes of the global economy. ""We should not try to 'slam the door' but endeavour to preserve Russia's economic position in those markets which we spent so long cultivating,"" Potanin, the 61-year-old president of Norilsk Nickel, said on the Telegram messaging app. Potanin said confiscating assets from companies which had left Russia would put the country out in the cold for investors for decades. ""It would take us back 100 years to 1917 and the consequences - a global lack of confidence in Russia from investors - we would feel for many decades,"" Potanin said. Russia's economy is facing the gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after the West imposed heavy sanctions on almost the entire Russian financial and corporate system following Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin told President Vladimir Putin on Thursday that the government proposed putting companies that had left Russia into external administration. The exact mechanisms of that are unclear, though there is a fierce debate within the Russian elite about how severe Moscow reaction to Western sanctions should be, officials and businessmen said. Putin said Russia would remain open for business and did not intend to close itself off from those who still wanted to do business. Many do not - at least for now. BP said last month it was abandoning its stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft while companies ranging from McDonald's and Coca-Cola Co to Toyota and IKEA have shuttered their businesses in Russia. DOOR SLAM? Potanin’s upbringing as the son of a high-ranking Soviet trade official and an education at Moscow’s elite diplomatic academy have always set him slightly apart from other oligarchs who rose from rags to riches in the chaos of the 1990s. The privatisation deals under President Boris Yeltsin gave Potanin and other oligarchs control over some of the best assets of a former superpower, though their clout was eroded under Putin as a new group of former spies put some of Russia's biggest oil production units under state control. Besides being the world's largest producer of palladium and high-grade nickel, MMC Norilsk Nickel is a major producer of platinum and copper. It also produces cobalt, rhodium, silver, gold, iridium, ruthenium, selenium, tellurium and sulphur. Potanin warned that some countries used sanctions as a way to edge out competition so Moscow needed to make wise and thoughtful decisions. He also called for removing foreign currency restrictions on paying coupons on Russia's external debt which he said totalled $480 billion because a technical default on interest payments could, he said, allow demands for the full principal to be paid. ""This fully applies to major public companies,"" Potanin said. Russia said on Sunday that sovereign bond payments will depend on sanctions. ""We see that the West's own economies have suffered by imposing sanctions against Russia. So we must be wiser and avoid a scenario under which our sanctions hit us,"" Potanin said. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is essential to ensure Russian security after the United States enlarged the membership of NATO up to Russia's borders and supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence while the United States, and its European and Asian allies have condemned the Russian invasion. China has called for calm.

3/11/2022,"By Josh Smith SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea will launch a number of reconnaissance satellites in coming years to provide real-time information on military actions by the United States and its allies, state media on Thursday reported leader Kim Jong Un as saying. While inspecting North Korea's National Aerospace Development Administration, Kim said ""a lot"" of military reconnaissance satellites would be put into sun-synchronous polar orbit in the period of a five-year plan announced last year, state news agency KCNA reported. ""He noted that the purpose of developing and operating the military reconnaissance satellite is to provide the armed forces of the DPRK with real-time information on military actions against it by the aggression troops of the U.S. imperialism and its vassal forces in south Korea, Japan and the Pacific,"" the news agency said. North Korea appears to be preparing to launch a reconnaissance satellite, which could prove as controversial as the nuclear-armed country's weapons tests because they use the same banned ballistic missile technology, experts say. North Korea says it conducted two tests of satellite systems on Feb. 27 and March 5. Authorities in South Korea, Japan, and the United States says the tests involved launches of ballistic missiles. The launches drew international condemnation and the U.S. military said on Thursday it had increased surveillance and reconnaissance collection in the Yellow Sea. The United States also said it had heightened its ballistic missile defence readiness after a ""significant increase"" in North Korean missile tests. Kim defended the satellite work as not only about gathering information but protecting North Korea's sovereignty and national interests, exercising its legitimate rights to self-defence, and elevating national prestige, KCNA reported. ""He stressed that this urgent project for perfecting the country's war preparedness capacity by improving our state's war deterrent is the supreme revolutionary task, a political and military priority task to which our Party and government attach the most importance,"" KCNA said. The United States and its allies have condemned previous North Korean space launches as violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions that have imposed sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programmes. 'MILITARY SIGNIFICANCE' North Korea has not tested a nuclear weapon or its long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) since 2017, but has suggested in could resume such tests because talks with the United States are stalled. Its latest flurry of missile launches could be groundwork for a return to ICBM and nuclear bomb tests this year, the U.S. Directorate of National Intelligence (DNI) said in its annual Worldwide Threat Assessment released this week. A satellite launched into orbit would be the first since 2016. Recent sub-orbital launches, which likely used road-mobile medium-range ballistic missiles, appeared designed to ""pop the key components of an imagery reconnaissance satellite up to operational altitudes for a few minutes of testing"", 38 North, a U.S.-based monitoring group, said in a report. Such components, including satellite stabilisation, the imaging payload, and data transmission may have failed in previous tests and therefore required additional testing, the group said. ""It remains to be seen how capable any North Korean imagery satellite would be, the frequency of launches, or how many such satellites might be maintained in orbit at any one time—all key indicators of the actual military significance of such satellites,"" 38 North said. Regardless, North Korea clearly sees this capability as having propaganda value and showcasing its technological prowess and effective leadership, it added. A launch could make technical contributions to North Korea’s ICBM capability, depending on what type of rocket booster is used, 38 North said. ""It may also be the precursor to other more provocative developments mentioned by Kim, such as the testing of multiple-warhead missiles, solid-propellant ICBMs, and ICBM-range solid-propellant submarine-launched ballistic missiles,"" it said.
