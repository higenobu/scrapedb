5/20/2022,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A deputy in South Carolina whose police van was swept away by floodwaters in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, drowning two women seeking mental health treatment trapped in a cage in the back was sentenced Thursday to 18 years in prison. A Marion County jury found former Horry County deputy Stephen Flood guilty of two counts of involuntary manslaughter and two counts of reckless homicide. Judges ordered Wendy Newton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, to be involuntarily committed the day they died, but their families said they were not violent. Newton was only seeking medicine for her fear and anxiety and Green’s family said she was committed to a mental facility at a regular mental health appointment by a counselor she had never seen before. Flood, 70 was sentenced about 30 minutes after the verdict and after several relatives of the women said his decision to press forward with the shortest route left an impossible-to-fix hole in their lives. “This was a deliberate act set in motion by a pompous, stubborn man,” Green's sister Donnela Green-Johnson told the judge. “He abused the trust my sister, Nikki, Wendy and the state of South Carolina entrusted him with. And for what? To save time.” Circuit Court Judge William Seales sentenced Flood to five years in prison on each involuntary manslaughter charge and four years on each reckless homicide charge and ordered the sentences served back-to-back. The floodwaters swept the police van off its wheels and pinned it against a guardrail, preventing the women from being able to get out the sliding door they used to enter the van. Flood and a deputy with him did not have a key to a second door and there was no emergency escape hatch, according to testimony from the trial streamed by WMBF-TV. The deputies said they spoke to the women and tried to keep them calm for about an hour as the water kept rising before it got too dangerous and rescuers could no longer hear them. “How awful must that have been to sit there and wait for your own death?” Solicitor Ed Clements said in his closing argument Thursday. While other factors like an emergency radio that failed to notify rescuers of the van's exact location contributed to the deaths, Clements said the drownings all came out of Flood’s reckless decision to drive 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) through water. National guard troops put up barricades on U.S. Highway 76 just outside Nichols, but Flood drove around them after briefly talking to the soldiers. Clements read from Flood's statement to investigators that he felt like once he was in the water, he could not turn around because he could no longer see the edge of the highway and was worried about running into a ditch hidden by the water. “Maybe it wounded his pride or stubbornness. I don’t know. He pushed forward into water that was not just standing in a tall puddle, but it was rushing, crossing the guardrail. All of it was the Little Pee Dee River by then,” Clements said. Flood's lawyer said while it was a terrible tragedy, others were trying to unfairly blame just the former deputy instead of the equipment problems, the troops that waived them around the barricades and supervisors who knew dangerous flooding was starting and sent him even though taking the women to the mental health facilities was not an emergency. ""I ask that you resist the urge to try to give justice to those two ladies by giving injustice to this good man,"" defense attorney Jarrett Bouchette said. “They want to make him a scapegoat for this accident.” Flood did not testify, but before he was sentenced told the judge he tried everything he could to keep the women calm as the waters rose and help was slow to arrive. “It was a series of mistakes on my part and other people that led me to that point and I’m sorry for what happened to the girls,” Flood said. Flood and the deputy with him, Joshua Bishop, were eventually rescued from the top of the transport van, authorities said. Bishop will stand trial for two counts of involuntary manslaughter at a later date. They tried to shoot the locks off the second door, but it still would not open. The delay in getting help was costly too. A firefighter testified they were able to cut the roof off the van and started working on the cage, but the water got higher and faster and it was too dangerous to continue. Newton's son Charles said he hated that Flood had to learn to follow the rules and use common sense at such a steep price. “I can forgive, but I cannot forget. Fortunately, I still remember my mom as a happy woman, a joyful woman who loved her family,"" he said. “But you, Mr. Flood, will remember my mom by hearing her screams in the back of that van."" ___ Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP.",U.S./Associated Press,Ex-deputy gets 18 years after detainees drown in locked van,https://news.yahoo.com/ex-deputy-gets-18-years-202543628.html
5/20/2022,"Former President Donald Trump's endorsement record is being tested in midterm primaries. So far, Trump endorsed candidates in competitive races have received 63.5% of the vote on average. Several high-profile Trump picks have either lost or underperformed. Mehmet Oz's fate remains unknown. Former President Donald Trump's endorsement record has held up relatively strong so far in the 2022 midterms. Factoring out Trump picks who ran unopposed, his endorsements receive an average of 63.5% of the vote across federal, state, and local primary contests. But several of Trump's most controversial or troubled selections have either underperformed or lost their Republican primaries altogether, as GOP voters have shown a willingness to ignore the former president's wishes, according to an Insider analysis of Trump endorsees and election results. It's an indication that the value of Trump's ""golden ticket"" is limited — and certainly no guarantee of salvation for a flawed candidate that's lost the trust of Republican voters otherwise predisposed to supporting the former president's hand-picked hopefuls. Exhibit A: Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his North Carolina District 11 congressional race amid numerous scandals. Trump's plea to voters — ""Let's give Madison a second chance!"" — couldn't save the freshman congressman. Trump's endorsement also failed to rescue endorsee Charles Herbster, who faced accusations he groped women, from a Republican primary crash-and-burn in Nebraska's gubernatorial contest. Trump's favored candidate in Idaho's gubernatorial race, Janice McGeachin, earned just 32% percent of her Republican primary vote and lost. She had recently delivered a recorded speech at a White nationalist convention and cozied up to armed right-wing militia members. Five other Trump-backed candidates, including legally imperiled Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, failed to win their Republican primaries outright and face runoffs.   While endorsements are an imperfect measure of Trump's influence in the present iteration of the GOP — with many of the candidates in these races running as the Trumpiest version of themselves, even after failing to clinch a Trump endorsement — they also provide a barometer for what an over-performance or under-performance looks like. In Ohio, Republican Senate nominee and Trump endorsee JD Vance won his race with just 32% of the vote. Rivals who tried to question Vance's MAGA credentials and present themselves as bigger Trump loyalists, such as Ohio state Treasurer Josh Mandel — whose name Trump mangled with Vance's as ""JP Mandel"" — were able to split the vote. Mandel and Ohio Assistant Attorney General Matt Dolan both received 23% of the vote, bringing Vance far below the average performance for a Trump blue chip candidate. In Pennsylvania, results have yet to be finalized in the GOP Senate primary, but the returns so far indicate that a similar underperformance unfolded. Mehmet Oz, the celebrity TV cardiothoracic surgeon and Trump's selection in the race, is neck-and-neck with former hedge fund CEO David McCormick. Both candidates held a shade above 31% of the vote with 98% of returns in by late Thursday morning. Five other candidates — most notably surging Kathy Barnette — combined to account for more than 37% of the vote. Although Oz's name recognition is significantly higher than that of McCormick, Oz faced criticism for carpetbagging — he is a longtime New Jersey resident who just recently established residency in Pennsylvania — and political inexperience. ""If he wins, it will be to a great extent because of the Trump endorsement,"" longtime Pennsylvania pollster G. Terry Madonna told Insider. ""If McCormick wins, I think it's because of his ads which talked about and projected his Pennsylvania roots,"" Madonna, the co-founder of the Franklin & Marshall College poll, added. As Insider previously reported from Trump's rally for Oz in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, the MAGA faithful were far from sold on Oz and gravitated toward Kathy Barnette as an alternative. ""I just want somebody from Pennsylvania, someone who actually grew up here,"" Lynn Johnson, a 55-year-old restaurant server from Ligonier, Pennsylvania, told Insider. Johnson said she was hung up on Oz's New Jersey residency, first reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""And Oprah,"" Johnson mentioned as another red flag. ""He was with Oprah."" Johnson and other Oz skeptics at the rally tended to avoid blaming Trump for the pick, instead saying he has been getting bad advice. Others saw the endorsement as not their cup of tea, but more general election focused move. ""He's not a stupid guy, he's doing what he has to do to get the votes and get the folks in to actually make the change,"" Tom McCandless of Philadelphia told Insider at the rally, referring to Trump. ""Because [Oz has] been on TV so much ... he'll get the stay-at-home moms,"" McCandless added. Across Tuesday night's primaries — excluding the to-be-determined Oz result in Pennsylvania — Trump's picks won 23 races and only lost three, one of them being Cawthorn. Despite being out of office and having cost Republicans the White House, Senate and House, Trump's endorsement tends to come with strong support up and down the ballot. But Trump also pads his endorsement record by throwing his backing behind hopefuls who face little to no opposition. Some Republicans have also taken notice when Trump issues a last-minute endorsement as in the case of Doug Mastriano, now Pennsylvania's Republican gubernatorial nominee, for whom Trump announced his support on the weekend before the election. ""There's no question that there's some influence there, but it's also pretty clear that he's pretty worried about the perception of his influence,"" Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, whose seat Oz is running for, told Insider. ""He endorses Doug Mastriano on the weekend before the election after it had become obvious to everyone that Mastriano was going to win. He does that so he can take credit for the win that was going to happen anyway."" However, high-profile underperformers such as Oz and Vance show there is still a demand for alternatives in some races, and those alternatives are often presenting themselves as more Trumpy than the former president's pick. As for ""JP Mandel,"" were he a real, singular candidate, he would have gotten 56% of the vote in the Ohio primary, 7.5 percentage points off the average performance for a Trump endorsee in a competitive race.

5/20/2022,"PEKIN, Ill. (AP) — An Illinois man faces up to three years in prison after being convicted of illegally giving his son an assault-style rifle he later used to shoot and kill four people in 2018 at a Waffle House in Tennessee. A judge convicted Jeffrey Reinking last week of illegal delivery of a firearm to a person who had been treated for mental illness within the past five years, the ( Peoria) Journal Star reported. He remains free on bond pending his sentencing, which is set for June 17. During Reinking's May 13 bench trial, Tazewell County prosecutors argued that the rural Morton, Illinois, man knew his son, Travis Reinking, had undergone mental health treatment in 2016. In May 2016, police and fire personnel responded to a pharmacy parking lot in Morton where Travis Reinking told officers he believed singer Taylor Swift was stalking him and had hacked into his cellphone. Reports the Journal Star obtained in 2018 showed Travis Reinking was brought to a Peoria hospital for an evaluation after that incident and had agreed to go to the hospital. Waffle House shooter Travis Reinking is now serving life in prison without parole for four murders. But Jeffrey Reinking’s attorney, Kevin Sullivan, argued at trial that his client didn’t know his son had been treated for mental health issues at the hospital. Sullivan said he knew his son was brought to the hospital but didn’t know why, and was not guilty of the charge. Because the younger Reinking had his firearm owner’s identification card revoked by Illinois State Police, he could not legally have guns within the state. Travis Reinking surrendered his guns to his father, who later returned them to him at some point before the fatal shooting at a Waffle House in Nashville, prosecutors said. The assault-style rifle he used in that attack, an AR-15, was one of the guns his father had returned to him. Travis Reinking was sentenced in February to life in prison without the possibility of parole after being convicted of four counts of first-degree murder and other charges. He opened fire inside the restaurant on April 22, 2018, killing Taurean Sanderlin, 29; Joey Perez, 20; Akilah Dasilva, 23; and DeEbony Groves, 21. Evidence at Travis Reinking's trial showed he had schizophrenia and suffered delusions for years, believing unknown people were tormenting him. He contacted law enforcement several times to report that he was being threatened, stalked and harassed. In July 2017, he was detained by the Secret Service after he ventured unarmed into a restricted area on the White House grounds and demanded to meet with then-President Donald Trump.",U.S./Associated Press,Illinois man convicted of giving son rifle he used to kill 4,https://news.yahoo.com/illinois-man-convicted-giving-son-172401976.html
