1/11/2022,"The nation’s peak body for general practitioners has demanded the government “urgently repair” the children’s vaccine rollout, saying supply and delivery issues have left doctors working with “one arm tied behind their back”. Disability groups, meanwhile,say the failure to prioritise children with a disability, coupled with the current surge in demand, has created significant barriers for those most vulnerable to Covid-19.  The Pharmacy Guild of Australia is also reporting that very high demand is putting “pressure on supplies” for its members and that “some pharmacies have reported deliveries being less than they ordered, or deliveries being delayed”. The rollout of the new paediatric Pfizer formula to 2.3 million children aged 5-11 began on Monday, amid frustrations from GPs about low dose allocations and notifications of delivery delays. The federal government has insisted there are no supply or delivery issues, saying there is enough vaccine in Australia to ensure “every child who wants to be vaccinated can be vaccinated”. But Dr Karen Price, president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, told Guardian Australia on Tuesday she “can’t imagine” how children would receive their first dose before the school year began at the current pace. She said GPs could not obtain enough stock to meet demand and had had orders cancelled at the last minute. “Some practices have been allocated 50 or 100 doses a week when they have around 1,500 children on their books. It’s not hard to do the math and see we can’t keep up with demand,” Price said. “I have spoken with the health minister this morning to inform him of the challenges facing general practices. I was told any issues will be dealt with accordingly, and that GPs have already delivered 64% of the available childhood vaccinations yesterday.” The dose allocations have been particularly frustrating for families of children with a disability, often most at risk from Covid, who have not been prioritised, unlike the staged rollout of the adult jab last year. Children and Young People with Disability Australia chief executive Mary Sayers said she had repeatedly urged the government to put children with a disability at the “front of the queue” for receiving the vaccine. “We’ve heard really loud and clear from parents that they’re getting pretty frustrated with the hurdles in place when it comes to booking a vaccine for children, particularly for children with a disability,” Sayers told the Guardian. “There are a whole lot of challenges around GPs and pharmacists having supplies, so that they’re not being able to book an appointment.” Sayers is also frustrated by the lack of data on the vaccination of children with a disability, and met with the health department to lobby for an improved and streamlined process on Tuesday. “We’re entering our third year of this pandemic, yet it still doesn’t seem to be getting through that people with a disability need a really targeted and nuanced approach,” she said. “It’s not because they have a disability, it’s because they face additional barriers in our society for inclusion in vaccination programs.” The Pharmacy Guild of Australia also warned of significant strain on its members, brought by the children’s rollout and the cut of the minimum booster interval for adults from five months to four. “There has been very high demand for 5-11[-year-old] vaccinations since the program began this week,” national president, Prof Trent Twomey, told the Guardian. “This has put pressure on supplies and some pharmacies have reported deliveries being less than they order, or deliveries being delayed.” Supply is not the only issue facing the children’s vaccine rollout. The Guardian revealed last week that a “technical glitch” erroneously listed two vaccine hubs in New South Wales as available for children’s vaccinations on the state government’s vaccine booking website. The error was only discovered in the days before the children’s vaccine rollout commenced, causing last-minute mass cancellations for parents. Meanwhile, Price says reports have also emerged of shipments arriving with expired doses. The rollout involves roughly 8,000 providers, including 6,000 GPs and 2,000 pharmacies, and additional state and Commonwealth clinics and Indigenous health clinics. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On Sunday, the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said: “The fact that there are over 8,000 points of presence for children’s vaccination is designed to mean that there are multiple options over the course of the coming week. “And with 3m vaccines for 2.3 million, it’s enough to ensure that every child has the opportunity to be vaccinated. “Every child that wants to be vaccinated can be vaccinated, but the critical message is for people to look around and bookings are opening every day. So health.gov.au is the starting place [for] the eligibility checker, but also the states as well.” Hunt’s office was approached for further comment.",News/Australia news,"Supply and delivery issues stalling Covid vaccine rollout for children 5-11, Australian GPs say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/11/supply-and-delivery-issues-stalling-covid-vaccine-rollout-for-children-5-11-australian-gps-say
1/11/2022,"Tech platforms are being urged to make it easier for fake reviews to be removed amid fears they are harming small businesses online. Small business ombudsman Bruce Billson told a parliament committee that the online harms experienced by small businesses through fake reviews must be considered as part of the government’s social media inquiry.  “Our office is particularly concerned by the posting of negative reviews that are not founded in real customer experiences (‘fake reviews’),” he said in a submission in the last week of December 2021. “These reviews damage business reputations and cause significant distress to staff and business owners,” he said. “Our office has assisted more than 30 businesses dealing with fake reviews in recent years.” Guardian Australia has previously reported how little recourse businesses can have when disgruntled customers, and even competitors, leave negative reviews on businesses on Google search and maps. Increasingly, businesses are launching defamation suits against Google in order to unmask anonymous reviewers to get them to remove the review. Last year, the county court of Victoria ordered a woman who left multiple negative Google reviews about Kew periodontist Dr Allison Dean to pay $170,000 in damages plus costs, for what the judge said was a “vendetta” against the specialist. In 2020, Google and Optus handed over information that revealed the identity of an anonymous negative reviewer on Melbourne dentist Dr Matthew Kabbabe’s page, after he took legal action. The case was subsequently settled. Billson said fake reviews are often given prominence on online platforms, and could contribute to a loss of sales over an extended period of time. “Further, as a small business owner’s identity is often intrinsically linked to their business, fake reviews contribute to mental health strains,” he said. Citing a Google move last year to remove fake one-star reviews for the Robinhood app during the peak of the GameStop share incident one year ago, Billson said such protection should also be offered to small businesses. “We recommend that digital platforms build out tools that prevent fake reviews as well as create a more accessible and transparent review system,” he said. “This should include giving small businesses more transparency on the evidence they need to provide a digital platform to have a fake review reviewed and removed,” he said. In the 2019 digital platforms report, released by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, it was recommended the government develop an external dispute resolutions scheme for issues with tech companies such as Google and Facebook. The government agreed to the recommendation, and flagged a trial of the scheme in 2020. However, to date there has been no pilot scheme. Billson said in his submission his office would be happy to provide insight “into the most effective management of small business disputes”. The social media inquiry was set up late last year to review “the range of online harms that may be faced by Australians on social media and other online platforms, including harmful content or harmful conduct”, the impact algorithms have, identity verification and age verification policies, online safety for children, and data collection. Palmer United Party MP Craig Kelly, who was permanently banned from Facebook and Instagram in April last year over posts promoting hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and questioning the effectiveness of masks, is one of the members of the committee. The committee held two hearings just before Christmas, and submissions to the inquiry close on Wednesday.",News/Australia news,Tech platforms urged to make it easier for small businesses to have ‘damaging’ online fake reviews removed,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/11/tech-platforms-urged-to-make-it-easier-for-small-businesses-to-have-damaging-online-fake-reviews-removed
1/11/2022,"The US was battered by 20 separate billion-dollar climate and weather disasters in 2021, one of the most catastrophic climate years on record which led to at least 688 deaths, according to the annual report of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Damage from the year’s 20 most costly disasters, which included thousands of wildfires burning across western states, frigid temperatures and hail storms in Texas, tornadoes in the south-east, and tropical storms saturating the east coast, totaled around $145bn.  This makes 2021 the third costliest extreme weather year on record, with four tropical storms – Elsa, Fred, Ida and Nicholas – accounting for just over half the total price tag. The deadly mega-disasters were scattered throughout 2021 and hit communities from coast to coast, starting with flash floods and bomb cyclones in California and ending with Colorado’s most destructive ever wildfire, which tore through almost 1,100 homes and 6,000 acres (2,400 hectares), causing more than $10bn of damage. Between 44% and 56% of the country was affected by drought during the course of 2021. Overall, the US saw its fourth-hottest year on record fueled by historic highs in December (beating 2015) that produced spring-like temperatures on parts of the east coast. Ten states – Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas – also had their warmest December on record. Across the country, people of color and low-income communities are being disproportionately affected by the toll and trauma of extreme weather events, which in many cases are directly attributed to global heating caused by greenhouse gas emissions. NOAA’s report comes as Joe Biden attempts to resuscitate his Build Back Better bill which includes the country’s largest ever climate investment and without which experts say the US has no chance of meeting its pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions to at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030. Fossil-fuel friendly senator Joe Manchin’s opposition to the $1.75tn economic recovery and social welfare bill is holding up its passage through the senate. Failure to take radical action to curtail greenhouse gases will likely take its toll on a growing number of Americans as the costs – human and economic – of extreme weather and climate disasters are already escalating. “The data highlights a worsening and undeniable trend that underscores the reality of how the climate crisis is already affecting every region of the country,” said Rachel Cleetus, policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). “We simply cannot adapt to runaway climate change … Fossil fuel companies and their allies shouldn’t be allowed to stand in the way of desperately needed climate action.” Disaster tracking by NOAA shows that the average number of annual billion-dollar events over the past five years was 17.2 compared with just 5.3 during the 1990s. The staggering costs from the mega-disasters between 2017 and 2021 totaled almost $750bn. Climate change has outpaced building regulations which have played a significant role in the rising number and cost of mega-disasters, according to Adam Smith, an applied climatologist at NOAA. “Much of the growth has taken place in vulnerable areas like coasts, river floodplains and the wild land urban interface. Vulnerability is especially high where building codes are insufficient for reducing damage from extreme events,” Smith said. While the growing intensity and frequency of weather and climate disasters like extreme rainfall, extreme heat, and drought are directly attributed to global heating, the links to tornadoes are still not fully understood Still, 2021 was a very active tornado year with a record-shattering 193 in December – nearly double the previous high of 97 in 2002. Another historic event was the mid-February freeze in Texas which left more than 200 dead and thousands without power and running water. Damages are estimated at $24bn, costing more than double the so-called storm of the century which stretched Canada to Honduras in March 1993.",News/Environment,"US hit by 20 separate billion-dollar climate disasters in 2021, NOAA report says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/11/us-hit-by-20-separate-billion-dollar-climate-disasters-in-2021-noaa-report-says
1/11/2022,"Queensland health authorities have condemned reports of “pox parties” held by groups of unvaccinated residents on the Gold Coast, which has quickly become the epicentre of the state’s Omicron outbreak. On Monday another 23 people – enough to fill a separate ward – were admitted to hospital on the Gold Coast after contracting Covid-19. Half of intensive care patients in the region were unvaccinated.  Reports of gatherings where people deliberately attempted to spread the virus, in the belief it would increase their immunity, were first reported by the Gold Coast Bulletin. The Queensland chief health officer, John Gerrard, said the notion was “utterly ridiculous”. “The best way to get immunity to this virus is through vaccination, not through these parties. “Please, please stop.” Queensland reported 20,566 new cases on Tuesday, though the total included some tests from private pathologists that would have otherwise been included in Monday’s numbers. A software issue that delayed the reporting of case numbers had since been rectified. There were now 109,524 active cases in Queensland – 502 patients were in hospital, 27 in ICU, and six on ventilators. One in four hospitalised patients were on the Gold Coast – where vaccination rates were marginally lower than the rest of Queensland. Six of the 11 patients in ICU on the Gold Coast were unvaccinated. “Gold Coast remains a hotspot, they had an additional 23 admissions to their wards yesterday … a typical hospital ward is somewhere between 20 to 30 patients,” Gerrard said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I think the principal reason (for the Gold Coast outbreak) is the number of people travelling there from interstate. “You’ve had a lot of incursions and a lot of spot fires … just because their test was negative when they crossed over, they then became positive after they arrived. “The slightly lower vaccination rate … it’s not terrible on the Gold Coast … that contributes and also we have heard from the police repeatedly that mask wearing is poorer there.” Parts of the Gold Coast share some similarities with alternative lifestyle communities just across the border in northern New South Wales where vaccination rates are low. There also have been significant anti-lockdown protests in the city. As concern about the Gold Coast outbreak mounts, the city’s mayor, Tom Tate, has called for state health authorities to “let it rip”. In an opinion piece, published by the Gold Coast Bulletin on Monday, Tate said constant rule changes had tested the goodwill of the community. “Opening the border was always going to see Omicron sweep across the state,” Tate said. “The state claims it is all about slowing the spread. Why not let it spread rapidly so we reach the peak sooner, and our economy gets off life support faster?” Gerrard, who was not asked directly about Tate’s comments, made clear hospitals had plans in place to deal with the coming peak, expected in early February. Health workers were being called back from holidays to help the hospital system cope.

1/11/2022,"The controversy surrounding the entry to Australia of Novak Djokovic for the Australian Open has been strange and wild. Since the Covid pandemic landed, Australia has positioned itself most extremely as a global outlier on border control.  This has taken us to stranger legal places than most; stranger even than the migration law mashups that Tampa and 9/11 delivered some 20 years ago. What kind of democracy bans its own citizens from departing without specific approval by border control bureaucrats, never mind returning? One human cost has been families, lovers and friends split across internal borders that nobody had much considered since we became a federation, instead of a cluster of British colonies, well over a century ago. And Australians have become strangely hardened to stories about so many people across our diaspora similarly forbidden to reunite, stranded everywhere from Bangladesh to Brussels and Beijing. I thought we’d hit a new nadir in October when a Covid-positive man from New South Wales escaped quarantine detention in then Covid-zero Tasmania. Most of my home state was sent into snap lockdown, and a song went viral on social media calling for the offender’s lynching and anal rape. Many perversely enjoyed that spectacle – and political leaders didn’t hose down the hysteria. The Djokovic case ratcheted these unhealthy dynamics to the next level. The Belgrade factor didn’t help – my inbox filled with hate speech I haven’t seen directed against any people from the former Yugoslavia since the 1990s Balkan wars. Should I spell out that Djokovic is as beloved to most Serbs as Ash Barty is to most Australians – connected with pride in celebrating the best side of our complex national identity and healing some painful history? No point, I pressed delete. Waves of anti-Novak abuse stormed ahead, including smart-arse memes that made our Tassie jingle look gentle. All clearly fuelled by Australian frustrations caused by almost two years of on/off/on again lockdowns, terrible anxiety about the current Covid spread and lack of testing access, and no real idea about what will happen next for health support, food supplies and income security. Because Djokovic – like no small number of elite athletes internationally – refuses to consent to vaccination against Covid, he fast became the whipping boy for all of it. My love of tennis is only eclipsed by my fandom for the rule of law. Which doesn’t mean flinging around slogans like “rules are rules” then doing whatever plays to people’s basest instincts, politically and polemically. Within our nation and distinctive federation, the rule of law has been one of Australia’s better cultural assets, which is why so many people have emigrated here. I’m profoundly opposed to the way Australian governments since Tampa and 9/11 have demonised people legitimately seeking asylum, and locked them up in inhumane conditions – including the Park hotel in Melbourne, where Djokovic was detained, along with the Czech tennis player Renata Voracova, whose visa was also cancelled after the fact, and who left Australia on Saturday. I had quiet if anxious hopes that the federal court would step up in this profoundly important test case, which engages much bigger questions for Australians – including around the power dynamics between our executive and the judiciary – than anything about Djokovic and his plight. I wasn’t disappointed, despite the unforeseen difficulty of accessing the court’s livestreamed proceedings – mainly now available on YouTube, and way more interesting than Netflix. The mix of migration and administrative law in question – plus the “wriggly fish” of estoppel – is exceedingly complex, in a way few laypeople will appreciate, and that even most lawyers will struggle to understand. The unsensational and impressive spectacle of Judge Anthony Kelly in dialogue with counsel was calm, clear and mutually respectful. I certainly welcomed the judge’s release order, which was based on the legally “unreasonable” treatment of Djokovic by Australian Border Force officials in the early hours of Serbian Christmas Eve, last Thursday. The power ball has now passed to Australia’s immigration minister, who lawfully can cancel Djokovic’s legitimatised visa. If he does – in the lead-up to a pivotal Australian election, where spin doctors may have assumed that playing an anti-Serb, anti-elite and aggressively denialist card amid this government’s failures to contain Covid would be an easy point to score – Djokovic will be best out of Australia.
