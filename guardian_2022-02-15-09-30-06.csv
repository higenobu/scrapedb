2/15/2022,"Stonehenge is a place you just have to go and see. An exhibition inspired by it is surely doomed to fail – the mystery killed by cases of broken beakers. But The World of Stonehenge is as magical as a great barrow full of glinting treasure. It hooks you with a wooden trident (two of these are on display) and plunges you into primal waters of the imagination. It is a knockout epic. It can’t include Stonehenge, of course, but it does have Seahenge. This monument is made of wood and had to be removed from its seashore home to preserve it – so here it returns from the past. Gnarled wooden columns stand in the twilight. You go up to the semicircle and stare closer into their ridged brown surfaces. Maybe you glimpse a face, an eye, a shadowy form. You know these are not just old posts but the embodiment of ancient powers whose names we have forgotten, for now.  Seahenge is the physical and emotional heart of the British Museum’s moving journey to the lost world of European prehistory. It was erected by the shore in Norfolk in 2049BC (according to tree ring analysis), around 500 years after the main construction of Stonehenge. It brings the outdoors inside, and holds you mystified. But if you are not already in a pretty woozy state by the time you reach this installation, you haven’t paid attention. Even the stone axes astound, arranged in a wall of smooth jade forms whose similarity becomes an asset. In front of the axes are finds from Avalon Marsh. This is not a new folk festival but a bog outside Glastonbury whose name associates it with King Arthur. The ancient wooden track reassembled here helped people keep their feet dry crossing this wetland nearly 6,000 years ago. Also from Avalon Marsh is a rough wooden idol that’s contemporary with Stonehenge. It has “male and female attributes”, says the catalogue: breasts and a phallus. Was it thrown in the marsh deliberately? Like Arthur getting his sword from the Lady of the Lake, ancient people seem to have seen magic in water and cached gods and weapons there. Seahenge is surely the expression of a reverence for the grey waters of the North Sea. The centre of the belief system that built Stonehenge, however, was the sun. You meet it right at the start of this exhibition on a standing stone from Italy that has drawings scratched on its front. Human figures and herds of animals scurry about under a huge round flaming sun engraved at the summit of the stone. The sun also glows in gold against a blue bronze sky on the Nebra Sky Disc, from Germany, a stunning map of the night sky made about 3,600 years ago: the Pleiades twinkle between the sun and a crescent moon, apparently showing a juxtaposition that was later used by Babylonian astronomers to calculate leap years. There is also a boat on the Sky Disc – the boat of the sun. This is a reminder that Stonehenge was built when the pyramids were being raised in Egypt. Next to the Great Pyramid at Giza survives the Solar Boat of Khufu, a full-sized ship for him to sail through the sky with the sun god. It’s customary to look down on the people who created Stonehenge, compared with the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians: they were after all illiterate. But this exhibition turns that upside down. The world unveiled here is remote but not “primitive”. Stonehenge and other monuments in the British landscape are cleverly, exactly aligned to sunrise on the winter solstice, so people could gather there at the dawn of the shortest day to propitiate the sun to renew their crops. It worked: they had a hearty lifestyle. This is shown by the cosy domesticity of Skara Brae, Orkney, where people lived in snug houses with stone shelf units – it was like The Flintstones. This is a fiercely emotional exhibition, full of love for the people of the distant past. It even wants us to learn from them. The early agriculturalists who built the henges were communal, sharing feasts at a camp called Durrington Walls near Stonehenge. There are even remains from a party when early farmers and the last hunter-gatherers ate together, the hunters cooking venison they caught, the farmers serving beef from their herd. Soon after the lintels were placed across the sarsens at Stonehenge, evidence of inequality and power intrudes on the hippy days of collectivism. The landscape around Stonehenge is dotted with barrows where notables were buried with rich grave goods. Trade was on a new scale. So was war. The exhibition culminates in glory and horror, with astonishing evidence of a Europe where combat was king. There are shattered human remains from a German battlefield, stunningly sophisticated Bronze Age armour and a man buried on Salisbury Plain with arrow heads in his spine. This is up there with the British Museum’s legendary shows on the Terracotta Army and Aztecs. It uncovers a rich and strange world under our own feet. You almost agree with the William Blake prints at the end that Stonehenge is the temple of lost Albion, a better Britain before our dark satanic mills.

2/15/2022,"Donald Trump’s longtime accountancy firm cut ties with his business last week, saying that nearly a decade’s worth of Trump’s filings should “no longer be relied upon”. The move comes amid ongoing criminal and civil investigations into whether Trump illegally inflated the value of his assets.  In a letter to the Trump Organization dated 9 February, William Kelly, US general counsel of the accountancy firm Mazars, said Trump’s financial statements for the period 30 June 2011 to 30 June 2020 “should no longer be replied upon and you should inform any recipients thereof who are currently relying upon one or more of those documents that those documents should not be relied upon”. Mazars added it would no longer “provide any new work product to the Trump Organization”. The statement was disclosed in the new court documents filed on Monday by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who, along with the Manhattan district attorney’s office, has been investigating whether Trump used false financial statements to defraud lenders. James cited the letter as her office asked a state judge to order the Trump Organization, Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump and others to comply with subpoenas seeking documents and testimony. “While we have not concluded that the various financial statements, as a whole, contain material discrepancies, based on the totality of the circumstances, we believe our advice to no longer rely upon those financial statements is appropriate,” Mazars said in its letter to Alan Garten, the Trump Organization’s top lawyer. Last month James’s office told a court that its investigators had uncovered evidence that Trump’s company used “fraudulent or misleading” asset valuations to get loans and tax benefits. Using statements from Mazars, the New York attorney general’s office claimed, among other issues, that the company had misreported the size of Trump’s Manhattan penthouse, saying it was almost 30,000 sq ft, nearly three times its actual size, and inflated the value of Trump golf clubs in Westchester county, New York, and Scotland. In 2019, Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney and an ex-vice-president of the Trump Organization, told Congress that Trump regularly falsified his assets. In an interview with the Guardian last month Cohen said: “We are seeing individuals who have continuously escaped responsibility for their actions finally being held accountable.” In a statement given to CNN a Trump Organization spokesperson said: “While we are disappointed that Mazars has chosen to part ways, their February 9, 2022 letter confirms that after conducting a subsequent review of all prior statements of financial condition, Mazars’ work was performed in accordance with all applicable accounting standards and principles and that such statements of financial condition do not contain any material discrepancies. This confirmation effectively renders the investigations by the DA and AG moot.”",News/US news,"Trump Organization’s accountants cut ties, calling years of filings unreliable",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/14/donald-trump-organization-accountants-mazars-cut-ties
2/15/2022,"Labour will pledge this week to reverse the decline in manufacturing, as new figures show a fall of 93,000 jobs in the sector since the Conservatives took power. Touring the north-west of England on Tuesday, Keir Starmer will highlight figures in Germany, where more than 1 million manufacturing jobs have been created over the same period.  The Labour leader said manufacturing was in deep decline under the Tories because of low investment and cuts to skills budgets. He will visit Burnley, now a marginal Tory seat that was won by the Conservatives in 2019 – the first time in 100 years. In the new analysis released by Labour before Starmer’s visit, the party said jobs in manufacturing fell by 93,000 between the end of 2009 and the end of 2021. This includes 16,000 jobs lost in the north of England and 18,500 in the Midlands. Starmer will tour the heavily leave constituency to underline the need to revive areas where manufacturing had declined. He said a Labour government would reverse that trend with a combination of investment in new technologies and training – especially in green technologies – and the awarding of more public contracts to British businesses. The Labour leader will visit What More, a north-west manufacturer of reusable plastic storage boxes and homeware, including from recycled single-use plastic. “It’s not enough to just leave the EU and think the job is done: we must now make Brexit work. That means backing the places that powered our country to get our economy motoring again,” Starmer said ahead of the visit. “For too long the decline of manufacturing has been treated as if it was inevitable and irreversible. I will never accept that. But these figures show how the government’s failure to back British business has led to a shocking decline in the number of jobs.” He said Labour would have “practical plans to buy, make and sell in Britain … We would be as ambitious for towns and cities across the country as they are for themselves, investing in skills, technology, and quality jobs – so that people once again feel the benefits of British industry.” Starmer said his father’s job as a toolmaker gave him first-hand knowledge of “the pride that comes with creating and building things – and the pain felt when the Tories dismantle that hard work”. “That’s why it’s a crucial part of my contract with the British people, which will build a new Britain that guarantees security, prosperity and respect for all” he said. Earlier on the first day of his three-day tour in Sunderland, Starmer confirmed that he had received death threats following Boris Johnson’s false claim that he failed to prosecute paedophile Jimmy Savile while director of public prosecutions. Police have launched an investigation into online death threats against the Labour leader, but Starmer said he did not want to discuss them in detail. “I do not like talking about this because I have got young children,” he told BBC Radio Newcastle. “It’s very important for me to say that what the prime minister said was wrong, it was very wrong. He knew exactly what he was doing. There has been a rightwing conspiracy theory for some time that’s a complete fabrication. He fed into that, and that has caused difficulty.”",News/Politics,Labour vows to reverse decline in UK manufacturing,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/14/labour-vows-to-reverse-decline-in-uk-manufacturing
2/15/2022,"It might be fashion week in New York at the moment, but Monday was also Valentine’s Day. For the Coach show in the afternoon, each guest – including rapper Megan Thee Stallion, singer Rina Sawayama and model Hari Nef – was greeted with a red rose on their seat and given a heart-shaped cookie. This old-fashioned, unapologetically schmaltzy gesture suited a show that was flush with retro Americana references. The set included several A-frame houses, trees and a station wagon. The preamble featured a model taking her shopping into one of the houses in a brown paper bag, an ET-worthy group of young people on bikes, and another model walking a glossy Afghan hound. This heightened ordinariness gave a halcyon small-town feel. It was about imagining a place where, as the show notes said, “it’s always the golden hour and things are happening – on the street, inside our homes, and in our hearts.”  British designer Stuart Vevers has been the creative director of Coach since 2013 and has shaped an aesthetic that draws on American scenes, subcultures and icons to bring a sense of cool to an established heritage brand. This idea continued in the autumn/winter 2022 collection. Babydoll dresses had a 60s vintage feel that nodded to Edie Sedgwick and L7. Sheepskin jackets over bikini tops, worn with baseball caps, had a surfy feel. Male models in leather waistcoats and trousers were very Jim Morrison. There were 80s downtown graffiti graphics, in collaboration with graffiti artist duo Mint & Serf. And oversized T-shirts and chunky coloured sunglasses – as well as male models in skirts – brought grunge back once again. The Carpenters’ Superstar was on the soundtrack. If these references are from the past, they appeal to present youth culture – one obsessed with past aesthetics and retro dressing. This is consistent with Coach’s strategy under Vevers to make their brand relevant to millennials and Gen Z. Celebrities with influence are now attached – Jennifer Lopez, Michael B Jordan and Megan Thee Stallion have appeared in their campaigns recently. In addition to this, the brand has ventured into NFTs. Late last year, they launched a collection of 80 pieces of collective art, which sold out in 11 seconds. This play for a younger demographic is helped by the fact that – relatively speaking – Coach is reasonably priced, and therefore more attainable. A bag from the brand is priced about £400, compared with nearly four times that for a bag by Valentino or Gucci. Coach’s investment in younger consumers is paying off. Part of the Tapestry group that also owns Kate Spade New York and Stuart Weitzman, the group says working more with digital saw them acquire about 3 million new customers in North America since December, and the overall digital business across the group grew by 30% in the most recent quarter. Coach is Tapestry’s most successful brand – and this success aligns with Vevers’ time as creative director. It recorded its highest quarter of revenue in 10 years in the final quarter of 2021. Sales rose by 24% to approximately $1.5bn (£1.1bn), up from $1.2bn (£0.88bn) a year ago.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Coach brings its American heritage aesthetic to New York Fashion Week,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/14/coach-brings-its-american-heritage-aesthetic-to-new-york-fashion-week
2/15/2022,"Anti-hate speech activists have condemned the Republican US congressman Jim Jordan for his apparent endorsement of Donald Trump’s declaration that members of Hillary Clinton’s campaign staff should have been executed. Jordan asserted on Fox & Friends that the former president was “right on target” when he accused Clinton’s aides of spying on him, and that in another time in US history their “crime would have been punishable by death”.  But the position of the Ohio rightwinger and fierce Trump loyalist, who is resisting efforts from a congressional committee to explain his own role in the deadly 6 January Capitol riot that Trump incited, serves only to stoke further the country’s volatile political divisions and promote more violence, the groups say. “Trump and Jordan are escalating tensions at a time when this country sorely needs healing,” Michael Edison Hayden, senior investigative journalist with the Southern Poverty Law Center’s intelligence project, told the Guardian. “Couple those words with Marjorie Taylor Greene’s statements about breaking apart the country and you can pretty easily see how integrated the extreme far-right fringe has become in the contemporary Republican party. “Some of these politicians sound more like 8chan posters, or Daily Stormer commenters, than leaders,” he added. Trump, who continues to promote the baseless “big lie” that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him, even as he mulls another run for the White House in 2024, was no stranger to inciting his supporters to violence, or the threat of it, long before the attack on the US Capitol that claimed five lives. During his four years in the White House he failed to condemn white supremacists at a rally in Charlottesville, in which a protester was murdered, insisting there were “very fine people on both sides”. During the first presidential debate with Joe Biden in 2020, Trump urged the extremist Proud Boys, notorious for street brawls, to “stand back and stand by” during a segment on political violence. And he told the 6 January rioters “we love you” in a video address after they ransacked the Capitol building. In linking the specter of execution to campaign workers for Clinton, a familiar target of his ire despite his victory over her in the 2016 election, Trump is blowing on a familiar dog whistle, some analysts say. And politicians such as Jordan endorsing or amplifying his words merely continue to ingrain violence into the political mainstream, they add. “The bottom line is that people pay attention to what is being said in the public square, whether it’s sitting presidents, former presidents, or other elected officials,” said Oren Segal, vice-president for the Anti Defamation League’s center on extremism. “[We’re] in a time where we are seeing extremists feel that their agendas are legitimized. Any language that normalizes violence is simply dangerous.” Jordan appeared on Fox & Friends to discuss a filing by justice department special investigator John Durham, a Trump appointee, that alleged operatives paid by the Clinton campaign had accessed White House servers in an effort to “dig up dirt”. “In a stronger period of time in our country, this crime would have been punishable by death,” Trump’s statement said, in part. During the Fox interview, Jordan was not asked directly about Trump’s allusion to executions, but over the weekend he retweeted a Fox News article about it that included the “punishable by death” comments in full. “We’ve never seen anything like this in history,” Jordan said. “So President Trump’s statement is right on target. This is truly unprecedented, truly something that has never happened in the history of our great country.” To Segal, the episode is a further example of extremism masquerading as mainstream. “That sort of language about people should be put to death, or that there should be violent consequences to people’s actions, is quite common among extremist circles. It’s the lifeblood of social media, the propaganda we see in so many different spaces,” he said. “And yet it’s not just limited to extremist discussions online, it’s now part of the public discussion amplified by elected officials. This is why it is so dangerous. It’s no longer fringe commentary that one would expect, it’s part of the broader public discussion, which only serves to animate the extremes more.”",News/US news,Congressman echoes Trump’s claim that Clinton aides deserved to die,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/14/us-congressman-jim-jordan-echoes-trump-clinton-aides-executed
