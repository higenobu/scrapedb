3/8/2022,"Boris Johnson has denied that he intervened to secure a peerage for Evgeny Lebedev after intelligence services warned it would be a security risk, arguing that such suggestions could be motivated by anti-Russian prejudice. Answering questions during a brief TV clip on Monday, the prime minister did not, however, deny meeting the Russian-British newspaper owner at the start of the Covid pandemic in March 2020, shortly before the peerage was formalised. The prime minister, asked if he had overruled the concerns over Lebedev, who was made a peer in July 2020, said: “That is simply incorrect. “But what I can tell you is that it suits Putin’s agenda to try to characterise this as a struggle between the west and Russia. It suits his agenda to say that we in Nato countries are anti-Russian, that European countries are now anti-Russian. And it’s very, very, very important that we get the message over that we’re not anti-Russian.” Keir Starmer has called for parliament’s intelligence and security committee to investigate the circumstances around Lebedev’s elevation to the Lords, following a fresh report Johnson had intervened. Such a move “would obviously be extraordinary, but that’s not the case”, Johnson said. Asked if he had met Lebedev, a longtime friend of his, in March 2020, Johnson ignored the question but did not deny it. “It is very, very important that this should not turn into a general sense that we are against Russians, that any Russian living in the UK, any Russian who contributes to UK society should be suddenly under suspicion. That suits Putin’s agenda,” he said. Johnson’s spokesperson said all peerages were vetted by the House of Lords appointments commission (Holac) and that in the case of Lebedev “this was done entirely properly and correctly”. The controversy around Lebedev’s appointment was reignited with a Sunday Times story headlined: “Lebedev got peerage after spies dropped warning,” which followed previous reporting in the Guardian and Byline Times. Holac had initially asked Downing Street to reconsider the nomination, after hearing evidence from Britain’s security services that Lebedev was deemed a potential security risk because of his father, Alexander Lebedev, a one-time Moscow spy. Defending the peerage on Monday, the Foreign Office minister James Cleverly argued that Alexander Lebedev’s activities were not relevant. “My father was a former chartered surveyor, but I’m not. So what your father did for work is I’m not completely sure totally relevant,” Cleverly told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Since taking up his peerage in December 2020, Lebedev has spoken only once and never voted. Cleverly argued: “There are lots of members of the House of Lords who are not active members of the House of Lords. It rather flies in the face of this accusation that somehow he is distorting British politics if he is not voting on British laws.” Asked whether it was disappointing that Lebedev had barely been in the Lords, Johnson’s spokesperson said: “I haven’t asked him that specific question but many have roles outside parliament and you’ll be aware of the wide-ranging roles of this individual, which you are well aware of.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson denies overruling spies’ concerns over Evgeny Lebedev peerage,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/07/boris-johnson-denies-overruling-spies-concerns-over-evgeny-lebedev-peerage
3/8/2022,"Musos and gamers were left scratching their heads last Wednesday as Bandcamp, the online record store hailed by independent artists as a bankable alternative to the razor-thin royalties of streaming, announced its acquisition by Epic Games, makers of the online gaming phenomenon Fortnite. Bandcamp CEO Ethan Diamond framed the deal as a boon for artists, saying that the two US companies shared a vision of building “the most open, artist-friendly ecosystem in the world”. A blogpost from Epic underlined the need for “fair and open platforms” to enable “creators to keep the majority of their hard-earned money”. But Bandcamp users reacted with shock and disappointment to the sale of the indie juggernaut, lamenting the loss of “our” store, as drummer and Spotify critic Damon Krukowski tweeted. “We all just got sold,” lamented media theorist McKenzie Wark. Bemused gamers and tech experts, meanwhile, wondered what possible uses a company such as Epic – itself 40% owned by Chinese gaming megacorp Tencent – might have for the direct-to-fan marketplace for MP3s of niche musical genres like vaporwave and chiptune. Since its founding in 2008, Bandcamp has become a cornerstone of the global underground music economy through its “pay-what-you-want” download structure and low commissions, taking a 15% cut of every sale. During the pandemic, the San Francisco-based company earned kudos for waiving that fee on the first Friday of every month, generating millions of dollars for artists, as well as donating to racial justice campaigns including the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Epic has its own track record as a plucky indie, having remained largely in the hands of CEO Tim Sweeney since its founding in 1991. Like Bandcamp, Epic takes a relatively small cut from developers, setting its commission at 12% compared with Apple’s 30%. Epic even took Apple to court – and lost, at great expense – to accuse the tech giant of monopolising the mobile gaming industry. But the company’s fortunes have soared in recent years after the success of Fortnite and other free-to-play games. Now valued at $28bn, and facing its own controversies over data collection and Store exclusivity, it’s no longer a feisty underdog. Many independent artists, already squeezed by the collapse of physical sales and – since Covid – a long hiatus from touring, see the Bandcamp sale as another disappointment in a long tradition of indie sellouts. But tech experts and neophyte musicians have also been speculating on the possibility of new integrations between Bandcamp’s vast catalogue of music and Epic’s cutting-edge game technology. These range from live-streaming events such as Fortnite’s virtual concerts, which have seen artists Travis Scott and Marshmello putting on trippy performances for millions of emoting avatars, to social spaces such as Party Worlds, designed for virtual hangouts rather than combat and destruction. Beyond the busy world of Fortnite, Epic could also be thinking about easy routes into licensing music for software developers using Unreal Engine, the open and free-to-use development platform built by Epic’s Sweeney. There are obvious opportunities for integration with Harmonix, the games studio behind Guitar Hero and Rock Band. More importantly, Sweeney is a longtime proponent of virtual reality and its buzzy reincarnation as the metaverse, the promise of a virtual 3D environment built from interconnecting spaces and social networks. “The most plausible way the metaverse is going to rise,” Sweeney said in 2020, “isn’t from one company, even Epic, building this thing and forcing everybody to use it. It’s going to be from more and more companies and brands connecting their products and services.” In that sense, Epic’s acquisition can also be read as a play for the hearts and minds of the next generation of musicians and music lovers who have grown up in virtual worlds such as Fortnite. Rather than attempting to convert digital natives into record-buying traditionalists, the smart move could be to meet Generation Z where they already are, among the 160 million players inside the Epic Games Store. Selling to Epic may also have presented itself as the least worst option for a company under pressure to provide returns for its early investors. Bandcamp received venture capital backing in its early years, and though the precise numbers involved are unknown, market logic dictates that VC-backed startups eventually start looking for an exit: either float on the stock market, which works for companies showing impressive growth and significant future valuation, or sell up. Whether or not that’s the case for Bandcamp, it won’t do much to cheer up the musicians and fans who long ago identified Silicon Valley economics as the source of their woes. On social media, the deal was met with cynicism by some of the musicians who make up Bandcamp’s global community of creator-consumers. “It’s VC-funded and has always been part of platform capitalism, where growth is paramount,” wrote experimental artist Zola Jesus. The irony is that Bandcamp has always positioned itself as a “community” rather than a marketplace, yet that community has not been given a say in the fate of the value it has created. The solution, say some artists, is to take back control – either by moving over to a platform like Resonate, a streaming cooperative owned by its users, or exploring new Web3 protocols for collective ownership. Austin Robey, co-founder of alternative music platform Ampled, advocates for an “exit to community”, a model where startups are taken over by the users and stakeholders who depend on the product or service they’ve created. Still, no other indie platform has yet achieved anything like the scale or appeal of Bandcamp, and the shift to alternative platforms will require a leap of technical literacy that most artists and fans aren’t ready to make. In the short term, Bandcamp remains the slickest direct-to-fan operation in town – and is still paying out millions to artists. “The products and services you depend on aren’t going anywhere,” assured Diamond in his statement. Nothing will change in the short term, is the promise – although it’s the same one that accompanies every similar acquisition. Those old enough to remember losing their MySpace music overnight may be feeling itchy. Word to the wise, advised one suspicious user, “download all your Bandcamp MP3s if you haven’t yet”.",Arts/Music,Bandcamp sells to Epic: can a video game company save independent music?,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/07/bandcamp-sells-to-epic-can-a-video-game-company-save-independent-music
3/8/2022,"They are generally to be found in urban areas, using purpose-built skate parks or scouting out suitable flights of steps, handrails and concrete slopes to try out their airborne stunts. But a country road in Wiltshire has become an unlikely draw for skaters, skateboarders, BMX and scooter riders after it buckled and cracked in spectacular fashion, creating undulations and angles perfect for spins, jumps and flips. Subsidence caused the B4069, near the village of Lyneham to break up last month, leaving it looking as if an earthquake had hit. The police ordered motorists not to try to get through and a diversion was put in place. Wiltshire council has said rebuilding the road could take up to a year and cost more than £1m. After images of the road were carried first in the local media, then nationally, thrill-seekers realised it could be an interesting makeshift skate park to practise their skills on. Dozens have already tried out the site, leaping across the cracks, using the humps as ramps. Some have found ways of flipping off trees that have bent in towards the road while others use barriers brought in to block off the road as hurdles. Among those who have made the pilgrimage are Si Coburn and Ollie Jones, well-known figures in inline skating, who travelled from Gloucestershire to pit their skills against, or with, the road. Videos of their stunts on the B4069 have been posted online. Wiltshire police had urged motorists to stay away, but had not thought to ask skaters to steer clear. The force warned: “As anyone living in the area of Lyneham, Dauntsey, Bradenstoke or the villages around will be aware, the B4069 at the Lyneham Banks is closed following the road subsiding. “Unfortunately some drivers are ignoring the closure at the bottom of the hill and driving up the Banks. This could put the council workers who are working on the road in danger. The road is not passable at all, please do not ignore the closure thinking it doesn’t apply to you.” The reason for the road cracking is not clear. One expert, the geotechnical specialist Clive Edmonds, told the magazine New Civil Engineer that the earth may have moved because of a buildup of pressure in groundwater held within the rock or soil. Mark McClelland, the cabinet member for transport at Wiltshire council, said: “The road has suffered some major damage that will take a long time to fix, and at a significant cost that could run over £1m. “We first have to establish the cause, and then the remedy. This is a major civil engineering project that could take into 2023 to resolve, so unfortunately people should be prepared for the closure to be in place for a long time to come.”",News/UK news,Wiltshire road becomes a skate park after it cracks and buckles,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/07/wiltshire-road-becomes-a-skate-park-after-it-cracks-and-buckles
3/8/2022,"Age: It’s been going on for months. Appearance: Immersive course in singing like Madonna, dancing like Madonna and acting like Madonna. What for? So that you can be exactly like Madonna. Yes, but to what end? In order to play Madonna in a forthcoming biopic about Madonna. This sounds amazing! It is definitely a huge role, in what is destined to be an immense project. Who’s directing? Madonna, from a screenplay co-written by Madonna. And this Madonna course – is it like an all-day thing? According to insiders it consists of 11-hour sessions with Madonna’s choreographer. Wow, sounds intense. Followed by further choreography sessions with Madonna herself, followed by readings with Madonna and singing with Madonna. I don’t think I want to be in this movie any more. Luckily, you’re not in the running. Who is? Among those thought to be still in contention are Julia Garner from Ozark, British actor Florence Pugh and Euphoria star Alexa Demie.You mean they haven’t decided? No, the production is very much in the auditions phase. Emma Laird, Bebe Rexha and Sky Ferreira have also been considered. People are having gruelling Madonna lessons with Madonna, and they haven’t even got the part yet? The successful applicant will face months of further Madonna training prior to shooting, before being directed by Madonna in the art of acting like Madonna. Has Madonna directed anything before? Oh yes. She made her directorial debut back in 2008 with the comedy-drama Filth and Wisdom. Never saw it. What was it like? The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw described it as “incredibly bad”. Are you perhaps taking his words out of context? He actually wrote: “She has made a movie so incredibly bad that Berlin festival-goers were staggering around yesterday in a state of clinical shock, deathly pale and mewing like maltreated kittens.” Not exactly two thumbs up, is it? No, but Madonna did go on to direct another film, W.E. in 2011. Haven’t seen that either. Any better? No. And she’s not only directing this new biopic about her own self, she has written the screenplay as well? She was actually co-writing it with Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody, but Cody has since exited the project. A potentially wise move. Don’t worry – another co-writer, Erin Cressida Wilson, is now on board. Do say: “Again, but this time more like me!” Don’t say: “Say Madonna, have you given any thought to playing the part yourself?”",Arts/Music,"Madonna bootcamp: singing, acting and 11-hour dance sessions – is anyone tough enough to take on the material girl?",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/07/madonna-bootcamp-singing-acting-and-11-hour-dance-sessions-is-anyone-tough-enough-to-take-on-the-material-girl
3/8/2022,"The international court of justice (ICJ) has said it will decide “as soon as possible” on a Ukrainian demand for an emergency order that Russia halt hostilities immediately, after a hearing in The Hague that was boycotted by Moscow. The UN’s highest court closed a hearing on Monday afternoon a day earlier than planned because of the Russian boycott. Ukraine said Russia was obliged to listen to whatever the ICJ ruled. The court is using a fast-track procedure that can bring a ruling on provisional redress in days. There is no chance of Russia complying with the ruling, but it will deal another blow to Moscow’s waning diplomatic prestige. Ukraine accuses Russia of illegally justifying its war by falsely alleging genocide in the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. The case is one of a number being taken by Ukraine to international courts in an attempt to secure a ruling that Russia is acting illegally, or committing war crimes. “The fact that Russia’s seats are empty speaks loudly,” said the Ukrainian envoy, Anton Korynevych. They are not here in this court of law: they are on a battlefield waging an aggressive war against my country.” He urged Russia to “lay down your arms and put forward your evidence”. Acting for Ukraine in the court, David Zionts said: “Ukraine comes to this court because of a grotesque lie and to seek protection from the devastating consequences of that lie. The lie is the Russian Federation’s claim of genocide in Ukraine. The consequences are unprovoked aggression, cities under siege, civilians under fire, humanitarian catastrophe and refugees fleeing for their lives.” The ICJ was set up after the second world war to rule on disputes between UN member states, based mainly on treaties and conventions. Its rulings are binding but it has no real means to enforce them. The ICJ’s president, Joan Donoghue, said the court regretted Russia’s non-attendance. The ICJ is empowered to give a ruling when one of the parties does not attend to give evidence whether in writing or in person. Ukraine wants the court to take provisional measures ordering Russia to “immediately suspend the military operations”, pending a full judgment on the dispute which could take years. The case centres on the interpretation of the 1948 UN convention on genocide, signed by both countries. The treaty names the ICJ as the forum for resolving disputes between signatories. Russia says it is acting in compliance with the UN charter to prevent a genocide which it claims has been committed against Russian-speaking Ukrainians, mainly in the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk. Vladimir Putin has said Russia’s “special military action” is needed “to protect people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide”, in reference to those whose first or only language is Russian. A leading association of genocide scholars has backed the view of Ukraine and western powers that Russia was misappropriating the term “genocide” to describe the treatment of Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. “There is absolutely no evidence that there is genocide going on in Ukraine,” Melanie O’Brien, the president of International Association of Genocide Scholars, told Reuters. Since its full invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February, Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians. The official UN civilian death toll is 364, including more than 20 children, though officials say the true toll is probably higher. “Putin lies and Ukrainians – our citizens – die,” Korynevych told the court. “Russia must be stopped and the court has a role to play in stopping it.” The ICJ is the highest court for resolving disputes between states, and while cases there usually take years, it has a fast-track procedure to look at requests for “provisional measures” to prevent situations from worsening. The case is separate to a Ukraine war crimes investigation launched by the international criminal court, a different tribunal that is also based in The Hague. The chief prosecutor at the international criminal court, Karim Khan, said last week that he would go ahead with an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine since Moscow’s invasion.",News/World news,International court of justice to fast-track ruling on Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/international-court-of-justice-to-fast-track-ruling-on-russian-invasion-of-ukraine
3/8/2022,"Russian forces are continuing to pound Ukrainian cities, including residential areas, with missile strikes and artillery fire, and Ukraine has dismissed as immoral and unacceptable Russian proposals to evacuate civilians along routes into Russia or Belarus. Russian forces have opened fire on the city of Mykolaiv, and shelling has continued in the suburbs of Kyiv, including Irpin, which has been cut off from electricity, water and heating for three days. On Sunday civilians came under fire as they tried to leave areas including Irpin, where a young family was killed. A second attempt at a mass evacuation from the strategic southern port city of Mariupol also failed. The city is short on water, food and power, and mobile phone networks are down. The UN’s refugee agency said more than 1.7 million Ukrainians have fled since the outbreak of the war. On Thursday 24 February, Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv. A substantial attack was aimed at the eastern city of Kharkiv. Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea. On Friday 25 February, Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer: On Saturday 26 February, Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces. On Monday 28 February, Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in Kharkiv. Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. On Tuesday 1 March, Russian forces bombarded the government headquarters in Kharkiv, and the armoured column continued rolling towards the capital. On Wednesday 2, Moscow’s forces took the port and train station in the strategically important city of Kherson, on the Black Sea. Russian paratroopers landed in Kharkiv overnight, after several days of fierce bombardment that killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Kyiv came under more heavy shelling as Russian forces stepped up their offensive and moved closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it. Mariupol was reportedly surrounded by Russian troops. A week into the Russian invasion, on Thursday 3 March, the Black Sea port of Kherson became the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Moscow’s forces. On Friday 4, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was seized by Russian military forces after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours at the largest facility of its kind in Europe. On Saturday 5 a deal to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and the nearby town of Volnovakha collapsed, and residents in occupied Kherson and Melitopol took part in anti-Russia demonstrations. Over the past few months Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Vladimir Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment has since grown. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also show increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. Since then low-level fighting has continued along the front, and each side has accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands is a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/russia-war-ukraine-complete-guide-maps-video-and-pictures

3/8/2022,"In 2017, Cambridge University’s musical theatre society invited applications for an original show that it could take to the Edinburgh fringe. Toby Marlow and I were third years at the university, and had talked about doing a musical together for ages, so he applied, saying he would write a show with pop music and lots of women at its centre. Representation of women on stage was in the cultural conversation – later that year #MeToo happened. The fringe has so many professional productions, you need a hook for your student show. The “real housewives of Shakespeare” and a Wicked-type backstory for the witches in Macbeth were two of Toby’s ideas. But if you’re looking for a famous group of women who are out of copyright, the most obvious are the six wives of Henry VIII. “What if the wives were a pop group giving a concert?” asked Toby. I was like: “Sure! But that sounds like it could be so terrible. We’ll have to make sure it isn’t.” The format was inspired by Beyoncé’s Live at Roseland show. I was studying history but couldn’t remember much about the Tudors, beyond Henry possibly writing Greensleeves about Anne Boleyn. Anyway I had my dissertation to write so didn’t have much time for reading. My main research was Lucy Worsley’s TV series. I love the way she gets dressed up, pretending to be a lady in waiting and looking over her shoulder at the camera. It’s so ridiculous! We wrote half the show over four days in the Easter holiday; the rest we finished in our final term. We took a student production of Six to Edinburgh that summer. The costumes were very low budget – Anne Boleyn had a tiara from Claire’s Accessories. No one was paid, it was just for fun. Our venue in Grassmarket was a converted hotel conference centre. I set up the first couple of shows then went back to Cambridge to direct a Shakespeare play. I just didn’t think Six would be so important. But it quickly started selling out and it wasn’t just our friends buying tickets. After the fringe we put it on in Cambridge. The producer Kenny Wax saw it and said he had a show at the Arts theatre in London that wasn’t playing on Mondays. Would we like to do a showcase with a professional company on those nights? We did that, recorded an album, toured the show, then went back to the Arts for an open-ended run. I’d thought that after uni I’d move back in with my mum, send emails to theatre directors asking to shadow them and slowly try to work my way into the industry. I was fast-tracked by Six. People get in touch now and say they’d love to learn from me but I don’t know what I’m doing! Six fans are incredibly creative and make fan art of me and Toby with the queens. Audiences started to come in homemade costumes. Our materials had been sourced from Shepherd’s Bush Market, but once fans found out where to get the Anne Boleyn material we had to go and buy all of it in order to make more costumes ourselves! At school you learn about the Tudors and the “divorced, beheaded, died” rhyme, but the focus is on Henry, not the wives. I went to the audition for the Arts theatre showcase knowing it was a retelling of history from the wives’ point of view. They said bring a pop song – I sang If I Ain’t Got You by Alicia Keys. The audition was a lot friendlier than they usually are. On the first day of rehearsals, Toby and Lucy sang the songs for us. The wives were witty, clever, well-rounded women and it was such a relatable script, so modern. I thought: “Wow, this is genius. If I came to see this show, I would want to be in it.” Each queen took some inspiration from a different pop star. Catherine of Aragon was very much Beyoncé, Anne Boleyn had Lily Allen and Kate Nash vibes. Jane Seymour is sort of Adele with a bit of Demi Lovato. My solo, Heart of Stone, is a big song and was a bit daunting at first, but I just felt like it was written for me. Over almost four years singing it, I constantly found new things to discover. We only had a couple of weeks to put everything together for the first show. It was a bit of a stress but I’ve never laughed so much in rehearsals. The workshop cast recorded the album, too. We had no idea it would end up with over 100m streams! If someone told me I’d have freaked out. Most of how the show looked was very different from how it is now. My first costume was a jumpsuit from Zara with a corset and we all had heeled trainers on. Later, Gabriella Slade designed incredible bright and sparkly costumes. When I heard I was doing a show with only women in it there was this fear about having six strong characters in a room. There’s a stereotype about that. But on Six everyone built each other up. When we first took the show on tour we only had one cover, Grace Mouat, for all six of us – she was our seventh member. I still have a huge bond with the girls. They’re like my sisters.

3/8/2022,"The release of a new Pixar film, once a major, all-attention-securing event, has received a notable downgrade in recent years, not just because of a considerable dip in quality (arguably just Inside Out and Coco are the only indispensable offerings in the last decade) but because of an inevitable change in release strategy. Just a month before the pandemic truly took hold, the fantasy caper Onward (yet another underwhelming effort) became one of the only 2020 films to get a wide theatrical release and as everything shuttered, Pixar’s next two films – Soul and Luca – levelled down to premieres on Disney+ even though the latter was released at a time when cinemas were fully operational again. It’s a little odd that their latest, Turning Red, will also follow suit given the healthy state of the box office (a bright and zippy pre-spring Pixar adventure would have surely been a hit), but yet another sign of Disney’s bullish attempt to out-Netflix Netflix by forcing even the vaguest of fans on to its ever-growing streaming service. It’s also, perhaps, a self-aware demotion for another under-par film, one that’s not without merits and the occasional biggish swing, but a far far cry from the partnership’s wildly inventive heyday. What once felt organic has come to feel far too over-calculated from the wacky but-wait-what-if set-up to the but-wait-it’s-actually-really-about allegory and coming out less than a year after Luca, which had a similar transformation narrative, Turning Red feels like factory line Pixar. But it’s worth stating that in an ever-saturated landscape for children’s animation, factory line Pixar is still much more proficient than most (excusing last year’s thrilling Netflix caper The Mitchells vs the Machines which had a similar “be your weird self” message) and there are enough high-colour highlights here to enrapture younger audiences while keeping elders at least somewhat involved, and at times directly spoken to, at the same time. Toronto-set Turning Red turns back the clock to 2002 to focus on 13-year-old high-achiever Mei Lee (voiced by Rosalie Chiang), whose close kinship with her three best friends is forever pushed into second place by her demanding yet loving mother (voiced by Sandra Oh). Trying to juggle both sides of her life becomes even more challenging when Mei Lee discovers that one day, any extreme emotional state, otherwise known as having hormones, turns her to a giant red panda. It’s rather awkward given the chaos of her adolescence but initial horror soon turns into something more manageable when she discovers the upsides of her new condition. There’s an all-too-recent whiff of the aforementioned Luca as well as elements of Disney’s Brave from 2012 and Inside Out three years later; like those films, we’re dealing with the pains of youth and how growing up affects the family dynamic as reflected via an outlandish conceit. Playwright Julia Cho and co-writer-director Domee Shi have at least tried to add some specificity to the dog-eared formula as well as bravely, for the territory, confronting the less historically Disney-friendly elements of the experience. When Mei Lee first turns into the red panda, her mother assumes that the behind-the-bathroom-door panic is down to her first period and while it really shouldn’t have to be seen as a big deal, for Disney (a studio still playing coy over the existence of LGBTQ people in their live-action, let alone animated, films), it’s a medium-sized step and it’s handled without any expected bashfulness. Mei Lee and her friends are also proud fans of the N*Sync-aping boyband 4*Town and one of her triggers is the feelings they arouse within her, another step toward realising the teenage experience has more nuance than the studio has ever been willing to admit. Like other recent Disney and Disney-Pixar films, Turning Red also does away with both love interest and villain and while the absence of the former remains rewarding (friendship again trumps romance here), there’s a dearth of genuine conflict. The mother-daughter dynamic is deftly avoidant of broad strokes (it’s far more layered and loving than strictness v rebellion) but it’s not quite enough to power the film as it heads to a big set-piece finale. Like Luca before it, Turning Red also takes a nifty idea and coerces it into a less nifty narrative – the girls must monetise the panda to raise money for a concert – and flashes of ingenuity become dulled by the more plodding main plot. There’s also something a little too box-ticking about the period setting, which is never truly justified as anything other than an attempt to appeal to millennial parents who can point and exclaim “That’s Bootylicious!” when Bootylicious plays, nostalgia for nostalgia’s sake. What works far better are the boyband’s songs, crafted by Billie Eilish and Finneas, which are sleek enough to pass as N*Sync-alike earworms. The journey is slick and diverting, and at times incisive, but Turning Red is yet another Pixar film that coasts rather than glides. Hopefully its next offering can turn into something more.

3/8/2022,"The American artist Frank Stella once said that he “could tell a story with shapes”. Paris fashion week has done this too, all the way from Christian Dior’s triumphant postwar new look to the more recent apocalypse-luxe of Vetements’ oversized streetwear. Stella McCartney, whose clothes tend to be about cool silhouettes rather than embroidery or ruffles, has long felt an affinity with Stella that goes beyond their sharing a name. Stella by Stella, presented on the rooftop of the Pompidou Centre, was both a fashion collection and a celebration of the artist.Stella’s 1988 collage piece Ahab was transposed “pure and direct from the canvas” on to fluid stretch viscose dresses, McCartney said. Other prints were dissected, with elements taken out “to extract something more palatable and wearable” that would be appealing rather than overwhelming on a blouse or dress. Stella had approval on every piece, “which was terrifying, because he has great taste, and an incredible knowledge of art and design – and also, he’s really moody”, laughed McCartney backstage after the show. “There were a few things he said no to, but I was amazed by what he let us do.”Stella’s early work tends towards monochrome and straight lines, and this show began at the beginning, opening with a fluffy coat in sustainable, cruelty-free Fur Free Fur covered with early-Stella-esque bold monochrome zigzags. “His more linear early work lends itself so well to tailoring, and I love how he spans minimalism and maximalism, which has such a parallel with our brand, which has a very simple masculine side and then a more explosive, feminine side,” McCartney said. Pinstripes swayed diagonally across a trousersuit, and a knit dress was constructed from triangular panels.The Frank Stella homage pieces were beautiful to look at, but it was the less literal ones that were the most desirable to wear. Ruched and draped dresses in pale pink velvet and belted double satin ones with romantic sweetheart hemline were as perfectly cut as the signature oversized blazers. “All of the wine that you’ve been drinking in lockdown has been turned into a handbag,” joked McCartney backstage of her latest experiment in sustainable fabrics. Handbags were made using a new “unleather” which uses waste grape skins, sourced from Italian wineries close to where the brand’s accessories are made. Another bag in Mylo micelium “unleather” continued the mushroom theme of last season’s collection.The soundtrack ended with John Lennon’s Give Peace A Chance. “I just wanted to let everyone know that everyone at Stella feels such tremendous sadness for everything that the people of Ukraine are going through and that our hearts are with them,” McCartney said.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Stella McCartney dissects work of artist Frank Stella for Paris collection,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/07/stella-mccartney-dissects-work-of-artist-frank-stella-for-paris-collection
3/8/2022,"In 2020, Cécile McLorin Salvant kept getting calls from an unknown number. Like any self-respecting millennial, she ignored them. “They called me so many times and I didn’t answer because no one answers a number that they don’t know,” she says, speaking by Zoom from her New York apartment. When she finally picked up the phone, she “freaked out”. It was the MacArthur Foundation calling to tell her she had been chosen as one of its fellows, an honour that comes with a grant of $625,000 (£475,000) paid over five years. Given that Covid-19 meant her tour had been cancelled, it couldn’t have come at a better time. “It felt like a validation that went beyond music,” says the 32-year-old musician. “It felt like a validation of the way that I think. That’s a huge compliment. It’s the greatest honour.” Although Salvant is known as a jazz musician, her approach to music is defined by her instinct for experimentation. “I’m an interested in bringing things from disparate sources, time periods and techniques,” she says. “I love to go into different sounds and different textures with just my voice alone.” She also makes visual art – colourful figurative works – and approaches her music in a similar vein. “I want my music and my art to feel like you’re opening someone’s diary – there’s an old ticket stub for something, a quote, an idea and frustration and a secret.” Her music is beloved for rejecting traditional jazz standards, embracing theatre and subverting classics with playful renditions. At 21, Salvant won the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition. Her 2013 album WomanChild spanned three centuries of American music and introduced her charismatic voice and spirited energy to the world. She won a Grammy award for best jazz vocal album for her 2015 album, For One to Love, which delved into the history of sexual politics and a more intimate history of unrequited love. From 2018, The Window is more stripped back, with Salvant accompanied only by pianist and organist Sullivan Fortner. Her new album, Ghost Song, combines the sounds she is known for – jazz, folk melodies, blues – and weaves in brand new textures that are less clean. (Her sensibility is reminiscent of Fiona Apple’s on Fetch the Bolt Cutters – both jazz-honed vocalists with an unorthodox approach to their influences.) “Bringing in recorded sources that are not as high fidelity and pristine … moving forward, I want to do that a lot,” says Salvant. “I have always loved field recordings. I’ve been thinking a lot about not trying to drown out the life around us and actually integrating that into the album. We start and end the album with these recordings that are a cappella in a church. You can hear the air.” The first song is a stunning, ethereal cover of Kate Bush’s Wuthering Heights; the last, Salvant’s take on English folk song The Unquiet Grave. They’re the key to this conceptual album about love, loss and what it means to be alive. “If you listen to it on a loop, you realise that the first song is connected to the last song,” she reveals. “I wanted to start with somebody being haunted by the past, and to end with a living person haunting a ghost.” Despite writing primarily about love for the past 12 years, recent episodes of pandemic-induced isolation made the need for love more apparent to Salvant. “I think fundamentally, with great periods of loneliness, and fear and chaos, it becomes almost instinctual to want to talk about love, spread love and lament it,” she says. It’s hard not to imagine more Grammys coming Salvant’s way for Ghost Song – but she has already had the ultimate validation for the album. Her parents “love the album”, she says. “That means the world to me.” Salvant was born in Miami in 1989 to a French mother, an elementary school teacher, and a Haitian father, a doctor. Her face lights up as she talks about their support. “My parents are very curious people. They value kindness, humility, intelligence, and generosity. Me wanting to pursue music wasn’t somehow lesser than if I had wanted to be a doctor.” Pursuit is the word for it. She started piano lessons aged five, sang in a children’s choir aged eight, and took classical voice lessons – although interestingly, she initially loathed being made to practise. “I hated piano. I wanted to quit all the time. I didn’t want to do it. I liked singing, but I was really passive,” she says frankly. “I kick myself every day now thinking how little I took advantage of having these private lessons. That is privilege!” She cultivated her own musical training, honing the power of her voice with renditions of Céline Dion’s My Heart Will Go On in her elementary school loos. “The bathroom was resonant and echoing,” she says. “I would just sing super loud. I didn’t even need to go to the bathroom.” It wasn’t until Salvant briefly diverged from music that she began to take jazz seriously. She moved to France to study law in Grenoble while also studying baroque music and jazz in Aix-en-Provence, where she met teacher Jean-François Bonnel. “He just pushed me every day.” She counts US jazz singer Betty Carter, Aretha Franklin, Caetano Veloso and Bach as formative figures, though she never discounts the influence of the pop icons of her youth: the Backstreet Boys, ’N Sync and the Spice Girls; even Disney soundtracks. “I’ve been thinking more about [all] the cultural things that go into your bloodstream,” she says. “How can that not influence the way that I sing, the way that I write?” Salvant recorded Ghost Song in the early days of the pandemic. Now, new material is the only thing on her mind. “So much has happened since we started, and since we’ve been finished, that it feels almost foreign,” she says. It’s this forward-thinking mentality, you suspect, that the MacArthur Foundation recognised in Salvant. “A MacArthur is a look to the future,” she says. “That’s the part of it that makes it so exciting because it feels like ‘Here. What’s next? What are you going to do now?’”  Ghost Song is out now on Nonesuch Records",Arts/Music,"Jazz genius Cécile McLorin Salvant: ‘In periods of loneliness and fear, it’s instinctual to want to talk about love’",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/07/jazz-genius-cecile-mclorin-salvant-in-periods-of-loneliness-and-fear-its-instinctual-to-want-to-talk-about-love
