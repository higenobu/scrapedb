5/14/2022,"Perhaps the nearest a British courtroom has come to the famous last act of the film A Few Good Men – “I want the truth!” “You can’t handle the truth!” – was late one February afternoon at the 2012 Leveson inquiry into press standards. In the role of Tom Cruise – the cocky, over-paid, over-sexed and over-educated lawyer – was “barrister to the stars” David Sherborne. Taking the part of Jack Nicholson’s grizzled colonel, was the explosively irate Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre. Sherborne, then 43, boyish, tanned and sporting a metropolitan bouffant of hair, clearly represented everything Dacre despised. The lawyer called on the editor to talk about two Mail stories involving the private life of his client, Hugh Grant – and to insinuate the question most guaranteed to put Dacre close to a coronary: the idea, always vehemently denied, that his journalists had been involved in phone hacking. As Sherborne pressed his point, with as much stubborn insubordination as he could muster, Dacre became increasingly apoplectic, fists clenched, teeth grinding, apparently doing everything he could to contain one of the expletive-laden rants his colleagues liked to call “the vagina monologues”: “I’m not going to speculate!” the editor hissed. “I’m not going to been drawn by your innuendo, Mr Sherborne! I’ve made clear my position and I’m not going to deviate from that!” Neither man forgot that encounter. In the months after Lord Leveson’s report was published, Dacre’s Daily Mail led one of its trademark investigations into the private life of Sherborne. The “Loverson inquiry” reported that the “twice divorced” lawyer was in a relationship with the junior counsel acting for Leveson – Carine Patry Hoskins (“the thinking man’s Pippa Middleton”) – who had left her husband, a QC. The pair denied their relationship had begun during the inquiry, which may have raised questions of conflict of interest, despite a holiday in Santorini together. Dacre’s Mail editorial was unconvinced. “Frankly, this affair shows how incestuous, self-righteous and hypocritical the legal profession can be… [the] draconian judge-led privacy laws, superinjunctions, defamation rules that make Britain the libel capital of the world, and the explosion of the no-win, no-fee compensation culture can all be laid at their door.” By the time of Leveson, Sherborne had already become a lavishly rewarded bête noire of the tabloid press, helping, as a junior, to win the landmark 2003 privacy case for Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones against Hello! and acting in Max Mosley’s successful 2008 suit against the News of the World. The publicity around the “Loverson” affair – paparazzi on the lawyer’s doorstep – seemed to convince celebrity and Hollywood clients that he was one of their own. Sherborne’s client list has included Elton John, Harry Styles, Kate Moss and Sienna Miller. During his unsuccessful libel case against the Sun in 2020, more austere colleagues apparently took a dim view of Sherborne’s client, Johnny Depp, greeting him with a man hug on the court steps. Still, when Coleen Rooney was forced to defend herself in court in Rebekah Vardy’s horribly ill-advised “Wagatha Christie” libel action, there was only one man she was likely to call. Watching Sherborne’s three-day cross-examination of Vardy in Court 13 of London’s High Court, has been to witness the best and worst of his style, which fellow barristers describe as a mixture of “undoubted charm”, “showboating” and “frequently pissing off the judge”. If you listened to him with your eyes closed, which became more tempting as the proceedings ground on, he often sounded dangerously close to parodying Peep Show’s David Mitchell, in one of his more unhinged tirades. Still, you can see why actors such as Grant and Depp admire his talents. He can deliver a killer line. Though ostensibly making the case for privacy, Sherborne rarely appeared troubled by providing easy tabloid headlines. He kicked off his dismantling of Vardy’s belief that only getting across “her truth” mattered, by asking, of an interview she gave, “Did you [therefore] feel particularly strongly that the size of [Peter Andre’s] manhood should be made public?” At one point on Thursday, he paused for a while in an examination of the semantics of Vardy’s Whatsapp messages to give due weight to her documented reaction when she discovered that Rooney had blocked her on Instagram. “Wow,” he quoted her saying, in his most clipped tones. “What a cunt”. Sherborne, the son of a criminal QC, educated privately in Hampstead (at the same school as scholarship-boy Dacre), and at Oxford, can play the fusty Rumpole card: “What does FFS stand for?” he enquired of Vardy at one point, aping surprise at the ways of the modern world when she spelt it out. A couple of times, as when Vardy was reduced to tears as she contemplated the self-destructive folly of bringing this case to court, you wondered who, exactly, the more theatrical elements of Sherborne’s performance were for. There is no jury to flatter and amuse. The judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, showed about as much inclination to smile at his punchlines as the Queen faced with Jimmy Carr at the end of an overlong Royal Variety Show. The only straighter face in court belonged to Wayne Rooney, who has so far achieved the admirable feat of staring into middle distance throughout, while deciding whether to button or unbutton his too-tight jacket.

5/14/2022,"The US Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has joined the growing list of US politicians making visits to Kyiv, it emerged on Saturday Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed McConnell’s visit as a powerful signal of bipartisan support for Ukraine. McConnell led a delegation, which included the Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine, John Barrasso of Wyoming and John Cornyn of Texas, to the Ukrainian capital where he was hosted by Zelenskiy at the House of Chimaeras inside the presidential administration compound. In remarks and video posted on Instagram on Saturday, Zelenskiy told the visitors that Ukraine was defending not only itself but all democratic values and freedoms and the right of people to freely choose their own future. “Thank you for your leadership in helping us in our struggle not only for our country, but also for democratic values and freedoms. We really appreciate it,” Zelenskiy said. “Russia is committing genocide against the Ukrainian people,” he added. “[Russia’s President Vladimir Putin] commits war crimes that horrify the whole world – torture, mass executions, rape. Europe has not seen such crimes since World War II.” The visit comes as a $40bn US military aid budget has stalled in the Senate over demands issued by the Kentucky senator Rand Paul for a watchdog to track the spending. In a rare bipartisan request, McConnell and the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, offered Paul a vote on his amendment to the package. That offer was rejected with Paul saying he wanted changes to the underlying bill.",News/US news,Mitch McConnell visits Kyiv with delegation of Republican US senators,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/14/mitch-mcconnell-visits-kyiv-ukraine-republican-senators
5/14/2022,"The Queen’s platinum jubilee is an unprecedented milestone in British history, with the nation geared up for the kind of mass celebrations that, in this country, are only ever witnessed at the end of world wars or to mark a key moment in a monarch’s reign. Now 96, and clearly frail, Elizabeth II remains a highly popular monarch, admired for her work ethic and undramatic moral fibre. When compared to, say, the former King Juan Carlos of Spain, who remains ensconced in a scandal involving $100m of Saudi money, she is also the very model of political rectitude. However, as she nears the end of her reign, her succession remains a cause for concern for monarchists and, contrastingly, hope for republicans, a sector of society that has been all but silenced by the monumental consistency of the Queen’s seven decades as head of state. Even in recent years, with the onset of culture wars and identity struggles, the Queen has managed to remain above the fray, a figure at once remote and ever-present; someone who has appeared to transcend, or at least largely avoid, intersectional conflicts. Yet the fact is the Windsors are a conspicuously white and privileged family, at odds with the new paradigms of diversity and equality. The next monarch may not enjoy the same freedom from social judgment that has been a reliable feature of the current one’s reign. “You could say that the Queen has been a greater bulwark against republicanism as a woman, insofar as she performs the role of mother of the nation, an archetype that people recognise,” says one feminist royal-watcher. “It’s extremely rare for older women to be popular figures, unless their public image is de-sexed.” For women’s rights activist, Shola Mos-Shogbamimu, the Queen isn’t a maternal figure at all. “I think she appeals to an older generation, but she missed a trick with the Sussexes, who connected with people on a personal level of understanding.” If that was a misstep, it’s one of few she’s made. The same cannot be said of her family. A cauldron of bitter divorces and fraternal disputes, it reached a nadir last year when her second son was accused in a civil court of raping a teenager. Prince Andrew denied the claim but the Queen stripped him of the title, His Royal Highness, and he was barred from undertaking public duties. Earlier this year Andrew, who had previously vowed to fight the allegation in court, settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed sum that was reported to be up to £7.5m, on no admission of liability. According to a recent YouGov poll conducted for the anti-monarchy group Republic, 27% of the population supports the abolition of the monarchy, with considerably higher dissatisfaction among the young (a report, Jubilee Britain, produced by the thinktank British Future shows similar results). That’s a notable jump on the 15% that has been the norm for most of this century. Even so, republicanism is the radical dog that has continually failed to bark, particularly in England. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, which seem likely to test the bonds of the union in coming years, a form of republicanism may gain greater momentum. That in turn could have a knock-on effect, but it would require a major upheaval to constitute any genuine threat to the monarchy. As things stand, the only political party in parliament with an official policy of republicanism is the Green party, but that commitment did not reach its last manifesto. The last parliamentary effort to end the constitutional status of the crown was in 1996, with Tony Benn’s doomed Commonwealth of Britain bill. It was sponsored by the then backbench MP Jeremy Corbyn. But when he later became Labour leader, the most he could bring himself to say on the issue was to suggest that the monarchy needed to “improve”. There are republican politicians, but they tend not to make a fuss about it. One is Clive Lewis, Labour MP for Norwich South and former shadow defence secretary who stood for the party leadership in 2020. “I’m a republican with a small r,” he says. “I find it difficult to entertain the notion of being a democratic socialist, a social democrat in some ways, when you have at the heart of your political structure a hereditary multi-billionaire landowner whose children go on to become the head of state. How do you talk about equality? How do you talk about social mobility?” These are questions many people will have asked themselves at some point but most leave it there because they are seen, in the judgment of the former Labour leader George Lansbury, as a “distraction”. It’s almost a century since Lansbury, then an MP, opposed the abolition of the monarchy on the grounds there was more urgent work to be done. And that has remained the progressive understanding ever since. Lewis thinks this strategy has served to sustain the status quo, allowing the “pantomime” of pomp and ceremony to conceal “a whole network of power structures and deference”. Like Lewis, Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, believes the succession will provoke a shift in attitudes. “For most people the monarchy is the Queen and the Queen is the monarchy, and she is fading from view,” he says. “And the alternative – Charles and William – is not particularly compelling.” Since the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936, the royal family has been through any number of sticky patches but owing to a mixture of institutional adaptability and political inertia, as well as the Queen’s personal popularity for most of that period, it has invariably been able to ride out difficulties without them developing into existential threats. Smith, who says Republic has 100,000 supporters on its database, argues this time it’s different. As there has never been a monarch so long in the job, her succession presents unique problems. Moreover, he maintains, young people are increasingly turning away from the idea of an hereditary head of state. “Among 18 to 24 year olds 40% want an elected head of state,” Smith says, which compares with just 37% that want to see the monarchy continue. The problem, says one female observer who has attended Republic meetings, is that the republican movement itself is dominated by “older left-wing, middle-class white people. There is a stirring of republicanism, as we saw in the Caribbean, but the movement with Smith at the helm is about as far away from that kind of spirit as you can get.” The other thing to say about young people is that they often start out with radical political positions, only to abandon them with age and the wilting of youthful ideals. The list of young republicans who end up taking gongs at Buckingham Palace or attending social gatherings at Clarence House is long and ever growing. The rate of political change seldom keeps pace with the idealism of initial promises, and it’s easy to lose enthusiasm and interest as the process lumbers on. It’s 25 years since the first Blair government set out to reform the House of Lords, and there are still hereditary peers, so how long would it take to disentangle the monarch from the mysterious intricacies of Britain’s unwritten constitution? “It would be a huge parliamentary process,” says the constitutional historian Peter Hennessy. “It would be unscrambling literally thousands of years of history. How do you unpick the royal prerogative, because the basis of British government is essentially royal power as transferred to and moderated by the houses of parliament?” And then of course, you arrive at the problem of what would replace the monarchy. A president? “Too many countries have got a presidential monarch under a republic,” says former Labour minister, Denis MacShane, who describes himself as “a republican on balance, even if it’s an unwinnable cause”. He argues that the American, French and Chinese presidents are more like throwbacks to monarchs such as Charles II or George I. “Whereas,” he says, “we have gradually evolved, like the Nordics, into having a completely obedient royal family. They are decorative, no threat to anybody, and so it’s easier to rub along with them than to go through this revolutionary upheaval of fighting for a republic.” MacShane says that he has studied how states are constitutionally organised. “I came to the conclusion that countries that most informed my idea of what I might wish Britain to be like – the Netherlands, Sweden or Norway, what do they all have in common? They have a monarchy.” Smith dismisses these arguments, citing Germany, Ireland and Iceland as nations that function perfectly well with ceremonial presidents who enjoy a limited but important constitutional role. Even in such constrained roles, however, there is the potential for political controversy. Recently the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was declared unwelcome in Kyiv, where he is viewed as a longstanding apologist for Russia. Of course the royals are also not exactly the embodiment of neutrality their supporters like to claim. They are first and foremost couriers of tradition, carrying the weight of familial and national history on their shoulders. The recent PR disaster of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s tour of the Caribbean, which often looked like an homage to colonial jaunts from unenlightened times, shows how that burden can leave the wrong impression. Too many clumsy moves like that and the royal family itself will become the most compelling argument for republicanism. The paradox the monarchy has to finesse is appealing to the conventions of the past as a means of securing a viable future, while trying not to seem stodgily old-fashioned. If it attempts to look too ready to respond to changing mores and fashions, it risks appearing desperate and unspecial. But if it lags too far behind it flirts with embarrassment and irrelevance. The Queen has excelled in finding the right balance, a symbol of continuity subtly adapting to the temper of the times. So it’s no exaggeration to say that republicanism’s great hope lies in the Queen’s death or retirement. One or the other is unavoidably imminent. A seamless transition is the trick Buckingham Palace aims to pull off. But on previous form, Charles is a man with hapless tendencies and the potential to breathe new life into the republican cause. He sees himself as a reformer, and has a track-record of interventionism, not least in “almost singlehandedly destroying modern British architecture for a generation”, as MacShane puts it. These are qualities that give rise to republican optimism. Charles’s arrival on the throne, suggests Lewis, will “open up possibilities for people to talk about what the alternatives are for our future constitution”. “It will be a big game changer,” says Smith. “Big change happens quite quickly when it does happen.” He believes that the chance of William’s son, Prince George, becoming king is “vanishingly small”. All of this, he says, will come as a result of public demands rather than political parties. He cites Brexit as an example of a popular movement that took the establishment by surprise. Yet even that needed the parliamentary threat Ukip appeared to represent to exert pressure on David Cameron to call a referendum. Few politicians will be in a rush to replicate that kind of divisive decision. It has been damaging enough that the country was split along leaver and remainer lines, does anyone have the appetite for a face-off between republicans and monarchists? Outdated, undemocratic, a bizarre anachronism – all these things can be said of the monarchy, but it remains popular, in part because it has been around for so long that no one can quite imagine what the alternative would be.",News/UK news,Bring on the platinum jubilee … but what will happen to Britain’s monarchy in the decades to come?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/14/britain-monarchy-queen-republicans-jubilee
5/14/2022,"In his newly published and excellent book Tiger and Phil: Golf’s Most Fascinating Rivalry, Bob Harig describes the scene in the scoring tent at the conclusion of the 2002 US PGA Championship. That Rich Beem makes no worse than a bogey at the 72nd hole ensures a surprise one-stoke victory over Tiger Woods. Fred Funk looks on, bemused, as Woods bellows: “Yes!” Prompted to clarify his obscure move, Woods states: “That’s Rich Beem one, Phil Mickelson zero.” Lefty remained without a major title. The scale of antipathy between Mickelson and Woods was illustrated by the latter’s strange display of emotion. The intervening years have seen relations soften between golf’s most high-profile player and the individual who for so long was in his shadow. Yet Woods and Mickelson now sit on the opposite sides of golf’s ongoing battle for hearts and minds. Woods, who has created much of his legacy via the PGA Tour, sits in firm endorsement of golf’s existing ecosystem. Mickelson remains far too embroiled in all matters Saudi Arabia. Tiger v Phil, just like old times, but on a basis nobody could have anticipated. Friday evening’s announcement that Mickelson will not defend the US PGA Championship at Southern Hills from Thursday came as a surprise to many. He had crept back into the consciousness of the golf public in recent weeks. Albeit not at all of their doing, it is a blow to the PGA of America. Its reigning champion, a player who won in such dramatic style just weeks short of his 51st birthday, has suffered such a fall from grace subsequently that even turning up at Southern Hills is apparently too much to bear. Twelve months on from being mobbed by adoring galleries, from proving there is sporting life after 50, Mickelson is a pariah. He has not played since infamous remarks relating to Saudi Arabia’s human rights abuses and attempts to leverage the kingdom’s public investment fund against the PGA Tour entered the public domain. Where, at the Masters, Woods’s comeback from a serious car crash understandably dominated the narrative until Scottie Scheffler breezed to victory, the second men’s major of 2022 gives cause to ponder what on earth Mickelson does next. In Tulsa, the reaction of Woods towards his old adversary will be especially interesting. The softer, more human Woods of this day and age may well call for clemency. He has, though, always retained a capacity to seriously wound with even a single sentence. The Saudis so desperately need golfers of status for their disruption plan that they kept Mickelson on board, despite the admission that he knows all about the kingdom’s issues. Mickelson himself neither has the gumption nor the legal mechanism to remove himself entirely from Greg Norman’s equation. Theirs is a marriage of convenience which looks laughably flimsy now. Mickelson has, however, entered for Norman’s LIV Golf Series event in Hertfordshire in June. Should the six-time major champion turn up at the Centurion Club it would provide an element of box office but also an admission Mickelson has given up being a competitive relevance. Golf’s main tours, so opposed to the Saudi scheme, may be happy for Norman to keep talking given the damage incurred by his attempt to brush aside the killing of Jamal Khashoggi and execution of 81 men in Saudi Arabia. Perhaps that recent controversy added to Mickelson’s sense that this US PGA was best avoided. By the time Woods completed his fourth round at Augusta National last month, the scale of physical strain was perfectly clear. Woods has won at Southern Hills before – in the US PGA of 2007 – and warm temperatures will assist him, but he surely remains far too lightly raced to compete over 72 holes. Building towards the Open at St Andrews in July is surely a more legitimate goal. It will be interesting to see whether Scheffler can continue his extraordinary run by way of delivering back-to-back majors. Jordan Spieth needs the US PGA to complete a career grand slam and raved about the venue having visited it in the company of Justin Thomas. “I thought the golf course was fantastic, I loved it,” said Spieth. “I think the green complexes are perfectly fitting to the holes. I think it’s going to be a really firm and fast PGA. I think it’s going to be one of the higher scoring PGAs that we have seen. Now, I did play it in 35mph hour winds with Justin, so I saw the teeth of it and that could change. But it was a great test. I really enjoyed playing it.” The reigning champion will look on from afar while wondering, one assumes, what might have been.

5/14/2022,"For a while it seemed Wasps were heading for a European final for the first time in 15 years. Ultimately it was not to be but the Premiership’s ninth-placed club pushed Lyon right to the wire moments before the hosts could secure their place in the Challenge Cup finale in Marseille on Friday week. With under half an hour to go Wasps were ahead 11-10 thanks to Jimmy Gopperth’s second penalty of the game but a converted try for the 20-year-old replacement hooker Yanis Charcosset and 15 points from fly-half Leo Berdeu, the top scorer in this season’s French Top 14, proved just enough to propel Lyon to the first European final in their history. One or two costly Wasps errors under the high ball and the gathering confidence of the home pack also contributed to the outcome, with the visitors left to regret their strike rate in the opposing 22. A last-gasp turnover in the third quarter, in particular, denied Wasps a seemingly inevitable try and a 75th-minute converted score for Jimmy Gopperth proved too little too late. Whether it was the heat or just the marked improvement in Lyon’s performance that ultimately made the difference in the second half, Wasps could not always sustain their early promise. Initially they had looked the more alert side and their scrum was also making decent headway. Defensively Wasps were also making a nuisance of themselves with Jack Willis prominent at the breakdown and they deserved to open the scoring through Dan Robson, the scrum-half catching the Lyon defence unawares to snipe over following a close-range lineout. A sweeping team score, finished by Berdeu, gave Lyon some encouragement, however, and Charcosset’s second-half score from close range left Wasps to play catch up. They had previously beaten both Biarritz and Edinburgh in thrilling finishes away from home but Pierre Mignoni’s side had enough power in reserve on the bench to rise above Gopperth’s late thrust",Sport/Sport,Berdeu’s boot ensures Lyon hold off Wasps to reach Challenge Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/14/lyon-wasps-european-challenge-cup-rugby-union-match-report
5/14/2022,"Marwa al-Sabouni is a Syrian architect and writer. Born in Homs in 1981, she was living in the city when the civil war broke out in 2011 and remained there with her young family throughout the worst bombardments. In her memoir The Battle for Home, published in 2016, al-Sabouni wrote about the vital role that architecture plays in the functioning of society and how Syria’s future could be shaped by its built environment. In 2021, she published a second book, Building for Hope: Towards an Architecture of Belonging. Al-Sabouni is guest co-director of this year’s Brighton festival, which runs until 29 May. Belfast (Dir Kenneth Branagh, 2021) I watched this at home recently – there are no cinemas in Homs. It’s a film about war and love and friendship, about difficult decisions in a time of crisis. I liked the story and how real the actors made it, but also the way it handled the theme of home, which I very much related to – how the family was torn between staying and leaving. The whole dilemma of what to do, and how different people deal with similar questions and end up with different answers, was explored so well. It’s a great movie. The Buried Giant by Kazuo Ishiguro This is a story set in a fictional version of England many centuries ago. It’s about grudges, and Ishiguro writes about this without naming the feeling, creating a fictional creature – the buried giant – for it as a reference. It’s also about a family’s journey to discover this feeling, and to find a way towards forgiveness. What I loved about this story is the indirect and imaginative way it has of dealing with hidden feelings that we bury deep down in our psyche, and how to access them. Homs Equestrian Club I don’t go out much to busy places, and because of the war we don’t have many places to go. But I do go and ride every day at the equestrian club in Homs. My horse is called Salah al-Din. He’s a very strong horse from a special breed – Syrian Arab horses are among the best in the world for strength, endurance and performance. They are really smart animals and very independent and spirited, which is a humbling experience on a daily basis. The social aspect of the club is disastrous; it’s all about the horses. The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey (Apple TV+) Samuel L Jackson gives a phenomenal performance in this TV series. He plays an old man suffering from dementia who takes an experimental medicine that gains him a few days of lucidity. He uses those precious moments to access his memories and explain to himself the nightmares he had, which are related to racism. The show deals with different questions with great sensitivity, and in the end it’s about true friendship and genuine feelings. For me, it’s the story of the human mind and how precious this gift is. Georges Wassouf Georges Wassouf is from a rural area near Homs, but his career took off from Beirut. I just love his music – he has a poignant way of speaking about love and a fantastic way of bending the lyrics to express the music. It’s also lovely how his artistic character is so closely related to his real-life character. He’s a very accessible figure who lives among his people, and he didn’t change his lifestyle in a way that would separate him from his own small village. Ahla Ayam El Omr, which translates as Life’s Most Beautiful Days, is one of my favourite of his songs. Naranj, Damascus Homs restaurants are rubbish, but there are plenty of good ones in Damascus. The one that I really like is Naranj, in the old part of the city where the Muslim and the Christian quarters merge. The food is great and the menu is very much based on what’s in season.

5/14/2022,"There are a couple of old iPods in my desk drawer still, tangled up with cables that will definitely come in useful one day. One is a Shuffle that I clipped to my T-shirt during a brief attempt to have a jogging phase. The other is a scuffed, black, fifth-generation iPod. If I charge it for hours, it plays for a few songs before the screen dissolves and if you press the wheel in a way it doesn’t like, the screen freezes completely. It is a frozen object in other ways, too, capturing life at a certain time, in playlists called things such as Dip It Low!! and Happy Birthday Matt 7. Last week, after just over 20 years, it was announced that the iPod was going to be discontinued; when the last remaining iPod Touches have sold out, there will be no more. “[It] redefined how music is discovered, listened to and shared,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, wheeled out for the quote to accompany the announcement. Given the sorry state of the music industry for anyone not at the very top of it, I’m not sure that is something to be proud of entirely, but of course it redefined music. As the iPod’s capacity grew, from 5GB to 160GB, it put vast choice in our pockets and made it portable. You could settle on almost any of the iPod’s innovations and see it as a turning point in how music became something we talked about consuming rather than listening to, but I keep thinking about that element of choice. It is a luxurious position to be in, I know, but two decades later I often feel stifled by choice, not just when it comes to music but with all entertainment. It is easy to throw away time on choosing which TV series to watch on a streaming service, for example, and more often than I would like to admit, I will scroll, fidgety at the possibilities, before not choosing anything at all and going to bed with a book. It’s the same with podcasts, with films and, of course, with music. How can anyone settle when there is so much to choose from, all the time? Choosing has become a pointless activity in its own right. As is often the way with the death of a device, there has been a wave of nostalgia for the iPod, just as people fondly thought of the passing of the BlackBerry and its tiny, intricate keyboard from the perspective of an era in which we idly tap a screen twice to send a lengthy voice note. I felt it too. I am nostalgic for what might have been the perfect balance of choice: just enough for the possibilities to seem endless, without them actually being so. The dust has settled on the announcement that 29-year-old Ncuti Gatwa, of Sex Education fame, will take over from Jodie Whittaker as the latest Doctor in Doctor Who. (Fan forums are already buzzing with theories about the exact wording of the announcement, which made no reference to Gatwa being the 14th Doctor, as would be numerically correct. There are suggestions that he might be the new Doctor, but not the next Doctor, which is the sort of twistiness that gives Doctor Who a reputation for being confusing.) The broad consensus is that this is a very good choice and Gatwa certainly has the fizzy energy that the role seems to require; as Eric in Sex Education, he has been a revelation. The announcement arrived on social media, just before last Sunday’s Baftas. Gatwa and returning boss Russell T Davies shared an image of two hearts and a blue box on Instagram and then the news just sort of appeared. Considering the fanfare that previous new Doctors have been given for their arrivals (Peter Capaldi got a whole live event on BBC One, Whittaker a trailer at the end of the Wimbledon men’s finals), why was this so low key? In March, the Hollywood Reporter published story about a gruelling audition process taking place to find the lead for a much-discussed, eagerly awaited Madonna biopic. Given the recent successes of films about Elton John, Freddie Mercury and Aretha Franklin, to name just a few, of course there should be one about Madonna, though this being Madonna, she is cowriting and directing it and if the auditions are as hardcore as they sound, it would be unsurprising if she ends up starring as her younger self too. According to the report, the film will climax with her Blond Ambition tour, still one of the greatest pop shows of all time. In 1990, Pope John Paul II disagreed, urging people to boycott “one of the most satanic shows in the history of humanity”, which did somewhat up the ante in terms of career-best reviews. Last week, Madonna tweeted at Pope Francis, requesting a meeting “to discuss some important matters”. She said she had been excommunicated three times. “It doesn’t seem fair,” added the woman who appeared on stage in Rome on a crucifix in 2006, to the dismay of another Pope Benedict XVI. It is hard to verify an excommunication, though there is no doubt that she has riled popes over the years. Arguing the fairness of excommunication with the current pontiff in the same week as she releases an NFT triptych of digital art involving nudity and trees and butterflies coming from intimate places makes me think that it’s a shame the biopic will end in 1990.

5/14/2022,"It seems a modest little story at first, a cinematic wallflower content to cling to the corners of its tight, boxed-in aspect ratio, rather than thrust itself on to the audience. But while The Quiet Girl, Colm Bairéad’s multi-award-winning Irish-language drama, might be small in scale, it’s one of the most exquisitely realised films of the year. There’s a kinship with Céline Sciamma’s Petite Maman in the crystalline delicacy of the storytelling and the way it plays on the heartstrings like a harp. It also calls to mind the earliest work of Lynne Ramsay – her first feature, Ratcatcher, and short film Gasman – in the way Kate McCullough’s curious camera latches on to the small details that are magnified in the eyes of a child. The quiet girl is Cáit (the remarkable Catherine Clinch), one of an ever-expanding brood of neglected kids on an impoverished smallholding in early-80s rural Ireland. With her mother expecting yet another baby, and her father skulking sullenly in the background like an unspoken threat, Cáit is sent to stay with distant relatives: warm, wise Eibhlín (Carrie Crowley) wraps her in love immediately; Seán (Andrew Bennett) is taciturn and reserved but no less bonded to the child. Under their care, Cáit blossoms. “All you needed was some minding,” says Eibhlín. It’s an accomplished work from first-time feature director Bairéad, who, appropriately, has the knack of telling us everything we need to know without words: a tense momentary standoff over some sticks of rhubarb, for example, is more eloquent than pages of dialogue could ever be.",Arts/Film,The Quiet Girl review – exquisite debut drama set in rural Ireland,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/14/the-quiet-girl-review-colm-bairead-catherine-clinch-exquisite-irish-language-drama

The woman was walking three golden retrievers when the incident happened. A 26-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and taken into custody. According to police, officers were called to Cheyne Walk in Chelsea just before 6.30am on Saturday to reports of a collision involving a pedestrian, animals and an Audi car. The woman was found dead at the scene, while all three dogs also died as a result of injuries, police said. The driver of the Audi was found with minor injuries. A forensic tent has been pitched on Cheyne Walk, a mansion-lined road that stretches along the River Thames. The Met said: “Officers attended along with paramedics from London ambulance service. “Police were called to Cheyne Walk, SW3, to reports of a collision involving a car, a woman and three dogs. A 41-year-old woman was found dead at the scene.

5/14/2022,"The leak of a draft supreme court opinion on abortion rights has turned the body into a place “where you look over your shoulder”, the conservative justice Clarence Thomas said on Friday, adding that the reputation of the “fragile” institution may have been permanently damaged by the breach. The opinion suggests the court is poised to strike down a constitutional right to abortion provided by Roe v Wade nearly 50 years ago, and has caused social rifts over the issue to deepen, with nationwide protests to the draft decision expected across US cities on Saturday. “What happened at the court was tremendously bad,” Thomas, 73, said in a dialog at a conference of conservative and libertarian thinkers in Dallas. “I wonder how long we’re going to have these institutions at the rate we’re undermining them,” he added. “And then I wonder when they’re gone or destabilized, what we’re going to have as a country.” The comments came one week after the justice said he feared that the judicial system will come under threat if people are unwilling to “live with outcomes we don’t agree with” and that recent events at the apex court might be “one symptom of that”. But Thomas’s comments made before a gathering sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute, the Manhattan Institute and the Hoover Institution, went further as he spoke directly to the leak. Thomas said it was beyond “anyone’s imagination” before the 2 May leak of the opinion that even a line of a draft opinion would be released in advance, much less an entire draft that runs nearly 100 pages. “The institution that I’m a part of – if someone said that one line of one opinion would be leaked by anyone, you would say, ‘Oh, that’s impossible. No one would ever do that,’” he said. “There’s such a belief in the rule of law, belief in the court, belief in what we’re doing, that that was verboten.” The anti-abortion justice continued: “And look where we are, where now that trust or that belief is gone forever. And when you lose that trust, especially in the institution that I’m in, it changes the institution fundamentally. You begin to look over your shoulder. It’s like kind of an infidelity, that you can explain it, but you can’t undo it.” Thomas’s comments speak to a split in opinion over the breach, with conservatives drawing attention to the leak itself and liberals focusing on the content of the 83-page document. “Anybody who would, for example, have an attitude to leak documents, that general attitude is your future on the bench,” Thomas said. “And you need to be concerned about that. And we never had that before. We actually trusted – we might have been a dysfunctional family, but we’re a family.” Asked if respect for ideological differences could be fostered in Congress and in the public arena, Thomas said: “Well, I’m just worried about keeping it at the court now,” he said before praising his former colleagues on the bench. “This is not the court of that era,” he said. The justice also spoke to protests at conservative justices’ homes in Maryland and Virginia, saying that conservatives have never act that way. “You would never visit supreme court justices’ houses when things didn’t go our way. We didn’t throw temper tantrums. I think it is ... incumbent on us to always act appropriately and not to repay tit for tat,” he said. The court has said the draft does not represent the final position of any of the court’s members, and Chief Justice John Roberts has ordered an investigation into the leak with a focus placed on a relatively small group of law clerks with access to draft opinions.",News/US news,Clarence Thomas calls leak of supreme court abortion draft ‘tremendously bad’,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/may/14/clarence-thomas-supreme-court-leak-abortion
5/14/2022,"The west must not backslide into aiding the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, or it will hand victory to an autocratic alliance led by Vladimir Putin and weaken the democratic cause in Europe and Venezuela, the country’s deputy foreign minister, Isadora Zubillaga, has warned. A delegation of Venezuelan opposition politicians have been touring Europe in an attempt to reassure the west that despite recent divisions and setbacks, they have a viable strategy to secure new presidential elections. Supporters of the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, claim the presidential elections in 2018 were fraudulent, a position adopted by the US and UK. The last attempt at talks between supporters of Guaidó and supporters of Maduro, brokered by Norwegian officials, ended in October when the government withdrew after a high-profile Maduro adviser, Alex Saab, was extradited to the US to face charges of alleged money laundering. There is now pressure from civil society groups for talks to restart, even though direct support for Guaidó has faded. The UK still recognises Guaidó as the interim constitutional president. Zubillaga said: “We want to return to the negotiating table because that is the way we can effectively and intelligently get out of the crisis and gridlock. Those talks need to produce a timetable for early presidential elections before 2024. There has to be an agreement on a process of reconciliation and a peaceful path between the two parts of Venezuela. “The reality is that we must talk. We were not able to wipe them out and they were not able to wipe us out either, that negotiation process must include discussion of the lifting of sanctions and penalties.” But Zubillaga warned the US not to help Maduro by lifting sanctions without clear progress in the talks on elections. Zubillaga said: “The Maduro regime is sustained by the international alliance, including countries like Iran, Russia, Cuba and China. If Maduro is helped, so is Putin. “Venezuela is no better than Russia. We have hundreds of political prisoners. We have 15,000 people investigated for political reasons, most of them kids. We have money laundering. We have an autocratic press, and as many as 7 million out of a population of 30 million in exile, including 2 million in Colombia.” A member of the opposition negotiating team, Mariela Magallanes, said: “There has to be a political process to fix this crisis. The Mexico City process is on pause, but not because of us. There has to be a democratic transition. It is not easy because we have tried many possibilities. We have to connect with civil society to create the pressure for the talks. There is a window of opportunity with the current crisis in Ukraine to force Maduro to negotiate.” Guaidó supporters were alarmed on 5 March when members of the Biden administration opened talks with the Maduro regime to see if the dilapidated Venezuelan oil industry could provide additional oil to the market to drive down prices. It was the first contact with the Maduro team since Biden came to office. Magallenes said: “You don’t trade oil for democracy. You don’t trade with these regimes thinking they will be closer to you, because they won’t. Nothing must be traded for freedom.” She also called for greater coordination between the US and Europe on sanctions, saying the US has imposed sanctions on more than 150 people and the EU only 50. “It means that you can buy a property in Spain, open a bank account in Italy or send your children to school in Germany. It has to be coordinated and consistent.”",News/World news,"West must not lift sanctions on Maduro, says Venezuelan opposition",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/west-must-not-lift-sanctions-on-maduro-says-venezuelan-opposition
