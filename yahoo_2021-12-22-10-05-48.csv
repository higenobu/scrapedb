But its track record isn't great.,Business/Investor's Business Daily•2 days ago,Bank Of America Names Top 11 Stock Picks For 2022,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/08fc58c1-4342-3ae8-87a3-fef60d9344d3/bank-of-america-names-top-11.html
12/22/2021,"With less than two weeks remaining in 2021, the major Wall Street firms and analysts have pulled out their crystal balls to peer through the curtains at what awaits for 2022. It’s an annual habit, and one that investors pay close attention to; while the forecasts are not always perfect, they do give a fair perspective of marketing terrain. According to investment banking firm Raymond James, there are going to be plenty of opportunities in the year ahead. The firm's stock analysts have been busy picking the equities they see as winners in 2022. These are Strong Buy choices, and not just from Raymond James – the Street generally agrees. We’ve used the TipRanks platform to pull up the details on three of these Raymond James picks, stocks which the firm sees with 50% upside in the coming year – or better. EngageSmart (ESMT) The first stock on Raymond James' radar is EngageSmart, a customer engagement and integrated payment software provider, offering solutions and subscriptions on the Software-as-a-Service model. The company’s solutions ease the path for business and enterprise customers, improving appointment scheduling, bill payment, and other common processes for more profitable operations. EngageSmart boasts that it has empowered over 74,000 small- and medium-sized business, and over 3,000 enterprise clients. This is a new company in the public markets – it held its IPO at the end of September this year. In the event, EngageSmart upsized the offering, putting 14.6 million shares on the market instead of 13 million originally planned, and pricing them at $26 each, above the expected $23 to $25 range. The IPO raised in excess of $378 million in gross proceeds, above the $338 million forecast. The IPO was followed in November by the company’s first financial release as a public entity. EngageSmart reported a solid gain in revenues, along with a deepening loss in earnings. At the top line, revenue came in at $55.5 million, up 42% from the previous year, while at the bottom line, the EPS loss of 6 cents was worse than the year-ago quarter’s break-even. In several other important metrics, the company showed additional gains. Gross profits rose year-over-year, from $29.5 million to $41.3 million, and reflecting the success of the IPO, the company’s cash holdings increased from $29.4 million at the end of last year to $253.8 million at the end of 3Q21. The company’s total customer rose by 40% yoy, to 77,400, and the total transactions processed also grew 40%, to reach 28.6 million. All in all, it’s a picture of a fast-growing tech company. At the same time, ESMT shares fell sharply, starting on the November 10 date of the earnings release. Raymond James analyst John Davis is blunt in his assessment of that development, writing: “We believe the severe stock reaction is largely due to technical factors coupled with general weakness of high growth fintech/software peers and recent IPO’s, rather than any true fundamental concerns, and as such think it has created a tremendous buying opportunity.” Davis goes on to outline some of the positives here: “ESMT has a first/early mover advantage and product leadership that puts the company in pole position to capture share, driving 30%+ growth for the foreseeable future. More importantly, we believe there is a convincing bull case given tailwinds in both SMB (pricing + new specialties) and Enterprise (bill pay 2.0) that could result in material upside... While the 3Q top line may have modestly missed bulls’ lofty expectations, we think the potential for significant out year estimate revisions is little changed.” In line with these bullish comments, Davis gives ESMT a Strong Buy rating, and a $40 price target to suggest a one-year upside potential of ~84%. (To watch Davis’ track record, click here) ESMT gets another Strong Buy from the analyst consensus view, based on 8 recent Buy ratings and 2 Holds. The shares are priced at $21.47 and their average price target of $36.89 implies ~72% upside from that level. (See ESMT stock analysis on TipRanks) UserTesting (USER) Next up is another tech company – but one in a truly unique niche. UserTesting is a human insights platform, offering its customers a ‘user eye’ view of how their software performs. UserTesting’s platform allows customers to receive video of their users, using products. The product brings a powerful perspective to developers, who can see how end-users interact with apps and react to designs and processes, concepts and brands. By the end of 3Q21, UserTesting boasted more than 2,100 customers in over 50 countries – a customer base that includes more than half of the world’s most valuable brand names. This growth, and the rising stock markets of the past year, supported an IPO, which was held in November. The USER ticker debuted on Wall Street on November 17 with 10 million shares put on the market at $14 each. The IPO raised $140 million in gross proceeds. After the IPO, shares began to fall, and have so far failed to recover. The stock is down 35% since it hit the market. Looking at the situation from Raymond James, 5-star analyst Brian Peterson acknowledges this reverse, but sees the stock still in a sound position for future growth. “We think the secular shift toward technology-enabled methods of market research and customer analytics are creating a number of new software categories, leading to substantial spend opportunities for a number of software vendors. USER should be a prime beneficiary of this dynamic, given that it’s video-oriented platform can often provide more human insights than other data/survey focused applications. While the market remains early in its adoption curve, we believe the quick time to value for customers vs. legacy approaches should allow USER to deliver 30% growth for the foreseeable future,” Peterson opined. These comments support a Strong Buy rating from Peterson, and his $14 price target shows in confidence in an upside of 68%. (To watch Peterson’s track record, click here) It’s clear from the Wall Street reaction that UserTesting has more fans than just the Raymond James analyst; it has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 11 positive reviews. The stock is currently price at $8.31 and has a $13.70 average price target, for ~65% one-year upside potential. (See USER stock analysis on TipRanks) Dave & Buster’s Entertainment (PLAY) We started our list with two tech stocks, and we’ll finish it up with a shift in focus, to entertainment and leisure. Dave & Buster’s is a well-known chain of venues, featuring a combination of full-service restaurant and bar seating and menus with high-end video arcades featuring the latest games. It’s an amusement center for grown-ups, who still have a connection to their inner child – and it has proven successful. The chain has 143 stores, in the US and Canada; its most recent location opened in the third quarter of this year. Dave & Buster’s boasts that, during 3Q21, it had recouped its losses from the pandemic shutdowns of 2020. Despite the strong rebound from last year, sales in Q3 were down slightly from Q2. The quarterly revenue of $317.9 million was down 16% sequentially. Looking back to 2019, however, at the last pre-pandemic Q3, the current report fares better – 3Q21 showed revenues up 5.6% from the pre-pandemic 3Q19. This raises the possibility that the sequential fall was due to an artifact of the rebound, and a surge of customers as soon as businesses reopened, rather than a lack of popularity or declining business. Earnings were also solid. EPS for the quarter was 21 cents per share; this compares favorably to the $1.01 net loss per share in 3Q20 and the slim 2-cent per share profit in 3Q19. In his coverage for Raymond James, analyst Brian Vaccaro notes D&B’s sound performance, and makes the case that the stock’s current underperformance relative to the broader market. ""Simply put, we believe PLAY shares are materially undervalued at an EV/EBITDA in the mid-5’s given 1) a path towards higher margins (200-300 bp) and EBITDA($~400M vs. $316M) in ‘22 vs. ‘19, 2) accelerating unit growth in ‘22 (mid-SD %) and beyond (strong ROI’s bolstered by smaller prototype), and 3) its much improved B/S (potential to refi HY notes in ‘22) and liquidity position that could allow the company to opportunistically buy back stock through ‘22 (new $100M repo authorization),"" Vaccaro explained. To this end, Vaccaro rates PLAY as a Strong Buy, and his $55 price target implies a one-year upside of ~53%. (To watch Vaccaro’s track record, click here) Once again, we’re looking at a stock with a Strong Buy from the Street as well as Raymond James. PLAY shares have 9 reviews, breaking down 7 to 2 in favor of Buy over Hold. The average price target of $50.43 suggests an upside of 40% from the trading price of $35.95.

12/22/2021,"With the S&P 500 Index only slightly below its all-time high, bargains are getting harder to find. If you want to go after the hottest tickers, prepare to pay a pretty penny for them. But not every stock with potential is shooting through the roof. Goldman Sachs recently issued “buy” ratings on several stocks that definitely haven’t been market darlings this year. Here are three companies Goldman considers hidden gems — plus another little-known opportunity outside the stock market. This cloud communications platform helps software developers interact with users through embedded features like text chat, phone calls and video calls. The company was founded in 2008 and today has more than 250,000 active customer accounts. Business is growing rapidly. In Q3, revenue increased 65% year-over-year to $740.2 million. For Q4, management expects revenue to be in the range of $760 million to $770 million. And yet the stock hasn’t been a market favorite. Year-to-date, Twilio shares tumbled 27.7%, compared with the S&P 500 Index’s 24.9% gain in the same period. Goldman jumped on Twilio last week, with a price target of $350 — about 36% worth of upside from current levels. Granted, Twilio still isn’t the cheapest pickup, as it trades at over $250 apiece. But you can own a smaller piece of the company using a popular app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend. After the stock market’s impressive climb over the past year and a half, many companies are trading above their pre-pandemic levels. Not Boeing, though. While the company’s share price has doubled since the March 2020 lows, it’s still well below where it stood before COVID. Boeing is one of the leading players in the aircraft manufacturing business, and investors have been sensibly concerned about whether airlines will bother to buy new planes as the pandemic continues to suppress the travel industry. But things have improved, according to the latest earnings report. In Q3, revenue rose 8% from a year ago to $15.3 billion. The company had a commercial airplanes backlog of $290 billion at the end of September. Goldman has set a price target of $305. Since Boeing currently trades at just $190, the Wall Street giant is projecting a potential upside of over 60%. Since FedEx’s delivery service is an essential part of many e-commerce businesses, one would expect the stock to thrive in this day and age. And although FedEx shares did have an impressive rally earlier this year, they have pulled back since. In fact, over the past 12 months, the stock has slipped 13.2%. But Goldman remains bullish. On Dec. 17, the investment bank reiterated its buy rating on FedEx and set a $343 target, representing roughly 35% upside from current prices. The company reported earnings last week. The report shows that in the three months ended Nov. 30, FedEx generated $23.5 billion of revenue, up 14% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings came in at $4.83 per share, unchanged from a year earlier. The stock’s curious slide reinforces just how hard it is to predict winners and losers. If you don't want to gamble on individual stocks right now, you can always build a diversified portfolio of blue-chip stocks just by using your “spare change.” When looking for opportunities, never forget that stocks can be highly volatile, and Wall Street experts don’t always make the right predictions. If you want to invest in something with big potential that’s also insulated from the ups and downs of the stock market, consider this overlooked asset: fine art. Contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% during the same period, according to the Citi Global Art Market Chart. Artwork is becoming a popular way to diversify because it's a ""real"" physical asset with little correlation to the stock market, much like precious metals or real estate. On a scale of -1 to +1 (with 0 representing no link at all), Citi found the correlation between contemporary art and the S&P 500 was just 0.12 over the past 25 years. It’s true that investing in fine art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultra-rich. But with a new investing platform, you can invest in iconic artworks too, just like Jeff Bezos and Peggy Guggenheim. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

12/22/2021,"(Bloomberg) -- Cruise LLC Chief Executive Officer Dan Ammann had a slate of meetings on Dec. 16 when he got an early afternoon call from General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra. She told Ammann he was being dismissed from the robotaxi startup that GM controls through a majority stake, say people familiar with the events. Most Read from Bloomberg FDA Expected to Authorize Pfizer and Merck Covid Pills This Week Moderna’s Third Dose Boosts Antibodies Against Omicron Omicron Becomes Dominant U.S. Strain With 73% of Covid Cases Extreme Bidding Wars Are Raging in One of World’s Riskiest Housing Markets Israel to Offer Fourth Shots; N.Y. Cancels Exams: Virus Update What seemed abrupt to outsiders and people working at Cruise had been building for months. The two executives didn’t agree on how to focus the breakthrough self-driving technology that the Silicon Valley unit is preparing to launch with a taxi service. Barra and GM’s board were pushing a grand vision that included transferring that knowledge to create luxury Cadillacs, self-driving cars sold at retail or delivery vehicles for GM’s new electric-van business. The opportunities, and their potential value, were immense. Ammann -- a star in his own right who once competed with Barra to run GM -- was open to all of those things eventually, but he disagreed on some key points. First, he thought Cruise needed to focus on starting its taxi business before spreading its resources. Second, he wanted Barra and GM’s board to take Cruise public sooner rather than later, giving it stock to lure the rare talent that can program cars to drive themselves, said two people familiar with his thinking. Ultimately, the dispute was about control: In the vision shared by Barra and the board, keeping Cruise in-house gave GM both a high-margin robotaxi business and more direct access to the company’s resources to make other autonomous vehicles and services. Cruise could also enhance GM’s own assisted-driving features. People didn’t think the collaboration was smooth enough. If Ammann prevailed, there would be the further complication of public stakeholders in a new company to consider, not just the strategic interest and shareholder value of GM. Ammann, 49, discovered the hard way that Barra and her board call the shots, even though Cruise is legally a separate entity with other private shareholders besides GM. When he didn’t fall in line with that vision, it was over. How it all went down is instructive to how Cruise will be an integral part of GM and how it will probably be managed when Barra finds a new CEO. Rivals for CEO The split is an end to a long relationship between Barra and Ammann, who were the finalists for the top job at GM when Dan Akerson was looking for his replacement before retiring in 2014. Before GM’s board decided on Barra, the two candidates approached the directors and said that whoever didn’t get the top job would stay and work with the new CEO, said several people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named. Afterward, they worked in lockstep when cutting weak businesses and acquiring Cruise. In recent months, the pair of executives started to see more and more aspects of Cruise differently, the people said. If Ammann wanted, for example, to expand robotaxi services to other cities after San Francisco, did he need GM approval to start laying that groundwork? More and more, the answer was “yes” and GM was exerting its influence over the startup. Ammann reported to a Cruise board that is chaired by Barra and included Cruise founder and now-interim CEO Kyle Vogt. Other GM brass on Cruise’s board included President Mark Reuss, product development chief Doug Parks, general counsel Craig Glidden and GM director Devin Wenig. Former Alphabet Inc. executive Regina Dugan, the CEO of non-profit Wellcome Leap, also has a seat. Softbank Vision Fund and Honda Motor Co. have non-voting observer status on the board. They were consulted about the management change and didn’t object, two of the people said. Tensions Arise It was a quick fall for Ammann, who didn’t return a phone call or email seeking comment. Ammann had a starring role in October at GM’s investor day, when Barra made a case that GM could double revenue to $280 billion by 2030. He laid out how the company would start its self-driving taxi business soon and grow revenue to $50 billion in the next seven years. Margins could be 40%. Tension had been building for some time but the drama started amping up after a Cruise board meeting on Nov. 2. That’s when Barra made it clear that Cruise’s mission, in addition to its taxi business, was to develop technology for GM and create value for its shareholders. An IPO was not in the offing. Even though Ammann wasn’t completely aligned with that vision, Barra left the meeting feeling that the matter was settled, two of the people said. Cruise’s technology would serve as a platform for GM autonomous vehicles and services the same way the Ultium battery serves as a platform for many electric cars and the Ultifi software system will provide different connected services for GM vehicle owners. GM has been pressured by investors to spin out Ultium as a separate business, which Barra doesn’t want. After the November meeting, Ammann continued to try to make his case for an IPO and to have a bigger hand in deciding where the company would focus its resources. He was certainly willing to work on other projects with GM, but stressed the importance of letting his robotaxi plans remain the priority, which would push out the timing of other self-driving applications, two of the people said. Conversations were tense and leaders at GM felt collaboration was too challenging with Ammann in charge, they said. Ammann was still in the job after GM’s board meeting on Dec. 7. It was after that when Barra made the decision, consulting with both boards before make the move, two of the people said. Amman’s Dismissal In a sign of the inner turmoil, GM initially put out a press release at 4 p.m. Dec. 16 before quickly pulling it off the internet while Barra addressed Cruise’s staff. Vogt, Cruise’s founder, chief technical officer and now acting CEO, put Barra on speaker phone. He thanked Ammann for his service and Barra told Cruise managers that GM remained committed to the mission of developing self-driving cars. She said the company would find a first-rate CEO and that the company was special and deserved a special leader, two of the people said. One idea that had been floated was to make Vogt the CEO. He refused. Then there was a discussion about making Cruise’s Chief Operating Officer Gil West either CEO or co-CEO with Vogt. West, who had joined the company in January after leaving Delta Air Lines, also declined, two of the people said. He said it would be best if Vogt led the company that he founded. When the full press release was eventually circulated, it was devoid of any praise for Ammann: “General Motors Co. announced today that Dan Ammann, Chief Executive Officer of Cruise, is leaving the company. Kyle Vogt, Cruise President and Chief Technical Officer, will serve as interim CEO.” By contrast, when former Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara left GM for financial-technology startup Stripe, Barra lavished her with praise. The news didn’t sit well with investors. GM’s stock price fell 5.5% on Dec. 17, more than the day’s drop in the broader markets, and declined another 2.8% as of 9:44 a.m. Monday in New York. “What I really want the investor community to know is that Cruise and GM are totally aligned on accelerating the joint autonomous-vehicle strategy we outlined on our last Investor Day,” Reuss, the automaker’s president, said in a Dec. 17 interview on Bloomberg TV. Decade at GM It’s an ignominious end for Ammann’s decade of work at GM. He was part of Morgan Stanley’s restructuring and IPO team and later joined the automaker as treasurer. He climbed to chief financial officer before being named president on the same day Barra was promoted to CEO. He played a big role in downsizing GM’s money-losing overseas operations, including Opel in Europe. That global restructuring has been a hallmark of Barra’s tenure and a big reason the company has grown profits. Ammann was central in buying Cruise, and Barra sent him to run it two years ago. The self-driving taxi startup has applied for permission from the California Public Utilities Commission to start charging for rides in autonomous vehicles that have no safety driver. Cruise also plans to launch a service in Dubai in 2023. Under Ammann, Cruise raised more than $6 billion from partners Microsoft Corp., T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Honda and SoftBank Vision Fund. Those cash-raising rounds brought Cruise a valuation of more than $30 billion. When Barra sent Ammann to Cruise, the company gave him a compensation package that provided incentive to sell the company or execute an IPO. Ammann stood to get an estimated $25.6 million in restricted stock if Cruise was sold or went public, and he’d get 101,000 warrants in the self-driving startup. That showed that GM’s board wanted an IPO at some point, but nothing very soon. When asked about taking Cruise public on the company’s third-quarter earnings call, Barra was non-committal and said the close relationship was an advantage. With Cruise, “the vertical integration with GM is a key differentiator,” Barra said. “The message on Cruise is we’re well-funded and we have rapid commercialization plans in front of us, and that’s the play we’re executing. And over the longer term, the board will look at what best enhances the overall value creation and shareholder value for the GM shareholder.” (Updates with quote from GM President Reuss and GM share trading) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek How to Run a Business With Friends Without Killing the Friendship What Is Company Culture If You Don’t Have an Office?

12/22/2021,"The Turkish lira’s wild ride continued with a leap of as much as 43% against the U.S. dollar late Monday and early Tuesday, following President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s unveiling of a new plan for supporting the currency. Erdogan is largely responsible for the crisis afflicting the lira. Despite inflation running at over 20%, the president is bucking conventional economic wisdom by insisting that low interest rates are the way out of the predicament, and has sacked a succession of central bank governors who believed otherwise and would not cut rates. Successive rate cuts pushed by Erdogan have led traders to abandon the lira, which had by late Monday lost nearly 60% of its value against the dollar this year. A 15% one-day drop against the dollar in late November was so drastic that gadget maker Apple suspended online sales there; when they resumed, prices were up 25%. On Monday, days after yet another rate cut at a time when central banks around the world are doing the opposite—and a 50% hike in Turkey’s minimum wage—Erdogan turned up the chaos dial. First, he said he would continue the cuts, claiming he was basing his policy on Islam’s prohibition of unreasonably high interest rates. He also laid into the prominent TÜSİAD business group, which had on Saturday called for a return to the “established rules of economic science.” According to Erdogan, the organization “cannot interfere in what we are doing.” Erdogan claimed he will get Turkey’s inflation down to 4%. That episode knocked the lira by over 10%, sending it to a new record low of 18.4 to the dollar. Then, after local markets closed, Erdogan unveiled a plan aimed at tempting Turks away from holding their savings in dollars rather than lira: He said the government would guarantee lira deposits against foreign-exchange depreciation that exceeds the deposit rate, though details of how it will do this remain scarce. “We are presenting a new financial alternative to citizens who want to alleviate their concerns stemming from the rise in exchange rates when they evaluate their savings,” the president said. And up went the lira, closing Monday with a 25% jump. On Tuesday morning, the lira leapt again by 20% against the dollar. Then it fell by 20%, before rising again by as much as 12%. At the time of publication, it had fallen again slightly, with a current exchange rate of around 13 lira to the dollar. Erdogan’s late-Monday move should stave off a bank run for the time being, wrote Timothy Ash, a BlueBay Asset Management economist, in a Tuesday blog post. He also noted that Erdogan, who has avoided capital controls, had “affirmed he believes in markets.” However, Ash warned, the program would probably still end up proving inflationary. “This scheme likely has bought time and avoided an immediate crash in the banking sector, but it has done nothing to fight inflation, will further extend Erdogan’s unorthodox interest rate policy, and likely puts off early elections and increases the chances of an Erdogan win [in Turkey’s scheduled 2023 election],” Ash wrote. “Note that Turkey ran a similar [deposit scheme] in the 1970s, and it did not result in many positives, actually just accentuated the boom/bust credit cycle,” he added.
