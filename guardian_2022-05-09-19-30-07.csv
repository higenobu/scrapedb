5/9/2022,"This is a girl-meets-girl story of two women flirting at a nightclub, falling in love and vowing never to become like other boring couples whose sex and conversation gets stale. We feel the sparks between them as Juniper (Stella Taylor) and Jules (Gabriella Schmidt) entwine themselves on Cara Evans’ simple set of a single bed on the traverse stage. Jules looks wondrously at Juniper’s vagina – she has only ever had boyfriends before now – and accidentally tells her she loves her. If they ever split up, says Juniper, she would end up looking for someone else exactly like Jules. It is a bright, shiny button of an affair but – of course – they begin to bicker and hit the buffers as the relationship progresses. While their trajectory is a fairly familiar one, there is so much zest and freshness in Stephanie Martin’s funny, sweet and quietly radical script that this couple’s story feels entirely unique, their dialogue staying sharp and original. Beautifully directed by Bethany Pitts, the exuberant tennis match conversations are balanced against beats of silence and lively music by Nicola T Chang. Even the baldly romantic lines zing and have little trace of schmaltz. “All of this space has opened up inside,” says Jules, after sleeping with Juniper for the first time. When they jokingly talk about splitting up, Jules says there is no way she would leave: “We’ve just bought a new mop.” There are greater questions asked around love and freedom: how to be in a relationship that still allows for excitement, individual autonomy and a lack of possessiveness. “What if we run out of things to say?” asks Jules, and floats the idea of “ethical non-monogamy” which brings the play’s biggest tensions. Both performances are scintillating, full of chemistry and nuance with niftily enacted sex scenes. They are by turns meltingly adoring of each other (“I don’t have words for that feeling,” one says to the other about her attraction) but also cruel (“I’m so bored of you”) and sadly vulnerable (“You stopped looking at me. Your face changed”). It is an intense love story, in the sweetest possible sense, and a must-see for all romantics, and otherwise.

5/9/2022,"I keep running into people who feel overwhelmed by so many seemingly unrelated but terrifying things occurring all at once. “How can all this be happening?” they ask. But these things are connected. They are reinforcing each other. As such, they pose a clear challenge to a decent society. Putin invades Ukraine. Trump refuses to concede and promotes his big lie. Rightwing politicians in America and Europe inflame white Christian nationalism. Television pundits spur bigotry toward immigrants. Politicians target LGBTQ+ youth. Powerful men sexually harass and abuse women. Abortion bans harm women unable to obtain safe abortions. Police kill innocent Black people with impunity. CEOs rake in record profits and compensation but give workers meager wages and fire them for unionizing. The richest men in the world own the most influential media platforms. Billionaires make large campaign donations (read: legal bribes) so lawmakers won’t raise their taxes. What connects these? All are abuses of power. All are occurring at a time when power and wealth are concentrated in few hands. It is important to see the overall pattern because each of these sorts of abuses encourages other abuses. Stopping them – standing up against all forms of bullying and brutality – is essential to preserving a civil society. Throughout history, the central struggle of civilization has been against brutality by the powerful. The state of nature is a continuous war in which only the fittest survive – where lives are “nasty, brutish, and short,” in the words of the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes. Without norms, rules, and laws preventing the stronger from attacking or oppressing the weaker, none of us is safe. We all live in fear. Even the most powerful live in fear of being attacked or deposed. Civilization is the opposite of a state of nature. A civil society doesn’t allow the strong to brutalize the weak. The responsibility of all who seek a decent society is to move as far from a state of nature as possible. Certain inequalities of power are expected, even in a civil society. Some people are bigger and stronger than others. Some are quicker of mind and body. Some have more forceful personalities. Some have fewer scruples. Some inequalities of income and wealth may be necessary to encourage hard work and inventiveness, from which everyone benefits. But when inequalities become too wide, they invite abuses. Such abuses invite further abuses until society degenerates into a Hobbesian survival of the most powerful. An entire society – even the world – can descend into chaos. Every time the stronger bully the weaker, the social fabric is tested. If bullying is not contained, the fabric unwinds. Some posit a moral equivalence between those who seek social justice and those who want to protect individual liberty, between “left” and “right.” But there is no moral equivalence between bullies and the bullied, between tyranny and democracy, between brutality and decency – no “balance” between social justice and individual liberty. No individual can be free in a society devoid of justice. There can be no liberty where brutality reigns. The struggle for social justice is the most basic struggle of all because it defines how far a civilization has come from a Hobbesian survival of the most powerful. A civil society stops brutality, holds the powerful accountable, and protects the vulnerable. Putin must be stopped. Trump must be held accountable. Rightwing politicians who encourage white Christian nationalism must be condemned and voted out of office. Celebrity pundits who fuel racism and xenophobia must be denounced and defunded. Powerful men who sexually harass or abuse women must be prosecuted. Women must have safe means of ending pregnancies they don’t want. Police who kill innocent Black people must be brought to justice. CEOs who treat their employees badly must be exposed and penalized. Billionaires who bribe lawmakers to cut their taxes or exempt them from regulations must be sanctioned, as should lawmakers who accept such bribes. This is what civilization demands. This is what the struggle is all about. This is why that struggle is so critical.

5/9/2022,"Good morning. Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers they are “fighting for the same thing their fathers and grandfathers did” as he used his Victory Day speech to tie the war in Ukraine to the memory of the second world war and justify his invasion. Prior to the speech, foreign officials had said Putin could use it to launch a full mobilisation of Russian troops or formally declare war in Ukraine, but there were no large policy announcements. Instead he suggested Russia was “forced” into the war by Nato and pledged to provide aid for the families of soldiers who had died in what the Kremlin is calling a “special operation”. Speaking at the 77th annual celebration of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president launched a defence of his war in Ukraine, pivoting from a recognition of Russia’s “greatest generation” to a description of how it was believed Ukraine was being armed by the west for an imminent attack on Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. What did the G7’s statement marking the anniversary say? Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has brought shame on Russia and the sacrifices its people made to defeat Nazi Germany in the second world war, leaders of the G7 group of leading western economies said. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 75 of the invasion. Members on the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack on 6 January are moving closer to issuing subpoenas to Republican members of Congress to compel their cooperation in the inquiry – though it has started to dawn on them that they may be out of time. The panel is expected to make a final decision on the subpoena question over the next couple of weeks, according to sources directly familiar with internal deliberations, with House investigators needing to start wrapping up their work before public hearings in June. While the members on the committee remain undecided about whether to subpoena Republican members of Congress, their refusal to assist the investigation has caused the sentiment to turn towards taking that near-unprecedented action, the sources said. The shifting view has come as a result of the dismay among the members in January, when the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and others turned down requests for voluntary cooperation, turning to anger after three more of Donald Trump’s allies last week refused to cooperate. What has changed in recent weeks? Sources said the select committee’s assessment can no longer ignore the deep involvement between some Republican members of Congress and the former president’s unlawful schemes to overturn the election. In the years before Canada’s supreme court legalised abortion in 1988, it was common for Canadians who needed abortions to travel to the US. “We had a network of people who could make referrals and help them get there [to the US]. If it’s necessary, that probably would happen again – but the other way,” said Carolyn Egan, spokesperson for the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada. If, as a leaked draft decision indicates, the US supreme court votes to overturn Roe v Wade, many Americans in need of surgical abortion could be forced to travel not just across state lines but, once again, across international borders, writes Hilary Beaumont. On Tuesday, Canada’s minister of families, Karina Gould, reaffirmed that Americans can access abortion services in Canada. “If they, people, come here and need access, certainly, you know, that’s a service that would be provided,” she told CBC News. South of the US border, Mexican advocates are also preparing for an increase in Americans visiting to access abortion services. How are GOP lawmakers prepping to ban abortion as soon as legally possible? Here is what Republican state lawmakers across the country are doing in the lead up to the decision to assure that abortion restrictions will swiftly go into effect. What about the Democrats? Senator Kirsten Gillibrand called the battle over abortion rights in the US the “biggest fight of a generation”. The New York Democrat urged her party to stand up to Republicans seeking to abolish the constitutional right. The US first lady, Jill Biden, made an unannounced visit to western Ukraine on Sunday, holding a surprise Mother’s Day meeting with the nation’s first lady, Olena Zelenskiy. She traveled under the cloak of secrecy, becoming the latest high-profile American to enter Ukraine during the 10-week-old conflict. Polls have opened in the Philippines as the country decides its next president in a polarising race between frontrunner Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son of the late dictator, and a human rights lawyer who has vowed to tackle old, rotten politics. Opinion surveys suggest Marcos Jr, known as Bongbong, is poised to win. The torsos of two statues of boxers, dating back to the iron age, have been discovered at the Mont’e Prama necropolis in Sardinia. The latest finds, sculpted in limestone by the Nuragic civilisation, add to several other statues of boxers, wrestlers and archers dug up at the site since the 1970s. The New York Times has removed the word “fetus” from its Wordle answers to keep the game “distinct from the news”, a move apparently related to last week’s leaked Roe v Wade supreme court draft ruling. The change caused confusion as it was only implemented for some of the game’s players. About 20m acres of cropland in the United States may be contaminated from PFAS-tainted sewage sludge that has been used as fertilizer, a new report estimates. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 9,000 compounds used to make products heat-, water- or stain-resistant. Known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally break down, they have been linked to cancer, thyroid disruption, liver problems, birth defects, immunosuppression and more. From The Nan Movie to Fun with Dick and Jane to American Pie to the Nutty Professor, ads for comedies nearly always follow one distinctive style. The titles are big and they are red. But who started the trend for big red titles on empty backgrounds trend and why is it red that tickles our funny bones? Amelia Tait looked into it and found that the humble bus shelter may have the answer. Dumped at sea, lost on land or left to rot in shops and fridges, the global catch of fish is being wasted like never before – hurting not only the oceans but the nutrition of billions of people. Figures from WWF show that in 2019, at least 230,000 tonnes of fish were dumped in EU waters. But this figure is a fraction of an even larger global issue. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates 35% of all fish, crustaceans and molluscs harvested from oceans, lakes and fish farms are wasted or lost before they ever reach a plate. Running a small restaurant in Ontario in the 1970s, Irene and Tony Demas soon learned the value of trading their dishes for the talents of local bakers, craftspeople and artisans. For an English painter with a predictable palate, the couple struck a deal: they would get paintings from him and his friends in exchange for grilled cheese sandwiches. By chance, that deal unwittingly netted them a painting by the acclaimed Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis – a work that nearly five decades later is expected to net more than C$35,000 (US$27,000) when it goes to auction this month.

5/9/2022,"Former Opals captain Jenna O’Hea has spoken about the incident which prompted Liz Cambage’s messy exit from the national program, alleging unconfirmed claims the star told her Nigerian rivals to “go back to your third-world country” are true. Cambage was independently investigated and issued a formal reprimand – but not suspended or fined – after last year’s practice-game altercation derailed the Opals’ Tokyo Olympics campaign. In the days after the Nigeria clash she withdrew from the Games citing mental health concerns and then, despite remaining available for selection for this year’s World Cup in Sydney, said she would never again play for the Opals. However, the specifics of Cambage’s on-court actions have remained a mystery since. On Sunday, while O’Hea was a guest on the ABC’s Offsiders program, she was asked about the incident by the show’s host, Kelli Underwood. “This all started in that training game, or the pre-Olympics game, when you played Nigeria,” Underwood said. “And it’s never really emerged what happened, but I’ve had it confirmed from a few sources, is it correct that you were playing Nigeria and Liz Cambidge had her feathers ruffled and she turned to them and said, ‘go back to your third world country’? “And, of course, Ezi Magbegor is originally Nigerian, a Nigerian who is now living in Australia and playing for your team, and as a result there was a brawl that erupted, and since then you haven’t spoken to her?” O’Hea responded with the claim: “That is all 100% correct.” Fellow guest Caroline Wilson then asked O’Hea whether Cambage would ever represent Australia again. “No,” O’Hea said. Last July, when Cambage unexpectedly withdrew from the Australian team on the eve of the Olympics, she called it “literally one of the hardest decisions of my life”. In a social media post, she also hit out at “lies” and “fake news” surrounding her decision and directly responded to speculation about the on-court incident during that scrimmage against Nigeria. “Yeah, things got heated in the Nigeria game, there was a physical altercation and there were words exchanged,” Cambage said. “But I’m hearing things that aren’t true at all. Everything that happened and everything I’ve said is on film.” Offsiders also aired footage of an ABC interview with Cambage from her base in Los Angeles, where she has started playing with WNBA side the LA Sparks. The 30-year-old, who has a Nigerian father, said: “I’m living my best life. I’m supported. I’m protected on a level that the Opals or the Australian team never gave to me. “My heart lies with those who want to protect me and those who want me to be the best I can be, and I never felt that at the Opals at all.” O’Hea, a long-time captain of Cambage, responded: “I can hold my head up high and say I always loved her, always cared for her, supported her, had her back. That is her reality and the listeners and watchers out there can believe who they want to believe. “Everyone’s done more than enough. We’ve sacrificed a lot to try and keep her in the program. She doesn’t want to be here anymore. That’s her choice and we need to move on without her.” O’Hea did say the Sparks appeared a good fit for Cambage. “She’s always wanted to be in LA,” she said. “I think she’s happy that she’s there, and when she’s happy she plays really good basketball.” The Opals struggled without Cambage in Tokyo but O’Hea said with proper preparation Sandy Brondello’s outfit would play to its ranking – which has long fluctuated between No 2 and No 3 in the world – at Sydney’s World Cup. Their September campaign could also mark the return of Lauren Jackson, who has dominated at NBL1 level for Albury-Wodonga since coming out of retirement. “There’s so many wonderfully talented basketballers in Australia, so many playing in the WNBA,” O’Hea said. “With the right preparation we can do really well. “There’s so many great role models ... I want the media to focus on those who want to play for the Opals and represent Australia.”",Sport/Sport,Former Opals captain alleges that claims Liz Cambage told Nigerian basketball players ‘go back to your third-world country’ are true,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/08/former-opals-captain-alleges-liz-cambage-made-racist-comment-to-nigerian-basketball-players
5/9/2022,"Acry of joy rang out as the two young women – one reeling from a 34-hour trek out of Ukraine and the other just off a late-night work shift – spotted each other on a pavement in Catalonia. The reunion had been decades in the making, the final details hastily hashed out as Russian tanks rolled on to the streets of Ukraine. “The moment was both happy and sad,” said Angelika Batiai, 24. “Here I was seeing my sister again after 20 years, but on the other hand I had just left my family and friends in a country at war.” The half-sisters had spent the first years of their lives together in the southern Ukrainian village of Nikolaev, leaning on each other as they grew up with only an absentee mother to care for them. Family problems left them separated soon after; five-year-old Angelika was sent to live with an aunt and Tatyana, six, with a grandmother before ending up in state care. They begged to be kept together, recalled Tatyana Kluge García, 25. “But economically it was impossible, Angelika’s aunt couldn’t afford to take us both in.” At the age of eight, Tatyana was adopted by a family in the Spanish city of Girona, near Barcelona, trading her arduous beginning for a new family, country and slate of languages. Even as her command of Ukrainian faded, her sister remained constantly in her thoughts. “I always said that I would go to Ukraine and find her,” said Tatyana. As a teenager she scoured social media for any trace of her sister, even downloading the Russian social network VK at one point. More than 2,000 miles away in Ukraine, Angelika was doing the same. When she stumbled across a Facebook profile in 2019 that showed a beaming young woman in Spain, she was certain she had found Tatyana. “I just knew it was my sister.” Within weeks the two were chatting constantly online, pushing past language and cultural barriers. “It was like a girlfriend that you’re getting to know but really it’s your sister and you want to share your life with her,” said Tatyana. Excitedly they made plans to meet up in Spain, only to have the possibility derailed by the pandemic. In February, as Russian troops amassed on the border of Ukraine, Tatyana made a frantic call to Angelika. “I told her that here they’re saying that there’s going to be a war,” she said. Angelika sought to temper her sister’s fears. “I was hoping all of this would blow over and everything would be fine,” she said. “But it just got worse and worse.” She and her fiance left their home in Nova Odesa, heading to a nearby village where her cousin had converted his basement into a makeshift shelter. As the sound of bombings cracked in the distance, they would dart into the basement. “Tatyana was texting me every day, saying pack up, we’re all waiting for you, we’re worried,” she said. Angelika canvassed those around her, but her loved ones were determined to stay. “It was a very difficult decision because I didn’t want to leave my family,” she said. “I was also very worried about how I was going to get there on my own – it was a long way.” In the end it was a message from Tatyana’s mother, reinforcing that she would be safe in Spain, that convinced Angelika. She set off for the Polish border in a vehicle with other Ukrainians looking to leave, steeling herself for the worst. “I was terrified we would be detained or that there would be an air alert,” said Angelika. Her anxiety was laced with nervousness for what lay ahead: “The whole way I was thinking about what it would be like to see my sister and whether she would accept me,” she said. From her home in Girona, Tatyana tracked Angelika’s every step. She bought her a plane ticket from Warsaw, battling spotty mobile coverage and language barriers to make sure her sister made it on to the flight. “I was going crazy,” said Tatyana. “She had never been on a plane, she didn’t know how to check in or check her baggage.” The days of anxiety melted away as soon as she spotted her sister. “I had always wondered what that moment would be like,” said Tatyana. “You think: ‘Maybe I’ll be in shock, maybe I won’t know what to say, maybe I’ll cry.’ But in the end I just couldn’t believe it was happening.” In the month since Angelika’s arrival in Spain, the sisters have carved out a comfortable coexistence in Tatyana’s apartment, using hand gestures, a handful of shared vocabulary and a lot of Google Translate to communicate. The ease of their interactions belies their decades apart; Angelika, who hates carrying a handbag, stuffs her phone and charger into her older sister’s purse whenever they leave the house, while the two trade quiet nods of affirmation as they delve into the details of their past. “There are days that go by and I’m looking at her and I still can’t believe it,” said Tatyana. “I just think: ‘You’re here.’” Echoing the uncertainty facing many of the 135,000 Ukrainian refugees who have arrived in Spain in recent months, neither sister knows what comes next: whether Angelika will eventually return to her fiance, job and family in Ukraine, or seek to bring them to Spain and start over. “Since we were little we’ve been dreaming of seeing each other again, but we would never have imagined that it would be because of a war,” said Tatyana. For Angelika, being back with her sister was a “wonderful, unbelievable feeling”. The joy, however, was rivalled by the angst of leaving her loved ones in a country at war. “I just can’t stop thinking about it.”",News/World news,‘It was happy and sad’: sisters reunited after 20 years by war in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/it-was-happy-and-sad-sisters-reunited-after-20-years-by-war-in-ukraine
5/9/2022,"You’ve not known humiliation until you’ve had John Malkovich pant “Walk of shame!” at you as you skulk back to your motel room. That is one bizarre moment in this halting and derivative thriller, which exists somewhere on the continuum between erotic and psychological. Malkovich puts in a batty turn as a motel owner that would have had “paycheque” written all over it except for his co-producer credit. The shamee in question is Sky (Lilly Krug), a permanent resident at the motel who, thanks to a chance encounter in a supermarket wine aisle, has just bagged the attentions of local tech millionaire Chris (Cameron Monaghan). Living alone in a wood-panelled designer home and estranged from his wife and kid, this emotionally constipated app developer is obsessed with his security system. But Sky, living in fear of an abusive roommate, activates his protective side. As well as volcanic nookie, they bond over their deprived childhoods. Alas, she is not who she says she is. Subtlety is not director Luis Prieto’s strong suit – and he struggles to build tension or much emotional connection to the pair. But once Chris is wheelchair- and penthouse-bound, Prieto uses a certain reptilian dependence on sex and violence to drum up a fairly satisfying blend of Basic Instinct and Misery. If Shattered doesn’t quite mobilise its high-spec interiors with the same inventiveness as Panic Room, it half-compensates by maximising the impact of its vicious streak. The bright-eyed and brutal Krug makes a decent fist of her first lead role – her allure reinforced when Prieto lifts Grace Kelly’s Rear Window “waking” introduction for her. She exploits her physicality with uninhibited glee both in the bedroom and during more overt coercion. It’s a shame that, instead of fully milking Sky’s sociopathic reserves, the film instead cedes to Frank Grillo; a man who these days appears in so many B-movies that you suspect he must come with a tax rebate. Shattered ably ticks genre boxes, but fails to drill into the characters in a way that counts.

5/9/2022,"In January 2014, Anil was left devastated when his eldest son, Wesley, died in a motorbike accident. “I went into shock; it was all a blur,” he says. “People were kind and tried to help, but I was in a massive pit of grief that I couldn’t get out of.” That summer, he joined a group for bereaved parents. “It was really helpful. It felt like the only place you could be yourself and didn’t have to put on a brave face.” At the group, he met Clare, who had also lost her son, Matthew, in a motorbike accident. “The group became a lifeline for me,” she says. “At the first meeting I went to, the group leaders told me about Anil, because he had lost his son in such similar circumstances. We met at the next meeting.” Although Anil felt they had an immediate connection, he was wary of coming on too strong. “I liked her straight away, but it’s hard to know where your emotions are in that situation, so I questioned my feelings,” he says. Clare felt the same way. “He seemed like a very sincere and genuine person, but it felt strange to like someone so soon after losing Matthew.” Before Christmas, Anil asked Clare if she would like to meet for coffee. “It ended up being a nine-hour date with dinner,” he says. “I offered to go to the inquest into Matthew’s death with Clare in the new year, because I’d been through it myself and knew how traumatic it was.” In the end, she went with her ex-partner, but Anil brought her flowers afterwards. In the new year, they began to meet more regularly and by February they were a couple. They started spending so much time together that Clare’s children eventually guessed what was going on. “They were really pleased for me,” she says. Anil’s younger son has also met Clare and is happy for his father. Although they relied on each other for emotional support, they also laughed together. “It sounds strange, but it wasn’t all doom and gloom – we needed to laugh too,” says Anil. They spend their time between Anil’s flat in south Gloucestershire and Clare’s house in Surrey, with their rescue dog, Widget. “We love going on long walks together,” she says. Since losing their sons, the couple have faced more challenges together. “My children have had some health problems, but Anil has been a huge support,” says Clare. “My mum has dementia, too, and he helps me out so much. He’s always so calm and kind.” In 2016, Anil had a heart attack and was nursed by Clare. “I moved into her place at the time,” he says. “It was so nice not to feel isolated while I recovered.” They continue to support each other in celebrating the lives of the sons they lost. “I do an annual 18-mile walk following the routes I used to go on with Wesley,” says Anil. Clare’s son also loved the outdoors. “He adored animals, too, so getting the dog has been great. When I’m walking with Widget, I’m reminded of Matthew.” The couple plan to travel to Anil’s native Sri Lanka and they love cooking meals together. “Anil really appreciates the simple joys in life,” says Clare. “He’s always patient and we love laughing together. He understands that it’s important to find a sense of happiness again after tragedy.” Anil believes their positivity keeps them going. “Life has thrown a lot at Clare, but she’s very resilient,” he says. “I think it helps to keep the memory of your loved ones alive.” Want to share your story?

5/9/2022,"Ayoung shrimp is perplexed as to why all his family walk backwards. He wants to walk forwards, so decides to teach himself. The first day is a disaster: he trips over his tail and crushes one leg with another. Undefeated, he practises. “My son!” weeps his mother. “Get a grip,” his dad says, “and walk like your family, who love you so much.” Now, the shrimp loves his family, too, but knows he must walk on. After a while, he meets three frogs. One tells him the world is going wrong, another that what he is doing is dangerous, while the third simply says: “Oh dear, oh dear.” But the shrimp continues until he hears a voice: “I was like you,” an old shrimp tells him. “Thought I could teach shrimps to walk forwards, but they turned their backs on me. Go back, or end up alone like me.” The young shrimp stays silent; he knows he is doing the right thing, and walks forwards. I first heard the story of the young shrimp at a children’s theatre in Rome. It is from a collection called Favole al Telefono (Telephone Tales), by Gianni Rodari. Later, it became a bedtime story, read so often it got under our skin. And now it bobs up at the very mention of prawns, and especially when I pull off 10 legs and feel like the trouble in the tale. But I put them to good use, along with the shells and heads, and make a broth for risotto. There is a telephone tale for chopping, too: Cipollino, a little onion boy who leads an uprising of garden vegetables – courgette, radish, leek – against their tyrannical landowner, Prince Lemon. Born in 1920 near Lake Orta in Piedmont, Rodari was the son of a baker who became a teacher and saw how students responded to stories. When war began, he joined the resistance and enrolled in the Italian communist party, writing articles, including some for children, for the party newspaper, l’Unità. In Rome, he continued to write articles, publish stories and books (30 in total), which are cherished by generations. Like teaching, politics accompanied Rodari’s life, and his beliefs are threaded through his work. Solidarity, friendship, doing the right thing, not losing your feet and standing up to bullies are recurring themes in his surreal, vivid, optimistic stories. The Telephone Tales begin with the introduction of Signor Bianchi, a travelling salesman who, like Rodari, has a daughter he calls every night with a story. Rabbits who hunt, a man made of butter, buildings of ice-cream, a nose that runs away – stories so good that even the ladies at the telephone exchange would stop working and listen in. And Rodari’s young prawn? Having escaped the risotto trouble, did he go far, or make a fortune? We don’t know, only that he is still walking forwards with courage. Buon viaggio!

Put the prawn peelings, bay leaves and peppercorns in a pan, cover with the water and add a pinch of salt. Bring up to a gentle boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes. Strain into a clean pan and keep the stock warm at the back of the stove. (If you are using peeled prawns, put the fish stock in a pan and warm likewise.) In a large saute pan, gently fry the diced vegetables in the butter and olive oil with a pinch of salt over a medium-low flame, until soft and turning translucent. Add the rice and stir so every grain glistens and clatters against the sides of the pan. Add the wine and allow to wooosh and evaporate, then look at the clock. Add the prawn or fish stock a ladle at a time, stirring attentively until all the liquid is absorbed before adding the next ladleful. Continue adding the stock ladle by ladle, adding the prawns in the last few minutes of cooking: work on the principle that the total cooking time will be 17-20 minutes, depending on the rice. The risotto is ready when the rice is plump and firm, but without any chalky bite, and the consistency is soft, fluid and creamy – keep tasting. Take the pan off the heat, beat in the lemon zest and any spare fennel fronds, then serve.

5/9/2022,"Anthony Albanese has called on Scott Morrison to respond to the “serious issue” of a Liberal National candidate being referred to federal police for allegedly giving a false address on his nomination form. As prepolling opened on Monday the opposition targeted the LNP candidate for the Labor-held marginal seat of Lilley in northern Brisbane, Vivian Lobo, with posters informing voters of the federal police referral. Labor’s Anika Wells, who holds the seat of Lilley, received an apology from the LNP over a separate incident at a prepoll centre on Monday after one of its members abused the sitting MP. Lobo told the Australian Electoral Commission he was living in a home in Everton Park within the electorate, but the property appears to be uninhabited, unfurnished and in a state of disrepair. Lobo is reportedly living in the neighbouring electorate of Brisbane. The LNP candidate has promised to “fully cooperate” with federal police, claiming he signed a lease but didn’t get time to move in before the campaign. Wells said in a tweet: “The LNP’s actions in Lilley have been really disrespectful to my community, who are owed an explanation.” Labor senator Murray Watt tweeted: “Prepoll has just started and the LNP are still promoting their Lilley candidate who is under [federal] police investigation. Will Scott Morrison intervene and direct this to stop?” Labor senator Anthony Chisholm tweeted a photo of prepoll signage displayed by Labor as a “public service” informing voters of the referral: The LNP are refusing to suspend their campaign in Lilley despite their candidate being under police investigation. Consider this message at pre-poll a community service. pic.twitter.com/IzYh2aHrLe At a press conference in Adelaide, Albanese said the prime minister “needs to do more to respond to the referral of the candidate for Lilley to the Australian Federal Police by the Australian Electoral Commission”. “This is a really serious issue and the prime minister needs to respond as to what action he will take on this issue.” In a statement, Lobo said he had intended to live at the address on his nomination form but was delayed in moving. “I enrolled in the electorate as I had signed a lease in Everton Park with the intention to move in straight away,” he said. “However due to my campaign commitments and difficulty with getting tradespeople to the home, I was delayed moving in.” On Monday, Wells was targeted at prepoll by an LNP member who she said had called her a “fucking dog”. Wells reported the incident to the returning officer who in turn told the Australian Federal Police. No formal complaint was made. “I called him out to his face – and he was gone by the time I came back,” Wells said. “It’s unacceptable.” An LNP spokesperson confirmed it had apologised to Wells “after a member who attended prepoll this morning was rude and disrespectful to her”. The party denies that the member was handing out or volunteering for it. “The member in question will be subject to a disciplinary process. The behaviour of this individual does not reflect the values or standards of the LNP,” the spokesperson said. The Liberal candidate in the safe Labor seat of McMahon in New South Wales, Vivek Singha, also called the police over an alleged prepoll incident on Monday. Singha accused a Labor prepoll worker of having threatened to “fix [him] up” – an offer to fight him. “I will take this to its logical legal conclusion,” Singha said. “It’s not acceptable.” “We want a civil discussion with voters – we can’t have these clowns disrupting prepoll.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning An AFP spokesperson said it does not comment on matters that may be the subject of investigation.

5/9/2022,"The EU has warned the UK to “dial down the rhetoric” and start being “honest” to voters about the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol after the historic Stormont election that put Sinn Féin top of the polls. As the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) warned it could stall the return of power-sharing until Christmas, the EU vice-president Maroš Šefčovič said it was also keen to find solutions. “We need the UK government to dial down the rhetoric, be honest about the deal they signed and agree to find solutions within its framework,” he said in a statement. “The EU has already shown a lot of flexibility by proposing impactful, durable solutions and we stand ready to continue discussions.” The Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, claimed the flexibility shown by the EU “has not been reciprocated”, suggesting its recent threats over unilateral action to disapply some of the checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea had “made the EU more cautious”. He said he would like to think the British government would continue to approach the issue with a determination to get the matter “resolved sensibly”, adding that the Irish government would help to facilitate this. “The politics of this is more problematic than resolving the actual trading issues around the protocol.” Brussels sources pointed out that talks between Šefčovič and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, paused in the run-up to the Stormon election, but said they would relaunch with a renewed intensity. They indicated there was room for a deal but the UK needed to show the will to get something over the line. The talks are likely to continue for some months. Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg have recently hinted at unilateral action to “fix” the protocol but have pulled back from threats of new domestic laws to disapply some of the protocol. Diplomatic sources at the EU say that any such unilateral action will be met with retaliatory measures, adding that even in the context of the war in Ukriane they would not be able to “ignore” such a move. The UK government will take “whatever measures are necessary” to amend the Brexit protocol, the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, has pledged. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, has ruled out any imminent prospect of a referendum on a united Ireland. After a resounding election victory for Sinn Féin, the DUP has said it cannot fill the position of deputy first minister until Brexit checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain are removed. Raab told Sky News on Sunday: “If anything, the outcome in Northern Ireland from those elections makes it clear it [a protocol change] can’t be put off.”",News/World news,"Start being honest with voters about Northern Ireland protocol, EU tells UK ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/start-being-honest-northern-ireland-protocol-brexit-eu-tells-uk
5/9/2022,"Vladimir Putin was born seven years after the end of the second world war, and raised on the Brezhnev-era myth of the great victory. A man of no great education, he loved to quote Soviet films and old stories. The history books portrayed the “great patriotic war” as a magical fable in which the hero – the Russian people – vanquishes a monster, to the envy of the whole world. In this myth there was no room for many of the actual facts of war, such as the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact, the war with Finland, the occupation of the Baltics. The myth ignores the deportation of millions of Poles. It glosses over the Rzhev campaign of the winter of 1942-43, in which the Soviet army sustained terrible losses, preferring to dwell on the storied victories of Moscow and Stalingrad. The myth, celebrated today on Russia’s Victory Day, has become the essential narrative underpinning Putin’s plan to rule Russia eternally. There came a point when Putin resolved to stay in power indefinitely. Elections would come and go, and he would lie that they would be his last, that he had no intention of changing Russia’s 1993-era constitution, which provides for a maximum of two consecutive terms. His first strategy for eternal rule was to allow citizens to become wealthy, as the country became richer than it had ever been in the second half of the 2000s. But when growth stopped, with much of the wealth captured in a few hands, he had to turn to propaganda. He began to invoke a sense of “traditional values” to augment the notion of his paramount importance to Russia – the indispensable leader who was the only defence for Russians against westernisation and dissolution in the sea of European peoples. And Putin came to believe his own propaganda – that he now had a special historic mission to create a Greater Russia. Not quite a new USSR, because no one was about to rebuild Communism, or invent some new ideology or recolonise Central Asia so as to secure nice cheap labour for the Russian economy. Greater Russia fancied itself as the world’s third big power (along with the US and China). And if the rival US had the EU as its satellite then Greater Russia would need its own sphere of influence. Putin’s “traditional values” essentially boiled down to homophobia and the cult of military victory. It quickly became clear that persecuting gay people didn’t really amount to a durable strategy for the eternal rule of a strong leader. The cult of victory was all that was left. The picture slowly took shape. The operetta of Russian militarism grew out of TV propaganda, where numerous “experts” began to speak of how we were the strongest in the world, no one could order us around, our rockets could circle the world several times and destroy anyone we wanted. It was ridiculous, but Putin’s speeches slowly began to sound more and more like those of the late neofascist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. He spoke less and less about dull things like economic development, but really lit up when talking about new “unparalleled” types of weapons. “We can do it again,” became the main slogan of Putin’s Russia, a clear reference to the fact that Russians defeated Nazism in the second world war, and believe they can do it again.Putin has won four presidential elections, but a fifth is looming in 2024. Covid took a heavy toll in Russia and the economy has slumped, so Putin’s options are few. In his mind, his best way to hold on to power is a repeat of the great victory. A symbolic march-past on 9 May would not be enough; they’d need to fill the image with blood. And so they tried to “do it again”, orchestrating Europe’s biggest tragedy since 1945. The war is the world’s first to have been directly invented by TV. It also feels like the moment when the Soviet Union truly fell apart, because Russia, as heir to that empire, cannot come through this crisis with all those Soviet myths about victory still intact. We shouldn’t be surprised that most Russians have bought into this and are indifferent to the military crimes being committed in Ukraine. It’s not just that they don’t get the full picture because of the obliteration of journalism and social media. It’s that if you stop believing the propaganda, then you no longer can believe in a Russia of traditional values, a victory-day hero nation. All that is left is a wild person wandering through the ruins of a militarised kleptocracy, carrying a nuclear suitcase in his hand. And who wants to believe in that? Who are we, and how did we let this happen? It’s scary to answer this question. Russians will hold on to their myths until the very last. In the meantime, they have their military parade, their victory day swoon, the opiate of the masses. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

5/9/2022,"Amonth after Putin’s “special operation” in Ukraine began, the Levada Centre, a non-governmental polling organisation, carried out a survey to gauge public attitudes towards the conflict. The results were awaited with some trepidation. Some thought they would show public dissatisfaction with the leadership and that the president’s ratings would fall. Others demurred. There were precedents. After Russia’s short war with Georgia in 2008, Vladimir Putin’s approval rating shot up to 88%. In 2014, after the annexation of Crimea, the same thing happened: the proportion of people who said they approved of his leadership once again rose to the same figure. In both instances, negative global reaction merely served to strengthen the Russian belief that they were right. Sanctions did little damage. This time, it’s different. Military action is proving to be neither quick nor bloodless. Everyone understands that, even those who only listen to the voices coming out of their TVs. This time, there is a broad, anxious expectation of lean times, of economic blockade. There is a school of thought that hails from Soviet times that the refrigerator is more powerful than the TV. Could that be right this time? So far, the signs are mixed. Just as in 2014, there has been a rise in the approval rating of the operation and its commander in chief. Once again, Putin is polling at above 80%, 12 points higher than in February. The government and prime minister are also polling well. Even the state Duma, which normally languishes in negative territory, is basking in positive ratings. But it’s not all positive news for Russia’s political class: an absolute majority, 55%, expects an improvement in political life over the coming months. They cannot be disappointed. This will have to be created – if not in real life then in the virtual world. And for those who look at the 80%-plus ratings and declare that the TV has finally triumphed over the refrigerator, we must say no. Everything is a little more nuanced. In the survey, we asked Russians the question: what kind of emotions does the military operation in Ukraine evoke in you? Just 2% could not answer, while 8% said they had no particular feeling at all about it. The other respondents chose from a multitude of words to describe their feelings. These words broadly fell into four categories – either positive or negative, and either political or apolitical. So the positive political emotion could be described as national pride; the negative political emotions were more like anger and shame; the positive apolitical words covered emotions such as joy and excitement; the negative apolitical emotions were fear, anxiety, horror and shock. If we look broadly at the percentage of positive versus negative emotions, it is neck and neck – 51% versus 49%. But within these numbers lie interesting breakdowns: the positive emotions mostly comprise people expressing national pride (40%). Only a few (11%) expressed positive apolitical emotions like joy and satisfaction. Among negative feelings, the split was roughly reversed. Just 10% felt negative political emotions like anger, disgust and shame about the Ukraine assault. A full 39% reported emotions of worry, fear, shock. From these numbers, you have to conclude that the support the Russian public has for the army and its leadership coexists alongside a great anxiety. When you look at generational breakdowns, moreover, it’s clear that these events are being perceived differently by young and old people. Negative feelings predominate in those under 35. Only 33% feel national pride, while 37% feel anxious and fearful. Those over 65, on the other hand, are far more positive, with a 90% approval rating for Putin and few expressions of fear or anxiety. Young and old also differed dramatically in their assessment of what motivated the anti-war protests that we saw in the weeks after 24 February. Older people tended to favour the explanation that people were paid to protest. Younger people were more likely to put the protests down to genuine outrage over events.
