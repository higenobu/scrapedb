3/1/2022,"Ukrainian United Nations Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya read text messages between a fallen Russian soldier and the soldier's mother in front of the U.N. General Assembly on Monday. Kyslytsya did not identify the soldier or explain how he obtained the screenshot, though he did say the messages were sent only ""several moments"" before the soldier was killed. Before reading the messages, Kyslytsya held up a printout of what he described as ""an actual screenshot from someone who is dead already."" Kyslytsya delivered his speech to the General Assembly in English but read the messages in the original Russian. A transcript of the simultaneous translation is provided below: MOTHER: Why has it been so long since you responded? Are you really in training exercises? SON: Mama, I'm no longer in Crimea. I'm not in training sessions. MOTHER: Where are you then? Papa is asking whether I can send you a parcel. SON: What kind of a parcel, Mama, can you send me? MOTHER: What are you talking about? What happened? SON: Mama, I'm in Ukraine. There is a real war raging here. I'm afraid. We are bombing all of the cities together, even targeting civilians. We were told that they would welcome us, and they are falling under our armored vehicles, throwing themselves under the wheels and not allowing us to pass. They call us fascists. Mama, this is so hard. After reading the messages, Kyslytsya asked the assembly to ""visualize the magnitude of the tragedy"" caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He also denounced Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to order Russia's nuclear forces to high alert as ""madness"" and implied that any use of nuclear weapons by Putin would be suicidal. ""If [Putin] wants to kill himself, he doesn't need to use nuclear arsenal. He has to do what the guy in Berlin did in a bunker in May 1945,"" Kyslytsya said, drawing a comparison between Putin and Adolf Hitler. “If [Putin] wants to kill himself, he doesn’t need to use nuclear arsenal.

3/1/2022,"An American living in England shared the biggest surprises she encountered after moving across the Atlantic. The fascinating cultural comparison comes courtesy of TikToker user @miriamgiraffe, who moved to London in late 2021. Since then, she went viral for explaining the things that “threw” her most about her new environment. For months now, TikTokers with similar situations have engaged in an ongoing trend, sharing the biggest “culture shocks” they experienced after moving abroad. In a particularly popular clip, a New Zealander working in the U.S. explained her biggest qualms with American taxes. In another, a British TikToker showed how ordering in restaurants is different in the states. Conversely, @miriamgiraffe gave an American’s perspective on British culture. Her first surprise? How English people greet one another. As the TikToker explains, it’s common in the U.K. to ask someone, “Are you alright?” when greeting them. While @miriamgiraffe found the phrase a bit invasive at first, it’s really just a normal way of saying hello — similar to how Americans ask, “How are you?” while not really expecting an honest answer. “It took me a while to figure out what people meant,” @miriamgiraffe added in a comment. “I always thought I must look unwell.” Tinashe is calling the shots: Secondly, @miriamgiraffe was surprised by how Londoners often have to “hail” the bus, even when standing at a designated stop. It’s common to see commuters flag down the city’s buses, despite the fact that, according to Transport for London, drivers must stop at each pickup area regardless. Last but not least, @miriamgiraffe was happily surprised to find that most museums in London offer free entry. While the Smithsonian museums and a handful of others are free in the U.S., this isn’t necessarily a common American practice. For example, New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art — America’s biggest museum by exhibition space — charges $25 for adult entry, excluding residents of the tri-state area. Americans and Brits alike flooded @miriamgiraffe’s comments sections, sharing their thoughts on the differences. “This is so cute, lol,” one user wrote. “The small things we don’t even think [about] are a total mystery to you.” “My brain still shuts down when I hear the phrase, ‘You alright?’ another added.

3/1/2022,"Steven Seagal is speaking out amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""Most of us have friends and family in Russia & Ukraine,"" the action star told Fox News Digital on Monday. ""I look at both as one family and really believe it is an outside entity spending huge sums of money on propaganda to provoke the two countries to be at odds with each other."" ""My prayers are that both countries will come to a positive, peaceful resolution where we can live & thrive together in peace,"" the 69-year-old shared. KIRSTIE ALLEY VOWS 'TO PRAY' FOR UKRAINE AFTER BACKLASH FROM MAKS CHMERKOVSKIY, FANS OVER DELETED TWEET In 2018, the Foreign Ministry announced that Russia appointed Seagal as a special envoy for humanitarian ties with the United States. Seagal’s portfolio in the unpaid position would be to ""facilitate relations between Russia and the United States in the humanitarian field, including cooperation in culture, arts, public and youth exchanges."" Seagal is an accomplished martial artist — like Russian President Vladimir Putin. The actor, who was granted Russian citizenship in 2016, has vocally defended the Russian leader’s policies, including Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, and has criticized the U.S. government. That previous year, Ukraine banned Seagal from entering the country for five years, citing national security reasons. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER In 2016, Putin gave Seagal a Russian passport, calling it a sign of a thaw in relations with the United States. By then, it was noted that Seagal had been a regular visitor to Russia and had accompanied Putin to several martial arts events. After awarding Seagal citizenship through a presidential decree, Putin, 69, hosted the actor and handed him the passport. Putin told Seagal he hopes the ceremony, which was shown on Russian state television, is ""also a sign of a gradual normalization of the relations between the countries."" Ukrainian troops slowed Russia’s advance on key cities, at least for now, while a Ukrainian delegation arrived at the border with Belarus on Monday for talks with Russian officials. European Union defense ministers were also to meet, to discuss how to get weaponry they have pledged into Ukraine. Meanwhile, Western sanctions triggered by the invasion sent the ruble plummeting, leading Russians to line up at banks and ATMs. The Russian military assault on Ukraine went into its fifth day after Putin ordered his nuclear forces put on increased alert, ratcheting up tensions yet further. Kyiv’s outgunned but determined troops slowed Russia’s advance and held onto the capital and other key cities — at least for the time being. Explosions and gunfire that have disrupted life since the invasion began last week appeared to subside around Kyiv overnight. Long lines formed outside supermarkets Monday as residents were allowed out of bomb shelters and homes for the first time since a curfew imposed Saturday. Exact death tolls are unclear, but Ukraine’s president says at least 16 children have been killed and another 45 wounded, among hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other casualties. Millions have fled homes or the country.",World/Fox News,Steven Seagal speaks out amid Russian invasion of Ukraine: ‘I look at both as one family’,https://news.yahoo.com/steven-seagal-speaks-amid-russian-170058541.html
3/1/2022,"It didn't take long for Karin Smith to realize the RV life was not for her. The Jupiter, Florida, resident and single mom bought a 1995 Fleetwood Bounder in January 2021, not only as a tool for travel but for peace of mind. With rent prices in Florida skyrocketing, Smith wanted to make sure she and her son would always have a roof over their heads. ""I've always had fear about homelessness, which is kind of nutty. But it's always in the back of your mind – we're just one paycheck away,"" Smith told USA TODAY. ""So I was thinking an RV would just solve that for me. My son and I could go see America, we wouldn't be tethered to a house. We would always have a place to live."" But owning an RV was more complicated than Smith thought. Her first obstacle: finding a place to keep it. She learned soon after making the purchase that her neighborhood wouldn't allow her to keep the 38-foot vehicle in her driveway, so she started paying $125 a month to store it. Then, she discovered its air conditioner didn't work properly – a necessity in the Florida heat and an expensive repair. Smith was also shocked to discover how much RV parks cost and how little space they offered. ""It just started to feel like a money pit,"" she said. ""I really started thinking about things like: Is this safe? What would I do with Wi-Fi? I work remotely, do I work listening to neighbors (at an RV park) argue or 14 people having a party next door for two days? It all just fell apart."" Smith ended up selling the RV six months after she bought it. She never got behind the wheel. Smith is just one of many Americans who became RV owners during the pandemic. Many are happy with their purchase and the sales show no sign of slowing, but there are some owners who note that rising travel costs and growing crowds have made RV travel more difficult. RVS, CAMPERS, TRAILERS FOR ROAD TRIPS: From cheap to glamp-worthy Bruce Ter Veen, sales director at General RV Center in Wixom, Michigan, said sales have been strong the past two years, with the pandemic driving more people toward RVs. ""First-time buyers coming in the last two years has been a very, very high rate of sales for us,"" he said. ""People (being) able to work and commute differently now is allowing more people to have time in an RV, whether that's partial or full-time living."" Manufacturers have had to increase production to keep up with demand. RV wholesale shipments – the number of new vehicles shipped off to dealers – surpassed 600,000 in 2021, a 19% increase from the previous record in 2017, according to the RV Industry Association. ""The RV industry has been experiencing over 40 years of long-term growth,"" said RV Industry Association spokesperson Monika Geraci. ""The pandemic absolutely supercharged that interest. … There's been this rediscovering of the great outdoors, and that absolutely plays into people prioritizing spending time outdoors and that goes hand in hand with RVing."" Sales aren't expected to slow in 2022. Both Geraci and Ter Veen pointed to attendance rates at RV shows as a barometer for the industry: The 2022 Florida RV SuperShow in Tampa, one of the largest in the country, drew more than 80,000 people last month, a new record. PLANNING RV TRAVEL FOR THE FIRST TIME: 8 tips for newbies I wish I'd known during my first trip But the uptick in RV owners has led to more headaches for some. John Fisher, who travels across the country in his RV six months out of the year for various American Kennel Club events, said living on the road is ""a lot tougher"" than it used to be. Rising prices play a large role. It's not just gas – which is definitely taking a hit on his wallet with the national average for diesel at nearly $4 a gallon – but basics like campground spots and RVs themselves. Fisher upgraded his RV in July and said it was ""incredibly hard"" to find a model that fit his needs in his price range. ""It's getting so expensive to buy an RV. ... When I started looking, they were about $90,000 new and I picked up a used one for $60,000,"" he said of his Grand Design Momentum. ""The manufacturer in the last year, they've gone from $90,000 (for a new model) to about $130,000."" A 2021 report from data analytics company J.D. Power found standard hitch travel trailer values averaged 33% higher in calendar-year 2021 compared to 2020. The report notes that new and used supply ""still lags demand,"" and says buyers should expect strong pricing to continue in the first quarter of 2022. Wait times at repair shops have also skyrocketed due to increased demand. Ken Allen, service director of Johnnie Walker RV in Las Vegas, said his business and others have struggled to keep up, but the growing list of customers has made wait times double. Supply chain issues have made matters even worse, he said. ""So one of the (air conditioner) manufacturers – and there's only a couple – just quit answering their phone about a year ago. They were so overwhelmed,"" he said. Fisher has been trying to have a window in his RV fixed since November and has so far had no luck. ""It's probably less than an hour for them to repair it, but I can't get time,"" he said. Rebecca French of Clarksville, Indiana has been waiting to get her travel trailer into an auto shop for more than two weeks to fix a leaky tank. ""There are more people camping because I think they think this is a cheaper way to go ... (but) it's not as cheap as you might think,"" she said. RV TRAVEL: Take your road trip to the next level in one of these over-the-top camper vans or RVs Thomas Croft, who has been RVing full-time for six years, noted that campgrounds are also more expensive now that demand is through the roof. Before the pandemic, Croft estimated that a spot would cost $10 to $15 dollars a night, depending on location. Now, it's practically doubled. ""A couple years ago, I'd go to the campgrounds and there'd be a million spots open. Now, I go and I can barely get a spot. So I've got to call ahead,"" Croft said. ""It's changed a lot. There's more planning involved."" Fisher said he's also had to get used to planning out trips to keep mileage and costs down. ""It is a financial inconvenience,"" he said. ""I make my living on the road, so something has to give. I'm gonna have to raise prices or rethink it, and it's tough. I'm not sure that my customers are ready to accept a price increase at the moment."" Rebecca French of Clarksville, Indiana noted that rising costs are one reason why she hasn't been able to travel as much in her RV. She's considering selling her 18-foot Fleetwood Pioneer Spirit, although she may downsize rather than give up RV travel altogether. ""(My truck) gets about nine miles to the gallon, so that really has deterred me from doing what I want to do,"" French said. RV TRAVEL BOOM: More turn to RVs, motor homes to escape COVID-19 – and get away from it all Vickie Gould of Kingwood, Texas and her husband purchased a new Jayco Jay Flight in the summer of 2020 ""out of boredom"" in the early months of the pandemic, but didn't realize just how much prep work the RV required for each trip. Gould said she and her family ""went hardly anywhere"" with the brand-new RV the year they had it. They hooked it up at a friend's place twice, and there was one trip to a river in New Braunfels, Texas. It didn't go well. ""We had to stay five miles from the river because you couldn't find a spot,"" Gould said. ""It's still too busy."" And the difficulties around controlling a 31-foot RV didn't help the situation. ""We almost got a divorce trying to back it into the driveway,"" Gould said. ""It's hard work. It's scary."" At least selling it off was easy; Gould said they found a buyer online in just four days. ""My husband was so ready to rid of that thing, he said just give us the payoff and that's it. We gave them everything we had bought (for the RV),"" she said. Smith, the short-term RV owner from Flordia, also said finding a buyer was a breeze. After fixing up the RV a bit, she was able to hand it off the day it was posted on Facebook Marketplace for $14,000, roughly twice as much as her original purchase. That's not to say all new RV owners regret their purchase. Ter Veen said many of the people he works with are only selling to upgrade larger models. ""We are seeing a higher return rate for first-time buyers, where that first-time buyer may have waited four to six years before they upgraded to their second RV. We're seeing that timeframe shorten,"" he said. ""So our used inventory has spiked quite substantially in the last year."" Despite selling her RV last year, Gould said she has no regrets over her purchase and is considering purchasing another once she and her husband retire. ""I would love to do it again,"" she said. RV TRAVEL TIPS: How to rent an RV this summer without getting ripped off – literally or figuratively Smith said she's glad she got to dip her toes in the RV world, but warns potential buyers to weigh their options before making the purchase. ""The shine came off once I bought it,"" she said. ""We all watch the blogs or the YouTube videos and (RV life) looks so cool. … I thought we would visit all the national parks and honestly, we can. We can drive to them in a comfortable car, we can fly to them and stay in the parks. We can rent an RV for cheaper at this point."" Gould suggests people who are considering buying rent first to get a feel for it. And French, who is considering downsizing, said she has no regrets about her purchase. The 68-year-old has degenerative disc disease, which makes travel and sitting for long periods of time difficult. Despite the pain RV travel can induce, she said she's proud of the trips she was able to accomplish on her own. ""When I pulled my trailer out east to Maryland and parked my trailer right on the ocean, I was just so thrilled,"" she said. ""I would never discourage anyone from trying (RV travel). It's one of those things – if you don't try, you'll never know. … Don't hesitate. Life's too short.""
