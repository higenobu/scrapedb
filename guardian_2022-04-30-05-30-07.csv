4/30/2022,"My mum, Margaret Clowes, who has died aged 85, believed that every day was a chance to learn something new, see something different and enjoy a small sherry. Born in Mossley in Cheshire, the eldest of five, she lost hearing in one ear and suffered lung damage as a baby due to contracting measles and pneumonia, but neither impaired her abilities and zest for life. Her parents, Miriam (nee Eardley) and John Clowes, a lorry driver who became a master butcher, sent her to St Audrey’s, a Parents’ National Education Union school in Congleton, where she made lifelong friends and discovered a love of literature and art. In her teens she was an enthusiastic teenage member of the Biddulph Players amateur dramatics society, in the neighbouring Staffordshire town. On leaving Derby Teacher Training College, she careered around Europe on a scooter with her cousin Ruth, and in 1961 married Michael Fitt, a building society manager. With two daughters, Sally Ann (born in 1964) and me (1965), the family moved from London to south Wales, Northern Ireland to Yorkshire, then back to Wales and Lancashire. After the birth of her daughters, Margaret took up a post as an infants teacher at Kingsfield school in Biddulph, but the family’s subsequent moves made it impossible to sustain a career. So she took up other jobs, including as a shop assistant in a shoe shop and a hardware store, at an estate agents and as a civil servant in Cardiff, in the early to mid-80s. Moving back to Biddulph in 1986, followed by her divorce in 1987, Margaret typically embraced life with bravery and positivity, travelling to the US, Asia, Australia, north Africa and Europe. She also volunteered at Biddulph Grange, the National Trust-owned house, in whose magnificent gardens she had played for hours as a child. In 2007, Margaret moved to York, close to me and her much-loved granddaughters. A volunteer at York hospital for more than 10 years, she also became a volunteer guide at York Art Gallery, particularly for the Anthony Shaw Collection, built up over more than 40 years and on long-term loan to York Museums Trust. She had a diagnosis of breast cancer in late 2020, and a recurrence proved terminal. Anthony wrote to her in March this year: “Always a pleasure to see your smiling face and catch up with your lively descriptions of visitor reactions and your own to our new displays. The way you portrayed your own passions always enlivened my own visits, as it must have done to many visitors of all ages.” A beloved sister, friend, mum, granny and volunteer, whatever Margaret did and wherever she went, it was with determination and a vibrancy that was infectious. She is survived by her sisters, Marion and Miriam, brothers, John and Robert, daughters, Sally Ann and me, and granddaughters, Phoebe and Esmée.",News/Society,Margaret Clowes obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/29/margaret-clowes-obituary
4/30/2022,"In a judgment delivered this week, New Zealand’s high court found that elements of the country’s Managed Isolation and Quarantine (MIQ) system, the cornerstone of our world-leading pandemic response, were unlawful. The decision dropped to a good deal of delight. One well-known conservative commentator wrote: “So the courts have found the lockdown was illegal, the vaccine mandate was illegal and MIQ was illegal, so can anyone name a major aspect of the response that hasn’t been found to be illegal?” That response is predictably mischievous – none of those measures were ruled “illegal” – but it typifies the response. Perhaps the best-known of the conservative commentators involved wrote: “Jacinda Ardern has been found by the courts to have abused her powers by illegally preventing New Zealand citizens from leaving & returning home.” That isn’t what the high court found, but accurate reporting is hardly the point. In New Zealand the political right is fighting a relentless battle to rewrite the history of New Zealand’s pandemic success. For almost two years New Zealanders kept the virus from breaching the border. After the first lockdown in March 2020, Covid-19 was eliminated and New Zealanders went about their lives more or less as normal. Public health experts calculate that if we suffered the same rate of Covid-19 deaths as the UK, up to 10,000 people would be dead. That’s not far short of the number of New Zealanders who perished in the second world war. Add to those life-saving efforts the fact that the economy grew 14% in the third quarter of 2020 – the highest rate ever. That same year, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and her Labour party were re-elected in a landslide. Lockdowns are often given the credit for guaranteeing this success. Alert level 4 in March 2020 saw New Zealanders “stop the spread”, to resurrect an old phrase. Covid-19 cases fell to zero in June. Even in the more infectious and deadlier Delta outbreak, a strict lockdown beginning in August 2021 functionally eliminated Delta come the end of summer. But New Zealand’s primary defence was always MIQ. The system of isolation and quarantine for returning New Zealanders and visitors ensured that the virus rarely made it into the community. MIQers would spend two weeks in a hotel as a means of protecting the population. It was a necessary sacrifice and, in the scheme of things, a modest one. MIQ bought time for New Zealand to shelter as vaccines and antivirals were developed. The time it bought means that in the ongoing Omicron outbreak, with more than 90% of eligible adults vaccinated, the virus is proving no more fatal than the seasonal flu. This is something for which to thank MIQ, vaccine scientists, and public health providers (while acknowledging, of course, that even a single death from Omicron or the flu is a tragedy). And yet the political right is determined to rewrite this success. In a recent interview Chris Luxon, the National party leader, called on the government to abandon the traffic light system. Given the events of 2020 and 2021, that’s a bizarre intervention. Why would you take the side of the virus and let it really rip? But Luxon’s intervention highlights the relentless campaign to undermine New Zealand’s success. Not because recent memory of the pandemic is faulty – polls as early as this year reinforced majority support for the government’s response – but because critics of the government and Ardern sense an opportunity for the current and inevitable Omicron outbreak to define every outbreak that was prevented. This opportunity partly centres on criticism of the current spread and the pressure it places on an underfunded health system. The primary node of criticism, though, is the apparent threat to freedom and liberty that the government represents. In March and April countless stories were appearing criticising the red traffic light setting as having destroyed the hospitality sector. The loudest criticisms of MIQ, too, were often made by businesspeople keen to import workers without the need for limited MIQ spaces. Never mind the problem was, and, is the virus, not the efforts to control it. On a proper reading none of these criticisms – whether of MIQ or the traffic light settings – have much to do with freedom and liberty. These are calls for unrestrained commerce, the ability to trade no matter the circumstances. In their analysis, the right to conduct commerce, no matter what, was more important than any public health imperative. The clown convoy that made its way to Wellington – occupying parliament, destroying the grounds and impinging on the rights of Thorndon’s residents – was the sharp end of this “do what I want” attitude. We cannot let these people win. So many lives were saved in 2020 and 2021. The economy thrived. The government’s quick action gave us the time to vaccinate, preparing us for the Omicron outbreak, for which other countries that let the virus rip and mutate were responsible. The high court did find that the lottery aspect of MIQ was unlawful, but it acknowledged that MIQ itself was lawful, and that it was a justified and proportionate policy response in a pandemic. We should not forget that.

4/30/2022,"Was I the only person in the country to bang my head on the desk when Scott Morrison decided to goad Anthony Albanese about who had worked harder during their respective periods of Covid isolation? I doubt it. Given there are so many important things to talk about, washing up in a campaign telenovela, a man-off felt particularly grating – about as soothing as nails dragging down a chalk board. But once I’d stopped ranting to no one in particular about opportunity costs and diversions and the persistent absence of seriousness, once equanimity was restored, Morrison’s petty mind game assumed more interest, because it tells us something about where we are in this contest. I mean, we know that, in practical terms, of course. The calendar tells us we’ve reached the mid point of the campaign. But in reality, the contest begins this weekend. Australians have returned from holidays. Pre-poll voting opens in a week. Albanese is now out of isolation and has positioned in Perth for his official campaign launch on Sunday. Morrison’s prime ministership is now on the clock. Obviously Morrison put his prime ministership on the clock three weeks ago, when he drove out to see the governor general. But in the elasticities of campaign time, six weeks to polling day feels like an eternity, while three weeks feels like a nanosecond. My point is time always accelerates at the back end of a campaign. 21 May has assumed gravitational force. The contest has felt bogged and the tropes tired, but it is about to reset and sprint. Morrison is on the hunt for momentum. The apex predator is prowling on the range, looking for something he can use. Goading Albanese about his work ethic could just be a preschool sulk. The Labor leader’s proficiency with tactical retreats and dancing between the raindrops genuinely irritates Morrison. They are oil and water, these combatants, because Morrison lives to dominate and Albanese will prevail by default if that’s what the moment demands. But I don’t think it is a sulk. I think it’s a calculation. Morrison is trying to needle Albanese into what air force types call a performance take off – where the jet screams down the runway and hurtles into the sky like a rocket. Morrison’s hint of Albanese malingering, or hiding, is a provocation intended to elicit a response, and the prime minister has accompanied the editorialising with a concrete demand that Albanese agree to two leaders debates on commercial television next week. The goading surfaces deep need. Morrison needs Albanese back centre stage to make what remains of the contest a referendum on the Labor leader’s competence. You can’t pin a competitor who isn’t in the ring. Having had Covid himself, Morrison knows the lingering after effects of the virus are fatigue and brain fog. Debates, after a day of campaigning, are gruelling encounters, physically and mentally, even for seasoned professionals. So Morrison’s calculation is simple: Albanese is significantly more likely to make a mistake when he’s not 100%. Again, time is of the essence. Morrison knows he’s got to find a pivot point in the campaign, and finding it is all on him. The prime minister has three weeks to convince voters that Albanese represents unacceptable risk. At the moment swinging voters are hesitant about the Labor leader. A chunk aren’t yet convinced he’s the antidote for their dissatisfaction. Morrison has to shift that voter hesitation to outright risk aversion. But the problem is the prime minister’s own credibility has taken a hammering. Morrison can contend Albanese constitutes risk (and does in disciplined fashion most days on the hustings) but his disapproval is now so high, voters will discount what they hear. So Morrison needs Albanese to make that case for him. He needs Albanese to demonstrate that he is out of his depth. Now Albanese helped with that mission during the first week of the campaign with his stumble on the cash rate and unemployment rate. That vision is in the bank. The Liberals can deploy it in the barrage of negative advertising that generally happens in the closing weeks of a campaign, and the message pretty much writes itself. If the Reserve Bank hikes interest rates, or even if it doesn’t, I’d expect to see Liberal advertisements telling voters if Albanese doesn’t know what the cash rate is, how can you trust him to keep rates low? So Morrison has that. It feels necessary but not sufficient. So he is hungry for more fallibility to weaponise. So we have the stupid mind game about debates. Morrison has agreed to debates on Nine and Seven next week and demanded Albanese turn up. Thus far he’s blanked a request from the ABC and a seperate demand from Labor to front the National Press Club in the final week of the campaign. The choice of debate venues is interesting. It tells us with some precision who the prime minister wants to speak with – and I don’t mean the political editors of the networks, Mark Riley and Chris Uhlmann. I’m talking about viewers. Fascinating research from a couple of years ago examining Australian media audience polarisation found viewers of commercial TV networks and the subscription channel Sky News are more right-leaning than the ABC television audience, which attracts viewers evenly from across the political spectrum. Morrison agreed to the first debate, hosted by Sky News, and now wants more time on Seven and Nine. While it’s possible Morrison ends up in a debate hosted by the ABC, or one moderated by Laura Tingle at the National Press Club, it’s more than reasonable to speculate he’d rather avoid both. Wanting the leaders debate on Nine and Seven tells us Morrison is still trying to shore up elements of his base flirting with a protest vote. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It also tells us he’s on the hunt for voters in Labor’s column who can be recruited on cultural affinity grounds. Some in the government say Morrison is holding up well enough in regional Queensland and in the outer suburbs of big cities. You hear there’s not a lot of warmth for Albanese on this terrain. But there’s also a growing sense that Liberal incumbents are in serious trouble in metropolitan contests with teal independents – that a number of these seats could fall. You hear the same story from different people on high rotation: Liberal moderates are getting a positive reception themselves from constituents, but Morrison is absolutely, irredeemably, toxic. It’s possible this pessimism is being promulgated deliberately as part of a mind focusing exercise – if voters in progressive Liberal heartland are led to believe courtesy of precision backgrounding of journalists that their protest vote will actually work, and possibly even install a Labor government, then they might think twice about voting for Allegra Spender or Zoe Daniel or Kylea Tink. But if the doom and gloom isn’t tactical, if it reflects reality, then Morrison’s only hope of remaining in power is trying to boost the Coalition’s primary vote in areas of the country where that’s possible, and grabbing seats in the Labor column to offset losses in the teal contests. If he can’t do that, it’s over.

4/30/2022,"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. Analysis by Julian Borger explained how a series of mysterious explosions in Moldova has raised the threat of Russia’s war in Ukraine spilling over into new territory, with unpredictable consequences. Separatist authorities in the Moscow-backed region of Transnistria have blamed the incidents on Ukrainian infiltrators, while the Kyiv government alleged they were false-flag attacks designed to provide a pretext for an infusion of Russian troops, just as similar blasts in the Donbas preceded the 24 February Russian invasion of Ukraine. A Russian move into Transnistria would pose an imminent threat to the sovereignty of Moldova, which, like Ukraine, has shown increasing interest in joining Nato. On Thursday, Moldova’s deputy prime minister, Nicu Popescu, said the attacks represented “a very dangerous new moment in the history of our region”. One of Europe’s poorest countries, Moldova is grappling with a large influx of refugees and the economic fallout of the war, which has stopped nearly 15% of its exports. With the start of this new phase in the war, a layer is being stripped away from the buffer that has thus far kept Nato and Russia from coming into direct, hostile contact, during the cold war and since, Borger writes. And if the ominous explosions in Transnistria are auguries of a new Putin gambit, Moldova could find itself to be the next proving ground where this dangerous new world makes itself felt. Dan Boffey in Brussels, Philip Olterman in Berlin and Rob Davies in London wrote about the consequences for Europe after Russia halted gas supplies to two EU countries and threatened others, in a move condemned by European leaders as blackmail. The move, described by Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, as a “direct attack” on his country, was justified by the Kremlin as a response to a failure of the two countries to comply with demands for payments to be made in roubles. It has led, however, to a dangerous standoff as Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said any EU country giving in to Russia by paying for gas in roubles would be in breach of the bloc’s sanctions regime, with which the UK and others have acted in lockstep. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst for the UK and Europe at the foreign exchange company Oanda, said: “This may be a warning sign to others in the hope that they don’t follow suit, but if they do, the standoff could play havoc with energy prices. With the Kremlin putting itself in a position where it must apply the same punishment to all if they don’t comply, Europe may find itself without Russian gas or looking weak.” Hungary has said it is happy to pay in roubles and, according to reports, three of Europe’s biggest gas companies – Germany’s Uniper, Italy’s Eni and Austria’s OMV – are also examining ways to comply with Putin’s decree. In a separate piece of analysis, Rob Davies asks: how worried should Europe be? Isobel Koshiw visited Zaporizhzhia, the only large city in south-east Ukraine under Ukrainian control. It has become a destination for the hundreds of thousands of people who fled Russian occupation, but with 70% of the wider region under Russian military control, there are fears that Moscow’s forces will attempt to take it. As preparations for the arrival of the war get under way, life in the city is surprisingly normal – even busy – for wartime Ukraine. “You can see for yourself people are out, going to work – the city is prepared but it won’t come to that,” said Ivan Ariefiev, the press secretary of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, at one of a series of war-related training courses being offered to the city’s teachers and journalists. Attendees, who are then expected to train the wider community, were taught how to load a gun, administer first aid and do a basic medical evaluation.  Fléchettes are rarely used in modern warfare. Small, metal and sharp like a dart, thousands can be stored inside each shell. Once fired, the shell will detonate on a timer, spreading the tiny arrows far and wide. The weapon was used in the first world war – dropped from airplanes to pierce the helmets of enemy infantry. Now, they are being removed from the heads and chests of civilians in Ukraine. Lorenzo Tondo reported on the discovery of the tiny metal arrows in bodies of men and women in mass graves, allegedly killed during the Russian occupation of Bucha, Ukraine. “We found several really thin, nail-like objects in the bodies of men and women and so did others of my colleagues in the region,” Vladyslav Pirovskyi, a Ukrainian forensic doctor, told the Guardian. “It is very hard to find those in the body, they are too thin. The majority of these bodies come from the Bucha-Irpin region.” Russian forces captured Bucha, 30km north-west of Kyiv, after ferocious fighting following Russia’s invasion in February. Towards the end of March, mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of people who had apparently been massacred came to light. As defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh explains, the west’s war aims are expanding. On Monday, Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, said the west’s goal was to “weaken Russia” to the point where it could no longer threaten its neighbours. A day later, the British junior defence minister James Heappey said it would be “completely legitimate” for Ukraine to use western weapons to strike inside Russia. On Wednesday, western officials said they would like to see Ukraine restored to the boundaries existing before 24 February – the start of the Russian invasion – “as a minimum”. With Ukraine unable to achieve that objective on its own, the question will become how much more Britain and other Nato members are prepared to commit. On Wednesday, the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, appeared very committed, adopting in her speech the most uncompromising of approaches to a final peace settlement: endorsing the measures above but also reparations – a payment to Ukraine for the damage Moscow had inflicted – in an echo of the principles followed by allied forces against Germany in 1919. Discussions on how to define failure in any peace settlement are at an early stage among the cell of diplomats from “the Quad” – the US, UK, France and Germany – discussing the issue. The discussions will evolve as the battlefield evolves.

4/30/2022,"Vivien Pailas has one piece of advice for anyone hunting for a rental property in Sydney: “Lower your expectations.” Pailas relocated back to Australia in February with her British husband, Simon Myall, and her five-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Georgia, after 15 years living in London. She didn’t expect it would take 35 house inspections and a rental agent to secure her family a home. “We got here in early February, and my wrong assumption was we’d just get an Airbnb for a few weeks. “I knew [the rental market] was difficult. I was on Facebook groups that were talking about how hard things were. But I thought, we’ve got money in the bank, my husband has a good job … I didn’t anticipate it would take so long and be so difficult. “We stayed at my parents’ for the first week. Then 10 days after we arrived, I booked an Airbnb on the northern beaches for a week while I started the rental search. “It was just crazy, there were people lining up at the front of the houses, lines of people snaking down the road, it was really disheartening. “I extended the Airbnb for a week, then we had to leave and I got another [one]. My husband was working in makeshift accommodation and I was having to entertain my five-and-a-half-year-old and dragging her around viewings, it was all getting really stressful so we ended up going back to my parents. “Because we didn’t have a permanent address, I couldn’t get her into school, so I tried to get her into childcare but I couldn’t because of her age. She was crying every night, really unsettled … it was all just a nightmare. “Then a friend suggested a rental agent, because we were going to a lot of viewings where the houses were nothing like the photos on the website, really misleading, so you’d walk in and walk straight back out again. “We were looking at approximately $1,000 per week for a three-bedroom house … a very decent budget for suburbs in the inner west and in the Lane Cove area on the lower north shore. We applied for a few places in Lane Cove and didn’t get them. “They were properties that were in really good condition, renovated, all the mod cons. “These were the properties that were in demand the most, because many places were quite old and nothing had been done to them. It was very deflating finding a place you really liked and could see yourself living in, then not getting it. “I went to some places that were just dumps. “There was one instance where we walked into a property that still had the current tenants living there and the place was disgusting. It had clothes everywhere, dirty dishes in the sink, muddy floors and smelt like mould. We walked straight back out again. “Others – the photos were really, really old. Or they’d put one or two photos and that’s it. And there was high competition – we were applying and not getting houses, even offering three months’ rent upfront. “So I had to pay for the privilege [of a rental agent] to get a property … which I think is just ludicrous. I didn’t even know they existed. “The fact the service exists is really telling of how dire the market is. And we’re lucky we can afford it. It’s an extra expense we didn’t budget for, but we had to suck it up. “She started helping us narrowing down areas – because the ones we were looking at were so in demand and the stock was so low, there just weren’t enough rental properties, and the competition was so fierce, we had to look elsewhere. “I had coaching from her on how to secure a property – how to introduce yourself and be memorable. She also told us to get references from old neighbours to say what respectable people we were, and to apply for properties before we’d seen them. “It’s ridiculous talking about it, but that was our reality – going to viewings and trying to schmooze the rental agent, saying ‘Hi! We’re the couple that just moved from London, we’ve got a small child and we love the area!’ “I probably did about 20 inspections, and then the rental agent did another 15 before we eventually found a rental property in April. And we were ready. We knew what we needed to say, what we needed to offer, we were primed and got it. “We settled on something in Lindfield, on the upper north shore, that didn’t tick all the boxes, but it will do. “We’ve definitely gone over budget, but we just needed a place to live and to get my daughter into school. It’s not in the area we wanted to live in and it’s $300 more per week than we wanted to spend. “But its got space for my husband and [me] to work from home, and we wanted outdoor space because we didn’t have that luxury in London. We wanted to live in a house – and that’s where the problem is, there’s really high demand for houses, and they’re really, really expensive. “You can search properties and see how much tenants are paying for rent. And in most cases, rentals we were looking at were increasing rent by $50 to $100 a week … they’re just taking advantage of the crisis. “London’s rental market is pricey depending on where you live. But there’s a stack more properties available. Here, there’s just not enough houses to go around. “We’re just really relieved we actually have a place to live, not crashing at my parents’ house in one tiny spare room for three of us.” Have you had a bad experience with the rental market?

4/30/2022,"With all eyes fixed on the federal election campaign, you’d be forgiven for nearly forgetting Victoria’s treasurer, Tim Pallas, is set to hand down a state budget in a couple of days. So far, all we know is that health will be a main theme of the pre-election budget. Improving lengthy ambulance wait times, emergency department overcrowding and the state’s triple zero call-taking system are front of mind after several much-publicised deaths, including that of a 72-year-old man who waited more than three hours for a bed at a regional hospital earlier this month. “It will be a very big budget for those basic services that make a massive difference to people’s lives,” premier Daniel Andrews said at a recent press conference. “You’ll see short, medium and long-term investments in the budget that are about supporting our nurses, our ambos, our call takers to do more, to do better, and to provide the best care that we could possibly provide.” In terms of pre-budget announcements, at the time of writing just $277.5m has been allocated – to combine the Victorian Certificate of Education and the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning from next year. By way of comparison, days out from last year’s budget, $4.2bn worth of spending and $2.7bn in new taxes had already been announced, as had the state’s deficit figure. It’s not surprising the state government is holding off on any significant announcements during the federal election campaign, when it risks either being ignored or conflated with federal Labor. But any spending will also inevitably lead to talk about the state’s debt and the government’s plans to pay it off. Pallas is midway through his four-step fiscal strategy, first unveiled in 2020 as the state emerged from an extended lockdown after its second wave of Covid-19. Step one – creating jobs, reducing unemployment and restoring economic growth – has largely been achieved, given the state unemployment stands at a low 4.2% and the workforce participation rate is high. Step two – returning to an operating cash surplus – is also well on its way, with a $2.5bn cash surplus included in last year’s budget for 2022/23. Steps three and four – returning to operating surpluses and stabilising debt levels – will probably be a priority in this year’s budget, particularly if the government wants to fend off any attacks from the opposition ahead of November’s poll. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Victoria carries the largest debt load of all the states and territories. As per the latest budget update, net debt is set to hit $104.5bn – or 21.1% of gross state product by June this year. This is expected to grow to $162.7bn – or 27.9% – by 2024/25, $6.4bn more than initially forecast, largely due to additional government support during the third wave of Covid-19 in 2021. Pallas has maintained the debt is manageable, citing low interest rates and the state’s swift recovery from the pandemic. This is despite concerns from ratings agencies Moody’s and S&P, who both downgraded the state’s AAA credit rating after the 2020/21 budget. Interest expense as a share of total revenue is expected to average 5% a year over the budget and forward estimates. It will be interesting to see if this figure changes come Tuesday, given it’s all but guaranteed interest rates will rise. So what will the government do? It’s unlikely it will introduce any new taxes to pay down the debt – especially in an election year, where cost of living remains chief among voters’ concerns. Indeed, a policy to tax property developers in order to fund social housing was scrapped just 10 days after it was announced in February, partly due to concerns it handed the opposition a golden opportunity to target the government over housing affordability. Earlier this month, Pallas said he was “not in the business of austerity” but seemed to flag possible cuts to the public service. “I don’t believe that austerity is the way to economic growth. There are more efficient ways to spend. We’ve put in place arrangements such as base reviews on departmental spending … and we continue to be committed to making sure we run an efficient budget,” he said. In 2019, the government outlined a plan to cut $1.7bn from state government department budgets, though it was largely put on hold due to the pandemic. Earlier this week, Pallas told The Age he was committed to the savings. The Community and Public Sector Union maintains the public service is still playing catch up post-Covid, clearly in health, but also in areas such as child protection, justice, licensing and registration. It’s easy to see – given the complexities of balancing Victoria’s budget and the likelihood that some will be unhappy come Tuesday afternoon – why the state government is happy with the attention being diverted elsewhere.",News/Australia news,Victoria’s government quietly prepares an election budget while attention is diverted,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/30/victorias-government-quietly-prepares-an-election-budget-while-attention-is-diverted
4/30/2022,"On a Friday afternoon in April 1979, John Mainstone, a physics professor at the University of Queensland, rang his wife at home. He wouldn’t be back that evening, he told her. For the previous 18 years, Mainstone had looked after the pitch drop experiment, a long-form demonstration of the extreme viscosity of pitch. For the first time since August 1970, the pitch was about to drip from its funnel, and Mainstone didn’t want to miss it. Pitch is a resin – a viscoelastic substance derived from petroleum or coal tar, used in bitumen, and for waterproofing. Which is ironic, for as solid as it appears, pitch is fluid: at least, it is when you put it in a funnel, the sloping sides of which create a pressure gradient. Mainstone stayed up all that Friday night. He continued to keep watch on the Saturday, eventually ringing his wife back to tell her he wouldn’t be home that night, either. Still, the globule of (literally) pitch-black liquid hung by a thread from the bottom of its funnel. On Sunday evening, exhausted by his vigil, he went home. By the time he returned to work on a sleep-deprived Monday morning, the pitch had dropped into its beaker. The pitch drop experiment,was set up by Mainstone’s predecessor Thomas Parnell. In 1927 Parnell heated and liquefied some pitch, poured it into a sealed funnel, and set it over the beaker inside a large bell jar. In 1930, he cut the stem of the funnel – and waited. Nearly a century later, the original experiment – which has become the longest running laboratory experiment in the world – stands in the foyer of the physics building in the Great Court. The jar is set inside a protective plastic cube, with an analogue Casio desk clock observing each moment as students and staff wander past. The funnel is held aloft by a brass tripod; at the bottom, a shiny black balloon of pitch hovers above the empty beaker. It was Mainstone, taking the experiment on in 1961, who brought the pitch drop to popular attention. He also mentored its third and current custodian, Professor Andrew White, who has watched over it since Mainstone’s death in 2013. Like Parnell, Mainstone died without ever seeing a single drop fall. “I am in no way filling John’s shoes,” White insists. “He was the heart and soul of this.” Mainstone’s dedication was legendary. In 2005, he and (posthumously) Parnell were awarded the Ig Nobel prize – a satirical award noting arcane and trivial achievements in scientific research. The Ig Nobel prize aims to honour work that makes people laugh, but also makes them think. Author Nick Earls first encountered the experiment as a medical student at UQ in the early 1980s, later writing about it in his novel Perfect Skin. “It was a demonstration that all is not necessarily as it seems,” he says. “There is pitch – something that goes into the making of roads, something we think of as totally solid – and it turns out it’s not. It’s just 230m times more viscous than water, and it flows, albeit very slowly.” How slowly? “Far slower than grass growing, far slower than paint drying,” White says, mock-offended by such banal comparisons (and the suggestion that this could be, well, a rather dull experiment to watch). “We’re talking more than 10 times slower than continental drift!” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He directs my attention to the joining of four tiles on the floor. “Those tiles are moving north at 68 millimetres a year, because Australia is moving north at 68 millimetres a year. It’s one of the fastest continents, as far as continental drift goes. The pitch drop is moving at least 10 times slower than that! So it’s literally slower than watching Australia drift north, and people log in live on the internet to watch it. Which I find really fascinating.” It’s true. More than 35,000 people in 160 countries are sweating on the 10th drop of pitch. They’ll be waiting a while yet. Since Parnell cut the stem of the funnel in 1930, just nine drops have fallen: in December 1938, February 1947, April 1954, May 1962, August 1970, April 1979, July 1988 (when it became a popular exhibit at Brisbane’s generation-defining Expo 1988), November 2000 and April 2014. White prefers to call the pitch drop a demonstration, rather than an experiment, as it has never been controlled, and thus has been subject to environmental fluctuations. For its first 30 years, it sat in a cool dark cupboard. Mainstone put it on display, and the pitch maintained its average of one drop every eight years until, in the 80s, the physics building (which is named after Parnell) was air-conditioned, which blew it out to every 13 years or so. Sometimes, the sensitivity of the pitch to environmental conditions was forgotten. “At one stage, someone swapped the fluorescent lights above the display, which were very cool, to halogens, which are very hot,” White says, shaking his head. “No one asked anyone to change it, it was just done, and I realised that the pitch – which is normally at room temperature – was sitting at 60 degrees. The halogens are about 120, so it was flowing like a tap.” And yet, to this day, no one has seen a drop fall. Not at Expo (White: “There were four or five people watching it, it was a hot day, I think they went out for five minutes to get some cordial”), not even when a live stream was first set up for the millennial event in 2000. Mainstone was watching from London at the time.On that occasion a classic Brisbane thunderstorm disrupted the power supply, cutting the lights and camera feed. Mainstone died of a stroke in 2013. In a cruel twist, the last drop fell in April 2014, a few months after his death. Except, it didn’t technically drop. It just sort of oozed into the eight drops that had already fallen and solidified in the small beaker sitting under the funnel in a bell jar, without breaking away. Reluctantly, White swapped the beaker over, managing to source an old imperial-measurement model to match the original. Since then, the beaker has sat in place – clean, empty, yet to be blackened by a single drop of goo. The lights have been replaced with LEDs. “We had a very fresh start,” White says. “And so, when anyone asks me when it will drop, I can genuinely say that I have no idea. Because the conditions have changed, as they have throughout most of the last 95 years. It’s never been kept constant.” Just a few meters below the pitch drop experiment is a basement dedicated to quantum technology. There, White says, a lab makes pulses of light that are one hundred million billionth of a second long. And here in front of us, he says proudly, “we have something that has an event every 10 to 20 years! It really captures the different timescales of the physical world around us.” He looks at the funnel. There is still quite a bit of pitch in there. The experiment, he says, will long outlive all of us. “Quantum mechanics is as far as you can get from bits of coal that have been heated up and are slowly pouring through a glass tube as you can get,” he says. “I am glad that we got a new beaker in there, that will be good for another 100 years or so. Two, three keepers from now, it’ll be their problem what to do next.”",News/Education,‘It’s literally slower than watching Australia drift north’: the laboratory experiment that will outlive us all,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/30/its-literally-slower-than-watching-australia-drift-north-the-laboratory-experiment-that-will-outlive-us-all
4/30/2022,"Clive Palmer’s centrepiece campaign pledge to cap homeowners’ interest rates for five years has been dismissed by economists as “radical”, “crazy” and “utterly irresponsible” even though it will probably appeal to some gullible voters. According to the United Australia party’s website, the mining billionaire’s “economic plan for freedom and prosperity” pledges to set a maximum 3% interest rate for all home loans to head off a looming mass default as lending rates start to rise. Wednesday’s surprisingly large 5.1% consumer price inflation figure has stoked expectations the Reserve Bank will be forced to lift its cash rate target from 0.1% when its board meets on Tuesday. Market home loans rates have been rising for months, with most fixed rates now between 3% and 5% with variable rates above 2%. “If our interest rate for home loans doubles from 2% to 4%, 60% of all mortgages will be in default and if the interest rate goes to between 6% to 8%, as it most surely will, the default rate will be greater than 90%,” Palmer said, citing unnamed “other studies”. Elsewhere on UAP’s website, Palmer blames the $1tn debt racked up by the Liberal and Labor governments as the trigger for the rising interest rates. “The real estate market will then collapse and foreign buyers will flood our real estate market as they will have the money to buy up our properties,” his national policy states. “We have to stop Australians from losing their homes!” Guardian Australia sought comment from the UAP and Craig Kelly, the ex-Liberal MP and now UAP candidate for the NSW seat of Hughes on how the rate cap would work. News Corp tabloids cited Kelly as saying the federal government could implement the plan by selling Treasury bonds at 0.1% to 0.2% and “on-lending that cheap cash to retail banks” who would then keep the mortgage rate under 3%. Anna Bligh, chief executive of the Australian Banking Association, called the plan “magic pudding economics” that would “wreak havoc across banking and financial services sector” if ever implemented, according to the papers. Alan Oster, NAB’s chief economist, said his bank typically avoided comment on such policies. “I don’t know how [Palmer] would implement it other than re-regulating rates, and that would be radically different,” Oster said. “Who knows how they would do that?” Saul Eslake, an independent economist who formerly worked at ANZ Bank, said it was “constitutionally and legally possible” for an Australian government to impose a legislated ceiling on mortgage rates. Up until the late 1980s, such a ceiling existed, at the treasurer’s discretion. However, Eslake said “it would be an utterly irresponsible thing for any government to seek to do”, given the different conditions more than three decades on. Timo Henckel, from the Australian National University’s Research School of Economics, said while he had scant details, the policy “doesn’t sound workable”. One approach could be to intervene to set “severe financial market regulation”. That would “take us back to, say, the 1970s”, and would be at odds with the liberalised capital markets that Australia now operates, he said. The other possibility would be for the central bank to provide a standing facility to pump as much money into financial markets needed to keep interest rates at 3%, Henckel said. Such a move, though, would be a “crazy policy because there’d be so much liquidity sloshing around in the system”, resulting in more inflation. In addition, “it would really only work if they seriously compromised the RBA’s independence … and [would] require massive legal intervention in a way that I’m not even sure they’d be able to do it”, he said. Australia’s banks, meanwhile, rely on international capital markets to source a significant share of their own funds, and would find it harder to raise money in such a distorted system. “They’re never going to be asked to implement it anyway so really it’s just an attention grabber in order get votes,” Henckel said. “It’s not a genuine policy.”",News/Australia news,"Clive Palmer’s campaign pledge to cap home loan rates ‘utterly irresponsible’, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/30/clive-palmers-campaign-pledge-to-cap-home-loan-rates-utterly-irresponsible-experts-say
4/30/2022,"Staring at the camera, Anto’s face, wide-eyed and child-like, invites a simple question. How could anyone, let alone Australia’s federal crime fighting agency, see an adult gazing back at them? Anto was 15 in June 2009 when he was on a fishing boat carrying 50 Afghan and Iranian asylum seekers that was intercepted near Ashmore Reef. From a poor Indonesian village, he jumped at a vague offer of work aboard the boat. He had no idea he was going to Australia. All he knew was the money would help his family survive. When the boat was intercepted, interview transcripts show, Anto told Australian authorities in no uncertain terms he was a child, born on 14 April 1994. Under Australian federal police policy, he should have been sent home. Instead, police relied on a deeply flawed X-ray technique to deem him an adult. The date of birth Anto gave police was altered to 14 April 1991, and the new date was included on his prosecution notice, a sworn document seen by Guardian Australia. With the flick of a pen, Anto suddenly became an adult. The Guardian has obtained images of Anto when he was first detained by Australian authorities. They show, for the first time, the child-like face law enforcement encountered after the 2009 interception. Despite his insistence that he was 15, police relied on the wrist X-ray and hauled Anto before the Western Australian district court, where he was prosecuted as an adult and sentenced to five years in an adult maximum security facility in Perth. Police had changed Anto’s date of birth to fit with an X-ray taken of his wrist, which their preferred radiologist used to deem his bone mature. Using a reference tool based on the bones of healthy, middle-class Americans, the doctor made an assumption that the wrist bone generally matures at the age of 19. “It is [a] reasonable interpretation that Mr Anto is older than 19 years of age,” the radiologist told police. The technique has now been completely discredited. Colin Singer, then an independent prison visitor, found Anto in the WA jail system back in 2010 and has been fighting for justice for him and other children jailed as adult people smugglers ever since. Singer still remembers his shock at seeing someone clearly so young being held in an adult jail. “They were all nice kids, but he was one of the ones who stood out. He was a really, really nice kid,” Singer said. “They were tiny … they not only looked like kids, they acted like kids.” On Tuesday, six other Indonesians won a fight to overturn their convictions and clear their names, redressing an injustice allowed by grave failures of police, prosecutors and the federal government. The court ruled a “substantial miscarriage of justice” had occurred in their cases due to the reliance on wrist X-rays. But Anto’s conviction still stands. For him and one other Indonesian, Samsul Bahar, the road to justice is not so clear. Both appealed against their convictions on unrelated grounds while still behind bars, exhausting their appeal rights. They were eventually released in 2012 and returned to Indonesia, where they remain. Now, more than 10 years later, both are left relying heavily on a referral from the federal attorney general to lodge a fresh appeal against their convictions in the WA courts. Their plea came before the former attorney general Christian Porter in 2020, who refused to assist them, saying they had no prospect of success. Guardian Australia revealed this week that Porter had denied referrals in similar cases, despite having prior involvement in the issue as the WA corrections minister in 2009 and 2010. As corrections minister, Porter had received a complaint warning him he had children in his government’s jails. In a letter in December 2010, seen by Guardian Australia, Porter relied on the wrist X-rays and said: “None of the prisoners currently in departmental prisons have been verified as being under the age of 18.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Singer said it was sad the Australian government was still denying culpability for what it did to the children. “I think this injustice has gone on long enough,” he said. “It doesn’t reflect well that in Australia, as a country, we would treat young children like this, of any nationality, of any race, of any religion.” The Australian federal police had reason to doubt the reliability of the X-ray evidence long before the cases against Anto, Samsul and the other children in 2010. They were involved in a 2002 case in which a court heard serious concerns about the technique’s reliability. The immigration department had also sounded the alarm internally to the government about wrist X-rays before the convictions of Anto and Samsul. A briefing to the federal government warned against relying on wrist X-rays and pointed to the UK guidelines on the practice, which categorically stated the technique should not be used to determine age.

Last year, Branson told Guardian Australia she thought at the time political pressure was felt by the government agencies responsible for investigating and prosecuting smuggling. “I concluded that these agencies wanted to be seen to be bringing prosecutions and securing significant penalties. They wanted to be seen to be taking people-smuggling seriously. “They wanted to find some way to determine age, there was a high level of anxiety to find a biological marker that could tell you precisely how old a person was, but, in the end, their reliance on the wrist X-rays proved to be ill-founded.” The approach of Porter in denying referrals to the children diverged from that of former attorney general George Brandis. Brandis received the same request in 2015 from lawyers for another boy, Ali Jasmin, who was jailed when he was 12. The wrist X-ray technique had deemed him an adult. Brandis referred the case to the WA court of appeal and Jasmin’s conviction was ultimately overturned.",News/Australia news,‘They were tiny’: the Indonesians still fighting their conviction as adults in Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/30/they-were-tiny-the-indonesians-still-fighting-their-conviction-as-adults-in-australia
4/30/2022,"Scott Morrison’s comment last month that “the best way to support people renting a house is to help them buy a house” was seized on by some as a “let them eat cake moment”. The prime minister was responding to a question from Channel Nine’s Today Show about why the federal budget hadn’t done more for renters. The query was unusual because renters typically get far less heed from media and politicians than homeowners, despite them making up about a third – and rising – share of the population. The scant attention is curious given the plight of renters is generally deteriorating nationwide. According to CoreLogic, average rents rose 12.9% in the two years to March, which is seven times the 1.8% increase of the preceding two-year period. The well-publicised outflow of city folk to the regions during Covid is also making it worse for locals. Regional rents have increased a fifth in those two years, or double the pace of the increase in state capitals, CoreLogic data shows. Groups from the Australian Council of Social Service to the Committee for Sydney have led calls to address housing affordability that have produced little substantial policy from the major parties, at least federally. That results fall so far short of needs reveal much about the sort of society we live in and where we’re headed. That is, one with a falling share of people owning their homes in almost all age groups. As one senior member of the NSW government told me recently, housing has gone from an essential “roof over our heads” to a commodity for wealth accumulation and speculation. Federal and state policies had largely served to steer ever more money into the sector, favouring those already in the market. The media, too, seems conflicted. Open up a newspaper, particularly on a Saturday, and readers can ogle glossy property magazines and articles touting celebrities trading trophy homes. Both News Corp and Nine Entertainment, the nation’s dominant media groups, rely after all on the property-spruiking REA Group and Domain, respectively, to shore up revenues. Cost of living issues alone suggest more coverage on rents is warranted. Within the basket of goods and services that the Bureau of Statistics uses to track consumer price increases, rents carry twice the weight of transport fuel. Despite that, they drew far fewer stories than “pain at the bowser” tales that recently panicked the government into halving the fuel excise until after the election. Regional renters, though, have an extra reason to feel neglected. The ABS bases the rental weighting within the CPI on capital cities only, meaning the recent run-up in regional rentals has not been picked up in the inflation figures. The latest data, out on Wednesday, showed rents rising again in all cities, including Melbourne and Sydney which had been hard hit by the absence of foreign students during the Covid lockdowns. A revival of migration will accelerate those rises. Housing issues have been slow to become a focus in the campaign, despite rising expectations the Reserve Bank will soon start lifting interest rates – and keep raising them for the next couple of years – to stem inflation. ASX futures market shows investors predict the RBA's cash rate will be at 2.5% by the end of 2022, whether or not the central bank makes its first move on 3 May. #ausvotes #auspol pic.twitter.com/B2O25E5vm9 As another instance, the Greens’ promise of 1 million more low-cost homes, the most ambitious of the parties in the election, was all but ignored despite the policy making up a large part of Adam Bandt’s National Press Club speech on 13 April. The media instead focused on the Greens leader’s “Google it, mate” slapdown, and pledges to aid dental care and halt coal and gas projects. The omission surprised advisers who remain keen to get the issue back in the spotlight. The policy would not come cheap, decreasing the fiscal balance by $7.5bn and the headline cash balance by $30.8bn over the budget forward estimates period, the Parliamentary Budget Office said. For the ALP, the top task is 30,000 “new social and affordable housing properties” over the first five years. The Coalition, meanwhile, is stressing home ownership, while “incentivising” regional home construction. In a comprehensive study for the Australian Council for Social Service Acoss led by University of New South Wales professor Hal Pawson, the authors examined how governments dealt with Covid from a housing perspective, and what it revealed about their priorities. “Income support did more to absorb the income shock of the pandemic, to a significant extent letting housing policy and, especially, landlords, off the hook,” they said. “Restrictions on evictions and rent increases were lifted just as many regions were seeing a major escalation in rents and tightening availability.” “This strengthens the sense that housing policy objectives around affordability, security and prevention of homelessness are still lower priorities than maintenance of housing asset values, rent revenues and loan serviceability,” they said. Pawson said that while the house price cycle was likely to be near its top, ahead of those RBA rate rises, rents would probably keep rising. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Pawson cites 1996, the year the Howard government took office, as a “break point” when the annual national social housing construction program finished. Since then Australia’s population has swelled 30%, but the stock of social housing has grown only 4% even taking in a burst of spending during the global financial crisis by the Rudd government. “In the last few years, we’ve only barely been building enough to make good the loss from demolition and sales every year,” Pawson said. In the past 10 years, social housing has made up just 1% to 2% of new homes built. By contrast, in the quarter-century after 1945, one in six homes were public housing. “There is a historical precedent for this in Australia, of the state being a substantial source of housing production,” Pawson said. “It’s just we’ve forgotten that we ever did it.”",News/Australia news,"Locked out: housing has become a path to wealth, but renters have been left behind",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/30/locked-out-housing-has-become-a-path-to-wealth-but-renters-have-been-left-behind
4/30/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is pretending to shop. “Where’s my basket?” he asks, sparking a flurry among advisers to source a shopping basket. A trolley? (Nope, Morrison signals with his eyes.) A branded hessian bag? “Perfect. Let’s go!” “So where’s your turmeric coming from? “Ah Bundaberg. Great.“I prefer using fresh turmeric when I cook.” “I like to cook. That and swimming. It keeps me sane.” Morrison tells Dom at Doblo’s Farmers Market he plans to cook a “veggie curry for the girls” back in Sydney on Saturday night. He adds fresh galangal to the bag. “Can’t have too many of these,” he says of Tasmanian shallots, grabbing a few handfuls. “Where’s the garlic from?” Peru. That gets left on the pile. Onions? Plenty of those at home. “Ah, taro”! He says, as if greeting an old friend. Okra jumps in. Baby eggplants – like the ones “Jen and the girls” grew in Canberra. A pomegranate. A cauliflower. Watching the prime minister winding through the cool rooms, making small talk with owner Dom Doblo, filling his bag with fruit and veg, it’s possible just for a moment to suspend disbelief, imagine for a second that what we are witnessing is real life. But of course, the swarm of cameras, boom mics and reporters that shadow the prime minister’s every move exposes the charade. Morrison is aware of every angle, every interpretation of his campaign event. He curates images and conversations for the consumption of the media pack precisely. He is the star actor, while imagining being the spectator. He is the director of his own show. Despite the best efforts of the cammos, staffers assiduously guide Morrison away from a large statue of a gorilla sitting in a nest of bananas, protecting him from any monkey puns on the evening news. “So this is what you invested with the instant asset write off?” he asks Dom, already knowing the answer, which was included earlier in the campaign brief to reporters. “Well it’s a big fridge. It’s a very big fridge,” Morrison says. “You’d have people just coming here to walk through it in summer – it’s either here or go to the pool!” It’s strange, after two years of pandemic politics, to be reminded of Morrison back in his natural habitat, pressing the flesh with voters, making small talk. Morrison is softer in this embodiment, he smiles and jokes easily. He knows this is his strength as a politician. There are none of the awkward pauses that used to plague Malcolm Turnbull when he attempted to mingle with middle Australia. None of the peculiar Abbott-isms that came before that. No risk of onion-eating here. This is the Morrison machine at its best. Super normal. It’s oddly captivating, the layers of artifice. Will he really cook that okra? I wonder. Pound fresh turmeric for a veggie curry on Saturday night? The bill comes to $52.14. He takes out his credit card and pays. Jumps in a white SUV, and speeds off. This make-believe takes place in the seat of Capricornia, held by the Coalition on a 12.4% margin by Michelle Landry, the incumbent since 2013. The Coalition is feeling comfortable about Queensland. After substantial swings against Labor in 2019, the buffers in the seats north of Brisbane are difficult for Anthony Albanese to overcome at this election. Morrison began the day in Townsville, in the seat of Herbert, held by the nuggety Phil Thompson on an 8.4% margin. When Kevin ‘07 swept John Howard out of office, the seat of Herbert swung 6% towards Labor. Barring any last minute Albomentum, Herbert is not in play. The tour of Doblo’s market is the third campaign stop of the day. “Relentless”, is how one tv journalist who has been captive on the Coalition campaign bus for the past two and a half weeks describes it. “But great pictures”. Most days are the same. A picture opportunity in the morning. A press conference late morning. A change of location and a third stop – usually a manufacturing plant where the hard hats and high vis come out. Guardian Australia jumps on the campaign trail in Townsville, where Morrison has landed after spending Anzac day in Darwin. It is week three of the six-week campaign. The Labor leader Anthony Albanese is in isolation in Sydney with Covid. A ding on the “Scomobile” Whatsapp group advises that the first event on the campaign trail is a visit to the Jean-Pierre wholesale artisan bakery. Morrison rolls croissants, gently sandwiches bright ruby macaron shells together, making small talk with pastry chefs, clapping his hands like a football coach. “That’s how you do it!” At a press conference at the TEi steel fabrication plant, the prime minister stands up to talk about a $60m grant program for business energy efficiency and to announce a hydrogen hub for Townsville. But the prime minister is on the defensive. His first task is to try and tidy up an unwelcome split over the Coalition’s net zero goal after the LNP’s candidate for Flynn, Colin Boyce, suggested there was wriggle room in the commitment. “What he [Boyce] was referring to was our pathway to it and as technologies change and improve, then, of course, we’re going to get there and we’re going to get there by the best method possible.” “It is the government’s absolute policy.” Morrison is also on the back foot over national security, with the government under pressure over whether it has dropped the ball to allow a security pact between China and Solomon Islands to be signed. But Morrison has an answer to everything. On a question on rebuilding trust with Emmanuel Macron, he pivots to the Chinese in the Pacific. Asked question on his remarks that public Icac hearings are a “kangaroo court”, he steers to his rote reply on the integrity commission. The invisible question time folder is always at his fingertips. Morrison has been in cabinet for almost a decade. In 2009, he became opposition spokesperson on immigration – the most challenging portfolio at the time as the country dealt with boat arrivals, and arguably the issue that won them government in 2013. Since that time, he has faced the daily assault of media questioning. He makes no secret of his disdain for most of the press gallery in Canberra, apart from a few friendlies, and feels no need to answer questions he doesn’t like. In the frenzy of campaign press conferences it is even more difficult to pin Morrison down. Only once during this campaign – when the press focus was on the government’s broken promise to establish an integrity commission – has Morrison faced sustained pressure. In The Game, Sean Kelly’s portrait of Scott Morrison, he notes that “one of the truly remarkable facts about Scott Morrison is how few gaffes there have been in his career.” “He makes mistakes, says things that are obviously false, even lies, but rarely does he say something that makes you think that you are suddenly, briefly, getting a glimpse of something you were not meant to see.” Morrison’s campaign has so far been largely mistake-free, even if full of political mistruths and lies. Take the “sneaky carbon tax” which gets a run when Morrison stands up in Rockhampton after having cups of tea with a group of seniors, referring to the safeguard mechanism that the Coalition itself introduced in 2013. Morrison has no compunction. “You have got to scrap to win,” he privately tells colleagues. Despite the national polls pointing to a comfortable Labor win at next month’s election, Morrison displays not a skerrick of self-doubt about the task ahead. He has been in this position before, having told colleagues that he can once again take them on an unlikely path to victory. Bill Shorten at the last election said the Coalition had a “goat track” to win, compared to its freeway. It is even truer this time round, with the government starting behind on 75 seats. It needs 76 for a majority. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I know what the path is and I’ll be following it,” Morrison told MPs in February. “And once again I’m asking you to follow me in going down that path and staying focused on that and only that.” “Do that and we win - it’s that simple.” While the Coalition dares to dream of a second miracle victory under Morrison, the task at this election is far more difficult than in 2019, when the prime minister was being introduced to voters for the first time. This time, Morrison is a known quantity. He has baggage to carry up the track. Across the country, Labor is hammering his record and character, a task made easy by the free character assessments of Morrison offered up by everyone from the then NSW premier to the French president. Labor’s negative campaign has been brought forward, convinced that converting parked votes its way is best achieved by galvanising public anger towards Morrison. But despite the effectiveness of Labor’s message, Coalition strategists insist there is still a path to victory. The logic goes like this: People have already factored in their anger against Morrison, so why haven’t they yet converted their vote to Labor? If they haven’t made up their mind yet, then the parked protest vote is soft. It is in this gap that the Coalition senses opportunity, hammering home the choice between the known and the unknown. “This election is a choice,” Morrison says on repeat. “Between a government that you do know and a Labor opposition that you don’t.” Party strategists also question whether the negative campaign against Morrison has run out of juice. How much lower can Labor’s attack drag the Coalition vote, with it already languishing in the mid 30s? Can community anger be whipped back to where it was at its hottest? Are the baseball bats out for Morrison? In parts of the country, yes. But in the parts that matter? That remains to be seen. “We can win this,” one senior figure says. “It’s not easy, but it’s possible”. The campaign so far has been framed around the Coalition’s traditional core strengths of the economy and national security, but on both of these issues, Morrison has been on the backfoot. In Cairns, at a local shipyard on the banks of Chinaman Creek, Morrison is campaigning with the MP for Leichhardt, former crocodile farmer, Warren Entsch. Morrison is fielding questions on spiking inflation, which has just come in at a 20-year high, undermining the Coalition’s message on strong economic management. But the prime minister seems to relish the opportunity. “Well, look, I’ve been around politics a little while and I’ve also been around the economy a long while,” Morrison starts, before turning to his lines on the risk of a change to Labor. Morrison has two tasks in this campaign. Remind people of his experience. Paint Albanese as a risk. He will do this relentlessly, every day until polling day. This is Entsch’s ninth election. He has contested and won every election in the seat since 1996 - apart from in 2007, when Labor won the seat in his absence. “This is the hardest one to read of all of them,” he tells Guardian Australia. “And that is because of social media, and the hangover from Trump with all the fake news nonsense.” He says he doesn’t sense that baseball bats are out for the government, and insists the reception for Morrison has been positive. But Entsch concedes it will be “tough”. “There is a lot of single issue stuff and a lot of angry people,” Entsch says. There are 11 parties on the Leichhardt ballot paper, and Entsch says they will all drag down his primary vote and likely preference against him. Across the nation, a similar story is heard, with the unprecedented support for independents and other parties the biggest unknown at the coming poll. Compared to previous elections, Entsch says this is the first that he has detected the strong influence of social media on voters. He has had campaign posters defaced with “corruption” graffiti for the first time, had locals yell at him in shopping centres about the “new world order”, and has had countless conversations about fake news. “They think mainstream politicians are corrupt, they think mainstream media is corrupt and they get all their information from the deep, dark abyss of social media. “When I say to them you need to balance out your opinions, look at some reputable news, they come back to me and say ‘social media is my truth’.” Entsch says the election feels a bit like the GST election of 1998, or the Gillard-Abbott contest of 2010 when Australia ended up with a Labor minority government, but hopes as the election draws closer the economic choice will become starker. “You can never know 100%, but I think we are in with a chance.” For Morrison, he is confident that all the ingredients are there for a victory. But will it come together? Or will it remain a figment of imagination, a fantasy left behind on the campaign trail.",News/Australia news,‘The director of his own show’: the PM mingles with middle Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/30/the-director-of-his-own-show-the-pm-mingles-with-middle-australia
4/30/2022,"For tragedy to really tear your heart out, it has to feel preventable. What if Juliet’s messenger had arrived on time? What if Othello had trusted his wife? What if Caesar had just stayed home that day and caught up on the latest papyrus? Watching the brisk, mordant Broadway revival of Macbeth, which stars a muscled, de-Bonded Daniel Craig, you might entertain another what-if: what if medieval Scotland had maximally effective therapy? Sam Gold’s production performed on a seemingly bare stage, designed by Christine Jones and lit, thrillingly – in shocking blues, reds and greens – by Jane Cox. It begins with a precis of attitudes toward early modern witchcraft, delivered, drolly, by Michael Patrick Thornton. An incantation follows. A cast member (Danny Wolohan, later to endure worse) is hung upside down in an inverted cross while other members stir a bubbling pot with suspiciously red contents. Is that smell garlic? Or something more sinister? Still, this swift, savvy Macbeth never winds its charm too tightly; only rarely does it feel unearthly. Instead, Craig’s burly Macbeth, clad handsomely in Suttirat Larlab’s modern dress costumes, is every inch a man of action and a soldier, even in a silky bathrobe, entirely convincing in motion, less persuasive when zipping through Macbeth’s equivocations. If he is in blood stepped in so far, it doesn’t seem to bother him. Any decent castle has maid service. Instead, this Macbeth inhabits a one-man culture of toxic masculinity, prisoner to his vaulting ambition, unable to accept any personal weakness or to enjoy his golden opinions when there is more still to achieve. Infirm of purpose? Please. If this Macbeth could use some time supine on an analyst’s couch, he and Lady Macbeth (a dynamic Ruth Negga) could also use some couples counseling. Negga’s Lady Macbeth is an enabler and an abettor (codependent much?), asking to be unsexed so that she can achieve the masculine ruthlessness that her husband so clearly values. The characters who display more sympathy and fellow feeling – Paul Lazar’s bluff Duncan, Amber Gray’s crystalline Banquo – don’t tend to last long here. The one exception is Grantham Coleman’s upstanding Macduff, who resists the urging of Malcom (Asia Kate Dillon) to man up. “Dispute it like a man,” Malcolm insists. Instead, Macduff insists on making space for his grief and his weakness. “I shall do so,” he says. “But I must also feel it as a man. I cannot but remember such things were, that were most precious to me.” But in contrast to most productions, Macduff’s victory feels less than assured. There’s pleasure to be found here and a dark, macabre wit. The potion that begins the second half has some ghastly ingredients. Poor Wolohan. Gold’s direction is focused and specific, in contrast to his labored King Lear. But there’s something unexamined and underscrutinized in this version. This Macbeth, a man of action, doesn’t change much from the first scene to the last. (His Iago, in Gold’s Othello, had more depth and variety.) Negga’s Lady M transforms, though this happens almost as soon as we meet her. And after the first half, the play mostly shunts her offstage. (Well, to the back of the stage, characters here rarely disappear. Especially dead ones.) There is shock – short, sharp – and surprises and some playful, inventive staging, but little that feels truly risky or dangerous. The conflicts are external, not internal. “It feels good,” Thornton teases in that opening speech, “to cast a little spell”. Yet, despite the charms and potions, there’s not so much magic here.",Arts/Stage,Macbeth review – Daniel Craig and Ruth Negga soar but there’s magic missing,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/29/macbeth-review-daniel-craig-ruth-negga

4/30/2022,"The new chief executive of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, Andrew McConville, has caused consternation after sending an all-staff memo outlining his approach to the job which failed to mention the regulator’s environmental role. A former chief executive of the Australian Petroleum Producers & Exporters Association (APPEA), McConville was appointed to the top job at the MDBA by the Morrison government just days before the federal election was called. He is not due to start until June but recently posted a letter introducing himself to staff and explaining his approach to the job. “I am absolutely thrilled and delighted to have been appointed the chief executive,” he said. “I have a real passion for Australian agriculture and for regional and rural Australia. “This is not an appointment or responsibility I take lightly. The work that you do is important and in the national interest.” The email made no mention of the environmental challenges facing the Murray-Darling Basin, climate change or other stakeholders such as First Nations people, who have been advocating for rights to cultural flows. The omission has worried many MDBA staff – particularly those who work on the environmental side of the organisation. McConville told staff he grew up in Armidale, got an agricultural economics degree at the University of New England and has a master’s of science from Oxford, “where I probably played too much rugby but managed to pass the time”. He said that he spent much of his career in agriculture, focused on building productivity and resilient communities and enterprises “through collaboration with strong relationships, a commitment to sustainability and the sensible use of technology”. McConville said he “had at least a little bit of water in my veins” as he was one of the architects of Victoria’s water trading scheme in the 1990s. He also mentioned his experience at the Australian Wheat Board and at Syngenta – a large agricultural chemicals and seed business – as well as his time at APPEA. “Water management is a complex and contested space with many stakeholders often with competing views,” he said. “Managing stakeholders is something I am passionate about. I have had some tough ones over the years: opponents and proponents of single desk marketing [of wheat] … pesticides and GMOs against organics, and fossil fuels in a net zero world. So how hard can it be, right!?” McConville acknowledged he had a lot to learn and said he wanted staff to share their advice and deep knowledge of the critical river system. A number of staff have raised their concerns about the letter and McConville’s emphasis on agricultural outcomes internally – as well as with Guardian Australia. The MDBA was established under the Water Act 2007 to address historic overallocation of water in the Murray-Darling Basin to agriculture and restore the environmental health of the river. It is now in the final stages of implementing the $13bn plan which is still well short of returning 2,750 gigalitres of water – the amount that states and the commonwealth agreed was the minimum required to ensure a sustainable river system. This figure is seen as inadequate by most environmental scientists. The Act says the MDBA is “to promote the use and management of the basin water resources in a way that optimises economic, social and environmental outcomes” and “to ensure the return to environmentally sustainable levels of extraction for water resources that are over-allocated or overused”. It is also charged with ensuring Australia meets its international obligations to protect several wetlands under the Ramsar treaty arrangements. In undertaking its task it must use the best available science to guide its decision making. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who has taken a deep interest in the Murray-Darling Basin plan, said McConville’s first letter to staff had confirmed fears about the appointment. “Putting an oil and gas lobbyist, from Queensland, in charge of Australia’s most important river system is obscene,” Hanson-Young said. “This email introducing himself to the authority’s staff exposes the worst fears of downstream communities and those who care deeply about the health of the river. “In a rambling, two-page, self-congratulatory memo to staff, not once did Mr McConville even mention the environment. The whole point of the MDBA is to keep the river alive and flowing, yet the new boss displays total ignorance to the needs of the environment and water security impacts of the climate crisis. “The tone-deaf memo is a warning sign of more pain for river. With the Murray-Darling Basin plan failing to deliver the promised and needed environmental flows to South Australia, it is alarming that the guy in charge seems more interested in appeasing corporate irrigators than looking after the environment.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Asked about the memo, McConville said there has been a great deal of interest in his appointment, which was understandable since he had come from outside government and the water, environment and agriculture sectors. “First and foremost my job will always be to run an independent, statutory agency to deliver its remit,” he said. “This also means listening, understanding and working collaboratively with a range of people. In doing that the goal must absolutely be a healthy and sustainable river system because we all benefit from this, it is what all Australians need and expect.” McConville confirmed he knew the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, from university days. Both attended UNE. “We played rugby against each other at opposing colleges some 30 years ago,” McConville said. “Since his entering politics, I have engaged with Barnaby occasionally, as I would and do with a wide range of MPs across the political spectrum. “My relationship is not personal and is no different to any political connection I have on all sides of politics.” In Senate estimates in April, the secretary of the agriculture, water and environment department, Andrew Metcalfe, said McConville was one of three candidates whose names were ultimately sent to the minister for a decision, which was then ratified by cabinet. A total of 19 applications were received and a further five were identified by headhunters. McConville was one of the applicants for the $443,000 a year job. “The panel was very satisfied as to all three candidates,” Metcalfe told estimates. “Mr McConville is certainly someone that we regarded as being a very outstanding candidate.”",News/Australia news,New Murray-Darling Basin Authority boss fails to mention environment in all-staff memo,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/30/new-murray-darling-basin-authority-boss-fails-to-mention-environment-in-all-staff-memo
4/30/2022,"When the Australian election was finally called, I was not in Perth, where I live. Instead, I was sitting in a cafe with a friend in Johannesburg, talking about politics. I was finally home after a hard border closure that saw Western Australia shut itself off from the world for 697 days. I was disappointed not to be there, because during election season Australians throw off their normal aversion to talking about politics. It was one of the first things I noticed about Australia when I moved here. There is a profound reticence on the part of many people to sharing political opinions. In conversation after conversation, Australians are happy to talk about their disdain for politicians, but few are prepared to say what they think about matters they deem to be political – and certainly many people shrink from talking about party political views. Indeed, whether you like him or not, it is this reticence Scott Morrison is speaking to when he references “quiet Australians”. He is alluding to that part of the Australian political identity that values keeping your head down and your politics close to your chest. Those who talk openly about their political views are not “true blue Aussies”. The outspoken are “woke” outsiders, people who go against the grain of the silent majority. In this view of the world, keeping your politics to yourself is a bonus; a sign of authentic Australian-ness. In South Africa of course, the opposite is true. Here, politics is discussed at the drop of a hat. And yes, South Africa’s politicians are among the most corrupt and broken people in the world, but ordinary citizens continue to be deeply engaged in political debate. Politics is stitched into the fabric of everyday life. Every day I have been back in Johannesburg, I have driven past a young man, who begs on a particular corner. Most days, he holds a cup for coins and a sign that reads: “PUTIN MONEY, I PROMISE TO SHARE WITH UKRAINE”. The pun is both hilarious and sad. Thirty years after the end of apartheid, it is a testament to a politically audacious strain in the South African personality; an insistence that everyone has a right to voice their opinion. It speaks also, to South African’s willingness to discuss hard topics without flinching. I had forgotten how much I admire this about the country, and how absent this trait is in quotidian Australian life. It may seem counterintuitive – after all rich countries are supposed to teach poor countries how to behave – but as Australia races towards a generation-defining election, the continent at the edge of the world would do well to consider a few lessons from one of the most vibrant democracies on the planet. South Africans are outspoken about their views, and are committed to robust and often deeply uncomfortable conversations. The result is that people are often far more capable of expressing themselves in political terms than they are in Australia. There is a fearlessness about daily conversations in South Africa that has helped me to think more deeply – and with greater urgency – about politics. For example, a week after arriving, I found myself deep in conversation with a friend who was criticising the leadership of the country’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa. He argued that Ramaphosa is timid and suggested that he has failed to “grasp his historical mandate”. The notion of a “historical mandate” was both delightful and intriguing; precisely the kind of grandiose phrase South Africans bandy about in daily life. I pushed him to explain further and he did. He contended that after a disastrous decade of corruption and mismanagement under Jacob Zuma, Ramaphosa had won the election by carrying the expectations of a weary nation on his shoulders. His task was to rebuild the ANC after nine years of neglect and malfeasance. Instead, my friend argued, the president had squandered the opportunity, in large part because he didn’t understand that he had a mission that was about the times in which he was living, rather than being about any particular ambitions he may have had for himself. It’s an argument that has a lot of merit. Mandela had a historical mission, which was to unite a divided nation. There is now widespread recognition in the country that while Mandela was a special man, he also managed the transition to democracy by navigating the political externalities of the times – the end of communism, the effectiveness of sanctions and the success of domestic pressure on the apartheid regime – and rising to the occasion. The Australian context may be different, but the country faces a similarly significant leadership crisis. The country’s leaders must also rise to the occasion after a wasted decade. Under the Coalition, Australia has been left behind on every defining issue of the millennium – from climate change to race relations to refugee rights and workers’ rights. The increasingly rightwing policies of the Liberal Party have facilitated a politics that is both small-minded and mean-spirited. As a result, Australia finds itself in the unenviable position of having plenty of wealth and no vision. In the coming years, the country faces more bushfires and floods, more drought and extreme weather events, and yet in playgrounds and sports fields around the country, in the next few weeks, people will nod and smile at one another and avoid the kinds of robust conversations that are necessary in momentous times. This will not do: if everyday Aussies can learn anything from South Africa it is that they dare not be silent. They must care more about their futures than they do about maintaining an appearance of political propriety. Scott Morrison is no Mandela, nor is Anthony Albanese, but the stakes of this election are incredibly high. Whoever wins at the polls be entrusted with a historical mandate they dare not betray.",Opinion/Opinion,"Australia, we need to talk about politics: history beckons at this election, and keeping your head down just won’t do",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/30/australia-we-need-to-talk-about-politics-history-beckons-at-this-election-and-keeping-your-head-down-just-wont-do
