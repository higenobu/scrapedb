Masaaki Ito, a managing director at the company - known for its inexpensive bowls of beef on rice - made the remarks at a marketing lecture at Tokyo's Waseda University at the weekend. A company spokesman said he could not confirm Ito's exact words. Ito was not reachable for comment. Yoshinoya, which in recent years has made efforts to expand the appeal of its dishes to women, said it had stripped Ito of all his positions with the company, effective Monday. ""His extremely unacceptable words and deeds could not be tolerated from the point of view of human rights and gender issues,"" Yoshinoya said in a statement. It later said it would dock company president Yasutaka Kawamura's pay by 30% for a three-month period through June.

4/20/2022,"MELBOURNE, Australia — A satellite photo has revealed that China has built a new long-range, early-warning radar that can be used to detect ballistic missiles from thousands of miles away, likely giving it coverage of all of Japan. The image, taken on February 2022 by commercial satellite imagery company Maxar Technologies and published on Google Earth, show that a new Large Phased Array Radar, or LPAR, has been built at an existing mountaintop site in Yiyuan County, Shandong Province, some 70 miles southeast of the provincial capital Jinan. The new array is pointed in a northeasterly direction and was built sometime after November 2019. Its completion can potentially give China early warning of ballistic missile launches from North and South Korea, most of Japan and even parts of Russia’s Far East. The first LPAR at the site, located at 36°01′30″ N, 118°05′31″ E, is some 2,300 feet above sea level. It was finished sometime in 2013-2014 according to Google Earth’s historical imagery and is oriented toward the south-southeast, almost certainly to provide radar coverage of Taiwan. China is also known to operate additional LPAR sites at Lin’an in Zhejiang Province and Heilongjiang Province. These sites enable early warning coverage of Japan, the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan from multiple angles. Another site at Korla in Xinjiang Province provides early warning coverage of India. In addition to providing warning against ballistic missile launches, LPARs can also be used for satellite tracking and general space surveillance. The capabilities of the Chinese LPARs are not known, although the beam of the similar AN/FPS-115 radar found in the U.S. Pave Paws network can be deflected up to 60 degrees from the array’s central boresight axis, allowing each array to cover an azimuth angle of 120 degrees. Previously released photos of China’s LPARs show that the array is also sloped, similar to that of the AN/FPS-115 which is sloped at an angle of 20 degrees, allowing the beam to be directed at any elevation angle between 3 degrees and 85 degrees. The range of the Pave Paws radar network has not been officially published, although Encyclopedia Britannica says that the system “is supposed to detect targets with a radar cross section of 10 square meters at a range of 3,000 nautical miles (5,600 km)”. China has invested considerably in advancing its capabilities for strategic situational awareness as part of its sweeping overall military modernization program. The country’s LPARs are an integral part of China’s early-warning, missile-defense and space-tracking network, which also includes a growing number of space-based sensors and a network of over-the-horizon radars.",World/Defense News,"New Chinese radar looks toward Japan, satellite image shows",https://news.yahoo.com/chinese-radar-looks-towards-japan-191251089.html

4/20/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia said on Monday it had launched mass strikes overnight on the Ukrainian military and associated military targets, using its air force, missile forces, artillery and air defence systems to hit hundreds of targets across its southern neighbour. The Russian defence ministry said in a statement that air-launched missiles had destroyed 16 Ukrainian military facilities overnight, including five command posts, a fuel depot and three ammunition warehouses, as well as Ukrainian armour and forces. It said those strikes took place in the Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions and in the port of Mykolayiv, and that the Russian air force had launched strikes against 108 areas where it said Ukrainian forces and armour were concentrated. The defence ministry accused Ukraine of planning ""monstrous provocations"" with mass civilian casualties designed to cast Russian forces in a bad light. Specifically, it said Ukraine was plotting to shell Orthodox churches and cathedrals in various Ukrainian regions on the night of April 23, the eve of Orthodox Easter which is celebrated by most Ukrainians and Russians. It said it had evidence to back its assertions but did not provide any. There was no immediate response to the allegations from Ukraine. Ukraine's defence ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The Russian defence ministry also spoke of destroying 12 Ukrainian strike drones and tanks in other parts of Ukraine and of using Iskander missiles to destroy four arms and equipment depots in the Luhansk, Vinnytsia and Donetsk regions. Russia, which sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, has pledged to continue what it calls ""a special military operation"" to degrade the Ukrainian military and root out people it calls dangerous nationalists, until it has met all its objectives. It is currently focused on trying to take full control of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, which has been besieged for weeks.

4/20/2022,"It's tempting for Americans to get smug about the sinking of the Moskva, the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea. Whether it was destroyed by Ukrainians or — less plausibly — sunk because of a non-combat onboard explosion of ammunition, the result is both a humiliation and a setback for Vladimir Putin's war efforts. If you're cheering Ukraine's defenders, it's hard not to take some satisfaction in that. But America's fleet might also be more vulnerable than you think. For several years now, going back to a pair of collisions separately involving the U.S.S. John S. McCain and U.S.S. Fitzgerald in 2017, there have been a series of reports indicating that the U.S. Navy is overstretched, overworked, and under-maintained, and thus increasingly vulnerable as it goes about the expensive task of patrolling the world's oceans. A February report by the Government Accountability Office broke down the ugly details of how Navy personnel are struggling to keep their ships running properly. ""Some crewmembers provided examples of parts such as electrical safety equipment being on backorder for up to 2 years and described difficulties locating consumable materials such as filters, specific types of oil, and protective clothing for themselves,"" the GAO reported. ""Ten of the 16 ships' crews we met with stated that they resorted to cannibalizing parts — that is, taking functional parts away from other ships, in turn leaving them less-than-operational — so their respective ships could remain operational."" America might have what is regarded as the most powerful navy in the world — China has the largest, but many of its ships are smaller — but it is clearly fragile. And that's a problem. ""The U.S. Navy is on the verge of strategic bankruptcy,"" Christopher Dougherty, a former assistant defense secretary, wrote last year. ""Its fleet isn't large enough to meet global day-to-day demands for naval forces. Due to repeated deployments and maintenance backlogs, the fleet also isn't ready enough to meet these demands safely, nor can it quickly surge in an emergency."" He concluded that ""the risk of its debts coming due suddenly (and perhaps violently) will increase."" Even without those challenges, there is also the question of whether the U.S. Navy is built for the modern world. Just as aircraft carriers once replaced battleships as the backbone of the fleet, there are now questions about whether America's carrier-based fleet is overly vulnerable to a new generation of Chinese anti-ship ballistic missiles. And those questions are likely to get more pertinent if it turns out the Ukrainians really did take out the Moskva with their new Neptune missile. America has spent much of the 21st century learning that the overwhelming power of its armed forces isn't always so overwhelming. The sinking of the Moskva is a sign that such a lesson might also extend to the U.S. Navy. Finding out the hard way might be disastrous. The sinking of Russia's flagship might be a bad sign for the U.S. Navy Russia's sunken flagship Moskva is literally irreplaceable, its loss shrouded in questions 84 percent of GOP voters say the world would be better off if Biden weren't in office. 83 percent say the same of Putin.",World/The Week,The sinking of Russia's flagship might be a bad sign for the U.S. Navy,https://news.yahoo.com/sinking-russias-flagship-might-bad-163928574.html

4/20/2022,"BEIRUT (AP) — During a visit to Syria in 2017, Vladimir Putin lavished praise on a Syrian general whose division played an instrumental role in defeating insurgents in the country’s long-running civil war. The Russian president told him his cooperation with Russian troops “will lead to great successes in the future.” Now members of Brig. Gen. Suheil al-Hassan’s division are among hundreds of Russian-trained Syrian fighters who have reportedly signed up to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, including Syrian soldiers, former rebels and experienced fighters who fought for years against the Islamic State group in Syria’s desert. So far, only a small number appears to have arrived in Russia for military training ahead of deployment on the front lines. Although Kremlin officials boasted early in the war of more than 16,000 applications from the Middle East, U.S. officials and activists monitoring Syria say there have not yet been significant numbers of fighters from the region joining the war in Ukraine. Analysts, however, say this could change as Russia prepares for the next phase of the battle with a full-scale offensive in eastern Ukraine. They believe fighters from Syria are more likely to be deployed in coming weeks, especially after Putin named Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, who commanded the Russian military in Syria, as the new war commander in Ukraine. Though some question how effective Syrian fighters would be in Ukraine, they could be brought in if more forces are needed to besiege cities or to make up for rising casualties. Dvornikov is well acquainted with the multiple paramilitary forces in Syria trained by Russia while he oversaw the strategy of ruthlessly besieging and bombarding opposition-held cities in Syria into submission. “Russia is preparing for a greater battle” in Ukraine and Syrian fighters are likely to take part, said Ahmad Hamada, a Syrian army defector who is now a military analyst based in Turkey. Syria observers and activists say the Russians have been actively recruiting in Syria for the Ukraine war, particularly among Russian-trained combatants. Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, reported that so far about 40,000 people have registered -- 22,000 with the Russian military and about 18,000 with the Russian private contractor Wagner Group. Around 700 members of al-Hassan’s 25th Special Missions Forces Division, known in Syria as the “Tiger Force,” left Syria over the past weeks to fight along Russian forces, Abdurrahman said. The numbers could not be independently confirmed. Pro-government activists posted videos over the past two weeks on social media showing members of the Tiger Force performing military drills including parachuting from helicopters. Russian officers appeared in one of the videos advising the paratroopers inside a helicopter as al-Hassan praised the young men by tapping on their heads. It was not immediately clear if the videos were new. Abdurrahman said there are also volunteers from the Russian-trained 5th Division; the Baath brigades, which is the armed wing of Assad’s ruling Baath party; and the Palestinian Quds Brigade, made up of Palestinian refugees in Syria. All have fought alongside the Russian military in Syria’s war. “The Russians are looking for experienced fighters. They don’t want anyone who was not trained by the Russians,” Abdurrahman said. The Tiger Force took credit for some of the biggest government victories in the 11-year conflict. It was involved in a monthslong Russian-backed campaign into the rebels’ last enclave, located in the northwest province of Idlib, which ended in March 2020 with government forces capturing a vital north-south highway -- though rebels remain in control of the enclave. Al-Hassan “is one of Russia’s men and Russia will depend on him,” said Omar Abu Layla, a Europe-based activist who runs the DeirEzzor 24, a Syria war monitoring group. Hundreds of fighters from the 5th Division and the Quds Brigade have registered at Russia's Hmeimeem base in western Syria, which is leading recruitment efforts, and are waiting for orders, he said. In late March, a Russian-trained force known as the “ISIS Hunters” militia, which fought for years against IS, posted an ad calling on men aged 23 to 49 to come forward for screening, saying those who pass the test and are found suitable will be called on later. So far, about 100 men have registered their names in the southern province of Sweida, according to Rayan Maarouf of Suwayda24, an activist collective that covers IS activities in the Syrian desert. He added that they were promised a monthly income of no less than $600, a huge sum of money amid widespread unemployment and the crash of the Syrian pound. Earlier this month, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. had indications that the Wagner Group is trying to recruit fighters, mostly from the Middle East, to deploy in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. But he said there has been “no specific information” on numbers recruited. “We just aren’t there yet to see anything real demonstrable when it comes to reinforcement,” he added. Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in early March that so far there are only “very small groups” trying to make their way from Syria to Ukraine, calling it a “very small trickle.” Retired Lebanese army general Naji Malaeb, who follows the war in Syria closely, said there is no indication so far of Syrian fighters traveling to Russia, but this could change as the war drags on. “This all depends on what the Russians plan to do in the near future,” Malaeb said. Syrian and Palestinian officials in Syria have played down reports of fighters heading to Ukraine. The Syrian government is likely wary of having Syrian fighters flock to Ukraine, opening opportunities at the front lines that its many opponents could exploit. In a potentially worrying sign for the Syrian government, Russia has significantly scaled down its operations in Syria since the war in Ukraine started, with fewer airstrikes targeting IS or opposition positions in Idlib. “Any change in the posture of Russian forces or pro-regime militias creates security gaps that anti-regime actors including Turkey, ISIS, al-Qaida and Syrian opposition groups can exploit,” the ISW report said. Muhannad Haj Ali, a former legislator and a commander with the armed wing of Syria’s ruling Baath party said no Syrians have gone to fight in Ukraine and that he didn’t expect any to go. He said he was certain Russia will win in Ukraine without any need for Syrians’ help. “The way the operations are going is clear indication that Ukraine will not be another Afghanistan,” he said.",World/Associated Press,Syrian fighters ready to join next phase of Ukraine war,https://news.yahoo.com/syrian-fighters-ready-join-next-055955874.html

4/20/2022,"Experts are warning China’s recent string of COVID-19 lockdowns is about to send another shock through global supply chains. At least 373 million people—in cities that represent roughly 40% of China’s gross domestic product—have been affected by the most recent wave of lockdowns across China, Reuters reported last week. The strict lockdowns have left some residents desperate for food and led to viral videos of Shanghai residents screaming from the windows of their high-rise apartments. And with Chinese President Xi Jinping doubling down on the country’s zero-COVID approach, what happens in China isn’t likely to stay there. Global supply chains are set to take a hit. After all, Shanghai is home to the world’s largest port, and although it has largely remained open, trucks are struggling to unload cargo due to strict permit regulations, causing shipping containers to stack up. “Even with air and ocean ports open, the length of the shutdown could make this iteration the most significant logistics disruption since the start of the pandemic,” the shipping company Freightos said in an update to clients this week. That’s rough news for the American consumer, given the fact that the U.S. imported more goods from China than anywhere else in the world over the past decade. In 2020 alone, the U.S imported roughly $435 billion worth of goods from Chinese cities and sent another $125 billion to the country in exports, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. That means, once lockdowns end, there’s going to be an “overwhelming movement of goods” that cripples supply chains, Jon Monroe, an ocean shipping and supply-chain expert who runs Jon Monroe Consulting, told FreightWaves on Friday. “It’s probably worse than Wuhan. You’re going to have a lot of pent-up orders,” he said. Lars Jensen, the CEO of the shipping industry adviser Vespucci Maritime, said that he doesn’t see any immediate end in sight to production and logistics disruptions in China either. “The supply-chain situation in Shanghai continues to worsen. The port is running out of capacity for some types of cargo as importers cannot collect their goods,” Jensen wrote in a Friday post. “With the outbreak in Guangzhou also leading to shutdowns there, the impact on export volumes out of China will grow larger.” Investment banks are also sounding the alarm on the potential impact of the strict lockdowns in China. In a note downgrading Chinese GDP growth expectations, UBS said even more localities have initiated “de facto lockdowns” since finding COVID-19 cases. “Logistic problems were more widespread in April, leading to production disruptions in multiple industries,” the UBS team led by economist Tao Wang wrote. “This could impact China’s trade more significantly in April.” The economists added that they believe the Chinese government is unlikely to adjust its current policy anytime soon, even if officials are working to reduce transport blockages and production disruptions, meaning supply-chain chaos is likely to continue in the near term. The effects of the widespread lockdowns in China are already being felt as far as Europe, according to the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. The organization sent a letter to the Chinese government urging officials to revise their policies last week, arguing the effects of the lockdowns have already begun to affect European suppliers. A flash survey from the German Chamber of Commerce in China conducted in the first week of April found that roughly half of German companies' logistics, warehousing, and supply-chain operations were ""completely disrupted or severely impacted by the current COVID-19 situation in China,"" Reuters reported.

4/20/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration plans to rescind a rule devised under his predecessor Donald Trump that was intended to make it easier for healthcare providers including doctors and nurses to avoid performing abortions or other medical services on religious or moral grounds, Politico reported on Tuesday. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 2018 unveiled what it called the ""conscience rule,"" but it never took effect due to litigation. States including California and New York and abortion providers filed suit to challenge it, leading a federal court to block the measure in 2019. The rule enabled the federal government to punish hospitals, clinics, universities and other healthcare providers that stopped healthcare workers from doing what their ""conscience"" dictated and refusing to carry out certain procedures. Trump's HHS said the rule fulfilled his ""promise to promote and protect the fundamental and unalienable rights of conscience and religious liberty."" Religious conservatives were a key constituency for Trump. Politico, quoting sources familiar with the matter, reported that HHS could act to rescind the rule as soon as the end of this month. HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some states and municipalities argued that the rule could undermine their ability to provide effective healthcare and upend their efforts to accommodate workers' beliefs. Critics also have said the rule could deprive gay, transgender and other patients of needed healthcare because some providers, citing religious beliefs, might deem them less worthy of treatment. Biden, a Democrat, promised during his 2020 election campaign to reverse many of the measures restricting reproductive rights introduced or backed by Trump, a Republican. Republican-governed states have passed a series of laws in recent years restricting abortion rights. The U.S. Supreme Court is due to rule by the end of June in a case from Mississippi that gives its conservative majority a chance to overturn its landmark 1973 ruling legalizing abortion nationwide.

4/20/2022,"Thirty years ago, at 14, I was a child who made a huge mistake. I married my first boyfriend because I was pregnant with his child. I found myself trapped in an abusive relationship with a man who abused pain medication every day, refused to work and only wanted to live off government assistance. I didn’t believe in any of that and vowed to work myself out of that life. Against all odds, I went to college, got my degree and became a public-school teacher in Florida. I loved working with children in school and spending time with my own children. During this time, my husband became more abusive. Ten years ago, I got the courage to leave the marriage with the hope of building a happy life for myself and my children. However, during the divorce, I learned a word I had never known — alimony. It never occurred to me that if I left this horrible situation, I would have to continue to work to pay a significant amount of my hard-earned income to a man who refused to work, abused his family and still refuses to even look for work. How could this happen? Actually, Florida law allows it to happen, and divorce lawyers drain families of all their savings and assets to get as much alimony as possible for their clients, in this case my ex-husband. The inconsistency of outcomes in court encourages costly, lengthy litigation. And, who really wins? Divorce lawyers. I was forced to pay permanent lifetime alimony to a man who never cared for his children, who lives far away and who has never even tried to sustain himself. I have been paying him for the past 10 years, while I continue to work and better myself. How can the courts say that I have to do this forever, until I die. How is this fair? I implore Gov. Ron DeSantis to sign the alimony reform legislation — Senate Bill 1796 — into law. The bill proposes reasonable guidelines and makes it harder for divorce lawyers to use children as bargaining chips during divorce proceedings when mothers and fathers are already going through a challenging time. The bill also creates parameters for the already existing “right to retire” for alimony payers like me, which are rarely enforced by the courts. Even trying to modify modifiable alimony agreements is cost-prohibitive thanks to antiquated laws and divorce attorneys’ fees. The governor can help Florida’s families by signing SB 1796 into law, bringing equity, predictability and an opportunity for alimony payers like me to retire with dignity.

4/20/2022,"By Philip Pullella ROME (Reuters) -A Ukrainian mayor described hours of ""hard"" interrogations when held for almost a week by Russian forces last month and said he had appealed to the pope for help to stop a war that had wrecked swathes of his city in southern Ukraine. ""It was a dangerous six days because I understood that for Russians my life and the lives of civilians were worth zero,"" Ivan Fedorov, mayor of Melitopol which is now under Russian control, said in Rome on Sunday, a month after his release. Ukraine said Fedorov was abducted on March 11 after Russian forces seized Melitopol, which lies west of the besieged city of Mariupol in a southern region that Russia seeks to control. Kyiv announced Fedorov's release in a prisoner exchange on March 16. Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"", has made no comment about the mayor's detention or the prisoner swap reported by Ukraine. Fedorov, who met Pope Francis and Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin on Saturday before attending an Easter eve service, said he had asked the Vatican to intercede with Russian President Vladimir Putin to guarantee humanitarian corridors for Mariupol, which has faced devastating bombardment. Major Serhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine's 36th marine brigade which is still fighting in Mariupol, also appealed to the pope for help in a letter posted on Telegram on Monday. ""I don't have much time to describe all the horrors that I see here every day. Women with children and babies live in bunkers ... Every day the wounded die because there are no medications. No water, no food,"" he wrote. ""Help save them."" Describing his detention by Russian forces in Melitopol's police department, Fedorov said in an interview: ""They came to me at night with five or seven soldiers and spoke for about four or five hours, hard dialogue."" 'HALF MY CITY IS WRECKED' ""They wanted to make an example of me about what would happen if we did not agree to what the Russians wanted,"" the mayor told Reuters and the Italian newspaper Il Messaggero, saying he had faced ""psychological"" but not physical torture. ""Russian soldiers assumed that they would be welcomed but they were not ... and that is why the Russians were very, very angry,"" he said. ""There is no food in my city. There is no pharmacy. Half of my city is wrecked. More than 200 people have been kidnapped. It is not safe to walk the streets,"" he said. Russia denies targeting civilians and rejects what Ukraine says is evidence of atrocities, saying Kyiv has staged them to undermine peace talks. Moscow says it launched its military action almost two months ago to demilitarise Ukraine and eradicate what it calls dangerous nationalists. Seizing Melitopol, Mariupol and the southern coast would give Russian forces a land link between pro-Russian separatists in east Ukraine and the Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014. Russia has said it almost has full control of Mariupol. Fedorov, who said he remained in regular contact with the people of Melitopol, said he had invited the pope to visit Ukraine because ""maybe he can stop this war"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has also invited the pope, promising to guarantee his security. Pope Francis has implicitly criticised Russia, calling for an end to a war that involved unjustified aggression and invasion. Addressing Fedorov and other Ukrainians in the Easter eve service, the pope said: ""Have courage, we accompany you"".

4/20/2022,"Moscow's mayor says that 200,000 Russians in the city are likely to be without work. Hundreds of Western companies have distanced themselves from Russia, creating a dearth in jobs. Some global firms pledged to continue paying their local workers, though it's unclear for how long. Moscow's mayor said on Monday that hundreds of thousands of city residents could lose their jobs as Western companies suspend or pull their operations from Russia. ""According to our estimates, about 200,000 people are at risk of losing their jobs,"" Mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote in an official blog post. In the post, Sobyanin said Moscow had approved an employment support program worth 3.36 billion rubles, or roughly $41 million, that would supply temporary jobs or training to those without work. Sobyanin wrote that around 58,000 employees are expected to benefit from the program and highlighted that Russia would provide a monthly allowance for children and loans for small and medium businesses. Sobyanin's comments come as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to deny Western sanctions have impacted Russia's economy. ""We can now confidently say that such policy (of sanctions) towards Russia has failed,"" he said on Monday. ""The economic blitzkrieg strategy didn't work. Moreover, the initiators themselves couldn't get away with the sanctions."" More than 750 companies have publicly announced that they would cut operations in Russia to some degree since the invasion of Ukraine began, according to the Yale School of Management. Some companies have pledged to continue paying their Russian workers even while shuttered in the country, though it's unclear exactly how long they plan to sustain their support. McDonald's, one of the first major businesses to withdraw from Russia, said that its store closures in the country cost the company $50 million a month as it keeps its roughly 62,000 local workers on payroll. Some of its locations are still open because the franchisees who own and operate those restaurants have refused to close, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Sobyanin's post indicated that Moscow is still grappling with a long list of crises. City authorities will discuss in the next two weeks how the capital will maintain its stock of medicines without imports, and how it will keep its hospitality industry afloat, he wrote. ""There is a lot of work to be done, the results of which will appear only in a few years,"" wrote Sobyanin.

4/20/2022,"CHISINAU (Reuters) - Moldova's president called on Tuesday for people and opposition politicians to refrain from using Russian symbols during May 9 celebrations to mark victory in World War Two because Russian troops were killing civilians in Ukraine. ""It is impossible to combine in the same symbol the memory of lives given for peace and the current inhumane war,"" President Maia Sandu told a briefing. In 2020, the pro-Western Sandu won election against her pro-Russian predecessor Igor Dodon, but his allies still hold influence in the former Soviet republic. Dodon has urged people to ""go on the Victory March with a St. George ribbons"" despite possible fines, referring to the black and orange striped ribbon which has become a military symbol of Russian patriotism. Last week, Moldova's parliament voted to outlaw the ribbon of St. George in response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine. Under the new law, anyone who makes, wears or displays the striped ribbon faces a fine of at least 900 lei ($49) or 69 hours of community service. Sandu urged her political opponents – communist and socialist parties - not to divide society for the sake of their political interests. ""Moldova...defends its neutrality - and peace in society. That is why the symbols of the war waged against Ukraine are prohibited in the Republic of Moldova. I urge politicians to refrain from any provocation,"" Sandu said. Russia has repeatedly denied its troops have targeted civilians since invading Ukraine on Feb. 24 to carry out what it calls a ""special military operation"". The West and Russia vie for influence Moldova, a country of 3.5 million people, which depends on Russian energy and part of which has been controlled by Russia-backed separatists for more than three decades. Last month Sandu signed a formal application for Moldova to join the European Union, hastening its planned pro-Western course after the invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. Lithuania's parliament on Tuesday also voted to ban public displays of St. George ribbon, the letter ""Z"", and other symbols seen as expressing support for the Russian invasion. The ribbon of St George, first introduced as an honour by Catherine the Great, has gained significance in the Russian-speaking world since separatists in eastern Ukraine adopted it as a symbol of their support for Russia in 2014. Russian military vehicles in Ukraine are prominently marked with the letter ""Z"", and it has started appearing on social media and on clothing elsewhere in support of the war.

4/20/2022,"Amazon workers arriving at one company warehouse on Easter Sunday were greeted with a cheerful message from management. As a holiday incentive, there would be a contest, and a raffle. Those who picked products above a certain speed would be entered into a draw to win a goodie bag. ""Thank you all for coming in on Easter Sunday!"" the note said. “Good Luck everyone and THANK YOU!!!” The grand prize? Water or soda plus a candy bar or bag of chips. Worth roughly $2. An amount that, when compared to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ hourly haul, generated a wave of ridicule from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and many others across social media. Bezos, the second richest man on earth after Elon Musk, has a net worth of $177 billion as calculated by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Amazon founder earns $8,961,187 a day—roughly 315 times Amazon's $28,466 median annual worker pay—according to a recent report by Business Insider. And each minute he earns $152,000, more than three times what the median U.S. worker makes in a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1516106787451117568 The raffle garnered a strong Internet response and heightened anger towards Amazon's anti-union behavior. Sen. Bernie Sanders called out Amazon’s “corporate greed” and mentioned Bezos’s $500 million yacht and $175 million Beverly Hills estate. He left out Bezos's $16 million apartment on New York's Fifth Avenue, however, as well as his four condos overlooking Central Park in the same city, his 10 bedroom house in Washington D.C., and the 30,000-acre ranch he owns in Texas. https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1516223640274096128 Dan Price, the founder of credit card processing company Gravity Payments who famously raised the minimum salary for employees at his company to $70,000 and lowered his own wage from $1.1 million to the same amount, also called out Amazon's work practices. https://twitter.com/DanPriceSeattle/status/1516112444514762752 For his part, author and journalist Brian Merchant sarcastically challenged Amazon’s fierce attempts to shut down any unionization at the company. https://twitter.com/bcmerchant/status/1516173456865255424 Amazon workers at a New York warehouse voted on Apr. 1 to join the independent Amazon Labor Union (ALU), a major milestone that could force the retail tech giant to become more accountable for workplace injuries and other employee complaints. Calls for unionization have been growing across the U.S., where Amazon is the second largest employer. Amazon has poured resources into fighting unionization efforts, however, regarding unions as an obstacle to business flexibility and warehouse efficiency. After the New York warehouse unionization vote, Amazon said it was disappointed in the outcome. “We believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees,” wrote Amazon in a statement about the results, adding, “we’re evaluating our options, including filing objections based on the inappropriate and undue influence by the NLRB that we and others (including the National Retail Federation and U.S. Chamber of Commerce) witnessed in this election.” On May 2, a second Amazon facility in New York — the LBJ5 sortation center on Staten Island — will hold a union election over joining the ALU.

4/20/2022,"Rattlesnake catchers don’t like surprises, but that’s what happened to Marissa Maki when she started poking around a cactus. Venomous snakes had been seen in an Arizona family’s yard, and video shows Maki found them in a most unexpected way. She stuck a pair of tongs deep into a pink cactus and pulled the tool out seconds later with two very excited snakes writhing from the grip. They were western diamondback rattlesnakes, each one nearly 3 feet long. Maki was surprised, but she kept her head, the video shows. “I thought I had just one and then I somehow got both the snakes. It was pretty awesome,” Maki told McClatchy News. “I’ve never done that before and I was excited. I wish I could say I planned that, but it was pure accident.” Video of her “double grab” has been viewed more than 7,200 times since being posted by Maki’s employer, Rattlesnake Solutions, an Arizona-based snake relocation service. Some have called it more “crazy” than cool, given Maki was dodging two sets of fangs at once. It happened March 23 in the Gold Canyon area southeast of Phoenix. The homeowners had reported seeing rattlesnakes in the front yard, calling Rattlesnake Solutions out of fear the reptiles would eventually encounter their recently acquired puppy. Western diamondback rattlesnakes live to 20 years and average 3 to 5 feet in Arizona, though some have been known to reach 7 feet, according to the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. The two snakes Maki caught were happily coiled up at the base of the cactus and clearly annoyed (lots of rattlings) when Maki interrupted their quality time. They were placed in a bucket together and eventually relocated to a large pack rat nest in the desert, which is standard procedure for Rattlesnake Solutions.

4/20/2022,"KVIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian military official said street battles have begun and evacuation is impossible in the town of Kreminna. That's one of only two spots where the Ukrainians said the Russians managed to break through on Monday along a front stretching for hundreds of miles. Luhansk regional military administrator Serhiy Haidai said the town came under heavy artillery overnight, setting seven residential buildings on fire, and that the Olympus sports complex where the nation's Olympic team trains was targeted. Haidai later said on Ukrainian TV that Russians took control of the city after “leveling everything to the ground,” so his guys retreated to regroup and keep on fighting. “It simply makes no sense to stand in one place, to die for everyone, without causing significant damage to the enemy,” he said. ___ KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: — 'No surrender’: Ukrainians fight on in Mariupol steel plant — Russia renews strikes on Ukraine capital, hits other cities — Syrian fighters ready to join next phase of Ukraine war — Bosnians warn Ukrainians: It’s a long journey to justice — Mother, grandmother weep over 15-year-old killed in Kharkiv Follow all AP stories on Russia's war on Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine. ___ OTHER DEVELOPMENTS: KVIV, Ukraine — Russian forces are attacking along a broad front, over 300 miles (480 kilometers) long, Ukrainian officials said Monday. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces were increasing assaults in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions — both of which are part of the Donbas — as well as in the area of Zaporizhzhia, they said. “The occupiers attempted to break through our defenses,” said Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council. “Fortunately, our military is holding out. They passed through only two cities — this is Kreminna and another small town.” He added: “We are not giving up any of our territories.” Russia also bombarded the relative safe haven of Lviv and a multitude of other targets across Ukraine in what appeared to be an intensified bid to grind down the country’s defenses. Moscow said its missiles struck more than 20 military targets, including ammunition depots, command headquarters and groups of troops and vehicles, while its artillery hit an additional 315 targets and its warplanes conducted 108 strikes. The claims could not be independently verified. ___ KVIV, Ukraine — Russia has begun dropping bunker-buster bombs on a Mariupol steel plant where Ukrainians are refusing to surrender, the commander of the Azov Regiment of the National Guard said Monday. Denys Prokopenko, whose soldiers have been holding out against Russian forces in the key southern port city, said in a video message that the bombs are dropping even though civilians are sheltering in the plant’s tunnels. “Russian occupational forces, and their proxy ... know about the civilians, and they keep willingly firing on the factory,” he said. Russia estimated that 2,500 Ukrainian troops and about 400 foreign mercenaries were dug in. The U.S. said nearly a dozen Russian battalion tactical groups have been tied up trying to defeat them. The head of the city’s patrol police, Mikhail Vershinin, told Mariupol television on Sunday that many civilians including children are hiding in the plant, seeking shelter from Russian shelling and forces occupying other parts of the city. Ukraine estimates that 21,000 people have been killed in Mariupol. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned Russia on social media that refusing to open humanitarian corridors will justify war crimes trials. The Russians, for their part, said “neo-Nazi nationalists” have hampered evacuations. ___ KVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia has launched its long-feared, full-scale offensive to take control of Ukraine’s east, “Now we can already state that the Russian troops have begun the battle for the Donbas,” he said in a video address. Zelenskyy said a “significant part of the entire Russian army is now concentrated on this offensive.” The Donbas is Ukraine’s mostly Russian-speaking industrial heartland in the east, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for the past eight years and have declared two independent republics recognized by Russia. The Kremlin declared the capture of the Donbas its main goal of the war after failing to storm. After withdrawing from the capital, it began regrouping and reinforcing its ground troops in the east for what could be a climactic battle. “No matter how many Russian troops are driven there, we will fight,” Zelenskyy vowed. “We will defend ourselves. We will do it every day.” ___ UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations’ humanitarian chief said it seems “the time is not quite ripe yet” to establish a cease fire to get humanitarian aid into Ukraine, but he held out hope as the Orthodox Easter holiday approaches this weekend. “Maybe there will be some ripeness,” Under-Secretary-General Martin Griffiths said at a news conference on Monday. After traveling to Kviv and Moscow for high-level meetings with Ukrainian and Russian officials this month, Griffiths told The Associated Press he had sensed little trust between the adversaries and was “not optimistic.” Griffiths called for Russia and Ukraine to return to talks aimed at ending the war and for “much, much more willing acceptance, primarily of the Russian federation, to allow convoys in and convoys out.” “For now, let’s get aid to people where they need it,” Griffiths said. The U.N. says 12 million people have been uprooted by the war, with about 5 million of them pouring across borders and the rest seeking safety elsewhere in Ukraine. ___ BERLIN — Germany’s employers and unions have joined together in opposing an immediate European Union ban on natural gas imports from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. They say a boycott would lead to factory shutdowns and job losses in the bloc’s largest economy. “A rapid gas embargo would lead to loss of production, shutdowns, a further de-industrialization and the long-term loss of work positions in Germany,” said Rainer Dulger, chairman of the BDA employer’s group, and Reiner Hoffmann, chairman of the DGB trade union confederation. Their joint statement Monday to Germany’s dpa news agency comes as European leaders discuss possible new energy sanctions against Russian oil, following a decision April 7 to ban Russian coal imports beginning in August. Ukraine’s leaders say revenues from Russia’s energy exports are financing Moscow’s destructive war on Ukraine and must be ended. That won’t be easy to do. The EU’s 27 nations get around 40% of their natural gas from Russia and around 25% of their oil. ___ Ukraine rejected as baseless and false the accusations made by Serbia’s president that Ukraine’s secret service is behind a series of hoax bomb threats against Air Serbia flights to Russia. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has claimed that the foreign intelligence services of Ukraine and an unidentified European Union nation are responsible. The pro-Russian Serbian leader did not provide evidence for his claim. Other Serbian officials alleged that the threats were being sent from Ukraine or Poland. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nilolenko on Monday called the allegations false. The Serbian national carrier is the only European airline besides Turkish air companies that has not joined EU flight sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine. ___ BRUSSELS — The European Union’s top diplomat condemned Russia’s “indiscriminate and illegal” attacks on Ukraine on Monday as the country experienced the most intense missile strikes in weeks. Josep Borrell, the high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said in a statement that the EU supports the work of the International Criminal Court and other efforts to ensure accountability for human rights violations. “There can be no impunity for war crimes,” said Borrell, who called for Russia to immediately cease hostilities and withdraw forces from Ukraine. ___ WASHINGTON — The Pentagon says Russia has added artillery, ground combat forces and other capabilities in recent days ahead of a new ground offensive in the Donbas region in Ukraine. A senior U.S. defense official said the number of combat units known as battalion tactical groups in eastern and southern Ukraine has grown to 76 from 65 last week. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military assessments of the war. It’s difficult to know at this stage of the war, but that could add up to 50,000 to 60,000 Russian troops, depending on how developed the groups are. The official said that if Russian forces succeed in fully controlling the southern port of Mariupol it could free up nearly a dozen battalion tactical groups for use elsewhere in the Donbas region. The official also said that four U.S. cargo flights arrived in Europe on Sunday with weapons and other materials, part of $800 million in assistance announced last week. The official said training of Ukrainian personnel on U.S. Army and Marine Corps 155mm howitzers is set to begin at an undisclosed location outside of Ukraine in the next several days. The U.S. pledged 18 howitzers to bolster Ukrainian forces in the Donbas fight, and these trainees can in turn train more soldiers inside Ukraine. — AP Military Writer Robert Burns in Washington contributed to this report. ___ KVIV, Ukraine — President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has formally submitted Ukraine’s answers to a questionnaire from the European Union, the first step in his campaign to obtain accelerated EU membership. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said when presenting the questions to Zelenskyy in early April that a preliminary decision on Ukraine’s candidacy could come in weeks. Ukraine’s drive to join the bloc has been a provocative issue with Russia for years. “The people of Ukraine are united by this goal -- to feel they are an equal part of Europe,” Zelenskyy said Monday as he handed two thick binders of Ukrainian responses to Matti Maasikas, the EU’s envoy for Ukraine. ___ SARAJEVO, Bosnia — Survivors of war crimes committed during Bosnia’s war 30 years ago say the victims of human rights abuses in Ukraine can learn from their experience, which was lengthy and painful. It took decades to arrest and try the wartime Bosnian Serb leaders, and more than 7,000 people still remain unaccounted-for. But the U.N. war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia eventually convicted 83 high-ranking political and military officials and transferred a mountain of evidence against lower-ranking suspects to their home countries for prosecution. The guilty were collectively sentenced to over 700 years in prison. Munira Subasic helped create Mothers of Srebrenica to demand that bodies be identified and those responsible brought to justice. To date, almost 90 percent of those reported missing from the fall of Srebrenica have been accounted for. “Russia’s denials of massacres its soldiers are now obviously committing in Ukraine sound to me the same as Srebrenica genocide denial,” Subasic said. “But if survivors are persistent, the truth will prevail.” ___ BEIRUT — Kremlin officials boasted early in their war on Ukraine that  thousands of experienced fighters from the Middle East would join Russian forces. Military analysts say only a small number appears to have arrived in Russia for training before being deployed to the front lines, but they say that could change as Russia prepares for a full-scale offensive. U.S. officials and activists monitoring Syria say the Russians have been actively recruiting. Rami Abdurrahman leads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. He reported that about 40,000 people have registered so far with the Russian military and with Wagner Group, which is a Russian private contractor. Rayan Maarouf of Suwayda24, an activist collective that covers IS activities in the Syrian desert, said fighters were promised no less than $600 a month. That’s a huge sum of money amid widespread unemployment in Syria. Analysts say fighters from Syria are more likely to be deployed in coming weeks, especially after Gen. Alexander Dvornikov was named war commander. Dvornikov is well acquainted with the paramilitary forces Russia trained in Syria. Though some question how effective Syrian fighters would be in Ukraine, they could be brought in if more forces are needed to besiege cities or to make up for rising casualties. ___ MOSCOW — Russia’s President Vladimir Putin says that the barrage of Western sanctions against Russia has failed. Putin said Monday that the West “expected to quickly upset the financial-economic situation, provoke panic in the markets, the collapse of the banking system and shortages in stores.” He added that “the strategy of the economic blitz has failed.” The Russian leader spoke in televised remarks during a video call with top economic officials. Putin noted that “Russia has withstood the unprecedented pressure,” arguing that the ruble has strengthened and the country has recorded a historic high trade surplus of $58 billion in the first quarter of the year. Instead, he contended that the sanctions backfired against the U.S. and its European allies, speeding up inflation and leading to a drop in living standards. Putin acknowledged a sharp hike in consumer prices in Russia, saying they rose by 17.5% as of April on a year-to-year basis and directing the government to index wages and other payments to alleviate the impact of inflation on people’s incomes. ___ KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said Russia can be prosecuted for war crimes over its refusal to allow humanitarian corridors for civilians trapped in the city of Mariupol. Earlier on Monday, Iryna Vereshchuk had said no evacuations were possible for the second day in a row because of Russian attacks on civilian convoys. “Your refusal to open these humanitarian corridors will in the future be a reason to prosecute all involved for war crimes,” she wrote on her Telegram and Facebook channels. Vereshchuk called again on Russia to allow safe evacuation of civilians from Mariupol, especially the Azovstal steel mill, which covers more than 11 square kilometers (4 square miles) and is laced with tunnels. According to Vereshchuk, the government had been negotiating passage from Mariupol and Berdyansk, among other towns, as well as from the Luhansk region. The Luhansk government said four civilians trying to flee the region were shot to death by Russian forces. The Russians, in their turn, have accused the “neo-Nazi nationalists” in Mariupol of hampering the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol. __ KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s state security service has posted a video of a Ukrainian politician held on a treason charge offering himself in exchange for the evacuation of Mariupol’s trapped civilians, while two British men who surrendered to Russian forces in Mariupol appeared on Russian media asking to be part of an exchange. The video of Viktor Medvedchuk, the former leader of a pro-Russian opposition party with personal ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was posted Monday. In it, he appeals to Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by name to consider the exchange. Medvedchuk was detained last Tuesday in a special operation carried out by Ukraine’s state security service, or the SBU. The 67-year-old oligarch had escaped from house arrest several days before the hostilities broke out Feb. 24 in Ukraine. He is facing 15 years to life in prison on charges of treason and aiding and abetting a terrorist organization for mediating coal purchases for the separatist Russia-backed Donetsk republic in eastern Ukraine. The British men identified themselves as Sean Pinner and Aiden Aslin. In one video, Pinner asked British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to be exchanged. Pinner had deep circles beneath his eyes and appeared exhausted, but said he and Aslin had been treated appropriately. Ukrainian officials have said Kyiv wants try Medvedchuk and ultimately exchange him for Ukrainian prisoners. The circumstances of the videos were unclear. The two videos were released within an hour of each other. ___ ROME — Italian officials will go ahead with an energy-deal trip to Africa this week as part of Premier Mario Draghi’s efforts to quickly reduce the country’s heavy reliance of Russian gas, but he won’t be going because he has tested positive for COVID-19. The premier’s office, announcing the infection, said on Monday that Draghi has no symptoms. The mission to Angola and Congo, set for Wednesday and Thursday, will instead see the government represented by its ministers of foreign affairs and of ecological transition. Italy buys almost 40% of its gas from Russia. Draghi is determined to drastically reduce that reliance in the next two or three years, in large part by sealing deals with other energy producing countries. Draghi recently traveled to Algeria to make such an agreement as part of the strategy. ___ MADRID -- Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez says Spain will reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in a few days. Following similar decisions by several European neighbors, Sánchez said the reopening will “show again the commitment of the Spanish government and Spanish people with the Ukrainian people.” “Spain is with Ukraine and we are against (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,” Sánchez said in an interview on Spain’s Antena 3 television. “This is a war by Putin against what the European Union stands for.” Spain closed the embassy within hours of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. ___ KYIV, Ukraine — Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said seven people were killed and another 11, including a child, were wounded by Russian strikes in the western Ukrainian city. Plumes of thick black smoke were seen by Associated Press journalists in Lviv, rising over the city amid multiple explosions believed to be caused by missiles strikes. Lviv Regional Governor Maksym Kozytskyy said there were four Russian missile strikes, three of which hit military infrastructure facilities and one struck a tire shop. He said emergency teams were putting out the fires. Oleksandr Kamyshin, the chairman of the Ukrainian rail service, said the strikes hit near railway facilities. He said train traffic has resumed with some delays, and he vowed to restore the damaged network. Lviv and the rest of western Ukraine has been less affected by the fighting than other parts of the country, and is considered to be a relatively safe haven. ___ MOSCOW — The Russian military says it has struck over 20 Ukrainian military targets with missiles. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that precision-guided air-launched missiles destroyed 16 military facilities, including five command headquarters, a fuel depot, three ammunition depots and concentrations of Ukrainian military vehicles and personnel in the Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro regions. Konashenkov said the military also fired Iskander land-based missiles to destroy four ammunition depots and three groups of Ukrainian troops near Popasna and Kramatorsk in the east and Yampil in central Ukraine. He said that the military used artillery to hit 315 Ukrainian targets, and Russian warplanes performed 108 strikes targeting Ukrainian troops and military equipment. Konashenkov’s claims couldn’t be independently verified. ___ LONDON — Britain’s defense ministry says the continuing siege of Mariupol is tying up Russian forces and slowing its advance ahead of a planned major offensive in eastern Ukraine. In a daily intelligence update, Britain’s military says “concerted Ukrainian resistance has severely tested Russian forces and diverted men and materiel, slowing Russia’s advance elsewhere.” The Sea of Azov port city has been devastated in weeks of Russian pummeling. Britain says “large areas of infrastructure have been destroyed” and there are “significant” civilian casualties. Britain accuses Russia of using tactics of all-out war on civilian areas similar to its attacks in Chechnya and Syria, despite Russian claims at the start of its invasion “that Russia would neither strike cities nor threaten the Ukrainian population.” ___ LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian troops in southern Ukraine have been carrying out torture and kidnappings, and he called on the world Sunday to respond. “Torture chambers are built there,” Zelenskyy said in an evening address to the nation. “They abduct representatives of local governments and anyone deemed visible to local communities.” Zelenskyy said humanitarian aid has been stolen, creating famine. In occupied parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, he said, the Russians are creating separatist states and introducing Russian currency, the ruble. Intensified Russian shelling of Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, has killed 18 people and wounded 106 in the last four days alone, Zelenskyy said. “This is nothing but deliberate terror. Mortars, artillery against ordinary residential neighborhoods, against ordinary civilians,” he said. He said a planned Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine “will begin in the near future.” Zelensky again called for increased sanctions against Russia targeting its entire banking sector and oil industry. “Everyone in Europe and America already sees Russia openly using energy to destabilize Western societies,” Zelenskyy said. “All of this requires greater speed from Western countries in preparing a new, powerful package of sanctions.”",World/Associated Press,Live Updates | Russians fight in streets of Ukrainian town,https://news.yahoo.com/live-updates-lviv-mayor-says-061144377.html
4/20/2022,"Kandis R. Majors and Terri Ann Seibeck found in each other a loving and supportive partner. Life hadn’t been easy for the two single mothers from West Frankfort, Illinois. “Kandis had a beautiful smile that lit up the room when she walked in. She had so many positive things going for her.” Majors’ mother, Cindy Marlow, told “Snapped: Killer Couples,” airing Sundays at 6/5c on Oxygen. Majors went through tough times, though. Hoping to turn her life around, Majors befriended Seibeck, who had faced many of the same challenges. She too had had gone through similar issues and had no family to fall back on. “I think they needed each other just because they had issues with past drug addictions, trauma, they both wanted to get on a better path and do good for their kids,” friend Jessi Hurley told “Killer Couples.” Majors and Seibeck supported each other’s sobriety and moved in together in 2007. Seibeck worked for her father’s painting business while Majors was training to become a radiologist. Things were turning around for them both. “Kandis and Terri had talked to me on many occasions about how much in love they were and they did have future plans to get married,” said Hurley. On October 19, 2009, Seibeck’s aunt called 911. Seibeck had missed work and no one could get in touch with her or Majora. Seibeck’s aunt owned the house where the couple lived and went to the property. She saw the front door was covered in blood and waited for officers from the West Frankfort Police Department to arrive. “As I pushed the door open approximately five, six inches, toes came beneath the door and you could see the blood on them,” former West Frankfort Police Chief Jeff Tharp told ""Killer Couples."" Inside the home were the dead bodies of Majors, 28, and Seibeck, 32. An autopsy determined they were shot in the head multiple times at close range by a small-caliber handgun, according to Cape Girardeau Missouri, CBS-affiliate KFVS. Both victims’ credit cards and IDs were missing as was Seibeck’s Chevrolet Impala. However, there were no signs of a break-in and other valuables were left behind. In speaking with the women’s friends, detectives learned another couple had been living with them. They were identified as Afton Ferris, 19, and Michael Schallert, 29. Detectives learned that Majors and Seibeck had accused Ferris and Schallert of stealing from them and kicked them out on October 18. They then stayed with a friend, who told police the couple left in the middle of the night and stole his .22 Ruger handgun, according to local newspaper the Benton Evening News. A day after the murder, Afton D. Ferris and Michael Anthony Schallert were named as “persons of interest” in the murder of Kandis Majors and Terri Seibeck, reported KFVS. In speaking with Schallert’s family, they learned his friendship with Seibeck went back years. They found it hard to believe he was behind such brutal acts of violence. Born in 1979, Schallert grew up in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He became a father at 15, which forever altered the course of his life. As an adult, Schallert drifted around the Midwest, working odd jobs and moving from place to place. He met Seibeck in West Frankfort and she allowed him to stay with her for a period. Schallert returned to Cheyenne in 2008, where he met Ferris, then 18. She had grown up in foster care, and despite being valedictorian of her high school, was unable to hold down a job. She was homeless when they met. “He did become kind of obsessed with Afton. It wasn’t necessarily an obsession, like, a crazy obsession, it was, ‘I will do anything I have to for this person for them to love me,'” sister Shauna Schallert told “Killer Couples."" Michael Schallert asked Shauna if Ferris could move in with her. Having just given birth to a young child, Shauna refused, so the couple made their way back to West Frankfort. Seibeck allowed Ferris and Schallert to stay in the home she shared with Majors. However, the situation soon went south. “About a month after they moved in, I spoke with Terri on the phone and she just seemed really frustrated saying some of their things had come up missing,” Hurley said. “She told me that no one else had been in the house."" Believing Ferris and Schallert were stealing from them, Seibeck and Majors kicked the couple out. Less than 24 hours later, they were dead. Investigators soon obtained security camera footage from a local gas station that showed Schallert filling up Seibeck’s car and paying for it with Majors’ credit card, according to the Benton Evening News. Activity on Majors’ credit card helped investigators track the couple to Larimer County, Colorado. They learned Schallert had a friend who lived in a trailer park in Fort Collins and spotted Seibeck’s car parked outside. Afton Ferris and Michael Schallert were taken into custody on October 21, 2009. Insider the the trailer, authorities found blood-stained clothing belonging to Ferris, stolen credit cards, and a black purse containing the murder weapon, according to KFVS. A handwritten poem titled ""Bullets and Weed"" was found inside Majors’ car, which was signed by Ferris, according to WFVS. ""Seems like we got no where to run to, and no way to go back,” it reads “Guess the only way to go, is to take this handful of bullets and pocketful of weed.” Another note found inside the car read, ""We are sorry we did this, I wish we hadn't done this, but we had been pushed too far. Terri & Kandice were thieves and liars & they continuously stole from one another & blamed it on somebody else, and we continuously got the blame,"" according to WFVS. In her interview with police, Ferris admitted to stealing the murder weapon. She said they originally intended to rob Seibeck and Majors but when they got to their house decided to kill them. “We didn’t have any other choice,” Ferris says in footage of her interview with police, which was obtained by “Killer Couples.” “It was the only option we had.” Ferris said that in order to gain entrance into the home, Schallert said they wanted to apologize. Instead, he gunned the women down in cold blood. “He’s like, ‘You know what, motherf—ker?’ and he shot [Majors] and she went backwards, and then he shot Terri. She hit the coffee table,” said Ferris. She said she saw Majors was attempting to escape and call the sheriff's department, so she grabbed her and brought her back in, while Schallert shot her again. “Terri, she was moaning and groaning and I told him, ‘Give me the gun,’ and I shot her in her left eye,” Ferris then told detectives. In his interview with police, Schallert admitted to murdering Seibeck and Majors with Ferris’ help. He said he and Ferris were planning to die by suicide, according to WFVS. “We just walked in and she started blaming Afton for stealing some CDs and me for a tank top shirt and I just couldn’t take it no more and I had that gun. I just pulled the trigger, I don’t even know how many times,” Schallert says in his videotaped police interview, which was obtained by “Snapped.” “Then it got jammed and Afton told me to reload it. I reloaded it and she shot a couple times."" Following their confessions, Afton Ferris and Michael Schallert were charged with two counts each of murder in the first degree, according to The Denver Post newspaper. In August 2011, Michael Schallert pleaded guilty to two counts of murder in the first degree and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, reported Southern Illinois’ Harrisburg Register newspaper. A jury found Afton Ferris guilty on two counts each of murder, home invasion, and armed robbery in July 2011. She was subsequently sentenced to natural life without the possibility of parole, according to the Benton Evening News.

4/20/2022,"(Note language that may offend some readers in paragraph 9) LONDON (Reuters) - Wealthy Russian businessman Oleg Tinkov on Tuesday condemned what he called Moscow's ""crazy war"" in Ukraine, saying 90% of his countrymen did not support it and calling on the West to offer Vladimir Putin a dignified way to withdraw. ""I don't see a single beneficiary of this crazy war! Innocent people and soldiers are dying,"" Tinkov, who founded Tinkoff Bank, Russia's second biggest credit card issuer, wrote in an Instagram post, one of the most outspoken broadsides against the conflict by a Russian tycoon. President Putin ordered troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country. Kyiv and Western governments reject these arguments as false pretexts for an attack and have imposed sanctions against Russian companies and individuals - including Tinkov - in a bid to force Putin to retreat. Several Russian billionaires have publicly called for peace, but many Russians have rallied to the Kremlin, which has whipped up support with a publicity campaign using the ""Z"" logo of the armed forces. ""Of course there are morons who draw Z, but 10% of any country are morons. 90% of Russians are AGAINST this war!"" wrote Tinkov, who has denied having any close relationship with Putin or the Kremlin. ""Kremlin officials are shocked that neither they or their children will be off to the Mediterranean in the summer. Businessmen are trying to save the rest of their property,"" he said. Russia's offensive in Ukraine quickly stalled in the face of stiff Ukrainian resistance and Moscow has abandoned assaults on the capital Kyiv in the north of the country to launch a new offensive in the east. ""The (Russian) generals, waking up with a hangover, realized that they had a shit army,"" Tinkov wrote. ""And how could the army be good if everything else in the country is shit and mired in nepotism, sycophancy and servility?"" Switching to English, Tinkov wrote: ""Dear 'collective West' please give Mr. Putin a clear exit to save his face and stop this massacre. Please be more rational and humanitarian."" Tinkov owns around 35% of Cyprus-based TCS Group Holding, whose stable of companies under the Tinkoff brand span sectors from banking and insurance to mobile services. The company's share price has plummeted this year. Tinkov, 54, stepped down as chairman of Tinkoff Bank in 2020. TCS said last month Tinkov did not occupy any decision-making position and sanctions against him would not affect the company. It is not clear whether Tinkov is currently in Russia.
