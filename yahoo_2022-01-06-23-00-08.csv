1/6/2022,"“Scored zero. Not a bigot or racist, just very, very ignorant,” was the email I got from a University of Louisville faculty member who took the test Ricky Jones created for me to show that tests can be written to put one race or one group of people at a disadvantage. I hear you, brother. As I wrote recently, I got only five out of 25 questions correct – a miserable, paltry, horrible, embarrassing 20%. In all, more than 100 people reported back. Most of you are about as dumb as I am. You didn't know a lot about W.E.B. Du Bois, Hiram Rhodes Revels or Madam C.J. Walker. Ricky L. Jones: Why Joe Gerth failed my test on Black people (and you probably will, too) Jones, the chairman of the Pan African Studies Department at U of L, created the test for me after he said last fall that the American education system is rigged against Black students. He said then he could make a test that few, if any, white people in Louisville could pass. I challenged him to make the test for me – and after I failed it, I challenged you to take it and tell me your score. You wrote from as far away as the United Kingdom and ranged from people with high school diplomas to lawyers and engineers. Some of you were Black; some white. Two judges even took time out to write – one of them embarrassed by how she did, and another reporting that he passed the test but questioning Jones’ premise and what the test showed. Some of you had racist feelings about the test, telling me that the reason we don’t learn in school about Black people is because Black people have done little for us to learn about. “The reason history is told from a European perspective is because almost every significant event, invention and innovation involves or was created by whites,” wrote Brad, who went on to list a number of areas where he thought white people have excelled while African Americans faltered. (Jones acknowledged to me that there are several areas in which African Americans aren’t nearly as accomplished as white people, including chattel slavery and wiping out Native American populations.) “The car “The airplane “The helicopter “Dynamite,” Brad wrote, beginning his long list of inventions where he believes Black people haven't made significant advances.

Johnson in the early years of the space race or contributions from Black astronauts like Mae Jemison and Ronald McNair. Most of us would have never heard of Johnson if we hadn’t seen the movie “Hidden Figures,” which came out in 2016, more than 50 years after she was instrumental in putting John Glenn into orbit. Some criticized Jones’ test because they didn’t believe the test showed what Jones was trying to show – while at the same time agreeing with him that the system is designed to benefit some students based on race and income. In all, four people who reported back to me said they passed the test. One of them was Black and the others were white. One of those who passed said they had taken classes in college on African American culture. One of them is an expert in trivia and general knowledge. More Gerth: 'It's just disbelief': As Kentucky tornado death toll rises, a funeral director waits How smart you are didn’t necessarily matter, however. One woman said she has a genius I.Q. and she failed badly. “I got exactly one question right: the number of countries in Africa. I got it right ONLY because I saw a Tik Tok recently by a Black creator who mentioned this fact. “How embarrassing,” Hally wrote. I’m not giving out full names because when I asked people to email me their scores, I promised I wouldn’t out them as being as dumb as I felt after my dismal performance. Some were critical that the questions Jones asked weren’t like the multiple-choice questions about math, science and reading comprehension that you would see on SAT or ACT tests. Jones acknowledged that and said such open-ended questions are often found on Advanced Placement tests. But, he said, that really doesn’t matter. One person suggested he could create a ""White History Test"" with similarly difficult questions that would stump white test takers. He threw out four potential questions that would be on the test. I knew the answers to three of them and the one that I missed was about Shakespeare's ""Hamlet."" I haven't read Shakespeare in 40 years. Even still, had he asked me to recite the witch's incantation from Macbeth, I would have nailed it. The whole point behind the test was to show how schools typically don’t teach about Black people and their accomplishments, Jones said. “That fractures their sense of identity,” Jones said. “These children all the way from junior kindergarten through college are given a European sense of history. … They leave (the education system) with the idea that white people are the center of the universe.” Jones said that leaves Black children “fractured, broken and disengaged; it leaves white kids with a false sense of superiority and it leaves Black kids with a false sense of inferiority.” But for the most part, the respondents took the test for what it was – an exercise to show exactly how much we don’t know about Black history, Black culture and the headwinds that Black students face in schools dominated by people of all colors who were raised in white educational programs.

1/6/2022,"The triangle of death is the area of your face including your upper lip, nose, and between your eyebrows. Popping a pimple in this area can lead to major infections because of its location. Dermatologists recommend using ingredients like benzoyl peroxide and retinoids instead of popping. Never pop a zit in the ""triangle of death,"" dermatologists say, no matter how tempting it is. The triangle of death is the area of skin that starts at the middle of your eyebrows, includes your nose, and ends at your top lip. You can identify it by creating a triangle with your hands and touching the tip formed by your index fingers to the middle of your eyebrows and the bottom corners to the corners of your mouth, according to dermatologist Dr. Corey L. Hartman. Hartman told Insider people should proceed with caution when treating acne in this area because DIY extractions can lead to serious infections and even death. ""Theoretically, it can lead to meningitis and other infections of the central nervous system since there is proximity to the brain,"" Hartman said. At-home pimple popping is generally frowned upon by dermatologists, as it can lead to scarring and more acne. But what makes squeezing zits in the triangle of danger so much riskier has to do with its location. ""The area of the face connecting the nose to the corners of the mouth is thought to be a particularly dangerous area of the face because of their close connection to the brain,"" Dr. Joshua Zeichner, a dermatologist at Mount Sinai in New York, told Health. The area underneath the triangle contains major sinuses that connect to the brain. Popping a pimple above these sinuses can create a chain reaction of infection that leads to the brain, Hartman said. Hartman said the deeper the pimple and more infected it is, the more likely it is to lead to severe infection or death, though death is still rare. Addressing acne in this area of the face should be handled with care. Hartman recommends using preventative measure, like a skincare routine that includes acne-fighting ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide, hydroxy acids, and retinoids. If the pimple persists, resist the urge to squeeze it. Instead, seek professional advice. ""Seek the help of a board certified dermatologist or licensed aesthetician to extract, inject or otherwise treat problematic pimples that prove to be persistent and resistant to topical therapies,"" Hartman said.

1/6/2022,"By Philip Pullella VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis took an apparent dig at conservatives resisting change in the Roman Catholic Church on Thursday, lamenting those whose religion he said was self-referential and encased in a ""suit of armour"". On the Feast of the Epiphany, Francis seemed to direct specific criticism at those who have balked at his decision to restrict the traditionalist Latin Mass, saying the liturgy could not be trapped in a ""dead language."" ""Have we been stuck all too long, nestled inside a conventional, external and formal religiosity that no longer warms our hearts and changes our lives?,"" Francis said. ""Do our words and our liturgies ignite in people's hearts a desire to move towards God, or are they a 'dead language' that speaks only of itself and to itself?"" The Latin Mass went out of general use after the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council and was substituted by local languages. In July, having argued that the Latin Mass was being exploited by anti-reformists to harm the Church's unity, Francis tightened regulations on when it could be celebrated, overturning decisions by his two predecessors. Since then some conservatives, including bishops, have openly defied the pope, resulting in the latest chapter of what some have dubbed the Church's ""liturgy wars"". Faith was not ""a suit of armour that encases us; instead, it is a fascinating journey, a constant and restless movement, ever in search of God,"" Francis said. The pope made his comments in the homily at a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica on the day Christians commemorate what the Bible says was the arrival of the three wise men, or magi, in Bethlehem following Jesus' birth. Participation was limited to about 1,500 people because of COVID-19 restrictions.
