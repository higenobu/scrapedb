1/12/2022,"The comedian Bob Saget died on Sunday. Users on a far-right forum and Telegram channels are spreading baseless theories about how he died. The false claims follow similar posts about Betty White. Anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists are using Bob Saget's death to spread COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. The stand-up comedian and ""Full House"" actor was found dead in his room at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Florida on Sunday. A preliminary autopsy found that there was ""no evidence of drug use or foul play,"" according to a press release previously seen by Insider, and no cause of death has been reported as of Tuesday afternoon. Numerous users on far-right fringe forums were spreading a baseless conspiracy theory on Tuesday that the 65-year-old died after receiving a COVID-19 booster shot — which is safe and effective in thwarting serious disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The false claims follow similar posts about Betty White, who died earlier this month. Saget was a vaccine advocate and said in the December 13 episode of his podcast, ""Bob Saget's Here For You,"" that he had recently received the booster shot. One Telegram user with a history of sharing anti-vaccine conspiracy theories posted that podcast clip to their channel on Monday, adding a caption about Saget taking the booster shot with a teary-eyed emoji at the end. The clip was reshared by other conspiracy theorists on Telegram and has amassed over 19,000 views. Inside a Telegram channel for an influencer linked to the conspiracy theory movement QAnon, multiple users wrote comments about how it ""must be the jab,"" referring to the vaccine, on a post about Saget's death. One post on a far-right online forum baselessly alleging Saget died from the booster shot received over 1,200 likes. Multiple other users on that website baselessly alleged that he died from vaccine-induced heart issues. At least several Twitter users have also baselessly alleged or speculated that the COVID-19 vaccine or booster shot led to Saget's death. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.

1/12/2022,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell defended fellow GOP Sen. Mike Rounds after Trump criticized him. Trump said Rounds ""went woke"" for acknowledging that the 2020 election was fair. ""Sen. Rounds told the truth,"" McConnell said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday defended fellow GOP Sen. Mike Rounds after former President Donald Trump fiercely condemned Rounds for acknowledging that the 2020 presidential election was fair. ""I think Sen. Rounds told the truth about what happened in the 2020 election,"" McConnell told CNN. ""And I agree with him."" McConnell's support comes after Rounds earlier this week rejected Trump's debunked claims that Democrats ""rigged"" the 2020 presidential election and that he would have won reelection if not for widespread voter fraud. ""The election was fair — as fair as we've seen,"" Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, said Sunday in an ABC News interview. ""We simply did not win the election as Republicans for the presidency."" Trump seized on the comments and issued a sharp rebuke to the senator the next day, saying he ""just went woke on the Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020."" ""Is he crazy or just stupid?"" Trump went on, adding that he will never endorse Rounds again. Rounds handily won reelection in his deep red state in 2020. ""The only reason he did this is because he got my endorsement and easily won his state in 2020, so now he thinks he has time, and those are the only ones, the weak, who will break away. Even though his election will not be coming up for 5 years, I will never endorse this jerk again,"" Trump said. Rounds later doubled down on his earlier statements about the 2020 election in response to Trump's criticism. ""I stand by my statement. The former president lost the 2020 election,"" he said. McConnell has tried to shift the GOP's focus away from the 2020 presidential election, clashing with Trump's continued fixation on it. McConnell has signaled that his priorities are opposing the Biden administration's agenda and preparing for the 2022 midterm elections as Republicans vie to retake the House and Senate majorities. Rounds expressed a similar sentiment on Sunday, making a call to focus on future elections rather than past. ""Moving forward, we have to refocus once again on what it's going to take to win the presidency,"" Rounds told ABC News. ""And if we simply look back and tell our people don't vote because there's cheating going on, then we're going to put ourselves in a huge disadvantage.""

1/12/2022,"A top Democrat is asking the House Sergeant at Arms to force maskless lawmakers to vote from the gallery. Rep. Katherine Clark noted that fines hadn't deterred people like Marjorie Taylor Greene from going maskless. But Greene told Insider that members at risk for COVID ""may not be fit to do the job."" A top House Democratic lawmaker is asking the House Sergeant at Arms to require maskless members of Congress to cast their votes from ""isolation boxes"" in the House gallery above the main floor, citing the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. In a letter on Tuesday, Assistant House Speaker Rep. Katherine Clark said that ""fines have proven insufficient to prevent some Members from repeatedly violating"" the House's mask-wearing rules, which include a $500 fine for the first offense and $2,500 for each offense after that. ""This commonsense step will not only protect our dedicated House staff from Members who refuse to follow House rules, but it will also allow those members to continue to fulfill their constitutional duty to vote on matters before the House."" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican who's repeatedly ignored the masking rules, was dismissive of the idea in a brief phone call with Insider on Tuesday. She suggested that members who feel threatened by the virus aren't fit to serve in Congress. ""I'll argue that they may not be fit to do the job,"" said Greene. ""Maybe they need to consider that they are the ones in the risk group, and they should just go sit it out until they feel safe to come out."" The congresswoman has said she's unvaccinated and was recently banned from Twitter for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and the efficacy of the vaccines. The fines for failing to wear a mask are deducted from members' paychecks, and Greene and fellow Georgia GOP Rep. Andrew Clyde have together lost over $100,000 from their salaries due to repeated violations of the rule, which Clark noted in her letter. —Katherine Clark (@RepKClark) January 11, 2022 House Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer is also advising members to wear N95 or KN95 masks on the House floor, regardless of vaccination status, and is strongly discouraging congregating during votes. Ahead of votes on Tuesday, Insider saw GOP Rep. Mary Miller of Illinois walk into the Capitol building maskless, only to be handed a KN95 mask before entering the House chamber. ""Does Nancy have one of these? She had a cloth one yesterday,"" she said, making a sarcastic reference to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. During the pandemic, the House has instituted a ""proxy voting"" system that allows members to designate another member to vote for them, allowing them to avoid the chamber if they're worried about the COVID-19 risk. Greene called the House's rules illogical, citing the fact that the mask mandate only applies in the chamber itself, and said that only those who are in at-risk groups should be concerned about the virus. ""Most of Congress is vaccinated, so if vaccines work, they should feel completely safe,"" she said. The Georgia Republican also brought up Ivermectin, a drug that the FDA explicitly advises against using to treat COVID-19. While Greene declined to say whether she herself has contracted COVID or used the drug, she said her husband had. ""I can tell you right now,"" she said. ""There's a lot of members of Congress that have taken it. And I've known a lot of people that have taken ivermectin and got well."" Greene also noted that the isolation boxes were initially created to allow COVID-positive members of Congress to attend votes, which was important as Pelosi sought to whip votes for the speakership in 2021. ""Now all of a sudden, it has to turn into, oh no, we're gonna put the people in the box who aren't wearing a mask,"" said Greene. Asked what she would do if Clark's request is approved, Greene was unsure. ""I don't know what's going to happen,"" she said. ""I mean, this has never happened before in the history of our country.""
