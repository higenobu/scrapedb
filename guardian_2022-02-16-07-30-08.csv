2/16/2022,"After 588 minutes of football and 47 days, the great drought is over. Cristiano Ronaldo, the man who has scored more than anyone else in the history of football, scored a goal, his first of 2022 and his first as a 37-year-old. In the process, a serial Champions League winner put Manchester United in the position to return them to the European elite, he and Bruno Fernandes sending them back up to fourth. Ronaldo had not gone seven games without a goal since 2009 and Brighton have never won at Old Trafford. The opening exchanges suggested history could be made but Albion ended up ruing a disastrous three-minute spell when Ronaldo struck and Lewis Dunk was sent off.  Ralf Rangnick asked Sascha Lense, his sports psychologist, to address United’s players about their problem of losing first-half leads. His words may not have had the desired effect as they limped in with parity at the break after lacking the initial incision they have shown of late. Their meaningful efforts before the interval amounted to a Cristiano Ronaldo free-kick that hit the wall and a lone good chance. Even that was courtesy of a defensive mistake as Jadon Sancho could have opened the scoring for the third consecutive match at Old Trafford. Ronaldo has a habit of lingering offside and what looked like laziness brought a reward when Adam Webster misjudged a punt forward, releasing the striker. He played the ball into the path of the advancing Sancho with a cute backheel, but Robert Sánchez proved equal to the winger’s shot. Yet while Sancho was United’s sprightliest attacker at the start, most of those to make a positive early impression were in blue and white. It was a sign of the ambition in Brighton’s approach that they had 59% of possession in the first period, much of it in United’s half. With a quarter of the game gone, Rangnick switched to a 4-2-3-1 formation in an attempt to gain control but Graham Potter shaped the game by configuring his side with a midfield diamond. If the intention was to outnumber United in the centre of the pitch, it also provided a goal threat. He has a squad brimming with creativity. He opted for Jakub Moder at No 10 and both his choice of system and individual almost produced a dividend. After an error from the recalled Fred — a penny for the dropped Paul Pogba’s thoughts as he watched his replacement play an inexplicably poor pass — Pascal Gross released the overlapping Moder. His shot was blocked by David de Gea. Moder continued to demonstrate the ability to elude the United defence. De Gea denied him for a second time, with a flying save from a forceful header after Joel Veltman crossed. When Moder picked out Yves Bissouma, who had surged forward from the base of the diamond, he blazed over. A mitigating factor for United was the late withdrawal of Raphaël Varane, who was named in the side but reported ill, and without him they struggled to track Brighton’s runners. When United led, it was partly due to their veteran scorer and partly Rangnick’s brand of football. The coach could be forgiven for savouring the manner of Scott McTominay’s assist as he picked the pocket of the previously excellent Bissouma to set up Ronaldo. His barren spell was ended in trademark fashion, with a shot with little backlift that nevertheless nestled in the corner of the net. United’s harrying in the final third produced a second dividend a minute later as Anthony Elanga robbed Dunk. The Brighton captain hauled the teenager down and while referee Peter Bankes settled for a yellow card, United’s protests were so vociferous that Bruno Fernandes was also booked. The VAR Jarred Gillet sent Bankes to the pitchside monitor to review the incident and the card was upgraded to a red. Ronaldo almost scored a second, with Sánchez producing an acrobatic save from his header, as United assumed the initiative. They never relinquished it. Sánchez had to make a fine stop from Fernandes, making amends for his own mistake in passing straight to Ronaldo. If his unselfishness in passing to his compatriot came because he had already scored, he may have regretted it when Fernandes proved less predatory. When Moder struck the bar with a terrific shot, that miss threatened to be costly. Instead, Fernandes streaked clear in the 96th minute to seal victory.",Sport/Football,Cristiano Ronaldo ends drought to seal Manchester United win over Brighton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/15/manchester-united-brighton-match-report-premier-league
2/16/2022,"Suddenly, there was Kylian Mbappé. With 45 seconds left, at last he found a way through and the solution that PSG had sought all night. Dashing between Lucas Vázquez and Éder Militão he dropped the shoulder and slotted a superb shot into the net to secure a victory that had appeared set to evade them, this place erupting. They had waited all night for this but it had been worth it, and the win had been deserved. It took 22 shots, including a penalty that Messi saw saved by Thibaut Courtois, but they had finally done it. And it had to be him, the man who had started it all ending it too.  The first glimpse of Mbappé came with a smooth, swift turn away from Casemiro inside the opening minute that set the tone. If Casemiro was more successful in the very next minute when he slid in on Messi and swept the ball from the Argentinian’s feet, it would return there often as PSG took a control that was overwhelming at times. Messi was dropping deep, as willing to play the first pass as the last pass; Marco Verratti and Leandro Paredes kept the ball moving; and Ángel Di María was all over the place. Mbappé prowled the left side, where Dani Carvajal was isolated and from where PSG created the chance that should have given them the lead. Messi spread it wide to Mbappé and his cross was fast, low and accurate – but from the edge of the six-yard box, Di María sent a shot high over the bar. Madrid could find no way out. One dash forward just before the half-hour was virtually the first time they had got into PSG’s half and their first effort on goal, a Militão header, was the last touch of the opening 45 minutes. The good news for Carlo Ancelotti’s team was that while Mbappé scared them, the threat palpable every time he accelerated, there were few clear chances and the home side’s momentum slipped, everyone settling into a slower pace. PSG’s possession was up at 70% on 30 minutes but had started to decline, as had their incision. The best chance PSG made came from a wonderful ball that Messi dropped behind the Madrid defence, with the ball sitting up for Mbappé. However with Carvajal giving him a push in the back, Mbappé couldn’t get a clean contact and Courtois made a save. From the corner, he dived to deny PSG again. As the game went on, that felt increasingly like an opportunity lost. Casemiro received a yellow card that means he will miss the second leg and he might have received another booking for reaching at the neck of Paredes, but by the break that was the extent of the damage. Courtois ensured there wasn’t more when he produced another of his now statutory miracles, diving low to his right to save from Mbappé. PSG began the second half determined to increase the pressure and ensure that their opportunity would not be wasted. Next it was Militão charging down an Mbappé shot as Ferland Mendy was caught inside his own area, Achraf Hakimi perhaps a little slow to find a target for his pull-back. Shots from Mbappé and Messi were simpler to save, but PSG were pushing now, Madrid forced further back, right into their area. From there, Militão blocked Messi as he moved into that shooting position. If that was familiar so was the position from which Mbappé won a penalty, taken out by Carvajal. The defender’s dive was despairing, his goalkeeper’s superb, Courtois flying left to save Messi’s weak spot-kick. This was 15 PSG shots now to Madrid’s two, but still the ball wouldn’t go in and there was a flash of desperation when Messi took a shot off Paredes’s foot a moment later. Something had to change and so, to a roar, on came Neymar. Immediately he dribbled round the referee and towards the Madrid area, where he was dumped on the turf. Messi bent the resulting free-kick wide. A moment later those two combined superbly, Messi’s clipped ball just evading Mbappé from close range. Then Mbappé curled past the far post. There was a lull, almost as if they knew the moment had been lost, but the Parc de Princes rose again when Messi dribbled through with five minutes to go and slipping the ball through to Neymar. With Courtois coming out to him, Neymar clipped over him and beyond the teammates charging into the area. Mbappé headed towards the same gap in the last minute going all the way to the byline, right by the post, and pulling across the six-yard box, where there was no one to provide the final touch. It had been that kind of night, or so it seemed. Somehow Madrid were still standing, bringing it all back to the Bernabéu for another go, when in the 94th minute Mbappé went on one last run.",Sport/Football,Mbappé gives PSG late win over Real Madrid after Messi has penalty saved,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/15/psg-real-madrid-champions-league-last-16-match-report
2/16/2022,"Joe Biden has claimed that 150,000 Russian troops remain in a “threatening position” around Ukraine, despite Russian claims of a withdrawal, and he warned that an invasion “remains distinctly possible”. In a televised address from the White House on Tuesday afternoon, Biden combined a repeated offer of security talks with a warning of severe repercussions if Russia carries out an attack that US intelligence has reportedly assessed could take place as early as Wednesday.  He said he would “rally the world” to oppose Russian military action but made clear that the response would be primarily economic, saying: “I will not send American servicemen to fight in Ukraine.” But he made clear that any attack on Nato territory or harm to Americans would be treated differently. “We’re not seeking direct confrontation with Russia, though I’ve been clear that if Russia targets Americans and Ukraine, we will respond forcefully,” Biden said. “If Russia attacks the United States or our allies through asymmetric means, like disruptive cyber-attacks against our companies or critical infrastructure, we’re prepared to respond.” Earlier in the day, the websites run by the Ukrainian defence ministry, the armed forces and the country’s largest commercial bank, PrivatBank, were closed down after a cyber-attack. The Washington Post cited intelligence sources as saying the attack was probably the work of Russian government hackers, but the White House said it could not comment on attribution. Biden was speaking hours after Vladimir Putin had claimed that a “partial” drawdown of Russian forces from the Ukrainian border. Asked for the reason for the drawdown on Tuesday, Putin was not forthcoming. “It’s a partial withdrawal of troops from the areas of our exercises,” he said in response to a question during a press conference with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. “What is there to comment on?” In his televised address, Biden made clear the US was unconvinced by the Kremlin’s claims of a withdrawal. “We have not yet verified that Russian military units are returning to their home bases. Indeed our analysts indicate that they remain very much in a threatening position,” the president said. “The fact remains right now Russia has more than 150,000 troops encircling Ukraine and Belarus and along Ukraine’s border. An invasion remains distinctly possible.” Russia has always denied planning to invade Ukraine, saying it can exercise troops on its own territory as it sees fit. It has been pressing for a set of security guarantees from the west, including a guarantee that Ukraine will never join Nato. Biden repeated the US and Nato position that they will not compromise on the right of Ukraine and other countries to decide their own security policy, including alliances. “The United States has put on the table concrete ideas to establish a security environment in Europe. We’re proposing new arms control measures, new transparency measures, new strategic stability measures,” the president said. “We are willing to make practical result-oriented steps that can advance our common security. We will not sacrifice basic principles, though. Nations have a right to sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Addressing the Russian people directly, the president said: “You are not our enemy, and I do not believe you want a bloody destructive war against Ukraine, a country and the people with whom you share such deep ties of family history and culture.” “If Russia does invade in the days and weeks ahead, the human cost for Ukraine will be immense,” he said, adding it would be “a self-inflicted wound” for Russia. He also prepared Americans for consequences, saying: “I will not pretend this will be painless, there could be impact on our energy prices.” He pledged that his administration would take steps to mitigate that impact. In another sign of Russia turning the screw on Ukraine, the state duma voted on Tuesday to ask Putin to recognise the independence of the two Russian-controlled separatist regions in the east of the country. Putin, hinting that he intended to use them as leverage, said he would not recognise the “republics” immediately, but called on Nato to negotiate with him on Russia’s security guarantees before it was “too late”. “We hear that Ukraine is not ready to join Nato; we know that,” Putin said. “At the same time, they say it’s not going to join tomorrow. But by the time they get ready for it, it may be too late for us. So we have to decide this question now, right now, in the very near future, we have to have a negotiation process for this.” The drawdown was first announced on Tuesday morning by the defence ministry spokesperson, Igor Konashenkov, who described ongoing exercises that involved forces from “practically all military districts, fleets and the airborne forces”. The defence ministry released video apparently shot in Crimea of Russian tanks and other heavy weaponry from two brigades being loaded on to railway cars. Otherwise, the Russian military gave little information about which forces would be withdrawn and where they would be sent. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said: “We believe there is some ground for cautious optimism based on the signals and signs coming from Moscow, that they are ready to engage in a diplomatic effort and we are ready to continue to engage in a diplomatic effort.” Ukrainian officials said they would not take Moscow at its word about a drawdown. “Many statements are constantly being made from [Russia], so we have a rule: we’ll believe it when we see it,” said Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister. “If we see the withdrawal then we will believe in de-escalation.” The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused the west of manufacturing “manic information madness”. “We’ve always said the troops will return to their bases after the exercises are over. This is the case this time as well,” he said. Scholz arrived in Moscow on Tuesday for meetings with Putin, the latest in a series of visits and phone calls from western leaders seeking to avert a potential war through negotiations. Putin said he was “ready to work further” with the west on how to de-escalate the crisis on the Ukrainian border, while Germany’s chancellor said the diplomatic channels were “not yet exhausted”, at a joint press conference marked by subtle swipes and simmering historical resentment. “We are ready to work further together, we are ready to go down the negotiations track,” said Putin, who denied that his country was seeking an invasion of Ukraine. “As to whether we want [war]: of course not. That’s why we have made these proposals about negotiations, the results of which should be an agreement about equal security for all countries, including ours.” Russia has previously announced the conclusion of military exercises near the Ukrainian border, but social media and satellite photography taken in the following days have not shown considerable changes to Russia’s force posture. Those exercises involved only a small number of troops. Many of the troops located close to the Ukrainian border are not involved in any formal training. Russia is holding large joint exercises with Belarus scheduled to end on 20 February. Western countries have said those drills could be used as cover to prepare for an attack on Ukraine, while Russia has said the troops will return to base once the exercises have concluded. On Tuesday, Russia also deployed long-range nuclear-capable bombers and fighter jets carrying state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to its airbase in Syria for big naval drills in the region. Russia’s defence minister, Sergey Shoigu, met Syrian president Bashar al-Assad after arriving in Syria to oversee the drills that mark the biggest Russian naval deployment to the Mediterranean Sea since the cold war.

2/16/2022,"This Manchester City demolition of Sporting was akin to a heavyweight bullying a featherweight. Really, you wondered how these opponents shared the same pitch, so dominant were England’s champions. At the break Pep Guardiola’s men were four goals up, by the final whistle it was 5-0, and at the close of the tie they may go close to Bayern Munich’s 12-1 evisceration of Sporting at the same stage in 2008-09. That was the Portuguese club’s only previous experience of the last-16 and this lack of knowhow was written all over how City toyed with them and landed killer blows at will. A prime factor is, of course, the riches the side fuelled by Abu Dhabi’s petro-dollars enjoy: that should allow them to beat a significantly lower-budget operation like Sporting but so immaculately are they drilled by their manager, who might stop the City juggernaut finally claiming the Champions League this term is a puzzle.  The Estádio José Alvalade glittered from phone-torches that lit up the Lisbon night at kick-off and City had the perfect start. A move that featured Aymeric Laporte finding Bernardo Silva ended with Phil Foden’s shot being saved, Kevin De Bruyne passing the rebound to Riyad Mahrez, and the Algerian scoring. City appeared to think De Bruyne was offside but VAR ruled Gonçalo Inácio played the Belgian on, and so Mahrez had a 10th goal in his last 11 Champions League appearances. Sporting and their support were stunned. The Portuguese champions’ last outing, Friday’s 2-2 draw with Porto, ended in a mass brawl and three of their men sent off. In Rúben Amorim, they have a 37-year-old manager who cost the club €10m to prise from Braga and whose repayment was a cup-and-championship double, the latter a first title in 19 years. Amorim now had to somehow rally his men but, instead, City struck again. This time a Mahrez corner was weakly cleared and Silva pounced, rifling a superb half-volley past Antonio Adán for a 2-0 lead after only 17 minutes. Guardiola’s XI featured four old boys of Sporting’s crosstown rival, Benfica – João Cancelo, Rúben Dias, Silva and Ederson: initially booed whenever they took a touch before the home support focused on their team. For a while, Sporting showed flashes of promise. A Ricardo Esgaio raid along the left had City back-pedalling. Then, Pablo Sarabia looked to do the same but the No 17 ran infield and into John Stones, who ended the threat. In-between those moments Pedro Gonçalves, the scorer of four goals in the group stage, let fly twice. Guardiola, on the prowl in the technical area, was conscious of Sporting’s threat – a volley he gave Rúben Dias for not passing diagonally indicative of his concern. The Catalan was about to applaud his team, though. At first Dias, Rodri, and Stones played keep-ball in their half. But, then, De Bruyne was suddenly marauding towards goal, feeding Mahrez who pirouetted and crossed for Foden to finish – Sebastián Coates, the nearest defender, making it too simple for the forward. Three-nil up so soon pointed to the mismatch of the contest. City were illustrating precisely why they are the competition favourites and Sporting were showing how Ajax put five past them here in September. The rest of the period had City in a quasi-exhibition mode. Passes were interchanged, positions shifted, differing zones occupied. And, then, a fourth was secured: this time Silva’s strike was from close range, Raheem Sterling teeing him up. City’s travelling contingent ended the first half regaling their team. The second half, now, seemed a matter of how many more they might register. The Sporting fans, to their credit, kept singing but the way Cancelo, De Bruyne and Rodri harried their men suggested City were still targeting the jugular. They were: Silva finding the net again before his hat-trick was denied by VAR for offside. On the touchline, Guardiola next threw up his hands in dismay at an errant Dias chip forward, then he had a prolonged chat with the fourth official, his gestures suggesting unhappiness with the refereeing of Srdjan Jovanovic. More pleasing for him was how a rare Sporting attack was broken up and City, in their slick fashion, moved upfield via Rodri, De Bruyne and Cancelo. And even better was the team’s fifth goal. Here, Sterling’s finish was ruthless, the No 7’s long-range effort sailing into the top corner, this moving him to 10th on the club’s all-time list of scorers. This had entered embarrassing territory for Sporting. Portugal’s domestic champions were being made to appear a part-time outfit. There were no more goals – but only because City were content with tonight’s work. Guardiola may find minor faults in the display as he is a perfectionist. But, really, there were none.",Sport/Football,Silva leads Manchester City’s charge towards last eight in rout of Sporting,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/15/sporting-manchester-city-champions-league-last-16-match-report
2/16/2022,"All young people leaving care in Wales at the age of 18 are to be offered the chance to take part in a basic income pilot scheme under which they will receive £1,600 a month for up to two years. The money will be given unconditionally and participants will be able to earn from paid jobs on top of the basic income with ministers hoping it will help give some of the most vulnerable in society a better chance of thriving.  Officials, who investigated basic income schemes from California to Finland before designing the Welsh pilot, will study whether those who take part do better in the long term, financially, physically and emotionally, than young people who do not. The scheme, set to launch in the summer, is believed to be one of the most generous of its kind in the world and will cost the Welsh government £20m over three years. Those taking part will be taxed and will not be able to claim all benefits they would be entitled to if they were not given the money after the UK government refused to allow this. Benefits are not a devolved area. The move was welcomed by UBI Lab Wales, which campaigns on the concept of universal basic income, under which every citizen, regardless of their means, receives regular sums of money for life to cover the basic cost of living. Lowri Walters, of UBI Lab Wales, said: “While this proposal is not for a location-based basic income pilot with a wide range of participants, it represents a huge step forward for the UBI movement and a first for the UK. This will be a sizeable basic income for young people who need financial support at an uncertain and difficult point in their lives, and we’re confident that, if done properly, this pilot will demonstrate that a basic income can transform the lives of care leavers as well as citizens across Wales.” Welsh parliament member Jack Sargeant who led the Senedd’s first debate on UBI, said: “This is an incredibly bold move from a Welsh government that is leading the world in this area. We now need to ensure that we learn all we can from this trial. This is a real opportunity to show things can be different.” The Welsh minister for social justice, Jane Hutt, said the Labour-led government was committed to supporting the most vulnerable and tackling the “scourge of poverty.”. She said: “Too many young people leaving care continue to face significant barriers to achieving a successful transition into adulthood. Our basic income pilot is an exciting project to deliver financial stability for a generation of young people that need it most. Support will also be offered that is designed to build up their confidence to negotiate the world outside of care. This extra support will include, for instance, financial wellbeing training and signposting to all available support.” All young people leaving care who turn 18 during a 12 month period, across every local authority area in Wales, will be offered the chance to take part in the pilot. The pilot will run for a minimum of three years with each person receiving a basic income payment of £1600 a month for a duration of 24 months from the month after their 18th birthday. Almost half of the Welsh parliament signed a pledge calling for UBI to be trialled in the run up to last year’s elections.

2/16/2022,"The conservative writer and humorist PJ O’Rourke, whose acerbic wit and writings often won admiration on both sides of America’s political divide, has died, media reports and colleagues said. He was 74 years old. Peter Sagal, O’Rourke’s colleague and host of the NPR radio show Wait Wait… Don’t Tell Me!, said on Twitter: “I’m afraid it’s true. Our panelist and my dear friend PJ O’Rourke has passed away.”  The CNN host Jake Tapper reported that O’Rourke had died of cancer. “Our dear friend and cherished Grove Atlantic author P.J O’Rourke passed away this morning from complications of lung cancer,” Tapper quoted O’Rourke’s publisher as saying. O’Rourke was one of the most quoted writers in America, dissecting US politics and culture with a withering disdain and a powerful line in put-downs – often laced with a warm, self-deprecating humanity. He held a variety of roles that showcased his writing, commentary and reportage – and most importantly his humor. They included stints as editor in chief of National Lampoon and Rolling Stone’s foreign affairs desk chief. His targets featured government and politicians in works like Parliament of Whores and Don’t Vote: It Just Encourages the Bastards but also ranged towards foreign reporting such as his war correspondent book Holidays in Hell. Nearly all his work was laced with tales from his own life and joy of hard partying, at least in his early writing. Though he was notably – and briefly – a hippy in the late 196os and early 1970s O’Rourke found his home on the right of the political spectrum, though far from the conservative social values that many in the Republican party embraced. One of his best-known works was titled Republican Party Reptile: The Confessions, Adventures, Essays and Outrages of PJ O’Rourke. Though O’Rourke often reserved his sharpest barbs for the left and Democrats, he admitted that in 2016’s election he would be supporting Hillary Clinton over the Republican nominee, Donald Trump. “She’s wrong about absolutely everything, but she’s wrong within normal parameters,” he said. O’Rourke was from Toledo, Ohio, born the son of a car salesman. He went to university in Ohio and, later, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He was married twice, latterly moving to New Hampshire with his second spouse, Tina Mallon, with whom he had three children. Numerous friends and former colleagues paid tribute to him. “PJ was special. When he came by the office, the fun and wit went up a notch, sparks were in the air, and we all felt a certain joie de vivre. I cherish the memories,” wrote the conservative writer Bill Kristol of a shared time at the rightwing the Weekly Standard. “PJ O’Rourke was one of the nicest writers I ever had the pleasure of meeting and drinking and (very rarely) corresponding with.

2/16/2022,"The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack issued subpoenas on Tuesday to top Trump campaign and Republican officials involved in the scheme to send false electors for Donald Trump in states won by Joe Biden, as it examines the coordination behind the effort. The panel sent subpoenas to six individuals who were involved in a brazen attempt to meet and submit fake electoral college certificates that formed the backbone of a Trump-connected scheme to have Congress return the former president to office.  Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the select committee, suggested in a statement that the subpoenas aimed to compel cooperation from the key actors about whether the Trump White House oversaw the effort to have so-called alternate electors participate in the scheme. “We’re seeking records and testimony from former campaign officials and other individuals in various states who we believe have relevant information about the planning and implementation of those plans,” Thompson said. The second set of subpoenas to people involved in the scheme comes weeks after the deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, confirmed that the justice department had opened its own investigation into the matter, raising the stakes for the fake electors and the Trump White House. The select committee subpoenaed two senior Trump campaign officials: Michael Roman and Gary Michael Brown, who served, respectively, as the director and deputy director for election day operations for the Trump 2020 re-election campaign. Both Trump campaign officials – Roman and Brown – participated in efforts to promote allegations of fraud in the November 2020 election and encourage state legislators to appoint false “alternate” slates of electors, Thompson said. In separate subpoena letters, Thompson said the panel had communications showing the pair coordinated a pressure campaign urging Republican members of state legislatures to send Trump slates, and oversaw Trump campaign staffers involved in the effort. The select committee also targeted four state Republican allies of Trump: the chair of the Arizona Republican party Kelli Ward, former Michigan Republican party chair Laura Cox, Pennsylvania state senator Douglas Mastriano, and Arizona house member Mark Finchem. Ward signed a fake election certificate, Cox was a witness to the Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani pressuring states to disregard Biden’s win in Michigan, Mastriano had knowledge of the fake electors scheme, and Finchem communicated with organizers of the Save America rally on 6 January, Thompson said. Trump’s plan to return himself to office rested on two elements: the existence, or possible existence, of alternate slates, that then-vice president Mike Pence could use to declare that “dueling slates” meant he was unable to certify those states in favor of Biden. The effort to subvert the results of the 2020 election at the joint session of Congress on 6 January fell apart after Pence refused to abuse his ceremonial role to certify the results, and it was clear the “alternate slates” were not legitimate certificates. The panel is seeking to examine whether the effort was coordinated by the Trump White House and whether it amounted to a crime, according to a source close to the investigation.
