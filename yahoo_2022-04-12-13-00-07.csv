4/12/2022,"The Ukrainian region of Bucha has been host to some of the war's worst atrocities. Sexual violence against women is ""the new weapon"" used by Russian troops, a Ukrainian official said. It's currently ""impossible"" to gauge how widespread sexual abuse is, the official added. After Russian troops backed out of Kyiv and the surrounding areas, the world is learning about the damage left behind in the suburb of Bucha, just over an hour's drive to Ukraine's capital, which had been under Russian control. Bucha has been the scene of some of the war's worst atrocities — largely including sexual violence against the region's civilian women. A woman clothed only in a fur coat was found with a bullet to the head inside of the basement of a pillaged home, the home's owner told The New York Times. Volodymyr Shepitko, 66, told the publication his home was overtaken by Russian troops. The woman's body was found near several condom wrappers and a single used one, the outlet reported. The Ukrainian ombudswoman for human rights, Lyudmyla Denisova, previously called abuse by Russian soldiers their ""new weapon."" She told BBC that a group of ""About 25 girls and women aged 14 to 24 were systematically raped during the occupation in the basement of one house in Bucha."" ""Russian soldiers told them they would rape them to the point where they wouldn't want sexual contact with any man, to prevent them from having Ukrainian children,"" she said, adding that nine of them wound up pregnant. Denisova told the outlet that it's currently ""impossible"" to gauge how widespread the sexual violence against women is in the region because not everyone is willing to speak up about it. ""The majority of them currently call for psychological support, so we cannot record those as crimes unless they give us their testimony,"" she added.

4/12/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has cancelled the purchase of about 40 million Astrazeneca Plc COVID-19 vaccine doses it agreed to buy last year, a health ministry official said in parliament on Monday. The contract allowed the government to cancel a portion of the supply if it was unneeded, the official said in response to lawmakers' questioning. Japan had originally agreed to buy 120 million of the shots, with the bulk made domestically by Daiichi Sankyo Co. and other local partners. About Astrazeneca 200,000 doses have been supplied to local governments in Japan, while 63 million doses have donated overseas, the official added. Japan has predominantly relied on the mRNA-type vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc for its COVID inoculations and boosters so far.

4/12/2022,"A new class action lawsuit filed by an investor in Trumpworld’s favorite “Let’s Go Brandon” meme coin claims that some of the token’s key players orchestrated a pump-and-dump scheme. The news marks the latest bit of drama that has plagued the coin since its inception last year and which has persisted since the cryptocurrency relaunched in February. A number of former President Donald Trump’s most loyal fans bought into the crypto hype, only to see the value of their investments plummet. Attorneys for the plaintiff, an investor in the coin named Eric De Ford, claimed that the token’s executives and insiders “made false or misleading statements” and “disguised their control over the [c]ompany.” Ultimately, the 79-page suit filed in Florida alleges, those insiders “cynically marketed the LGB Tokens to investors so that they could sell off their portion…for a profit,” even as the selloff caused the value of the coin to drop precipitously for the remaining crypto holders. The defendants included the Trumpy hedge funder James Koutoulas, NASCAR, and conservative media personalities Candace Owens and David Harris Jr., among others. Squabbling ‘Let’s Go Brandon’ Crypto Team Tries to Relaunch Koutoulas fired back at the allegations in text messages to The Daily Beast. “The plaintiff’s behavior frankly, is disturbing—almost like a stalker,” he wrote. Koutoulas sent a document that showed apparent email exchanges between De Ford and other individuals affiliated with the coin in February, in which De Ford said he was “inspired by what this token can do for our nation” and offered to help market the coin for free. Evidently his perspective on the coin’s management quickly changed. “One moment he’s praising our vision and offering to promote the coin, now suddenly, he’s filed a bizarre conspiracy claim,” Koutoulas said. In a statement, a lawyer representing the plaintiff, Aaron Zigler, sought to rebut Koutoulas’ version of events. “We are disappointed to learn that Mr. Koutoulas would resort to such a misleading characterization of the facts in this case in what appears to be a desperate attempt to continue to prop-up the value of the token and to scare away other defrauded investors from seeking their day in court,” he wrote. “That a litigant and lawyer like Mr. Koutoulas would expose himself to potential defamation claims and bar discipline in response to being named in a thoroughly researched and well-founded federal lawsuit is consistent with the same poor judgment alleged in the Complaint,” he added. Some of Trumpland’s most vocal influencers got behind the coin and subsequently were named in the class action suit, including Owens and Harris. Donald Trump Jr.—who has hawked the coin publicly—wasn’t named, however. ‘Let’s Go Brandon’ Crypto Coin Turns Into Total Dumpster Fire “This #ad has one purpose and it’s to let you know that free speech is about to make a major comeback. Stay tuned @letsgo,” Trump. Jr. wrote in an April 7 tweet that garnered over 30,000 likes. A source close to Trump Jr. with direct knowledge told The Daily Beast that Trump Jr. hasn’t entered into any agreement with the Let’s Go Brandon coin. Owens billed the lawsuit as a frivolous filing that “borders on hilarity.” “For starters, I was not paid a single red cent ‘to promote’ the LGB coin,” she told The Daily Beast. “Beyond that, I myself lost money on the coin which removes me unequivocally from any notion of an inside ‘pump and dump’ scheme.” Harris did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment. The original Let’s Go Brandon coin was inspired by a televised mishap at a NASCAR race last year. After driver Brandon Brown won the event, the crowd loudly chanted “F*ck Joe Biden,” which an NBC reporter inaccurately relayed as “Let’s Go Brandon.” The slogan soon caught on as a pro-Trump rallying cry and a critique of what his fans perceived as media bias. For a time, it looked like the cryptocurrency would become an official sponsor of Brown’s NASCAR team, but the deal was ultimately kaboshed. That caused the token’s price to fall, and the class action lawsuit claims that insiders made things worse by selling their stakes. (The suit further alleges that NASCAR didn’t adequately distance itself from the crypto token; the company did not respond to a request for comment as of publication time.) By February, the coin’s market value had fallen more than 99 percent from its peak—leading a number of its key players to hash out a plan to rebrand and relaunch. The aggressive marketing strategy hasn’t slowed. Last month, when former President Trump appeared on Harris’ podcast, he was presented with 500 billion of the new Let’s Go tokens by Koutoulas. The value of those coins then stood at a measly $45,000; prices have stayed roughly flat over the past 30 days.
