3/27/2022,"Vladimir Putin wants to split Ukraine into two, emulating the post-war division between North and South Korea, the invaded country’s military intelligence chief has said. Gen Kyrylo Budanov, who predicted Russia’s invasion as far back as November, said Moscow had been unable to “swallow” the country but faced guerrilla warfare should it seek to split it. His warning came as Leonid Pasechnik, the leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic in the contested Donbas region in the east, said he may stage a referendum on his territory becoming part of Russia. “I think that in the near future a referendum will be held on the territory of the republic, during which the people will… … express their opinion on joining the Russian Federation,” Pasechnik said. Russia’s president recognised the two such eastern self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk shortly before the start of the war. He launched his so-called “special military operation” on 24 February, claiming that he was acting in defence of its people. Budanov said he believed that Putin had wanted to take over the whole of Ukraine but has changed his plan since failing to take its capital, Kyiv, and overthrow Volodomyr Zelenskiy’s government in the early days of the war. Saturday’s missile attacks on Lviv, in the west of Ukraine close to the Polish border, are being seen as a message of defiance to the US president, Joe Biden, who was speaking in neighbouring Poland, and an attempt to hit Ukrainian fuel and military hardware supplies. The two targets of the attacks, after which black smoke billowed across Lviv’s historic horizon of steeples and domed cathedral, were a fuel depot and a factory used for repairing tanks, anti-aircraft systems and radar stations. Both were close to apartment blocks and only a mile from the Unesco world heritage protected city centre. One witness, Dmitry Leonov, 36, an IT worker, said the ground shook and people had been thrown to the ground by the force of the blasts at the tank factory. The windows of a local school were said to have been smashed by the force. The Lviv emergency services chief, Khrystyna Avdyeyeva, said the fire at the fuel depot had been finally put out after 13 hours at 6.49am on Sunday. “The boys have been through hell,” she said. Of those responsible for launching the missiles, which came from Crimea, up to 1,000 miles away, she said: “Let them burn in the same hell. But our heroes will not be there, so nobody will survive.” Budanov said he was convinced the Russian president was seeking to split Ukraine despite the attack in the west, only the third major assault there since the war began. He said: “Putin is already changing the main operational directions – towards the south and the east. There is reason to believe that he is considering a “Korean scenario” for Ukraine. “That is trying to impose a dividing line between the unoccupied and occupied regions of our country. In fact, it is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine. After all, he is definitely not able to swallow the entire country.” Russia has been bogged down in the besieged port city of Mariupol in its attempts to create a land corridor between Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, and the Donbas region. Budanov said he did not believe Mariupol would fall soon and that Russian troops would face guerrilla tactics even if it did manage to defeat the experienced Azov battalion in the flattened city. He said: “The occupiers will try to unite the occupied territories into a single quasi-state entity, which will oppose independent Ukraine. We are already seeing attempts to create ‘parallel’ authorities in the occupied territories and force people to give up the hryvnia [Ukraine’s national currency]. “They may want to bargain at the international level. However, the resistance and protests of our citizens on the occupied territories, counter-attacks by the armed forces and gradual liberation – significantly complicate the implementation of enemy’s plans. “In addition, the season of total Ukrainian guerrilla safari will soon begin. Then there will be one relevant scenario left for the Russians – how to survive.” Oleksii Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskiy, echoed the intelligence chief’s analysis. “Within a week or two, Russia will withdraw troops from Kyiv and Kharkiv regions and send them to Donbas”, he said. “They realised that they will not be able to take over the big cities, they will announce the completion of the first phase of the ‘special operation’ and the beginning of the second – the ‘liberation of Donbas’.” Arestovych continued: “They now have three tasks: to surround our troops in Donbas, to completely occupy Mariupol and the south. If they lose Kherson [a city west of Mariupol], their entire Mariupol occupation will collapse. And that’s all. There will be no capture of Kyiv, Kharkiv or Odesa.” Elsewhere, in Kharkiv the authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, including on a nuclear research facility. In Kyiv, the authorities warned that Russians were increasingly disguising themselves as civilians to engage in sabotage.",News/World news,"Putin wants ‘Korean scenario’ for Ukraine, says intelligence chief",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/putin-wants-korean-scenario-for-ukraine-says-intelligence-chief
3/27/2022,"Where did it all go wrong for Rishi Sunak? The most popular chancellor in four decades now pilloried for a spring statement which failed to meet the challenge of the worst hit to living standards since the Suez crisis. Attacked for promising tax cuts while stealthily driving up the tax burden to the highest level since Clement Attlee was prime minister in the late 1940s. Criticised for putting Instagram moments ahead of the serious task at hand, here was an out-of-touch ivory tower politician who would allow living costs to rise faster than pensions and benefits. It was the mini-budget to please no one. In an earlier time the story would have been very different. Conservative chancellors promising tax cuts would normally enjoy support from their own party. Prioritising the public finances over benefit handouts should be a surefire winner for any would-be Tory leadership contender. In the arid desert of support for Sunak, it was noticeable that George Osborne was among the few politicians willing to offer him praise, gushing that the Conservatives had been given back a “long-term economic plan” based on controlling spending, reducing the deficit and cutting taxes. The trouble is the times have changed. Now is not the moment for an Osborne reboot of “fixing the roof while the sun is shining”. In case the chancellor hadn’t noticed, the economic weather has turned – with more than a million people expected to be pushed into absolute poverty. A decade of austerity cuts to public services has swung public opinion behind more state intervention, not less, with the response to Covid highlighting how much can be done during extreme shocks to the economy. That Sunak’s spring statement fell so badly flat highlights three things: how much has changed since Osborne was chancellor, how badly Sunak has judged the cost of living crisis and how poorly equipped the neoliberal toolbox is to deal with the big challenges facing the British economy. A decade earlier the Conservatives had been on a branding exercise to claim the mantle of the workers’ party, taking aim at benefit scroungers to boost employment and discourage a life on handouts. Sunak’s approach is in that vein – promoting work as the best engine to lift people out of poverty. Having cut benefits by £20 per week last October despite all the warnings, he was hardly going to turn back now. However, there are serious problems with this approach when hard work isn’t making life any easier while living costs soar, and after a decade of economic mismanagement from the party of government. The Resolution Foundation estimates average pay levels are on course to be just £18 per week higher in 2027 than they were in 2008, after adjusting for inflation. The upwards path for wages achieved in the years before the financial crisis has stalled in the decade since. Far from levelling up or building back better, typical household incomes are forecast to fall by 2% between Boris Johnson’s election landslide in 2019 and 2025, making his the worst parliament on record for living standards. The Tory advert for the world of work could hardly be worse. Failure to take action on workers’ rights has led to the scandal of 800 seafarers being fired without notice at P&O Ferries. Precariousness of employment and low pay are endemic. Refusing to boost benefits ignores that millions of the lowest-paid workers are forced to rely on them. Official figures show as many as 40% out of the 5.6 million universal credit claimants are in work. While the government is raising the minimum wage by 6.6% to £9.50 an hour this April, benefit cuts made last autumn and tax rises this spring mean many on low-pay will still be worse off. Most people living in poverty are either in work or live in a working household, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. As many as one in eight workers are now in poverty – about 4 million people. That is a rise of about 1.5 million from the late 1990s when one in 11 people in poverty had a job. While research suggests poverty rates fall sharply when people move into work, it’s clear that even sustained employment does not eliminate a life below the breadline in 21st century Britain. An action plan to improve the outcomes of the economy for workers is needed. This requires a twin track approach. Firstly, additional help for the poorest with surging energy bills and the rising cost of a weekly shop. It took Boris Johnson less than 24 hours from the spring statement to admit this might be necessary. Secondly, longer term measures to get the economy moving and provide access to well-paid, secure employment. This should start with an employment bill to ban exploitative fire and rehire practices of the type used by bosses at P&O, as well as ending zero-hours contracts. A decade ago the public did not believe Labour when the party insisted the best way to cut the deficit was to boost the economy with a Keynesian burst of public investment. Today, the shoe is firmly on the other foot. The Tory argument that the state must step aside and let businesses and workers find their own way through the latest economic shocks falls entirely flat.",News/Politics,Sunak learns hard way UK public don’t want an Osborne reboot,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/27/rishi-sunak-learns-hard-way-uk-public-dont-want-osborne-reboot
3/27/2022,"Two goals from the head of lifelong fan Alessia Russo helped Manchester United to come from behind to earn a 3-1 win over Everton in front of a club record crowd of 20,241 at Old Trafford for a Women’s Super League match. Russo’s first-half header cancelled out Claire Emslie’s well-taken strike in the fourth minute. United took the lead from the spot in the second half through the captain and fellow-lifelong United fan Katie Zelem before Russo added her second late on. It was one year to the day since United’s women’s team had first stepped out on to the pitch at Old Trafford. That was in the midst of the pandemic. One year on, and hours before kick-off, fans buzzed around the Old Trafford perimeter with anticipation. On the 8.20am train from London Euston United shirts were present in every carriage. From the faces of the players looming large on banners on the ground’s exterior to the tickets given away at local schools, the club pushed for a turnout that would eclipse the team’s record league crowd of 3,797 at Leigh Sports Village and it did not disappoint. The party mood would be swiftly quelled though. The former Manchester City forward Emslie was set free on the right by Kenza Dali and she coolly slotted past the United goalkeeper, Mary Earps, and in at the far post. To say the away team taking the lead was a surprise would be an understatement. The Blues had scored just 14 goals and had won just five times in 17 league games prior to kick-off. Meanwhile, United are battling for a place in the Champions League, for the first time, with derby rivals Manchester City, who sit in fourth. City are three points behind the Red Devils, but have a game in hand after the postponement of Sunday’s match with Birmingham due to a Covid outbreak in the Midlands team. Emslie’s goal was not in the script. Many teams have hosted their biggest WSL or derby rivals in their main stadium but United’s decision to host the inconsistent and flustered Everton at Old Trafford should have been as close to a sure three points as you can get. United searched for the reply but the visiting team dropped into a solid back five that dealt well with the threat and United were wasteful. In the ninth minute Zelem scooped an effort over the bar after it was worked to her from the right and moments later Russo robbed the centre-back Gabby George, but her shot was straight into the arms of a relieved Sandy MacIver. In the 35th minute United had the leveller that would breathe life into a flattening match. The right-back, Ona Batlle, sent a cross in and Russo, leaning back, flicked a looping header over an at-sea MacIver. Shortly after Ella Toone somewhat inexplicably skied a shot over the bar from the edge of the six-yard box, the ball perhaps not bouncing too kindly for her, United took the lead. Lucy Graham, on at half-time in place of Nathalie Björn, lost the ball to Thomas and then clipped the forward’s feet as she tried to recover, conceding a penalty. Zelem stepped up and blasted her spot-kick into the roof of the net. They should have been two up less than 10 minutes later as Thomas bundled in the rebound after MacIver did well to keep out Maria Thorisdóttir’s effort, but she was ruled offside despite Graham playing her on by a significant margin. United eventually extended their lead late on, with Russo heading in again, this time from a Zelem corner, and the tensions eased and party atmosphere resumed as the clocked ticked down on a historic outing.",Sport/Football,Russo double helps Manchester United beat Everton in WSL at Old Trafford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/27/russo-double-helps-manchester-united-beat-everton-in-wsl-at-old-trafford
3/27/2022,"As a leading adviser on disaster recovery, Lucy Easthope has often witnessed the effects of “nuclear incidents, chemical attacks, pandemics, food shortages, fuel shortages, trains and plane crashes, volcanoes and tsunamis”. Yet when she arrives at another scene of carnage, she tells us, she is “always struck by how fine the line between catastrophe and the rest of the world can be”. Her enthralling new book draws back the curtain on the crucial but largely hidden work of planning for emergencies, intervening when the worst happens – and then trying to bring communities back from the brink. Easthope describes herself as “a child of the indomitable city of Liverpool”. She was deeply affected by the Hillsborough disaster while at school and spent her summer holidays on work experience assignments with her uncle and aunt, both coroners in northern towns. She studied law at university, worked as a researcher on a television drama about Bloody Sunday in Northern Ireland and then took a master’s degree in disaster management. Since she has “never been afraid of the dead”, Easthope took a job with a disaster management company called Kenyon, which in 2002 was asked by the Ministry of Defence to support the repatriation of any personnel killed during the invasion of Iraq (a sensitive piece of pre-planning at a time when Stop the War marches were still under way). She went on to take an academic position and a job in risk management at Cambridge city council before setting up her own consultancy to advise businesses and government departments. “The work of UK disaster response,” she explains, involves helping to “run investigations, build mortuaries and oversee identification, burials, personal effects and repatriations”, though she has also developed her own specialist niche “in addressing what comes later still... I try to take the affected community a step further and ask what they need in order to face a post-disaster future with assurance”. On many occasions, Easthope reports, she has “check[ed] into a cheap B&B with my own suitcase as well as items of still-thawing luggage of several dead men”. She has sifted through the poignant personal effects left behind by tragedies. (Among those recovered after the 7/7 terror attack in London were “Tupperware filled with salad” and “the thick paper wodge of a near-to-submission PhD thesis, still being annotated up until the point that the bomb exploded”.) Elsewhere, Easthope recalls the “viewing rooms” for corpses that “would smell strongly of instant coffee”, since “the embalmer’s facial reconstruction kit was often overwhelmingly biased towards white skin and I was appalled to see that well into the 2000s the way round this was to mix Nescafe granules into the mixture if the deceased was anything other than pink”. And speaking of smells, though there are apparently “some similar compounds in fresh-cut grass, semen, particular vegetables, animal meat and menstrual blood”, nothing quite matches the “assault on your nasal passages” of decomposing bodies. Not only has the experience “put [Easthope] off mushrooms for life”, but the particular cleaning fluid used in mortuaries “has a canny, fateful habit of turning up at the wrong moment”, such as in “the toilets of a concert venue on an anniversary night out”. Such graphic and disturbing details have their own, rather ghoulish fascination. But they also matter deeply, as Easthope sees it, precisely because we need to think about the ways in which “the treatment of the disaster dead [can] amplify the suffering of families”. Pathologists would sometimes sever the hands of the dead and even “deglove” the outer layer of skin so they can pull this over their own hands to make fingerprinting easier. One police force, we read, went through an unfortunate phase of returning personal effects in a box wrapped in “recycled paper that had been pulped with wild flowers. The ‘artisan’ result was quietly scrapped when families complained that they had been shocked by the flecked paper, thinking that the little imperfections were bits of blood or ash.” Over the course of her career, and particularly since the 2012 London Olympics, Easthope believes there has been “a slow rot” in British disaster planning, with the focus shifting from a “genuine interest in public perception and resilience in the face of emergencies to ‘optics’. Instead of being asked about what we thought survivors might need in any given scenario or how a public health message might be received, we were now being asked to judge whether we thought the prime minister would be able to weather the storm or have to resign.” Despite a number of pre-Covid planning exercises, “the guidance coming out of central government on how to ready for the dead of pandemic... was confined to a few pages in a PDF concluded by a bizarre diagram for constructing temporary shelving. It looked like the sort of thing that would accompany a flimsy flat-packed wardrobe.” Much of this is somewhat dispiriting, but When the Dust Settles also includes a striking example of how one community managed to achieve a form of closure after disaster. As part of the mourning process, most relatives want body parts to be identified and returned to them. But it is also important for some sort of end point to be fixed. After a terrible fire at Lac-Mégantic in Canada in 2013, notes Easthope, the coroners reflected on “the stories from [post-9/11] New York, of the sometimes many funerals for the same person as more remains were identified, and were worried about putting their community through that”. Plans for recovery and regeneration would never be effective, it was decided, if “every lorryload of clay was still being sifted in a central location”. So clear timeframes were created and, as a result, some kind of normality, and even dancing in an “identically rebuilt” cafe, has now returned to the town, precisely because the bereaved “have held their funeral and do not wait for a knock at the door to say another minute sample has been found”. Though laced with bleak humour, this vivid and humane book forces readers to look into some exceptionally dark places. Yet it also makes a powerful case for facing up to the worst head on, if we ever want to find hope and even a measure of healing after disaster.

3/27/2022,"Being male, unable to look beyond your mobile phone and unfamiliar with the avalanche forecast: these are critical risk factors on Scotland’s mountains, according to the country’s foremost female climbing expert. Heather Morning, who took up her post as chief instructor at Glenmore Lodge, Scotland’s national outdoor training centre, earlier this month, is urging visitors to “think winter” this springtime, as Police Scotland revealed on Friday that mountain rescues are up 40% in recent weeks, with climbers misreading treacherous conditions on the peaks. Seven people have died on the hills this month alone. Morning, who is based in Aviemore, 50 miles north-east of Fort William, said: “Into March, we get longer daylight hours, and down in the glen here it very much feels like summer. People aren’t switched on to the fact they might still need an ice axe and crampons up high.” With snow still falling in the Cairngorms, the warmer days and frosty nights combine to make conditions even more dangerous, with melt water turning to hard ice. “Inevitably, we see fatalities of people stepping on old hard snow, taking flight and rattling off into rocks or off cliffs. Loss of life is complex, but there are definitely some trends. Virtually all fatalities on the Scottish mountains are men. Men over 60 are the demographic that get into difficulties”. In her previous role as mountain safety adviser at Mountaineering Scotland, Morning analysed data covering a seven-year period up to the start of 2019 and discovered that women accounted for only 10 of the 114 fatalities. She said: “You make generalisations about male and female attributes with regard to risk taking and obviously it doesn’t reflect everybody, but from the many years I’ve spent training people, guys tend to overestimate their ability and give things a go, and don’t think that they need formal skills training, whereas ladies tend to swing way the other way.” Women, in Morning’s experience, have far less confidence in their own abilities and are more willing to attend, for example, a navigation course, “which some people think is irrelevant, when it is the absolute cornerstone of safety in the mountains”. She estimates that about 25% of mountain rescue incidents are the result of the “basic navigation error of putting people in the wrong place”. This male reluctance to learn about navigation overlaps with an assumption among many young people that all they require is an app. “As a younger person, your whole life is oriented around your mobile phone, so it seems very natural to take it into the mountain environment, while a map and compasses feel outdated,” she said. It is a further challenge to educate people who do not consider outdoor resources are relevant for them. “If we take the classic example of someone driving up from down south to climb Ben Nevis – I suspect that most people you meet on the main track up and never will have never even heard of the avalanche forecast”. Morning, who originally trained as a typist before being introduced to the Mountain Leader scheme while volunteering with a local youth club, believes that while women increasingly embrace outdoor adventure as much as men, this equality does not translate into those applying leadership qualifications. She advised Bonnie Boots, the Glasgow-based group that run women-only hillwalking sessions for women from ethnic backgrounds, and has further plans for a training programme to encourage more Bame women on to the leadership path. Her decades on the mountains have taught her never to make assumptions about an individual’s climbing capabilities, and this extends to dogs. She recalls her initial surprise when a “tiny little chihuahua” arrived with its owner to attend a navigation course she was running in the Ochills. “Oh my god, it was as hard as nails. The thing came off the hill filthy, having had a ball and it’s done something like 18 Munros. So never judge a book by its cover,” she said.",News/World news,"Being male and on your phone are biggest dangers on Scottish mountains, says expert",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/heather-morning-being-male-and-on-your-phone-are-biggest-dangers-on-scottish-mountains-says-expert
3/27/2022,"PPE the government bought for £122m from a company linked to the Tory peer Michelle Mone was purchased from the Chinese manufacturer for just £46m. The extraordinary profits apparently made by PPE Medpro and its partners in the supply chain are revealed in documents leaked to the Guardian, including contracts and an inspection report for sterile surgical gowns supplied by the firm. Despite being bought at the start of the pandemic and delivered in 2020, the 25m gowns were never used by the NHS after government officials rejected them following an inspection. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has for months been seeking to recover money from PPE Medpro through a mediation process. The firm claims it is entitled to keep the money, arguing that DHSC “agents” approved the gowns after inspection. PPE Medpro’s contract to supply 25m sterile surgical gowns was one of two awarded to the company after it was processed through a government “VIP lane” for politically connected companies. The company was first entered into the government’s high-priority lane after Mone contacted two cabinet ministers – Michael Gove and Theodore Agnew – in May 2020 to say that PPE could be sourced from “my team in Hong Kong”. Documents leaked to the Guardian shed light on the production of the gowns by a company in China, Wujiang Tutaike Textile and Finishing Co Ltd, as well as the apparent cost price paid. Two contracts entered into by PPE Medpro’s supply chain intermediaries with the Wujiang company suggest it supplied all 25m gowns. The total price paid was $60.35m, which at the time equated to approximately £46m. That suggests that PPE Medpro and three intermediary companies shared as much as £76m in profits – perhaps less shipping and other logistics costs. A spokesperson for PPE Medpro argued the company saved the government money, given the prices it was paying for PPE at the time. “The supply chain was significant, involving the sourcing team, manufacturers, sterilisation plants, packaging, quality assurance teams, logistics, finance and much more,” they said. “This global team of people and companies worked around the clock 24/7 to deliver PPE to the frontline to save lives.” In January, the Guardian revealed that a tranche of leaked files appear to show both Mone and her husband, the Isle of Man financier Douglas Barrowman, were secretly involved in PPE Medpro’s business. The leak included WhatsApp messages from June 2020 in which Mone, texting from a private jet, appears to be discussing the required sizes of the gowns, and details regarding the DHSC’s purchase order or “PO” process. Lawyers representing Mone said the Guardian’s reporting was “grounded entirely on supposition and speculation and not based on accuracy”. They have repeatedly said she “was not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity”, had no “association” with the company and “never had any role or function” in the process by which contracts were awarded to the firm. Lawyers for Barrowman have also distanced him from PPE Medpro, but they have not denied that he benefited financially from the company’s business. The House of Lords commissioner for standards, Martin Jelley, is investigating whether Mone should have registered an interest in the company or whether she broke lobbying rules. Mone denies any rule-breaking and said: “I was asked to help at a time of national emergency.” Her lawyer said Mone would not answer questions about the gowns because “she has no involvement in the business”. A lawyer for PPE Medpro indicated that the company believes it is entitled to keep the money paid for the unused gowns, on the basis that it did fulfil the contract. They said: “The gowns were fully inspected by DHSC agents and only when they were satisfied that the contractual requirements had been met was payment sent to PPE Medpro. Payment was sent in full, clearly signifying complete satisfaction with the inspection process.” That inspection appears to have taken place in China, before the gowns were then transported to the UK. The Guardian has seen a leaked 20-page report of an internal supply chain inspection apparently carried out before that, in late August, at a factory in China’s Jiangsu province. It contains photos from inside the factory showing workers in casual clothes at sewing machines beside large piles of blue gowns, some trailing on the floor. The packing area is cramped and dimly lit. Photographs show that PPE Medpro’s gowns were packed into boxes at the factory with “sterile surgical gown” printed on the side in capital letters. Each gown was also wrapped in a clear plastic bag, with labels inserted inside. The labels in the inspection report bear PPE Medpro’s name and logo, technical specifications and instructions for use for the “sterile surgical gowns”. However, they do not display a certification number from a “notified body” such as the British Standards Institute (BSI) that would usually be expected to confirm surgical gowns were sterile in accordance with regulations. A lawyer for PPE Medpro did not dispute that no notified body had certified the gowns as sterile, but suggested that was not required because the gowns had been approved under “an equivalent technical solution” that meant that “the normal rules do not apply”. They suggested PPE Medpro was exempted from standard rules because its products were supplied under “very specifically and precisely agreed processes” and “in accordance with the annexures to the contract”. The Guardian has also been leaked what appears to be a draft label for PPE Medpro’s gowns that did include a BSI number. It is not known when the label was designed or by whom, and it does not appear to have been used as the final label. It looks largely identical to the final label seen in the leaked inspection report, except for the display of the number – 2797 – which is the official identification mark for BSI’s Netherlands office. A spokesperson for BSI said that it had never authorised PPE Medpro to use that certification number and had now reported the incident to the Netherlands regulator, the Health and Youth Care Inspectorate (IGJ): “We can confirm that PPE Medpro is not a client of BSI. We have reported the misuse of our notified body number to IGJ.” PPE Medpro did not respond directly to questions from the Guardian about when the label was designed, what its purpose was, whether it was ever shown to the DHSC, and why it apparently displayed an unauthorised BSI number. The firm’s lawyer said it denied any wrongdoing. The lawyer added that the DHSC had required all sterilisation documents prior to shipping, and the gowns were collected from a sterilisation plant it had approved. When the gowns were finally delivered to a PPE depot in Daventry, they were inspected by officials from both the DHSC and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The DHSC declined to explain why the gowns were rejected, while the mediation over its dispute with PPE Medpro is continuing. An MHRA spokesperson said: “They did not enter the supply chain after a range of checks by the MHRA and DHSC, which also showed that they were not double-wrapped.”",News/Politics,Government paid firm linked to Tory peer £122m for PPE bought for £46m ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/27/government-paid-firm-linked-to-tory-peer-122m-for-ppe-bought-for-46m
3/27/2022,"In Handel’s early 18th-century London, Hackney was a string of growing hamlets and a far cry from the composer’s stomping grounds of Mayfair and the West End. Handel would presumably have been bemused by the artfully curated facial hair (and breathtaking cost of his beloved coffee) in today’s East End clubbing headquarters. But the dank edginess of Village Underground’s converted warehouse space is also some distance from London Handel festival’s usual venues – and I’d guess this was the first ever LHF gig to usher in its audience with bottom-heavy Latin lift music on the sound system. The programme was a mix of Handel, other early music and contemporary alternative classical, all lightly amplified. The first set was for solo violin: Aisha Orazbayeva competed with passing motorbikes as she performed movements by Bach, Handel and Bassano – all gritty bow-catch and pointillistic counterpoint – bookended by two gently trippy pieces (looped melodies, harmonics, microtones) by Oliver Leith. Post-interval, soprano Anna Dennis joined string collective 12 Ensemble in their LHF debut. The easy beauty of Dennis’s singing in Handel’s Lascia Ch’io Pianga from Rinaldo is haunting and 12 Ensemble’s performance of Furie Terribili from the same opera is a showcase of ultra-tight, ultra-energetic string playing. The world premiere of Joss Campbell’s electronic treatment of Furie Terribili begins with a comic crash of thunder but is otherwise made of subtler stuff, Dennis’s recorded vocal line splintering amid live string harmonics, the piece’s sound-world shifting beguilingly between baroque and modern, acoustic and electronic. But much of the programme feels monochrome, with Dennis trapped in a bland musical world of melancholic vocalise. The idea, new LHF director Gregory Batsleer explained, is to take the festival into “spaces that wouldn’t normally hear Handel’s music”. But the reality was a concert that felt like any other – except that the audience stood for two hours and had plastic pint glasses in hand as they listened silently. As a guy standing next to me said to one of his friends during the interval, “I didn’t expect it to be this quiet – it feels like an actual concert”.

3/27/2022,"Labyrinthitis – an inner ear infection that causes dizziness and disorientation – is a good title for an album that’s dizzyingly, and sometimes pleasingly, weird. The Canadian indie rock veterans set out to make a techno record, with New Order, Cher and Trevor Horn also on their lockdown moodboard. It hasn’t quite worked out as planned, because Destroyer don’t instinctively grasp the simplicity at the heart of all great dance music. So instead we get fussy, endless layering and fragments of good ideas crushed into one another, topped with vocals that wobble from bizarre, mannered cabaret to slam poetry rap. What saves Labyrinthitis from being insufferable is singer Dan Bejar’s great facility for melody, and the gentle new wave pulse on songs such as All My Pretty Dresses. Eat the Wine, Drink the Bread could fit into a Caribou set, and the frankly bonkers, sprawling June is one of the best things Bejar has ever written. Unfortunately, there’s often this vast emotional chasm in his music, a feeling that nothing ever means anything, until the final two tracks, The States and The Last Song, which prove that he can write a lovely, affecting lyric after all.",Arts/Music,"Destroyer: Labyrinthitis review – wayward, dance-infused weirdness",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/27/destroyer-labyrinthitis-review-wayward-dance-infused-weirdness
3/27/2022,"At the end of what had been a largely flawless visit to Europe, during which he focused on the misery Vladimir Putin was imposing on Russia, Joe Biden closed his 27-minute speech on Saturday evening in Warsaw by conjuring up the image of a less popular US president – George W Bush – when he said: “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.” The US president has previously called Putin a killer, a pure thug, a war criminal and a butcher, but he had never advocated regime change, risking turning the war for the defence of Ukraine to a familiar one of American aggression. Biden can fairly say it was a personal expression of loathing, but during his election campaign he often said how much the words of an American president mattered and needed to be weighed. He would not be a Twitter loudmouth like the man he would later unseat, Donald Trump. It was clear from the way White House aides initially avoided any comment to the media that the final ad-libbed line had not been expected and needed clarification. It was not the first time that his off-script remarks have required official reworking. The press aides scrambled to undo the damage, interpreting Biden’s words not as a statement of intent, let alone presaging a plan of action, but instead a personal expression of moral revulsion. Later an official explained: “The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region. He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia or regime change.” But his remarks in their raw form hardly sat well with the UK government briefing on Saturday night that sanctions could be lifted if and when Putin left Ukraine. The British message was hardly that it would be business as usual – after all, Boris Johnson has said Putin must fail and be seen to fail – but the UK strategy set a potential end point to the sanctions. Biden’s remarks added another dimension. At the end of a month marked by a clear single war aim – the defence of the territorial integrity of Ukraine – the position had suddenly been blurred. It was a badly needed gift to Moscow, which has hardly had a stellar information war. Skilled at playing Washington as the imperialist bully, Moscow was quick to claim that Russians – not American leaders – chose their president. The remarks also leave the many mediators in this crisis – Turkey, Qatar and China – facing a harder task in convincing Putin there is any merit in turning back now. It is all or nothing. The US president has burned his bridges with Russia and there is no point in any negotiation, Moscow will argue, whether it believes this or not. Richard Haass, the chair of the Council on Foreign Relations, said: “The president just expanded US war aims, calling for regime change. However desirable it may be, it is not within our power to accomplish. Plus [it] runs [the] risk it will increase Putin’s inclination to see this as a fight to the finish, raising odds he will reject compromise, escalate, or both. “His remarks made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous. That is obvious. Less obvious is how to undo the damage, but I suggest his chief aides reach their counterparts and make clear that the US [is] prepared to deal with this Russian government. “It discourages Putin from any compromise, essentially: if you’ve got everything to lose, it frees him up. Why should he show any restraint? And it confirms his worst fears, which is that this is what the United States seeks. His ouster and systemic change.” What may be more worrying, especially if this war becomes prolonged, is the impact on the many powerful bystanders in this conflict. Western diplomacy pulled off a coup in March when Russia was left with only Eritrea, Belarus, North Korea and Syria coming to its side in a vote at the UN general assembly when 141 countries voted to condemn the invasion. But that left 35 countries, including powerful players such as India and China, not willing to condemn Russia at least through their vote. By no means all of the 141 countries have imposed sanctions, giving Roman Abramovich’s yachts many ports in a storm. Even now there is an assumption in the US and Europe to see this purely as Russia versus the rest, as opposed to Russia versus the west. There are many voices instinctively reluctant to defend America after 9/11. They are not prepared to see the conflict in terms of purely good versus evil, or to forget the past 30 years. The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, said: “It was mentioned that Mariupol is Europe’s Aleppo. Well, Aleppo was our Aleppo. The engagement of the global community – of the powers that could be affected – now and then was quite different.” Hina Rabbani Khar, the former foreign minister of Pakistan, said the value system the west deployed inside its border was different from that outside its borders. İbrahim Kalın, an experienced adviser to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, never mentioned Biden by name but urged caution, saying: “Every step we take, every move that we make in regard to bringing an end to this war is going to have an impact on the future security architecture. Russia is not going to go away as a country. “The power of this equilibrium that has shaped the international order ever since the end of the cold war over the last three decades has everything to do with this crisis. We have to create an environment in which every country, from Russia, Iran, the US, European countries, from Turkey to Gulf countries, feel safe enough in the international order that they do not resort to any kind of disruptive action. This is an unfair, unprovoked war, but whatever grievances Russia has had have to be understood – not justified, but understood. If everybody burns bridges with Russia there is no one talking to them at the end of the day.” At least the episode may have the salutary effect of forcing the west to think more clearly about what its endgame may be. A permanently weakened Russia, humiliated while attempting to capture Ukraine, its lucrative European energy market permanently thrown away by Putin’s crazed misreading of history, is hardly going to form a secure basis for him to remain in power as long as he intends. Ideally he is defeated in elections or is bundled out the door by the security services. But that is Russia’s business, not Biden’s.",News/US news,Biden’s Putin ad-lib should focus west on what its endgame should be,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/27/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-remarks-focus-west-on-endgame-analysis-ukraine
3/27/2022,"Leading Ukrainian politicians have accused the UN’s refugee agency of being unprepared for the war and withdrawing staff from hotspots while the International Committee of the Red Cross was said to be “impotent” in protecting refugees. Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, said the major humanitarian organisations had appeared “disoriented” by the conflict. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, claimed they had initially just watched “with concern over wine and coffee”. “Unfortunately, not a single foreign or international NGO was ready for the war in Ukraine to start despite the fact that six months ago everyone was talking about that and everyone was warning everyone that the war was going to start,” Sadovyi said. Sadovyi claimed the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had prioritised the safety of its own personnel over the lives of Ukrainians facing the worst of the Russian shelling. His deputy, Serhiy Kiral, said he had been surprised when officials in the UNHCR had described their own staff as “refugees” during conversations with him in the early stage of the conflict. About a million people have transited through Lviv, and the city’s population has risen by 200,000 since Vladimir Putin launched his so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine on 24 February. Kiral said: “In the first two weeks what they were actually telling us here [was] that they were like refugees themselves because they were busy with evacuating their staff personnel from Kyiv, looking for places for them to stay, making sure that they are safe and then psychologically [well]. You know, you don’t expect that from them”. He added: “As far as the major ones like [the] UN refugee agency, it took us a week probably to get through to the leadership just to find a person to talk to. “Then another week there was the head of the Ukraine country office here meeting the mayor and the deputy mayor talking about the needs and we have laid out what we need, like you know, humanitarian aid, foodstuffs … there were a lot of promises and commitments and then all the way up till today, nothing is happening.” A spokesperson for the UNHCR said it had moved staff from Mariupol, Severodonetsk and the capital, Kyiv, to safer areas of the country but that their overall staffing levels in the country had increased. He said: “No one was prepared for an emergency of this scale and speed. Even the Ukrainian government criticised international media for creating fear before the war, saying they did not expect an invasion … “The safety of our staff is of course a priority, but this has not led us to reduce our presence in Ukraine. Most of our staff based in Mariupol, Severodonetsk and Kyiv have been temporarily relocated to safer areas, such as Dnipro, Lviv and Vinnytsia, and at the same time, UNHCR has increased the number of staff in country over the past weeks by some 50 individuals (to 154 currently) and continues to recruit more staff to scale up our capacity to deliver a significant emergency programme.” A spokesperson for the ICRC said some staff with young families had left the country but that it had about 80 more people in the country than before. The ICRC has, however, faced heavy criticism for the repeated failure of agreements on humanitarian corridors out of cities such as Mariupol on the Azov Sea. Only one such corridor has been successfully organised, between the northern cities of Sumy to Lubny, leading Ukraine’s deputy prime minister to describe the organisation as “impotent” in an interview in Kyiv. Vereshchuk said: “We give them a task: Chernihiv or Kherson, the places where it’s difficult for us. Where we can’t negotiate with the Russians, we say just go there yourselves and evacuate people, take buses and go and get people, and they can’t do it.” A spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it could only “facilitate” the establishment of safe passage for refugees and that the warring parties needed to come to agreements. He said: “We have had discussions with the Ukrainian and Russian authorities for weeks now. This is up to them to agree on specific terms when it comes to humanitarian corridors or safe passage “They need to be very concrete on the terms of how, when and what needs to happen: agreeing on the road, the timing, for how long it will last, all these guarantees. And from there the ICRC can be requested to facilitate. “Unfortunately, it is up to them. We can only facilitate. We need to maintain our neutrality. This is the difficult role of the ICRC and at the moment it is why we face a lot of criticism coming from all sides”. The ICRC chair, Peter Maurer, visited Ukraine a week ago and was in Moscow on Thursday, meeting the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. “Neutral, impartial, [the ICRC] is mandated to speak with all sides of a conflict to advocate respect for the laws of war that protect civilian life,” he wrote on Twitter. However, photographs of apparent bonhomie at the meeting angered many Ukrainians.",News/World news,UN refugee agency accused over response to Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/un-refugee-agency-accused-over-response-to-ukraine-war

3/27/2022,"The government will issue much tougher guidelines on strip searches of children in schools in the wake of the Child Q scandal, the education secretary has said. Nadhim Zahawi said he found the case of the child – who was subjected to an intimate strip search by police officers in her school when she was 15 without parental consent and in the knowledge that she was menstruating – “hugely distressing”. He told the BBC’s Sunday Morning show that the search, which occurred after the child was wrongly suspected of possessing cannabis, was “appalling” and he had ordered a review of guidelines and policies around strip searches. “No child should have been exposed to that sort of trauma. It’s important that we take this very seriously,” he said. “The parents weren’t even contacted, which I find hugely distressing. “You don’t have to have a child to be shocked that a child is allowed to be strip-searched in an environment which is meant to be a protective environment – school is a protective environment for children – hence why I have asked my team to make sure that we review the policies.” Zahawi said he was looking at “putting out much tougher guidelines”. Schools are currently not required to inform parents before a search takes place, and only police officers may carry out intimate searches. On Friday the girl’s school said teachers were not aware at the time that a strip search was taking place, and that no staff members were present. A statement by the Hackney school’s governing board said that “while the school was not aware that a strip search was taking place, we wholly accept that the child should not have been left in the situation that she was”. A safeguarding report on the incident last week contained two recommendations, calling for the Department for Education to “review and revise” its 2018 guidance on “searching, screening and confiscation”, parts of which it said could “run the risk of promoting poor practice”. “As framed, its tone is largely about discipline and is likely to lead frontline staff down this path of practice,” the report said. Guidance – which “worryingly” contained outdated terminology such as “child pornography” – should be urgently updated and could be “strengthened by including much stronger reference to the primary need to safeguard children”, it said. There was also “little thought” given to the importance of contacting a family member. DfE guidance says schools should inform parents where illegal substances are found, but there “is no legal requirement to do so”. But the panel said this risked “schools not doing anything” and the guidance was “light on the inclusion of parental consent as an issue of importance”. “In Child Q’s case, she was the one who had to tell her mother she had been searched by the school and strip-searched by the police. In the opinion of the review, this ‘legally permissible practice’ is not good practice,” it said.",News/Society,Government to issue ‘much tougher guidelines’ on strip searches in schools,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/27/government-to-issue-much-tougher-guidelines-on-strip-searches-in-schools-child-q
