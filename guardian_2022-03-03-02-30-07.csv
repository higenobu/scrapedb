3/3/2022,"Changes to student loans in England announced by the government last week will hit lower-earning graduates even harder than first feared, costing them an extra £28,000, according to updated analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The IFS had previously calculated that lower- and middle-earning graduates would end up paying an additional £15,000-£19,000 towards their loan over their lifetime as a result of the changes, while the highest earners stood to benefit. A “crucial tweak” in supporting documents from the Department for Education prompted the IFS to revise its forecasts, as it spotted that the threshold for loan repayments would in future be tied to inflation rather than average earnings, increasing graduate repayments by lower earners significantly. The tweak will also apply to borrowers in the current system who began university between 2012 and 2022, according to the IFS, which described it as “a massive retrospective change in repayment conditions” that would hit lower- and middle-earning graduates hardest. Under the changes unveiled last week, for students starting university next year the repayment term for loans will be extended from 30 to 40 years after graduation. In addition, the income threshold at which loan repayments begin will be lowered from more than £27,000 to £25,000. The repayment threshold will be frozen at £25,000 until 2026-27 and then indexed to the inflation rate rather than average earnings, according to the IFS. Based on Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts, and because of changes to the way RPI is calculated, it means that from 2030 the repayment threshold will rise by about 1.7 percentage points less each year than it would otherwise have done. The IFS said the taxpayer would gain significantly. According to its latest calculations, net savings will be £2.3bn per cohort, more than double its original estimate of £1bn. Ben Waltmann, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: “Borrowers under the new student loan system who go on to have lower middling earnings can expect to pay roughly £9,000 more towards their student loans over their lifetimes than we thought last week. That’s an increase in the estimated impact of the announced changes by around half.” Save the Student said the analysis added yet more weight to the argument that the government’s plans were “at best poorly thought through, and at worst intentionally designed to benefit the highest earners and punish lower earners.” The Department for Education was contacted for comment. Last week it said the new measures still protected the lowest earners. Anyone earning less than £25,000 will not repay anything, while higher earners will pay back up to £58 more each month than they would have done under the current terms. On Wednesday thousands of students across the country took part in a “student strike”, with many travelling to central London to take part in a rally in support of university staff who have been striking over pay, pensions and working conditions, and to campaign for free education. Larissa Kennedy, the president of the National Union of Students, said: “The updates today from the IFS show just how stark these changes are, and just how these repayment terms will continue to impact graduates for the next 40 years of their lives. This is nothing more than an attack on opportunity.”",News/Education,Student loan changes hit lower earners harder than first thought – IFS,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/02/student-loan-changes-hit-lower-earners-harder-than-first-thought-ifs
3/3/2022,"Shoppers’ appetite for salmon is causing millions of tonnes of nutritious mackerel, sardines and anchovies to be wasted as fish feed, according to new research. Its authors say farming salmon is an inefficient way to produce nutritious seafood, calculating that half to 99% of minerals, vitamins and fatty acids in the wild-caught fish are not retained when fed to farmed Atlantic salmon. They say removing wild-caught fish from aquaculture feed production and diverting them to human consumption, and farming more carp and fewer salmon, could increase global seafood production by 6.1m tonnes, while leaving 3.7m tonnes of fish in the sea. Lia ní Aodha, research and policy officer on aquaculture at Feedback Global, who helped conduct the research, said: “Salmon farming is a good example of how deeply inefficient and inequitable the global food system is. “Much of the nutrient-rich fish used to feed farmed salmon is sourced from regions in the global south, where food insecurity is endemic, while the salmon is mainly sold to consumers in high-income markets in Europe, North America and parts of Asia.” Ní Aodha worked with researchers from the universities of Cambridge, Lancaster and Liverpool to investigate feed sources – and the nutrients transferred from them – in the Scottish salmon industry, Britain’s largest food export. They calculated that in a single year, 179,000 tonnes of salmon produced in Scottish aquaculture farms consumed fish meal and fish oil produced from 460,000 tonnes of wild-caught fish, 76% of which was edible. In their paper, published on the research forum Plos Sustainability and Transformation, they said: “Most edible wild-caught fish species in [fish meal and fish oil] have higher concentrations of key micronutrients than farmed salmon, and for some of these micronutrients, as little as 1% is retained in farmed salmon. “For calcium, iron, selenium and zinc, 1-28% is retained in farmed salmon. Scottish salmon is often marketed as high in omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA), yet omega-3 concentrations are similar in anchovy, herring, sardine and sprat, and only 49% and 39% of DHA available from wild fish are retained in farmed salmon.” In 2016, 15m tonnes of wild-caught fish were ground down into fish meal and fish oil, which was directed towards agriculture and aquaculture. According to figures cited in the paper, salmon fishing accounted for 60% of fish oil and 23% of fish meal directed to aquaculture, while producing only 4.5% of the sector’s global output. Authors still saw a role for aquaculture, but favoured carp and mussel farming over salmon. Dr James Robinson, of Lancaster university, who was involved in the study, said: “Aquaculture, including salmon farming, has an important role in meeting global food demand, but nutritious wild fish should be prioritised for local consumption rather than salmon feed, particularly if they are caught in food-insecure places. “Support for alternative feeds can help this transition, but we still need more data on the volumes and species used for fishmeal and fish oil, as this can show where salmon farming places additional pressure on fish stocks.” Hamish Macdonell, director of strategic engagement with Salmon Scotland, which represents salmon farmers, said: “Of the 5.5m tonnes of fish meal and fish oil produced annually, Scottish salmon farmers use less than 1%. The vast majority goes to other uses, including pet food.“So it is fundamentally wrong to pretend that the fishmeal industry would cease if not included in aquaculture feeds. The supply would simply shift to another, less sustainable use. If campaigners like the ones behind this report really want to do something to save forage fish, they should take a look at what we all feed our pets.”",News/Environment,"Wild fish stocks squandered to feed farmed salmon, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/02/wild-fish-stocks-squandered-to-feed-farmed-salmon-study-finds
3/3/2022,"Russia’s economy is expected to plunge into a deeper recession than the one caused by Covid-19 as a result of western sanctions and the country’s increasing isolation after invading Ukraine. Economists said measures imposed on Russian banks and companies by the US, EU, UK and their allies were having a severe impact on financial markets in Moscow and would inflict more damage on Russia’s wider economy over time. With tougher sanctions under consideration in western capitals as Vladimir Putin gathers troops closer to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after a week of conflict, analysts at Goldman Sachs said the investment bank had cut its forecast for Russian gross domestic product this year from 2% growth to a 7% decline. Russia’s economy was estimated to have grown by 4.5% last year after having shrunk by almost 3% in 2020, the worst year of the pandemic for the global economy. Analysts said the Ukraine war may have a limited impact on the global economy because trade links between Russia and the rest of the world were limited, with the country accounting for 1.5% of global GDP, and for 2.9% and 0.9% goods exports from the eurozone and Britain respectively. However, the invasion has triggered a surge in global energy prices – threatening to exacerbate a cost of living squeeze in several countries including the UK. The war comes as the global economy is still recovering from the pandemic. Oil prices rose on Wednesday to more than $111 a barrel, the highest level since 2014, as the prospect of disruption in supplies from Russia sent energy markets surging further. Russia is the world’s second biggest oil exporter and its largest in natural gas. Should recent increases in oil and gas prices be sustained, economists forecast higher inflation will hit households and businesses, and trigger a slowdown in economies across the world. Analysts at the consultancy Oxford Economics said the pressure on Russian financial markets would damage Russia’s GDP significantly, by as much as 6% relative to a pre-crisis forecast in a “plausible downside scenario”. The economic repercussions for Ukraine, as it suffers massive infrastructure damage and disruption from the Russian bombardment, is expected to be worse still, with evidence from previous war-hit countries suggesting a slump of up to 60% could be possible. Eurozone and UK GDP could be about 0.5 percentage points lower than previously expected owing to the impact from soaring gas prices. However, the analysts warned that a war lasting into 2023 with tougher sanctions from western governments and Russia retaliating by restricting gas supplies would cause a sharper fall of 7% in Russian GDP next year. Innes McFee, chief global economist at Oxford Economics, said the hit to jobs and growth was difficult to forecast given the rapid changes in the conflict. “This is not a worst-case scenario. More severe conflict scenarios are possible. But we regard this downside scenario as a relatively high probability for how the economy could deteriorate in the event of a more protracted conflict.”",News/World news,Russian economy could shrink by 7% as result of Ukraine sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/russia-economy-could-shrink-by-7-per-cent-as-result-of-ukraine-sanctions-war-recession-covid

3/3/2022,"Pressure is growing for designers to use their catwalk platform to show solidarity with Ukraine, and for luxury brands to cut off their Russian revenue streams.Balenciaga has become the first Paris fashion week brand to make a statement of solidarity with Ukraine. Ahead of a show scheduled for Sunday, the brand said it “would open our platforms in the next few days to report and relay the information around the situation in Ukraine”. It also made a donation to the World Food Programme. Kyiv has a strong contemporary fashion scene, and many design studios and fashion companies across Europe have Ukrainian team members. Strong feeling among those on the ground at fashion week, however, has not so far been reflected in action at boardroom level. Russian consumers account for about 3% of global luxury sales.TsUM Kyiv, a department store in the Ukrainian capital, has been closed since the Russian invasion began, with plans for its underground car park to be converted into a hospital. The store is leading calls for the fashion industry to show support by ceasing trade with Russia. “The fashion industry needs to stand up,” marketing director Marusya Koval told Vogue Business. “Stop trading – stop supplying Russia. Stop your relationships with Russia.” The cult Danish label Ganni and Hungarian brand Nanushka are among the few to have stopped selling to Russia. Ganni is “aligning with international sanctions and freezing all trade with Russia,” said its creative director, Ditte Reffstrup. Nanushka has ceased deliveries to customers in Russia, and outstanding orders with wholesale partners in the country will not be fulfilled. “We have respect for the Russian people and our partners,” said Nanushka’s CEO, Peter Baldaszti, who was watching a Milan fashion week show when news of the invasion of Ukraine broke. “We know this is not their decision, but it is impossible to do business with Russia based on our moral values.” He described it as “a significant financial decision” for the small label, adding “we are hoping for a quick solution so we can rebuild those relationships”. On Wednesday British online fashion retailer Asos it has suspended operations in Russia after the invasion. “Against the backdrop of the continuing war, Asos has decided that it is neither practical nor right to continue to trade in Russia,” an Asos spokesperson said.London-based magazine 1Granary, whose editor-in-chief, Olya Kuryshchuk, is Ukrainian, on Tuesday published an open letter asking “fashion businesses and their leaders to stand together with Ukraine and condemn Russia’s invasion”. The letter, whose early signatories include designer Christopher Kane, photographer Nick Knight, buyers for influential London boutiques Browns and Dover Street Market and editors from iD, Dazed and The Face magazine, asserts fashion’s power as “a trillion-dollar industry with gigantic cultural and even political influence. In times of crisis, it’s easy to dismiss that power as superfluous, frivolous, tone-deaf, hypocrite [sic] or non-essential … wherever you are today, don’t turn your back, don’t close your eyes.” The governing body of Paris fashion week has called for “solemnity” at this week’s shows, but insisted the event would go ahead as planned. “Given the present context, the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode encourages you to experience the shows of the coming days with solemnity, and in reflection of these dark hours,” said its president, Ralph Toledano, on Monday.Giorgio Armani is one of the few major designers to have addressed the war directly on the catwalk, holding his Milan show in silence. In a statement, the designer said the choice not to play music at Sunday’s event “was taken as a sign of respect towards the people involved in the unfolding tragedy in Ukraine”.

3/3/2022,"Eddie Jones has made eight changes to his 25-man squad and has dispensed with more than 200 England Test caps for next week’s Six Nations game against Ireland. The most noticeable absentee is George Ford who has seen his hold on the No 10 jersey wrenched from his grasp by Marcus Smith. Ford, who will be leaving Leicester Tigers at the end of the season for a move to Sale Sharks, had only recently found his way back in the England fold but played only 22 minutes against Scotland and Italy and was an unused substitute in the win over Wales. Elliot Daly is the other surprise omission in the backline given he has started two of England’s matches at 13 this campaign. In their place comes the uncapped London Irish wing Olli Hassell-Collins and Northampton’s George Furbank who can cover both 10 and 15 off the bench. The forward pack sees a raft of changes with an entirely new front row set. Luke-Cowan Dickie’s selection was unlikely following a knee injury he sustained against Wales. He’s been replaced by Newcastle’s Jamie Blamire. Props Joe Marler and Bevan Rodd also miss out. The uncapped duo of William Goodrick-Clarke and Alfie Barbeary will, if given the chance, provide evidence of England’s front-row reserves against a formidable Irish pack. At 30 years old and with 69 appearances for his country, Joe Launchbury could play in his first Test since December 2020. The Wasps second-rower injured his knee last April which ruled him out of contention for the British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa. But he’s registered 281 minutes from four Premiership starts for his club since January. His return to fitness and form means the 21-year-old Ollie Chessum misses out. Gloucester’s Lewis Ludlow is the final addition to the squad. He will serve as cover for the injured Tom Curry who missed the second half against Wales after failing a head injury assessment (HIA) at the interval. Without Curry, who captained his team in the tournament opener against Scotland, England’s potency at the breakdown is greatly diminished. Jones might then rethink persisting with Courtney Lawes on the flank of the scrum and might be tempted to pair him with Maro Itoje in the second row to plug the gap left by Curry. Judging by the experience he’s left behind in key positions, England’s coach has something new in mind for the must-win game next Saturday.",Sport/Sport,George Ford cut from England’s 25-man training squad before Ireland match,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/02/george-ford-cut-from-englands-25-man-training-squad-before-ireland-match
3/3/2022,"The price of carbon permits in Europe has crashed dramatically following Russian’s invasion of Ukraine, lowering the cost of emitting carbon for the EU’s most polluting companies. Permit prices, which are part of the European Union’s (EU) emissions trading scheme, were launched in 2005, and reached a high of €97 (£80) in early February, but have now slumped below €70. Prices were on course to drop to almost €60 on Wednesday afternoon, representing the biggest fall since 2014. The carbon price is the European Union’s (EU) flagship financial mechanism for curbing emissions, with companies, such as airlines, forced to buy the permits when they pollute. But investors appear to be pulling out of the market, with some experts saying they have been “spooked” by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The carbon price usually moves with energy prices but it has decoupled because of Vladimir Putin’s war. Ingvild Sorhus, a lead analyst for EU Carbon Analysis, said: “The escalating Ukraine crisis continued to spook investors’ sentiment and led to widespread liquidation of EUA positions. “Carbon prices are currently decoupling from the rest of energy complex, which rose on Russian supply concerns. Some participants perhaps suffered huge losses due to the spike in energy prices and were forced to sell EUA to avoid margin calls. “They are perhaps fretted [sic] about the impact of sanctions against Russia and also the economic fallout on the EU. Hence international investors maybe choose to offload their exposure to European assets.” She added that sharply rising commodities prices “could have hurt some industrial producers’ cash flows who then also sold off their surplus EUAs”, with the steep fall triggering more stop-losses and automatic selling. After the Cop26 climate summit last year, the EU carbon price surged to record levels and continued to do so in January as inflation and energy prices rose. The carbon price is an important EU policy aimed at curbing emissions across Europe’s entire energy and industrial sector. In theory, the more companies pay, the more effort they will put into cutting emissions. Meanwhile, Alessandro Vitelli, a freelance journalist specialising in climate and energy, said traders might have sold their permits to raise funds for natural gas positions. He also speculated Russian investors could be pulling their money out to avoid sanctions. “There has been a general liquidation of positions by investors over the last couple of trading sessions,” he said. “Some of this is due to commodity funds looking to release cash to move into other assets, but there is also some speculation that Russian investors are pulling their money out of funds to avoid sanctions that would freeze assets.” “The sharp rise in European natural gas prices – 38% today, after a 23% rise yesterday – also means that traders will need to post additional collateral to maintain futures positions. “They may well have sold carbon permits in order to raise cash to support those natural gas positions.” Other countries and trading blocs have carbon markets but set their own rules. For example, China has the largest but has lower prices and more relaxed rules.",News/Environment,EU carbon permit prices crash after Russian invasion of Ukraine ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/02/eu-carbon-permit-prices-crash-after-russian-invasion-of-ukraine
3/3/2022,"The United Nations has voted overwhelmingly for a resolution deploring Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces, in a global expression of outrage that highlighted Russia’s increasing isolation. In an emergency session of the UN’s general assembly, 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained and five voted against. The resolution, which was co-sponsored by 94 countries, said the UN “deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine”. It demanded that “the Russian Federation immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine” and “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces”. The resolution is not legally binding, but is an expression of the views of the UN membership, aimed at increasing pressure on Moscow and its ally, Belarus. On Friday, Russia was the sole vote against a similar resolution in the security council, but because Russia is one of the five powers with a veto, the resolution was not upheld, so Ukraine’s allies referred the matter to the general assembly. It is first time in 40 years, the security council has referred a crisis to the assembly and only the 11th time an emergency session of the UN general assembly has been called since 1950.

3/3/2022,"Trevor Noah did a deep dive into the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Tuesday evening, and praised the mettle of the Ukrainian resistance that has reportedly surprised and stymied the Russian military. “Everyone around the world has been inspired by the resistance that they’ve put up so far, and their ability to tell Russia to go fuck itself in so many different ways,” the Daily Show host explained. “Despite the overwhelming odds, you have to respect the fight, man!” he continued following several defiant, profanity-filled clips of Ukrainian civilians. “You have to respect the fight that the Ukrainian people are putting up. Civilians are grabbing shotguns. Farmers are towing tanks. Like, one thing we’re learning from this war is if you’re going to invade a country, maybe don’t pick the one where the grandmas don’t know how to turn their knitting into a firebomb. “But as brave as these people are, everyone is still terrified about the potential outcome of this war,” he added. “And that’s mainly because the madman who has launched it is really, really, really unpredictable.” Noah pointed to intelligence reports that Vladimir Putin is isolated both socially and geographically, that the only people talking to him are sycophants feeding his resentments, and that he grown increasingly hostile and frustrated. The reports mark a departure from Putin’s usual emotionless stance, what Noah described as a “weird combination of being super calm and super dangerous” and compared to a “cobra who took too many edibles”. “It makes complete sense that he’s lashing out now,” Noah remarked. “Remember this: Putin doesn’t know what it’s like to lose. He wins every re-election without campaigning. He wins judo matches against world champions. Now suddenly he’s having trouble beating a country that’s a fraction the size of his? No wonder he’s mad.” The Late Show with Stephen Colbert aired live following Joe Biden’s State of the Union address, which the host described as “a rollercoaster ride of rip-roaring reasonableness! “Right now, there is a dictator who thinks he can violently conquer a sovereign democracy, but Joe Biden beat him in the last election,” Colbert riffed. “And now, the world is facing another one who’s rolling tanks into Ukraine.” Many in attendance of the speech wore blue and yellow to show support for Ukraine – “a show of solidarity not seen since the last Minions movie”, Colbert joked. Biden led Congress in a symbolic standing ovation for Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US, who attended the speech as a guest of the first lady, Jill Biden. “It was a moving moment of bipartisan unity,” said Colbert of the gesture, “especially considering the last time Congress stood up that fast together, they were the ones fleeing a fascist invasion.” Biden also announced the US would close its airspace to all Russian flights, a move meant to also target the country’s oligarchs. “Boom! Now Russians will be stuck at their airports eating Cinna-borscht,” said Colbert. “But I tell you, if you really want to punish Russia, you’d divert all their flights to Newark.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel bemoaned the state of the union and international affairs. Biden “probably could’ve just saved himself some time and just tweeted that the State of the Union is ‘malarkey AF’”, he joked. “The state of our union is about as strong as Kim and Kanye right now,” Kimmel added, noting that “not every lawmaker showed up to watch the speech, which is not the usual.” The Florida senator Marco Rubio refused to attend because he declined to take the required Covid test. “I don’t have time to go take a Covid test today,” Rubio complained earlier on Tuesday. “I only take a test if I’m sick.” “Which, since you can have and spread Covid without any symptoms, is an incredibly stupid thing to say,” Kimmel responded. “But, in fairness, that is what Marco Rubio does. He is very on-brand. “You know why he won’t do it, right? You know why he won’t take it? Because if they swab his nose, it would probably test positive for Donald Trump’s butt.” And in other news, the international judo federation suspended Putin as its honorary president in response to the invasion of Ukraine, and Putin was also stripped of his honorary black belt in taekwondo. “Apparently, invading a peaceful country is a taekwon-don’t,” Kimmel quipped.",Arts/Culture,Trevor Noah: ‘Putin doesn’t know what it’s like to lose’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/02/trevor-noah-putin-biden-stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel
3/3/2022,"Police in Poland have warned that fake reports of violent crimes being committed by people fleeing Ukraine are circulating on social media after Polish nationalists attacked and abused groups of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern people who had crossed the border last night. Attackers dressed in black sought out groups of non-white refugees, mainly students who had just arrived in Poland at Przemyśl train station from cities in Ukraine after the Russian invasion. According to the police, three Indians were beaten up by a group of five men, leaving one of them hospitalised. “Around 7pm, these men started to shout and yell against groups of African and Middle Eastern refugees who were outside the train station,” two Polish journalists from the press agency OKO, who first reported the incident, told the Guardian. “They yelled at them: ‘Go back to the train station! Go back to your country.’” Police intervened and riot officers were deployed after groups of men arrived chanting “Przemyśl always Polish”. “I was with my friends, buying something to eat outside,” said Sara, 22, from Egypt, a student in Ukraine. “These men came and started to harass a group of men from Nigeria. They wouldn’t let an African boy go inside a place to eat some food. Then they came towards us and yelled: ‘Go back to your country.’” Following the incident, police in Poland warned that groups linked to the far right are already spreading false information about alleged crimes committed by people from Africa and the Middle East fleeing war in Ukraine. Przemyśl police said on Twitter: “In the media, there is false information that serious crimes have occurred in Przemyśl and the border: burglaries, assaults and rape. It’s not true. The police did not record an increased number of crimes in connection with the situation at the border. #StopFakeNews.” According to the news website Notes From Poland, one Facebook group, named Przemyśl Always Polish (Przemyśl Zawsze Polski), has been spreading false claims that “economic migrants from the Middle East” were committing crimes, “including a knife attack on a young woman and numerous thefts from shops”. The attacks on people fleeing the war come amid efforts by some African governments to evacuate their citizens who have passed into countries bordering Ukraine after reports of racist abuse and discrimination. On Wednesday, Nigeria’s foreign ministry said it planned to start airlifting more than 1,000 Nigerians stranded in countries neighbouring Ukraine. Many of the foreign nationals fleeing the Russian attacks are students. About 16,000 African students were studying in the country before the invasion, Ukraine’s ambassador to South Africa said this week. Reports and footage on social media in the past week have shown acts of discrimination and violence against African, south Asian and Caribbean citizens while fleeing Ukrainian cities and at some of the country’s border posts. In an interview with the Guardian, a 24-year-old medical student from Kenya, who did not want to be named, said she spent hours waiting for Ukrainian border guards to let her enter Poland because they were prioritising Ukrainian nationals. After eventually crossing the border, she boarded a free bus, organised by an NGO, to a hotel near Warsaw that was offering free board to Ukrainian refugees. But the hotel refused to take her and her Kenyan friends in, even after she offered to pay for a room. However, other foreign nationals interviewed by the Guardian said that they had been treated well by the Polish authorities, with many of the reports of racial abuse occurring on the Ukrainian side of the border. The Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, said on Monday: “All who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under the UN convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference,” citing reports that Ukrainian police had obstructed Nigerians. “From video evidence, first-hand reports, and from those in contact with … Nigerian consular officials, there have been unfortunate reports of Ukrainian police and security personnel refusing to allow Nigerians to board buses and trains heading towards Ukraine-Poland border,” he said. On Tuesday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, acknowledging the allegations, said: “Ukraine’s government spares no effort to solve the problem.” “Africans seeking evacuation are our friends and need to have equal opportunities to return to their home countries safely,” he said in a statement on Twitter. Ghana, South Africa and Ivory Coast are also among a growing number of African countries seeking to evacuate their citizens in response to reports of discrimination and violence that have sparked widespread outrage. In Nigeria, Gabriel Aduda, permanent secretary for the ministry of foreign affairs, said three jets chartered from local carriers would leave the country on Wednesday, with the capacity to bring back nearly 1,300 people from Poland, Romania and Hungary. Rights groups have welcomed the efforts by Poland to help, but some drew comparisons with the treatment of other refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Kurdish Iraqis in the country, where the populist rightwing government has often played on anti-refugee sentiment. Last year, after the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, organised the movement of refugees with the promise of a safe passage to Europe, thousands of people from the Middle East were caught by Polish border guards in the forests near the border and illegally and violently pushed back to Belarus.",News/Global development,People of colour fleeing Ukraine attacked by Polish nationalists,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/02/people-of-colour-fleeing-ukraine-attacked-by-polish-nationalists

In a short complaint filed in the Los Angeles federal court, the band Artikal Sound System claimed that Lipa’s 2020 hit Levitating was so similar to their 2017 song Live Your Life that it was “highly unlikely that Levitating was created independently”. It claimed that Lipa had “access” to their song, but did not detail how the musician – or cowriters Clarence Coffee Jr, Sarah Hudson, Stephen Kozmeniuk and cowriter/producer Stuart Price would have encountered it. Live Your Life is not on Spotify and has 34k plays on SoundCloud. A new upload to YouTube attracted 12k views in 10 hours, presumably from curious listeners seeking to compare the two recordings. The band also named parties including Lipa’s label, Warner Records, as defendants. They seek profits from Levitating in addition to damages. The Guardian has contacted representatives for Lipa for comment.

Cassie Winslow loves flowers – “they are so magical and special. They’re just a wonderful part of our world” – and has been using them as an ingredient for around a decade. The trend for edible flowers has been blooming for several years but, for many of us, the idea of munching petals, instead of admiring them, is still a leap. Winslow’s new book, Floral Provisions, guides you through the edible flower garden. “If you love flowers, it’s just another way to incorporate them into your life,” she says. Here’s her advice on how to do it. Just as you wouldn’t go grazing on any old leaf instead of lettuce, some flowers are very much inedible. Blame Instagram, which has hot-housed the edible flower trend, for promoting toxic, or even potentially lethal, flowers – such as rhododendron – shown adorning smoothies and puddings. Edible flowers include lavender, roses, hollyhocks, pelargoniums, nasturtiums and pansies. Some look similar – jasmine is fine, but false jasmine is poisonous; you can eat the flowers of garden peas, but not sweet peas. Anyone allergic to pollen should steer clear. Winslow grows a range of edible flowers but if you don’t have a garden, many edibles, such as pansies and violas, can be grown in window boxes. If you already have a vegetable patch or grow herbs, look out for the flowers they produce, such as chives and mint; vegetables, such as kale, produce flowers once they have bolted, the stage before going to seed. It is essential, says Winslow, not to use pesticides or other chemicals on flowers you are growing to eat. And don’t consume cut flowers, or flowers from plants from garden centres (or go with the Royal Horticultural Society’s advice and grow them on for at least three months, to reduce the impact of any chemical residue), as they will almost certainly have been treated. If you are foraging, the usual rules apply: identify what you are picking, don’t take too much and be wary of where you pick from; avoid roadsides, places likely to have been treated with pesticides and herbicides and areas frequented by animals. A large number of online suppliers sell fresh and dried flowers, and some supermarkets stock them. Winslow likes farmers’ markets and health food stores, where she has found more unusual flowers such as rosemary or broccoli flowers, saying: “There are so many different options now.” You can use the dried flowers sold as herbal tea – just about every supermarket stocks camomile tea (just cut open the teabags) and you may find others such as hibiscus, jasmine and rose. Winslow’s camomile and rose salts are an easy way to incorporate flowers into everyday cooking. Mix 5g of dried flowers (crushed to small flakes, but not into powder) with 100g of fine sea salt. Ideally, leave it for a week to let the flavour steep, but you can use it straight away. She uses both in everyday cooking. Camomile salt – it has a honeyed, herbaceous flavour, she says – goes on eggs, potatoes, and serves as a seasoning for chicken and pasta dishes. She keeps a pot of rose salt on her counter and it is used “in soups, on french fries, sprinkled on top of poached eggs, on top of chocolate chip cookies or chocolate ice-cream”. It doesn’t make everything taste of rose, she says, adding: “It’s very subtle and there’s a visual component that is really lovely.” Both salts are good on the rim of a cocktail glass, she says. Another pantry staple is sugars and syrups made from edible flowers for use in baking, says Winslow. Fresh flowers can add too much moisture to salts and sugars, making them clumpy, so are better for syrups. Her “garden party sugar” recipe is “like nature’s confetti”, and is easy to make: mix a tablespoon each of hibiscus, camomile, lavender, rose and calendula with 200g cane sugar. Use it in cakes and biscuits, as you would ordinary sugar – Winslow recommends it to prettify pancakes. To make lavender syrup, which Winslow likes to drizzle over ice-cream or cakes, as well as in cocktails and iced coffee, stir 200g granulated sugar, 10g lavender and 120ml filtered water over a medium heat until dissolved. Cook for another five minutes or so until it has thickened, then leave to cool, and strain with a sieve. She also recommends infusing honey with dried flowers. Too much flower power can be overwhelming and even cloying, so it’s worth doing a taste test to check the strength – dried flowers are usually stronger than fresh, but the taste can vary between producers and batches. The idea, says Winslow, isn’t to make everything taste of lavender or roses (unless you want it to), but to add a subtle extra dimension. For instance, the first time she added camomile salt to scrambled eggs, her husband said how good it was, but he couldn’t tell it was camomile. “It’s not overpowering like, ‘These are camomile eggs, this is weird’. It’s just a subtle flavour that is different to what you are used to.” While flowers work particularly well in drinks and desserts, Winslow likes to add them to savoury dishes. They can be baked into pizza dough and flatbread, and she makes cheese crackers flavoured with three tablespoons of dried calendula and a teaspoon of rose salt. “You see these beautiful little petals that are cooked in the crackers, and there’s a little spiciness that comes with the calendula.” Calendula is also added to a Gouda and bacon quiche. “Nasturtium is kind of spicy, so I like using it in savoury dishes,” she says. “It can be really good in salads, or pressed into crepes.” Mix fresh flowers into soft cheese or butter for pretty sandwiches, or to spread on toast. Some flowers veer towards more style than substance, lacking flavour but lovely to look at. “Why not add a little touch of beauty to everyday food?” says Winslow. “Seeing a little sprinkle of petals on something like a poached egg, or something that you eat regularly, really just brightens your day.”  Floral Provisions: 45+ Sweet and Savory Recipes by Cassie Winslow is published by Chronicle Books, £13.99.

3/3/2022,"A five-year-old Ukrainian boy with leukaemia who fled war-torn Kyiv on medical advice has arrived in Cork where he hopes to get life-saving treatment. Leonid Shapoval and his family were urged by his doctors last week to leave Ukraine, just days before he was due to get a bone marrow transplant. His mother’s aunt Victoria Walden, who lives in Cork, told RTÉ that the doctors were unequivocal. “The doctor gave Yana [the mother] all Leonid’s documents and said: ‘Run, just run. There is no way he is going to get any more treatment. We have to send him home. Because of war, we don’t know what’s going to happen’.” Leonid was due to get the transplant on 10 March after weeks of chemotherapy. He was able to travel to Ireland after the government lifted visa restrictions in response to the Russian invasion. A Gofundme page launched by a relative has raised more than €40,000 to pay for his treatment. There were emotional scenes as the boy and his parents arrived at Dublin airport on Monday night with just one suitcase, having crossed from Ukraine into Poland by land and then gone to Zurich. They were welcomed by Michael Collins, the independent TD for Cork South West, who was involved in the rescue mission, and officials from the department of foreign affairs.

3/3/2022,"Standing in the rain in the middle of a Northamptonshire truck stop, a Ukrainian lorry driver video-called his wife and children, who grinned and waved at him on the screen despite the peril facing their country. He is one of 13 drivers who have been stranded here for five days after the haulage companies they work for were unable to fund their fuel and toll passes in the midst of Russia’s invasion. All are desperate to get back to their families, some of whom are sheltering from missiles in Kyiv, and many are eager to join the fight against Putin’s forces. “We want to go back to our families, and we want to fight. We’re not scared. We want to do it for the love for our country,” said driver Sergei Muzyczenko, in Ukrainian translated by local volunteer Sabina Bazaud. “We’re phoning our families every day and getting information from them. My heart is in pain when I see videos of what is happening in Ukraine right now.” The group has been inundated with support from local people who have brought a steady stream of hot meals and warm clothes, and volunteers are working around the clock to fill the trucks with aid for the drivers to take with them back to Ukraine. The Salvation Army has offered to cover the £6,000 needed to pay for the 200 litres of fuel for each lorry, while Dan Zenchuk, a local British-Ukrainian who runs a logistics company, has offered to cover the money needed for tolls across Europe. “We’re hoping to get them on the road soon. They appreciate all the support, but they just want to go home. A lot of them are planning on going home and picking up arms and fighting straight away, so that’s on their mind as well as their families,” he said. “I’ll be happier when we see those lorries leaving and on the road, and we’re just hoping that what we’ve come up with is enough to get them there.” The group are sleeping in their trucks, while Welcome Break is allowing them to use the on-site shower and laundry facilities for free. Muzyczenko said the group had been “overwhelmed by the amount of people helping us”, and was keen to stress how they appreciated the UK’s news coverage of what is happening in Ukraine. Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine. Write to your local MP This can be a way to lobby the British government to place further sanctions on the Russian government and its associates. You can get in touch with your local MP via email or post to their constituency address. Instructions on how to get in touch can be found on parliament.uk. “The UK is saying the truth about Ukraine, because we’re hearing a lot of things from elsewhere, and there is a lot of propaganda and misinformation,” he said. “The information here is not fake.” In the meantime, local volunteers are struggling to keep up with the amount of supplies flooding in from people eager to help. “We have a lot of donations, my house is literally full and we have a lot of businesses offering help too,” said Bazaud, before she dashed off to receive another load. “I feel really proud of the response here,” said Zenchuk. “So many people have come forward and offered their help. I was at the truck stop for half an hour yesterday and about four or five cars turned up in that time alone, just to bring the drivers food, drink and other stuff.

3/3/2022,"If you were anywhere near social media this past Sunday night, you probably at least glimpsed the divisive mess that was the second season finale of Euphoria, HBO’s technicolor, gleefully excessive soap on the outsized trials and tribulations of suburban California teens. After a buzzy and acclaimed but modestly watched debut in 2019, the show’s second season has blown up: HBO announced Tuesday that Euphoria, with help from its new streaming home on HBO Max, is now its second most watched show since 2004. It averaged 16.3 million viewers an episode this season, behind only OG HBO juggernaut Game of Thrones, which drew an average of 44.2 million viewers during its final season in 2019. But perhaps more impressive, and telling, than its 2022 viewing stats is Euphoria’s digital footprint. According to Twitter, the drama is the most tweeted-about show of the (still young) decade, with 34m tweets in the US alone. This is by design: Euphoria, adapted by Sam Levinson from the Israeli show of the same name, is audacious in style, almost pugnaciously provocative in substance, with imitable peacocking fashion and easily memeable cutaways. In other words, catnip for the online crowd. Its buzziness is helped rather than hindered by a polarizing and, for many, narratively disappointing season that sidelined beloved characters, dropped plot lines, prioritized elaborate and visually ornate tangents over character development, doubled down on the drug abuse, dialed up the graphic violence, and went so far up its own ass as to have a character stage a Broadway-budget play about the show for its final two episodes. Call it disastrous, sublime, exhausting, narcissistic, magnetic or all of the above – no show aims for and captures the online discourse right now better than Euphoria. How did it become a social media lightning rod? Euphoria is a TV show of and for the internet – appealing to our instinct to be included and our evergreen fascination with high school, stoking a range of reactions from outrage to appreciation (or often both), offering looks and plenty of avenues for takes. Watching the second season finale – in which Lexi’s (Maude Apatow) tell-all play devolved into a catfight, beloved drug dealer Fezco’s (Angus Cloud) house went down in a hail of police gunfire, and cast member Dominic Fike sang an entire original song – felt like witnessing the life cycle of a Twitter Event. You get the dopamine hits of beautiful images and caps-locked emotion, swirled with wild tonal shifts, packaged with such maximalism and gratuity as to demand a reaction, and emerge wired by the chaos and worn out by the whole cycle. (Fike, at least, was a good sport about this – “The internet remains undefeated. I am humbled,” he posted on Instagram stories along with some memes and tweets mocking his song.) I’ll admit that I fall on the negative pole of the Euphoria debate. Midway through the season, I wrote that the show’s lurid style, lack of character development and general chaos had become both exhausting and boring; I found the finale to be a gratuitous trainwreck, save for a few quiet moments with genuine star Zendaya as (tidily recovered!) drug addict Rue. But I, too, enjoy submerging in the current swirl of reactions, reactions to the reactions, and gossip around Euphoria. (So, apparently, do some of the cast – “it’s fascinating,” said Sydney Sweeney of her character’s highly memeable bathtub moment. “It’s a beautiful thing when you have a character that so many people are able to relate to.”) The show has spawned a universe of memes – the Super Bowl as Maddy v Cassie, actor Alexa Demie’s mysterious age – and navel-gazy but immersive Twitter beef. (See: Tony-winning playwright Jeremy O Harris, a producer on the show and close friend of Levinson’s, sparring with critics over his tweet that Euphoria was “made for ppl with an intellect for CINEMA and not the impatience of TELEVISION” and likening it to Dickens). Dickens it is not, but Euphoria does have the evergreen appeal of the unrealistic teen soap, operating in the lane of the original Gossip Girl, Degrassi, Skins, Home and Away, One Tree Hill and The OC – shows depicting high schoolers played by hot twentysomething actors on an inherently ridiculous merry-go-round of drama. Euphoria shares many of the same tropes – a blonde v brunette love triangle, absent parents, etc – dressed up with enough expensive cinematography, fine acting, HBO budget and Dare-invoking material to merit serious critical discussion (and recaps on TikTok). Though it is HBO’s youngest-skewing show, Euphoria is best understood as a millennial’s revisionist fantasy of their own proto-social media high school days, if the current digital hellscape was our teenage playground. (Levinson, the creator who wrote and directed every episode this season, is 37.) As Delia Cai recently argued in Vanity Fair, Euphoria inflames the millennial generation’s already intense fascination with high school, particularly as a framework for articulating life online – what else is Twitter if not a more exposed and cutthroat high-school cafeteria? Gossip being fundamental to both, intrigue has swirled in the past couple months around alleged behind-the-scenes drama, with much of the frustration for the season’s shortcomings directed at Levinson, the creator whom fans love to hate. Videos tagged #SamLevinson have been viewed nearly 40m times on TikTok, according to the New York Times – nearly unheard of for an off-screen writer/director, and an unusual way to view a television show, which is usually the result of collaborative creative entropy. (Euphoria, unusually for a show of its size, has no writers’ room.) Rumors have circulated for months – on both anonymous gossip accounts such as Deuxmoi, AKA the Gossip Girl of the real world, and mainstream outlets – that tension between Levinson and Barbie Ferreira led to the reduction of fan-favorite Kat, the only plus-sized main character. There’s also the inexplicable and confusing absence of Algee Smith’s Christopher McKay, the show’s only black male teen, who appeared for only a brief scene in the first episode despite being a significant focus (and victim of traumatic, lavishly filmed fraternity hazing) in the first season. Interviews with numerous cast members, from Sweeney to guest actor Minka Kelly to Javon Walton, who plays Ashtray, have pointed to both the dominance of Levinson’s vision, his instincts for gratuity and the ad hoc fluidity of his process. Kelly and Sweeney said Levinson took their requests to not appear topless in scenes he scripted as such, igniting another round of controversy; some have pointed out (fairly, I would say) that Sweeney’s Cassie is still, more than any other character, frequently naked on the show, and that an actor having to push back repeatedly on nudity in a show about teenagers is … weird. It does not lessen Sweeney’s agency as an actor, and a season MVP at that, to note that several scenes featuring Cassie in distress – in an underboob bikini while housing a bottle of champagne, strutting in slo-mo down the aisle of Lexi’s play, in bed with a very toxic Nate (Jacob Elordi) – hinge on a fascination with, if not exploitation of, her body. The specter of Levinson’s marionette strings, the aura of the auteur, does color one’s view of the show – I would be more willing to forgive its mess, its instinct for nudity and its fixation with Rue and Cassie’s suffering if I knew it was the result of some bonkers writing room, not the brain of one person. It is easy to conflate Euphoria with Levinson, to put intense feelings with the former on to the latter, and for said frustration to loop back into its own online joke. As Vulture writer Iana Murray put it in a recent recap, Levinson’s “writing or his provocations” are “not only a frequent target of criticism but a bona fide meme at this point”. Hate-watching, spectacle rubbernecking, chaos enjoyment is not unique to Euphoria (see: The Morning Show season two), but the second season has achieved an almost high art of ambivalence, a spectacle in which intensity of style (and provocation) begets intensity of reaction. Or, in the words of one TikTok commenter: “I am so aggravated by this show and I will watch absolutely every episode.” Maybe Euphoria’s third season, which will probably not air until the unfathomable year of 2024, will course correct, put some guardrails on the chaos, or hire more writers. To quote the new Euphoria song by Zendaya and Labrinth, I’m Tired. Or maybe not – the second season’s shock and shimmer may have generated as many angry tweets as awed ones, but online talk is not cheap. And teen nostalgia knows that feeling anything, everything, is better than nothing at all.",Arts/Television & radio,How did Euphoria become the most loved and hated show on TV?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/02/euphoria-most-loved-hated-tv-show
3/3/2022,"Zoe Daniel’s campaign has launched a supreme court challenge against a Victorian council ruling that the independent candidate’s signs cannot be erected before the federal election is called. On Friday, the Bayside city council backflipped on an earlier ruling, instead finding in favour of the Liberal MP Tim Wilson, who complained that Daniel’s signs had been put up prematurely. The council has now begun threatening residents with fines if they don’t “remove or completely cover” the signs. Daniel’s campaign manager, Keith Badger, will act as plaintiff in a case against the council seeking a declaration that the signs are lawful. Bylaws provide that signs may only be displayed for 14 days after an event or three months in total. Bayside claims that, because the House of Representatives election is not technically due until 3 September, signs put up before 3 June are unlawful – until the election is called. Wilson wrote to his constituents in February urging them to dob in allegedly unlawful Daniel campaign signs. On Monday, the council wrote to volunteers warning the council had received “a number of complaints” about political signs, asserting they “can only be displayed when an election has been called”. “As no election has been called the political sign displayed on your property is unauthorised,” it said. It warned that “fines may be issued for not complying with state legislation”, urging those displaying signs to “remove or completely cover them” within two days. Daniel had objected to the council’s ruling, arguing it was inconsistent with neighbouring councils’ interpretations of the rules, including in the neighbouring federal seat of Kooyong where treasurer Josh Frydenberg signs have proliferated. The challenge will also argue the council has interpreted the law incorrectly, contradicted its earlier advice to Daniel volunteers, and its interpretation is contrary to the implied freedom of political communication. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Badger has sworn an affidavit which notes that Daniel’s campaign identified that name recognition would be critical because she was running without party backing. “Where a candidate has no previous association with politics in the electorate [lack of recognition] becomes the biggest barrier to engaging in a fair contest,” he said. Badger argued Wilson had “significant financial backing of the party of government” whereas Daniel was relying on “the goodwill of our community to get the word out through displaying their enthusiasm” on signs.

3/3/2022,"The New South Wales deputy premier, Paul Toole, has been accused of using the state’s flood disaster to “guilt trip” critics of the Coalition government’s proposal to expand and build new dams. Labor, the Greens and independent MPs have rebuked Toole who used a press conference about the flooding emergency on Wednesday to address opposition to projects such as the proposed raising of the Warragamba Dam wall. Toole had been asked a question about flood mitigation in Sydney and responded by urging critics of dam projects to “get out of the way”. “Stop coming up with excuses and not allowing these dams to be built or raised where they need to be,” he said. “Stop using the excuse of a moth. I say that protecting property and human lives should be the number one priority – not protecting some moth.” The opposition and crossbench accused Toole of taking “political potshots” in the middle of a catastrophe. “How dare the deputy premier use the death and destruction caused by these floods to guilt-trip the public into supporting the National party’s pet project of new dams,” Greens MLC Cate Faehrmann said. Faehrmann chaired a NSW parliamentary inquiry into the rationale and impacts of new dams and other water infrastructure in NSW. She said successive National party water ministers had refused to factor climate change into water-sharing plans in the state. “Now we’re supposed to believe that it’s climate change behind their push for massive dams that don’t stack up economically or environmentally? Give me a break,” she said. The NSW opposition’s water spokesperson, Rose Jackson, said Toole’s comments were “immature and unhelpful”. “We’re in the middle of a major flood catastrophe and he’s seeking to take political potshots,” she said. Jackson said much of the concern about the Warragamba wall raising proposal had come from within NSW government departments. The NSW department of planning, industry and environment, Heritage NSW and Sydney Water have all voiced substantial concerns about the project during the planning process. The government has also been warned the Warragamba project could put Australia in breach of its obligations under the world heritage convention. “Drawing attention to the astronomical costs, impact on precious world heritage areas and important indigenous landmarks should not be dismissed as insignificant ‘excuses’, they are critical parts of this decision-making process,” Jackson said. She said the moth that Toole referred to was not actually an issue at Warragamba but instead related to another project that had not been proposed for the purpose of flood mitigation. The golden sun moth is a species that would be affected by a proposal to raise the Wyangala Dam wall near Cowra. The cost of environmental offsets to compensate for damage to the moth’s habitat has been raised recently on Sydney radio station 2GB. The project was originally conceived not for flood mitigation but to increase water storage and drought resilience and was last year put on hold by the government itself after advice from NSW Treasury. Another proposal to build a dam at Mole River, also for water security, was postponed too. In response to questions from Guardian Australia, Toole said his focus was “on the safety and wellbeing of the people of our state during these devastating floods”. “I will not be distracted by sideline commentary while many people across NSW are in the grip of this natural disaster,” he said after Wednesday’s press conference where he demanded people “get out of the way”. Harry Burkitt, of the Colong Foundation for Wilderness, said the deputy premier had used a time of emergency to “further ridiculous culture wars about dam building”. “We continue to stand alongside the Insurance Council of Australia and the nation’s leading flood experts in opposing the raising of the Warragamba Dam wall,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Justin Field, an independent MLC who is chairing a separate inquiry into the Warragamba project, said the inquiry had heard “expert evidence of how raising dam walls can lead to a false sense of security and higher flood risks”. “Governments often use new dams to justify more development on floodplains exposing more people and property to harm when walls are inevitably overtopped,” Field said. “We need an honest, nuanced and science-based conversation about how we are going to prepare our communities to mitigate and adapt to increasing climate risks and that is happening in many communities already.” Prof Jamie Pittock, a professor of environmental policy at the Australian National University, said the $2bn Warragamba proposal would not control flood waters that come in from downstream tributaries in the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment, such as South Creek. Pittock has previously criticised the plan to raise the wall and called for consideration of alternatives – including relocating people at the greatest risk from flooding. He said flood infrastructure projects could perversely encourage more development on flood plains, leading to greater catastrophe when an overflow occurred. “When the inevitable big one comes you end up with a more dangerous situation because you have more people, homes and businesses in harm’s way,” he said. The director of the graduate school of engineering at the University of New South Wales, Prof Stuart Khan, said Toole’s comments were disappointing. “In the past few days we have lost lives in Lismore and we are facing the real risk of losing more in the Hawkesbury-Nepean valley,” Khan said. “I understand that the NSW government believe they have identified a solution to prevent or mitigate future flooding in western Sydney. “But they also know that the obstacles to the implementation of that proposed solution are much more complex than someone having prioritised a moth over the protection of human lives.” Khan said it was clear raising the wall would not stop flooding in the Hawkesbury-Nepean river basin. “As we are seeing right now, the Warragamba catchment is not the only source of flood waters in the valley,” he said. “Floods also arise from the Upper Nepean River, the Grose River, the Colo River, the McDonald River, Eastern Creek and South Creek.”",News/Australia news,NSW deputy premier savaged for fighting dam building ‘culture war’ during floods disaster,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/nsw-deputy-premier-savaged-for-fighting-dam-building-culture-war-during-floods-disaster
3/3/2022,"A push within the Victorian Labor party to knock off Kim Carr is gaining traction with the veteran senator set to face a preselection challenge before the federal election. After the national takeover of the Victorian branch withstood a legal challenge from unions last week, party figures are turning their minds to the Victorian Senate ticket, which is yet to be resolved just weeks from an expected election campaign. Carr is almost certain to be challenged from within the party’s left faction and there is mounting speculation that Kimberley Kitching could also face a contest. Senior party figures have become increasingly hostile to the first-term senator who was Bill Shorten’s controversial pick to replace Stephen Conroy in a casual vacancy in 2016. Guardian Australia understands at least two people from within Carr’s own left faction are likely to nominate for the Senate ticket: Linda White, the former Australian Services Union assistant national secretary, and Ryan Batchelor, a former staffer to Julia Gillard and the executive director of the McKell Institute. The labour lawyer Josh Bornstein, who previously expressed interest in nominating but then withdrew after a series of negative stories about historic tweets was published in the Australian, is also still considering a tilt. Despite Carr indicating he will again contest the Senate position he has held since 1993, senior factional sources say he has lost both union and rank and file support from within the left in Victoria “I don’t think anything can save Kim now,” one senior figure said. Another said: “There is a strong argument for renewal and I don’t think there is any support for Kim having a fourth decade in the Senate.” Carr and the federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, are longstanding political rivals, with Carr responsible for shifting a small but significant number of parliamentary numbers to install Shorten as leader ahead of Albanese in 2013. Carr also publicly split with his left caucus colleagues in 2016 after they voted to remove him from the frontbench but he then formed his own mini-faction in defiance to ensure he remained in Shorten’s ministry. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Nominations are expected to open for the Senate positions before parliament resumes later this month, with the federal executive hoping a consensus candidate emerges from the left faction to take on Carr. However, senior members of the Victorian left said they wanted the federal executive to put in train the process so that candidates can come forward and a consensus can then be reached. It is understood that sitting Labor MP Andrew Giles is supporting Batchelor, while veteran left powerbroker Alan Griffin is supporting White.

Kevin Rudd, who relied on Carr for support to retake the leadership from Gillard, excoriated Bornstein in a piece in the Sydney Morning Herald last month, suggesting he could not be trusted by Labor members not to leave “when the going gets tough”. However, Bornstein is understood to continue to be encouraged to run by his good friend and party veteran Greg Combet. A 40-member selection panel of the Victorian left is expected to vote on a candidate to put forward to national executive as a replacement for Carr once a preselection process is established. As the left closes in on Carr, party figures on the right are also in talks about the fate of Kimberley Kitching, who most recently antagonised colleagues after she used parliamentary privilege to name the Chinese billionaire Chau Chak Wing as “the puppeteer mentioned” in Asio boss Mike Burgess’s case study of an alleged foreign interference plot. Burgess replied he would not comment on “speculation” about identities “and it’s unfair you ask me that question in public”. While Kitching has little support within the Labor caucus, sources said it would be left to the fragmented Victorian right to determine whether to offer up a different candidate. While dumping a one-term senator is unusual, it is not unprecedented, with Labor dumping the South Australian senator Linda Kirk in 2008 after one term after a falling out with the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association over her support for the abortion pill RU486.",News/Australia news,Long-serving Labor senator Kim Carr set to lose seat in preselection challenge,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/long-serving-labor-senator-kim-carr-set-to-lose-seat-in-preselection-challenge
3/3/2022,"Before each summer and winter Paralympics, Tony Naar and his small team of enthusiastic volunteers set themselves a challenge: to create a Wikipedia page for every Australian para-athlete competing at the Games. In the past decade, this group – known as the Australian Paralympic history project – have created over 1,000 articles for para-athletes past and present. For each one, however, they have faced an obstacle: Wikipedia’s notability policy, which requires articles to “be notable, or ‘worthy of notice’”. The project began prior to the London 2012 Paralympics. At the time, they partnered with Wikimedia Australia, the local chapter of the global Wikimedia Foundation, to offer an incentive: the two volunteers who created and edited the most articles ahead of the Games would win a free trip to London. “But one of the things we confronted was the notability requirement,” says Naar, a semi-retired sports administrator who previously worked for Paralympics Australia. “If you’re an Olympic athlete, you automatically met those notability requirements – just by being an Olympic athlete. Being a Paralympic athlete wasn’t good enough – you had to be a medallist or otherwise meet the notability requirements.” In other words, para-athletes who had qualified for the Paralympics did not automatically qualify for Wikipedia. “That meant the people involved in the project had to be pretty creative,” says Naar. “They had to hunt down other sources to justify having the article about the athlete. For example, newspaper articles or radio or television interviews. It was a question of frantically hunting those down ahead of London.” Ultimately, they succeeded – just prior to the 2012 Paralympics, every Australian Paralympian competing in London had their own Wikipedia page. Their hard work provided a valuable service; over the two weeks of the Games, they had almost two million page views. “It opened a lot of eyes [within the Paralympics community] because it way exceeded any other numbers,” says Naar. “The ABC televised the Paralympics and it way exceeded their views; it way exceeded views on Paralympics Australia’s official website. It indicated that there was a lot of interest in finding out information and Wikipedia was a great source for that.” One might think that Wikipedia’s notability distinction between Olympic and Paralympic athletes was blatantly discriminatory and would have been swiftly changed after London 2012. Naar chuckles with resignation. “God no,” he says. “It has been a battle that we have fought a few times and have lost every time. At the moment that notability requirement stands – just being a Paralympian still doesn’t qualify you.” Nonetheless, thanks to the team’s creativity, they have managed to create or update Wikipedia articles for every Australian para-athlete competing at Sochi 2014, Rio 2016, PyeongChang 2018 and Tokyo 2020, plus historical entries for past Paralympians. By the end of 2021, the team had written 617,797 words across almost 1,100 articles. In total, these articles have received just shy of 20 million page views. These Wikipedia entries are the most visible part of the Paralympic history project’s tireless work. But it represents just the tip of the iceberg. The project began in 2010, when Naar, who had been with Paralympics Australia (then the Australian Paralympic Committee) for a decade in various leadership roles, became aware that Kevin Coombs OAM was unwell. Coombs, a wheelchair basketballer, is a hugely significant figure; he was the first Indigenous athlete to represent Australia at a Paralympic or Olympic Games, competing at five Paralympics and carrying the torch into the Sydney 2000 Paralympic opening ceremony. “I’d been aware that Paralympics Australia and the Paralympic team were very innovative and forward looking, really in the moment,” says Naar. “But there wasn’t a massive amount of understanding or recognition of where the movement had gone before; it was very much based on the present, without acknowledgement of the past.” A colleague expressed concern that Coombs was unwell (he is now 80) and suggested that they might interview the Paralympic legend. “That was really the impetus to get the project off the ground,” Naar says. He contacted the National Library of Australia and suggested they might expand their oral history project to include past Paralympians. Within weeks they had recorded an interview with Coombs. “We just took it from there,” he adds. Today, the National Library has over 50 oral history interviews with significant Paralympic figures. The interview precipitated a moment of reflection at Paralympics Australia. “We thought, well, how can we capture the history of the movement in Australia?” says Naar. “What’s the best way of going about that?” Some wanted a book, but Naar was keen think bigger. “Lots of organisations produce books, but you tend to produce a few hundred copies, you give away 50 and the other 250 copies sit in boxes for years until someone throws them out,.” Instead, Naar and Professor Keith Lyons at the University of Canberra approached Wikimedia Australia, who were immediately interested in the project. Blending digital and orthodox history, through academic, sporting and institutional partners, the Australian Paralympic history project was born. “It is a unique digital history project which combines traditional history elements and manages, presents and preserves them digitally in a way that is relevant to how people seek and use information in the 21st century,” says Naar. They are also working on a book, which will be published shortly. In 2013, with the University of Queensland, the project received a grant of $250,000 from the Australian Research Council, in addition to funding from Paralympics Australia. The group have used the funding to engage researchers, conduct Wikipedia workshops, develop a 3,000-image strong photo library and create an interactive website. “We wanted to make it as accessible as possible,” Naar adds. “If you wanted to find out about the history of the Paralympic movement in Australia, anyone, anywhere could find it.” The Tasmanian has been at the forefront of this work, initially as a Paralympic Australia employee and then contractor, together with an ad hoc group of about 60 volunteers (including Greg Blood, who creates the helpful Australia at the Paralympics summary pages each Games). While Paralympics Australia’s funding for the project ceased in May 2020 due to Covid-related cuts, Naar has continued on in an unpaid capacity – coordinating volunteers and managing the wider project. Despite the current lack of financial support, Naar hopes that the project will endure. He says it has helped fill major gaps in Paralympic history: when the project started, Paralympics Australia only had archive imagery dating back to 1996; the project has subsequently collected photos from Australia’s participation in the first Games, in 1960, and at every Paralympics since. They have also hosted reunions for early teams, including a 50th anniversary of the 1960 Paralympics. “The fact that five decades later we could talk to the people who had been at the first Paralympic Games was very powerful,” Naar says. Asked why he continues to work 20 hours a week, unpaid, on this project, Naar underscores the importance of history. “For me, it’s an ongoing acknowledgement of the people who made the movement what it is today. It’s important for sporting organisations to have a history and recognise that history.” Current and former Paralympic athletes have expressed gratitude for the team’s work preserving their historic achievements. Naar cites a recent example to underscore the importance of accurately preserving history. “Last year in Tokyo, when Madison de Rozario won gold, the commentary team was saying that this was the first female Australian to win the Paralympic marathon,” he says. They were not the only ones – most news coverage led with this claim. Only, it was wrong. “In actual fact, Jan Randles won a gold medal in the first wheelchair marathon held in 1984,” Naar says. (Embarrassingly, this author made the same error). The project has since collaborated with Randles to provide more information online. “Jan got fairly upset by the whole thing and we’ve since worked with her to make sure that the [Wikipedia] article has been updated and is more comprehensive and her story is out there. It means a huge amount to her.” When Australia’s Winter Paralympians take to the slopes in Beijing this week, they can take heart knowing their achievements will be accurately recorded for future generations. And, despite Wikipedia’s discriminatory notability requirement, Naar and his colleagues will have found a way to ensure that every para-athlete has their own page even before the opening ceremony begins.",Sport/Sport,Half a million words and 20m views: the project preserving Australia’s Paralympic history | Kieran Pender,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/03/half-a-million-words-and-20m-views-the-project-preserving-australias-paralympic-history
3/3/2022,"On a Sunday afternoon two years ago, a week after the pubs closed across the country, I was at the office where I worked with homeless people in the Perth CBD. Scott Morrison had just given a national cabinet address “strongly advising” Aboriginal people over 50 with health conditions to stay home and isolate, part of an edict banning public gatherings of more than two people to be introduced in the coming days. I could see about 20 people sitting together outside the front door, including several older Aboriginal people, so I walked out to give them the latest update. One had been released from hospital earlier that day after a Covid scare. “Not much chance for isolating here,” she said, looking around with a rueful laugh. It is disturbing to see how little has changed for Perth’s homeless as the first Covid cases swept through this highly vulnerable community recently. Homeless people are already sicker and older than the general population, and more than 40% of the roughly 1,000 people currently on the street in Perth are Aboriginal. Vaccination rates for homeless people in Perth are also much lower than the general population, lower even than the remote communities that have rightly received so much focus in Western Australia’s regions. In a health audit conducted in January, only 38% of homeless Aboriginal people were double dosed, and just 7% of Perth’s homeless had received their booster. With months to wait between second and third doses and WA’s border opening on Thursday as cases surge, vaccination strategies rolling out now aren’t worth the paper they’re written on. The government also has a rough sleeper accommodation action plan but they still have no timeline for getting people off the streets and into hotels or temporary camps if required. It appears that despite two years to prepare behind WA’s hard border, the government has failed to learn from its abject failure first time round. While other states got thousands off the streets at the outset of Covid, the WA government was paralysed by the crisis engulfing Perth’s empty streets in the early days of the pandemic. They got a handful of people into a Perth hotel for a month and a few more into a camp south of Fremantle once their hand was forced. For the next year, a series of highly visible camps emerged as political flashpoints that drove extensive coverage of WA’s homelessness and public housing crisis. At the subsequent 2021 state budget, the WA government announced what it called “the single biggest public housing investment in this state’s history”. It was a direct response to highly vulnerable families standing up, speaking out and sharing their stories to drive political change. The new housing is better than nothing, but is too little too late for more than 100 people who have died homeless in Perth since the start of the pandemic. These deaths have prompted calls for a coronial inquest to examine the root causes of this relentless catastrophe, and led to a parliamentary inquiry to investigate the homelessness crisis in WA. There are currently more than 18,000 families languishing on the public housing waitlist in WA, as the private rental vacancy rate drops to another all-time low. A new hostel for Aboriginal homeless people in the heart of Perth offers a temporary solution to the immediate crisis, but it’s currently half empty despite Covid cases on nearby streets and multiple people dying homeless on the same street last winter. More than two thirds of people who were at one of the camps still have housing a year later. But that still leaves people whose names are on the list for the new hostel unable to get in, joining all the others on the street outside. WA abandoned highly vulnerable people on the frontline of a global pandemic and they are still stranded today. Camps and hotels have worked before and they could work again now. The government needs to get everyone off the street now. If they don’t, those returning to Perth for the first time in two years may find more people sick and dying on the streets of the CBD with no more than a tent to protect them.

3/3/2022,"The value of Russian investments held by Australia’s biggest super fund, AustralianSuper, has plummeted as sanctions and economic panic following the invasion of Ukraine ravage what was a $300m portfolio. On Wednesday afternoon AustralianSuper, which has assets of about $245bn and looks after the retirement savings of 2.5 million people, had yet to decide whether to join other Australian funds in dumping Russian stocks. However, a dramatic collapse in the share price of Russia’s biggest bank, Sberbank, which is subject to sanctions by the US and UK, has already torn a $137m hole in the value of Aussie Super’s Russian investments. More Australian and international corporate players moved to distance themselves from Russia on Wednesday, with ExxonMobil announcing it would “discontinue operations” and exit the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field it operates in Russia’s far east, and consumer brands Apple, Ford and Google halting sales in the country. On Tuesday night, super funds Rest and Cbus followed the lead of $130bn fund Aware, Australia’s sovereign wealth fund the Future Fund, and the NSW state government in pledging to divest from Russian assets as soon as possible. Both Rest and Cbus said Russian assets made up less than 0.1% of their total investment portfolios. Hampering divestment efforts, Russia’s central bank kept the Moscow stock exchange closed from Monday until at least Wednesday, making it impossible to sell shares listed there. However, some Russian companies have secondary listings elsewhere. This includes Sberbank, which is listed on the London exchange. The price of Sberbank securities listed in London collapsed from US$15.65 in December, when Aussie listed its holding as worth almost $140m, to as little as US21c on Tuesday after new US sanctions obliterated its European business. At that price, Aussie’s stake in Sberbank is now worth as little as $1.8m. AustralianSuper declined to comment but it is believed the fund is considering whether dumping its Russian portfolio would be in the best financial interests of members – the test managers must meet following changes to super law introduced by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, last year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Julien Vincent, the executive director of activist investor group Market Forces, said AustralianSuper’s members would be “rightly appalled to learn their super fund has been invested in companies driving the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. “Silence from a fund that claims to be a leader on issues of corporate responsibility, especially when others are providing at least a mea culpa on their investments in Russian oil and gas, is an abject failure of leadership.” He questioned why AustralianSuper held shares in Russian fossil fuel companies in the first place. Research by Guardian Australia shows that Aussie’s Russian assets include shares and bonds issued by the world’s biggest natural gas company, Gazprom, that are valued on the fund’s books at $3.7m, as well as shares in oil company Rosneft valued at $24.7m. Shares in Rosneft are likely to tumble in value if trade resumes on the Moscow exchange because oil multinational BP has promised to sell its 19.7% stake in the group.

Vekselberg is Falcon’s biggest shareholder, owning 16% of the company through his investment vehicle Lamesa Holdings. Activist investor group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility dismissed the resignation of Vekselberg’s representative, Maxim Mayorets, as “window dressing”. “Vekelsberg stands to personally benefit from any successful exploration that Origin is conducting in the Beetaloo Basin,” the ACCR’s director of climate and environment, Dan Gocher, said. “Origin has little choice but to suspend its joint venture with Falcon Oil & Gas until such time as Viktor Vekelsberg’s interests in the company are resolved.” Meanwhile, IFM Investors, a group through which industry super funds make investments into things such as airports, toll roads and the like, said it had “no direct investors nor investments that are included on relevant global sanctions lists”. “IFM has no direct exposure to Russia through its infrastructure, debt and private equity portfolios,” it said. “IFM does have a global listed equities indexing capability, where it manages money indexed to the MSCI All Country Index, which includes very limited exposure to Russia.” MSCI is reported to be considering dropping Russian stocks from its indexes after declaring the Moscow market “uninvestable”.",News/Australia news,AustralianSuper’s $300m of Russian investments plunge as sanctions bite,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/australiansupers-300m-of-russian-investments-plunge-as-sanctions-bite
3/3/2022,"I’ve missed people. Thanks to something called Covid-19 (look it up), I’ve been around other human beings less and less over the past couple of years. And I’ve missed you! I’ve missed overhearing couples bicker on the train, and watching Insta girls’ photoshoots get ruined by their dog, and seeing cocky business guys with Bluetooth headsets trip over on the footpath. And most of all I’ve missed my favourite brand of real-world comedy: the moment when absurdity meets reality; the strange brew of “absolutely 100% real” and “that has to be fake”. Luckily for me, the internet has a bunch of this sorta stuff on it, so it turns out I didn’t need real life at all! Here’s 10 of my faves. There’s some magic in these clips that says something powerful about humanity striving for connection. Or maybe it’s just funny to see people screw up. You be the judge. This is exactly what I’m on about. Diane Morgan (genius character comedian) embodies her dense and rude journalist character Philomena Cunk so fully and completely that when real experts sit opposite her in an interview setting they are forced to react. Will they mock her? Or try to help her? It’s watching real people have to decide in the moment whether to be empathetic to a dumb asshole. I love it, and I love her, but we’re both in long-term relationships plus she’s never heard of me so it probably wouldn’t work out. You either like Jackass or you don’t. I won’t waste valuable words trying to convert the second group. All I’ll say is this clip is a real life Looney Tunes of harmless fun, and I wish it went for another 30 minutes. Remember when the internet acted all shocked and surprised when John Mulaney split with his wife, then went on a bender, then started dating a celebrity, then got that celebrity pregnant? I wasn’t surprised. Because the dark, manic side of Mulaney has always been right in front of us in his character of George from Oh, Hello. This is a 90-minute improvised conversation where you get to watch Mulaney’s mind work in real time in response to unrehearsed questions from the moderator and the crowd, and – guess what – he’s evil as hell.

Comedians and married couple Brendon Walsh and Amanda Conrad host the podcast the World Record Podcast where they spend 99% of their time prank-calling local businesses and testing the patience of middle management. It’s addictive listening. These two are artists at keeping people on the hook, and guiding them towards snapping. This one features a soulful performance from Amanda as a lady whose car AI keeps insulting her. These dudes made two of my favourite shows of the last decade. Nathan For You and How To with John Wilson were flipsides of the same coin, capturing real human beings in moments of their most absurd. This clip begins as a genuine behind-the-scenes video, but soon morphs into performance art from two guys who love cringe as much as I do. OK this has nothing to do with my theme of “absurdity v reality”, but it’s a go-to sketch I watch when I need a cheer-up. Plus there’s something incredibly surreal in seeing acclaimed actor Tom Hanks commit so fully to the most outrageous SNL character piece since the days of MacGruber. Yeah, now we’re back on theme! It’s Tom Hanks (Oscar winner) doing something wacky! That kinda fits. The Office made its debut in 2001 and everyone tried to copy its mockumentary format, but none ever really lived up to it. Until This Country. Daisy May Cooper and Charlie Cooper are a sibling duo from regional Britain who’ve made a comedy about class that’s the closest thing I’ve seen to being a real documentary – mostly because the rest of the cast is made up of the real-life locals of their home town. Kyle Mooney is now on SNL, but in the early internet days when he first started posting on YouTube, I had no idea who this guy was. YouTube sketch was so new and unformed that I even thought this guy might be a real interviewer for a few seconds. His style – of being nervous to talk to even the most ordinary of people – instantly makes forces his subjects to step up and take charge of the interview. So funnnyyyyyyyyyy. This was Sacha Baron Cohen’s big comeback to pranking people on TV and I can’t explain to you how excited me and all my comedian friends were. This prank on former Republican politician Jason Spencer (he was forced to resign after what he does in this clip) was a highlight. How on Earth does he get people to do this? And how do they believe the insane prosthetic job? The idea of getting the highly coveted standup comedy spot on The Tonight Show, and wasting it with a semi-scripted meltdown is so inherently funny to me. I love to imagine regular Americans at home watching it with furrowed brows, not realising it’s a bit. Cameron James is a comedian and podcaster.

3/3/2022,"The closure of local newspapers in many of the flood-hit towns in northern New South Wales has left some victims invisible and made residents increasingly reliant on local Facebook groups for information. Rupert Murdoch’s media empire stopped printing the 160-year-old Northern Star newspaper in Lismore last April, ten months before the worst flooding in history hit the northern NSW town. The Star was one of at least 20 News Corp Australia mastheads which were absorbed by capital city mastheads. The Star also lost its own website, becoming a page on the Daily Telegraph website as well as going behind a paywall. The Tweed Daily News in Tweed Heads was to suffer the same fate, merging with the Tele in May 2020, as did the Byron Shire News and the Ballina Shire Advocate. When the floods hit Lismore in 2017 the paper had a relatively well-resourced newsroom. But this week, as the devastating floods reached residents of northern NSW and south-east Queensland, locals have increasingly been turning to local Facebook pages as traditional sources of news have dried up. Lived in Lismore during the 2017 #Lismoreflood and reported for the Northern Star. At dawn today messaging friends there, one said she and her brother were standing on their verandah nearly 3m off the ground, waist high in water waiting for the #SES. Devastated for the community. While the ABC on the north coast is covering the deluge well, it can’t be everywhere. The ABC’s regional Lismore bureau has a chief of staff, six reporters and two presenters. When there is a major news event, they are joined by TV and radio reporters from the news division as well. Journalism Education and Research Association of Australia (Jeraa) president, Alex Wake, said the ABC’s coverage of Lismore’s floods was “quite gripping” but nearby towns were not receiving the same attention. “There has been some extraordinarily good reporting from people on the ground, and some heart-wrenching first person accounts,” Wake told Guardian Australia. “During the flooding I spoke to someone in Murwillumbah who said that all the focus was on Lismore, and nothing on them. Even their postcode wasn’t being read out as being eligible for relief payments. There are no journalists located there, just local Facebook groups.” The slow disappearance of local news is being tracked by the Public Interest Journalism Initiative’s Australian Newsroom Mapping Project. Last month the project revealed that 6.3%, or 33 local government areas, had no local print or digital news coverage. “Facebook and WhatsApp groups can be awesome sources of very local information during emergencies from people who know backroads and ways to get around issues,” Wake said. “They became absolutely vital during the bushfires and now the floods. But they also aren’t run by professionals and not always updated in real time. “They can degenerate into unseemly battles where mud-slinging and personal grievances come out. They can also post seriously out-of-date information or fake information, potentially causing bigger problems for authorities.” In Kingscliff, population 11,000, the local Facebook group has more than 30,000 members and is administrated by journalist of 30 years and former editor of the Tweed Coast Weekly Tania Phillips. Phillips started Kingscliff Happenings in 2015 to fill the gap left by the Weekly’s closure a year earlier, and “because she just can’t help herself”. This week it has been a constant hive of activity as Phillips has spent countless hours providing safety information, coordinating volunteers and answering locals’ many questions. It is the same dedication that saw her named Tweed Shire Council’s Volunteer of the Year in 2020. At the time, she wrote on LinkedIn that the award was recognition “not so much for me but that we need journalism in small towns and regions, that it needs not to be dictated by outside sources and featuring stories from elsewhere to pad it out, but run by communities for communities. That’s how we survive – real journalists. I’m still working on how I feed my family!!” But not every town is lucky to have someone as experienced as Phillips at the helm. Wake says she would not want to be a local Facebook administrator right now. “Imagine someone posting that they were in a life-and-death situation and you’re just a mum sitting at a computer a suburb away with no power to help. The administrators aren’t trained to cope with truly stressed people.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The vice-president of Jeraa, Peter English, told a regional newspaper parliamentary inquiry this week many stories from the recent floods featured “little value added through on-the-ground reporting”, with so few regional towns covered by journalists. “People are relying on social media for images, both images that are real and things that might not be real,” English said. “That may have impacted on the [flood-related] decisions they’ve made in terms of leaving their house or staying.” “The employment of journalists who are embedded in local communities is essential,” English said. “Only local reporters can understand how local issues impact on their local areas, not someone trying to report remotely.”",News/Media,NSW flood-affected towns turn to Facebook and WhatsApp after local news sources disappear,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/03/nsw-flood-affected-towns-turn-to-facebook-and-whatsapp-after-local-news-sources-disappear

Did this Adam guy not see Back to the Future? Did he miss that whole bit about how you’re not supposed to interact with past you? Expect a broadly appealing film that plays to the back rows. TV, US, 2022 – out 25 March Luxurious locations and costumes, lascivious characters and oodles of soapy drama in a Regency setting, with Julie Andrews as the narrator – yep, the first season of Bridgerton sure ticked some boxes. The result was nothing less than one of Netflix’s all-time most watched shows. Returning to the Bridgerton family, the second season will be centred around its eldest son, Lord Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey). Expect more seasons where this came from. TV, Australia, 2022 – out 9 March There’s an argument that says reality TV isn’t an inferior genre, just a different approach to telling quintessentially human stories. Of course this is total bollocks: all these shows should be turned into material forms so they can be stuffed into a giant cannon and shot into the sun. Netflix’s new reality series, inevitably full of good-looking attention seekers, has been a magnet for controversy – first generating community uproar from the locals of Byron Bay, then when some of the cast allegedly flouted Covid health measures. I include Byron Baes grudgingly, in recognition that it may well be a water-cooler production. But you know what I think: cannon/shot/sun. Honourable mentions: Against the Ice (film, 2 March); Pieces of Her (TV, 4 March); The Andy Warhol Diaries (TV, 9 March); Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood (film, 11 March); Bad Vegan: Fame. Fraud.

In Joe vs Carole, Exotic is played by John Cameron Mitchell and Baskin by Kate McKinnon. At one point a different take on the story was set to be produced by Amazon, with Nicolas Cage in the role of Joe Exotic. Now that would have been something to see. Those who want to watch Cage play a dodgy dude who loves large cats can check out the entertaining 2019 film Primal, featuring the great actor delivering lines such as: “I just spent 10 months in the jungle, and this all smells like cat shit to me.” Film, US, 2016 – out 20 March We know all the feeling: you come home from work, totally pooped, and all you want to do is slump on the couch and watch a film about a farting corpse. In this strange black comedy, Daniel Radcliffe plays a dead (albeit flatulent) man with relish. This one-of-a-kind (for better or worse) film follows Paul Dano, who is stranded on a beach and befriends said corpse when it washes up on a shore.

Film, US, 2022 – out 18 March There isn’t a lot coming to Prime Video this month, but there is this erotic thriller starring Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas as a married couple who play mind games with each other in a plot filled with murder, infidelity and twists. I know what you’re thinking: that’s all pretty familiar. And yet this film has a couple of distinguishing factors. The first: Deep Water was adapted from a novel by the great Patricia Highsmith, whose books have provided the foundation for classic films such as Strangers on a Train and The Talented Mr Ripley. The second: it’s the first film for 20 years from Adrian Lyne, who directed some hit erotic thrillers from the 1990s –namely Indecent Proposal, Fatal Attraction and 9 ½ Weeks.

TV, Australia, 2022 – out 8 March Australian musicals are few and far between – and I’m pretty sure we’ve never had one about buying a home. The funny folk from The Feed team up with songwriter and comedian Tom Cardy for this spritzy musical, in which a couple of millennials (Vic Zerbst and Jenna Owen), fed up with rent and roommates, decide to take the plunge and purchase their own property. This means they must confront several inevitable horrors, including mortgage brokers and older rival buyers, who they fear will “buy it with their boomer gold!” The musical genre is a tough one to get right, but this 35-minute production directed by David Harmon is a pleasure to watch. The time, so to speak, flies by. TV, UK, 2022 – out 16 March Police dramas are a dime a dozen, but they don’t all get reviews like this five-part Martin Freeman-led series about a troubled cop attempting to save a young drug addict. This five-star review from our own Lucy Mangan called it “fast and riveting”; the Spectator observed the show’s “overwhelming air of authenticity”; and the Standard said it “feels like a contender for the best police drama of the year”.

Film, Australia, 2022 – out 2 March As I noted in my review, Australia’s self-professed “queen of honky tonk”, Wanita Bahtiyar, is what they call “good talent” in documentary land: a charming, albeit rough and rowdy country music singer who commands the screen and stage. Director Matthew Walker’s very entertaining film follows Bahtiyar to America, where she plans to record a full country music album. Film, Australia, 2020 – out 8 March There’s a fist-pumping energy in Catherine Dwyer’s well-paced documentary about the women’s liberation in Australia during the 1960s and 1970s: it’s one of those films that makes you want to whip up some placards and take to the streets. There are familiar documentary elements – talking heads, faded photographs and grainy archival footage – but despite the film’s reliance on old materials, it still feels fresh.

TV, US, 2022 – out 3 March Amanda Seyfried is an impressive actor, with a fine sense of control and an ability to shift tones unpredictably. Sometimes she projects warmth and innocence; sometimes – as is the case in this series about tech entrepreneur, billionaire and convicted fraudster Elizabeth Holmes – she has eerie cunning and coldness. Holmes founded the now-defunct tech company Theranos and spruiked a revolutionary medical device that never really worked. Seyfried is the best thing about The Dropout, which is scrambled chronologically in a way that jars. It also seems unsure what it wants to be, reducing its corporate thriller elements (where it would have been most effective) in favour of a broader picture of Holmes’ life. TV, US, 2022 – out 30 March Having endlessly rehashed the stories of countless big-name Marvel characters, from Spider-Man to Iron Man to Doctor Strange to Black Widow etcetera etcetera etcetera, Disney are now rummaging through the vaults and plucking out characters most people have never heard of. Enter Moon Knight (Oscar Isaac), the superhero alter ego of a former mercenary with dissociative identity disorder, who grapples with his powers as cult leader Arthur Harrow (Ethan Hawke) encourages him to “embrace the chaos”. Part of that chaos is Isaac’s choice to perform one of Spector’s identities with an unconventional British accent, amusingly described by Stuart Heritage as sounding like “an 18th-century Leicestershire grandmother.” I for one welcome our new granny-sounding cape-wearing overlord. Film, UK/US, 1985 – out 25 March It would be remiss of me to not mention one of my favourite films: Terry Gilliam’s astonishing sci-fi satire about a daydreaming government employee (Jonathan Pryce) who goes mad, in a dystopian future world so riddled with bureaucracy that people die on the street after being covered with too much paperwork. Gilliam fills out this absurd albeit chilling universe in idiosyncratic visual detail, infusing it with an intensely hallucinogenic atmosphere.

TV, US, 2022 – out 3 March Creator David Jenkin’s pirate-themed period comedy is funny, if a little one-note, from the start, with Rhys Darby’s Captain Stede Bonnet declaring “what we’re about to do is perilous. Very perilous.” Bonnet – a real figure from history – is played here as a well-meaning nincompoop, attempting to manage a cynical crew who don’t respect his authority; in other words, it is Murray from Flight of the Conchords in pantaloons. Having only watched the pilot, directed by Taika Waititi, I’m curious to see if the show can sustain itself for an entire series.

3/3/2022,"Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that causes widespread muscle pain and tenderness. It is often accompanied by fatigue, altered sleep, cognitive disturbance and emotional distress. It usually develops in middle adulthood and affects more women than men. In Australia, fibromyalgia affects 2% to 5% of the population. An exercise physiologist, Sarah Comensoli, says many people with fibromyalgia worry exercise will make their pain worse. That concern is reasonable – it isn’t uncommon that people with fibromyalgia experience more post-workout pain and tiredness when they first begin exercising. “Exercise induces fatigue,” says Prof Geoffrey Littlejohn, a rheumatologist at the department of medicine at Monash University. “It’s a bit of a catch-22, that one of the most effective treatments can aggravate the symptoms of the condition, at least initially.” The combination of pain, fatigue, and inactivity often leads to weak and deconditioned muscles, making ordinary daily activities challenging. But research has shown that exercise can alleviate symptoms. “It’s one of the most proven treatments for fibromyalgia,” Littlejohn says. Comensolisi says: “Exercise helps people maintain and improve their functional capacity. If you get into a good routine, that might also improve sleep duration and quality.” Exercise can also boost mood and resilience. “A lot of people with fibromyalgia experience a loss of control,” Littlejohn says. “Exercise puts that back in their own hands.” Before starting any exercise routine, get advice from your doctor or physiotherapist. They can suggest safe exercises tailored to your condition and ability. According to Littlejohn, people with fibromyalgia can benefit from hydrotherapy because the water supports their body. “You can do more things than you can on land without causing too much stirring up of the pain.” Exercising in a warm pool can offer multiple benefits. The water’s buoyancy relieves stress on the joints, and the warmth helps tight muscles relax. A gentle water workout in the hydrotherapy pool, usually at a temperature of 34C, can reduce stiffness and alleviate muscle spasms, resulting in greater flexibility and range of motion. Comensoli warns that people should still assess the classes they want to attend. “A lot of group classes run for 45 to 60 minutes, and that can be too much for some people.” “One thing we love people to remain able to do for a long time is getting up off a chair without their hands,” says Comensoli. “That’s how you get off your couch, get off the toilet, get out of your car. If you can do that, then life is going to be a little bit easier.” To help the body maintain such function, Comensoli suggests strengthening the glutes and leg muscles with a pilates-style bridge exercise. Comensoli says a few repetitions of the bridge exercise might be a good starting point. “Simply starting with some mobility exercises to get the legs moving, then go up to do strength work.” “We’re trying to encourage gentle movement that the body can cope with, but then we progress over time.” Regular aerobic exercise that gets the heart beating a little faster can improve fitness and help with pain and fatigue. Aerobic activities include walking, swimming, cycling and dancing. None of these is necessarily better than the others, but it’s best to do something you enjoy, says Comensoli. She says walking is a great activity to start breaking up sedentary time. It is accessible to most and can be easily paced according to abilities. “Walking is great if they like being outside. It might also be a way to socialise – walking with a friend might be great.” People with fibromyalgia can experience pain very quickly because their pain system is over-sensitive and reacts to minimal activity. Some people can develop high pain tolerance and push through pain. But when this happens, their pain system becomes even more sensitive, so they might experience pain sooner next time. Pushing through pain might send a “threat” or “danger” signal to the brain. The brain interprets the signal as a “need for protection”, and its way of protecting the body is to make pain. “Don’t push towards maximal fitness too quickly.” “My philosophy is not to put any activity in the ‘never, ever’ category,” says Comensoli. She says no specific exercise must be avoided, but the level of activity must be tailored to the individual’s condition and abilities.",Lifestyle/Life and style,How to move: exercising with fibromyalgia,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/03/how-to-move-exercising-with-fibromyalgia
3/3/2022,"The Australian Christian Lobby has criticised the prime minister for saying visa applications from Ukrainian people are at “the top of the pile”, asking what message this sends to people “fleeing the horrors of the Taliban in Afghanistan”. Amid a high volume of applications from Afghan nationals, the Morrison government is under pressure to expand the number of places in Australia’s humanitarian program, which is currently set at 13,750 per year. The government is now weighing up how best to support those fleeing Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, signalling it is looking at a range of visa categories. One option is adopting a similar scheme to that Australia introduced for those fleeing Kosovo, where temporary visas were given. Scott Morrison said on Tuesday it would be wrong to assume Ukrainians would not want to return home after the war. The UN estimates 660,000 people have already fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries over the past week of the conflict. The Australian Christian Lobby, which is influential with members of the Coalition and had a role in shaping the government’s stance on the religious discrimination bill, called for Australia to increase its overall humanitarian intake. Wendy Francis, the national director of politics at the ACL, said she welcomed Morrison’s commitment to offer Ukrainians entry to Australia through the family, skilled and student visa programs. But the ACL was concerned by the prime minister’s recent statement that he had instructed the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, to put visa applications from Ukrainians “to the top of the pile”. “By ‘go to the top of the pile’, what does this say in regards to those fleeing the horrors of the Taliban in Afghanistan?” Francis told Guardian Australia. She said that Australia’s immigration intake had been low for the past two years, leaving “a lot of room to take more people fleeing conflict and the world’s most desperate and pressing humanitarian crisis, which is in Afghanistan”. “We don’t need a pile. We can continue to offer shelter to those fleeing the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, as well as processing visa applications swiftly from Ukraine citizens.” As of January, the Department of Home Affairs had received more than 32,500 applications for the humanitarian program from Afghan nationals on behalf of more than 145,000 individuals. In mid-February officials told a Senate committee 55,000 Afghan nationals had been certified as having made lawful applications to date, but only 1,000 of them had been granted permanent places. Processing was continuing. Morrison has said the government would be “prepared to take more and more [Ukrainians], as we have with Afghanistan”. But Francis said Australia had “still not given places to Afghanistan refugees over and above our regular intake”. The government announced in January it would provide at least 15,000 places for Afghan nationals through the humanitarian and family visa program – but this commitment was spread over four years, and not in addition to the existing overall intake. The annual humanitarian intake was cut in 2020 from 18,750 places to 13,750. It is understood the government believes the 13,750 annual figure remains about the right level, but it is has not ruled out increasing the numbers. Francis said the ACL wanted the government to “restore the places in our humanitarian aid program”, as the reduction should not “evolve into a budgetary saving”. This month’s budget should deliver increased assistance to people from Afghanistan and Ukraine, she said. “People’s lives are on the line. The need is urgent now.” The Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Nick McKim, said an additional 20,000 places should be made available to Afghan refugees, above Australia’s existing intake. “Given Australia’s culpability in occupying and destabilising Afghanistan, it is the very least that we can do,” McKim said. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, denied that putting applications from Ukraine to the top of the pile meant forgetting Afghanistan. “Absolutely not,” Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday. “We’re not looking to put them [Afghan nationals] down the pile. What we’re looking to do is work simultaneously bringing people from conflict zones like Afghanistan while responding to what is a very severe humanitarian challenge in Ukraine and neighbouring Poland.” Frydenberg signalled the government was considering expanding support, saying it was “very concerned by the humanitarian impacts of this crisis” and would make “further announcements in due course”. Morrison discussed the situation with Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, in a phone call on Wednesday evening. Just spoke with Polish PM @MorawieckiM. Praised Poland’s resilience helping those fleeing war in Ukraine, discussed Australia’s humanitarian & military support & the broader implications of the Ukraine situation. On the 50th anniversary of relations, our ties are even stronger. pic.twitter.com/cePX6KpIgH Labor’s home affairs spokesperson, Kristina Keneally, said the unfolding security and humanitarian crisis was “devastating for the people of Ukraine and for the Ukrainian-Australian community”. Keneally said the opposition would consider any proposals from the government, but called for it to act quickly. “Unfortunately, the Morrison-Joyce government waited months before making clear what steps it would take to help Afghan asylum seekers, and today many are still uncertain about their applications for protection in Australia,” Keneally said. Guardian Australia asked the Department of Home Affairs to provide an update on how many applications from Afghan nationals had been processed, how it would ensure focus was not taken off that cohort, and whether it had increased visa processing staff in light of the Afghanistan and Ukraine crises. The department responded that it was “progressing outstanding visa applications from Ukrainian nationals as a priority, across all visa categories” and had “finalised hundreds of on-hand visa applications over recent days”. But a spokesperson for the department said Afghan citizens were being prioritised for processing within Australia’s humanitarian program. “The visa response to the situation in Ukraine continues to be focussed on the skilled, family, student and temporary entry streams,” a department spokesperson said. “Consideration of humanitarian support options will be undertaken in conjunction with key partners to provide targeted support, including UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration.” In 2015, the Abbott government’s offer to take 12,000 refugees from the conflict in Syria and Iraq was in addition to the pre-existing humanitarian intake, meaning that they were genuinely new places.",News/Australia news,Australian Christian Lobby criticises Scott Morrison for saying Ukrainians at ‘top of pile’ for visas,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/australian-christian-lobby-criticises-scott-morrison-for-saying-ukrainians-at-top-of-pile-for-visas
3/3/2022,"A 40,000-year-old archaeological site in northern China has unearthed the earliest evidence of ochre processing in east Asia, researchers say. The site was discovered at Xiamabei in the Nihewan Basin, in the northern Chinese province of Hebei. Ochre pieces and tools found in the area suggest that the clay earth pigment was processed there, via grinding and pounding, to produce powders of different colours and grain sizes. Near lumps of ochre, archaeologists unearthed a hammer stone as well as a flat limestone slab that showed signs of battering. In a study published in the journal Nature, the team has dated the artefacts between 39,000 and 41,000 years old. Prof Michael Petraglia of Griffith University, a co-author of the study, said the site was unlike anything uncovered in east Asia. “This site doesn’t fit with anything we know,” he said. “It’s got unique cultural characteristics to it.” The site also contained 382 stone tool artefacts, mainly made of chert and quartz. Petraglia said the artefacts appeared to have been created by striking flakes off small pebbles, resulting in blade-like tools. They predate microlith technology – specialised stone blades that have been found in northern China, Russia and Japan – by 10,000 years. The researchers believe the site was most likely inhabited by Homo sapiens, but don’t rule out possibility of occupation by other hominins such as Denisovans or Neanderthals. “There could have been a lot of interbreeding, and therefore we’re dealing with populations that are different both biologically and culturally at 40,000 years ago,” Petraglia said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ochre has previously been found in sites associated with Homo sapiens in Africa. A 100,000-year-old processing workshop was discovered in a cave in South Africa in 2008. “Our species seems to be engaging with this material a lot,” Petraglia said. The researchers believe the ochre could have been used for symbolic purposes, such as for body adornment, or as a binding agent in adhesives. Petraglia described the Xiamabei discovery as “a potential signpost of a migration event of our species”. Evidence has previously suggested that modern humans first migrated from Africa into Eurasia about 60,000 years ago. However, a discovery of human remains in southern China, dated at between 80,000 to 120,000 years old, has recently thrown this timeline into debate. The Xiamabei discovery adds to the archaeological significance of the Nihewan Basin. Archaeologists and palaeontologists are able to study rock layers there that date from the present day to almost 200m years ago. “This is a very unique place in Asia,” Petraglia said. “We’ve identified, in a sense, a new culture coming out of there.”",News/Science,"‘A new culture’: discovery in China reveals ochre processing in east Asia up to 41,000 years ago",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/03/a-new-culture-discovery-in-china-reveals-ochre-processing-in-east-asia-up-to-41000-years-ago
3/3/2022,"Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, has warned confidentiality agreements to settle sexual harassment claims can allow perpetrators to continue or even escalate abuses of power, while preventing victims from accessing proper support. Jenkins told a webinar organised by the Australian Institute of Company Directors on Wednesday confidentiality agreements in harassment cases should not be banned altogether, but they should not be standard practice either. The sex discrimination commissioner said she had deployed confidentiality clauses routinely in her professional life as a corporate lawyer, but the Harvey Weinstein case had delivered a “lightbulb moment” for her. “The Weinstein thing really exposed that – if you’ve got a really good system of non-disclosure agreements, then someone can proceed, that was at the extreme, but it’s true, to be raping people,” Jenkins told Wednesday’s event. She said confidentiality clauses also isolated victims. Jenkins said she had spoken to victims who felt they could not discuss their trauma with anyone, including people “who had been harassed in the past, they had subsequently got married and had never told their husband – it is that crazy”. “There was this silence, even if you needed help you weren’t talking to anyone [out of] fear. That is ridiculous.” She said people drafting settlements were treating the resolution of a dispute as “a commercial transaction … treating it as if, well, I’ll give you money and you’ll give me silence”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Jenkins called for a change of mindset. She said perpetrators permitted to remain anonymous could develop a sense of impunity, and this created risks for colleagues in the future. “Some of these settlements, like Weinstein, [are] serial offenders continu[ing] on, with glowing references, and [confidential settlements] allowed them to continue”. Jenkins said confidential settlements were highly problematic in a corporate setting because boards were often out of the loop about inappropriate behaviour in their organisation. She said sexual harassment was incredibly prevalent in Australia. Jenkins said boards needed to be much more proactive to ensure they were providing proper governance and oversight. Jenkins said boards were in a position to assess the potential risks by understanding the characteristics of their industry. She said work she had undertaken for the Australian Human Rights Commission, including a landmark review of parliamentary culture in 2021, had established common characteristics that elevated the risks of workplace incidents. She said waiting for complaints to surface was completely inadequate. Boards should ask for information about non-disclosure agreements in the corporation, and it could be prudent to ask for a risk assessment to identify any high-risk environments. “Boards have a view that we can’t regulate culture, that this is a management issue, that HR should be dealing with this,” Jenkins said. “The time has come for this hands-off approach by boards to end. Boards are central to the change required”. Jenkins said some firms were allowing employees to make anonymous complaints through cultural surveys, and that information was valuable to understand the culture in an organisation.",News/Australia news,"Weinstein case showed non-disclosure clauses can allow abusers to continue, says Kate Jenkins",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/weinstein-case-showed-non-disclosure-clauses-can-allow-abusers-to-continue-says-kate-jenkins
3/3/2022,"Yes, there is something we can do. Something that, even if small, is meaningful. The propaganda war has always been crucial to Vladimir Putin. He uses floods of disinformation to confuse and misdirect people overseas and bolster support at home. The Kremlin knows that every action requires an apparatus of justification. Russia cannot continue its costly war without the consent of its troops and many other citizens. Putin’s troll factories are notorious for turning out misleading claims, but their power is limited by their lack of credibility. What serves him well, as a study by Cardiff University’s crime and security research institute suggests, are “organic comments”: statements by real people, repeating and amplifying his propaganda. These are liked or upvoted by his bots then reproduced in Russian media to create the impression that he has widespread overseas support. Obviously, real people have a right to express their opinions, however mistaken. But, given their utility to the Russian disinformation machine, I believe we have a duty to debunk and contest misleading justifications. In doing so we could, in our very small way, help the resistance in Ukraine. This puts me in a difficult place. Among the worst disseminators of Kremlin propaganda in the UK are people with whom I have, in the past, shared platforms and made alliances. The grim truth is that, for years, a segment of the “anti-imperialist” left has been recycling and amplifying Putin’s falsehoods. This segment is by no means representative: many other leftists have staunchly and consistently denounced Russian imperialism, just as they rightly denounce the imperialism of the US and UK. But it is, I think, an important one. At the end of last year, the writer and film-maker John Pilger claimed “it was the US that overthrew the elected govt in Ukraine in 2014, allowing Nato to march right up to Russia’s western border”. This is a standard Kremlin talking point, dismissing the revolution as a US coup. Ukraine, of course, is not a Nato member. Outrageously, in my view, he maintains that on the day of the invasion, “Putin reportedly offered peace if Ukraine embraced neutrality and rejected Nato’s arms”. It is hard to see how Putin’s demand for surrender could be interpreted as a genuine peace offer. As Russian tanks rolled across the border, Pilger asked us to “imagine a strategic enclave of Britons, or French, or Germans, or Americans under violent siege – shelled and terrorised – for eight years”. This seemed to echo Putin’s speech the previous night: “The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime”. The BBC reports that Pilger’s claims have been widely shared by accounts spreading Russian propaganda. I see the Stop the War coalition’s letter of 18 February, signed by many fine and eminent people, as strangely unbalanced. It stated that it “opposes any war over Ukraine”, but said nothing about Russian aggression. It appeared to blame only Nato and the British government, and urged “the entire anti-war movement to unite on the basis of challenging the British government’s aggressive posturing and direct its campaigning to that end above all”. The coalition has recently produced a map showing Crimea, following its illegal annexation, as part of Russia. Its deputy president, Andrew Murray, has claimed it’s a myth that Ukraine wants peace. He has also reproduced a classic Kremlin falsehood: that in Ukraine, “Russian has been banned from the public sphere”. Fiona Edwards, a member of the coalition’s steering committee, has insisted that “Nato is the aggressor, not Russia”. There is a strong argument that Nato should have been disbanded at the end of the cold war. But while Putin’s sense of threat seems to have been heightened by Nato expansion and mission creep, Nato expansion has also been driven in part by Putin’s belligerence. Are we really to believe that Estonia and Latvia joined because they wanted to attack Russia? On the contrary, it’s because they fear attack. While Nato’s growth is likely to have contributed to the crisis, it’s ridiculous to suggest that Russia is not the aggressor. The former Labour MP Chris Williamson goes even further. As Putin’s tanks rolled across the border last Thursday, he characterised the government of Ukraine as a “post-coup, neo-Nazi backed, corrupt regime”, a classic Kremlin smear. The Morning Star, to give one of many similar examples, falsely describes Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s administration as a “fascist government”. Harmful as this propaganda is, leftist support for another of Putin’s projects has even more serious implications. Since Russia threw its weight behind Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria in 2015, “anti-imperialists” in western nations have, unwittingly or not, helped to airbrush some of the world’s worst atrocities. Pilger, the late Robert Fisk and the celebrated journalist Seymour Hersh have all helped undermine well-attested reports of Assad’s use of chemical weapons. As Peter Tatchell has explained in the Independent, the Stop the War coalition has taken a bizarrely one-sided approach to the conflict, focusing its anger on the US, though the great majority of atrocities have been perpetrated by the Assad government and its Russian backers. A group of professors at UK universities, who call themselves the Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media, has helped spread extremely dangerous, unsubstantiated claims about the White Helmets: a rescue force that pulls people out of the rubble after airstrikes in Syria. One member of the working group, a professor of genetics at Edinburgh University called Paul McKeigue, has suggested that the White Helmets might have staged “managed massacres”, perhaps involving captives “killed in some improvised gas chamber”, whose bodies they then spread on the ground. I see such conspiracy theories as a kind of leftwing QAnon. McKeigue also revealed to an investigator posing as a Russian intelligence officer, with whom he thought he was collaborating, that he had been liaising with Russian embassy staff in both the UK and the Netherlands. False information about Syria is also widely recirculated by Kremlin bots and used to justify Assad’s attacks. It is likely to have real-world impacts, as it reduces the political cost of the regime’s atrocities. Careless talk costs lives. True anti-imperialism means opposing not only the west’s imperialism, essential as this is. It’s about opposing all imperialism, whether western, Russian, Chinese or other. It’s about opposing all aggressive wars, regardless of who wages them. It’s about resisting the temptation to believe that your enemy’s enemy must be your friend.
