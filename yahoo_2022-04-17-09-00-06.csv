4/17/2022,"Russia’s Defense Ministry released a brief video on Saturday of the head of the Navy meeting with crew members of the sunken warship Moskva, as social media posts have surfaced that appear to confirm at least one death on board. In a 26-second video—the first public appearance of the crew since Moscow admitted the country’s most powerful battleship had sunk—Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov is seen meeting with crew members in Sevastopol. About 100 sailors can be seen, although at least 500 were on board at the time the ship went down after Ukrainian officials said they successfully struck it with at least one Neptune missile. Moscow, which admitted the ship had been “badly damaged” but blamed it on an explosion of ammunition on board, has claimed all crew members were rescued without providing any details on their whereabouts after the disaster. Ukrainian authorities have said some of the crew of the ship that was famously told, “Go fuck yourself” by a Ukrainian serviceman did not survive. At least one crew member appears to have been publicly mourned on the Russian networking site Odnoklassniki, according to a Saturday report by the Ukrainian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. In a post by a woman identified as his widow, Ivan Vakhrushev was said to have “died fulfilling his duty” on the ship. “He fought to his last breath for the life of the ship,” the post read. The news outlet reports that the woman, Varvara Vakhrusheva, confirmed in follow-up correspondence that her husband, who was responsible for the ship’s operational safety, died on board. “They discovered his body,” she was quoted telling the outlet, adding that she had been informed by military command. At least 27 other crew members of the ship were still unaccounted for, she said. Russia’s Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said in a statement on Telegram on Saturday that all crew members of the ship would “continue to serve in the Navy,” but did not comment on the fate of the hundreds of sailors who appeared to be missing from the Sevastopol photo-op.

4/17/2022,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - NATO member Romania has grounded its remaining fleet of military MiG 21 LanceR jets as of Friday given their ""considerably high accident rate"", and will speed up a planned purchase of second-hand F-16s from Norway, the defence ministry said. The move was unrelated to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which shares a 650-kilometre (400 mile) border with Romania. Romania will continue to fly its small fleet of F-16 fighter jets acquired from Portugal, the ministry said, while allied states also have jets deployed to the country for enhanced air policing missions as part of NATO efforts to boost its eastern flank, especially after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Romania bought its first F-16 jets from Portugal in 2016 as it works to phase out its communist-era MiGs. The ministry said it would speed up the process to buy an additional 32 F-16 jets from Norway, which will give it an additional two air squadrons. ""The available resources of the aircrafts from the three squadrons ensure ... their operation for a minimum of 10 years and will form an air capability of transition to fifth-generation F-35 jets,"" the ministry said. The last accident involving a MiG 21 took place in early March when a jet on air patrol crashed, killing the pilot. Seven soldiers sent to find him on a search-and-rescue helicopter mission also died in a separate crash. Romania, a NATO member since 2004, plans to raise defence spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product next year from 2% at present, President Klaus Iohannis said in March. The country currently hosts over 3,000 NATO troops and will have a permanent alliance battlegroup stationed on its territory. More than 714,000 Ukrainian refugees have crossed the border into Romania since Russia began what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
