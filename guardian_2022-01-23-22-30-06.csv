1/23/2022,"A Florida man has pleaded guilty to threatening to kill Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi, two leading Democrats in Congress, and Kim Foxx, a prominent district attorney in Illinois.  The US attorney’s office for the southern district of Florida said Paul Vernon Hoeffer, 60, entered his plea in federal court in Fort Pierce on Friday. Hoeffer admitted calling Pelosi’s Washington office in March 2019, threatening “to come a ‘long, long, way’ to rattle her head with bullets and cut her head off”. He admitted a call to Foxx on the same day, saying bullets would “rattle her brain”. In November 2020, Hoeffer called the office of Ocasio-Cortez, a leading progressive from New York. This time, the DoJ said, Hoeffer “threatened that he would ‘rip her head off’, and told her to sleep with one eye open”. Citing the plea agreement, NBC News reported that Hoeffer also “warned of ‘all-out war’ and a ‘civilian army’” and made racist remarks in his call to Foxx. Hoeffer made his calls before the attack on the US Capitol on January 6 2021, in which supporters of Donald Trump sought to overturn his election defeat. Some looked for lawmakers to capture or kill. One rioter, from Texas, faces charges including a threat to “assassinate” Ocasio-Cortez. His case has yet to be tried. Capitol police have reported an increase in threats against lawmakers. NBC cited the chief of Capitol police, J Thomas Manger, as saying there were around 9,600 threats in 2021, up from more than 8,000 in 2020. As prominent Democratic women, Ocasio-Cortez and Pelosi are common targets for threats, from within the walls of Congress as well as without. Ocasio-Cortez was elected in 2018, as Democrats took the House in opposition to Trump. She quickly became a national star. In 2019, Time magazine began a profile by describing nerves in her Washington office. “Every 10 minutes or so,” the magazine said, “someone knocks on the big wooden door of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s office on Capitol Hill. The noise makes staffers stiffen. “It’s almost always a harmless fan, one of dozens who arrive each day, leaving neon-colored Post-it notes as devotional offerings. “But in her first three months in Congress, aides say, enough people have threatened to murder Ocasio-Cortez that Capitol police trained her staff to perform risk assessments of her visitors.” This, the magazine said, was “the daily reality for America’s newest human Rorschach test. Wonder Woman of the left, Wicked Witch of the right”. At sentencing in April, Hoeffer will face up to 15 years in prison.",News/US news,Florida man pleads guilty to threatening to kill Ocasio-Cortez and Pelosi,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/23/florida-man-pleads-guilty-threats-kill-aoc-nancy-pelosi

1/23/2022,"Like many of my millennial peers, I believed that I would be stuck in a doom-loop of precarious housing for ever, handing over huge portions of my income every month to a landlord who happened to own the floor I was sleeping on. Across many countries, and big cities in particular, the prospect of homeownership or access to socially rented housing is a pipe dream. Median house prices have risen to more than seven times median incomes in the Anglo-Saxon economies. In the UK, the proportion of 25- to 35-year-olds on middle incomes who owned a home plummeted from two-thirds to just one-quarter between 1996 and 2016. Meanwhile, the costs of renting, from Sydney to San Francisco, have soared.  Then, in July 2021, I moved with my Danish partner into one of Copenhagen’s many andelsboliger, a cooperatively owned block of flats where we neither have a landlord nor pay rent, and which is not subject to market prices. Today, about 7% of the Danish population live in a form of cooperatively owned housing – and it accounts for one-third of the housing stock in Copenhagen. It soon became clear to me that there’s a lot that other countries could learn. Rather than buy an apartment, people who live in andelsboliger purchase a share in an association that owns the apartment building, equal to the value of the apartment. The prices of the 158 apartments that make up our cooperative have not increased much since it was founded in 1975, meaning we could afford the deposit and subsequent mortgage instalments without support from our parents – even though we together were earning below the median income when we moved in. We don’t expect to make money on our apartment in the time that we live here, but we aren’t losing anything through rent payments either. If we move out, we will leave with roughly what we have put in over the years. As members of the cooperative, we not only have an apartment to live in and a garden to share with our neighbours, but also a voice in decisions about how the building and our common spaces, like the launderette, are run. Once a year, we elect fellow residents to the cooperative’s board, who become responsible for overseeing building maintenance, responding to emergencies, and the administration of new households moving in. The andelsbolig system has its roots in the wider Danish cooperative movement, which began in farming and consumer goods in the 19th century. In the postwar decades, housing cooperatives flourished with the support of trade union groups and social democratic governments. In the 1970s, a legal reform was introduced that granted tenants in the private rental sector the right of “first choice” to collectively buy their building if a landlord wanted to sell it, and by the 2000s thousands of andelsboliger had been established in this way across the country, including the one we live in. For many years, andelsbolig apartments offered an affordable means of housing that provided security, autonomy and community for hundreds of thousands of people. But since the early 2000s, broader changes in the housing market and in finance have put pressure on the system. Cooperatives like ours, which has mostly maintained the financial and social structures it was founded with, are increasingly hard to come by. Like the capitals of its western European neighbours, the private sector housing market in Copenhagen is in crisis. House prices have soared in the country over the past 20 years owing to a combination of tax reforms, mortgage liberalisation policies, and homeownership incentives, also driving up the costs of renting. The increased demand for the more affordable andelsboliger may be exacerbating problems of race- and class-based exclusion in some cooperatives, which have come to rely solely on internal networks to find new tenants rather than external waiting lists. There is also anecdotal evidence that under-the-table payments are offered and accepted to secure cooperative shares. Marketising reforms to the andelsbolig system itself have further undermined the principles on which it was founded – and even led to the dissolution of many cooperatives. Legislation that prevented boards from increasing the price of apartments above the founding amount has largely been repealed and, over the years, many cooperatives have voted to hike the value of shares, enriching existing members while rendering membership more expensive for newcomers. There are also instances where boards have inadvertently run their cooperative into the ground, owing to financial mismanagement in the absence of meaningful government protection. In recent years, cooperatives have even come to be seen as a promising investment opportunity for real estate companies, pension funds and financial institutions. The rapid transformation of the andelsbolig system at large over the past 20 years suggests that alternative forms of housing in other cities would also struggle to survive, as long as there are powerful financial interests that can extract ever-growing rents from tenancies and price increases in the private housing sector. In other words, the experience in Copenhagen supports the economist Josh Ryan-Collins’s contention that western Europe’s housing crisis cannot be solved while housing remains primarily a financial asset, instead of a source of shelter. The principles on which the first andelsboliger were founded, and the sense of freedom that they provide, are nonetheless worth fighting for. Not so long ago, I had lived in 10 different houses within the space of five years, sometimes moving for work or study, but mostly because the landlord had decided to up the rent to an unaffordable amount or sell the apartment. Back then, my home was not something I had any control over. But my housing cooperative in Copenhagen has proved to me that it doesn’t have to be this way. Housing can be, and should be, a path to joy and mental peace, to autonomy and community. These conditions, and not the potential for financial extraction, should be at the heart of housing for everyone.

Not only are they two members lighter – it’s now a solo vehicle for occasional actor Olly Alexander (It’s a Sin) – but that second album’s convoluted conceptual framework has been shaken off in favour of 14 sweat-soaked bangers that focus on pent-up carnal desires. “Give me it now,” Alexander purrs on the undulating Intimacy, a classy tale of lust that suggests a hotel was involved (“tie me to a four-poster,” he requests). The pulsating Crave and the cheeky Muscle (“don’t want to leave without your body”) drag the listener on to sticky nightclub floors. Sex is also explored on 20 Minutes, with its urgent need for pleasure after months of isolation played out over a keening, surprisingly delicate melody.  All that transience throws up its own problems, however, with Sweet Talker – a disappointingly lightweight slither of dance-pop playlist catnip – mourning a lack of honesty.

1/23/2022,"Alifesize trompe l’oeil painting of the real-life lift at Camden Arts Centre opens this exhibition by the Canadian artist Allison Katz. Its doors are agape, revealing a deep silver box within. Its metal sheen gives the work a sense of photorealism, but it’s the 3D depth that implores you to step inside. It’s a fitting welcome for a show entitled Artery; the lift instantly stirs up thoughts of transportation, liminality and portals. Katz, 41, was born in Montreal and now lives in London. Her whimsical work, thematically fluid and exploring the conventions of traditional painting, has seen her become a rising figure in contemporary art. She was shortlisted for the Max Mara art prize for women in 2020 and featured in last year’s acclaimed Mixing It Up: Painting Today show at the Hayward Gallery. Artery, previously at Nottingham Contemporary, is Katz’s first solo UK exhibition, and arrives with bags full of her favourite recurring tropes and motifs: monkeys, eggs and more.  Katz has a thing about cockerels. In The Cockfather, a chicken’s body has been restructured to the shape of a dish that holds three eggs, a comical rumination. There are also lots of cabbages. She paints them in varying luminous green shades and sits them upright on tables. At the side of each veiny vegetable is the silhouette of a man’s face. They’re pretty images, but the joke is in working out what they are. Are these actually still lifes or portraits of the artist’s shy partner? Katz’s strange and mischievous storytelling recalls Paula Rego; the cabbage in The Artist in Her Studio by Rego comes to mind. Cabbages lack the pop-cultural currency of avocados, but they are significant in the history of painting. Leonora Carrington and Stanley Spencer both painted them. Perhaps this explains Katz’s interest? There’s an inherent humour in Katz’s paintings; everything is glazed with a sense of trickery, works like banana peels waiting to trip you up. Blue and gold brushstrokes make a face, reminiscent of Matisse’s visage paintings, in Akgraph (Tobias + Angel), but closer inspection reveals that the eyes, nose and mouth spell out the word “mask” – Katz’s initials (Ms Allison Sarah Katz). A small dog, fish skeleton and birds encircle the face, all of which sit atop a foggy, reimagined Tobias and the Angel, a 15th-century altar painting by Andrea del Verrocchio. Ceaselessly playing with illusion and perception, Katz’s dreamlike works exist somewhere between the fantastic and the familiar. Some paintings are detailed, like Posterchild, a collage of random images akin to the experience of online scrolling. Others are basic and unfussy, which can be jarring. Someone Else’s Dream, depicting a naked man in a field of bulls, feels unspirited and lacks the energy present in the surrounding works. Katz is at her best when layering ideas. One series of works is painted from the vantage point of a throat, so that teeth and gums frame the subject. MASK is a self-portrait from a Miu Miu advert that Katz starred in last year. It’s interesting to see the mouth presented as a tool of observation. If these works form their own vascular system, it isn’t obvious where the heart is. Her primary interest is in art itself and the conventions and power of painting. That isn’t to say this is a show devoid of epiphanies, but it’s futile to read into it too deeply. Much more fun to just give in to the bizarre. In the adjacent gallery, works by the French-Caribbean artist Julien Creuzet are on display in his first major UK show since winning Camden Art Centre’s emerging artist prize at the 2019 Frieze art fair. Creuzet, 34, grew up in Martinique and now lives in Paris. His practice encompasses sculpture, wall-based works and digital films, but here, it’s free-standing and suspended sculptures that take precedence. From the show’s lengthy title alone – “Too blue, too deep, too dark we sank, meandering every moving limb. In the den, in the womb. Too bèlè, too gwo-ka, too biguine, too compas, too kadans, too calypso, too mazurka, too makossa, in my joyful sadness (...)” – it’s clear that Creuzet is preoccupied with language (Derek Walcott and Linton Kwesi Johnson feature in the reading list of the exhibition’s File Notes). Though more poetic than expository, the title does hint at the show’s themes: the sea, musicality, the Caribbean, colonisation. Blistering reds, greens and yellows are the first thing to strike you, especially on an icy January day. Creuzet turns the space into a kaleidoscope of colours and patterns, but it’s the twisted configurations of the sculptures that are the most compelling; they look like relatives in conversation with each other. All these asymmetrical forms, resembling everything from knobbly skeletal bones and architectural frameworks to coats of armour, are made from found objects – plastic, metal, wiring, rope, carpet, synthetic plants and torn fabric. It’s hard not to see Creuzet’s work as symbolic renderings of Caribbean islands whose histories overlap but whose postcolonial identities are still distinctive. We derive from it…, a large suspended sculpture whose shape reflects the insignia on various Caribbean flags, is engrossing, but these works function better when viewed as a collection. Drifting between the sculptures, music by the French-Senegalese singer Anaiis fills the gallery with an ethereal energy. A new film by Creuzet shows a digital figure dancing in the traditional bèlè style that evolved on Martinique after colonial rule. Something about these sculptures also conjures up images of wreckage washed ashore. The found plastic speaks to the climate emergency and capitalism; the Caribbean countries are the biggest plastic polluters per capita in the world, and much of that waste is deposited into the sea. Detritus aside, Creuzet’s sculptures feel secretly alive – as though, if you close your eyes and open them, they might have crawled across the room, morphed into a new shape, or developed a new leg. In that way, these speculative works aren’t just about colonial history but also evolution, construction and creolisation. Here are sculptures about the formation and survival of diasporas amid globalisation.

1/23/2022,"When Amanda Anisimova was 16 she was touted as the next Maria Sharapova, partly for her marketability but also for her pacy groundstrokes. More recently, Serena Williams’ coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, likened her to Lindsay Davenport for her impeccable timing. Sunday night was in some ways an exhibition of both, and against other opponents that might have been enough. Two days ago, against Naomi Osaka, it was. This time, though, while Anisimova became the first player at this year’s Australian Open to break Ash Barty’s serve, she merely won the battle and not the war.  The scorecard read 6-4, 6-3 to Barty, an apt summation of a match in which the unseeded American demonstrated her increasing grand-slam clout but was well beaten by a world No 1 who, based on her form across the opening four rounds, appears on the right path to claiming her country’s first home major title in 44 years. Last week Rod Laver called Barty “unbeatable” at her best. Anisimova did her utmost to prove him wrong. Until now no one had pushed her past the one-hour mark in a match; the 20-year-old lasted one hour and 14 minutes. She ended the Australian’s tournament serving streak of 63 straight holds to lead 2-0 in the second set, and in all provided the first real test of her first-seed credentials. But Barty broke her straight back, then set about winning five of the remaining six games to close out the match. And where Anisimova’s offensive-mindedness got her part the way there, her inability to neutralise Barty’s sheer range had her on the back foot for much of the contest. “She’s an incredible athlete, an incredible competitor,” Barty said of her beaten opponent. “One of her best attributes is she turns up point after point after point. It’s just nice to see her back playing her best tennis. She’s a champion. She’s going to be in a lot of deep stages of a lot of majors in her future, that’s for sure. “I enjoy sharing the court, testing my game against her – she has an incredible game. It was nice to be able to hold firm and bring the points back into my patterns more regularly, and the big ones when it mattered most.” They were sincere words from a player at the top of the sport about one who is fast heading back in that direction following a heavily disrupted two years. Anisimova was 17 and already a junior US Open champion when she rattled Barty in the 2019 Roland Garros semi-final, leading by a set and three games before the Australian turned the tables en route to the title. The abrupt death of her father and coach, Konstantin, shortly thereafter put her tennis on pause, and her career-high ranking of 21 has since slipped to 60. The recent revival has coincided with coaching from Darren Cahill on a trial basis, which bore fruit this year when Anisimova won her second WTA title at the Melbourne Summer Set warm-up event. Even so, Barty is the more vastly improved since that French Open final. She changed up her shots at will and yielded an incredible return on a serve that topped out at 182km/h. At 3-3 in the first set she had Anisimova scooting between the tramlines like she was doing a beep test and earned three break points for her troubles. The 25-year-old will play her fourth consecutive Australian Open quarter-final on Tuesday against another American – 21st seed Jessica Pegula, who beat Greek fifth seed Maria Sakkari in straight sets on Sunday – with a view to becoming the first local to win the tournament since Chris O’Neil in 1978. “She’s able to hold baseline really well,” Barty said of Pegula. “Her swings are quite linear and she gets a racket behind the ball and swings through the path. The ball comes at you at a different trajectory, and her ability to absorb pace and then add to it when she wants to is exceptional. “It’s going to be a challenge for me to try and push her off that baseline and make her uncomfortable and feel like she has to create. But I know that she’s also going to be doing the exact same thing to me and trying to make me uncomfortable. That’s the chess game that we play. You go out there and have fun with it, see who can execute better on the day, and that’s about all there is to it.”",Sport/Sport,Ash Barty turns on style to end Amanda Anisimova’s Australian Open revival,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/23/ash-barty-amanda-anisimova-australian-open-match-report
1/23/2022,"The European Union will be ready to launch sanctions against Russia “within days” of a military attack on Ukraine, a senior official has said, as the volatile security crisis enters a new critical phase. EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday are expected to issue a further warning to Moscow, amid simmering tensions over Russia’s buildup of 100,000 troops and heavy weapons along its border with Ukraine.  The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will brief the ministers by video link on his talks last week with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Geneva. The latest diplomatic effort failed to produce a breakthrough, but both sides agreed to keep on talking. EU sources are pessimistic about the Kremlin climbing down from maximalist demands that would effectively give Russia a sphere of influence in eastern Europe. Ministers meeting on Monday, however, will not discuss specific sanctions. Instead they are expected to echo earlier EU warnings of “massive consequences” without going into specifics. “If such a very serious development [Russian troops crossing the border] happens the reaction will be very quick, the reaction will be extremely clear. And again it will be a question of days … not a question of weeks,” a senior EU official said. The official predicted there would be an “even more remarkable” unity among the bloc’s 27 countries than in 2014 when sweeping economic sanctions against Russia were adopted. “Yes, there are different sensitivities, but all member states have an acute sense of what is the European Union interest, which is at the end of the day a version of their national interest,” the official said. Behind the repeated assertions of unity, it’s no secret that western allies are divided on how to respond to further Russian military aggression. The US president, Joe Biden’s comments that Nato allies would be “having to fight about what to do and not do” in the event of a “minor incursion” of Ukraine – comments the White House subsequently rowed back on – were seen as undiplomatic, rather than untrue, in Brussels. In the EU, where sanctions have to be agreed by unanimity, differences are emerging. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has expressed doubts about cutting off Russian banks from the Swift global payments system, one option under discussion. Poland and the Baltic states, however, think it is a mistake to take anything off the table. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, accused Germany over the weekend of not showing enough support for his country. Writing on Twitter, he expressed disappointment about Germany’s apparent hesitations on Swift, refusal to supply offensive weapons, as well as recent comments from the head of the German navy, who said Ukraine would never get Crimea back. V-Adm Kay-Achim Schönbach, who also said it was “nonsense” Russia wanted to invade Ukraine, resigned on Saturday, while the German government distanced itself from his views. Writing before his resignation was reported, Kuleba said: “German partners must stop such words and actions to undermine unity and encourage Vladimir Putin to a new attack on Ukraine.” Kuleba’s criticism of Germany’s coalition government is shared by many in the European parliament, where a large majority last month called for sanctions against Russia to encompass exclusion from Swift, which is used in more than 200 countries and territories. “We should not be limiting the scope of various actions and thereby making it easier for Putin to have options for the violent alternative,” Michael Gahler, a German MEP from the centre-right Christian Democratic Union party, which is not in power, said. Gahler, the parliament’s standing rapporteur on Ukraine, said it was “unfortunate” that Germany was not delivering offensive weapons to Ukraine. Germany’s coalition government refuses to export weapons to conflict zones, in line with longstanding policy, rooted in the country’s history. In the event of war, Gahler also said the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Russia to Germany should not come into operation. The MEP is urging EU officials to look into boosting gas supplies from southern pipelines and liquefied natural gas from the US. But it is not just Germany that has raised questions about EU unity. Alarm bells were set off when it was announced last week that Hungary’s autocratic prime minister, Viktor Orbán, would meet Putin on 1 February to discuss a planned Russian-built nuclear power station in Hungary, the Sputnik vaccine and Hungary’s gas supply contracts. While potential sanctions against Russia are a closely guarded secret, it is clear there is a sliding scale of options, with the harshest measures being considered for a full-scale attack. As well as Swift, EU officials are looking at banning the export of key technology to Russia, visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials and oligarchs close to the Kremlin.

Diplomats say the EU will face a more complex choice if Russian pursues other forms of aggression, such as cyberwarfare and disinformation, but decides against a military attack. EU officials believe Russia was responsible for the recent cyber-attack on Ukrainian government websites. Last month EU leaders warned Russia there would be “massive consequences and severe cost” in response to “any further military aggression”. Central and eastern European countries argue that does not means sanctions should only happen if there is a military attack. Countries will also weigh how sanctions affect their economic interests. “With sanctions, especially economic sanctions, there is a debate on how harsh they can be because they always come back to you in the EU,” a senior diplomat said. “Individual member states are more generous with the sanctions that hurt them less than others. That is the name of the game a little bit.”",News/World news,EU official vows rapid sanctions if Russia launches Ukraine military attack,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/eu-official-vows-rapid-sanctions-if-russia-launches-ukraine-military-attack
1/23/2022,"“Pastor, do you think we could hold a service at my house next Thursday?” the peroxide-haired gangster wondered, cradling an AK-47 in his lap as he took a seat beside the man of God. A few months earlier, the 23-year-old had bought his first home with the fruits of his illegal work as a footsoldier for one of Rio de Janeiro’s drug factions. Now, he wanted to give thanks for the blessings he believed he had received from above.  “I’ve dodged death so many times. It was He who delivered me from evil,” the drug trafficker reflected as he began another 12-hour night shift on the frontline of the Brazilian city’s drug conflict. That Christian conviction was echoed all around the young outlaw, on walls adorned with frescoes of the Old City of Jerusalem and an extract from the Epistle to the Galatians: “Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.” The gangster’s body celebrated his religion, too. One wrist carried a tattoo of a cross and the words “Jesus lives”. The other featured the motto: “May my courage be greater than my fear and my strength as great as my faith”. “They know theirs is a cut-throat world so they seek something to believe in,” said Elias Santana, a favela-based preacher who has made it his mission to save the souls of Rio’s ever more evangelical gangsters. When Rio’s drug conflict exploded in the 1980s, Brazil’s evangelical revolution was still gathering pace and many gangsters looked to Afro-Brazilian deities such as Ogum, the God of war, for protection. Drug bosses frequented Afro-Brazilian temples, built shrines to Orixás and wore necklaces to show their devotion to the Umbanda and Candomblé faiths. Four decades later, many of those sanctuaries have been replaced with sculptures of Bibles and murals of the Last Supper, as a new generation of born-again criminals takes power, influenced by a brotherhood of pentecostal preachers. The sway those pastors hold over Rio’s so-called “narco-pentecostals” is unmissable in the hundreds of favelas controlled by gunmen from its three main gangs: the Red Command (CV), the Friends of the Friends (ADA) and, perhaps the most evangelical of all, the Pure Third Command (TCP). Drug lords, some regular churchgoers, have incorporated Christian symbols into their ultra-violent trade. Packets of cocaine, handguns and uniforms are emblazoned with the Star of David – a reference to the Pentecostal belief that the return of Jews to Israel represents progress towards the second coming. Gang-commissioned graffiti offers spiritual guidance and heavenly praise. On one recent evening, a senior trafficker wandered into a service in suburban Rio, unarmed and unannounced, as a preacher read from the Book of John. “I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.” Surrounded by local children and their smartly-dressed parents, the gangster took a white plastic chair in the corner, bowed his head and began to pray. Nowhere is the evangelisation of Rio’s underworld more visible than the Complexo de Israel, a cluster of five favelas near the international airport governed by Peixão (“Big Fish”), a preacher turned drug peddler who takes his nickname from the ichthys “Jesus” fish. (The drug lord’s second-in-command is named after the Judaean prophet Jeremiah, while their troops are known as the Army of the Living God). In tribute to the area’s boss, a mural of the cartoon character Fishtronaut has been painted at one entrance, framed by a line from Psalm 33: “Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord”. A neon Star of David, at night visible for miles around, sits on a water tower at one of the complex’s highest points. Nearby, on an outcrop looking south towards Rio’s Christ the Redeemer statue, a Bible sits in a display case. “Rescue me, O Lord, from evil men,” reads its inscription, from Psalm 140. “Protect me from men of violence who devise evil plans in their hearts and stir up war every day.” Police call Peixão, who is wanted for dozens of crimes including torture, murder and concealment of death, one of Rio’s most ambitious and iron-handed villains, whose fast-growing criminal empire makes a mockery of his purported Christian faith. In 2019 he was accused of leading the Bonde de Jesus (Jesus Crew), a gang of rifle-toting extremists who allegedly ransacked a succession of Afro-Brazilian temples. Afro-Brazilian celebrations have reportedly been outlawed in the Complex of Israel. But some residents say the bling-averse gangster’s Bible-infused “doctrine” – which includes keeping the community’s streets tidy and well-lit, acts of charity to impoverished locals, discouraging swearing and drug use among gang members and a military-style focus on discipline – has improved life in a ghetto long neglected by the state. “There’s order in the favela,” said Juju Rude, a local rapper whose songs describe life in a community ruled by God-fearing gangsters. The Afro-Brazilian musician, who identifies as an evangelical Christian and has an Uzi tattoed on her belly, said she was troubled by Rio’s surge in faith-related bigotry and violence. “It’s not cool to see people prevented from practising their faith in the place where they live.” Overall, however, she thought life had improved under the favela’s current churchgoing administrator: “It’s new for everyone, an environment like this.” Rio’s narco-pentecostals admit their often brutal line of work clashes with the scripture they profess to follow. As one top trafficker in another gang-run part of town lounged on top of a Honda motorbike surrounded by bodyguards with automatic rifles, he acknowledged the drug trade was an “evil” business that sometimes entailed horrific violence. But the gangster claimed his faith inspired him to minimise the barbarity, by trying to persuade fellow criminals to spare those who crossed them. “Those I can save, I save,” he said, remembering how he once persuaded a colleague not to murder a trafficker who stole a weapon and defected to a rival group. Instead, the traitor was forced to clasp his hands together, as if in prayer, and shot at close range, shattering his metacarpal bones but preserving his life. In another favela, a footsoldier with a Bible tattooed on to his chest spoke of how he enjoyed attending services at the God is Love pentecostal church, a fundamentalist congregation with temples across the US and Europe. “It makes me feel lighter,” he said, before racing away on his motorbike with an AR-15 slung over his shoulder. Christina Vital, an academic who has spent nearly 30 years studying evangelism’s advance into gangland Rio, said it was inevitable traffickers had embraced Christianity, given the breathtaking evangelical tsunami that has swept over Brazilian society during that time. Evangelicals now occupied key positions in the world of crime, just as they did in the media, politics, judiciary and culture, she said. Nor was it surprising that vulnerable, marginalised young men sought guidance and compassion from the preachers searching Rio’s favelas for souls: “It’s such an awful, fragile life. They live in fear.” Vital said the consequences of the improbable fusion between crime and Christianity were unclear. There was evidence of “a certain containment” of bloodshed, she said, but the blending of religious intolerance with “staggering” gang violence was disturbing. Pastor Elias said he respected all faiths and believed his Godly crusade was helping pacify a city where hundreds of mostly young, black lives are lost each year. “This is Christianity’s duty: to save.” A week after being invited to bless the footsoldier’s first home, the preacher donned a garish magenta shirt and set off down winding, muddy passageways to the modest first-floor abode for which the criminal had paid 8,000 reais (£1,000). He squeezed inside, accompanied by half a dozen Bible-carrying helpers, and the group began to sing an anthem called “Oh! Jesus Loves me”. “Far from the Lord, I walked, on the path of horror. Never did I ask about Jesus. Nor did I seek His love,” they sung as the gangster bowed his head. When the singing stopped, a female church member stepped forward and clutched the host’s arm as his girlfriend and mother – a cleaner just home from work – looked on. “God has chosen you. God is here right now!” the woman told him. “Just look at my goosebumps! God is here!” she proclaimed, her voice trembling as she summoned an angel to watch over the trafficker’s life. After 20 minutes of prayer and a reading from Psalm 23, the trafficker thanked his visitors over hotdogs and led them outside, visibly moved by their words. “It’s a life of loneliness,” said the pastor, “and Christ has come to free them from this servitude.” A warm breeze coursed through the favela’s narrow back alleys and for a moment the world seemed at peace – but the calm lasted only two hours. Shortly after midnight the crackle of gunfire woke residents, as traffickers stormed a nearby neighbourhood in the hope of expanding their domain.

1/23/2022,"Sonita Gale’s impassioned documentary draws necessary attention to the “hostile environment” the UK government has created for migrants. She draws a through line from the British empire to today’s refugee crisis, connecting it to the Windrush scandal and Brexit. Case studies filmed during the early days of the pandemic highlight the impossibility of the situation: a Pakistani family of four have British-born children who are ineligible for citizenship; the parents have been granted leave to remain but with “no recourse to public funds”. Elsewhere, an immigrant-led charity that provides hot meals for the NHS receive a commendation from Boris Johnson but no support from the council. An overpowering score is sadly distracting and labours the point; the subject alone is grave enough.
