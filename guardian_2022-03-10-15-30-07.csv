3/10/2022,"Airbnb has announced plans to provide free short-term accommodation for flood-affected residents in the Northern Rivers, as pressure mounts on the company to switch its model and offer long-term rentals at market prices for homeless people. Before the floods, the area was already suffering a housing crisis, with 2,300 homes needed to take the heat out of the market and create what would be considered a healthy vacancy rate. Now it will be felt acutely, with early calculations showing more than 2,195 houses have been rendered uninhabitable because of the floods. More than 6,260 Airbnbs are operating in the area, according to the open source data tool Inside Airbnb. Of those, 4,006 (64%) had a high availability rate, meaning they were available to tourists most of the year and unlikely to be an owner-occupier renting out their home occasionally. It is not clear how many of the listed properties were damaged by the floods and neither Airbnb or its competitor, Stayz, has provided those statistics. The housing situation in the area is dire. The two evacuation centres are full and with nowhere else to go, houses are cramped, with up to three families living in the same property. There has been pressure from local residents, advocates and some politicians for companies like Airbnb and Stayz to open their doors and offer families long term rentals. Airbnb said it was working to provide free accommodation on a temporary basis, but was yet to release the details. “Our hearts go out to all those impacted by the floods and the local authorities working hard to keep our communities safe,” a spokesperson said when approached for comment. “We are currently working with a partner on an initiative to offer up free, temporary housing via our Host network and hope to have more to share shortly. “In the meantime, Airbnb is encouraging its community to donate to the Australian Red Cross Floods Appeal.” Jenny Leong MP, the NSW Greens housing spokesperson, said the “offer” to help was not enough when people urgently needed places to stay. “It’s unclear what is being offered free, for who, and for how long – people need certainty and security,’ Leong said. In November, the New South Wales government changed the short-term holiday policy and now several of LGAs in the northern rivers are subject to a restricted 180-day rental period. Leong said the state government needed to step in to either suspend short-term rental accommodation, unless in exceptional circumstances, or provide incentives for owners to offer long-term leases. “(This would) ensure that people who have nowhere to live have access to every available rental property at reasonable market rates for the next 6-12 months.” Kate Stroud, a Lismore resident, said with no assistance from the government or accommodation providers they have been left to fend for themselves. Stroud and her partner lost everything in the floods and have been staying with friends in Lismore. “Basically everyone is staying with friends, you have multiple people, families, all staying in one house,” she said. “There was already a housing crisis here due to the increase of people coming during Covid and investors from bigger cities buying property here and converting them to Airbnb[s].” The flood water level in her house went up to her neck, and they had to be rescued by a neighbour with a jetski. They have been told it will take three months just to get the power back on, and are worried building supplies, which were already struggling with supply chain issues, will be hard to come by. “Our friend has said we can stay, but that’s not realistic if it’s months and months,” she said. The chief executive of Northern Rivers Community Gateway, Jenni Beetson-Mortimer, said the community urgently needs temporary to long-term housing. “There’s no transitional accommodation at all,” she said. “It’s dire here for the community at the moment.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She called on the government to help provide emergency housing for people, so they weren’t overcrowded in the homes that survived. “We need the government to do something in that space.” Sandra Johnston lives on the Gold Coast, but she is stepping in to help. Two days ago, she reactivated the Caravans for Flood Victims (Give, Loan or Rent) Facebook group – which she started with a friend after the bushfires. The group helps people with caravans get in contact with people who have lost their homes. “Now they’re drying out down there I thought this would be perfect,” Johnston said. “If everyone who had a caravan or motorhome lent one, it would mean those people trying to clean their houses would have a shower and toilets. They’re self-sufficient.” The group has only been up three days but she has already had interest and hopes word will spread. “We want a flood of caravans now,” she said.",News/Australia news,Pressure grows on Airbnb to permit long-term rentals as NSW floods worsen housing crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/10/pressure-grows-on-airbnb-to-permit-long-term-rentals-as-nsw-floods-worsen-housing-crisis
3/10/2022,"An artist is dead in his Chelsea studio, stabbed in the throat, blood everywhere. But this stage is no crime scene: the only red stuff is the strawberry jam that policeman Harold Webber spreads on his bread. That’s because Mark Ravenhill has sliced off the first act from Charles Bennett’s thriller, best known for becoming Alfred Hitchcock’s first talkie in 1929. We don’t see the artist’s attack on a young woman, Alice, who kills him in self-defence. In Ravenhill’s version – half his dialogue, half Bennett’s – we instead hear about it in grim detail. Alice (Jessie Hills) tells first Harold (Gabriel Akuwudike), to whom she is engaged, and later her mum, Ada (Lucy Speed). Harold has been assigned the murder case, which could bring about promotion, and the conflict between public duty and personal loyalty to his fiancee gives Bennett’s play the suspenseful momentum of a potboiler (further boosted by the arrival of a blackmailer). Ravenhill’s version includes a wealth of social context. It’s the summer of 1928: a kitchen radio tells of Emmeline Pankhurst’s funeral and the Equal Franchise Act giving women over 21 the right to vote, but in the backroom of their cornershop, Ada tuts about Alice’s flapper style and narrows her daughter’s horizons. Awe of a higher social class is shown as one reason why Alice accompanied the artist back to his home, while Ravenhill’s extra emphasis on the abuse of power, and its attendant complicity, resonate in the age of #MeToo. There are other headline 2022 issues, too, such as cronyism and wavering trust in the police to protect women. The challenge, mostly but not always achieved, is to treat these seriously while also oiling the wheels of an edge-of-your-seat thriller. “Everyone loves a murder,” says Ada, anticipating extra newspaper sales in the shop. That applies to theatregoers who might expect a certain sort of old-fashioned mystery but get some extra queasy realism too, which can sometimes prove a jarring combination. Like Hitchcock’s Stage Fright, there’s an acute awareness of the inherent theatricality of the justice process, and like I Confess there are compelling moral quandaries. Some of the characterisations need further complexity, however, and Anthony Banks’s stylish production could do with ratcheting up the tension and pace. Patrick Walshe McBride, as the blackmailer, excels when reflecting on the hidden lives of gay men in the 20s. Though languidly sly, like Donald Calthrop in the film, he seems more irritant than menace to the couple and there is a little too much humour in the mix – especially in the scene where the word “knife” is repeated, to comic rather than chilling effect. Arielle Smith’s choreography turns a rumba between Alice and Harold into an aftershock of trauma but that sequence doesn’t yet startle as it might. David Woodhead’s handsome, jutting design gives a striking cutaway of the corner building, with lamp-lighters, stray dogs and cyclists bustling around the edges. There’s a pulsing, spectral sound design from Ben and Max Ringham while Howard Hudson’s lighting of the shop’s latticed glass creates a palpable sense of confinement. One smart design touch among many is the silhouette of a ghostly nightdress hanging in a window, evoking the image of Anny Ondra in the film. Hitchcock casts quite the shadow but by the end Ravenhill emerges as a master of moral suspense.

3/10/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting economic sanctions have exacerbated a cost of living crisis that was already well under way, and the chancellor is under pressure to do more to help at his spring statement on 23 March. Last month, before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with energy prices already surging, the chancellor announced a package of measures to help to cushion the blow to households of rising domestic fuel bills. They included a £200 discount on consumers’ bills in October, which will have to be repaid through their bills over the following five years; and a £150 council tax rebate for homes in bands A to D. The bill payback scheme has been controversial, with financial expert Martin Lewis calling it a “worrying gamble” which risked unravelling if gas prices did not fall back as expected. Economy-wide inflation was already running at 5.5%, the highest rate in almost 30 years, and is expected to surge higher in the coming months. With state benefits due to be uprated in April by a much more modest 3.1%, many lower-income households were already likely to see their living standards fall. At the same time, the 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions earmarked for health and social care comes into effect in April. Homeowners on floating-rate mortgages will also have been affected by the Bank of England’s decision to increase interest rates in February, with further rises expected in the coming months. Thinktank the Resolution Foundation has called it the biggest hit to living standards since the 1970s. Swingeing sanctions on the Russian economy, including a ban on oil imports from next year, have sent oil and gas prices through the roof. Gas has traded above £5 per therm, compared with less than £2 a month ago, before partly falling back. It is unclear how much of that increase will persist, and the price cap on domestic energy bills has already been set for the next six months – but at best it suggests prices may remain high for longer than the Treasury feared. Cutting Russia out of the global economy is likely to push up the prices of other commodities, too. Anti-poverty campaigners and thinktanks such as the Resolution Foundation are calling on the chancellor to uprate benefits by more than the planned 3.1%, which given the rate of inflation will mean a substantial decline in living standards for many low-income households. Sunak cut the taper rate for universal credit in his autumn budget, allowing claimants to keep more of their benefits as their pay increases – he could reduce it further. Many backbench Tories would love him to ditch the increase in national insurance contributions. That appears unlikely – Sunak and Johnson penned a joint op-ed committing themselves to it at the end of January. One radical option could be to cut the basic rate of income tax – or to promise to do so in future, something the chancellor is already believed to favour in the run-up to the next general election.",Lifestyle/Money,What can Rishi Sunak do to relieve the cost of living crisis?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/10/what-can-rishi-sunak-do-to-relieve-the-cost-of-living-crisis
3/10/2022,"Rishi Sunak is facing intense pressure from Conservative colleagues to take action in this month’s spring statement to alleviate the cost of living crisis, which has been dramatically exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Asked about the impact of sanctions on Russia for consumers at home, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, told MPs on Wednesday he believed the public was “willing to endure hardships” in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. But many Conservative MPs are privately and publicly urging the chancellor to do more to soften the blow, and one source suggested Treasury officials were already drawing up possible policy options. Sunak’s February package of a £200 energy bill cut, to be paid back over five years, and a £150 council tax rebate had been criticised already as too meagre to cushion the blow significantly for many households. New analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests the impact of the war on energy prices means those measures may now protect consumers from just a fifth of the coming increase. “Living standards will suffer across the board,” they warn. The IFS calculates that providing the same level of protection as Sunak had planned would now cost an additional £12bn. Its director, Paul Johnson, said the chancellor must make a “huge judgment call”. “Will he do more to protect households from the effects of energy prices which have risen even further in the last two weeks? If he doesn’t then many on moderate incomes will face the biggest hit to their living standards since at least the financial crisis. If he does, then there will be another big hit to the public finances,” he said. Treasury sources rejected the idea of ditching the national insurance increase due to come into force in April and said the spring statement would be “policy-light”, but did not rule out Sunak taking further action on living standards. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, used prime minister’s questions to repeatedly link the cost of living crisis to the impact of the invasion of Ukraine. He called for more direct help to cut energy bills, including a windfall tax on oil companies, but also demanded urgent action to reduce reliance on hydrocarbons, including an end to a de facto ban on new onshore wind projects. Johnson dismissed the idea of a windfall tax, saying: “The net result of that would be to see the oil companies put their prices up yet higher, and make it more difficult for them to do what we need them to do … and that is divesting from dependence on Russian oil and gas. That is the way forward for this country – it is to take a sober, responsible approach.” Starmer responded with derision, saying: “I don’t think the prime minister understands the mess he’s in.” During a later statement by Kwarteng about phasing out Russian oil, Conservative MPs underlined the scale of the challenge, with the former housing secretary Robert Jenrick warning: “I think we have to brace ourselves for the greatest impact on living standards that any of us have known in our lifetimes.” Robert Halfon, the chair of the education select committee, pressed ministers to echo Ireland’s approach of cutting fuel duty. “We must, must do the same,” he said. “Prices at the pumps are reaching £1.60 per litre for hard-pressed motorists. They’re paying around £16 more than a year ago. Hauliers are paying more than £120 every time they fill up at the pumps, and this is literally unaffordable for many people.” The North East Bedfordshire MP, Richard Fuller, called on the government to do more to insulate homes in an effort to reduce energy demand. The former business secretary Andrea Leadsom told the Guardian no option should be ruled out – including a tax on the energy companies, which have been making record profits. “The chancellor will no doubt be looking carefully at further steps in addition to the energy support he has already put in place,” she said. “In such unprecedented times, every solution should be on the table – from an urgent focus on home insulation to rapid deployment of batteries to store wind and solar power and even to short-term ramping up of production in the North Sea basin and further taxes on big oil companies.” Sunak has been holding roundtables with backbench Conservative MPs to discuss ways to alleviate the impact of rising energy bills, though one attender said the chancellor had stressed the parlous state of the public finances. Speaking this month after giving a lecture at the London School of Economics, Sunak appeared to acknowledge that more might need to be done. He pointed out that part of the cost of living support package will continue to help consumers into the autumn, but added: “As ever part of my job is always to be listening to people and making sure the policies that we’ve got in place are the right ones to help the economy, to help families and people can judge me on my track record about how we do that.”",News/Business,Sunak under growing pressure to react to Ukraine crisis in spring statement,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/10/rishi-sunak-under-growing-pressure-react-ukraine-crisis-spring-statement
3/10/2022,"Loretta Breuning grew up around a lot of unhappiness, but couldn’t figure out why. To try to find out, she avidly read up on psychology, alongside raising two children and working as a professor in management at California State University. “I thought that, if I followed the research, it would make everybody happy all the time,” she says. “And then I saw that my students were not that motivated, my kids were not that motivated, and the kids of social science professors were not that motivated. So I started looking for the deeper roots of our motivation and our emotions.” She went on to write a book, Habits of a Happy Brain: Retrain Your Brain to Boost Your Serotonin, Dopamine, Oxytocin and Endorphin Levels. Today, when the news seems endlessly bleak, we all need an extra blast of positivity. Can harnessing our understanding of brain chemicals – from dopamine and endorphin to oxytocin and serotonin – help? Breuning, along with a number of scientists working in the field, believe so. Most of what we know about the biological basis of our emotions comes from research on animals. Think of the lab rats who learned to press certain levers to get more sugar or cocaine and who demonstrated the two-pronged pleasure circuit of wanting and liking. Wanting is associated with the neurotransmitter dopamine, and liking with the heavenly feelings of cannabinoids and opiates that our bodies produce when we get our desires. Oxytocin’s reputation as the love hormone stems largely from experiments with prairie voles nurturing their young, which showed oxytocin is what makes social bonding so delightful. In other words, these types of studies may not qualify us to make detailed pronouncements on the cause and effect of any activity on any individual human’s brain chemicals, but they do offer useful dots we can join. We often refer to pleasures as rewards, because they evolved to encourage behaviours that promote survival. But they definitely are not, says Breuning, “just to make you happy about sitting around contemplating the universe”. Dopamine is often mentioned in terms of addictions, consumerism and social media, but it is there to alert us to seek basic necessities such as food and a mate. “Think about a monkey looking for food,” says Breuning. “When they see food in the distance, dopamine is released, and that gets their attention, releases their reserve tank of energy, and motivates them to step forward. Each step toward the reward triggers more dopamine.” Dopamine is part of pleasure, but it’s the anticipatory, excited, searching aspect. So apart from staring at junk food ads, what are the healthy ways to get the buzz? “Have a long-term goal, a short-term goal, and a middle-term goal,” Breuning says. “So that you’re always stepping toward a reward, and you’re always stimulating it a little bit.” This will help, because “dopamine doesn’t last, it’s not designed to last. If you’re dying of thirst, as soon as you get water, then water doesn’t make you happy any more.” She suggests building a skill “that helps you reach a distant dream. Maybe you only spend 10 minutes a day on that skill, but it continually sparks that feeling that you’re getting closer to the reward. Another one would be planning an event like a party, anything that gives you something to look forward to, that you have control over, that you can regularly invest effort in.” There are zillions of unhealthy options for short-term goals, of course – sweets, mindless internet shopping, drugs and booze – but Breuning advises just taking time to plan your entertainment. “You can enjoy yourself by researching a list of things that you actually like, to be ready when you have a tired moment.” It was the professor Kent Berridge who first identified the pleasure system of wanting and liking. The bliss of the liking part of pleasure has, he says, “a much smaller and more fragile brain basis” than wanting – the dopamine bit. “That’s part of why the intense pleasures in life are less frequent and less sustained than intense desires.” But even short-lived pleasure can put us on a more positive footing, so thank goodness there are many sources: seeing a cute baby laughing, eating tasty food, and sex are all excellent ways to light up the pleasure centres. Sadly, most of these come with built-in satiety – once we’ve eaten a certain amount of cheese, it becomes less and less pleasing and we become “full”, at least until we see the dessert menu and a new wave of dopamine is triggered. But there is an easy way to sustain the thrilling push-pull cycle of pleasure: “Music, and also dance,” says Olivia Foster Vander Elst, a musician turned neuroscientist, who is doing a PhD in salsa dancing at Aarhus University in Denmark. “With both, you get this constant renewal of the liking phase. So you get these really long pleasure cycles. And the satiation phase is also quite weak.” It doesn’t matter if you listen to Let It Go repeatedly, or a playlist of your favourite arias – the pleasure keeps coming. A recent paper Foster Vander Elst co-authored states that the positive effect of music is partly down to a constant anticipation of what’s coming next: “The ‘sweet anticipation’ stage of this pleasure cycle is both highly motivating and pleasurable.” Foster Vander Elst is devising ways to measure brain activity during dancing. How is it, she asks, that even when we’re exhausted, we can dance for hours? “It’s an amazing thing that the exhaustion drops away as a result of moving to the music.” Salsa has the added advantage of being a partner dance. “That links in with some very cool research that’s been done on dance and synchrony generally, that it fosters feelings of empathy and closeness to other people,” she says. You can get the same emotions from merely watching aesthetically pleasing movements (hello, Strictly). We may not yet know precisely what’s going on in the brain in dance, but, says Foster Vander Elst, “we know that moving in synchrony raises pain thresholds”. This bring us back to the so-called love hormone, oxytocin. Breuning is worried we have unhelpful idealised expectations of it. “Animals seek a group when they feel threatened. So you can let down your guard because you’re protected by others – an inherently selfish feeling. A zebra can’t eat if it’s constantly looking for a lion. When it’s surrounded by others then it can relax and eat.” While bonding makes you feel safe, Breuning says, “when you have idealised notions about social groups, then frankly your social relations can end up disappointing”. Instead she advises us to think about trust rather than social lives. “That trust is reciprocal, so you have to offer support in order to get support.” If you’re feeling oxytocin-starved, Breuning’s solution “is to build your side of a bridge with a lot of people. You can’t control when they cross it, but you’ll be nicely surprised.” Getting oxytocin this way, she says, “is much better than feeling like you have to follow the herd every minute, which is what your inner mammal thinks – it feels threatened when you’re isolated.” This is the neurotransmitter that we often hear about in relation to antidepressant drugs and the high of MDMA. But its role in mood is not well understood. We make it from a substance called tryptophan, which is found in plenty of healthy foods, but there’s no evidence that eating them will boost serotonin levels or happiness. We do know that the mysterious universe of microbes that live in our guts has been positively linked to serotonin production (90% of our serotonin is made in the gut), so eating a microbiome-supportive diet can help. Avoid high-sugar and processed foods, and go for a diverse, high-fibre, mostly plant-based diet incorporating fermented products such as tofu and sauerkraut. There is plenty of evidence that eating like this results in less depression and anxiety. Breuning links serotonin’s glow to feeling like a winner. “Mammals are very competitive and hierarchical,” she says. “They’re always looking for the one-up position, because that helps them spread their genes. Everyone has this impulse, and your mammal brain rewards you with serotonin when you gain the one-up position.” But it doesn’t last, she says, so you can end up in a never-ending needy cycle. Her advice is to find ways to put yourself up, without putting others down, by focusing on your strengths. “But also,” she says, “be philosophical and know that we’re not designed to have serotonin every minute.” Ciara McCabe, professor of neuroscience, psychopharmacology and mental health at the University of Reading, says it’s likely that serotonin levels are relatively fixed. “What we do know is that if you engage in what you consider subjectively rewarding, pleasurable experiences, you will probably release some of those chemicals involved in enjoyment, calmness or contentment.” And if you make a habit of doing those things – whether it’s playing with your cat, winning at Monopoly or canoeing – even the anticipation and cues associated with them will become pleasurable. These are endogenous (meaning we make them in our bodies) opioids that flutter through us in fleeting moments of intense pleasure, but can also dull the pain of injury. They are always trotted out as the reason exercise makes us feel good, but in fact exercise produces a veritable cocktail of drugs along with other physical and psychological benefits – from a sense of achievement to better cardiovascular health. David Raichlen is an evolutionary biologist at University of Southern California whose current goal is to discover why exercise is rewarding to humans when most animals evolved to preserve physical exertion for when necessary (running from a lion, say). His hypothesis is that it evolved 2m years ago, when we swapped a life of foraging for higher-octane hunter-gathering. His research has shown that when we exercise moderately – perhaps a brisk walk in which we get out of breath – we make endocannabinoids. These are, says Raichlen, “the body’s form of the active ingredient in marijuana. The main endocannabinoid that seems to be associated with exercise is called anandamide, which is named after the Sanskrit word ananda, meaning bliss.” When you get this kind of endocannabinoid activation, he says, a couple of things can happen. “One, you get that analgesic effect, a kind of pain-relief effect. And there’s also a mild, rewarding sensation – not like the high that you would get from smoking marijuana, because you’re not bathing your brain in this chemical – being produced on demand, likely in areas associated with reward.” Rather than euphoria, the result is a gentler glow of wellbeing. These chemicals are broken down fairly quickly, but not before they cheer us up. “We’re such a weird species, because we have this ability to think about how we’re feeling,” says Raichlan. “You get this shift in your mood from physical activity, and then that alters your mindset for the rest of the day, even when that chemical is gone.” If an injury or health condition means you can’t exercise as much as you would like, PET scanning has recently revealed another route to endorphin heaven: social laughter. So maybe it is the time to get to a comedy club or ring your funny friend. A 2017 study by Finnish and British researchers found that social laughter “significantly increased” endorphins. Raichlen thinks we can all benefit from understanding these lifestyle connections to mood, “because it means that we’re not totally helpless. If there are actions that people can take that are tried and true and scientifically tested, they can improve the way you feel. I think it’s really important for people to know that.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Watch Strictly, eat sauerkraut, win at Monopoly: expert tips for hacking your happy hormones",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/10/watch-strictly-eat-sauerkraut-win-at-monopoly-expert-tips-for-hacking-your-happy-hormones

3/10/2022,"Support for students with disabilities should be improved, the government has been urged, after analysis showed that fewer than a third receive the disabled students’ allowance (DSA) meant to help them access and thrive in higher education. According to a report, just 29% of students in England and Wales with a known disability received the allowance in 2019/20 while those who have been through the application process complained of bureaucracy, long delays, inconsistent quality of support and a lack of communication. “A nightmare,” said one student, “a full-time job” said another describing the challenge of coordinating support which is rarely in place at the start of a course and can take months to secure, delaying students’ progress and putting them at an unfair disadvantage. The report by ex-paralympic swimmer Lord Chris Holmes described the DSA as “a gem of a policy”, but too many potential recipients are unaware of its existence. He also saidthe 30-page application and lengthy assessment process are daunting and the “administrative burden can act as a barrier to study rather than the support intended by the scheme”. The DSA is intended to cover study-related costs a student may incur because of a mental health problem, long-term illness or any other disability. It is dependent on individual need rather than household income and does not have to be repaid. As of the next academic year, undergraduate and postgraduate students can receive up to £25,575 a year to pay for specialist equipment or non-medical helpers, for example a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter, a note taker or additional travel costs incurred as a result of a disability. Based on data from the Student Loans Company, the report found that 75,900 students from England and Wales received DSA in 2019/20. Yet, figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency show the total number of students with a known disability – who were domiciled in England and Wales and studying in a university in any one of the four home nations – was 261,620. The SLC said there were a number of reasons why students may not apply for or be eligible for DSA. Students need to be eligible for student finance and they need to have a disability defined under the Equality Act. It also pointed out they may not require DSA support as their university may already have provision in place. An SLC spokesperson said reforms were already under way to improve and speed up the DSA application process. “It will remove key pain points in the customer journey, provide the student with a single point of contact and support throughout the process, and contractual control to ensure consistent quality of service.” The Holmes report makes 20 recommendations including an awareness campaign for schools, a digital “passport” to be carried through from school to higher education and beyond to work, greater flexibility in provision and improved communication and quality assurance processes. Lord Holmes, who won nine golds, five silvers and one bronze medal across four paralympic games, said: “DSA has such inherent possibilities, to enable, to empower all our disabled young people. When it works well, it really works. “As this report illustrates, with a series of carefully considered changes, DSA could go even further, enabling hundreds of thousands of disabled students to fulfil their potential.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “There are valid reasons why some students with a disability would not need to apply for DSA, for example because their needs have already been fully met by their university. Work is under way with the Student Loans Company to improve students’ experience, by making the application process easier, and working to shorten the journey between applications and support being received.”",News/Society,Just 29% of students in England with disabilities receiving DSA allowance – analysis,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/10/just-29-of-students-in-england-with-disabilities-receiving-dsa-allowance-analysis
3/10/2022,"Covid cases appear to be rising in older people as increased socialising, waning immunity and a more transmissible version of the Omicron variant threaten to fuel a resurgence of the virus. Tests on nearly 100,000 swabs from homes across England reveal that, while infections have fallen overall since the January peak, one in 35 people tested positive between 8 February and 1 March, with cases either level or rising in those aged 55 and over. Scientists on Imperial College’s React-1 study said the R value – the average number of people an infected person passes the virus to – remained below 1 for those aged 54 and under, meaning cases were in decline. But for those aged 55 and over, R stood at 1.04. The suspected uptick has raised concerns as older people are more prone to severe Covid and have had more time for their immunity to wane, as many had their booster vaccines several months ago. The findings come as the latest government figures showed a sharp 46% rise in new recorded UK cases week on week – to 346,059 over the past week – and a 12% rise in hospitalisations to 8,950. Prof Paul Elliott, director of the React study, said the rise was probably driven by factors including the lifting of all Covid legal restrictions in England on 24 February, more mixing between age groups and waning protection from booster shots. One idea experts are investigating is whether hospitalisation rates are being driven by “unshielding”, where people who have been extremely careful for two years have emerged into a world where infections are still rife. Another driver is thought to be the BA.2 form of Omicron, a relative of the original BA.1. While BA.2 does not seem to evade immunity any more than BA.1 or cause more severe disease, it spreads faster and increases R by 0.4 compared with BA.1, the Imperial researchers found. “From what we see, BA.2 is more transmissible and may prolong the Omicron wave of the pandemic,” Elliott said. “It’s taking over, so that could explain higher infection rates.” Since the first BA.2 cases were discovered in December, it has steadily gained ground and now accounts for about half of all Omicron cases in England, with levels currently highest in London. It is unclear how large a wave of infections and hospitalisations BA.2 could drive given widespread immunity from vaccines and past Covid infections. A further push on vaccinations is due in early April when over-75s and the clinically vulnerable will be offered a fourth shot. “Additional doses of vaccine are almost certainly going to be necessary,” said Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag). Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said it was “impossible to make a sensible prediction” about the size of any BA.2 wave but the situation needed close monitoring. “The worry is that it’s hard to see anything happening in the next few weeks that will reverse the growth of BA.2 unless, that is, people decide on their own account to step up precautions.” Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College, who is not on the React-1 study, said the recent rise was foreseeable. “We’ll see a great deal more of this, along the lines of recent resurgent spikes in Scotland and Hong Kong,” he said. “Caseloads were by no means low or under control as we came out of all mitigations and, when you add in waning immunity and the enhanced transmissibility of BA.2, it looks like we are in for a difficult period, especially for the elderly.” He said a lack of measures such as mask-wearing and testing potentially left only the option of “a wider push for fourth shots, beyond the over-75s” but cautioned that very regular boosters may not be sustainable long-term. Openshaw said the rise in cases and hospitalisations should remind people the pandemic is not over. “I think it’s a shame that the message that seems to have got out to the population is that it’s all over and we don’t need to be cautious any more,” he said.",News/World news,UK Covid cases rising among those aged 55 and over,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/uk-covid-cases-rising-among-those-aged-55-and-over
3/10/2022,"The prime minister’s pledge to join the US in phasing out Russian oil – and exploring ways to do the same with gas – is aimed at hitting the Kremlin’s coffers but it also presents a problem for the UK. In Britain, about 4% of gas and 8% of oil comes from Russia, far lower than its European neighbours. But turmoil in the energy markets has sent gas and petrol prices soaring, exacerbating the cost of living crisis. Weaning ourselves off Russian resources – by sourcing supplies elsewhere or pursuing the increased use of renewables and nuclear – will cost money and take time. One obvious solution is to use less gas and oil in the meantime via a nationwide effort that, while redolent of the sacrifices made in previous global conflicts, need not be nearly as painful and could have long-term benefits. Ways to do it range from turning down the thermostat and driving slower on the motorway to accelerating the shift towards technology such as heat pumps. Here are some options. Government policy could reduce Britain’s gas usage by the equivalent of current Russian imports by 2027, according to the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), solving the problem more quickly than increasing gas output from the North Sea. A good starting point, the ECIU said, is to upgrade 1m homes a year from Band D of the energy efficiency scale to Band C, reducing their gas usage by 20%. That isn’t unprecedented. The UK installed energy efficiency measures in 2.3m homes in 2012, mostly loft and wall insulation, before policy changes slashed the rate to about a 10th of that. UK gas demand was 810 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2019, the last year before the pandemic, while Russian imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are about 33.7TWh, 4%. The ECIU says its insulation proposal would save 3.6TWh a year at first and 18TWh annually by 2027, shaving £170 off an annual gas bill. The Climate Change Committee estimates that two-thirds of the UK’s 30m homes could be made more energy-efficient for less than £1,000 each. A back-of-an-envelope sum indicates a cost of less than £20bn to do that. Throw heat pumps into the mix and efforts to wean ourselves off gas speed up. They use electricity to suck in warmth from outside for home heating and hot water. Much of the UK’s electricity is still gas-generated but the switch could still reduce gas usage by 80% in better-insulated homes. As gas is phased out of the electricity mix, that percentage should grow. The government is aiming for 600,000 heat-pump installations per year by 2028, up from about 67,000 in 2021, but the Climate Change Committee says 900,000 annually is doable. A report by energy experts at the Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP) estimates the cost of publicly-funded support for hitting the CCC’s trajectory at £0.5bn a year, rising to £3bn by 2030. “[The rollout] should be upgraded so that more people make the switch,” said the RAP’s Jan Rosenow. There is a £5,000 government grant available for installation and sky-high gas prices now means that they can be competitive on price with gas boilers, he added. That’s a position backed by household supplier Octopus Energy. According to the ECIU, the gas saving via heat-pump installation could hit 17TWh by 2027 and would reach the point at which it offsets the loss of Russian LNG imports by 2031. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said last week that Europeans could help weaken the Kremlin’s power by turning down the thermostat by a degree. This, said the IEA, would save about 10bn cubic metres of gas within a year, a useful saving on total Russian gas imports of 155bn cubic metres. Taking shorter showers and running a lower-temperature cycle on washing machines could also have a small but meaningful effect if enacted on a mass scale. The IEA also has a paper, published in 2018, entitled Saving Oil in a Hurry. It outlines ways in which economies could “rapidly” cut oil consumption by as much as 10% in the event of a major disruption to global oil supplies. The IEA’s measures are intended to solve a short-term disruption and could serve as a stopgap while alternative, non-Russian, supplies are arranged. Widespread adoption of some of the measures in the long term could also help reduce carbon emissions. The report recommends conserving fuel by making changes to driving behaviour such as going below the speed limit, turning off the engine at traffic lights and not putting the pedal to the metal when they go green. It also points to ways to make personal vehicles more efficient such as ensuring tyres are properly inflated, not driving around with heavy loads and sharing rides with colleagues or friends. Other suggestions address the big picture, such as a shift towards home working, something the authors of the 2018 report could not have envisaged would already have been put on the agenda by the pandemic. The report also suggests some relatively drastic government-imposed measures that might meet with opposition from motorists. They include things like electronic road pricing (tolls) and restrictions that allow people to drive only at certain times or on alternate days. One solution that might prove more popular is making all public transport free of charge.",News/Environment,Phasing out Russian oil: how UK consumers can help the war effort,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/phasing-out-russian-oil-how-uk-consumers-can-help-the-war-effort
3/10/2022,"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned a Russian attack on a children’s hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol as evidence of “genocide” as the US moved to drastically bolster support to the war-ravaged country with a $13.6bn aid package. The Ukrainian president shared video footage showing massive destruction at the hospital – a combined 600-bed complex with children’s and maternity wards – in the southern port city that has been under relentless bombardment for nine days. “A children’s hospital, a maternity ward. How did they threaten the Russian Federation? What is this country, the Russian Federation, that is afraid of hospitals, maternity wards and is destroying them?” said Zelenskiy on Telegram. “Hospitals and schools are destroyed. Churches and ordinary buildings are destroyed. People are killed. Children are killed. The aerial bombing of a children’s hospital is the ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening.” The White House condemned the attack as “barbaric” while US House lawmakers voted to rush through a $13.6bn aid package that would increase military and humanitarian support to Ukraine and its European allies. The aid includes $6.5bn for the US costs of sending troops and weapons to eastern Europe and equipping allied forces there, and $6.8bn to care for refugees and provide economic support to allies. Senate approval is expected within days. The House also passed a bill banning Russia oil imports. US House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she talked to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for 45 minutes on Wednesday. She said they discussed the weapons and other assistance his country needs and “the crimes against humanity that Putin is committing”, including the maternity hospital air strike. “This is the beast that Putin is,” Pelosi said. Pelosi indicated the $13.6bn US aid package was likely to be just the tip of a much broader aid effort. “All of us will have to do more” to help Ukraine in coming weeks or months and over the long term to help it rebuild, Pelosi said, referring to the US and Nato allies. The US meanwhile warned Russia could be preparing to use chemical or biological weapons in the war. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that Russia had been making “false claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine”, and added that the allegations had been echoed in Beijing. “Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” she tweeted. Amid the western warnings that Moscow’s invasion was about to become even more brutal as Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, seeks to regain momentum, local authorities described the damage to the Mariupol hospital as “colossal” and said women in labour were among the wounded. A local official said the attack injured at least 17 staff, though no deaths were immediately reported. Zelenskiy said the “direct strike by Russian troops” had left children under the wreckage. The deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said Mariupol was being shelled continuously and 1,170 residents had died, 47 of whom were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday. “It’s medieval,” he said. “It’s pure genocide. The attack isn’t simply treacherous. It’s a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.” The Guardian was unable to fully verify the Ukrainian officials’ accounts, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack. The Red Cross has described conditions in the port city as “apocalyptic”, while deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the situation was “catastrophic”. Zelenskiy compared the devastation and suffering there to that caused by the Nazis. Journalists have described corpses lying unburied in the streets and hungry residents breaking into stores in search of food, and melting snow for water while thousands sheltered in basements. The Russian army had also “shot and bombed” a humanitarian corridor agreed with Moscow and intended to allow civilians a safe route out, the deputy mayor of the city said, mined the road, and installed a checkpoint. Of an estimated 200,000 people desperate to leave, only 2,000 to 3,000 a day were able to. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy said at least 35,000 civilians were able to leave the cities of Sumy, Enerhodar and areas around Kyiv. He said he hoped the evacuations would continue on Thursday with three more routes set to open out of Mariupol, Volnovakha in the south-east and Izyum in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskiy said on Wednesday the threat level against the country was “at the maximum” and again called on the west to impose a no-fly zone, saying it risked a “humanitarian catastrophe” if it did not. Speaking in Washington, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, reiterated the Nato position that a no-fly zone would bring Nato into direct conflict with Russia. The conflict has also raised fears of a nuclear accident in a country with major nuclear plants and the site of the Chernobyl disaster. The UN’s atomic watchdog said Wednesday it saw “no critical impact on safety” at Chernobyl, location of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986, despite a loss of power there. But it warned it was not receiving updates from either Chernobyl or Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, which is also now under Russian control. The UK said the Russians had confirmed the use of a thermobaric rocket system. The weapons, also known as vacuum bombs, suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion. Three rounds of peace talks between the two sides have so far yielded no progress, with Moscow continuing to insist Ukraine must “demilitarise” and enshrine neutrality in its constitution before it halts what it calls a “special military operation” aimed at ensuring Russia’s security. Moscow insisted on Wednesday it would prefer to reach its goals through negotiation. In other developments: Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has landed in Turkey for the face-to-face talks on Thursday with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, the highest-level meeting between the two countries since Russia invaded. Kuleba warned in a Facebook video his expectations were “limited”. So far, the parties have been engaged in lower-level talks in Belarus, largely over humanitarian issues and involving only Ukrainian officials. Leaders of the 27-nation EU are to meet in Versailles on Thursday and Friday. A draft declaration prepared for the summit said: “Russia’s war of aggression constitutes a tectonic shift in European history.” The leaders are expected to discuss reducing the bloc’s energy dependency on Russia, and Ukraine’s request to join the EU The US is weighing sanctions on nuclear power supplier Rosatom, a senior Biden administration official said on Wednesday. Nestle, cigarette maker Philip Morris and Sony on Wednesday joined the list of multinationals stepping back from the country.
