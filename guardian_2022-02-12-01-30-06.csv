2/12/2022,"What has happened to Keir Starmer, the seasoned anti-war protester? The Labour leader and I both marched on the Stop the War demonstration against the Iraq war in 2003. I remember reading with interest his Guardian article “Sorry, Mr Blair, but [UN resolution] 1441 does not authorise force”, questioning the legality of that war. Only two years ago, when he wanted to appear to be on the left of Labour as he sought election, I was happy to see him promise to bring forward a Prevention of Military Intervention Act.  Starmer’s recent outburst about the Stop the War coalition – he claimed that we were effectively on the side of Vladimir Putin for opposing the march towards war over Ukraine – seems to be a critique of his former self. Does he now think he was not a “benign voice for peace” but “at best naive; at worst actively giving succour to authoritarian leaders”? Partly it is sad because he in all likelihood believed what he said then but has now joined the ranks of those politicians who will say anything, no matter how flatly it contradicts their previous statements, if it serves their current ambitions. However, everything we and Starmer thought at the time has been proved correct by events, and every criticism he makes of the anti-war movement now has been made before – and revealed as false. We were told more than 20 years ago that opposition to war in Afghanistan was the same as supporting the Taliban; then that we were aiding Saddam Hussein when we demonstrated against war with Iraq in 2003. When we opposed the Nato bombing of Libya in 2011, we were accused of backing Muammar Gaddafi. It was a lie then, and it is now. We opposed those wars because we believed they would worsen the situation – increase not decrease terrorism, cause greater instability, and leave millions suffering from the consequences. On all those questions we have been proved decisively correct. Our opposition to war in Ukraine is not based on any support for Putin – he has his own record of militarism and war – but because we recognise that such a war would be devastating and that a peaceful resolution can be found. The argument that we oppose war because we support the governments of those countries suggests that there can be no good reason for people to oppose war other than being beholden to another power. This is an insult to all those campaigning for peace, including in Russia, where no doubt pro-war elements claim their opponents are supporting Nato or the US. In order to justify his argument, Starmer has to argue that Nato is purely defensive. “There is no equivalence between a defensive alliance that has never provoked conflict and those who would inflict the appalling cost of war on to others,” he writes. Tell that to the people of Afghanistan and Libya, who have suffered so much as a result of the Nato wars. Stating that the organisation is a defensive alliance does not make it true. It has moved a very long way geographically from the North Atlantic, which was its original remit. Its origins were in the cold war; its role since the end of that war, in 1989, has been expansionist and interventionist, and it is now playing an active role in manoeuvres and arms provision in eastern Europe. It is increasingly looking towards the Indo-Pacific as another theatre of conflict. This military organisation is also putting huge pressure on member states to increase their spending on “defence”. Nato demands at least 2% of GDP from each country, which encourages further militarism and conflict. Meanwhile, in Britain millions of people are facing a serious cost of living crisis, an NHS in permanent emergency mode and record levels of inequality. The Boris Johnson government – whose foreign minister does not appear to know which provinces are in Russia and which in Ukraine – has been the most belligerent in its talk about war with Russia. No doubt this is a tactic to deflect from the prime minister’s own domestic crisis, but it could also lead to an extremely dangerous situation for people in Britain, as well as in Ukraine and Russia. Starmer should be opposing this government, not trying to bang the drum for war even harder. His invocation of the Attlee government in his defence ignores the foreign policy record of that government, which supported wars in Korea and Malaya and introduced the nuclear bomb with “a bloody Union Jack on top of it”, in the words of Starmer’s hero, Ernest Bevin. Starmer sees Nato and the NHS as twinned achievements of Attlee’s government, but a much closer and more meaningful comparison with the creation of the health service is the founding of the United Nations in 1945, rather than the cold war military creation he celebrates. Stop the War has been proved right over the previous wars, while those who mistakenly supported them seem to have learned no lessons from the terrible consequences of their errors. War over Ukraine, involving nuclear powers, could have much more damaging consequences. Diplomacy could lead to a way out, we believe, as even the French and German governments are trying to establish, in contrast to Starmer. We have become all too familiar with Labour politicians promoting wars. Stop the War will continue its campaigning against this threat and the British government’s connivance in it – with Labour acquiescence. Our message is simple: don’t get fooled again.

2/12/2022,"A patient has died in Bedfordshire after being found to have Lassa fever, the UK Health Security Agency has said, as the confirmed case brought the total number of people diagnosed with the disease in England to three. The death comes less than 48 hours after it emerged that two people had been diagnosed with the potentially deadly infectious disease, and a third “probable” case was under investigation. In an update on Friday, the UKHSA said the “probable” case had now been confirmed and had died.  It is the first time cases of the potentially deadly infectious disease, caused by the Lassa virus, have been identified in the UK for more than a decade. In a statement, the UKHSA said: “The UK Health Security Agency can confirm that the probable case of Lassa fever under investigation is now confirmed, bringing the total number of cases to three. Sadly, this individual has died. “We are contacting the individuals who have had close contact with the cases prior to confirmation of their infection, to provide appropriate assessment, support and advice. The risk to the general public remains very low.” A Bedfordshire hospitals NHS foundation trust spokesperson said: “We confirm the sad death of a patient at our trust, who had confirmed Lassa fever. We send our deepest condolences to their family at this difficult time. “We will continue to support the patient’s family and our staff and are working closely with colleagues from the UK Health Security Agency to undertake a robust contact-tracing exercise.” One of the two previously confirmed cases has recovered, while UKHSA said on Wednesday that the second patient was receiving specialist care at the Royal Free London NHS foundation trust. The three cases were within the same family in the east of England and were linked to recent travel to west Africa. Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness. People usually become infected with Lassa virus through exposure to food or household items contaminated with urine or faeces of infected rats. The virus can also be spread through bodily fluids. People living in areas of west Africa with high populations of rodents where the disease is endemic are most at risk of Lassa fever. Imported cases rarely occur elsewhere in the world. Such cases are almost exclusively in people who work in endemic areas in high-risk occupations such as medicine, or other aid workers. Most people with Lassa fever will make a full recovery. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals. Symptoms are usually gradual, starting with fever, general weakness and malaise. After a few days there may be headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, and abdominal pain , according to the World Health Organization. In severe cases there may be facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract and low blood pressure. Deafness occurs in 25% of recovered patients. In half of these cases, hearing returns partially after one to three months. Before these cases, there had been just eight cases of Lassa fever imported to the UK since 1980. The last two cases occurred in 2009. There was no evidence of onward transmission from any of these cases.",News/Society,Person diagnosed with Lassa fever dies in Bedfordshire,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/11/person-diagnosed-with-lassa-fever-dies-in-bedfordshire
2/12/2022,"Let’s face it, the Fifa Club World Cup has never quite caught the public’s imagination here in Blighty. Not like the old Intercontinental Cup, which saw Celtic and Racing Club throw hands, and Manchester United exchange pleasantries with Estudiantes. Two thoroughly entertaining late-sixties donnybrooks that have gone down in sporting folklore, with the caveat that obviously nobody wants to see that sort of thing, won’t somebody think of the kids, etc. Still, come on. Bertie Auld refusing to leave after being one of six men to be sent off, instead playing the rest of the match? George Best bobbing and weaving in the middle of a comic-book cloud of fists and boots? You’d pay plenty of folding money for that sort of nonsense today, and throw in some coins too.  But the Club World Cup? The Fiver for one remembers very little about it. It’s not exactly thrown up too many tales for the ages since its inception in 2000. Erm. There was that time Manchester United’s participation caused them to break the FA Cup, wasn’t there? Or how about that day Liverpool were forced to play Monterrey while also facing Aston Villa in a parallel dimension in order to maintain the integrity of a trophy with three handles? And, er, Chelsea have had a go as well, haven’t they. Did any of them ever win it? Probably. Or maybe not. Can’t remember. Chelsea are having another crack at pretending to care this year. They’ll face Palmeiras in tomorrow night’s Abu Dhabi final, a couple of days after seeing off Al Hilal in the semi thanks to Romelu Lukaku’s possibly-confidence-restoring-though-let’s-see-how-it-pans-out close-range poke. Thomas Tuchel missed that four-yard screamer, on account of being stranded at home with the Covid. The club hope he can post a negative test today, then win a 30-hour race to the UAE for the big one. While we’re almost certainly not going to remember the result of the game this time next week, never mind next year, here’s to Tuchel making it in time, thus creating another of those ripping yarns to file alongside United copping the flak for New Labour’s hubris and Villa thrashing Liverpool’s kids in the Rumbelows Cup.

Kurt Zouma will be available for West Ham’s trip to Leicester on Sunday despite calls to drop the defender over a video of him kicking and slapping his cat. “We as a club took that decision and I stand by that,” said David Moyes. Derby have reached a settlement with Middlesbrough​ to end their ongoing legal dispute. Boro missed out on the 2018-19 Championship play-offs behind Derby, who were later found to have breached financial rules. Ralf Rangnick has called on Manchester United’s forwards to score more, and defended Harry Maguire. “I think he had an outstanding game against West Ham,” Rangnick mused as the centre-back stepped on several rakes behind him. Jürgen Klopp liked what he saw from new signing Luis Díaz on his first Liverpool start. “It was probably one of the best [first games] I ever saw from a new player, because he looked completely natural,” big Jürg trilled. Eric Dier will miss Sunday’s game with Wolves as he continues to recover from thigh-ouch. “Unfortunately he’s not fit,” sobbed the Spurs manager, Antonio Conte. “For sure, he’s a big loss for us. He needs a bit more time to recover.” Frank Lampard’s Everton will be without Yerry Mina for up to 10 weeks. “It’s a strong injury around his quad and disappointing for us all,” sighed Lamps. Wilfried Zaha will stay on penalty duties for Crystal Palace despite his woeful scuffer against Norwich. “People always remember the last penalty but when you look at his record on penalties it has been really good,” Vieira cheered.

2/12/2022,"The newly opened Broadway revival of The Music Man is the first time Hugh Jackman has played brazen swindler Harold Hill (though, per the Playbill credits, he apparently played Salesman #2 as a teenager). But the role is such a natural fit for Jackman’s interests as an actor that the performance itself feels like a revival, too – a triumphant return, rather than a long-awaited teaming of superstar and role. Thanks to Covid, it can be both: this Music Man planned to begin its run in 2020, only to be pushed back repeatedly, finally beginning previews in December 2021, then shutting down for a week after Jackman himself caught Covid. It officially opens many months and two calendar years after its initial target.  Throughout the swiftly paced production, Jackman looks like he’s been raring to go. As Hill, a con artist disguised as a traveling salesman who moves in on a small Iowa town, selling the promise of civic improvement through musical instruments, uniforms, and band instruction, Jackman is appropriately snaky and cynical – when he’s not pretending to be an upstanding musical impresario, of course. But when he brings a signature number like 76 Trombones or a smaller one like Gary, Indiana to a close, there is unmistakable joy in his eyes; at times, facing the rapturous crowd reactions, he looked as if he might burst out laughing with glee. Though Jackman is best known for his nearly two decades playing the grim Marvel Comics superhero Wolverine, Harold Hill is of a piece so much of his other film work: the smooth-talking embezzler of Bad Education, the carny-barker stylings of Real Steel, and his singing and dancing PT Barnum in The Greatest Showman. He’s obviously fascinated by the ways that flash and charm can give way to a different, more nefarious form of confidence, and whether or not that can circle back to a kind of honorable flim-flam for the greater good. That’s The Music Man all over; Jackman slips into its rhythms effortlessly. It’s tempting to say that the rest of this production director Jerry Zaks can’t match the star power at its center, but that’s not quite it – not exactly. Sutton Foster plays the buttoned-up librarian Marion, who is immediately suspicious of Hill but starts to see the good in him even before he does, and she emerges as a formidable match for her co-star. This is particularly noticeable in the second act, which she periodically rescues the killer song score from its first-act front-loading. Jefferson Mays and Jayne Houdyshell provide ample support as the sputtering Mayor Shinn and his wife, respectively; beyond the marquee names and Broadway mainstays, the whole stage is packed with terrific young performers. They’re the real spectacle, moreso than the sometimes overly fussy sets and costumes; even those with their own lines aren’t really playing fully realized characters here, but their big-group production numbers provide the passionate rush that Broadway audiences pay exorbitant prices to experience firsthand. That razzle-dazzle could explain the decision to invite critics to the glamorous opening-night performance, rather than having a press night during previews. With an appreciative star-packed crowd applauding not just every introduction and musical number, but the appearance of a pool table – warming up for the inevitable (Ya Got) Trouble – and the occasional semi-clever flourish of stagecraft, it’s easy to feel either like a fan giving in to the will of the crowd, or a grump who’s pointedly refusing to. In other words, it’s a high-energy con worthy of Harold Hill. If only this production acknowledged that shamelessness a little more directly, a little more cleverly. Much of the time, it attempts a mega-yet-modest balance of big-budget splashiness with a beating human heart underneath, and comes across like a high-energy cover rather than any kind of reimagining. Is there something, anything, The Music Man might say about how we think about attractive scams and manipulations now, over a century past its 1912 setting? Maybe the answers to that question could turn facile or labored; this version doesn’t show any interest in finding out. The original Broadway run of The Music Man opened in the same season as the original West Side Story, and though the recent Steven Spielberg remake of West Side Story is a film and not a stage production, it can’t help but make its fellow revival from the class of ‘57 look a little staid and traditionalist by comparison – even allowing for the fact that it’s a less revolutionary text to begin with. That best Ppcture nominee pays tribute to the show’s strengths while making tweaks, updates, and recontextualizations that sometimes place classic songs in a new light. This Music Man is mostly playing Meredith Wilson’s hits. There are a ton of them – Trombones, Trouble, Marian the Librarian, Till There Was You, and so on, plus worthy deeper cuts like The Sadder But Wiser Girl – and Jackman, Sutton, and company nail them all in the moment. As Broadway slowly regains its footing during a drawn-out pandemic, that might be more than enough. A few months down the line, though, and this might look more like an enthusiastic mascot for live theater than a great show. To his credit, Jackman probably wouldn’t mind.",Arts/Stage,The Music Man review: Hugh Jackman dazzles in uneven Broadway show,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/11/the-music-man-review-hugh-jackman-dazzles-uneven-broadway-show
2/12/2022,"A Republican Senate primary candidate in Arizona has been condemned for a “disgusting” campaign ad in which he shoots at lookalike actors portraying Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and incumbent Arizona senator Mark Kelly.  Jim Lamon, an energy executive, shared the ad on Twitter, saying it would be aired at this year’s Super Bowl. Lamon would face Kelly in a general election in the autumn should he secure the Republican nomination. Kelly is the husband of former Democratic congressman Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who was shot in the head in 2011 while greeting constituents outside of a local grocery store. In Lamon’s ad, styled as a western, figures identified as the “DC gang” enter a town wearing cowboy boots and carrying firearms, their faces half-covered by bandanas. Onlookers are upset by their presence, with one declaring: “We’re tired of being pushed around!” Lamon enters, along with Mark Lamb, a real-life local sheriff, and Brandon Judd, the current president of the National Border Patrol Council. Lamon addresses the three actors playing Biden, Kelly and Pelosi, saying: “The good people of Arizona have had enough of you.” “It’s time for a showdown,” Lamon adds. When the Democrats draw their firearms, Lamon fires his own gun, shooting the weapons out of their hands as the rest of the town cheers. The three Democrats run away. Criticism towards the ad has been swift, with many people pointing out other recent instances of violent imagery used by members of the Republican Party. Last November, Paul Gosar, Republican representative for Arizona, was officially censured by the House after sharing an animated video depicting him killing the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking Biden. Shannon Watts, founder of the group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, called Lamon’s ad “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the Lamon campaign refused to respond to the Washington Post about criticism of the ad, but said it “shows the DC gang drawing on Lamon and he merely shoots the weapons out of their hands”. “Unlike Kelly, Jim Lamon will shoot straight with Arizonans and take the fight to Biden – and he damn sure won’t let the left bully him into backing down,” the spokesperson said.",News/US news,‘Disgusting’: Republican Senate hopeful condemned over ‘showdown’ TV ad,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/11/republican-senate-candidate-jim-lamon-arizona
2/12/2022,"Some teams carry the added pressure that comes with expectation like a tailored jacket slung over a relaxed shoulder. For others, anticipation of glories to come chafe like a pair of skinny jeans in early January. Wales and Scotland both fall into the former category. These two rugby sides, these nations even, prefer to face up to challenges as underdogs. From Owain Glyndŵr to William Wallace, the heroes of England’s smaller neighbours are heralded for their willingness to charge into the maw of certain doom in honour of the cause.  Come Saturday, only one group of players will enter the Principality Stadium with the familiar feeling of their backs against the wall. Their opponents have no such luxury. There’s no need to look at what the bookies are saying. Stuart Hogg’s team are unquestionably favourites. “If you look at last week’s performances why wouldn’t they be?” was Wales’ coach Wayne Pivac’s reply when asked about the disparity in expectations between the two teams. Indeed. Scotland’s win over England, although scrappy and perhaps lucky, was another major victory in a 12-month period that has also seen them win in London and Paris, as well as beat Australia and Japan at home. Such is the depth of Scottish rugby right now that Gregor Townsend could make five changes to the 15 that secured a second successive Calcutta Cup – including his entire front row – without setting off alarm bells. Wales are traversing a different path. An injury to Josh Adams has further tested the squad’s resources and means Pivac is now without 659 Tests’ worth of experience from eight absentees alone. Their most experienced starting flank is 22-year-old Taine Basham playing his ninth Test while his partner is the uncapped Jac Morgan, also 22. Pivac conceded that his loose trio, which includes Ross Moriarty, lacks height. All are shorter to a man than their Scottish counterparts. Pivac is working with the tools he has but he’s also offering an insight into the way he believes he might pull off a chaotic upset. Scotland’s lineout was imperious last week, procuring clean ball from all 16 of their throw-ins. Pivac will therefore look to turn possession at the breakdown by unleashing two natural open siders and a No8. that likes it loose. Townsend all but relinquished the battle on the ground. “We don’t look at jackaling as something that is always required,” the Scottish coach said. If Wales are to disrupt Scotland’s rumbling pack and win the odd penalty then their captain Dan Biggar will need to be at his best, particularly with that metronomic right boot. Described as the team’s “general” and “one of the best goal kickers in the world” by his coach, Biggar will make his 100th Test appearance in front of a packed crowd. “We’re looking for a reaction,” Biggar said, eager to move the conversation away from the 29-7 loss to Ireland. “We’re looking to stifle the momentum they’ve built up. “But there’s a bit of pressure on them. They’ve been talked up and they have to go and try win a championship from what I’m hearing. So let’s see how they go and we’ll judge them at the end of it.” Biggar praised his opposite number Finn Russell, emphasising his ability to methodically control a game as well as produce magical moments with deft cross-field kicks and covert passes. But both Pivac and his captain spoke of the psychological boost a partisan home crowd gives them. Even Hogg was gushing in his praise of Cardiff’s mighty arena in the centre of the city. The Scots won in Llanelli in 2020 but they’re winless in the capital since 2002. And though he finds himself in a difficult situation now, Biggar knows that a single game can shift the discourse. “History tells us when we have a poor performance we tend to respond quite well,” he said, referencing a rousing 30-10 win over France at home in 2014 immediately after a 26-3 loss away to Ireland. “We’re under no illusions and not papering over any cracks. It’s nothing new, responding to a tough performance. This time of the year all the experts come out and have all the answers. We’re keeping everything in-house and making sure we respond in the best way possible and that’s by fronting up against a team that is full of confidence.” Given the nature of the two nations represented, that may hand the advantage back to Wales.",Sport/Sport,Wales look to bounce back against under-pressure Scotland,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/11/wales-look-to-bounce-back-against-under-pressure-scotland
2/12/2022,"The journalists who broke the story of Russian skater Kamila Valieva’s positive drugs test on Wednesday say they have faced death threats, abuse, and warnings they should check their tea. A separate British newspaper journalist who asked Valieva whether she was a doper on Friday has also faced intense criticism from Russian members of parliament and online.  Such was the anger in Russia when Duncan Mackay and Michael Pavitt of the Inside the Games website initially broke the story that Valieva had failed a test that both men were deluged with messages dismissing their reporting as lies – until the Independent Testing Agency confirmed it was true on Friday. Pavitt confirmed to the Guardian that Mackay had faced death threats while he had also been subjected to “significant” abuse. Other members of the team said they were also confronted by Russian journalists in the main media centre in Beijing. Meanwhile Mackay was also told by one respondent on Twitter: “You will be positive when you discover some new substances in your tea”, an apparent reference to the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006. When he replied that he didn’t drink tea, and tended to avoid the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair, he was told: “Fortunately, you know what bankruptcy is. Prepare yourself to ride this road again, bruh.” The anger among the Russian public and media also flared up again on Friday when a British journalist asked Valieva, who was found to have the angina drug trimetazidine in her body on a test taken on Christmas Day, whether she had doped and was a cheat. The skater refused to answer and the journalist was then surrounded by Russian journalists and told his questions were inappropriate to a 15-year-old child. When the story then emerged in the Russian media, the reporter faced a wave of abuse, with one respondent telling him: “Our Russian journalists can tear you to pieces!” Svetlana Zhurova, an Olympic speed skating champion and now a deputy of the State Duma in Russia, also criticised the questioner and the western media in general. “We cannot expect anything else from them,” she told Championat.com. “It makes no sense to scold and accuse them of something, they will still behave this way. Even if the Russian athlete has any therapeutic permission, they will still blame us. “At the same time, they will be completely calm about the fact that their athletes have therapeutic permission in the same way. For them, this is normal, but for our athletes it immediately becomes doping.” A similar message was conveyed by Dimitry Svishchev, another deputy of the Russian State Duma. “Unfortunately, some journalists can find the strength to talk to a child as if they were their comrades somewhere in a pub,” he told the Russian website. “Let them sit in London and ask such boorish and provocative questions to each other. Let our athletes not be touched. And even more so young athletes like Kamila. We won’t let her hurt! Children should not be asked such questions, she is still too young. We believe Valieva, we believe in her – she did not use anything forbidden.”",Sport/Sport,British journalists receive death threats from Russia over Valieva controversy,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/11/kamila-valieva-british-journalists-receive-death-threats-from-russia
2/12/2022,"When The Power of the Dog took 12 Oscar nominations on Tuesday, the key question for this year’s awards became not what will win – a clean sweep for Jane Campion’s western is now looking inevitable – but whether anyone will watch it happen. Last year’s ceremony was a muted, socially-distanced affair held at Los Angeles’s Union Station, which saw ratings for US TV network ABC fall by more than half from the previous year (which was itself a record-breaking low).  A new producer, Will Packer, has been drafted in to return the ceremony to the Dolby Theatre with enhanced pomp and pageantry on 27 March. A “super-event” loophole is being used to mean that even the unvaccinated can attend, with guests only requiring proof of a negative test within 24 hours to attend. It appears unlikely organisers will want A-listers to cover their faces. A no-Zoom mandate is also on the cards, although exceptions may be made in extreme circumstances to avoid a repeat of last year’s most memorable moment, when Joaquin Phoenix abruptly accepted the best actor award on behalf of Anthony Hopkins, then 83, and not permitted to video-call in from Wales. This year, 87-year-old Judi Dench is a contender in the supporting actress category for her role in Belfast and, should she win, would become the oldest-ever Oscar acting winner. Representatives for Dench did not comment on whether she would attend. The host for the awards will be announced in the next few days and current frontrunner is 25-year-old British actor Tom Holland, reckoned to be a powerful draw for younger audiences. Spider-Man: No Way Home may have landed only two nominations (costume design and visual effects), but producers are eager to harness the interest of cinema-goers, who last month made it the sixth-highest grossing film in history. Yet some suspect such measures are merely a case of deckchair rearrangement. “I don’t believe the host ever has an impact on ratings,” says Anne Thomson, editor-at-large at IndieWire. Indeed previous efforts to woo the under 30s with hosts such as Seth Macfarlane, James Franco and Anne Hathaway have been spectacular flops. “Ratings are going to rise from last year,” says Thompson, “there’s nowhere to go but back up.” Yet the economic model which relied on advertising spend for the awards telecast is almost certainly under urgent review by the Academy. “If you’re standing in the middle of a rainstorm,” says Steven Gaydos, executive VP of content at Variety, “nobody has to tell you you need an umbrella.” Gaydos believes that the Academy, caught unawares by the rapidity of change, will be scrambling to replicate the kinds of strategies now adopted by movie studios. Rather than concentrating on the box office performance of one headline movie, the focus is on the impact of a year’s worth of content. Cash-generation measures under consideration by the Academy are likely to include sponsorship deals, year-long awards clubs, social-media monetisation – and belt-tightening. And while the Oscars – and many in the industry – were previously sniffy about ceremonies such as the Golden Globes, this year’s cancellation of that, after celebrities boycotted the event and NBC refused to screen it, may have been an unexpected blow. “The Globes was a drumbeat of awareness,” says Thompson. “They were a good thing, because they were promoting the movies, and the race.” Yet the Oscars’ difficulty in attracting TV audiences predates Covid. The advent of streaming had already caused a schism in the relationship between the awards and actual cinema-going, before the pandemic accelerated the trend. “There’s some very imprecise magic that happens when you go see a movie in a theatre,” says Gaydos, “It demands some part of you.” Even if the film disappoints, “you say: ‘Well, we got out of the house!’ It was part of the human social experience.” Those films which did lure people from their sofas were conspicuously absent on the award lists with the exception of Dune, Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi epic, but its 10 nominations were primarily technical. It did make the 10-strong shortlist for best picture but ABC’s hopes for the likes of No Time to Die, House of Gucci or even Spider-Man were crushed after space was instead made for Drive My Car (a Japanese meditation on grief), Flee (an animated documentary about a gay Afghan refugee) and Coda (indie tearjerker with a predominantly deaf cast). The days of the Academy being criticised for being too mainstream are long past, thanks to the recent drive to increase inclusivity in the wake of #OscarsSoWhite and #MeToo. This largely involved increasing voter numbers from 6,000 to 9,500 with judiciously picked new recruits who have, accordingly, awarded best picture to Chloe Zhao’s Nomadland in 2021 and Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite in 2020. “There is now a built-in disconnect between the Academy’s choices and the demands of a ratings-driven show,” says Thompson. “They thought this was what they wanted! But now they’re pulling back on it.” The Baftas, which take place a fortnight before the Oscars, have also seen the fruits of backstage labours reflected in their shortlists. A review of practice in 2020 led to hundreds of rule changes to further diversity. That ceremony is also now back in person, at a full capacity Royal Albert Hall with the “largest red carpet in Europe”. Hopes have been placed on new host Rebel Wilson - a regular show-stealer – to engage audiences in the stalls and at home. “Things were tricky with distributors last year,” says Emma Baehr, Executive Director of Awards & Content, “and engagement wasn’t there.” Now that has returned, Baehr thinks, it calls for a ceremony which has “everything as it was before – but better.” Despite the negative publicity that accompanied their - now-withdrawn - special award for Noel Clarke last year, the Baftas do appear on confident ground. Their primetime BBC spot is locked in, and this is the 25th year of a headline sponsorship deal with EE. Baehr points to the number of first-time nominees on their ballots and credits interventions such as those to ensure all voters watch a minimum of 15 randomly selected films. “Bafta has culturally shifted,” she says, “and part of that means that awards shows have to move on.”",Arts/Film,The big question at this year’s Oscars – will anyone watch the ceremony?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/11/hollywood-braces-oscars-academy-awards-ceremony
2/12/2022,"Everton have suffered a significant setback in their fight to avoid relegation with Yerry Mina ruled out for up to 10 weeks with a quadriceps injury. The Colombia international sustained his third thigh problem of an injury-plagued campaign during Tuesday’s defeat at Newcastle and is not expected to return until late April. Mina’s absence leaves Frank Lampard seriously stretched in central defence, with the manager having lost Ben Godfrey for at least a month with a hamstring injury in his first game in charge.  Lampard will be without seven first-team players for Leeds’s visit on Saturday, including Demarai Gray and Vitalii Mykolenko, the club’s only recognised left-back. “Yerry Mina is an unfortunate injury which will be between eight to 10 weeks,” Lampard said. “It’s a strong injury around his quad and disappointing for us all. In the week I’ve been here I’ve realised he is a big leader in the group, a top player, and he’s a big miss. “They are two big injuries for us at centre-back. We do have players there who have to step up and have been stepping up – Michael Keane, Mason Holgate, Jarrad Branthwaite – but the options are becoming tight. They are big misses for us, I can’t deny that, but I have confidence in the squad and we just have to dig in. Sometimes digging in is the only way, particularly in our league position, so I won’t complain too much.”",Sport/Football,‘A big miss’: Everton’s Yerry Mina out for up to 10 weeks in blow to Lampard,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/11/everton-yerry-mina-out-for-up-to-10-weeks-lampard

2/12/2022,"Scotland Yard’s crisis has deepened as it emerged two officers and one former officer have been referred for potential criminal prosecution over their part in a WhatsApp group with Sarah Everard’s murderer Wayne Couzens where it is alleged misogynistic and racist messages were swapped. The Metropolitan police is reeling from its commissioner, Cressida Dick’s resignation after she failed to convince the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, she could root out wrongdoing and transform the force.  The Met has not suspended the two serving officers and they remain on restricted duties. Separately, the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), announced that its investigation into claims the Met bungled a chance to identify Couzens, then a serving Met officer, for alleged indecent exposure days before he attacked and murdered Everard in March 2021, had intensified in seriousness. A Met officer is now under investigation for gross misconduct, the most serious kind of offence under the police disciplinary system. Previously the officer was under investigation for misconduct by the IOPC. A second Met officer remains under investigation for misconduct over allegations relating to Couzens and a fast food restaurant. Messages on the WhatsApp group involving police officers included alleged offensive and abusive terms about women. Messages recovered so far by investigators began in March 2019, two years before Couzens murdered Everard. The two Met officers and one former Met officer have been referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for alleged improper use of the public electronic communications network under section 127 of the Communications Act. The two Met officers referred to the CPS are alleged to have been part of a WhatsApp group involving constables from three forces and were placed under investigation after Couzens’s phone was seized following his arrest for the murder of Everard. The Met placed its officers facing criminal investigation on restricted duties. Two other officers who were investigated for potential police discipline offences, from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and Norfolk police, were suspended by their forces. The IOPC said: “We provided a file of evidence to the CPS in December to consider potential offences against three individuals under the Communications Act 2003. We await its decision.” Extensive investigations by the IOPC continue into events surrounding the Couzens case. One investigation concerns claims to the Met of a man twice exposing himself at a south London McDonald’s days before the murder of Everard, with details of a car linked to Couzens passed to police. It is believed details included a vehicle registration plate. A simple registration plate check, available to police on systems belonging to the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency, could have linked Couzens to the alleged offending, but officers failed to identify him, the Met has already admitted. Days later Couzens kidnapped and murdered Everard as she walked home in south London. The IOPC said: “Our investigation into how the MPS handled reports of alleged indecent exposure has been completed. Our report has been shared with the force prior to our decisions on any disciplinary outcomes.” ​Furthermore the IOPC said an officer with Kent police had been placed under misconduct investigation over claims a chance to identify Couzens as indecently exposing himself in Dover in 2015 was missed. The IOPC said: “We are finalising our investigation into Kent police’s handling of an alleged indecent exposure reported in Kent in 2015, subsequently linked to Wayne Couzens. Our report is at an advanced stage.” Couzens was handed a whole-life sentence for the kidnap, rape and murder of Everard. The judge said his crimes were as serious as a terrorist atrocity because he abused his powers as a police officer to commit them. The fallout from Couzens seems highly likely to challenge whoever is chosen as the next Met commissioner.

2/12/2022,"Like it or not, Mel Gibson’s professional rehabilitation is gaining momentum. Ever since his career exploded in a mess of drunkenness, antisemitism, domestic abuse and a string of genuinely horrifying voicemails, Gib has slowly set about clawing himself out from the hole he dug for himself. It started small, with bit parts in sequels like Machete 2, The Expendables 3 and Daddy’s Home 2. It picked up speed with his Oscar-nominated film Hacksaw Ridge, and then hit a pothole with Fatman, where he played a grizzled and embittered Santa Claus. And now it seems unstoppable.  Gibson’s upcoming projects include a CIA thriller in which he stars alongside Jason Isaacs, a John Wick spin-off series and a Lethal Weapon sequel that he also plans to direct. But before all that comes Father Stu. And Father Stu will require some explaining. Based on a true story, Father Stu stars Mark Wahlberg as a cocky, womanising boxer who gets into a car accident, contracts a terminal illness and then becomes a priest. It seems like the sort of role that Wahlberg is seeking out these days to try and prove to the world that he’s a good person. He still gets to play a boxer and dress like it’s the 1970s (even though the film is set in the 1990s) but, like last year’s Joe Bell, it seems heavily weighted to counteract his negative public image. Joe Bell was about a father grieving his gay son; Wahlberg once angrily defended the homophobic remarks of Shabba Ranks and was “creeped” out by Brokeback Mountain. Meanwhile, this film is proof that people are able to change their ways for the better. And if the priest in this film can do it then maybe so can Wahlberg, a man whose history includes chasing black children while throwing stones and shouting racist epithets, and being charged with attempted murder after attacking a middle-aged Vietnamese American man. If this had been a one-man redemption bid, there’s a sliver of a chance that it might have worked. But it won’t, because it co-stars Mel Gibson. Gibson – at least judging by the trailer – plays a grizzled mechanic who hates god but, and this is only a wild stab in the dark, will probably eventually come to see the light. He too can do good things, just so long as can ignore all the unquestionable bad he’s done. Now, Gibson isn’t playing the main role here. This is a supporting character, and one that initially doesn’t seem to add much to the story. And with the Oscars still smarting from all the accusations of racism it intermittently has to fend off, the last thing it will want to do is embrace a film starring a man who once told a police officer that “the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world”. So, if the film has awards ambitions and the role could be played by anybody, why take the risk of hiring Mel Gibson at all? This one, at least, is easy to answer. It’s because the film was written and directed by Rosalind Ross. And Rosalind Ross is Mel Gibson’s girlfriend. This isn’t to do down Ross’s achievements at all. Although this the first film she has directed, she was previously a writer on Matador, a show that aired in the states on the El Rey network that was about a soccer player who was also a spy. According to her IMDb page, she also has a Boudicca film in the works. By all accounts, she is an up-and-comer. And it’s hard to see how she could be riding Mel Gibson’s coattails, since he has spent the last 15 years as a toxic pariah. True, she might not have the best handle on Gibson’s career – he was 35 when she was born, and had already made three Mad Max films, three Lethal Weapon films and a Braveheart before she had even started school – but wouldn’t you cast the man you love in your film? Perhaps I’m slightly biased towards Father Stu as a film. It has long been my belief that any character named Stu or Stuart in a movie is bound to be an irredeemable dick. Pierce Brosnan’s horrible character in Mrs Doubtfire is called Stu. The guy who runs the Overbrook hotel in The Shining is called Stuart. Matthew Lillard’s character in Scream was called Stu. There is a Minion called Stuart, for crying out loud. There is nowhere to hide. But Father Stu softens the blow a little. Its titular Stu seems like a truly inspirational figure, a man committed to helping people even in the face of an agonising death. He seems like he might be the One Good Stu. And, sure, the film he stars in looks terrible, like the sort of thing that will make the bulk of its revenue by playing in churches. And, sure, the director might be an untested 31-year-old. And, sure, it stars someone who has done so many bad things that it’s honestly hard to look at him. But, hey, Stus need to take what they can get.",Arts/Film,Father Stu: the Catholic drama aiming to redeem Mel Gibson and Mark Wahlberg,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/11/father-stu-catholic-drama-mel-gibson
2/12/2022,"Beth Kweeday really loves Greggs. The 23-year-old tattoo apprentice from Liverpool is such a fan of the high street baker that she got a tattoo of its signature sausage roll in branded packaging on her calf last November as an eternal reminder of the shop she visits more than five times per week.  But what is it about Greggs that made her want to commemorate their produce on her body? “I really like beige food, so it’s pretty much a dream for me. And I like that it’s dead cheap as well.” Kweeday starts her mornings with a Greggs vegan sausage roll, sometimes popping back in for a cheese pickle sandwich for lunch, and if she’s feeling peckish in the afternoon she might return for a chocolate muffin. Surprisingly, Kweeday’s fierce love for the high street stalwart is not unique. She is one of many Greggs superfans happy to wear their passion for the chain loudly and proudly. The retailer is now hoping that super fans and casual customers alike will snap up official branded merchandise as part of a high-profile collaboration with budget clothing shop Primark, which was announced this week. But fans have been finding their own ways to honour Greggs for some time. Independent sellers peddle pregnancy t-shirts with a Preggs logo, earrings painstakingly crafted to resemble Greggs pastries, Greggs-printed leggings, and any number of greetings cards, which typically convey how much the sender prefers Greggs to their recipient. Leah Bernard, 19, who runs Etsy shop Bernard Bits, sells earrings resembling Greggs sausage rolls in branded bags. A prototype she posted on TikTok went viral, securing 1.6 million views. They’re now one of the most popular items she sells, especially among the LGBT community. “I often get messages saying ‘this is a gift to my friend who’s obsessed with Greggs’,” she said. She thinks Greggs’ popularity is down to its heritage as a “typical British caff”. “If you spoke to someone not from the UK, that’s the first thing you’d mention. Nowhere else has it.”Pasty, a drag queen based in London, whose Greggs-inspired burlesque routine – in which she bursts out of a branded paper bag in a sausage roll costume – launched her performing career, agrees that the chain’s appeal stems from tapping into British culture. Her Greggs routine went viral on TikTok, receiving plaudits from Kylie Minogue and Years and Years, with many commenters praising it as exemplary “British drag”, a self-deprecating, comedy-driven subversion of its glamorous American counterpart. “It’s funny and absurd. Someone said, ‘try explaining this to anyone who’s not British’. I don’t think anyone outside of the UK would understand Greggs hype.”It’s perhaps this match of UK food culture with the down-to-earth, irreverent tone that is a hallmark of British humour that Greggs fans find so compelling. Tamsin McLaren, who runs Bath University’s prestigious marketing degree, said that Greggs’ “tireless pursuit of understanding their customer” has made it an iconic brand. “Greggs honest and inclusive tone of voice chimes with many who are bored by false promises and inflated prices of premium brands,” she said. The partnership with Primark is a natural continuation. The fact that they are “behaving like premium or luxury brands”, for instance by launching the clothing collection at an exclusive pop-up in Soho, “enhances Greggs’ image as a brand with humour and not afraid to be self-deprecating via irony”, she said. The brand’s success at a difficult time for the UK high street is testament to the strength of this approach. While there were several high profile high street closures during the pandemic, Greggs plans to double the size of the business and expand from 2,115 to 3,000 sites in the near future. Greggs’ chief executive, Roger Whitehouse, has said the secret lies in their savvy marketing and openness to new trends - exemplified by the brand’s carefully timed introduction of a vegan sausage roll. Greggs super fans agree.“They really go with the times. When my [show] was happening, they shared the clip on social media. I’m a drag queen and not many brands would do that,” said Pasty.Greggs’s appeal is as much rooted in familiarity as it is in novelty, she says. “For everyone in the UK, if you’re in town and you need something quick you get a sausage roll for a quid from Greggs. It’s cheap, easy food and a staple of everyone’s memory.”",News/Business, Greggs superfans bode well for Primark tie-up: ‘I really like beige food’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/11/greggs-superfans-primark-tie-up-official-merchandise

2/12/2022,"Novices have won seven of the last nine runnings of the Betfair Hurdle, the big betting contest at Newbury on Saturday, and Broomfield Burg, Jetoile and Jpr One are among the lightly-raced runners with an obvious chance to make it eight from 10 this weekend. The least exposed horse in the field over hurdles, though, is Harry Fry’s seven-year-old Boothill (3.35), with just two runs over timber to date. He was an easy winner in a strong time on his only start last season and finished a close third behind Soaring Glory – last year’s winner of this race – at Ascot in October.  He is 4lb better off with that rival and has had a two-month break since a slightly underwhelming debut over fences in early December. Back over the smaller obstacles, and with track, trip and going likely to suit, he looks over-priced in the overnight betting at around 8-1. Newbury 1.15 Refreshing though it is to see a top-notch novice like Bravesmansgame lining up for a handicap, the current form of the Paul Nicholls stable – one win from 37 before racing on Friday – is a concern as he attempts to give 16lb or more to some useful rivals. At the early odds, the progressive Pats Fancy is an obvious each-way alternative at around 5-1. Warwick 1.35 Put a line through Marie’s Rock’s run in the Lanzarote last time, when she was almost brought to a stop at the second flight, and she has an obvious chance at around 3-1 to upset Indefatigable, the likely favourite here. Newbury 1.50 Trip, going or both are among the question marks for several of these, so it may be worth chancing The Big Breakaway, placed at Grade One level over timber and fences, as he returns to hurdling after a wind op on what could be a very fair mark. Warwick 2.05 Edwardstone has made rapid progress over fences this season and should confirm his status as Britain’s best two-mile novice here. Newbury 2.25 Clan Des Obeaux is another favourite from the Nicholls stable that punters may want to handle with care.

2/12/2022,"On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the host started by mentioning the scoop from Maggie Haberman’s upcoming book that Donald Trump allegedly tried to destroy state documents by tearing them up and flushing them down the toilet.  Despite Haberman having two lengthy interviews with Trump, he claims her book is “mostly fictitious” and that the toilet story is not accurate. “This is a conversation you have with your three-year-old … not the former president,” Kimmel joked. He continued: “It’s toilet watergate is what it is.” Haberman has also revealed that Trump had maintained a friendship with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un since his presidency. “He held Kim Jong-un’s hand longer than Melania’s,” Kimmel said while showing pictures of the pair. He then joked: “Weird to think that the relationship between Kim and Trump could last longer than Kim and Kanye.” Kimmel also wondered how the right would have taken that news if it was Obama still staying friends with him. “I’m sure Fox would be super cool with that,” he said. This week it was also announced that Melania Trump would have a ‘“special arrangement” for the controversial app Parler, “social media for those who are somehow too awful for Twitter”. Kimmel joked: “The only parlour Melania cares has the word beauty in front of it.” This week reports also emerged that the Academy would not be asking for proof of vaccination for this year’s Oscars ceremony. “Maybe they have some extra spots in the in memoriam to fill,” he wondered. He joked that perhaps this year’s hosts would be “Rob [Schneider] and Nicki Minaj’s cousin’s friend”. The reports also suggested that a major reason was that some of this year’s nominees and potentially some of last year’s winners are not vaccinated. “So now it’s up to all of us to wildly speculate,” he said. “Let the witch-hunt begin.” He also wondered how Fox News would respond. “Is Hollywood a bunch of hypocrites or are the stars just like us?” he joked. It’s funny how in every scandal involving Trump and documents, none of them involve him READING them. The latest on Trump’s document flush… pic.twitter.com/uyPfVwVR2N On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also spoke about the allegations made against Trump and his destruction of documents via his toilet.
