5/20/2022,"Here is everything you need to know about the voting process in the 2022 Australia election. The 2022 Australian federal election day is Saturday, 21 May. The Australian Electoral Commission, the independent body that runs elections, says there are 17 million people enrolled to vote in the 2022 federal election – 96.3% of the eligible voting population. The deadline for enrolment was Monday 18 April. If you are not sure of the status of your enrolment, you can check here. You can also call the AEC on 13 23 26. You can find your electorate by entering your address on this page on the AEC website. The results of the 2019 election in each electorate are on the commission’s Tally Room site, but bear in mind that boundaries of some seats in Victoria and Western Australia have changed since then. You can read about what those changes mean on the election blog of the ABC’s Antony Green. If you are unable to cast a ballot in person at a polling station on election day, there are several other ways to vote. At this election extra provision has been made to ensure those affected by the recent floods in Queensland and NSW, and people affected by Covid, are not disenfranchised. If you can’t make it on the day, you can vote in advance at a pre-polling station. A list of these will be published on the AEC website. Mobile polling facilities are also set up in some hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and remote areas in advance of polling day, although at this election that service will be limited by Covid considerations (see below). You can apply via the AEC website to have your ballot papers sent to you in the mail. These must be completed by close of polling on election day and returned to the AEC, which allows 13 days after that for the ballots to arrive. In some countries you may be able to access an overseas voting centre – a list will be posted on the AEC website. Otherwise you need to apply for a postal vote, allowing enough time for the papers to be mailed to you. The AEC has expanded the provision of voting by phone (traditionally used for blind or low-vision Australians) to accommodate people who may be required to isolate because they have Covid or they are a close contact of someone who does. However, it has warned the process may not be entirely flawless. People who expect to be in isolation on polling day may apply for a postal vote. Those who test positive or who are close contacts of someone who tests positive between Wednesday and Saturday should contact the AEC to arrange a vote by phone. Close contacts who return a negative rapid test should check with their state or territory whether they are entitled to leave isolation to vote in person. If you tested positive for Covid after 6pm on Tuesday 17 May, you are eligible to vote via telephone. If you will be isolation on election day but tested positive before 6pm on Tuesday 17 May, you can vote via postal vote, however you will need to have registered for postal voting before 6pm on Wednesday 18 May. This tight eligibility for postal voting has been criticised and is set to be challenged in the federal court on Friday 20 May. At the ballot box, you will be handed two pieces of paper. The smaller is for the House of Representatives, which is elected using preferential voting. You must number every box in order of your preference for your vote to be valid. The larger is for the Senate, which consists of 76 members, 12 for each state, and two for each territory. On the Senate ballot paper, you can vote in one of two ways. First, you can number at least six boxes above the line, indicating the parties or groups you prefer in the order of your choice. Or you can vote below the line, meaning you are voting individually for the candidates nominated by each party or group. In this case you must number at least 12 boxes to cast a valid vote. There are 151 members of the House of Representatives, so one party needs to win at least 76 seats to form a majority government. Going into the election, the Liberal-National Coalition holds 76 seats, Labor holds 69 and the six others are held by minor parties and independents. To reach 76, Labor would need to retain their current number of seats and gain another seven. However, picking up an extra four seats from Liberal or Nationals would be enough for them to overtake the Coalition. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It may well be tight. According to analysis by Green: “Labor needs a uniform swing of 3.1% to gain four seats and 3.3% to gain seven. Yet Labor is defending 13 seats on a margin of up to 3%.” If the Coalition loses even one seat, but Labor fails to gain seven, Australia would have a hung parliament. In that case one or other of the major parties would have to secure the support of enough minor party or independent MPs to form government. A new wave of independents is running in Coalition-held seats at this election, which may increase the chances of a hung parliament.",News/Australia news,"Australian election 2022 voting guide: everything you need to know, including how to vote if you have Covid",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/how-to-vote-australian-election-2022-when-who-how-do-i-vote-if-i-have-covid-everything-you-need-to-know-what-time-open-saturday-voting-guide-near-me-locations-australia-federal-poll-day
5/20/2022,"The major parties are often dismissed as being too similar, but if you’re wondering how to decide who to vote for in the 2022 Australian election, here are seven key issues where there are real policy differences between the two major political parties in Australia. Labor has promised registered nurses will be on site 24/7 in every residential aged care facility in the country. It will also mandate that every resident receives an average of 215 minutes of care per day, as recommended by the damning aged care royal commission. Labor has also pledged to back aged care workers’ case for a 25% pay rise in the Fair Work Commission and has promised to fund the outcome of the case. It has promised to improve the food delivered to residents of aged care facilities by developing and implementing mandatory nutrition standards, and will push for greater transparency and accountability in the sector by making providers report publicly what they are spending government money on. Since the royal commission, the Coalition has announced a five-year $19.1bn aged care plan, which includes a major boost to home care of 40,000 new home care packages. The package also includes a boost to respite services, 7,000 new personal care workers, and 48,000 new training places. Like Labor, it has pledged to support aged care workers in their bid for higher pay, but has stopped short of committing to fund the pay rise. The Coalition is also delivering bonuses of up to $800 for aged care staff and is spending $345m to embed pharmacy services in aged care facilities. The Coalition has already broken a 2019 promise to establish a federal anti-corruption commission. The model it proposed was widely condemned as weak, toothless and an effective shield for politicians. It allows no public hearings for government corruption, cannot take public tip-offs, has a widely criticised definition of corruption, is not retrospective, and cannot make findings of corruption. It requires suspicion that a criminal offence has occurred before commencing an investigation, a threshold which critics say is hugely prohibitive. The Coalition released an exposure draft but never tabled its legislation in parliament, blaming a lack of support from Labor. Labor, meanwhile, has promised to establish an integrity commission by the end of the year. It has not released a detailed blueprint of how its model would work, but its two-page statement of principles indicates it would have the “independence, resources and powers of a standing royal commission”. Labor’s model would be able to hold public hearings, take public tip-offs, investigate MPs and ministers with broad discretion, act retrospectively, and make findings of corruption. The Coalition’s childcare policy leans primarily on past action. In the 2021 budget, the government increased the subsidy for the second and subsequent children in care, and removed the annual cap that limited the subsidy a family earning over $190,000 could receive. These restrictions had acted as a disincentive for many women to return to work. The changes took effect in March this year. Analysts say the changes reduce, but don’t remove, those workforce disincentives. Labor’s policy goes further, increasing the maximum subsidies for the first and subsequent children in care and softening the income taper so households can earn more while receiving higher subsidies. The party also pledges to get the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to work out a way to regulate childcare prices, and the Productivity Commission to review the sector “with the aim of implementing a universal 90% subsidy for all families”. According to Grattan Institute analysis, the high cost to the commonwealth for the Labor scheme would likely be more than offset by the broadly increased workforce participation. Despite significant pressure, the Coalition has not increased the 2030 emissions reduction target (26-28% compared with 2005 levels) it set in 2015. It opposes requiring anyone to cut emissions. Instead, it says it will spend $22bn on low-emissions technology by 2030, focusing on six priority areas. More than half this funding just tops up the budgets of existing clean energy agencies. Budget papers suggested the annual allocation of climate spending is expected to decrease over the next four years and the $22bn includes support for gas, a fossil fuel. The Coalition has promised to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but the plan does not explain how the goal will be reached. It assumes new technology will become commercial at some point after 2030 and be adopted. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor has a 2030 plan and a more ambitious emissions target for that date – a 43% cut. Scientists say it is significantly better than the Coalition, but less than what is needed. The ALP says it would create a $20bn “rewiring the nation corporation” to accelerate the roll out of major transmission links – poles and wires, in simple terms – to connect new solar and wind farms and batteries to the grid. Its modelling suggests 82% of grid electricity would be from renewables by 2030. It is promising to work with industry to gradually reduce its emissions using an existing Coalition policy known as the safeguard mechanism. It says it would exempt electric vehicles from some taxes, spend more on EV charging stations than the Coalition and attempt to help build global action by bidding to co-host the annual UN climate summit with Pacific countries in 2024. Both parties would allow fossil fuel exports to continue while there is a market for Australian coal and gas. The Coalition left it until late in the campaign to drop its main housing policy, which appears to offer one of the bigger differences with Labor. Buyers would be able to tap their superannuation for as much as $50,000, or 40%, to assist with the purchase of a first home, provided they later repay their retirement fund. Over-55s would also be able to access a scheme now open to 65s-plus to tip as much as $600,000 into their super to encourage downsizing and add market supply.Critics, though, note younger buyers typically have little super and extra demand would nudge prices higher. Few people had taken up the downsizing plan that’s been in place since 2018. By contrast, Labor’s schemes are means-tested and include the “help to buy” plan that would see the government chip in as much as 40% of the price for a new home (30% for existing ones) for buyers with at least a 2% deposit. To the extent it pushes up prices, the policy has a sting, but with the program capped at 10,000 a year (compared with about 100,000 first homers entering the market) the issue may be its limited scope. A separate plan to create a $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund sounds grand but the 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties over five years is also modest. Senior Coalition MPs, including the prime minister, have said they do not support the key reform proposed in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which is to enshrine a voice to parliament in the constitution. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, has been attempting to develop a consensus position that could be progressed toward referendum, but any deviation from enshrining a voice has been roundly criticised by those supportive of the Uluru statement. He’s also attempted to progress a version of the voice under ordinary legislation, which has also been criticised as not conforming to the central demands of the Uluru dialogues. There are some outliers within the party. Labor has committed to implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full, including progressing a referendum to enshrine a voice to parliament in the constitution. It has also committed to establishing a Makarrata Commission, which it says will develop a national framework for treaty-making and support and fund local truth-telling efforts, in partnership with First Nations groups and local communities. There isn’t a lot of detail around this model but it may look to Victoria’s Yoorrook Justice Commission. Few significant reforms to health have been announced by either of the major parties, despite rising out-of-pocket health costs and pressure on emergency services and hospitals. Anthony Albanese has said he is prepared to sit down and work “constructively” with state premiers on the need for more hospital funding, but has ruled out making any grand funding promises before the election. Labor will fund 50 bulk-billed urgent care clinics, but some experts say this is too few and a short-term fix to a struggling health system. Ahead of the final week of the election campaign, Labor revealed the most significant health commitment made by either party to date; promising a $970m investment in primary health and a boost for infrastructure upgrades in GP practices. The Coalition announced a package to boost regional, rural and remote health, since matched by the opposition. Both parties will reduce the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme co-payment to bring down the cost of medicines. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president, Dr Karen Price, said until the opposition’s announcement, “we had not seen a commitment by either major party to meaningfully invest in general practice patient care”. But she said the Medicare rebate issue was still pressing. The health economist Prof Stephen Duckett said the health election policies of both parties had failed to mention “the elephant in the room – the continuing Covid pandemic”, saying funding for the pandemic’s ongoing impact was lacking.",News/Australia news,Who should I vote for?

5/20/2022,"While the main focus of the election campaign has been on the House of Representatives, the makeup of the new Senate will be crucial to the success of the next government. If Labor forms government it will be hoping for a more sympathetic Senate than the current numbers, which lean to the right. The Coalition and One Nation until recently held half the 76 Senate seats between them. Three seats are held by Jacqui Lambie, Rex Patrick and Stirling Griff, with the remaining 35 held by Labor or the Greens. Each state has 12 senators but at most federal polls, including this one, only half are up for election (as well as two from each of the territories). The voting system means the six places on offer almost always split as three for parties of the left and three for parties of the right – although a few senators and candidates defy a simple left-right classification. It’s typically very difficult for the left or right to win four out of six, so when a 4-2 split is achieved, that makes a big difference to the balance of the Senate. The left currently holds just four out of 12 senators in Queensland, and the Greens have a good chance of gaining a seat from the right. There is also a good chance for the Greens to gain a seat from one of the independents in South Australia. Gains for the left beyond those two are harder to see, but if Labor has a very good night, they could create a 4-2 split in Western Australia or Tasmania. The Coalition is defending three seats in most states, and in many of those states that third seat is vulnerable; either to Labor, the Greens or a rightwing minor party. Three Coalition, two Labor and one Greens were elected in 2019. Labor is defending three seats, but it seems highly likely they will lose their third to the Greens. The Coalition vote seems to be holding up reasonably well, but if the Liberal/National vote drops far enough they could lose a seat to One Nation or the United Australia party. Whatever the result, this state will return another 3-3 split, which won’t shift the midpoint of the Senate. Victoria elected three Coalition senators in 2019, alongside two Labor and one Greens, and the parties are defending the same number of seats in 2022. It seems most likely that this split will be maintained. Labor appears to be making relatively modest gains in Victoria, so there is little prospect of gaining a seat from the right. But if the Coalition’s vote drops significantly it might endanger their third seat, which could be won by a minor rightwing party or an independent such as Derryn Hinch. The Liberal National party is defending three seats, alongside One Nation’s Pauline Hanson and two Labor senators. The vote for both Labor and the Greens appears to be up significantly in Queensland, which would mean there is a good chance of electing three senators from the left: two Labor and one Greens. In that case there would be only three seats left in play for the right. The LNP should retain their first two seats, but a swing against the party will make it hard for them to defend their third candidate, Amanda Stoker. Hanson is the favourite to take that seat, but is also being challenged by the UAP founder, Clive Palmer, and the former Queensland premier Campbell Newman, running for the Liberal Democrats. Western Australia elected three Liberals, two Labor and one Green in 2019, and the senators up for election have the same split. There is some polling evidence that suggests a large swing from the Liberals to Labor, which opens up the possibility of Labor gaining a third seat without defeating the Greens senator, producing a 4-2 split in favour of the left. South Australia elected three Liberals, two Labor and one Green in 2019, but the cohort up for election in 2022 are quite different. It includes Stirling Griff and Rex Patrick, who both hold seats originally won by the Nick Xenophon Team in 2016. Xenophon himself is running again and would be a good chance to regain his seat. It seems unlikely his ticket can retain both of those seats, freeing up one seat for another party. Even if Labor is on track to win the election, it seems more likely the Greens will gain the other seat, producing a 3-2-1 split in favour of the left. Jacqui Lambie regained her seat at the 2019 election, alongside two Liberals, two Labor and one Green. This year’s cohort up for election are three Liberals, two Labor and one Greens. The Jacqui Lambie Network candidate, Tammy Tyrrell, appears to have a real chance of defeating the third Liberal candidate, Eric Abetz. It’s also possible that Labor could win a third seat from the Liberals, as happened in 2007 and 2010. The Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory each have two senators, who serve a three year term. Labor and the Coalition have split each territory 1-1 at every election since these seats were created. There is no prospect of a change in the Northern Territory, where the Country Liberal party will regain the seat they lost when CLP senator Sam McMahon left the party earlier this year. A number of independents are challenging the minister Zed Seselja for his Senate seat, with polls suggesting former Wallaby David Pocock, backed by the Climate 200 group, is the leading challenger. Pocock seems to have a real shot at winning – to pull it off, he needs to enough Labor and Greens voters, and a few Liberals, to give him their first preference.",News/Australia news,Federal election 2022: what are the chances for each party in the Senate and who will win?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/federal-election-2022-senate-parties-who-will-win-prediction-cross-bench-labor-coalition-greens-independents
5/20/2022,"Frank Lampard described Everton’s dramatic Premier League survival as the one of the greatest moments of his career after Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s 85th minute winner completed a stunning comeback against Crystal Palace. Everton trailed Patrick Vieira’s team 2-0 at half-time and looked destined for a fraught relegation fight at Arsenal on the final day. But a stirring second-half recovery, capped by the England international’s late diving header, preserved the club’s 68-year top-flight residence in remarkable style. The victory sparked a huge pitch invasion at Goodison Park. The celebrations were largely peaceful, certainly in comparison to the ugly scenes at Nottingham Forest and Port Vale, but Vieira appeared to kick out at an Everton fan who goaded him after the final whistle. The Palace manager declined to comment on the incident afterwards. Lampard, however, ended the night celebrating in front of jubilant Evertonians while stood on the roof of an executive box. “It is one of the greatest moments of my footballing life and career,” the Everton manager said. “I have been very fortunate to have amazing times, especially at Chelsea as a player and a coach. But when you feel the feelings and desperation of what relegation brings to the table, it is different. You need to dig in. You lose games, you fight to do something and then you lose another game. People think you should fly up the table and it is never that way. “Coming in here three and a half months ago with my amazing staff, positive people who work so hard, and trying to affect things and getting a reaction from the players, from the fans and feeling unity when it looked split. This club is special and I am proud to be manager of Everton on this night. “I am full of thanks tonight; thanks to the fans for taking me on board, to the board for taking me on at a difficult time when we appeared to be going in the wrong direction, and to the players. That was down to the players.” Lampard’s half-time introduction of Dele Alli helped turn the game in Everton’s favour. The nature of the comeback, and the stakes involved, produced an emotional outpouring on the final whistle. The Everton manager added: “I thought I might cry [at full time], I thought I might jump out of my body. Nobody can question the celebrations at the end. “It is easy to say: ‘But you haven’t won anything.’ You know what, come and work at this club for a few months and see the difficulties and what it means to people to stay in this league. “See us 2-0 down at half-time, playing poorly, ridiculous second goal and then see the character they showed. See the fans on the pitch in good heart and spirit. They have pulled us over the line, they have been more than a 12th man. “But the players also deserve huge credit. An amazing night. Dele was brilliant when he came on. He changed the game individually. We had already changed the system but it was to give a little bit of information. “It was nothing to do with a system change to change the game, it was always going to be the players, their character and desire to engage the crowd and make something happen. “I can’t take too much credit. I didn’t come up with some new magical tactics. We went direct, but no problem in this position. But we relied on the players.” On the pitch invasion itself Lampard said: “It was pure elation of fans who have come on the pitch after avoiding relegation. If it is done in the right way let them stay on the pitch, let them have their moment. As long as they behave, no problem.” Vieira was deeply unhappy with Palace’s second half display, their having silenced the Goodison crowd to lead through Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew after 45 minutes. “All that changed was that we didn’t respect the game as well as we did in the first half,” the Palace manager said. “We were inviting too much pressure and we didn’t move the ball quick enough and allowed them to build that momentum and confidence. It is about managing the game when winning 2-0 and we didn’t do that well enough in the second half. We gave them hope and when we invited pressure they scored one goal, two goals, three goals – when we conceded that first goal it made it difficult for us.”",Sport/Football,‘One of the greatest moments of my life’: Lampard revels in Everton survival,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/one-of-the-greatest-moments-of-my-life-lampard-revels-in-everton-survival
5/20/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of people struggling to sleep are to be offered treatment via an app instead of sleeping pills in the biggest shake-up of guidelines for insomnia in decades. Until now, people with insomnia have typically been given advice about sleep hygiene or prescribed sleeping pills. Now they could be offered a £45 app-based treatment programme on the NHS instead of pills, under new guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice). Nice is recommending Sleepio as an effective alternative for the first time, saving the NHS cash and reducing prescriptions of drugs which can be addictive. An analysis found healthcare costs were lower when using Sleepio, mostly because of fewer GP appointments and sleeping pills prescribed, Nice said. The app uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to provide people with tailored digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). As many as 800,000 people could benefit from the new guidelines in England. “Until now people with insomnia have been offered sleeping pills and taught about sleep hygiene, so our committee’s recommendation of Sleepio provides GPs and their patients with a new treatment option,” said Jeanette Kusel, the acting director for MedTech and digital at Nice. “Our rigorous, transparent and evidence-based analysis has found that Sleepio is cost saving for the NHS compared with usual treatments in primary care. It will also reduce people with insomnia’s reliance on dependence-forming drugs such as zolpidem and zopiclone. “This is a good example of where a digital health technology can help the NHS. The evidence has shown using Sleepio reduces the number of GP appointments people with insomnia need and will also cut the number of prescriptions for sleeping pills delivered by pharmacists.” The app offers a digital six-week self-help programme involving a sleep test, weekly interactive CBT-I sessions and keeping a diary about their sleeping patterns. The sessions focus on identifying thoughts, feelings and behaviours that contribute to the symptoms of insomnia. Cognitive interventions aim to improve how a patient thinks about sleep, and behavioural interventions aim to promote a healthy sleep routine. The programme is designed to be completed in six weeks, but under the new guidelines people will have full access to it for 12 months from registration. This will allow NHS patients to complete the sessions at their own pace and revisit sessions, Nice said. Participants can also access electronic library articles, online tools and join the online Sleepio user community for support. A daily sleep diary helps users track their progress and the programme tailors advice to individuals. Users can fill in the diary manually or the data can be automatically uploaded from a compatible wearable tracking device, like an Apple watch or Fitbit. Clinical evidence presented to Nice’s medical technologies advisory committee from 12 randomised controlled trials showed that Sleepio is more effective at reducing insomnia than sleep hygiene and sleeping pills. The cost of Sleepio is £45 per person and will also save the NHS money, Nice said. This is based on an analysis of primary care resource use data before and after Sleepio was introduced in nine GP practices.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Insomniacs in England to be offered app treatment instead of sleeping pills ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/20/insomniacs-in-england-to-be-offered-app-treatment-instead-of-sleeping-pills
5/20/2022,"Consumer confidence in the UK has fallen to the lowest level since records began in 1974 amid growing concern over the cost of living crisis. Stoking fears that Britain is heading for a recession caused by the squeeze on family budgets, the latest monthly snapshot showed consumers are now gloomier about their prospects than they were during the 2008 financial crisis. Almost all confidence measures tracked by the polling firm GfK fell in May, continuing a steep decline from April when households were hit by record increases in energy bills after the rise in the Ofgem price cap. The headline UK consumer confidence index, a measure of how people view their personal finances and the wider economic outlook, dropped by two percentage points to -40 in May, surpassing the previous record low of -39 set in July 2008 when the global banking system was imploding. Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, said: “This means consumer confidence is now weaker than in the darkest days of the global banking crisis, the impact of Brexit on the economy, or the Covid shutdown.” Economists warned in April when the index dropped to -38 that such a low reading was consistent with Britain’s economy falling into recession, because it had closely tracked UK GDP over the past five decades. “That correlation has been robust to many economic regimes and shocks, from 1970s stagflation to the great moderation and the financial crisis,” said Robert Wood, UK economist at the Bank of America. “Consumer confidence matters because it gives an early, reliable, signal.” UK inflation rose to 9% in April, the highest level since the early 1980s, as hard-pressed families come under mounting pressure from soaring energy bills, record petrol prices and the rising cost of the weekly shop. It comes as the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine ripples through global oil and gas markets, exacerbating a post-lockdown surge in prices. Economists expect the historic hit to living standards to lead to consumers tightening their belts as soaring prices for essentials such as food, fuel and energy force them to cut back on other purchases. Official figures show retail sales fell by more than expected in March, while industry data suggests the spending slump continued in April as households grappled with the record 54% rise in gas and electricity bills. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that Britain’s economy runs a heightened risk of recession as inflation heads towards 10%. GfK said its index measure based on asking consumers about their plans for big-ticket purchases had decreased for each of the past six months. Consumer pessimism was most evident in people’s views on the general economy, with an index score of -63 for the past year and -56 for the coming year. Figures from the Office for National Statistics published on Thursday showed a six percentage point weekly fall in UK credit and debit card spending last week, as well as a 10 point drop in the number of seated diners in restaurants. However, the figures come after the early May bank holiday weekend, when sales rose sharply. The ONS said the rising cost of materials and energy were the top concern for UK companies. As many as 26% of businesses said rising costs were their main concern this month, up from 24% in April 2022, followed by 20% who said soaring energy prices were the biggest worry. Joe Staton, from GfK, added: “Even the Bank of England is pessimistic, with governor Andrew Bailey this week offering no hope of tackling inflation. The outlook for consumer confidence is gloomy, and nothing on the economic horizon shows a reason for optimism any time soon.”",News/Business,UK consumer confidence falls to lowest level since 1974,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/20/uk-consumer-confidence-falls-to-lowest-level-since-1974
5/20/2022,"Eligibility for telephone voting will be expanded to allow Covid-positive Australians to vote in Saturday’s election. On Thursday the Australian Electoral Commission admitted that more than 100,000 people had been caught by an anomaly that could have prevented them voting: they tested positive after the cutoff to apply for a postal ballot but too soon to qualify for telephone voting. But on Friday morning the AEC said it had recommended problem be fixed to allow anyone who tested positive after 6pm last Friday to use telephone voting. The fix follows strong criticism from Australians prevented from having their say in the election and a legal threat from the independent candidate for Kooyong, Monique Ryan. Ryan, who is challenging the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, had announced she would bring an urgent federal court case against the special minister of state, Ben Morton, to fix the issue. Scott Morrison confirmed eligibility had been expanded to prevent disenfranchisement of Covid-positive people. Asked on Friday if he agreed all Australians should be able to vote, Morrison told 6PR Radio: “Yeah I do.” “What we’ve been waiting on is for the electoral commissioner, the special minister of state he’s been working with the commissioner in recent days, and we’ve been waiting for [his] advice on how he believes this can be fixed,” he said. “We’ve received that advice now, and they’ll be expanding eligibility to people who tested positive after 6pm last Friday, that’s the recommendation of the electoral commissioner. “He’s worked through the logistics of all of that, what that means, on the call centres and all of those sorts of things, the practical issues that he has to be satisfied of.” The government is now consulting with the opposition to get bipartisan approval to make new regulations expanding the eligibility for telephone voting. Morton said the government had “immediately acted on advice provided by the AEC this morning”. “Any voter who has tested positive for Covid-19 after 6pm Friday 13th May will be able to access the secure telephone voting service,” he said. “It is important that every Australian who is enrolled and entitled to vote, be able to exercise their democratic right and this change ensures that.” Earlier Morrison said: “We want to make sure Australians have as much opportunity as they should in a democracy to vote.” He told ABC News Breakfast: “We will take [the commissioner’s] advice. It is not something for politicians to interfere in. We have an independent process, but we are ensuring the commissioner has every support that he can conduct the election in the best possible way.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australian electoral commissioner, Tom Rogers, said: “The telephone voting service was legislated by Parliament as an emergency measure for individuals who had no other voting option once postal vote applications closed at 6pm on Wednesday.” Rogers said the AEC “cannot change the eligibility criteria but have certainly heard the concerns expressed by members of the public who tested positive to Covid-19 prior to 6pm on Tuesday and had not cast an early vote or applied for a postal vote”. “We have analysed the service’s take-up so far, our staffing levels and forecasts for use, and are in urgent discussions with Government about the concerns expressed by members of the public,” he said. “This morning I have signed a brief recommending for the eligibility for the service be expanded.”",News/Australia news,Telephone voting rules changed to allow Australians with Covid to vote in federal election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/telephone-voting-rules-changed-to-allow-australians-with-covid-to-vote-in-federal-election
5/20/2022,"Respiratory syncytial virus is killing 100,000 children under the age of five every year worldwide, new figures reveal as experts say the global easing of coronavirus restrictions is causing a surge in cases. RSV is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory infection in young children. It spreads easily via coughing and sneezing. There is no vaccine or specific treatment. RSV-attributable acute lower respiratory infections led to more than 100,000 deaths of children under five in 2019, according to figures published in the Lancet. Of those, more than 45,000 were under six months old, the first-of-its-kind study found. More children are likely to be affected by RSV in the future, experts believe, because masks and lockdowns have robbed children of natural immunity against a range of common viruses, including RSV. “RSV is the predominant cause of acute lower respiratory infection in young children and our updated estimates reveal that children six months and younger are particularly vulnerable, especially with cases surging as Covid-19 restrictions are easing around the world,” said the study’s co-author, Harish Nair of the University of Edinburgh. “The majority of the young children born in the last two years have never been exposed to RSV (and therefore have no immunity against this virus).” The figures in the Lancet include data from 113 studies. Around the globe in 2019, there were 33m RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infections in children aged under five, leading to 3.6m hospital admissions, 26,300 in-hospital deaths, and 101,400 RSV-attributable deaths. This accounts for about one in 50 – or 2% – of annual deaths from any cause in this age range. For infants under six months old, there were 6.6m RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection episodes globally in 2019. There were 1.4m hospital admissions, 13,300 hospital deaths, and 45,700 overall deaths attributable to RSV. Overall, 97% of RSV deaths in children under five occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Earlier this year a UK charity warned parents of young children to be on the alert for signs of RSV after a sharp rise in cases. The British Lung Foundation said an estimated 1,000 children had needed hospital care for the condition in England alone in just three months. In some cases, RSV can lead to bronchiolitis, an inflammatory infection that can make it hard to breathe. The early symptoms are similar to those of a common cold but can develop over a few days into a high temperature, a dry and persistent cough, difficulty feeding, and wheezing.",News/Society,"Respiratory syncytial virus kills 100,000 under-fives every year",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/19/respiratory-syncytial-virus-under-fives-respiratory-infection-covid
