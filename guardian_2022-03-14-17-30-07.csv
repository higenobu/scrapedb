3/14/2022,"Enedina Avilés sits on a rocky ledge surveying the city below. She comes to this spot every evening after spending the day earning a living peeling garlic cloves. “This is her moment of meditation,” says Peruvian photographer Alex Kornhuber. Avilés’s home, a wooden shack with no running water or electricity, is perched on a hillside on the southern outskirts of Lima. She lived in the mountains for most of her life but moved to the city seven years ago after visiting her son and finding a small patch of land where she could build a house. Enedina Avilés lives in the Villa María del Triunfo district. Every evening, she sits on a rock high on a cliff to absorb the landscape – a contemplative practice that benefits her mental health. Kornhuber first met Avilés, 67, in March 2020; since then he has visited her 10 times, getting to know her better each time. Her life has been one of “heartbreaking” hardships, he says. Given away at birth to landowners, she raised livestock until she married at 15. She had seven children, two of whom died, and endured years of physical abuse by her husband. “She has diabetes and high blood pressure but is happy where she is, even though to most of us, it’s a desperate situation,” says Kornhuber. Avilés is one of dozens of older people Kornhuber has met over the past two years of an ambitious project to document how Peruvians age in different parts of the country. In 2019, he won a fellowship with the Global Brain Health Institute, which brings together people from diverse disciplines and professions to inform new approaches to brain health across the world. Catalina Betancurt, 80, from Choquecancha, Cusco region, a widow who raises guinea pigs in her kitchen. Healthy and cheerful, the only indication of cognitive decline is that she’s not sure if she gave birth to four children or not. After a year of researching neurodegenerative diseases and health policy, Kornhuber travelled across the country, from the riverside city of Pucallpa in the Amazon to Nazca in the arid south. He partnered with Dr Maritza Pintado-Caipa, a neurologist and another GBHI fellow, who has spent the past five years trying to raise awareness of dementia and other neurological conditions, a challenge in a country where the symptoms of diseases such as Alzheimer’s are often dismissed as simply part of getting old, even by other medics. “After I studied neurology in Lima I returned to my home city of Tacna in the south expecting to work, but the regional health director told me there were no neurological disorders in the city – because they had never collected any data on them. For two months I had no patients because no one understood what I did.” Kornhuber and Pintado-Caipa began to build a picture of a forgotten generation of older Peruvians, ignored by the state, leaving their families to carry the burden of care. This was nothing new for Pintado-Caipa, who has spent years trying to persuade authorities to invest in research, training and equipment to support people with dementia. Teodosa Marchán, 66, in Pajaritos, Tumbes region. Her cognitive health rapidly deteriorated when her husband died 10 years ago. Now she is looked after by one of her sisters. “Our physicians are more worried about infectious diseases. If you have to provide money for something then you have to prioritise and we are not a developed country. But we could do more for people [who are affected],” says Pintado-Caipa. “Those who are seen by doctors are often told that forgetfulness is a normal part of ageing and sent on their way.” But the lack of support for older people and their carers came as a surprise to Kornhuber. “Although I’ve been travelling my country all my life and had seen this [lack of support], now, focusing on elders, it became much more obvious and sad,” he says. “Elders [in Peru] are abandoned. We don’t want to think about old age, we don’t want to look like them.” Rodolfo Zapata, 76, and granddaughter Maciel at home in Urban, Tumbes region. Rodolfo lives surrounded by family who respect and love him. These bonds are essential for his mental wellbeing. Not all of the older people they saw had a neurological disorder, but they all faced hardships that were exacerbated by the pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic began as Kornhuber embarked on the project, adding an unexpected dimension to the research. Renowned Shipibo-Konibo ceramist Agustina Valera, 66, left, from San Francisco, Ucayali region. She exhibits her work in Peru and internationally. Rosa Fernández, right, aged about 100, at home in Choquecancha, Cusco region. Rosa is illiterate and speaks only Quechua; her knees hurt but she still cooks and performs other household chores. Peru had the highest death rate per capita in the world, a result of a desperately ill-equipped health system, lack of medical supplies, overcrowded housing and a huge informal economy. Many older people had no choice but to continue fending for themselves. “I met one man with a walking frame. He was 88 but lived alone and had to go out to buy food and medicine,” says Kornhuber. The resilience was what struck Kornhuber above all else, particularly in the mountain communities, where, he believes, a connection to nature and a strong community network help protect against neurological disorders. Fortunata Pfuturi, left, who is aged about 90, at home in Rukha, Cuzco region. Three generations meet in the kitchen: Fortunata, her daughter Dora and her granddaughter. “People are illiterate but they have accumulated a lot of knowledge … and they have wisdom and are respected.” For Kornhuber, the project provided a unique chance to connect with families. “I found that focusing on elders has opened doors for me. When I said I was interested in people’s grandparents, they invited me in. In 30 years of being a photographer, I’ve never had such openness. People wanted to tell their stories. “Peru is a very diverse country but people don’t know each other. [By showing the photographs] I was able to introduce them to each other. This was probably the most rewarding part of the project for me,” says Kornhuber. Juana Guzmán, 88, and her daughter Juana Cuena, 60, in Infierno, Madre de Dios region. Six years ago, when her husband died, Juana Sr had sudden behavioural changes. Juana Jr took her from the Amazonian hamlet where she lived to her own house, near Puerto Maldonado, the region’s capital. His goal now is to create a website to bring the project to a wider public, featuring photos and stories of the people he has met and information from doctors such as Pintado-Caipa highlighting what healthy ageing means. “You can’t help but project yourself – how will I end up? Whenever you see an older person who is active and resilient, it is so inspiring.” Alex Kornhuber’s photographs will be on display at the Naughton Institute, Trinity College Dublin, during the inaugural Creative Brain Week (12-16 March), an event highlighting the intersection of the arts and brain science Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,‘Wisdom and respect’: what Peru’s forgotten generation can teach us about life and ageing,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/14/wisdom-and-respect-what-perus-forgotten-generation-can-teach-us-about-life-and-ageing
3/14/2022,"Where was Harry Kane? Where was Son Heung-min? Where was Antonio Conte’s ability to make decisive in-game, narrative-changing tactical switches? Sure, Manchester United were shaky and required Cristiano Ronaldo to rescue all three points. Last month the Italian’s masterplan had Kane and Son turning Manchester City over via blitzkrieg counter-attacking. This is how Tottenham play. This is the Conte masterplan. And if it doesn’t work he seems to have nothing else. Against United his two star forwards did not have enough impact on the contest and Conte needed to find a way for them or others to do so. It was instructive that Spurs’s best moments were the very rareoccasionswhere they managed to flood United with numbers One of these led to the penalty that Kane scored. Perhapsthat was a clue to how Conte might vary the side’s play. Jamie Jackson Match report: Manchester United 3-2 Tottenham With every game and new victory under their belts, Arsenal’s young, joyful squad seem to unlock another new level of confidence. Against Leicester, they were sublime, with Martin Ødegaard and Thomas Partey dominating the midfield and creatinga platform for their teammates to overwhelm Leicester with their fluid, quick and precise passing combinations. Arsenal have now won five games in a row, they returned to fourth place in the league and by the end of the game fans were punctuating every slick one-touch pass with cries of “olé!” After spending much of Mikel Arteta’s time as manager working to create a new identity, they are doing so while also being one of the most watchable teams in the league. Tumaini Carayol Match report: Arsenal 2-0 Leicester If these are to be Antonio Rüdiger’s final weeks in a Chelsea shirt, the club’s supporters had better cherish them because they will not find another centre-half like him. Against Newcastle, he was typically quick to push himself to the front of any argument while there was classic shithousery in stoppage-time when he refused to return the ball with the required speed and decency. Rüdiger was booked. Fans love a bit of aggro, players that never back down and Rüdiger is something of a throwback in this regard. He defends with the same attitude but he also injects energy, maybe with a charge back to win the ball or even a surge up the field. Chelsea face losing Rüdiger as a free agent in the summer as they cannot offer new contracts under the terms of their special licence. Little wonder they are arguing hard against the sanction. They want, at least, to have a shot at keeping a cult hero. David Hytner Match report: Chelsea 1-0 Newcastle If it looks like a red card, feels like a red card, it probably is a red card. Except that isn’t how VAR works. Jürgen Klopp, having seen Brighton goalkeeper Robert Sánchez escape further punishment for wiping out Luis Díaz as the Colombian gave Liverpool the lead, articulated the issue well. There is a sense that referees currently hesitate to give red cards knowing there are eyes in the sky. But those with the monitors cannot make a call unless there is a “clear and obvious” error. It is self-defeating. Ultimately, decisions need be right or wrong. There will always be a degree of subjectivity, but officiating must becollective. That includes VAR. “It happens constantly,” said Klopp. “Why do we have these discussions after games still if somebody is watching?” Sam Dalling Match report: Brighton 0-2 Liverpool Aston Villa had won their previous three games, scoring nine goals without conceding, but at West Ham they barely mustered a threat other thanthe corner that led to a Danny Ings effort pushed onto the post by Lukasz Fabianski and then Jacob Murphy’s late consolation. They struggled to make an impression. While that may in part be down to their own legginess, it also says a lot about how organised West Ham are and what a good holding midfield pair they have in Declan Rice and Tomas Soucek. Between them they made eight tackles and interceptions plus six clearances. West Ham are clearly a very hard side to play against. Jonathan Wilson Match report: West Ham 2-1 Aston Villa As, two minutes after stepping off the bench, Joe Gelhardt scored a 94th-minute winner for Leeds, Jesse Marsch leapt so high in the air it seemed he might fly over Elland Road. “That’s as high as I can jump,” said Marcelo Bielsa’s successor as he celebrated his first win in three attempts. “In America we call it a credit card celebration.” Marsch speaks with an impressive amalgam of intelligence, humour and humanity but he was fortunate that Patrick Bamford was around to start his first game since September. If 19-year-old Gelhardt clinched the vital points after Kenny McLean’s 91st-minute equaliser, Bamford’s first-half movement played a big part in both creating Rodrigo’s opener – when serving as a decoy – and placing Leeds in control. It was no coincidence Norwich got into the game afterBamford failed to reappear for the second half. Louise Taylor Match report: Leeds 2-1 Norwich It was an unfortunate treble for Michael Keane. In Everton’s last three league games, he has been culpable for Manchester City’s winner, scored for Tottenham and been dropped even as Frank Lampard changed system to include an extra centre-back. That Jonjoe Kenny, a right-back by trade, was preferred in the back three was an indictment of a defender in the England team just 16 months ago. Perhaps Lampard’s decision served as merciful release for Keane; a confidence player lacks confidence at the moment. Maybe Kenny’s unravelling, sent off for two bookings in swift succession, will put Keane back in against Newcastle. Yet Kenny’s rashness and Ben Godfrey being outjumped by Conor Coady for Wolves’ winner highlighted how Everton could do with a £30m England centre-back at the top of his game. Richard Jolly Match report: Everton 0-1 Wolves How Watford would love to build on a rare win. Victory at Southampton was their second in 18 matches but they face a 20-day break before their next game, a trip to Liverpool. After that, three of their next four matches are at home to what Roy Hodgson described as “catchable” opponents, in Brentford, Leeds and Burnley, who have two games in hand. Not that Hodgson will be able to get much work into his squad, the majority heading off on international duty. “Ray [Lewington] and I would have been turning cartwheels at the thought we could have three weeks with the team without a game to really work on what we’re trying to do,” he said. “But the trouble is they’re all going away to far-flung corners of the world. If we’re lucky, they’ll do one session with us and then they’ll be on a coach goingup to the hotel in Liverpool.” Ben Fisher Match report: Southampton 1-2 Watford Ivan Toney delivered victory for Brentford against Burnley, who were resilient for 86 minutes – yet the new box office Bee, Christian Eriksen, was the creator. The Brentford head coach, Thomas Frank, stated that his Danish compatriot could become the club’s best ever signing. Fresh back-to-back Premier League victories will ensure likely survival for Brentford. If others hesitated on Eriksen, Frank trusted his intuition. Four Burnley opponents were left rigid by a clip of an Eriksen boot for Toney to head home. And the Bees can look forward to similar manoeuvres in their nine remaining games. For Sean Dyche’s side, aiming to avoid the drop, it was harsh. For Brentford , with Eriksen’s trademark calm amid edgy moments, improvements appear guaranteed. Julian Taylor Match report: Brentford 2-0 Burnley Tottenham attempted 24 crosses of which only one found a white shirt and none led to a shot – but despite that they still managed to score from two of them. Meanwhile, despite the presence in their attack of one of the greatest headers of the ball in the history of the game, United attempted a relatively demure 10, two of which Cristiano Ronaldo converted. In United’s current set-up two full-backs and two wide forwards provide width, so it is probably no surprise that only Jadon Sancho (one), Marcus Rashford (three) and left-back Alex Telles (six) attempted a cross. That Diogo Dalot did not should come as no surprise: in seven of his 11 starts he has not crossed at all. With Ronaldo in the middle and Tottenham proving it’s worth just getting it in the mixer, perhaps they should have a go more often.

3/14/2022,"We are woefully underserved by the current conversation about Islamophobia. In recent weeks, the debate has hinged on whether or not the government’s decision to introduce new national counter-extremism legislation on the basis of the bogus “Trojan horse” letter, which was full of anti-Muslim tropes, was Islamophobic. Research has suggested that middle-class Britons hold more prejudiced views of Islam than any other social group. And a Tory minister recently alleged she was sacked for her “Muslimness”. In all these stories, Islamophobia is approached at worst as a political gaffe, and at best a moral failing, allegation or faux pas. At the same time, mainstream news outlets have reported that Russia’s war in Ukraine is horrific because it is taking place somewhere that is “not like Iraq or Afghanistan”. Journalists have suggested that Ukrainian refugees deserve to be welcomed because they are “not from Syria”. Such coverage is not only shot through with Islamophobia, but premised upon it. References to Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria evoke wars associated with Muslims that the west justified through its “war on terror”. Unlike “westerners”, a racially and religiously coded marker that one reporter helpfully clarified as meaning Christian and white, the characterisation of Muslims as deserving of, or at least predisposed to, violence means our lives do not carry the same value. We cannot be deemed victims of occupation or war in the same way as Europeans. War is often assumed the natural destiny or perpetual condition of predominantly Muslim countries and their people. As such, the right of Muslims to live free from war and persecution is thrown into doubt. This dynamic is not unique; we have seen it play out in the familiar devaluation of Black lives, too. It is the same dynamic that global border controls reinforce, and which we are witnessing currently in the war in Ukraine, where African students have been actively denied escape routes from war. For Black Muslims, dehumanisation is always compounded – where was the anti-war and pro-refugee sentiment when the US bombed Somalia at the same time that Russia invaded Ukraine? These forms of dehumanisation are all manifestations of white supremacy. Discussing Islamophobia as an embarrassing faux pas at the middle-class dinner table is an astounding diversion from this fact. The ideology of white supremacy devalues lives and justifies dispossession and persecution. It has clear ramifications within Britain: as we speak, the nationality and borders bill is in its final phase in parliament. The controversial clause 9, which the House of Lords has rejected but MPs are yet to agree upon, allows the home secretary to secretly strip people of their citizenship without notifying them. The policy builds on years of extraordinary expansion to such powers, notably the Immigration Act 2014, which allowed the British government to revoke citizenship on often secret grounds, so long as they are “satisfied” that a person will not be made stateless. Making a person stateless is against international law, but this act created a loophole for deprivation of British citizenship even when a person has no citizenship in any other state. Such measures disproportionately target people of colour. The state assumes that we will be eligible for citizenship in other countries (even if we have never visited them). United Nations experts are clear that this specifically threatens the human rights of people of colour “and especially people from Muslim and migrant communities”. Clause 9 is a human rights abuse. Consider the fact that several British Muslims who have reportedly travelled to Syria to distribute aid have had their citizenship stripped and been made stateless. Human rights only apply if you are seen first as human. Islamophobia is not the preserve of a fringe group. It is the common language of the political and media establishment. You are less likely to lose your job over Islamophobia than retain it – Michael Gove remains a top government minister despite ignoring police recommendations that the “Trojan horse” letter was bogus, and pursuing an Islamophobic agenda that has devastated communities in Birmingham. Islamophobic sentiments can even help you become president or prime minister. Islamophobia flourishes, despite the violence it leads to. The recent People’s Review of Prevent painstakingly documented how the government’s Prevent programme undermines safeguarding and free speech. Hundreds of academics and organisations, such as Amnesty, have long agreed that it encourages discrimination. Elsewhere in the world, Muslims are being directly persecuted. Recently, India’s ruling party shared a cartoon on Twitter of Muslims being lynched. Experts warn that calls for anti-Muslim violence have put the country on the path to genocide. Where is the outcry from European states? Mainstream conversations about Islamophobia reflect a racist disregard for life. This is upheld in basic understandings about when violence is justified and when it is not, who can cross borders, whose deaths deserve inquiry, whose citizenship is a right and whose can be stripped away. White supremacy and Islamophobia colour our approach to all of these issues and more. Without confronting this, we will continue down a slippery path. The secret removal of Muslim people’s citizenship brings us one step closer to disappearing Muslims by other means.

3/14/2022,"The fans will be back at Cheltenham this week and they will have a new favourite to roar home as the four-day drama unfolds. For 15 glorious years from 2004, “What’s Ruby on?” was the first question on many punters’ minds before any big race at the Festival. Now “What’s Rachael riding?” will be the starting point before the money goes down, as last season’s leading rider at the meeting attempts to defend her crown. Rachael Blackmore’s six winners at the 2021 Festival proved that sporting history can be made even when there is no one there to remember the moment. She jumped the final flight in silence on the way to victory on Honeysuckle, the favourite, in the Champion Hurdle, the first by a female rider in one of the meeting’s four feature events. A few dozen people, at most, applauded her into the winner’s enclosure afterwards. Quite unlike any other “I was there” moment, it was a soulless experience that none who witnessed it would ever care to repeat. It will reboot the Cheltenham Festival in the post-Covid era like little else if Blackmore can retain her top-jockey status this week with 65,000-plus fans in full voice. Better yet if the only blip at last year’s meeting – her decision to ride A Plus Tard and not the winner, Minella Indo, in the Gold Cup – could be rectified 12 months later. After Blackmore’s groundbreaking success in the Grand National last April, again with no spectators in the stands, it is the only one of the National Hunt’s three biggest races she has yet to win. “It’s probably something that will sink in when you’ve got grey hair and you can enjoy what happened,” she said recently. “I suppose when I came home [from Aintree] and I was driving through my home town of Killenaule and I could see posters in the windows of people’s homes with my face on them, it really resonated then what my personal achievements meant to the people where I’m from. “But it’s a constant, revolving wheel and as a jockey you’re looking forward. It’s always: ‘What’s next?’” Like Walsh in his pomp – and for most of the last 25 years, Frankie Dettori on the Flat – Blackmore is the rider the bookies fear, the one with the potential to eat into their profits like no other if she gets on a roll. And while the wheel may constantly turn, there is a strong sense of deja vu about several of her best chances, adding to the punters’ confidence that what she has done once, she will be able to do again. Jon Pullin, the new clerk of the course at Cheltenham, said ­yesterday that the fields for Tuesday's opening day of the track’s Festival meeting ­tomorrow are “very competitive … with ­numbers of runners comparable to or higher [than] recent years”, even though the National Hunt Chase, the final event on the card, has attracted just seven runners, its smallest field this century.  For the second year in a row, 10 will go to post for the Champion ­Hurdle, which is in line with the 10-year ­average, while a 12-runner field for the Mares’ Hurdle is the ­second-largest in the last five years. An 11-strong field for the Arkle ­Trophy is also well ahead of the five ­runners in 2021, as well as the 10-year ­average of 8.2.  However, the seven-runner field for the National Hunt Chase is the first in single figures this ­century, for a race that attracted 26 ­runners in 2002 and has a 10-year average of 16.5. The Supreme ­Novice ­Hurdle, ­meanwhile, has nine declared ­runners, one more than in 2021 but well below the 10-year ­average of 15.7.Direct comparisons with last year’s Festival are potentially misleading, as owners were banned from ­attending because of Covid-19 restrictions. This may have persuaded some owners with unfancied or so-called “social” ­runners to bypass the meeting.  The small field for the National Hunt Chase, which has attracted just two runners from ­British stables, will still come as a ­surprise to many punters, not least when the idea of expanding the ­meeting to five days is again being floated in some quarters.The going for the first day of the Festival, meanwhile, is expected to be good-to-soft, after plans to continue watering the track were put on hold following 4mm of rain overnight on Saturday.  No further rain is forecast for the track until Wednesday, while Thursday and Friday are expected to be dry and mild.“We are certainly not doing any watering at the moment and we’ll monitor conditions and see how much it dries before making any decision on any further watering,” Pullin said. “Given where we are currently and the forecast ahead, we will be ­somewhere around good-to-soft for the start of the meeting.” Greg Wood Honeysuckle, of course, is the star turn on Tuesday, as she attempts to extend her unbeaten career to 15 races and retain her champion’s status. At around 4-6, she is one for the heavy-hitters, but £5 and £10 punters – not to mention Lady Gaga fans – will be doubling up with Telmesomethinggirl, last year’s Mares’ Novice Hurdle winner, when she lines up as likely favourite for the Mares’ Hurdle 40 minutes later. At current odds, the double would pay a much more rewarding 7-1. Bob Olinger will be a third Blackmore-ridden winner from 2021 attempting a follow-up in Thursday’s Turners Novices’ Chase, while Allaho, the runaway winner of the Ryanair Chase 12 months ago, is odds-on for a repeat success on Thursday. The potential for week-long accas culminating in A Plus Tard in the Gold Cup is obvious and, for the bookmakers, potentially toxic. And yet, unlike her predecessor as the racegoers’ rider-of-choice, Blackmore will not start the meeting as favourite for the top-jockey prize. Paul Townend, who inherited Walsh’s mantle of No 1 rider at the Willie Mullins stable, is a shade of odds-on with most layers to take the award for the second time in three years, with Blackmore as big as 11-2 and Davy Russell, who has a long list of fancied rides for Gordon Elliott, around the same price. Townend was the top Cheltenham jockey in 2020, the first Ruby-less Festival after his retirement in May 2019, and his fairly seamless move into the top job at the Mullins stable should have made him Walsh’s obvious heir with the fans. But he does not have the X-factor – or, for that matter, the XX factor – that Blackmore brings to the proceedings, and while they are the friendliest of rivals, he will also be aboard the most obvious danger to the majority of Blackmore’s key rides.

If, on the other hand, they share out the spoils between them, there is an obvious chance for a rider like Russell to burst through the gap. Russell is very much the grizzled veteran of the narrative – his first Festival winner came as long ago as 2006, in the cross-country. But he has a happy knack of getting on the “right” one from Ireland in the meeting’s handicaps and will get plenty of support from Elliott in that department throughout the week, in addition to several with big chances in the Grade Ones. Townend and Blackmore, by contrast, look mainly to the Graded contests for their winners, and while Mullins has had several handicap winners in recent years, they have often been the second- or third-string in the betting. It is 10-1 bar Blackmore, Townend and Russell – which brings in Nico de Boinville, the leading British-based rider, among others – and the race to be the human face of the 2022 Festival is highly likely to be a three-cornered contest. Blackmore will be the fans’ favourite while Townend heads the bookies’ lists, but Russell could yet be the one to beat them both.",Sport/Sport,Fan favourite Rachael Blackmore looks to defend Cheltenham crown | Greg Wood,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/14/fan-favourite-rachael-blackmore-looks-to-defend-cheltenham-crown
3/14/2022,"Paragraph 175 sounds innocuous enough. A minor piece of legislation, perhaps, or part of those terms and conditions that any one of us would be forgiven for skimming over. But as the award-winning new film Great Freedom makes clear, it was in fact a vindictive article of the German penal code that criminalised male homosexuality and blighted the lives of 140,000 men, more than a third of whom received prison sentences. As well as remaining in force for more than a century, Paragraph 175 exposed a tacit accord between the Nazis – who lowered the threshold for punishment while raising the sentence – and the postwar liberating forces. “Other laws were reset after the war to how they had been before the Nazis,” explains Sebastian Meise, the film’s 46-year-old Austrian director, when we meet in a London office. “But 175 just continued.” A “pink list” of known gay men, which the Nazis had compiled, was still in circulation by the late 1970s, Meise says. “It’s absurd the lengths the state went to in persecuting these men. What struck me most was the allies. For me, they’ve always been the liberators – they freed us from fascism. But in this case, they were on the same level as the Third Reich.” Some men who had been imprisoned in concentration camps were simply transferred straight to prison following the end of the war. In Great Freedom, this is the fate of Hans, played by Franz Rogowski, who spends most of his adult life behind bars. When we first meet him, he is being sent down in 1968 for lewd conduct in a public toilet. Shot by police from behind a two-way mirror, the Super-8 footage of his cottaging exploits carries the frisson of a peep show. Meise used Tearoom, William E Jones’s film containing footage of a real-life 1960s sting operation in the American midwest, as a reference point. If Hans doesn’t look perturbed by his sentence, that’s because he knows he will be reunited with his old cellmate Viktor, played by Georg Friedrich. It is their enduring bond, their acts of selflessness and sacrifice, that suffuse the film with hope where it might have been simply harrowing. Its ingenious flashback structure allows us to see Hans during other spells of imprisonment. Thrown into solitary confinement in one scene in 1968, he emerges from the darkness into 1945. He is gaunt and feeble, with a number tattooed on his forearm. In another scene, he stumbles out of the gloom into 1957, looking healthier and sporting a modest rockabilly haircut. Trends may change but homophobia never falls out of fashion. “We were trying to find a form that expresses the world he is living in,” Meise says of the script he wrote with his regular collaborator, Thomas Reider. “Hans’s life is like a prison. He can’t be someone else, he can’t do time and turn into a ‘better’ person. The punishment doesn’t do anything to him because he is immediately persecuted again. Even being on the outside is a prison. That’s how we arrived at our structure. We wanted to create this feeling that he is trapped in a time loop. Every time he goes back into solitary confinement, in the darkness, he is then spat out somewhere else.” A large part of the film’s magic can be attributed to the extraordinarily tender Rogowski, and his ability to inhabit Hans at different points in his life. “There was one moment where we had to switch overnight between shooting the 1950s and the 1940s,” says Meise. “I saw Franz walk up the stairs and I thought, ‘Jesus Christ, it’s a completely different man’. I really don’t know how he did it.” The film was shot entirely in a former East German prison. “A depressing place. You could feel what went on there. We were not partying, put it that way. A studio would have been more comfortable but, on the other hand, limitations are good. You don’t have too many options for where to put the camera, or what to point it at, and that gives room for creativity.” He could be describing Hans, who must be wily and resourceful if he is to get what he wants. In one scene, he conspires with a fellow inmate to disobey the prison guards during the nightly head count, so that they will both be sent to the same punishment pen where they can huddle together in the cold. “Exactly,” smiles Meise. “Hans has to manage somehow.” During their research, Meise and Reider spoke to many men who had been prosecuted or imprisoned under Paragraph 175. “We approached some of them in a gay cafe in Vienna. It turned out most of them had experiences with the law. One man started telling us that he spent time in prison in the 1960s. His partner of 40 years, who was sitting next to him, said, ‘You never told me that!’ It was such a taboo for the older generation.” He stares out of the window. “I hope they’ve seen the film,” he says softly. A motif of concealment persists throughout Great Freedom. Viktor, an amateur tattooist, offers to disguise the number on Hans’s forearm by transforming it into an illustration. After the war, the prison walls get a new coat of paint, and the inmates are put to work unpicking the SS insignia from military uniforms. What’s underneath, though, is less easily eradicated. The emblems of the Third Reich may have been removed but Paragraph 175, in all its Nazi-fortified fervour, was not repealed until 1994. In 2017, the convictions of 50,000 men were quashed at last. This is a welcome development, though Meise sounds a cautionary note. “You can see it all coming back now in Hungary and Poland,” he says. “There are laws in parts of the US which are similar to section 28 in the UK, where you can’t talk about homosexuality in schools. So many things have been achieved – equal marriage, adoption and so on – but conservative forces are coming back very strongly. Democratic rights are endangered again.” As for the film’s title, it has several possible meanings. The literal one is that it is named after a real Berlin club, seen briefly near the end of the film, that sprang up in the early 1970s. Then there is the irony of slapping the title Great Freedom on a movie in which only two scenes take place beyond the prison walls. “For me, it is not ironic,” says Meise. “Hans doesn’t have freedom when he is released from prison, so it refers to what he finds within himself, maybe the greatest kind we have – the freedom of our minds.” In UK cinemas",Arts/Film,‘On the same level as the Nazis’: the film about Germany’s postwar persecution of gay men,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/14/nazis-film-germany-postwar-persecution-gay-men-great-freedom-sebastian-miese
3/14/2022,"José Escalante looks out over the mile of fine, white sand leading up to the Mayan ruins perched on a bluff over the turquoise Caribbean. A few fishing boats have been pulled up on Tulum’s Playa Pescadores, one of the world’s most photogenic beaches. Tourists pose as the sun fades over the Yucatán peninsula behind them. All seems well in paradise. But Escalante is weary. He is selling the six beachfront hotels he co-owns in this booming Mexican tourist destination and has a long list of reasons why: the increasingly unmanageable quantities of seaweed washing up on the beach, the large chains with few local connections opening restaurants and beach bars, and organised crime, which makes security a worry. He also has a bigger, existential concern. “Climate change is definitely one of the reasons I am selling,” he says. Almost all the infrastructure in Quintana Roo state is concentrated in a coastal ribbon of beach resorts and timeshare properties, especially from Tulum to Cancún, about 80 miles (130km) to the north. Air-conditioned white minivans filled with tourists buzz over hot asphalt as palms stand by on parade. But this land is in a perilous position. Rises in sea level driven by the climate crisis could reach 40cm (15in) by 2050, says Ruth Cerezo-Mota, an oceanographer at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), with four to 20 metres of beach lost. This “would mean chaos”, says Christian Appendini, a coastal engineer at UNAM. “All the beaches in front of urban developments would probably disappear unless drastic nature-based beach restoration measures are taken.” The 700-mile coast of Quintana Roo has been eroded at a rate of 1.2 metres a year, with some parts losing up to 4.9 metres a year, according to Mexico’s tourism ministry. Beaches are disappearing, and some are only maintained artificially with sand dredged from the seabed. Often they are little more than strips of sand, no wider than a dirt road. Sometimes the strand has completely vanished, leaving waves breaking against the walls of swimming pools, restaurants and houses. Hurricanes are expected to increase in intensity due to higher ocean temperatures, leading to storm surges and exacerbating beach erosion. In 2005, Cancún lost large swaths of an eight-mile beach after Hurricane Wilma, which were later artificially restored, and then hit again by Hurricane Dean two years later. In 2020, the Riviera Maya region experienced 17 tropical storms and 13 hurricanes in one of the most active hurricane seasons on record. Algal blooms have also plagued the coast of the Riviera Maya, a phenomenon scientists have linked to warming sea temperatures. The beachfront along the coast is frequently lined with mounds of rotting black seaweed. In Tulum, the seaweed is often stacked high in piles with workers shovelling it on to wheelbarrows on the shore and hotel owners despairing over where to put it all. Yet as the region starts to rebound from the pandemic – about 12.5 million tourists visited Quintana Roo last year – experts say few are thinking about the climate crisis. Last year, the Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, announced the construction of a new international airport in Tulum and the huge Tren Maya rail project will further accelerate development. At least 91 big tourist projects are under construction in the state, according to the Mexican environmental watchdog Bios Política. Quintana Roo’s second largest city, Playa del Carmen, grew from a population of 63,000 in 2000 to 333,000 in 2020, the Mexican census found. It is the fastest growth rate of any municipality in Latin America, according to the city government. This development is worsening the region’s problems, Escalante says: “I think the way hotels are built has probably contributed more to the loss of the beaches than sea level rise.” Resorts have been built on the dunes, cutting the process of beach formation in a phenomenon known as coastal squeeze. Gene Towle, of the Mexican property consultancy Softec, says: “The real-estate market in the Cancún-Riviera Maya region is not very sophisticated – nobody is thinking long term or about climate change. “I think there is a window of about three years before developers start feeling the economic effects of environmental degradation,” says Jennifer Ruiz-Ramírez, an oceanographer at the University of Quintana Roo. “That is how long it will take for tourists to figure out that the reality no longer corresponds to the image they are being sold.” There are some signs that the reality of the climate crisis may be slowly dawning on parts of the Riviera Maya tourism industry. In 2019, the Quintana Roo government entered into the world’s first coral reef insurance policy with premiums paid by hotel owners as well as the local government. The first payout of $800,000 (£590,000) came in 2020 after Hurricane Delta damaged reefs and beaches. International action could also affect the industry. In June 2021, the G7 group of rich democracies backed the mandatory reporting of climate-related financial risks by publicly traded companies. This would make beachfront investments a potential liability. In Cancún, 22 resorts are projected to experience partial flooding every year by 2050, says Daniel Scott, a geographer at Canada’s University of Waterloo. “It could take about three years before the decision by the G7 is implemented,” says Scott. “But when that happens institutional investors will start selling high-risk properties on the coast.” Escalante could be the first of many seeking to sell their investments while the market still has its dazzle. He does not expect to have much trouble selling his hotels during the present boom – he has never had less than full occupancy in Tulum’s tourist season. “It was a truly great business,” says Escalante. But the writing is on the wall, he feels: “I was in Cancún recently and the beaches were just like they were after Hurricane Wilma 15 years ago.” The reporting on this story was enabled by the Netherlands’ Steunfonds Freelance Journalistiek.",News/Environment,Sun sets on Mexico’s paradise beaches as climate crisis hits home,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/14/mexico-cancun-beaches-tourism-sea-levels-climate-crisis-quintana-roo
3/14/2022,"The Northern Territory police association has rejected calls for the banning of guns in remote Aboriginal communities after the shooting death of Kumanjayi Walker. Walker’s family and Warlpiri elders from the community of Yuendumu, where the shooting occurred, called for the ban on Friday after police officer Zachary Rolfe was found not guilty of the 19-year-old’s murder. But the president of the NT police association, Paul McCue, said on Monday that the union did not support a ban. “This was a sad and unfortunate incident,” he said. “It was avoidable, but members of the police force have the right to protect themselves, and to protect others. “They put their lives on the line to do that, and we do not support the removal of firearms.” McCue, who started his press conference on Monday by reading a 14-page statement before taking questions, said police had been in remote communities for decades and did an unbelievably good job. “I’ve worked in them before, many of the officers here work really closely with members of remote communities, and become really good friends with a lot of those communities. “We deal with a lot of really difficult situations, we know there’s a lot of alcohol-related harm issues in those communities, and police do an amazing job to resolve the majority of those matters without needing force, and occasionally they need to use force.” Outside court on Friday, Ned Jampinjinpa Hargreaves, a Warlpiri elder, said: “Karrinjarla muwajarri. No guns! No guns in the rural remote community! Enough is enough! It’s gotta stop. “To our people – let us stand strong. Let us respect each other. And we do not want to see another black young fella, or a girl, to be shot.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It is unclear whether Rolfe will return to the force, with McCue saying he had yet to speak to the officer, or senior police, about his future. Rolfe has returned with his parents to Canberra after the court decision. McCue used most of his press conference and statement to demand a fulsome inquiry into why Rolfe was charged within four days of the shooting on 9 November 2019. He said constables, sergeants and senior sergeants had told the union they had left the force because of their concern about how the matter was investigated, but was unable to say exactly how many officers he believed had quit because of how Rolfe was treated. The inquest, expected to be held later this year, should illuminate issues with the investigation, including for Walker’s family, McCue said. “We hope this process uncovers more answers for our members, and uncovers all the truths. “Together with Constable Rolfe, his family, the police force itself, along with Kumanjayi Walker’s family, and the community of Yuendumu, they were let down by a decision which was unnecessarily hasty, a decision we know was made within hours of the shooting, to move toward an arrest of a member of the police force who himself was a victim of a stabbing and could have lost his life that night.”",News/Australia news,NT police association rejects calls for gun ban following Zachary Rolfe trial,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/nt-police-association-rejects-calls-for-gun-ban-following-zachary-rolfe-trial
3/14/2022,"Another Australian soldier has testified he watched Ben Roberts-Smith machine-gun an unarmed disabled man to death in Afghanistan, telling the federal court he turned to a comrade immediately after the shooting and said: “Did we just witness an execution?” In further evidence before the federal court about an SAS mission on a compound called Whiskey 108, the soldier, anonymised before the court as Person 24, said he saw Roberts-Smith throw the man to the ground and “immediately put a machine gun burst into his back”. Person 24, a former SAS soldier and veteran of several tours of Afghanistan, was subpoenaed by three newspapers to give evidence in Roberts-Smith’s defamation trial. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing, including the newspaper’s claims regarding Whiskey 108. Giving evidence on Monday, Person 24 said his patrol had led SAS troops into the village of Kakarak, a known insurgent stronghold in southern Uruzgan province, late in the afternoon of 12 April 2009. His six-man patrol set up a security cordon around a bombed-out compound, given the codename Whiskey 108, while other troops assaulted the compound and secured it. After the compound was secured, Person 24 says he was standing guard outside, about two metres from another soldier, Person 14, when he saw Roberts-Smith emerge through a doorway. Person 24 said he saw Roberts-Smith from side-on and did not see his face, but recognised him from his size, his gait, and his “physical demeanour”. “Mr Roberts-Smith walked out of the compound … at this stage he was holding a man in his hand, it appeared he [the man] had come off the ground, he was being held by his pants or back of the shirt.” Person 24 said it was clear the man was alive: “He was making a noise as he came out … a grunting noise.” “He [Roberts-Smith] marched about 15 metres directly out – he dropped the man on to the ground – and immediately put a machine gun burst into his back.” Person 24 said the machine-gun burst was “eight to 10 rounds”. Person 24 told the court the slain man – whose identity has not been revealed in court – might have been a “medium-value target potentially” as an “IED [improvised explosive device] facilitator”. But he was not a “kill target” at the time of the mission. “In BRS’s defence, he might have been a kill target previously.” Person 24 said he “didn’t agree with the agenda” of some SAS soldiers who were seeking to undermine Roberts-Smith’s reputation and decorations. “I still don’t agree with the fact BRS [Roberts-Smith] is here, under extreme duress, for killing bad dudes we went there to kill.” Person 24 told the court after the Australian troops assaulted and secured another compound – Whiskey 109 – his patrol walked back past Whiskey 108. He said he saw the body of the man with a prosthetic leg. He saw another soldier, Person 6, remove the leg, strap it to his backpack, and take it from the battlefield. The leg was taken back to the Australian base in Tarin Kowt and used as a macabre celebratory drinking vessel at the SAS troops’ unofficial bar, the Fat Ladies Arms. The court has been shown photographs of soldiers drinking from the leg. Person 24 said he “didn’t have a problem” with people drinking from the war trophy prosthetic leg – “it’s black humour” – and admitted he had drunk from it. Roberts-Smith was not pictured drinking from the leg and he denied having done so in evidence last year. Roberts-Smith does not dispute he shot and killed the man with the prosthetic leg but says the man was legitimately engaged in battle. He was extensively questioned about the Whiskey 108 mission when he gave evidence in this trial last year. Roberts-Smith told the court he killed the man because he was a threat to Australian troops. Roberts-Smith said he saw the man carrying a weapon and running, and killed him in accordance with troops’ rules of engagement. “He had his hand over the top of the weapon, because he was carrying it down next to his body like that … hunched over, as in, running like that with his shoulders down.” Person 24 is the third soldier to give similar – though not identical – evidence that they saw an Australian soldier shoot an Afghan man at Whiskey 108, with two saying they believed it to be Roberts-Smith. Other soldiers have given evidence they saw a man with a prosthetic leg who was discovered hiding in a secret tunnel inside the compound and taken into custody of Australian troops before being “marched off” by Roberts-Smith. A soldier anonymised before the court as Person 41 previously told the court he was also standing guard outside the compound when he saw Roberts-Smith “frog-marching” an Afghan man “by the scruff of his neck”. “He [Roberts-Smith] had his machine gun in his right arm … he then proceeded to throw the Afghan male down on to the ground. The Afghan male landed on his back. [Roberts-Smith] then reached down and grabbed him by the shoulder and flipped him on to his stomach. Then I observed him lower his machine gun and shoot approximately three to five rounds into the back of the Afghan male. “After he’d done that, he looked up and saw me standing there, and looked at me and said ‘are we all cool, we good?’ “I just replied, ‘yeah mate, no worries’.” Under cross-examination, Person 41 denied lying about the incident but conceded he hadn’t reported what he had allegedly seen to his commanders. “I just wanted to keep quiet about the whole thing,” he told the court. “I was a new trooper, on my very first trip with the SAS, I just wanted to toe the line. It’s the unwritten rule – you go along with whatever happens.” Another soldier, Person 14, who was standing next to Person 24, previously told the court the light was fading when he heard heavy footsteps to his right. “As I turned my head to my right, there were three Australian soldiers and a black object, which was similar to a human, that was thrown to the ground.” Person 14 said the person made a thudding, “expulsion of air” noise as they hit the ground. “Then a soldier raised their Minimi F89 Para and fired an extended burst. It was loud, like a ‘BRRRRRT’ for one second. “That person turned and walked away out of sight back into Whiskey 108.” Person 14 said he said to another soldier: “What the hell what that?” He said he did not recognise the soldier who fired at the time. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Person 14 said the soldier who shot the man was wearing a distinctive new camouflage paint, worn by only one SAS patrol in action that day, the five-man team of which Roberts-Smith was a member. Person 14 told the court that, at the conclusion of the mission, he saw Roberts-Smith carrying the distinctive Minimi weapon at the troops’ lay-up point. “I saw who had the Para Minimi [machine gun],” he said. “It was Ben Roberts-Smith.” Under cross-examination, Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith accused Person 24 of giving false evidence. “I wouldn’t, in a court of law, give that evidence if it was false; I’ve just sworn an oath, Mr Moses,” Person 24 replied. “You are here to tell a story?” “I am here to tell the truth, Mr Moses, and you are getting the truth.” Person 24 was medically discharged from the SAS. He said prior to leaving the military, the mission at Whiskey 108 was the subject of “much talk” within the regiment. “But it has always been veiled, very veiled,” he said. “It’s something people didn’t want to talk about,” he said. Moses raised the question of whether Person 14 may have perjured himself last month when he told the court he had only spoken with his wife and his lawyer over a weekend when he was in the middle of giving evidence. Person 24 told the court on Monday he phoned Person 14 after Person 14’s first day in the witness box “to see how he was going”, though said they didn’t discuss his evidence. Person 14 reportedly said it was “tough” and that Moses “went at him like a rabid dog” during cross-examination. Person 24 remains in the witness box.

3/14/2022,"Australia and the Netherlands have launched legal proceedings against Russia through the International Civil Aviation Organization for the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The legal action could compel Russia to take part in stalled negotiations with the two countries, and could also result in it being penalised by the United Nations-linked organisation which is responsible for the administration of international aviation law. Australia and the Netherlands have been seeking compensation and an apology from the Russian federation for the MH17 disaster that saw 298 people, including 38 Australians, killed when it was shot down over Ukraine in 2014. However, Russia, which has denied involvement despite the findings of an international investigation, unilaterally withdrew from negotiations with the two countries in October 2020. Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, and attorney general, Michaelia Cash, announced on Monday that Australia would be launching joint action with the Netherlands under Article 84 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, and will allege that Russia is in breach of the Chicago Convention that underpins aviation law. “We have maintained since May 2018 that the Russian Federation is responsible under international law for the downing of Flight MH17,” Payne said in a statement ahead of Monday evening’s announcement in Sydney. “Today’s joint action by Australia and the Netherlands is a major step forward in both countries’ fight for truth, justice and accountability for this horrific act of violence.” “The Russian Federation’s refusal to take responsibility for its role in the downing of Flight MH17 is unacceptable and the Australian Government has always said that it will not exclude any legal options in our pursuit of justice.” Australia and the Netherlands will rely on what it says is the “overwhelming evidence” that the flight was shot down by a Russian Buk-TELAR surface-to-air missile system, which was transported from Russia to an agricultural field in the east of Ukraine on the morning of 17 July 2014. At the time the area was under the control of Russian-backed separatists. The two countries will also present evidence that the missile system belonged to the Russian Federation’s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Military Brigade, and was accompanied by a trained Russian military crew. Only the trained Russian crew of the Buk-TELAR, or someone acting under their instruction, direction or control could have launched the missile system, which was returned to the Russian Federation shortly after the downing of Flight MH17. The legal action is in addition to the Dutch national prosecution of four suspects for their individual criminal responsibility in the downing of the flight: three Russians, Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinskiy, Oleg Pulatov, and a Ukrainian, Leonid Kharchenko. An international investigation found that the men did not “push the button” on the missile system themselves, but had brought the anti-aircraft system to eastern Ukraine and were the link between the Moscow-backed separatist Donetsk People’s Republic and Russia. In the statement, Payne said the Russian federation needed to be held to account for its breaches of international law, particularly in light of the invasion of Ukraine. “Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine and the escalation of its aggression underscores the need to continue our enduring efforts to hold Russia to account for its blatant violation of international law and the UN Charter, including threats to Ukraine’s sovereignty and airspace,” Payne said. “While we cannot take away the grief of those whose loved ones died as a result of Russia’s actions, the Australian Government will pursue every available avenue to ensure Russia is held to account so that this horrific act never happens again.” At a press conference in Sydney, Payne told reporters Australia could “consider” withdrawing the action if Russia is “prepared to return to [the] negotiating table … but we have seen no sign of good faith from Russia on that for some time”. Australia and the Netherlands informed the Russian Federation in 2018 that the two countries held Russia responsible under international law for its role in the bringing down of MH17, despite the Kremlin’s repeated denials. Australia’s then foreign minister, Julie Bishop, at the time called on Russia to “enter into negotiations to open up a dialogue about its conduct and to seek reparations” for the families affected.",News/World news,Australia and the Netherlands launch legal action against Russia over MH17 disaster ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/australia-and-the-netherlands-launch-legal-action-against-russia-over-mh17-disaster
