2/27/2022,"France the best team in the world? Maybe not yet, but they will move up to third in the rankings after this, the leading side in the north. And more importantly for the traditionalists, they remain on course for a grand slam The most competitive Six Nations this may be, but France fairly dismantled Scotland in their own lair, a place they have not enjoyed visiting of late. Scotland played with their usual blend of enterprise and menace in the first half, as invigorating a 40 minutes of rugby as this championship has seen, even in this vintage era. But the way they capitulated in the second half revealed the familiar fragility that continues to run through them, a loss of composure when it matters. For France, though, this was another big stride forward. France may or may not be set to supersede the All Blacks, but this was a performance that bore more than a few similarities with rugby’s paragons. No need for long periods of possession and pressure, when you can absorb, absorb, then play with deadly precision like this. Not that they needed to absorb much at the start. France burst the game open with two tries of the highest class in the first quarter of an hour. If people are starting to talk about this French team as the best in the world, the maestro at the heart of it is the main reason. Antoine Dupont is almost universally recognised as the player of the moment, anywhere on this benighted planet, and he reminded us why in the eighth minute. Finn Russell’s unconventional chip looked as if it were imaginative and into space, but it brought Dupont onto the ball. He brushed past Darcy Graham, then past Rory Darge, over Ali Price, and suddenly he was into Scotland’s 22, having been in his own only a few seconds earlier. That was brilliant enough, but France pushed home the advantage with consummate skill. Gael Fickou stepped in as scrum-half twice, Cyril Baille had a rumble, and Julien Marchand sent Paul Willemse crashing over. A fabulous score. Graham brilliant won the restart, to set up Russell for a successful penalty, but France were over again three minutes later. Melvyn Jaminet won a 50-22, and the handling of France’s midfield from the lineout was sublime, deft, swift and in the faces of Scotland’s defence. Damian Penaud made ground down the right and turned the ball inside, where Baille was brilliant, setting up Yoram Moefana with an inside ball. France looked settled, 12-3 up so early, but Scotland took over next. They needed to score more than they did, and they were an agonising set of fingertips away from a vital lead at the break. If Scotland have been tested this championship it is in the back row. Here was a brand new unit, after the loss of their first-choice combination. Darge started his first Test, after his debut from the bench the week before, and, after his rude introduction to Dupont, he settled quickly. He was a regular menace at the breakdown and picked a great line for Scotland’s try on the half-hour, after athletic contributions from his mates in the back row. That brought Scotland to within two points, when the match turned. A brilliant counterattack sparked by Duhan van der Merwe saw Stuart Hogg reaching out for a long pass by Chris Harris, a try the likely outcome for a man of his pace. Alas, he spilled the pass, and that crucial score before half-time went the other way instead. France won a penalty at the resultant scrum and then another at the line-out, successfully milking for the third time a penalty by holding Cameron Woki in the air longer than seemed necessary. Jonathan Danty sucked in Scotland’s defence from the second line-out, and France had all the space they needed. Fickou ended up exploiting it, running on an arc to the corner. What could have been a Scotland lead at the break had become in a couple of minutes 19-10 to the French. And that was not the end of it. As the latest team to have beaten the All Blacks, France peddled that knack the perennial best team in the world have made their own – scoring just before and/or after half-time. They had their bonus point less than two minutes into the second half, showing Scotland how to finish a counter. After another Scotland attack broke down, the referee criticising Price for milking a penalty, when Scotland thought he was awarding them one, Penaud was off down the right, chipping ahead. The ball landed in the arms of Danty, who found a clear run to the line – 26-10. That was that. Scotland chasing a game, for all their natural flair and ambition, too often descends into Scottish incoherence. Scotland came and came again, and France picked them off with ease, particularly at the breakdown, where penalty followed penalty. And tries. Another counterattack on the hour, another try, Darge dispossessed in the tackle, the ball shipped to Penaud for number five. A sixth followed, by Penaud again, from Romain Ntamack’s cross-kick from a line-out, the Scottish defence now completely at sea. The home team did finish with a fine counterattack of their own, Van der Merwe, scoring a try, but it mattered not. The match had long ago escaped them, even if it had seemed tantalisingly within their grasp just before the break. Blink, and the French are gone.

2/27/2022,"Among the many gleaming white boats lining Barcelona’s historic port, the super yachts of the super-rich stand out. If there are fewer of them than usual at the moment it’s because most are still wintering in the Caribbean. However, overshadowing the small fry (super yachts are roughly defined as starting from 25 metres in length) are a number of palatial vessels, including yachts owned by the King of Bahrain, Walmart heiress Nancy Walton Laurie, and media mogul Barry Diller. Among them are three vessels belonging to some of Russia’s wealthiest men. They have a combined value of hundreds of millions of dollars. Their owners could be forgiven for feeling a little nervous as western governments ponder who to target next in a threatened barrage of sanctions against Russia in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine. All three yachts are in for refitting in the MB92 shipyard, which specialises in servicing super yachts. The largest is the 139-metre, Bermudan-flagged Solaris, which belongs to Roman Abramovich, the man who owns 29% of mining company Evraz, as well as Chelsea football club. Next up is the 74-metre Aurora, owned by Andrey Molchanov, who has a controlling stake in LSR Group, Russia’s biggest producer of building materials, and a current net worth of €1bn, according to Forbes magazine. Finally, there is the 70-metre Galactica Super Nova, whose owner is Vagit Alekperov, president and chief executive of Lukoil, in which he has around a 20% stake. He also owns 36.8% of the football club Spartak Moscow. Lukoil is considered to be a potential target for European sanctions, given the energy giant’s importance to the Russian economy, and the fact that it is already subject to some US sanctions. It is a company of strategic importance to Russia, and Alekperov was among a gathering of business leaders summoned by Putin to a meeting in the Kremlin on Thursday. Since 2017, Alekperov has also been part-owner of Marina Port Vell, Barcelona’s pleasure port. The old port, which dates back to Roman times, was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, and in 2010 it was ceded by the conservative city government to the London-based Salamanca Group for development as a marina for super yachts. In 2017, ownership passed to the Qatari Investment bank, QInvest, and a fund with several international investors, among whom Alekperov is a major stakeholder, in a concession that expires in 2048. The port is investing €20m (£16m) in a bid to become the biggest super yacht marina in the Mediterranean. Abramovich is one of 35 individuals who should be considered for sanctions, according to a list drawn up by the organisation of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The names of the 35, who range from businessmen to media owners, government officials and politicians, was read out in parliament this week last week by Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran. She said: “We need to start by heeding the names of those who were identified by Alexei Navalny and his team as ‘key enablers’ more than a year ago.” Abramovich holds Israeli and Portuguese citizenship and his lawyers insist that “he is not subject to sanctions, and this has been confirmed publicly by the prime minister”. They have said neither he nor Evraz “fit the description of those likely to be subject to sanctions, as set out by the foreign secretary”. Alekperov and Molchanov did not respond to requests for comment. The three businessmen have not been named on any sanctions list. However, both US president Joe Biden and Boris Johnson have threatened wider action against the owners of companies across sectors including energy, mining and construction, which puts individuals such as Alekperov within the scope of those who could be affected. “The UK’s new designation criteria permit a broad range of businesses to be designated as financial sanctions targets,” says sanctions expert Stacy Keen at law firm Pinsent Masons. “In relation to Russia’s strategically important businesses, the regulations specify that this applies to those operating in the chemicals, construction, defence, electronics, energy, extractives, financial services, transport and information, communications and digital technologies sectors.” So, were such sanctions applied, what would it mean for the oligarchs’ yachts in Barcelona and elsewhere? “The way sanctions work is that they don’t seize assets, but freeze them, and the individuals can’t use them to generate funds,” says Keen. “If the EU were to make a designation equivalent to that made by the UK, no Spanish or other EU business would be allowed to supply services, from fuel to crew, for the use of the yacht. In effect, the yacht wouldn’t be able to function.” How this will play out depends on the alignment of sanctions between the main players – the US, the UK and the EU. All three have promised coordinated action, and while there are some differences in measures taken in recent days, there are areas of overlap. However, this is unlikely to have any knock-on effect on the thriving wider super yacht market, where order books are full for at least five years. According to MB92, 185 super yachts were built in 2021, compared with 148 in 2019. Covid led to a boom in the deluxe vessels, which provide an ideal form of social distancing for the 1%. Record numbers of the vessels were moored off the coasts of Italy and Greece in 2021. The long waiting lists have also boosted the secondhand super yacht market as well, with some vessels selling for more than their original cost. The business is getting bigger and so are the boats, as billionaires vie to outdo each other with their floating palaces. Solaris, which cost $600m, was built last year, and can reportedly accommodate 36 guests in its 18 luxurious cabins as well as 60 crew members. There is a gym, swimming pool, sauna, beauty salon and a jacuzzi. It is said to come with state-of-the-art security including a radar-controlled missile detection system, bulletproof windows and armoured protection. The yacht was spotted sailing up the Catalan coast on Wednesday, possibly on sea trials after its refit in Barcelona, before returning to its moorings. These yachts are not only hugely expensive to build, they cost a fortune to maintain and crew. On average, owners must spend 10% of the purchase price annually to keep one afloat, which means Solaris has running costs of around $60m a year. Solaris is just one of Abramovich’s four yachts. The 170-metre Eclipse, currently moored in the Caribbean, is the second largest in the world, after the 180-metre Azzam owned by Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the UAE. The Eclipse was in the Barcelona shipyard for a refit at the end of last year. Txema Rubio, MB92’s commercial director, says the yard can work on up to 25 yachts at a time. The average refit costs around €900,000, although in some cases this may rise to as much as €20m. Despite their vast size, some super yachts travel with a “shadow boat” that carries accessories – such as speedboats, jet skis, cars, helicopters and even submarines – which the owners don’t want cluttering up their showcase yacht.Refits take a minimum of three months, sometimes much longer, during which time the yard may need to accommodate hundreds of crew members. Part of the popularity of Barcelona as a marina and a super yacht shipyard is that crew get to spend months in one of the world’s most attractive cities while the vessels are moored or in dry dock.

2/27/2022,"Pandemics, as the historian Yuval Noah Harari observed at the beginning of the current one, tend to accelerate history. If you doubt that then think back to, say, January 2020. If you told people then that by April that year major corporations would be insisting that most of their staff worked from home, they would have given you funny looks and checked for the nearest exit. Nobody then had heard of Zoom and something called “video conferencing” was considered either a geeky affectation or the last resort of organisations that could not afford air fares for senior executives to go to Rotterdam or Las Vegas for a one-hour meeting. And then, in the blink of an eye, working from home had become not just an acronym – WFH – but a cliche and Zoom, like Google before it, had become a verb as well as a noun. The tiresome daily commute shrank to padding from bedroom to kitchen to a laptop on a desk. For an initial period, utopian visions of better work-life balances blossomed. But then the new reality dawned: instead of us going to the office, the office had come to us and we were working, eating and sleeping in it. Still, we had a bit more autonomy WFH than we had in the office under the beady-eyed surveillance of managers. Or so we thought. But capitalism – and its servant, technology – never sleeps. Those managers, who had always regarded WFH as some kind of work-avoidance scam, realised that digital technology was just the ticket for keeping an eye on their newly remote subordinates. It would make sure that they weren’t idly browsing Pinterest, or bidding on eBay, or doing private emails, or a thousand other unproductive things, on the company’s dime. And so a swarm of tech companies evolved to service those paranoid suspicions. Thus was born the new industry of little tech. Coworker.org is an admirable American non-profit organisation that builds digital tools and communities for employees to share information, form collectives and advocate for change. It also campaigns to prevent employers from dismantling hard-won employment rights through increasingly sophisticated surveillance, data-mining and the fragmentation of the workplace. And it has recently published a sizable database of companies that make “bossware” – software for enabling employers to keep a close eye on staff who are working from home. The first thing that strikes one browsing through the database entries is that employers seeking intrusive surveillance of their homeworkers have a wide number of tools to choose from, ranging from software for general oversight (sometimes benign, as in detecting inappropriate or inadvertent attempts to share confidential files) to monitoring of a really creepy kind. One company (chosen at random) describes itself as purveyor of “a robust, state-of-the-art technology that makes employee tracking simple and effective”. Its keystroke and activity tracking feature helps “keep track of keystroke and mouse-click activity of remote employees” and can “detect and send alerts about suspicious keyloggers, false keystrokes and prohibited data-copy attempts to the management”. And so on. Another, billed as Your Favorite Small Business Employee Monitoring Tool asks if “you know how much time your employees spend working. Personal use of employers’ computers is widespread beyond imaginable. Track their computer activities and learn whose performance is exemplary and who is abusing their workplace.” Most of these blurbs for broad privacy intrusions come coated with three coats of prime corporate cant about “ethics” and “consent”, which should raise a hollow laugh from employees who will see them – accurately – as amounting to this: accept this or look for work elsewhere. Coworker.org has also released a 73-page report, Little Tech Is Coming for the Workers, which makes interesting reading. Among other things, it reveals that little tech isn’t so little: the database includes 550 companies. They include some giants that have worker-surveillance products in their portfolios, but a lot of smaller outfits that most of us have never heard of. The report says that “venture capital, private equity and hedge funds are channelling record-breaking investments into the expansion of this unregulated marketplace whose products erode labour standards for workers and exploit weak labour protections”. For these investors, the lack of regulation is a feature, not a bug. As is the fact that the technology is a force for, as the report puts it, “depersonalisation and dehumanisation”. This industry revealed by Coworker.org’s research may be little tech, but in key respects it’s just aping its bigger brother. Reading through the blurbs puffing its products, one comes away with the same feeling one gets from inspecting the algorithmic tools of the tech giants. In both cases, software written by a small elite is designed to monitor, classify and exploit “ordinary” people in ways that the programmers and their corporate masters would never themselves tolerate. And in that sense it’s just another example of how power corrupts those who possess it.

2/27/2022,"One of Boris Johnson flagship “green” pledges – to provide 4,000 new zero-emission, British-built buses by the end of 2024 – has been cast into serious doubt by UK manufacturers who say they have yet to receive any orders for new vehicles. MPs and campaigners are pressuring ministers for information on when money will be committed to allow the manufacture of the zero-emission buses, which the prime minister promised would form part of a green transport revolution in his first term in Downing Street. He made the pledge in February 2020, just before the Covid pandemic, when he was keen to promote his environmental credentials and show how green policies could benefit people’s lives whileboosting British businesses. Since then, only a fraction of the necessary funds has been allocated, with £320m being committed by chancellor Rishi Sunak in last autumn’s spending review, towards an estimated total of £4bn needed to put 4,000 green buses on the road. UK manufacturers say that unless the funds are committed and orders made soon, there will not be time to get the new vehicles into service in time to meet Johnson’s promise. Paul Davies, managing director of bus manufacturer Alexander Dennis, which is Britain’s biggest bus builder and the world’s largest manufacturer of double-decker buses, said: “The problem is that we are running out of time to deliver on what was promised. If everything is left until the last minute, the danger is we have to look to overseas companies for quicker and cheaper options when the intention was that they would be British-made.” Buta Atwal, chief executive of another major bus manufacturer, Wrightbus, said he had been encouraged by Johnson’s announcement two years ago but had been left disappointed not to have heard any positive news about orders since. “We invested heavily in zero-emission technology on the basis of the government’s plans. so we are looking forward to the first order.” Paul Tuohy, chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport, said: “It’s clear from our work with bus operators, local authorities, utility companies and others involved in providing bus services that we are not currently on target to deliver nearly enough zero-emission buses anywhere near fast enough. “Government must step in to offer more support to the industry in the long term and do more to boost passenger numbers in the short term to give operators the confidence to invest.” Shadow buses minister Sam Tarry MP said ministers had misled parliament about the programme. “British manufacturers tell me they haven’t received a single order. We’re now more than two years on from when the prime minister promised there’d be 4,000 zero-emission buses on our roads by 2025. “They’re clearly well off target and this is yet another sign that they’re not serious about their commitment to decarbonise our economy and meet our net zero target by 2050, and they’re not serious about supporting British manufacturing and jobs.” The Campaign for Better Transport said that of the 38,000 buses nationally, currently only 12% are hybrid and 2% are zero-emission (4% in London and 1% in the rest of England). In the recent levelling up white paper, ministers said that “over £500m is being spent this parliament on delivering zero-emission buses.” Labour says this shows that the government is already backing away from its previous commitments, as this would only allow a tiny proportion of the promised number to be manufactured. Last year, announcing his bus strategy, Johnson said: “I love buses and I have never quite understood why so few governments before mine have felt the same way,” adding that “better buses will be one of our major acts of levelling up”. A DfT spokesperson said: “The government remains committed to supporting the introduction of 4,000 zero-emission buses and achieving an all zero-emission bus fleet. This will support our climate ambitions, improve transport for local communities and support high quality green jobs.”",News/UK news,"Boris Johnson’s promise to build 4,000 zero-emission buses makes zero progress",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/26/boris-johnson-promise-build-4000-zero-emission-buses-green-transport-revolution
2/27/2022,"In the totally subjective world of chic interiors, a new post-pandemic trend is happening and it is all about colour. It doesn’t take a lot of head-scratching to see why. After a prolonged period of minimalism and neutrals that gratefully instilled a sense of calm in a world of back-to-back everything, in the post-immediate pandemic era it seems we’re after a bit of Ab Fab-inspired colour again. “There has definitely been an explosion of colours in many UK homes,” says Dr Geraldine Tan, who started her blog, Little Big Bell, celebrating colourful interior design 12 years ago alongside her job as an NHS doctor. She has since grown a following of 277k on Instagram. “I remember when Scandinavian style with the monochrome black and white was on trend, I thought I’d give it a go, but no matter how much I tried, colour always crept in,” she says. “It makes me and my family feel happy, calm and optimistic. I love being at home after a stressful day working at the hospital.” Embracing colour in all aspects of life actually falls perfectly in line with the mood right now as people “want to feel happier, a form of escapism from the pandemic,” says Tan. On the whole, we’re looking for surprise and spontaneity. It’s happened with our clothes, and our homes are the next extension – especially after we’ve spent so long in them. JJ Martin, the Milan-based founder of fashion’s most colourful contemporary fashion brand La DoubleJ, delights in sharing that: “There is not one white wall in my house!” She brings the same explosion of shades to her homewares as she does her clothes. “I think a lot of people don’t realise that we are energy-beings and colours have energy frequencies – we literally get an effect from being around colours,” she says. “Look at nature! It’s why we love rainbows, the blue sky and green grass. When I get creative, it always manifests in a colourful form – you don’t get a lot of optimism from all black.” Colours, agrees Tan, “can evoke all sorts of emotions and so picking them correctly for your home is important for the way you want to feel or be perceived”. So how to get started? Tan advises us to “start small and then expand, perhaps use pops of colours at first – for example some cushions and art prints.” Martin advises looking to the dinner table. “Covering your entire couch in a colourful print is a little bit more permanent – the tabletop you can mix up every day.” See her juicy-hued set of homewares (right) and the popular @Casa_a_blanca Instagram account for inspiration. “This is not something you should do because it’s a trend; you should do something that resonates with you,” she adds. “Just try it – and play with it.” As a side-line project of Blanca Miró Scrimieri, co-founder of avant-garde retailer Vasquiat, this account oozes cool.

2/27/2022,"In confrontations with Vladimir Putin, the west fights with one hand tied behind its back. It does so by choice, out of timidity, greed and sloth. This has been the case for more than two decades. This is now the case in Ukraine. And this is why we lose. When Russia’s mafioso-president murdered Alexander Litvinenko, invaded Georgia, abetted Syrian war crimes, annexed Crimea, sent mercenary killers to Libya and the Sahel, subverted America’s elections, waged cyber warfare, weaponised the internet and poisoned the Skripals, ensuing punishments were short-lived, ineffective or non-existent. Western politicians and businesses have known for years what kind of man Putin is. They knew what his rogue regime was capable of. Yet many pretended otherwise, or looked away, or took his money, as have far-right parties in France and Italy. They pretended he was normal. This pattern was repeated prior to the Ukraine invasion. Even as they deplored what they called the biggest security threat to Europe since 1945, western leaders failed to act with urgency on their own warnings. They pulled their punches. Now it’s too late. And this is why we lose. Ever since the Ukraine crisis blew up, the west has been on the defensive. It’s time to switch to “offense”, as American footballers say. If, for example, Putin has indeed grown “paranoid” and “irrational” – terms used last week by US and European officials to suggest he’s off his trolley – then, logically, there’s only one course of action. Having failed to prevent the invasion, the allies must seek regime change in Moscow. Putin must be toppled from his throne. Only decapitation can save Ukraine, the global order – and Russia itself. The west should publicly assist all those Russians who want new leadership in their country. Feed Putin’s paranoia. Erode his base. Make him fear his friends. Why are Joe Biden and Boris Johnson not demanding the release of Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most able opposition activist – the man Putin tried to kill with a nerve agent in 2020 and then imprisoned? Why not call for new, free elections? Western leaders should tell patriotic Russians everywhere: take a leaf out of Ukraine’s 2014 revolutionary playbook, defy Putin’s police state (as during Moscow’s 2011 pro-democracy protests), and purge this Soviet era throwback. Will they do so? Unlikely. The same leaders who warn of unprecedented threats from an unhinged tsar appear fearful of provoking him. They worry about losing control, about unpredictable outcomes. The one thing that might prevent a prolonged war and avoid future collisions – helping Russians dump Putin – is the very thing they dare not do. And this is why we lose. Why was a pre-invasion offer of full Nato membership for Kyiv – if Putin failed to pull back – never discussed, let alone made? Ukraine joining Nato is supposedly what Ivan the Terrible #2 fears most. It might have created some leverage. Which genius in Washington decided to assure Putin that Nato forces would not fight for Ukraine if he attacked? It must have seemed like a green light. A little ambiguity about the allied response would not have hurt. Tobias Ellwood, Tory MP and former soldier, argued weeks ago that a limited number of Nato troops should be sent to Ukraine, to act as a tripwire for a Russian advance. Now calls for Nato air cover over Ukraine are similarly dismissed. Johnson, aping Churchill, spoke bullishly when visiting Kyiv about solidarity and deterring aggression. But actually doing something brave like deploying British troops there, and taking a risk, was a bridge too far for him. Poland and Lithuania, keenly aware of Putin’s inability to respect other people’s boundaries, proposed last week that Ukraine be fast-tracked into the EU. This offer should still be made. Meanwhile, recall Europe’s (and UK and US) ambassadors from Moscow, break off diplomatic relations, and declare a full-spectrum trade and banking embargo, including Russia’s vital oil and gas exports. Why has this not been done already? Putin is far beyond the pale. It is unlikely to happen. Because of all that dirty Russian money. Because Europe’s energy prices would rocket. Because investors and exporters would raise a stink. Because western politicians still pretend he’s “rational”. Because far-right fellow travellers, such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, protect their pal. And this is why we lose. Could more have been done, sooner, to stop Putin? Certainly. Yet it also now appears he decided to invade days or weeks ago, no matter what anyone might say. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, says he was personally “deceived”. Maybe there was just no stopping him. How to turn this around, even now? As in the Michael Caine film Get Carter, the order of the day must be: “Get Putin.” Forget the oligarchs. Aim punitive sanctions directly at him personally, at his money, and at elite politicians, officials and propagandists who sustain him. Arraign him for war crimes at the International Criminal Court. Issue national arrest warrants, using universal jurisdiction. Tell his fellow dictator, China’s Xi Jinping, to steer clear or risk collateral damage. Make a wanted poster of Putin’s mug. Cast him as a pariah, an international outlaw. Help the Ukrainian military fight him off by supplying weapons and aid. And then help Russian democrats bring him down as his military offensive falters and bodybags start to come home. There is no earthly reason why this twisted little coward should be allowed to go on causing global mayhem and misery. His fall would be a boon to the world. And yet, on past form, it probably won’t happen soon. He will survive, even as uncounted thousands perish. Why? Because we let him. The west is complicit in Putin’s tyranny. It always has been. And this is why we lose.",Opinion/Opinion,"Timidity, greed and sloth: why the west always loses to Putin",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/26/timidity-greed-and-sloth-why-the-west-always-loses-to-putin
