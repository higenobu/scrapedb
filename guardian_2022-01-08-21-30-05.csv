1/8/2022,"If you’re going to make a statement, you might as well make it emphatic. That has been the attitude reflected in Usman Khawaja’s feats in Sydney at the fourth Ashes Test as he followed his first-innings 137 with an unbeaten 101. He joined the very rare club to have made twin centuries in a Test, alongside 16 other Australians, and in scoring his 10th Test ton he levelled up with Lindsay Hassett, Bob Simpson and Simon Katich. The first century was the work of an opener, even if in this match he was required to bat at No 5. Khawaja left the ball with dedication, waited out good spells, and was restrained in his shot selection before gradually expanding it. He faced 260 balls at a strike rate of just over 50. His only close call was a fast edge from the left-arm spinner Jack Leach that hit the wicketkeeper’s leg and bounced clear rather than being dropped.  His second hundred was the work of Khawaja circa 2016, when he made 104 not out in the semi-final and 70 in the final of the Big Bash to carry the Sydney Thunder to the title on his own blade. In the second innings in Sydney he settled himself in with 35 off 74 balls before tea before launching 66 off 64 balls after it. He played the reverse sweep to crisp perfection, deflected lap shots over his shoulder, and launched slog-sweeps off the spinners into the stands. There was little pressure, coming in 190 runs ahead against a team whose batting has struggled, but he drove Australia’s advantage all the way home. In doing so, Khawaja has set up a very interesting selection quandary for those running his team. Four days ago he was supposed to be a one-match gap-filler while Travis Head sat out the required time after a positive Covid test. Even scoring a hundred in the first innings did not mean that was going to change. But scoring two in two makes it far harder to leave out Khawaja for Australia’s forthcoming outing in Hobart. There will probably be a nationwide strike if selectors go that way. That said, leaving out Head would be harsh as well. He made 152 in the Brisbane Test to set up Australia’s first match of the series, setting them on a path to an Ashes win in straight sets. At 28 years old, Head has been heavily invested in as Australia’s future. Having just turned 35, Khawaja is something else. But age should not exclude him. Chris Rogers had a profitable Test career from that age onwards, Adam Voges much the same. Khawaja, enjoying a mastery of his game, could still have several years to offer. Retaining Khawaja need not necessarily be a straight shootout with Head. The two centuries in Sydney constitute the entirety of Khawaja’s career batting at No 5. He is a career first drop or opener, whether internationally or domestically. It is illustrative of England’s series that by the end of day four, the visiting openers had made 187 runs for 14 dismissals, while Khawaja had made 238 for one. It is also illustrative to put Khawaja’s tally from two innings against Marcus Harris with 179 from seven. Harris doesn’t deserve to be punted in his own right – his 76 in Melbourne was an important innings, and he has looked better since. But he is strongly inclined to loose dismissals for middling scores, of which his nick behind from Leach for 27 to end his match in Sydney was just the latest. If the question is purely who is the better player between he and Khawaja, there are no grounds for debate. And at 29 years old with 14 Tests behind him, Harris can’t keep being defined as a project player. None of which means that Khawaja is some batting god. He was dropped in England in 2019 after underwhelming returns from many opportunities across a decade. By then he had played in four Ashes series for a batting average of 29. He had played three great innings – Dubai against Pakistan, Adelaide against South Africa, and Wellington against New Zealand – but had a lot of uninspiring efforts in between. What he is right now, though, is a player in supreme form, full of confidence, evidently more relaxed in the middle than he has ever been, having built an understanding of his game from experience while retaining the physical capability of delivering it. That he found a method against spin in the UAE in 2018 means that he could be significant in the coming year with nine Tests in Asia ahead. It is possible that Khawaja won’t play in the fifth Ashes Test. Team management backed Harris before the series to go the distance. Head has claims to return. But under the chair of selectors, George Bailey, Australia have shown a more flexible approach to picking the right players for the right conditions. Khawaja may not be opening in Hobart, and he will probably take that in his stride. But when Australia take the field in Karachi in March, it is very hard to believe he won’t be among those running on.",Sport/Sport,Khawaja’s twin Ashes hundreds give Australia selection dilemma | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/08/khawajas-twin-ashes-hundreds-give-australia-selection-dilemma
1/8/2022,"Some people are art collectors. I’m not one of those. I’m not rich enough and, even if I were, I’m not interested in that kind of acquisition. I’m just someone who likes pictures a lot and who buys as many as I possibly can. Naturally, this depends – mostly – on my funds at any given moment. But not exclusively. When my passion first overcame me, after all, I was about as broke as it was possible for a salaried person to be. It was 1992, and I was trainee reporter in Glasgow, where I rented one small room, from whose single bed I could see everything I owned, which was mostly a load of letters from my bank informing me that I was overdrawn. I can’t remember whether the idea of travelling to Jura to write about Julie Brook, an artist who was living and working in a cave on the uninhabited side of the island, was my idea or my editor’s but, either way, I was mad keen to do the story, mostly because I knew that it was there that George Orwell wrote 1984. Of my interviewee’s work, I had rather less knowledge. Apparently, she liked to build stone structures on the beach in which she would then set a fire, the idea being that, as the tide came in, it would briefly look as though flames were rising from the sea itself.  I arrived by ferry. Julie had hiked to Craighouse to meet me and, in the bar of its hotel, we talked, and she showed me some photographs of her land art, which was indeed dramatic. Then she took me outside, where some huge oils were propped against a wall. This was when it happened. Standing in front of a painting of two salmon, my heart began to pound. “I would like to own this,” I heard a voice rather like my own say. “But I’ve got no money.” Julie must, I think, have felt my longing, which was extreme. She didn’t hesitate either. “Pay me in instalments,” she said. Which is what I did, for the next 18 months. It was all quite mad. Why was I buying this enormous canvas when I’d nowhere to hang it? More to the point, why was I spending money I didn’t have? But though I could hardly justify what I’d done, I didn’t regret it either. I was… relieved to have the painting in my possession, a sense of satisfaction that only grew as I transported it to Glasgow, and then, some weeks later, drove it to London in a hire car (I was moving again). When friends remarked on it, their disbelief (“you… bought this?”) induced in me only a crazed kind of pride. Better my salmon than any number of dresses from Top Shop. For a time, this was the only art I owned. But in my 30s, more flush at last, I started buying more. An abstract print by Victor Pasmore (he was less fashionable then, and his prices less loopy). A tiny oil of an old-fashioned newsagent, its window bedecked with tinsel, by no one you would ever have heard of. A portrait by John Aldridge, one of the (very much) less well-known artists associated with Great Bardfield in Essex. In each case, the feeling was the same. If a vaguely affordable picture speaks to me, the tips of my fingers seem to tingle and burn. I’m like Raffles, the gentleman thief, in the presence of a diamond tiara. It is still possible, if you’re clever, to get amazing things for the price of a couple of easyJet flights (I’m including the taxi to the airport). I have a drawing by Edward Burra that cost me less than £200; I bought it at Abbot & Holder in Museum Street in Bloomsbury, where I’ve had a lot of luck down the years (Tom, who runs it now, is very knowledgeable, but also very kind and non-intimidating). I haunt online auctions and sales – for the latter, I recommend Liss Llewellyn, which specialises in 20th-century British art – and I favour galleries outside London, such as Zillah Bell in Thirsk, Yorkshire, home to an archive of work by Norman Ackroyd, master of the aquatint. But my collection is not about big names. For me, value has nothing whatsoever to do with fame. There’s something thrilling about hanging a picture you scrimped and saved to buy next to one for which you paid £50 in a street market, and finding both equally beautiful; it’s like having a secret. I do own some pictures by fairly well-known artists (though I won’t name drop here). But one of my most beloved finds – a delicately gorgeous 1939 engraving by an artist whose name is illegible of Rachel’s Tomb in Hebron, in Israel/Palestine, where I lived as a child – I picked up for £40 at a Suffolk antique fair. Friends who were there will testify that I almost fainted with excitement as I handed over the cash. The judgmental cliche goes that either a person can spend money on stuff, or they can spend it on experiences. But a painting is both. Ben Nicholson thought people should hang a picture on the wall and “eat their meals with their back to it every day for a month”. Only then would they know how they felt about it; whether it was dead or alive. I think he was right. A painting will seem to change as you live with it. Like a person you’ve known for a long time, it will always be capable of surprising you. Perhaps you’ll move it to a new spot; perhaps the light will shift, falling on it in a new way; perhaps you’ll find yourself staring at it unexpectedly as you try to remember what you were going upstairs for. At any rate, you’ll see it anew, and suddenly interest and affection will rise inside you. Before you know it, you’ll be back in the first flush of love, delighted by the absolute rightness of your own taste; by what your eyes and heart once whispered to you, and are now telling you insistently all over again.

1/8/2022,"Justin and Dan Hawkins are the Lowestoft brothers behind rock band the Darkness. Puncturing the genteel Dido and Keane-era mainstream of the early noughties with their stadium rock and low-cut catsuits, their music had a short-lived period of ridicule before their debut album Permission to Land went on to sell 3.5m copies. At the peak of their commercial powers they won three Brit awards, an Ivor Novello, and penned the modern Christmas classic, 2003’s Christmas Time (Don’t Let the Bells End). The band split in 2006 after the release of their second album, but they’ve since reformed and released five more records. They are currently on tour.  Based on this image, I wonder if my parents looked at our physiques and temperaments and decided to try and equip us for what they thought would be our career paths. They saw me as the office junior and Dan as the sports hero. Or perhaps I’m dressed so smartly because somebody had died. Although I look a bit too cheerful and my tie is a bit too wide to be respectful. Growing up, me and Dan were never bored. We had a moped and we’d shoot guns and fire arrows. We really loved music, because our parents did. They were in the right place at a particularly exciting time in the 60s; mum’s got stories about Brian Jones and my dad’s got stories about Peter Sellers. They were always having parties. We’d hear the bass pumping through the walls: Mum was into reggae and the Stones, and Dad liked dad-rock. As a result, Dan and I were fanatic about old artists – industrial bands, hair rock, Aerosmith and Fleetwood Mac. From a really young age, around 12, we would be guns for hire in other people’s groups. Eventually, I joined one with Frankie [Poullain, the Darkness’ bassist] and Dan – but as a peripheral character in the dynamic. We had a really good singer but he didn’t know how to connect with an audience, so I ended up speaking to them instead, even though I was hidden at the back – I must have sounded like a disembodied voice booming from the side of the stage. In the end we sacked him; there was a pivotal moment when I did a special dance to Bohemian Rhapsody and Dan realised I’d be able to entertain folks. Unfortunately, I didn’t look like a frontman then. I’d been writing music for adverts in the 90s, for Ikea, Mars bar and Tango. But I never thought I’d be a rock star so I didn’t look after myself. I drank beer all the time and sat around being useless. When the Darkness properly formed, Dan was a driving force in terms of ambition whereas I was doing it in a defiant way: “What’s the point doing the same thing as everyone else? Let’s do something inspired by the music we loved growing up!” We’ve always been drawn to absurd masculinity. Plus I wanted to piss a few people off by not caring about the “cool” house of cards built during the 90s. Dan’s drive was a bit clearer: win an Ivor Novello. We both achieved our goals. But the latter was really significant. When we won the Ivor Novello songwriter of the year award, in 2004, we were surrounded by people we adored, and our parents were there. We spent the whole night looking at each other and going: “Yay!” At that point, everything I did was determined by drug addiction. It was really damaging; we would have achieved much more if I’d been able to keep it together. I can remember doing interviews and just about holding on to being conscious. I was white knuckling it and it affected all my relationships – the most important one being the one with my brother. When I went into recovery, I had to leave the whole infrastructure around the Darkness, the lifestyle and people – everything was a trigger. My heart would have exploded if I didn’t. My brother and I went through a two-year period of not really speaking. That was after I left the Darkness. The news didn’t go down well, which is fair enough. But blood is thicker than water; everyone knew we would be all right. We just needed a bit of time. These days, my relationship with Dan is fearsome. We’re the Hawkins brothers. People are terrified of us. And rightly so. You can see how different we are from the picture. We’ve been like that throughout our lives. It’s why we get along so well. Physically, we aren’t alike, and Justin is an extrovert while I have moments of being introverted – although on a big night out, you probably wouldn’t realise that. At school, Justin was two years above me. We got teased for having long hair, but Justin and his friends were also really hard. It was a weird situation where the geeks ruled. He protected me, but we didn’t get along a lot of the time. It was like a boiling pot. Between the ages of 14 and 16, I didn’t speak to my parents, apart from some grunting noises. Typical teenager, blasting music in his bedroom. Justin, however, got on famously with Mum and Dad. When he left home at 16, we became mates again. The pressure was gone, and I’d visit his little hovel in Lowestoft and make music. At one of our early Darkness gigs in London, it was the first time Justin wore a white catsuit with thunderbolts on the legs. He got changed into it in the toilet backstage. We all thought it looked amazing. Within three minutes of the first song he’d sweated straight through it. You could see everything. I had terrible stage fright at the start. Then one day we were playing in some small but pretty packed club and I looked up and saw that no one was looking at me. They were all looking at Justin. I realised, what am I worrying about? After that I could just crack on with playing the guitar. I was really thankful. When I was 31, I had testicular cancer, and I had to have one of my testicles removed. While I was recovering, I stayed away from my family, so I was going to get chemo on my own. Justin said: “I’ll go. I’ll take you.” I remember sitting there, in the hospital and wondering how many people realise that this bond is still there between us. People didn’t even know we were friends. It was a tender moment. Tender for weeks! When I got married in 2014, Justin was my best man. He organised the greatest stag I could ever have imagined in Switzerland. When it came to the big day, he made a speech. “You know, Dan’s had a tough time, he’s recovered from cancer,” he said, and the room went quiet. “I don’t know about you, but I often wondered what happened to the other testicle … Well, don’t worry, I found him! Say hello to Tezza!” Justin then brings out a homemade, Jim Henson-style puppet testicle with his own hair sprinkled on it and sings a duet of the Spice Girls’ 2 Become 1 with it. It was the best thing I’ve seen. Justin and I did have a moment when we needed to be apart. When the band split, it was similar to when Justin left home at 16. It got to boiling point – puff – then we came back stronger. Now we have proper life rules in place that will enable us to avoid reaching boiling point again. So get used to this pair of prats.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Justin and Dan Hawkins of the Darkness look back: ‘People are terrified of us.

1/8/2022,"Carolyn Andriano, who testified in the trial of sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell in New York last month, has claimed that Virginia Giuffre told her in 2001 that she slept with Prince Andrew. The claims, made in an interview with the Daily Mail, will ratchet up the pressure on the prince, as it is a contemporaneous report of his alleged sexual assault of the then 17-year-old Giuffre. He has vehemently denied the claims and his lawyers have been urging a US judge to dismiss Giuffre’s civil suit against him.  Andriano, then 14 and living in Florida, said she was texted by Giuffre (formerly Virginia Roberts, before her marriage) in 2001 from London, who claimed she had slept with the prince. “[Giuffre] said, ‘I got to sleep with him’,” Andriano told the Mail. The accusations come after Andriano, now 35, waived her legal right to anonymity to tell the full story of her grooming and sexual assault from aged 14 to 17 at convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s £13m mansion in Palm Beach, Florida. Andriano previously gave evidence anonymously at Maxwell’s trial, alongside two other women who opted for anonymity, and Annie Farmer, 42, who chose to testify publicly. At the trial, Andriano testified as “Carolyn” and said that it was Giuffre who introduced her as a 14-year-old to Maxwell and Epstein. In her Mail interview, Andriano recalled Giuffre texting her in 2001, saying: “You’ll never guess who I’m with…” Andriano replied: “Who?” Andriano told the Mail: “[Giuffre] said, ‘I’m in London with Jeffrey and Maxwell and Prince Andrew.’ “She said they were going to have dinner. I kind of didn’t believe her, but I had no reason not to. I thought it was far-fetched but, then again, she knew wealthy people and had been to fancy parties and stuff like that.” Andriano said she had asked Giuffre if she’d been to the palace. “And she said, ‘I got to sleep with him’. She didn’t seem upset about it. She thought it was pretty cool,’ Andriano recalled. Andriano told the Mail that Giuffre sent a picture of her with the prince by text. The Guardian was unable to immediately verify the claims independently. Representatives for the prince declined to comment, according to the Mail. Maxwell, 60, was found guilty of sex trafficking in her Manhattan federal court trial on Wednesday afternoon. She was arrested in July 2020, charged with involvement in ex-boyfriend Epstein’s sexual assault of teenage girls. The Mail said Andriano was not paid for her interview. She told the paper she was speaking out to let “all young women to know what happened to me when I was a teenager and how it has affected my life. This is my story and I want to tell it”. Andriano waived her right to anonymity for the Mail interview.",News/UK news,"Virginia Giuffre told me in 2001 she slept with Prince Andrew, witness says",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/08/virginia-giuffre-told-me-in-2001-she-slept-with-prince-andrew-witness-says
