4/2/2022,"Something strange is going on after dark in western Wisconsin, at least judging from a surveillance photo shared by police. The image shows someone in the town of Eau Claire with a cone for a head. He or she appears to be trying to open a car door — something that is likely tougher to do while wearing a cone. Eau Claire Police shared the photo March 30 on Facebook, with an admission that officers are stumped. The city is 90 miles east of Minneapolis. “Our public space cameras help us resolve a lot of incidents daily,” the Eau Claire police wrote in a Facebook post. “That being said, we sometimes capture odd occurrences.” The post didn’t include reports of a car theft or anyone being victimized by someone with a cone for a head. It was posted two days too early to qualify as an April Fool’s Day joke, so the 2,000 reactions and comments have taken the department at its word that this is a real thing. Explanations from commenters have included assertions the person is French, part of a gang or “a traffic wizard.” “Looks very familiar,” Debbie Baier said. “Makes me want to apply to video surveillance position. Do you have a popcorn machine?” Nick Nosker said. “Deep down inside we all feel this to some degree,” Raychel Berg wrote.

4/2/2022,"A Florida judge has rejected Gloria Williams’ request to cut her time in prison for kidnapping a baby from a Florida hospital, even though the girl, now 23, has advocated on her behalf. Williams accepted a plea deal in 2008 for taking Kamiyah Mobley from her mother at UF Health Jacksonville maternity ward in 1998. She asked a judge in December to allow her to serve half of her sentence on probation because of good behavior and personal development. Mobley told the judge she “wholeheartedly” supports Williams and she needs her “mother home.” Williams said she takes responsibility for her actions and has become a better person during the four years she’s spent in prison so far. “There are many things I have learned since coming to the Department of Corrections, but the overall lesson of my incarceration has been one of accountability,” she wrote in a letter to Duval County Circuit Judge Marianne Aho. “I know and understand now that there is a ripple effect, that the consequences of my actions are never mine to suffer alone.” While Aho ruled that Williams filed the motion too late, she maintained that even if it was on time, she “did not find a basis to undo the original sentencing judges’ decision.” Williams posed as a nurse and took Mobley away from her mother five hours after she was born. As for her state of mind at the time of the kidnapping, Williams previously told the court that she “had just suffered a devastating miscarriage and was exhibiting symptoms conducive to postpartum depression, as well as experiencing extreme mental and emotional disturbance. At the time she took the child, she was not in her right state of mind.” She renamed the girl Alexis Manigo and moved to South Carolina, where she raised Mobley until she was found in 2017. Mobley, who was 18 at the time, reportedly learned about her abduction a year and a half before Williams’ arrest but did not go to the authorities and tried to delay it. The now 23-year-old woman has stayed in contact with her kidnapper and still considers Williams her “mom.” Mobley told Aho she had a “well-rounded life” with Williams. “I would like to make it very clear that she is my mother,” Mobley wrote in the letter to the judge. “She raised me, and not only provided for my needs, but she loved me unconditionally.” “I understand none of this modifies the truth of the past, nor does it justify my mom’s actions in any way,” she continued. “However, at the end of the day, I love my mother and I wholeheartedly support her! I ask the court’s grace and mercy, as I need my mother home.” Williams told the judge she has completed character development and faith programs and wants to become a certified peer facilitator. She asked Aho to allow her to serve nine years in prison and the other nine on probation. In the meantime, Williams said she has kept her distance from Mobley out of respect for her biological family. Kamiyah Mobley’s attachment to her abductor has caused a strain in her relationship with her biological mother, Shanara Mobley, who once asked Kamiyah to choose between the two women. Recent social media posts show the pair has worked on repairing their relationship, according to First Coast News. “What I see happening is Kamiyah is bringing her biological family to South Carolina to introduce them and to spend time with my mother (her nana), her sisters, nieces and nephews,” Williams wrote in her motion. “Everyone is coming together to give Kamiyah the best of both worlds and to bring her life into fulfillment.”",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,‘She Is My Mother … She Raised Me’: Judge Rules Woman Who Abducted Newborn and Raised Her as Her Own Will Not Have Sentence Reduced Despite Desperate Plea from Victim,https://news.yahoo.com/she-mother-she-raised-judge-123000597.html
4/2/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - Suggestions by U.S. officials that President Vladimir Putin's advisers are afraid to tell him awkward truths about Russia's military campaign in Ukraine show how little they understand him or Russia's government, the Kremlin said on Thursday. White House and European officials said on Wednesday that they believed Putin had been misled by advisers who were too scared to tell him how poorly the conflict in Ukraine was going or how badly Western sanctions had hit Russia. ""To our regret - and, in fact, this probably even causes our concern - it turns out that neither the State Department nor the Pentagon has real information about what is happening in the Kremlin,"" Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters. Russia's advances have been halted on many fronts by stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces, and it has yet to take control of a major city, while thousands of soldiers and civilians have been killed. White House communications director Kate Bedingfield had told reporters that Russia had made a ""strategic error"" and that a lack of accurate reporting had led to ""persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership"". But Peskov was dismissive. ""They just don't understand what happens in the Kremlin, they don't understand President Putin, they don't understand the decision-making mechanism, and they don't understand the way we work,"" he said. ""This is not just a pity, but causes anxiety. Because such a complete misunderstanding - it leads to wrong decisions, to rash decisions that have very bad consequences.""

4/2/2022,"By Sergiy Karazy and Natalia Zinets IRPIN, Ukraine (Reuters) - A fuel depot was ablaze at one of Russia's main logistics hubs for its Ukraine war effort on Friday, after what Moscow described as a cross-border air raid by Ukrainian helicopters, the first of its kind in the five week war. Ukraine said it would neither confirm nor deny responsibility for the huge fire at the fuel depot in Belgorod, a Russian city near the border which has served as a logistics hub for Russian troops fighting in nearby eastern Ukraine. Security camera footage of the depot, from a location verified by Reuters, showed a flash of light from what appears to be a missile fired from low altitude in the sky, followed by an explosion on the ground. The regional governor said two Ukrainian helicopters had been involved in the raid. Inside Ukraine, Ukrainian forces were moving into territory abandoned by withdrawing Russian troops in the north as peace talks resumed on Friday. But in the southeast, which Russia now says is the focus of its operation, the Red Cross said it had been barred from bringing aid to the besieged city of Mariupol. A Russian threat to cut off gas supplies to Europe unless buyers paid with roubles by Friday was averted for now, with Moscow saying it would not halt supplies until new payments are due later in April. Hours after the reported attack on the oil depot, an eyewitness reached by telephone in Belgorod, who asked not to be identified, said aircraft were flying overhead and there were continuous explosions from the direction of the border. ""Something is happening. There are planes and constant explosions in the distance."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said authorities were doing everything possible to reorganise the fuel supply chain and avoid disruption of energy supplies in Belgorod. The incident did not create comfortable conditions for the peace talks, he said. Ukrainian defence ministry spokesperson Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said he would neither confirm nor deny a Ukrainian role. ""Ukraine is currently conducting a defensive operation against Russian aggression on the territory of Ukraine, and this does not mean that Ukraine is responsible for every catastrophe on Russia's territory,"" he said. COLLECTING THE DEAD After failing to capture a single major Ukrainian city in five weeks of war, Russia says it is pulling back from northern Ukraine and shifting its focus to the southeast. Russia has painted its draw-down in the north as a goodwill gesture for peace talks, but Ukraine and its allies say the Russian forces have been forced to regroup after taking heavy losses due to poor logistics and tough Ukrainian resistance. Regional governors in Kyiv and Chernihiv said Russians were pulling out of areas in both those provinces, some heading back across borders to Belarus and Russia. In Irpin, a commuter suburb northwest of Kyiv that had been one of the main battlegrounds for weeks, now firmly back in Ukrainian hands, volunteers and emergency workers carried the dead on stretchers out of the rubble. About a dozen bodies were zipped up in black plastic body bags, lined up on a street and loaded into vans. Lilia Ristich was sitting on a metal playground swing with her young son Artur. Most people had fled; they had stayed. ""We were afraid to leave because they were shooting all the time, from the very first day. It was horrible when our house was hit. It was horrible,"" she said. She listed off neighbours who had been killed - the man ""buried there, on the lawn""; the couple with their 12-year-old child, all burned alive. ""When our army came then I fully understood we had been liberated. It was happiness beyond imagination. I pray for all this to end and for them never to come back,"" she said. ""When you hold a child in your arms it is an everlasting fear."" Kyiv regional governor Oleksandr Pavlyuk said Russian forces had also withdrawn from Hostomel, another northwestern suburb which had seen intense fighting, but were still dug in at Bucha, between Hostomel and Irpin. Further north, Russian forces have withdrawn from the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, although Ukrainian officials said some Russians were still in the radioactive ""exclusion zone"" around it. Britain's Ministry of Defence said Ukrainian forces had recaptured several villages linking Kyiv with the besieged northern city of Chernihiv. But Kyiv's Mayor Vitaliy Kiltschko said it was not yet time for those who fled Kyiv to hurry home. ""Huge"" battles were still being fought to the north and east. ""The risk of dying is pretty high, and that's why my advice to anyone who wants to come back is: Please, take a little bit more time,"" he said. RED CROSS AID BLOCKED Friday's peace talks, by video link, picked up from a meeting in Turkey on Tuesday, where Ukraine offered to accept neutral status, with international guarantees for its security. ""We are preparing a response. There is some movement forward, above all in relation to the recognition of the impossibility of Ukraine"" joining NATO, Russia's Lavrov said on Friday. Putin sent troops on Feb. 24 for what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise Ukraine. Western countries call it an unprovoked war of aggression and say Putin's real aim was to topple Ukraine's government. Russia now says it has turned its focus to the Donbas, a southeastern area where it has backed separatists since 2014. Russia's biggest target in that area is Mariupol, where the United Nations believes thousands of civilians have died under a month-long siege, suffering relentless bombardment without access to food and water supplies, medicine or heat. The International Committee of the Red Cross said a convoy it had organised had been denied permission to bring aid into Mariupol. It did not say who had refused permission. Spokesperson Ewan Watson said the convoy of buses had set off for Mariupol on Friday without the aid supplies, in the hope of reaching the city to evacuate trapped civilians. Ukraine has blamed Russia for refusing to allow any aid to reach the city.
