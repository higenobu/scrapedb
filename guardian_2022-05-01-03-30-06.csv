5/1/2022,"Adog came bounding over as Oleh Bondarenko walked towards the garden containing the burned-out house where he had been beaten, tortured and left to die. “Hey, friend,” he shouted, stroking her head and explaining the affectionate greeting. “I talked to her a lot when I was here”. He lost several teeth to Russian assaults, his torso is covered with scars, and the damage to his spine may be permanent. But his sense of humour has somehow emerged unscathed from a days-long ordeal at the hands of Russian soldiers who served in Syria before bringing some of the horrors of that war to the once-bucolic countryside outside Kyiv. “My small house,” he said with an ironic smile, peering down into a concrete pipe sunk into the ground to serve as a water cistern. It is not deep enough to stand in when the manhole cover is on and not wide enough to sit down; it is just about large enough to hold a man hunched over in a kind of slouch. Bondarenko was kept here for two days in March, slowly losing all feeling in his arms and legs, and then all ability to move them. Russian forces had arrived in Motyzhyn, just south of the main highway that leads west out of Kyiv, five days into the war. In a small wood on its outskirts they hid a battery of Grad rocket launchers and other artillery, excavated dugouts for dozens of troops, then set up camp to torture and murder civilians in the compound beside their position. By the time Bondarenko was brought there – blindfolded on top of a truck after beatings, mock executions and other torture at his home and then an abandoned farm – the soldiers had set up a grim routine, which they worked through each day in a drunken bloodlust. “It was systematic,” he said. The grass next to the large porch of a storehouse was used for torture by officers who rested and ate under the canopy. The ruins of the bombed-out house was where executions took place, and in the nearby woods they dug shallow mass graves for victims. This nightmare was presided over by three men who had been shaped in a conflict notorious for abuses. Trapped in his underground chamber, Bondarenko heard them gloat about their transfer to Ukraine. “They said that, after Syria, it was like a fairytale for them here,” he said. “It is a wealthy village, and there was plenty for them to steal.” It has been clear since the invasion began that troops and officers fighting there included many who had been in Syria. But Bondarenko’s testimony now links some of the worst abuses of this war to men who were on the ground thousands of miles away, defending the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Prosecutors for the Kyiv region, who have had to turn abruptly from investigating small-town crime to documenting extensive atrocities, are investigating the village killing camp. Oleh Tkalenko, a senior prosecutor for the Kyiv region, told the Observer: “We are aware of these commanders. We are close to identifying them and their names will soon be released.” He also said authorities were aware that a number of Russian soldiers who came into the Kyiv region had previously operated in Syria. Bondarenko said intelligence services had already told him the first name of one of his main tormentors. In Motyzhyn, unlike in Syria, the soldiers could speak the same language as their victims, yet it made no difference. They used that connection simply to interrogate and torment without needing an interpreter. “This is Russkiy Mir – the Russian world,” said Bondarenko with bitter irony, as he surveyed the killing field in his village, referring to the concept Vladimir Putin has invoked to justify his invasion, which denies Ukraine’s nationhood and claims it as just a region of greater Russia. Bondarenko had been dragged into a local centre of operation for Moscow’s murderous war simply because of where he lived – one of the twists of bad luck that has put so many thousands of Ukrainian civilians into the path of abusive soldiers and their guns. The head of the territorial army for the village, perhaps wiser than he was brave, had fled with his family at the start of the invasion. But he owned a yard next to a rehabilitation centre for drug users where Bondarenko is a live-in manager. The Russians were jumpy and angry after a Ukrainian ambush took out a convoy of ammunition heading through the centre of the village. “The next day the Russians came round with two tanks, killed people and shot up cars and garages,” said Serhii Dovichenko, who works at the village shop, which was looted and burned. They also destroyed several homes by the site of the attack. On 23 March, convinced that the Ukrainian resistance was operating nearby, they burst into Bondarenko’s centre, shooting the walls, mirrors and windows. They beat him, carried out a mock execution and then tied him to a quad bike and forced him to run as it drove off, telling him that if he fell he would be shot. He managed to stay upright until they reached a nearby farmyard, where they beat him again and faked another execution. Then, because he could not tell them the location of an army unit he was not part of, they loaded him blindfolded on to a truck and took him to their camp. Soon after he arrived, Ukrainian forces started shelling, and his captors fled to the basement, leaving him tied up outside. “They told us, ‘let your own kill you’,” Bondarenko said, and a piece of shrapnel skimmed his stomach, causing bleeding and a scar. At the time he had no idea where he was, although the camp was barely two miles from his home. He realised what was going on there, however, when the soldiers told him they had just killed the much-loved head of the village council, together with her husband and son. Known to locals as Olga Petrivna, a name that mixed affection and deference, she had chosen to stay and coordinate aid and territorial defence when the Russians arrived. For that, her family all paid with their lives; a large billboard with a photo of them now marks the entrance to the villagefrom the motorway, with a message: “Eternal respect from the people of Motyzhyn.” They were subjected to the same sadistic ritual as most victims of the camp, locals said. They were badly beaten, their arms twisted and broken, then, as death approached, they were shot in the hands or knees to cause maximum pain, then shot again in the stomach before finally being killed by a bullet to the back of the head. Bondarenko said of one later murder he heard while underground: “I could hear them killing him for an hour and a half, and I prayed they would take him quicker.” There were perhaps 60 soldiers at the Motyzhyn site, scattered in dugouts with officers in a house across a small lake. Not all were Syria veterans: there were also regular recruits – so fresh from Russia they didn’t realise for two weeks they were in Ukraine – who had to cook for the commanders and carry water, and who were apparently horrified by what they saw. In a bid, perhaps, to salvage their own humanity, they rescued Bondarenko, 48 hours into his ordeal. While the torturers were drunk, the recruits dragged him out and carried him to a room used as a prison at the back of the house. They warned him to stay quiet and cover his face, because the commanders would assume he had joined others in the mass grave if they noticed he was missing at all, but if they found him they would certainly kill him. Two days later, the same recruits unlocked the door, said the Russians were leaving and warned the two men inside not to come out for two hours because of the risk from lingering snipers. “They asked me to pray for them,” Bondarenko said. “These guys didn’t want any of this; they were in shock themselves, and to this day I pray for them. They saved my life.” The men had also dug an individual deep grave to bury a woman killed by a sniper after her father – who had been held with Bondarenko simply because he had come to the base to ask for medical help – begged them not to throw her into the mass pit. The Russians burned the forest and fields to deprive Ukrainian forces of camouflage. Now spring is returning, green shoots are emerging through the charred ground and daffodils are in bloom just a few metres from the torture chamber. Not far from the graves, a book lies open beside a dugout. Tales and Fairy Tales looks as if it had been abandoned mid-chapter by a young soldier in a rush to leave, who hadn’t realised, or didn’t want to know, that metres away a real-life horror had unfolded, and that he had been part of it.

5/1/2022,"Boris Johnson has been rendered “incapable of governing” by a series of scandals and rows that have left him unable or unwilling to tackle the cost of living crisis, Keir Starmer warned on Sunday. In a final pitch before Thursday’s local elections, the Labour leader said that voters were hearing “the dying groans of a clapped-out government” that was attempting to use “desperate attacks and deflections” to distract from inaction over rising bills and tax increases. Writing in the Observer, Starmer said that the government’s decision to press ahead with an increase in national insurance in April was a policy of “profound stupidity and short-sightedness” that was coming at precisely the wrong time. He also launched a personal attack on both Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. “During this election campaign, I have been asked time and time again why the government seems so reluctant, so slow, so timid in its response to the issues facing the country,” he writes. “Spending their time defending the indefensible, creating absurd distractions and squabbling among themselves has left them no space to get on with the jobs they were elected to do. It has rendered them incapable of governing. “We have seen the miserable spectacle of a billionaire chancellor – mired in allegations about his family tax affairs and whether he is profiting from businesses operating out of Russia – declaring that taking action to reduce people’s energy bills would be “silly”. We have heard the prime minister talk about being tough on crime while facing allegations that his party ignored calls from the victim of a Tory MP now convicted of paedophilia. This madness cannot go on.” Sunak has been highly critical of attacks on his wife, Akshata Murthy, who said she would pay all UK tax on foreign earnings in future after it emerged she had non-dom tax status. She also has a stake in her father’s IT firm, Infosys. The company said last month it was withdrawing from Russia. In a bid to win back lost voters who backed leave, Starmer signalled the party’s attempts to move away from the rows over EU membership. He said that the government’s refusal to cut VAT from household energy bills meant they had missed “a genuine Brexit benefit the whole country can get behind”. He accused the Conservatives of wasting police time over their accusation that he had breached lockdown rules when he had a takeaway and a beer with staff in a Durham constituency office while working on a byelection. “In the absence of any idea about where the country is going, what they want to achieve, or how they are going to improve people’s lives, the Tories have resorted to desperate attacks and deflections,” he writes. “Because they have nothing else to say. The sound you can hear is the dying groans of a clapped-out government.” Labour activists have been trying to dampen down expectations that Labour could take the flagship Tory council of Wandsworth on Thursday, but are more confident of making progress in Barnet. Party sources say that it will struggle to win control of many councils because the council seats last came up in 2018, when Labour had a strong result. Some are also braced for council seat losses in areas where the party lost ground to the Tories at the last general election. However, they are hoping to show how Labour’s vote is growing since 2019, with plans to map Thursday’s result on to key battleground seats for the next general election. Starmer said that the national insurance rise was “both a betrayal of the promises he made to the British public at the last election and one of the most self-defeating, damaging decisions a prime minister has taken in recent times”. He again called for energy companies to be made to help with rising bills: “When the cabinet finally got round to having a meeting about the issues this week the big idea that emerged was some nonsense about having fewer MOTs. It would be laughable if it wasn’t so tragic. “On the thinning benches of MPs behind him, I sense something altogether more profound: the dawning realisation that the game is up.”",News/UK news,"Scandals have left PM incapable of governing, says Starmer ",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/30/scandals-have-left-pm-incapable-of-governing-says-starmer
5/1/2022,"The writer Sonia Purnell was sitting in a TV studio, just about to go on air, when the Conservative politician beside her leaned in close. And then, she says, he whispered in her ear a shockingly graphic slur about her sex life. It was meant, she believes, to embarrass and befuddle her just as the cameras rolled; as the author of a highly critical biography of Boris Johnson, she isn’t popular with his supporters. “I wasn’t confident enough to just say ‘this man just said THIS in my ear!’ And yes, of course, afterwards I was a bit flustered,” she remembers. What Purnell describes is an aggressively sexualised form of undermining that many women in politics have experienced down the years. For some it was male MPs mouthing obscenities across the chamber when they rose to speak – Labour women newly elected alongside Tony Blair in 1997 were greeted by Tory MPs shouting “melons!” and making breast-juggling gestures, while Labour’s Lisa Nandy has recalled an MP shouting “knickers!” when she went to sit down in a skirt – and for others, garish smears about their sex lives being spread behind their back. For some, it was a grope or grab. For Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, last week it was anonymous Tory MPs telling the Mail on Sunday that she liked to distract Boris Johnson by flashing her legs at him. But all are forms of sexual shaming, making it clear that no woman is so powerful she can’t instantly be reduced to meat. And it’s the long pent-up fury created by such treatment that finally bubbled over at Tuesday night’s meeting between chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris and the 2022, a new Tory grouping set up by the former women’s minister Maria Miller. Intended to discuss retaining women in politics, it turned into something far more cathartic after one MP accused a male colleague of watching porn on his phone in the chamber. The man was later publicly identified as Neil Parish, who on Saturday resigned after what he described as his “moment of madness”. “The MP who complained, who is no shrinking violet, hadn’t reported it until that moment – I think she was concerned about the pushback from colleagues,” says one of those present. “But that’s why at these meetings the frustration bubbles over so quickly, because people haven’t voiced these things.” A second woman promptly said she too had seen the MP watching porn at work. Heaton-Harris, says the source, was “absolutely stunned. We all were. I mean, I’ve heard a lot of things, but I couldn’t believe that.” And then the floodgates opened. Once the story became public, the international trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan revealed that another ex-MP had pinned her against the wall and insisted she must want him because, he said: “I am a powerful man.” A Labour MP disclosed that an unnamed shadow cabinet minister once told her that women wanted to be her friend and “men want to sleep with you”, although in cruder terms. Caroline Nokes, chair of the women and equalities select committee, said she had experienced “touching, staring, bullying” and been cold-shouldered for speaking up. Secrets withheld even during Westminster’s post-#MeToo outpouring of sexual harassment claims five years ago are tumbling out, amid concerns that reforms introduced following those scandals haven’t lived up to promises. While at least 56 MPs have been reported to the new Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), users say it’s slow and bureaucratic. Although the Conservative whip was removed from the MP Rob Roberts for making repeated and unwanted sexual advances to a male staffer and from David Warburton after allegations of sexual harassment (which Warburton denies), both still sit in parliament. There is irritation with what some see as a “blokey” culture in government that sidelines women, and deeper cross-party frustration that little seems to have changed despite years of painful revelations. The veteran Labour MP Margaret Hodge tweeted that after 50 years of campaigning for equality in public life, “demoralised doesn’t even begin to cover how I feel”. Parliament isn’t quite the rowdy boys’ club it was when I started out as a lobby reporter in 1997. Women political journalists were still a novelty then in a male-dominated world, routinely accused of flirting to get stories. (One afternoon as I hovered in the members’ lobby, where reporters linger to chat privately with MPs, someone asked if I was enjoying “plying my trade on the Reeperbahn”, which is Hamburg’s red light district). The irony is that it was female MPs and advisers, often patronised and briefed against by their own sides, who regularly proved the best sources; at least they took us seriously, and didn’t fondle knees under the table. I still remember a farcical lunch with a senior Labour man, where I kept shuffling my chair out of reach as he shuffled his towards me. At one point he leered: “What do you do that’s dangerous?”, to which I regret not saying, “have lunch with men like you”. The journalist Charlotte Edwardes has accused Boris Johnson himself of squeezing her thigh at lunch when he was editor of the Spectator in the 1990s, something Downing Street has denied. There were darker moments. One woman I knew had to physically fight off the Labour MP who shared her taxi home one night. A Tory wife explained matter-of-factly how she’d learned which bottom-pinching members of her husband’s constituency association to avoid being trapped by. More disturbing was an after-work drink with a Whitehall source who made me uncomfortable for reasons I couldn’t articulate. I cut the evening short. He was later arrested on suspicion of rape. Then, as now, it was junior interns and researchers – women, and young men subject to unwanted advances by MPs – who suffered most, powerless to challenge men on whom their futures in politics depended. But for many of us, to complain seemed embarrassing, career-destroying, and almost as pointless as complaining about the weather, since it was everywhere. What I saw in parliament seemed little different to what happened in newspaper offices, or to friends in the City, or even at university in the 1990s where drunken rugby boys would whip their tackle out in the college bar at night. It was almost what we were conditioned to expect. Those expectations were thankfully changing by 2017, when the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment reached Westminster. Theresa May, by then PM, was publicly committed to bringing women into public life and took a firm line. Defence secretary Michael Fallon was forced out after the journalist Jane Merrick said he’d tried to kiss her. Damian Green, one of May’s oldest friends in cabinet, resigned after an inquiry – triggered by the Tory activist Kate Maltby accusing him of inappropriate advances – found he had misled newspapers about a previous occasion when porn was found on his work computer. A spreadsheet of supposedly “handsy” politicians compiled by junior Westminster women was leaked, and senior ones – including then leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom, Labour’s Jess Phillips and Maria Miller – fought to support the victims and establish what would become the ICGS. But even then, not all complaints were taken seriously. One Tory MP went straight to the whips after being told that one of her male staff was sexually harassing other women, and had allegedly been “rubbing his genitalia on my telephone when I wasn’t in the office”. Although she sacked him, she says now, the evidence she handed over was ignored. “He was re-employed by another Conservative MP, up the corridor, literally 50 yards away from my office.” If Westminster has a problem with women, it’s hardly alone. Last week saw a fresh scandal in the music industry, with the former Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood facing seven separate allegations (which he denies) of sexual misconduct. Two months ago a report found police officers based at Charing Cross police station in London had joked about rape and beating their wives. More than a quarter of Britons were sexually harassed at work in the previous year, according to a 2020 Government Equalities Office survey. For all last week’s debate over what makes Westminster unlike other workplaces, from late-night boozing in its bars to the lack of an HR department, perhaps equally striking are the ways in which it’s similar. Even watching porn in public is now surprisingly widespread: the Commons women and equalities select committee warned in 2018 it was a “real concern” on public transport, recommending a ban. Asking around on Twitter, I heard grim stories of men openly using porn on rush-hour trains (sometimes with the sound up) and buses, in cafes and restaurants, in class at school, even on the public computers in libraries. Lord Bethell, the former Conservative science minister, told me he had challenged one offender on his morning commute and “got a ‘whaaaaaaat’ response”, as if he was the one being unreasonable. But most women hadn’t dared object. It’s unclear whether publicly pawing through porn represents its sheer normalisation in some men’s lives, or a creepier form of digital flashing deliberately intended to make women uncomfortable. But the chilling message it sends is that men can do whatever they like, wherever they like; that however far women think they’ve come, they can always be pushed back into their boxes. It’s that fear of fragile progress unravelling which seems to be driving anger at Westminster. One former Tory MP thinks things started sliding backwards during the parliamentary battle over Brexit, which saw bitter party infighting and a more rightwing, proudly “anti-woke” faction of MPs in the ascendancy. “The party was very split, and the kind of one-nation Conservatives were fair game for all sorts of misogyny. It was all very blokey, and there was kind of a Praetorian Guard in the WhatsApp groups that felt very able to criticise and put down women who were making perfectly valid comments or raising concerns, making derogatory and false comments about women and leaking them to the press.” Some also wonder whether the perception that ministers no longer have to resign for breaching the ministerial code, or the Partygate scandal, have emboldened rogues. “Johnson creates a culture in which it’s felt that whatever you do there aren’t really any consequences, so I think that makes people do things they might not have tried before,” says Sonia Purnell. A former minister argues, however, that the real problem is that cultures only change when that’s continuously driven from the top, and lately that has slipped down the agenda. “It’s not that [Johnson] wouldn’t care about it – it would just never be a priority.” If so, MPs across all parties now plan to make it one. “Women in politics are not victims,” the Labour frontbencher Alison McGovern tweeted. “Change will happen.” And not before time.",News/Politics,"Power, politics and porn: the toxic cocktail that rocked Westminster",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/30/power-politics-and-porn-the-toxic-cocktail-that-rocked-westminster
5/1/2022,"In recent days, people across the country have been receiving their monthly payslips, only to find themselves hundreds of pounds worse off because of the decisions this Tory government has taken. Boris Johnson’s 15th tax rise since taking office has come at the worst possible time. It has compounded the impact of rising prices, soaring bills and runaway inflation. It has made working people worse off. It is a betrayal of the promises he made to the British public at the last election and one of the most self-defeating, damaging decisions a prime minister has taken in recent times. It is a policy of such profound stupidity and shortsightedness, only this Tory party and this prime minister could have come up with it. They cannot say they were not warned. For months, ministers have ignored Labour’s pleas to scrap their tax rise on working people. They have ignored our plans to make oil and gas giants, which have made such incredible profits they refer to themselves as a “cash machine”, pay their fair share. And they have ignored our calls to cut VAT from household bills – a genuine Brexit benefit the whole country can get behind. Taken together, these sensible, practical plans could save households hundreds and hundreds of pounds. But when the cabinet finally got round to having a meeting about the issues last week, the big idea that emerged was some nonsense about having fewer MOTs. It would be laughable if it wasn’t so tragic. During this election campaign, I have been asked time and time again why the government seems so reluctant, so slow, so timid in its response to the issues facing the country. Is it that they can’t act or that they don’t want to? The answer is they simply do not get it. Spending their time defending the indefensible, creating absurd distractions and squabbling among themselves has left them no space to get on with the jobs they were elected to do. It has rendered them incapable of governing. We have seen the miserable spectacle of a billionaire chancellor – mired in allegations about his family tax affairs and whether he is profiting from businesses operating from Russia – declaring that taking action to reduce people’s energy bills would be “silly”. We have heard the prime minister talk about being tough on crime while facing allegations that his party ignored calls from the victim of a Tory MP now convicted of paedophilia. This madness cannot go on. Britain deserves so much better. When Boris Johnson stands in the House of Commons and makes his absurd claims about the state we are in, I see a man who is making it up as he goes along. A man out of touch with the reality of life outside the bubble he operates in. A man who enjoys the trappings of power but is petrified by the reality of it. But on the thinning benches of MPs behind him, I sense something altogether more profound: the dawning realisation that the game is up. For a decade, the Tories have failed to grow the economy. Wages have frozen. Investment has dried up. Particularly outside the big cities, life has got harder and opportunities have disappeared. With nothing left to cut and the economy flatlining, the Tories have decided to place the burden squarely on the shoulders of working people with tax rise after tax rise. In the absence of any idea about where the country is going, what they want to achieve or how they are going to improve people’s lives, the Tories have resorted to desperate attacks and deflections. Why have they and their camp followers spent weeks wasting police time over Labour activists – including me – stopping for dinner during a campaigning session a year ago? Why are they making anonymous sexist attacks on female Labour MPs? Because they have nothing else to say. The sound you can hear is the dying groans of a clapped out government. This Thursday, you have a chance to send the Tories a message. This will not be the sort of local election where vast swaths of councils change hands – but don’t let that put you off. Every vote for Labour is a vote to say that Britain will no longer put up with the Tories’ complacency when it comes to rising bills and prices. That squeezing working people to the pips isn’t a viable way to run an economy. That the sleaze and scandal this government has dragged us through is no one’s fault but their own. Your vote will be heard loud and clear by those enabling this shambolic government. A vote for Labour is a vote for restoring some dignity, pride and honesty to our politics – and for a party that is truly on your side.

5/1/2022,"The Women’s Six Nations trophy is in England’s hands for the fourth consecutive year but they will look to achieve something in the autumn they have not since 2014 – win the World Cup. This tournament has been viewed as a stepping stone to success on the world stage. Their head coach, Simon Middleton, had five games to play with selection and tactics to avoid the heartbreak they suffered in the 2017 World Cup final at the hands of New Zealand. In some ways he has struck gold. England had 21 try-scorers who racked up 45 tries and clocked up 282 points. Their strength in depth to bring in players who not only maintain the standards of the team but score a load of tries is a great asset for the World Cup. This goes as far as blooding new talent. When Emma Sing won her first cap she scored a try for England in the competition, an indication that training is clicking. Middleton knows he can trust whatever team he puts out to bring home the win. The squad experimentation has enabled Middleton to find his preferred starting XV. The team had one change from their Ireland match for Saturday’s finale against France, with Poppy Cleall starting at No 8 for the injured captain, Sarah Hunter. It is the most consistent team game-to-game the Red Roses have had for at least a year. Finding their preferred lineup is essential for England’s World Cup campaign, the cohesion and consistency that can flow through the team will benefit them tenfold. Resilience is another badge of honour the team doubled down on. Their toughest test was always going to come against France and Les Bleues lived up to the hype. England went behind for the first time in the competition with France scoring the opening try. The Red Roses also received their first yellow card of the tournament as Zoe Harrison deliberately knocked on. But England won two penalties in a row and they did not concede a point while a player down. It was exactly the pressure they needed to test themselves against the best and show they can weather storms and still come out on top. The victory moved England on to a 23-match winning streak, one off the record in international rugby. But it has not all been rosy for England and there are areas they need to work on. A glaring problem is their handling. When England were patient in their attack they were almost guaranteed to score. Yet when they forced quick play or tried to be flashy with a long pass, they either knocked on or had to deal with a bouncing ball. The side made 80 handling errors in the tournament, the most coming against Italy when they recorded 22. They were lucky on occasion that opponents did not pounce on an intercept and at the World Cup the Black Ferns and Australia will surely not be as forgiving. If they can eliminate the sloppiness, the attack will have an extra string in their bow. If not, it could be fatal. Set-pieces have not been perfect either. Their lineouts against Wales were exploited and they quickly corrected being dominated at the scrum against Ireland. But their driving maul was the most successful in the tournament, bringing 11 tries from the set-piece. The forwards coach, Louis Deacon, has ample material to correct those errors or at least give the set-piece more consistency. The Women’s Six Nations has been a great springboard for England. They have discovered their best team, have had a perfect run of results and also identified weaknesses. Those lessons, if learned, will benefit the team, who are in a prime position to bring home the World Cup.",Sport/Sport,Simon Middleton strikes gold as he tests England tactics before World Cup | Sarah Rendell,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/30/simon-middleton-strikes-gold-as-he-tests-englands-world-cup-tactics
5/1/2022,"The Tree of Trees, an object to be erected outside Buckingham Palace for the Queen’s jubilee, is, according to the studio of its designer, Thomas Heatherwick, a “sculpture” that “seeks to put the importance of trees and nature at the heart of this historic milestone”. Here I’ll pass by the abuse of metaphors (do milestones have hearts?) but not of trees, this being another case of certain designers’ mania for picking them up, moving them around and putting them where they don’t want to be. This 21 metre-high steel structure will carry 350 small trees, planted in aluminium pots, which will be distributed around the country after the jubilee. It is approximately tree-shaped, but this awkward, angular construction is not much like an actual living organism. It is a tree emoji realised with structural engineering. It has strong vibes of the Marble Arch Mound, the disastrous artificial hill erected last year. Here, as there, a cartoon version of nature is placed in a London ceremonial space by people who don’t seem to have thought much about what it is that makes trees lovely. Those words from the studio also take liberties with the idea of art. They call the Tree of Trees a “sculpture”. Boris Johnson may once have compared Heatherwick to Michelangelo, but David it is not. In other news from the plant kingdom, it has emerged that Donald Trump was so scared of being injured by fruit that he urged his security to attack protesters. “You can get killed with those things,” he said, in a deposition to a New York court. “Tomatoes are bad, by the way. But it’s very dangerous… pineapples, tomatoes, bananas, stuff like that, yeah, it’s dangerous stuff.” It’s hard not to make a comparison with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the man whom Trump once tried to bully into manufacturing political smears. The Ukrainian leader braves hit squads and bombs in Kyiv; the former US president cowers from tomatoes. Last month, the high court overturned the decision of the government to grant planning permission to the proposed UK Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre. Its problem was with the location in Victoria Tower Gardens, a small, Grade II-listed park next to parliament. The court found that the proposal breached a 1900 law that required the gardens to be kept as open space. As has been clear since David Cameron announced the plan more than six years ago, the scale of the proposal would be devastating to a small and vulnerable garden. The biggest problem is not the memorial itself, but the decision to accompany it with a learning centre, which requires the construction of a substantial enclosed building. It is heart-rending that there has been such a waste of energy, resources and goodwill, through lengthy planning processes and a public inquiry, to reach what should always have been an obvious conclusion. But there is now the chance to create something worthy of the catastrophe the memorial is meant to remember. The learning centre could be located somewhere else, most obviously the Imperial War Museum, which already has outstanding galleries dedicated to the Holocaust. Conceivably a memorial, if it consists of a landscape or of one of more objects rather than a building, could yet be built in the gardens without contravening the 1900 law. On Friday, it was announced that the government has appealed against the high court’s decision, which is a pity. It should rather take the opportunity of its verdict to apply the intelligence and sensitivity that it should have shown at the outset.
