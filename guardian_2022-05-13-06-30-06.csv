5/13/2022,"Good morning. The Coalition has made almost $3bn in spending promises across 10 marginal seats ahead of the election. Female candidates are being overlooked to run in safe seats by both major parties. And fiction writers reflect on how they can help galvanise readers to take action against the climate crisis. Outgoing Liberal National party politician Andrew Laming says the expenses watchdog has done “nothing” since he publicly refused to pay back more than $8,000 in travel expenses he was found by it to have wrongly claimed. The Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority audited a single month of Laming’s travel in 2020, finding he had wrongly claimed 21 expenses and issuing an invoice. But Laming refused to pay the money back, and says he has heard nothing and expects to hear nothing. The Coalition has made almost $3bn in spending promises across 10 marginal seats, including a surprising $300m to try to flip the Labor seat of McEwen in Melbourne’s outer north. The knife-edge seats of Bass in Tasmania and Gilmore on the New South Wales south coast have attracted the most pork-barrelling commitments from the Liberal party, with more than $500m promised to projects in Bass and $430m in Gilmore. Meanwhile, Labor says it will establish a national threatened species program and provide a full response to the independent review of national environmental laws if it forms government. Urgent measures to break the Russian blockade of grain exports from Ukraine’s ports, including by trying to open routes through Romanian and Baltic ports, will be discussed by G7 foreign and agriculture ministers at meetings in Germany. The grain exports blockade is fast becoming one of the most urgent diplomatic and humanitarian crises in Ukraine. Meanwhile nearly 100 children have been killed in Ukraine since April alone, according to Unicef, which warned the war was creating a “child protection and child rights crisis”. Female candidates are being overlooked to run in safe seats by both major parties, with new analysis showing just two in 10 female candidates have been put forward for winnable seats at this year’s election, while safe seats are “saved for the boys”. Research from the Australian National University’s global institute for women’s leadership shows that just 20% of female candidates running for the Coalition are contesting safe seats. For the Labor party it is 24%. A plan to “electrify everything” with rooftop solar, batteries and electric vehicles would save households across the country more than $5,000 a year and particularly benefit those living in outer Melbourne suburbs, according to a new analysis. Many more rural Australians may have no choice but to spend their final years away from their families and communities given two-thirds of regional aged care homes are operating at a loss. With wine vintages wiped out by bushfire and workers ready to transition out of the coalmining industry, the electorate of Calare in the NSW central west could be ready to change from a Nationals MP to an independent one. Economists and advocacy groups have seized on the Morrison government’s objection to lifting minimum wages by the inflation rate, noting benefits such as pensions are tied to how consumer prices change. Shireen Abu Aqleh, the Palestinian American journalist shot dead during an Israeli army operation, has been honoured with a full state memorial in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Meanwhile, Israel has approved 2,700 housing units in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. A delegation of influential US congressmen will fly to London within days amid growing concern in the White House about spiralling tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol. With the UK government poised to table legislation next week which could revoke parts of the protocol, arrangements are being made for at least half a dozen representatives from the US Congress to fly to Europe. North Korea has declared a “severe national emergency” after confirming its first outbreak of Covid-19, prompting its leader, Kim Jong-un, to vow to quickly eliminate the virus. After a month of crippling ransomware attacks, Costa Rica has declared a state of emergency invoking a measure usually reserved to deal with natural disasters or the Covid-19 pandemic to allow the government to react more nimbly to the crisis. California’s governor has announced a new reproductive health spending plan, dedicating an additional $57m to prepare for an influx of people from other states seeking abortions in California. Writers aren’t science experts, Kate Grenville writes. But they may be able to influence their readers to cast their ballots for the climate. “A vote for climate will put it where it should be, and where polls say many people put it,” she says. “At the centre of every life.” Acclaimed author Chloe Hooper seeks “the perfect children’s picture book of death” to help her sons – and herself – come to terms with their father’s illness. The horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made the whole world afraid of the atomic bomb – even those who might have launched one. Today that fear has mostly passed out of living memory, and with it we may have lost a crucial safeguard. Each week of the election campaign, Guardian Australia’s politics team answers questions from listeners. This week we cover how minor party preferences will affect the outcome, who are the most talented politicians in the country and the blurring of lines between government grants and election promises.

5/13/2022,"The US justice department secretly issued a subpoena to gain access to details of the phone account of a Guardian reporter as part of an aggressive leak investigation into media stories about an official inquiry into the Trump administration’s child separation policy at the southern border. Leak investigators issued the subpoena to obtain the phone number of Stephanie Kirchgaessner, the Guardian’s investigations correspondent in Washington. The move was carried out without notifying the newspaper or its reporter, as part of an attempt to ferret out the source of media articles about a review into family separation conducted by the Department of Justice’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz. It is highly unusual for US government officials to obtain a journalist’s phone details in this way, especially when no national security or classified information is involved. The move was all the more surprising in that it came from the DoJ’s inspector general’s office – the watchdog responsible for ethical oversight and whistleblower protections. Katharine Viner, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, decried the action as “an egregious example of infringement on press freedom and public interest journalism by the US Department of Justice”. She added: “We will be asking the DoJ urgently for an explanation for why and how this could have occurred, and for an apology. We will also be seeking assurances that our reporter’s details will be erased from DoJ systems and will not be used for any further infringements of press freedom.” The leak inquiry was conducted on behalf of the DoJ by the inspector general’s office of an outside government department, housing and urban development (Hud). Its investigation focused on allegations that an employee within the DoJ’s inspector general’s office had leaked sensitive information to three news outlets – the Guardian, the New York Times and NBC News. The Guardian was the only one of the three outlets to have a subpoena issued relating to its reporter’s phone account. The Guardian published two sensitive reports by Kirchgaessner within the timeframe of the DoJ review into child separation covered by the leak inquiry. On 23 July 2020 she revealed that the DoJ’s former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein had personally advised that migrant parents should be prosecuted, no matter how young the children accompanying them. On 2 September 2020, Kirchgaessner reported that a senior justice department official nominated by Trump to be a federal judge had participated in the removal of a Texas prosecutor who had sounded the alarm over child separation. On Thursday, the investigative reporter Jason Leopold released a redacted version of the Hud leak inquiry report obtained under freedom of information laws. It revealed that leak investigators had reviewed evidence of 127 phone calls totalling about six hours in length with “phone numbers identified as belonging to reporter Stephanie Kirchgaessner of the Guardian”, and an additional 126 phone calls about six hours and 20 minutes “with a phone number identified as belonging to the Guardian generally”. The leak report also discloses that the DoJ issued an “administrative subpoena” to a telecommunications company for “subscriber information to confirm that a specific telephone number belonged to the Guardian”. It said that “basic subscriber information” had been obtained involving “names, addresses, and length of service only” and “not the contents of communications”. Child separation was effected in 2018 under the Trump administration. Known officially as “zero tolerance”, the policy ordered federal prosecutors to act against undocumented immigrants entering the US unlawfully even when minors were present – a reversal of previous practice which had spared families from criminal proceedings in order to avoid children being separated from their parents. The policy led to more than 3,000 children being separated from their parent or guardian, and to widespread chaos in which the location of many children became unknown. The much-delayed DoJ inspector general’s report into the practice was finally published after two years, in January 2021. Earlier this week Politico reported that an employee of the DoJ inspector general’s office had “abruptly resigned” after coming under scrutiny from the leak investigation.",News/US news,US secretly issued subpoena to access Guardian reporter’s phone records,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/12/us-government-subpoena-guardian-reporter-phone-records
5/13/2022,"Huddersfield Giants moved into Super League’s top four courtesy of victory against second-placed Wigan in the dress rehearsal for this month’s Challenge Cup final. The Giants and the Warriors will meet at Tottenham in a fortnight with the biggest prize in rugby league on the line but here, Ian Watson’s side continued their ascent up the league with another encouraging win. Led by the outstanding Tui Lolohea throughout, Huddersfield backed up last week’s win against Hull KR at Elland Road with another impressive display that ensured Wigan missed the chance to move top of Super League despite a late fightback in the final quarter. BothThe sides made 15 changes between them in the wake of their respective semi-final victories last weekend, with Huddersfield making eight, and Wigan seven. But it was the hosts who started the brighter of the two sides, taking a deserved lead after six minutes when a crisp play direct from a scrum led to Louis Senior diving over in the corner. Senior should have added a second shortly after, but was denied by Bevan French. Huddersfield spurned a number of chances in a one-sided opening quarter before the sin-binning of Joe Greenwood gave Wigan their first opportunity to apply some pressure. However, their young half-back pairing of Harry Smith and the debutant, Logan Astley, were unable to make Wigan’s man advantage count. And before Greenwood returned, Huddersfield moved 12-0 ahead courtesy of a superb solo effort from Ricky Leutele. Wigan’s rotated side had flattered to deceive to that point, but it was no surprise that the try which brought them back into the game came from the outstanding Bevan French. His break from deep was eventually finished by Sam Halsall and despite all of Huddersfield’s dominance, they led by just six at half-time. Lolohea was a menace to Wigan’s defence throughout that first half and shortly after the restart, his long-range pass found Senior unmarked in the corner to claim his second, before the fullback then laid another try on a plate for Jake Wardle to move Huddersfield ahead by 16 heading into the final quarter. Wigan came to life in the final 15 minutes though courtesy of Sam Halsall and a brace from the debutant, Matty Nicholson. However, a clever kick from Theo Fages found Sam Hewitt either side of Nicholson’s two tries before Senior completed his hat-trick in the dying seconds to calm the nerves among home supporters.",Sport/Sport,Louis Senior hat-trick puts Huddersfield on way to victory over Wigan,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/12/huddersfield-wigan-super-league-match-report-rugby-league
5/13/2022,"World Rugby has insisted that the proposed north versus south “Nations Championship” competition – including a grand final between the two hemispheres every two years – will not detract from the prestige of the World Cup after expressing confidence the new tournament will get off the ground. Key stakeholders, including representatives from the Six Nations and Sanzaar, have been locked in discussions in Dublin this week in an effort to resolve the remaining stumbling blocks. A well-placed source has said that all parties have “broadly agreed” the format of the competition but concerns linger over how revenues will be shared, the effects of promotion and relegation and the need to agree new player release deals with clubs – although the Guardian understands there is more collaboration than three years ago, when a similar proposal failed. While the aim of bringing more meaning to the July and November Tests windows has been generally well-received, the main criticism of the proposal is that it would devalue the World Cup, which remains World Rugby’s jewel in the crown. The Nations Championship would not take place in World Cup or British & Irish Lions years, however, and World Rugby’s chief executive Alan Gilpin said: “We have to be confident, firstly, that we can deliver outstanding World Cups and that the World Cups are the biggest moments in the sport – and they are. [The players] have been engaged through this whole process of the global competition discussions. “Constantly you hear from the players that the World Cup is the biggest moment. For World Cups to be more competitive, which is what all the players and fans want, we need this shift in the calendar and the competition models, so they’re just inextricably linked. We’ll try and persuade people who are listening that world champions isn’t the right name.” Gilpin also revealed that regardless of whether the proposal comes to pass for the Six Nations, the Sanzaar countries, Fiji and Japan, World Rugby is determined to press ahead with plans for a second tier competition to launch in 2024 for nations such as Georgia, Samoa and Tonga, which in an ideal world, would see promotion to the top tier if it materialises. He added: “We’re not going to wait until 2026 to create some of the emerging nations competitions that sit around that, because we can put those pieces in place now. And in all honesty, putting those pieces in place helps to drive the wider discussion.”",Sport/Sport,"‘Nations Championship’ will not detract from World Cup, claims World Rugby",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/12/nations-championship-will-not-detract-from-world-cup-claims-world-rugby
5/13/2022,"For Antonio Conte, the delight lay in the dominance. It was physical, his Tottenham players running all over their Arsenal rivals; battering them, pounding them into submission. It was psychological, the visitors seeming to crumble in the face of a ferociously intense atmosphere. And it was tactical, Conte’s approach looking quick and incisive; easy on the eye. Spurs knew that they had to win to keep alive their hopes of pipping Arsenal into fourth place. They did that and more. This was a statement performance and one to seriously test their nearest and not so dearest. Arsenal do retain control of their destiny, with a regards to a Champions League finish, but Mikel Arteta has regrouping work to do before the pivotal trip to Newcastle on Monday. Son Heung-min tormented the Arsenal defence, winning a penalty that Harry Kane converted for 1-0 and spooking Rob Holding to such an extent that the centre-half was sent off for two fouls on him before the 33rd minute was up. Kane would score again, Son added the third and the home crowd came together in appreciation of Conte towards the end. It is fair to say that everyone had been waiting for this. Since mid-January, when the original fixture was postponed after an application by Arsenal, who had a selection crisis. And, more broadly, since the stadium opened. At long last, the derby here could pulse to the rhythms of a sell-out. There was quite the noise inside the bowl – the acoustics really are something – and the Spurs fans in the South Stand had spelled out what they wanted in a striking tifo. Dare, Dream, Do. They got their wish during a first half which had an almost gladiatorial feel. It was Spurs who won the duels and it came to feel as if the occasion was too hot for Arteta’s young team. The visitors blinked first when Cédric Soares barged Son at the far post as the Spurs attacker chased a Dejan Kulusevski cross. Arteta raged, just as Conte had done moments earlier, protesting a yellow card against Ben Davies and earning one for himself. But the penalty was the correct decision and there was little doubt over the outcome when Kane addressed it. Cédric versus Son had felt like a potential mismatch, although not like this – in an aerial challenge. The same was true of Holding versus Son. The pair had grappled on the floor in the early going and, when Son turned away from him on 26 minutes, beating him all ends up, Holding fouled him. He had his first caution. Plainly, Holding had to tread carefully. Instead, just eight minutes later, he watched Son cut across him in pursuit of a high Eric Dier ball and checked him with no little cynicism. What was he thinking about? The second yellow card was a formality. Spurs scented blood. Roared on by the crowd, they pressed high, winning their tackles. It was looking like an ordeal for those in red. Moments before Holding’s dismissal, Kane had seen a shot blocked by Takehiro Tomiyasu. He did not have to wait long for his second. It was Rodrigo Bentancur who flicked on a Son corner and Kane was all alone at the far post to stoop low and head home. The half-time damage could have been heavier but, after Tomiyasu had again blocked from Kane, Ryan Sessegnon stood up a lovely cross and Emerson Royal lifted wastefully over. Spurs’ third was a killer on every level for Arsenal. There was the timing – straight after half-time. But there was the sight yet again of a Tottenham player bullying his opponent. It was Kane this time, backing into Gabriel, trying to roll him and the Arsenal player struggling to hold his ground. With both men on the ground, the ball broke to Son, who lifted an assured finish past Aaron Ramsdale. Arsenal had wilted in the first half, their attacking threat limited, with only Eddie Nketiah troubling Hugo Lloris with a 44th minute effort. And when Son scored the third, it was plain that they needed a miracle. Perhaps stopping the bleeding had to be the priority. Arteta reconfigured to 4-1-3-1 – Tomiyasu alongside Gabriel in central defence; Granit Xhaka at left-back. Bukayo Saka was denied by Davies but there were oles from the home crowd, delight at how their team had their boot on Arsenal’s throat. And clemency was not a part of the mood. Kane worked Ramsdale from distance and Son lifted over from a Sessegnon cross when he should have done better. Arsenal, who lost Gabriel to injury and finished with Xhaka in central defence, went close through Martin Ødegaard. For them, there was no consolation.",Sport/Football,Harry Kane double sees off 10-man Arsenal to boost Spurs’ top-four chances,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/12/tottenham-arsenal-premier-league-match-report
5/13/2022,"A 3D image of the scene where Sheku Bayoh was restrained by police has been shown at a long-awaited inquiry into his death while in custody. The reconstruction was presented along with visual and audio recordings taken from CCTV, witnesses’ phones and emergency calls in a public hearing led by the retired appeal court judge Lord Bracadale. Bayoh died after being restrained by officers who were responding to calls from members of the public of a man brandishing a large knife. Two police vans, three marked police cars and one unmarked car, and at least nine uniformed police officers attended the scene in Kirkcaldy, Fife, on 3 May 2015. After no charges were brought against any of the officers involved, the Scottish government announced the inquiry into the case five years after Bayoh’s death. The 31-year-old’s family believe race played a part in his death, but the facts have yet to be fully established. The inquiry was first shown dashcam footage taken at 7.09am from a car that captured Bayoh walking through Kirkcaldy on the day he died. Alongside this, an audio recording of the 999 call made by the driver was played, in which he could be heard reporting seeing “a 6ft black guy … around Hayfield Road”. Several other emergency calls from witnesses about a sighting of a man with a knife were played, with one saying: “There’s a black man walking along … He has a knife in his hand … He’s walking towards the hospital.” A call at 7.20am from a police control room confirmed that officers were approaching the location of Bayoh, with CCTV footage capturing police vehicles arriving at the scene seconds later. Another call between the control room and a former officer, Alan Paton, who attended the scene, was played alongside the footage, with Paton heard asking the description of the man upon approach. An officer was recorded replying: “He’s been described as a male, black, well-built, 6ft tall, wearing a white T-shirt, dark-coloured jeans and carrying a very large knife.” Seconds later, Paton could be heard shouting over the radio: “Officer injured, PC Short.” Further shouting ensued before an officer at the scene reported back to the control room at about 7.21am. “One officer has been punched in the back of the head, no obvious serious injuries,” he was heard saying. “Male securely on the ground.” An officer in the control room asked for an update at 7.22am, again repeating the request a minute later, prompting an officer at the scene to reply: “The male is on the ground at the moment. We’ve got several officers who’ve taken a big restrain. “We’ll get back to you. However, we’re going to need more control … generally fine.” Footage lasting just seconds taken from a witness’s Snapchat post showed Bayoh on the ground being restrained by officers. An audio recording was played of another officer at the scene reporting: “PC Short has been struck to the head … no bleeding, no visible injury.” Another officer replied: “Yes, just continue to stay safe and keep full control. Use all restrains necessary. Control, can you get an ambulance for PC Short?” At just after 7.25am, attending officers noticed that Bayoh was unresponsive, with one reporting: “The male appears to be unconscious, breathing, not responsive. Get an ambulance for him.” The inquiry saw an ambulance arrive at 7.34am through a reconstructed 3D image using CCTV footage from the nearby pub Gallagher’s and a radio-call recording. Bayoh, a father of two, moved to Scotland from Sierra Leone as a young teenager to live with his sister. He was training to be a gas engineer, and had no previous history of violence. The inquiry continues.",News/UK news,Sheku Bayoh inquiry shown 3D image of scene where police restrained him,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/12/sheku-bayoh-inquiry-3d-image-scene-police
