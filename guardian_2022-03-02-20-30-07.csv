3/2/2022,"On Monday I left my hometown of Kyiv in a car driven by volunteers from the territorial defence force. The roads were empty except where there were lines at makeshift checkpoints, blockades built up to defend the city. Buildings around the city are damaged and destroyed, and you can see military planes in the sky. We believed this could happen, but never thought it would. We knew Putin was mad after his occupation of the Crimea and Donbas. We understood that this – an invasion – would be a disaster for Europe and for the entire globe, so we hoped some sense of logic still remained in his head. But still it happened. We are shocked and angry. We will never forgive it. Putin always said that Russians and Ukrainians and Belarusians were brothers. But listening to him now you can see how deeply he hates the state, and the people, of Ukraine. He hates us because we resisted him and tried to reform our country. We still do. You see people without weapons in the streets trying to stop tanks. We protest. And we pay a very high price. Many of our best people will be killed doing this. The most incredible thing is the support among the people. I was scared to wake up in my high-rise apartment to explosions last Thursday. In the next few days as the situation worsened in the city I slept in the bathroom – the safest room, they say – and in the car park below my building, and one night in the metro station. In the stations people share food, and they set up games and theatres using projectors with sheets for the children. Kids are kids, they need parts of a normal life. There are volunteers doing everything. The metros still run sometimes. People build barriers against tanks. They try to keep the city functioning by delivering food and other goods that people need. One of my colleagues used to be a medical nurse so she joined a volunteer medical group. Today she went out to care for people with cancer who can’t get regular hospital care. Putin’s strategy was to beat us in a few days. He failed. The nation is united. We have found a way to function, and survive. But this means they are even more desperate to spread fear. They are shelling areas where people live, including schools and hospitals. They’re violating all rules of war. All laws. They have killed civilians. The latest report was 352, including 14 children. And the real number will be much higher. They want people to lose faith. But we will fight. I chose to leave Kyiv, and the volunteers help with that too. The territorial defence force volunteers can pick you up in a car and take you out of the city if you are lucky. I left this way, and my sister and some others came along. But many choose to stay. And I know friends and colleagues in other cities close to the Russian border that are surrounded by Russian forces, like Chernihiv and Sumy. It is extremely difficult to get out. The Ukrainians are still in control of the city, but no one can evacuate. Right now I’m in the Rivne region, in the north-west of the country. But still I don’t feel safe. I worked at a human rights organisation in the Crimea. Before the war the Russians had a list of of activists and journalists that they would kill or send to camps when they occupied Ukraine. After all those years of working in that field, I don’t feel safe. And besides, I am now near the Belarusian border, so if they join the intervention I won’t be safe either. The world has now seen on its screens what is happening. We demand a stop to this bloodshed and the crimes that you are seeing are happening right now in Europe. I sometimes feel like it is a bad dream, but I assure you it isn’t. It isn’t even far away. We are fighting. But we need support. We call on every western government to take the steps needed to stop Putin. We need shelter from the sky. We want a no-fly zone. We cannot defend ourselves as we are being bombed. We want all Russian banks blocked from the Swift system – not only the seven that were already shut out – and Belarusian banks, too. The financial system behind Putin must collapse. Western business should stop trading in Russia and Belarus, and all companies should close their offices there. Russia should also be excluded from the UN security council. If the UN is not the League of Nations – which failed to stop the second world war – it cannot allow an aggressor to block its actions. All I could think of while driving in the car away from Kyiv is that we must believe this will lead to the end of Russia in its current state. We need to fight back where Putin has destroyed the media and eroded civil society. Where he acts with impunity. Where he invades countries like the new Hitler. Where other western states say they are “deeply concerned”, but do nothing about it. We are defending democracy in the face of all of this. And we are paying the highest price.

3/2/2022,"Fletch and Liam have been best friends since they were six. But tomorrow, Liam is off to Oxford University. “I’m your mate,” Fletch tells him. “That should mean something. That should mean you don’t just leave.” We are introduced to the 18-year-olds in a car park in Worcester at the height of their platonic love story. With boyish ease, they spring from the two grey doors on Lucy Sierra’s set and playfully discuss the “fit girls” they’ve grown up with. Impulsively aggressive, they fight hard enough that Fletch (Kyle Rowe) makes Liam’s lip bleed, yet their violence is also layered with tenderness. As Liam (Eddie-Joe Robinson) leaves, he swears things will stay “like always” between them. Samuel Bailey’s follow up to his 2019 Papatango prize-winning debut, Shook, is an intricate and moving study of social mobility. Robinson skilfully builds a confused sense of identity into his portrayal of Liam, who drops his accent but seems uncomfortable wearing tail suits while at Oxford. “Which one is the real Lee?” Fletch spits at him during a surprise visit. What makes Bailey’s writing so gripping is the characters’ nuance. As the narrative tumbles forwards, Liam manages to be simultaneously the same and different. Fletch, burningly played by Rowe, is a flawed mess of lovability. As the once unified pair descend into resentment, it is clear to Liam that the cost of education might be losing everything he’s ever known. Directed by Jesse Jones, Bailey’s script is brought to life by movement segments that break the scenes. As Liam leaves for university, one of the on stage doors swings open, lit up, for him to walk through. As Fletch scrambles to join him, it brutally shuts in his face. Accompanied by a menacing sound design by Asaf Zohar, this repeated action makes visible the sense of lost opportunity. Though not a particularly surprising story, it’s still a significant one.

3/2/2022,"In his latest video address to the nation on Wednesday morning, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia was seeking to erase Ukraine, its history and people as he reiterated his appeal for the EU to fast-track its membership application: “This is no time to be neutral.” There is an urgency to the Ukrainian president’s calls and, naturally, as images of the carnage in Ukraine’s cities beam back to Brussels, there is significant sympathy with his cause. An emotive speech to the European parliament on Tuesday, in which Zelenskiy had beseeched the union to “prove that you are with us”, won a long, standing ovation and a ringing endorsement from MEPs in a non-binding resolution that called on Ukraine to be given EU candidate status. Kyiv’s urgency appears to stem from an analysis of a potential “way out” of the conflict with Russia, according to EU officials in almost daily discussions with Zelenskiy’s administration. If anything approaching coherent can be gleaned from Vladimir Putin’s demands of the Ukrainians, it is that the country should be demilitarised, neutral, and that it should have no prospect of joining the Nato military alliance. These instructions are evidently unreasonable to make to a sovereign government. But if there is a diplomatic way out of the crisis, sources suggest that some sort of fig leaf to Putin on the military side might form part of an agreement if Kyiv felt confident that its political future, at least, firmly lay with the EU. “I think one of the reasons that this is important for President Zelenskiy is also potentially in some of the discussions with Russia on a way out,” said one EU official. “I view myself the European Union as a project that is grounded and based upon peace, the solving of conflict through dialogue through working together. I don’t think the European Union has a record of presenting a military threat to any partners.” One set of talks with Kremlin representatives has been concluded but further sessions are expected. The official added: “I think in any agreement that President Zelenskiy may reach with President Putin, getting a guarantee that there is support understanding for Ukraine belonging one day to the European Union is likely to be very important for Zelenskiy and for the Ukrainian people.” Beyond MEPs, the governments of the Baltic states, as well as a number of other countries including Greece, have indicated their support. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, responded that Ukraine was “one of us and we want them in the EU”. But there is significant concern in other EU capitals that this is an emotional reaction that will lead to disappointment and bitterness. Albania, the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey are the current EU candidate countries. But Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has been vocal in stressing that given the failure of the EU to respond adequately to the democratic deficit in Poland and Hungary, or to find a way to have a coordinated foreign policy due to the rules on unanimity, there cannot be any enlargement until there have been treaty reforms. Back at an EU-Ukraine summit in 2008, the country’s then president, Viktor Yushchenko, said “the message he received from the EU was full of hope and promise”. But Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were among those who blocked any reference in a joint communique to a path to membership. Today, according to Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, Ukraine is the second most corrupt in Europe, ahead of Russia. It is now waging a war. Its future borders are unclear. And the path to membership is arduous. If the Council of the European Union agrees, the European Commission will be asked to give an opinion, and that process can take up to 18 months. Ukraine will then have to absorb EU law over an indefinite period of transition. It is expected that EU leaders will be asked to discuss Ukraine’s application at an upcoming summit. There may be warm words. But Ukraine may be advised not to bank much at all on what could prove to be more empty promises.",News/World news,Ukraine’s bid for fast-track membership of EU likely to end in disappointment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/ukraine-bid-fast-track-membership-eu-likely-end-disappointment-zelenskiy
3/2/2022,"The French far-right leader and presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has been forced to defend her links to Vladimir Putin following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Le Pen, who polls suggest will face Emmanuel Macron in the second round of the vote in April, has faced criticism after a campaign leaflet featuring a photograph of her with the Russian leader was released. Her Rassemblement National (RN) party, denied it had ordered local party offices to destroy the document after 1.2m copies were printed and distributed last month. The eight-page pamphlet highlight’s Le Pen’s international status featuring photographs of her with world leaders, including Putin. It is still available on Le Pen’s campaign website. Le Pen travelled to Moscow where she met the Russian president in the run-up to the 2017 presidential election. In October 2014, the far-right party, then called the Front National, borrowed €9m from a Russian bank to finance its election campaigns. Le Pen has criticised Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the pamphlet does not appear to have damaged her popularity. One recent opinion poll suggests she has gained one percentage point, taking her to 17%, well behind Macron, but ahead of her rightwing rivals, Eric Zemmour and the mainstream opposition Les Républicains candidate, Valérie Pécresse. Libération reported that local party officers had been ordered to destroy the pamphlet, but the RN has denied giving any such order. “The document is still being distributed by our activists,” David Rachline, the RN vice-president, said. A party official said the RN would not be back-pedalling. “We are not going to deny our position on international politics. In 2017, we had to work with Russia to combat Islamic state … no major issue can have a lasting solution without the cooperation of at least the security council,” the official told BFMTV. He added the party had been asked whether local campaigners should destroy the pamphlet following Russia’s attack on Ukraine, but had told them “non”. However, Le Pen told French media the war had “partly changed“ her view of the Russian president. “Yes, it’s an authoritarian regime, historically and in culture. Even if we are judging (it) by our Western norms which are not Russian norms,” she told BFMTV. She added the invasion of Ukraine was “a clear violation straight of international law and absolutely indefensible”. “We can try to explain what can explain it, but we cannot in any way excuse this behaviour,” Le Pen said, adding that it was for Europe, not the US, to manage the situation. “Russia is a great power, a great nuclear power, and it’s on our continent so it’s for us to find solutions to live with it,” she said. Of meeting the Russian president in 2017, she replied: “The Vladimir Putin of five years ago is not exactly that of today,” adding that he had “crossed a red line” in attacking Ukraine. A poll by Ifop-Fiducial for Paris Match suggested that at 17%, her highest score for a fortnight, Le Pen remains far behind Macron on 28% of intentions to vote, but had pulled ahead of Zemmour and Pécresse, on 13%. Zemmour, who has condemned the Russian invasion but said “if Putin is guilty, the west is responsible” and also said France should not welcome Ukrainians fleeing the conflict and they should stay in Poland, lost 2.5 percentage points in two days, according to the poll. Jean-Yves Camus, a political analyst and far-right specialist, told Ouest France that sympathy with Russia was more damaging for Zemmour because Le Pen’s view of Putin was already well known to her supporters. “Le Pen can argue that she was obliged to take a €9m loan with a Russian bank because no French bank would lend her the money,” Camus said.",News/World news,French far-right leader Marine Le Pen forced to defend Putin links,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/french-far-right-leader-marine-le-pen-forced-to-defend-putin-links
3/2/2022,"In 2014, the Putin regime invaded Ukraine’s Crimea. In 2016, the same regime invaded the United States. The former took place as a conventional military operation; the latter was a spectacular case of cyberwarfare, including disinformation that it was happening at all and promulgation of a lot of talking points still devoutly repeated by many. It was a vast social-media influencing project that took many forms as it sought to sow discord and confusion, even attempting to dissuade Black voters from voting. Additionally, Russian intelligence targeted voter rolls in all 50 states, which is not thought to have had consequences, but demonstrated the reach and ambition of online interference. This weekend, British investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr said on Twitter, “We failed to acknowledge Russia had staged a military attack on the West. We called it ’meddling.’ We used words like ‘interference.’ It wasn’t. It was warfare. We’ve been under military attack for eight years now.” As she notes, Putin’s minions were not only directing their attention to the United States, and included pro-Brexit efforts and support for France’s far-right racist National Front party. The US interference – you could call it cyberwarfare, or informational invasion – took many forms. Stunningly, a number of left-wing news sources and pundits devoted themselves to denying the reality of the intervention and calling those who were hostile to the Putin regime cold-war red-scare right-wingers, as if contemporary Russia was a glorious socialist republic rather than a country ruled by a dictatorial ex-KGB agent with a record of murdering journalists, imprisoning dissenters, embezzling tens of billions and leading a global neofascist white supremacist revival. In discrediting the news stories and attacking critics of the Russian government, they provided crucial cover for Trump. In her 2019 testimony to House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, former National Security Agency staffer Fiona Hill declared, “Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies, confirmed in bipartisan congressional reports. It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlying details must remain classified. The impact of the successful 2016 Russian campaign remains evident today. Our nation is being torn apart; truth is questioned; our highly professional expert career Foreign Service is being undermined. US support for Ukraine, which continues to face armed aggression, is being politicized. President Putin and the Russian security services aim to counter US foreign policy objectives in Europe, including in Ukraine, where Moscow wishes to reassert political and economic dominance.” The assertions of interference were compelling all along. On October 7, 2016, US intelligence agencies released a bombshell press release declaring “The US Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.” In one of the weirdest days in US political history, the Access Hollywood tape of Trump boasting about sexually assaulting women was released half an hour later, and half an hour after that, “WikiLeaks began tweeting links to emails hacked from the personal account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.” Wikileaks is thought to have gotten its material from the Russian intelligence agency GRU; longtime Republican operative and Trump ally Roger Stone appears to have been a liason between Wikileaks and the Trump team. On October 30, 2016, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reidput out a furious letter to then-FBI director James Comey, charging “it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government – a foreign interest hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity.” He demanded, unsuccessfully, that Comey publicize this information. On October 31, Obama contacted called Putin on the nuclear risk reductions hotline to demand he stop this interference, but the public didn’t know about this until after Trump had lost the popular vote but won the electoral college. Of course the most striking role of the Russian government in the 2016 US election was its many, many ties with the Trump campaign, including with Trump himself, who spent the campaign and the four years of his presidency groveling before Putin, denying the reality of Russian interference, and changing first the Republican platform and then US policy to serve Putin’s agendas. This included cutting support for Ukraine against Russia out of the Republican platform when he won the primary, considerable animosity toward Nato, and ultimately trying to blackmail Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019 by withholding military aid while demanding he offer confirmation of a Russian conspiracy theory blaming Ukraine rather than Russia for 2016 election interference. A stunning number of Trump’s closest associates had deep ties to the Russian government. They included Paul Manafort, who during his years in Ukraine worked to build Russian influence there and served as a consultant to the Kremlin-backed Ukrainian president who was driven out of the country – and into Russia by popular protest in 2014 (the Russian line is that this was an illegitimate coup and thus a justification for invasion is still widely repeated). Manafort was, during his time in the campaign, sharing data with Russian intelligence agent Konstantin V Kilimnik, while campaign advisor Jeff Sessions was sharing information with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Manafort, Donald Trump Jr and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner held an illegal meeting in Trump Tower with a Kremlin-linked lawyer on June 9, 2016, where they were promised damaging material on the Clinton campaign. After being seated next to Putin while being paid to speak at a dinner celebrating RT, Russia’s news propaganda outlet, Michael Flynn briefly became Trump’s national security advisor. He was soon was fired for lying to White House officials and later pled guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Jared Kushner allegedly directed him to make those contacts and as the Washington Post reported in May 2017, “Jared Kushner and Russia’s ambassador to Washington discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between Trump’s transition team and the Kremlin, using Russian diplomatic facilities in an apparent move to shield their pre-inauguration discussions from monitoring.” The Guardian reported the same year that “Donald Trump Jr has been forced to release damning emails that reveal he eagerly embraced what he was told was a Russian government attempt to damage Hillary Clinton’s election campaign.” What’s striking in retrospect is that all of this was made possible by corruption and amorality inside the United States. It was Silicon Valley’s mercenary amorality that created weapons and vulnerabilities and sat by pocketing the profit as they were exploited to destructive ends. It was corrupt Americans – from Manafort to Trump himself – that gave Putin his influence. It was international players such as Wikileaks and Cambridge Analytica that helped. It was corruption of media outlets such as Fox News that continued – in Tucker Carlson’s case until last week’s invasion of Ukraine caught up with him – to defend Putin and spread disinformation. The Republican party met its new leader by matching his corruption, and by covering up his crimes and protecting him from consequences, including two impeachments. The second impeachment was for a violent invasion of Congress, not by a foreign power, but by right-wingers inflamed by lies instigated by Trump and amplified by many in the party. They have become willing collaborators in an attempt to sabotage free and fair elections, the rule of law, and truth itself. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

3/2/2022,"Good morning. Joe Biden announced last night that the US was banning Russian aircraft from its airspace and promised to go after Russian oligarchs in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine. In his State of the Union address, Biden said this would further isolate Vladimir Putin. The announcements are the latest in a series of sanctions against Russia and come after similar actions by Canada and the EU this week. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s besieged cities have come under more heavy bombardment after Russian commanders facing fierce resistance intensified their shelling of urban areas. Ukrainian security heads said this morning that Russian paratroopers had landed in Kharkiv and engaged in heavy fighting with Ukrainian forces. What do we know on day seven of Russia’s invasion? Several cities are under heavy bombardment again and thousands of Ukrainians are trying to leave Kyiv, our correspondent in Kyiv reported, as Russia’s defence ministry warned it plans to strike targets there. Here’s everything we know so far. What else is happening? Researchers are gathering mounting evidence that the Russian military is committing war crimes with deadly attacks on civilians and the use of cluster munitions. In his address, traditionally one of the most widely viewed speeches a president makes, Joe Biden sought to assure Americans demoralized after two years of a global pandemic that transformed American life, and, now, rattled by a land war in Europe. “I want you to know that we are going to be OK,” the president said. “Last year Covid-19 kept us apart,” Biden said, surveying the chamber filled with lawmakers, cabinet officials and the justices of the supreme court as he opened his prime-time address. “This year we are finally together again.” It was the war in Ukraine, however, that brought rare bipartisanship to the house chamber, where members of both parties rose to applaud Biden when he disparaged Putin. Hailing the “fearlessness” and the “iron will” of the Ukrainian people, Biden introduced the visibly emotional Ukrainian ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova. He asked the chamber to stand with him and send an “unmistakable signal”, a message of solidarity with the Ukrainian people. What else did he talk about? Biden outlined a “unity agenda” that he said could find bipartisan support. The list included combatting the opioid epidemic, expanding mental health resources, supporting US veterans and supercharging the “moonshot” effort to fight cancer. Was it a speech for the ages, with a ringing phrase that will define this moment of global peril? Perhaps not, writes David Smith. But it will have made millions of people in America and around the world grateful that the man at the podium was not Donald Trump. A bill to enshrine the right to abortion in federal law was blocked by Senate Republicans yesterday. Although Democrats expected it to fail, they brought the measure forward at a perilous moment for abortion rights, to ensure votes were recorded. The supreme court is expected in June to decide a Mississippi case that could severely curtail or damage abortion rights nationally. Yesterday, Democrats were 14 votes shy of the 60 needed to bring the bill to the floor for debate. Manchin, of West Virginia, was the only Democrat to join Republicans. “Abortion is a fundamental right and women’s decisions over women’s healthcare belong to women, not to extremist rightwing legislators,” the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, told reporters. What would the bill have meant if it had passed? The bill brought before the Senate, the Women’s Health Protection Act, would codify the rights provided by Roe in federal law. Last September, it was passed by the Democrat-controlled house. Astronomers who thought they had discovered a black hole on our cosmic doorstep have said they were mistaken, instead revealing they have found a two-star system involving a stellar “vampire”. At just 1,000 light years from Earth, it was thought to be the closest yet found to our planet. Texas voters went to the polls on Tuesday in the first primary contest of the US 2022 midterm elections. The state attorney general, Ken Paxton, a staunch Trump ally who has the former president’s endorsement, is seeking the Republican nomination for a third term. The house select committee investigating the 6 January Capitol attack has issued new subpoenas to lawyers for Trump suspected to be involved in efforts to stop the certification of Biden’s 2020 election victory. As fighting continues in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, people have been fleeing to neighbouring countries. But people in Lithuania, Slovakia, Latvia, Estonia, Romania and Poland fear Nato membership may not stop Russia invading them next. A Colombian conservationist who saved a rare species of parrot from extinction, a young feminist activist in Afghanistan, and two poets in Myanmar who used words to protest against the military coup, were among 358 human rights defenders murdered in 35 countries last year, analysis has found. Many of the killings could have been prevented, as they were preceded by threats and calls for protection, according to FLD, which tries to protect activists at risk. In 1970, Michael Brody Jr announced he would give away $25m, inspiring hundreds of thousands of letters. But, as a new documentary shows, the story took an unlikely turn. The director Keith Maitland and the veteran film producer Ed Pressman have centred their new documentary, Dear Mr Brody, on a trove of unread letters that came into Pressman’s possession. “Each letter is a life,” the producer said. “Opening them is like peeking behind a curtain into somebody’s private story,” Maitland added. My Ticket to Ride is far from the only Beatles book released last year. But Janice Mitchell’s memoir is one of the few Beatles books written by a woman in the 60 years since they released their debut single. The Beatles have profoundly shaped and enriched the lives of women, but the literature, journalism and critical scholarship – with a few notable exceptions – tends to focus disproportionately on how men experience and appreciate the band and its music.

3/2/2022,"There’s always something a bit grim about the State of the Union. A setpiece of American political theater, the annual speech by the president to a joint session of Congress is choreographed to eliminate any chance of accidental sincerity. The president speaks in carefully calibrated spin; every word sounds like it has been focus-grouped. Members of the opposition party make a show of their animosity, vamping for the cameras with either staid, dignified displeasure or ravenous hatred, depending on where they are running for re-election. No one’s mind is changed and little new information is delivered. By its nature, the speech is meant to describe the status quo. It is not meant to change it. This year, President Biden had a particularly grim task. After months and months of negotiations with Senator Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, proved fruitless, his sweeping economic agenda, the Build Back Better Plan, appears to be dead. The two major voting rights bills that would have helped secure the franchise for Black Americans and protect the integrity of future elections were killed when Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema, of Arizona, declined to support an exemption to the filibuster, meaning that the erosion of voting rights in Republican-controlled states is likely to advance unchallenged. Many economic indicators are strong, but with inflation running rampant, this means little to working families, who see their paychecks covering less and less of what they need. This spring, the US supreme court will hand down opinions that will drastically reshape American government and American lives, including the case from Mississippi, Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health, that will overturn Roe v Wade. The midterms are coming, and in Europe, a pointless and brutal war of self-aggrandizement has been launched by an erratic and mendacious dictator with a massive stockpile of nuclear weapons. Perhaps it was to be expected, then, that Biden’s speech was wide-ranging in tone, frenziedly ambitious in its agenda, and light on specifics. He opened with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, condemning the murderous ambitious of Vladimir Putin and praising the courage of the unexpectedly resilient Ukrainian military and civilian volunteer forces to rapturous applause. The Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, was in attendance as a guest of the first lady, and she received the night’s first standing ovation, her hand placed over her heart from her balcony seat, as lawmakers below fluttered her country’s blue and yellow flag. Homages to the Ukrainian struggle were everywhere in the House chamber, with a number of women lawmakers dressed in blue and yellow ensembles, men and women alike wearing stickers of the Ukrainian flag on their lapels, and others fielding subtler signals of solidarity: when the camera lingered on Senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, she had a cloth sunflower, the Ukrainian national symbol, pinned to her collar. Biden boasted of the devastating impact of western economic sanctions on the Russian economy, reaffirmed his support for Nato, and vowed to deploy the justice department to seize yachts belonging to Putin’s friends. Promisingly, it seems as if concerns over growing Russian aggression might spark a renewed interest in energy independence that could help America and Europe break their addiction to Russian oil and gas. Speaking of the recent return of significant numbers of American troops to Central Europe for the first time in years, Biden reaffirmed his commitment to preventing a direct military confrontation with Russia, and emphasized that the troops would be there not to attack the Russians, but to protect Nato allies. One suspects that Putin will not appreciate the distinction. When Biden moved on to domestic policy, the crowd quickly became divided. As he touted his American Rescue Plan, last year’s Covid relief package, boos erupted from the Republican side when Biden noted that the 2017 Republican tax cuts had primarily benefitted the very rich. It was a theme he maintained as he turned to his bipartisan infrastructure law, the $1tn legislative achievement that provides funds for the maintenance and repair of the nation’s physical infrastructure – roads, bridges, airports, commuter trains, and internet. Biden touted a serious of shovel-ready projects he claims will go into effect this year and emphasized the bill’s ability to encourage the return of the American manufacturing sector. Domestic manufacturing was largely his prescription for fighting inflation, too. Biden introduced his broader economic agenda with a call to make more stuff in the US, and to use the federal government’s purchasing power to support those American-made goods. This segue led into a litany of briefly visited agenda items, such as allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices; cutting the cost of childcare for working class families so that more women could return to the paid workforce; establishing a 15% minimum corporate tax rate; and supporting the labor-strengthening Pro Act. Many of these proposals seemed less like Biden was putting forward achievable goals for the next year of his presidency and more like he was shifting through the wreckage of his disastrous Build Back Better negotiations with Manchin, searching for some workable leftovers. Many of the items he proposed had already been presented to Congress; none of them had been able to get through the obstructionism of the Republican party and the Manchin-Sinema block. These things would substantially improve the lives of Americans, but it was clear he had no plan for how to implement any of them. This was true especially for abortion rights. Though reproductive choice advocates had long urged Biden to say the word “abortion” in public – he has never done so as president – he referred tonight only offhandedly to the importance of reproductive rights. There was no mention of the fact that Roe v Wade has been nullified in the state of Texas for six months, as of Tuesday. There was no mention of the fact that the Reproductive Health Act, an attempt to legislatively secure the federal right to an abortion, failed in the Senate this week. There was no mention of the fact that of the five supreme court justices present at the speech, three of them – John Roberts, Brett Kavanagh, and Amy Coney Barrett – will vote to eliminate that right in a few short months. “We have to protect a woman’s right to choose,” said Biden, not offering any ideas as to just how that right might be protected. The camera cut momentarily to Amy Coney Barrett, who pursed her lips as thin as paper. In this way, the speech was a perfect summation of Biden’s presidency: good intentions, with only halting, sporadic, uncreative, and trepidatious pursuit of actually enacting them. Unlike his predecessor, Biden tends to stay on script, but the State of the Union speech featured several ad libs – a product, some suspected, of the multiple revisions the speech was subjected to at the last minute, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine placed new demands on the broadcast. The last of this was probably the most apropos: “Go get him,” Biden told the nation. Him who? Get him how? It didn’t make sense, but so little of this does.

3/2/2022,"Phoebe Garrett has attended university lectures without catching Covid; she even hosted a party where everyone subsequently tested positive except her. “I think I’ve knowingly been exposed about four times,” the 22-year-old from High Wycombe said. In March 2021, she participated in the world’s first Covid-19 challenge trial, which involved dripping live virus into her nose and pegging her nostrils shut for several hours, in a deliberate effort to infect her. Still her body resisted. “We had multiple rounds of tests, and different methods of testing: throat swabs, nose swabs, other types of swabs that I’d never done before like nasal wicks – where you hold a swab in your nose for a minute – as well as blood tests, but I never developed symptoms, never tested positive,” Garrett said. “My mum has always said that our family never gets flu, and I’ve wondered if there’s maybe something behind that.” Most people know someone who has stubbornly resisted catching Covid, despite everyone around them falling sick. Precisely how they do this remains a mystery, but scientists are beginning to find some clues. The hope is that identifying these mechanisms could lead to the development of drugs that not only protect people from catching Covid, but also prevent them from passing it on. Garrett isn’t the only challenge trial participant to have avoided becoming infected. Of the 34 who were exposed to the virus, 16 failed to develop an infection (defined as two consecutive positive PCR tests) – although around half of them transiently tested positive for low levels of the virus, often several days after exposure. Possibly, this was a reflection of the immune system rapidly shutting down an embryonic infection. “In our previous studies with other viruses, we have seen early immune responses in the nose that are associated with resisting infection,” said Prof Christopher Chiu at Imperial College London, who led the study. “Together, these findings imply that there is a struggle between the virus and host, which in our ‘uninfected’ participants results in prevention of infection taking off. Some of them also reported some mild symptoms, such as a stuffy nose, sore throat, tiredness, or headache – although, since these commonly occur in everyday life, they may have been unrelated to virus exposure. “Either way, levels of the virus didn’t climb high enough to trigger detectable levels of antibodies, T cells or inflammatory factors in the blood that are usually associated with symptoms,” Chiu said. Other studies also suggest it is possible to shake off Covid during the earliest stages of infection, before it establishes a proper foothold. For instance, during the first wave of the pandemic, Dr Leo Swadling at University College London and colleagues intensively monitored a group of healthcare workers who were regularly exposed to infected patients, but who never tested positive or developed antibodies themselves. Blood tests revealed that around 15% of them had T cells reactive against Sars-CoV-2, plus other markers of viral infection. Possibly, memory T-cells from previous coronavirus infections – ie those responsible for common colds – cross-reacted with the new coronavirus and protected them from Covid. Understanding how frequently people abort nascent Covid infections in the era of Omicron is complicated because it requires intensive testing – for the virus, antibodies, T cells and other markers of infection – and because so many people have now been vaccinated. “It is likely vaccinated individuals are exposed to the virus, and block viral replication and detectable infection more commonly,” Swadling said. There is also no commercially available test that can distinguish between immunity triggered by vaccination and the different variants – so unless you’ve recently tested positive, it’s almost impossible to know if you’ve been exposed to Omicron or not. Seasonal coronaviruses may not be the only source of cross-protective immune responses. Prof Cecilia Söderberg-Nauclér, an immunologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, began investigating this possibility, after Sweden avoided being overwhelmed by cases during the pandemic’s first wave, despite its light-touch approach to restrictions. Mathematical modelling by her colleague, Marcus Carlsson at Lund University, suggested this pattern of infections could only be explained if a large proportion of people had some kind of protective immunity. Her team scoured databases of protein sequences from existing viruses, hunting for small segments (peptides) resembling those from the new coronavirus, to which antibodies were likely to bind. When they identified a six-amino acid peptide in a protein from H1N1 influenza, which matched a crucial part of the coronavirus spike protein, “I almost fell out of my chair,” Söderberg-Nauclér said. They have since discovered antibodies to this peptide in up to 68% of blood donors from Stockholm. The research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, could suggest that immune responses triggered by H1N1 influenza – which was responsible for the 2009-10 swine flu pandemic – and possibly related subsequent strains, may equip people with partial – though not complete – protection against Covid-19. “It provides a cushion, but it won’t protect you if an infected person coughs in your face,” Söderberg-Nauclér said. A small proportion of people may even be genetically resistant to Covid-19. In October, an international consortium of researchers launched a global hunt to find some of them, in the hope of identifying protective genes. “We are not looking for common gene variants that provide modest protection against infection, what we are looking for is potentially very rare gene variants that completely protect someone against infection,” said Prof András Spaan at The Rockefeller University in New York, who is leading the research. They are particularly interested in people who shared a home and bed with an infected person, and avoided infection themselves. “For instance, the other day I was talking to an elderly lady from the Netherlands, who took care of her husband during the first wave. The husband was eventually admitted to the ICU, but she spent the week before taking care of him, sharing the same room, and without access to face masks,” said Spaan. “We cannot explain why she did not get infected.” Such resistance is known to exist for other diseases, including HIV, malaria, and norovirus. In these cases, a genetic defect means some people lack a receptor used by the pathogen to enter cells, so they can’t be infected. “It could well be that, in some individuals, there is such a defect in a receptor used by Sars-CoV-2,” Spaan said. Identifying such genes could lead to the development of new treatments for Covid-19, in the same way that the identification of CCR5 receptor defects in HIV-resistant people has led to new ways of treating HIV. Spaan thinks it is unlikely that the majority of those who’ve avoided Covid are genetically resistant, even if they have some partial immune protection. This means there’s no guarantee they won’t eventually succumb to the infection – as Garrett found out in late January. Having dodged the virus for almost two years, she was shocked when a routine lateral flow test produced an ominous second red line in late January. Shortly afterwards, she developed mild Covid symptoms, but has since recovered. The irony is that, having avoided catching Covid from close family, friends, and in a specialist medical laboratory, it was probably a relative stranger who infected her. “I have no idea where I got it from; it could have been someone in my local choir, or maybe from the gym,” she said.",News/World news,Scientists seek to solve mystery of why some people do not catch Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/scientists-seek-to-solve-mystery-of-why-some-people-do-not-catch-covid
3/2/2022,"Shirley Hughes, who has died aged 94, was an award-winning author of more than 50 children’s books, and illustrator of some 200 more, with worldwide sales of more than 11m. She had an exceptional talent for drawing children. Through her warm-hearted observation, particularly of pre-school children, she created a distinctive and affectionate visual image of childhood that has been instantly recognisable for more than 60 years. In 1977 she published Dogger, one of her best-loved books, and the first to bring her a mass readership. It tells the story of a small boy called Dave, whose battered toy dog gets lost on the trip to pick up his sister, Bella, from school. After an anxious evening Dogger turns up on the toy stall at the school fair the next day, but Dave has no money to buy it. Disaster strikes when the beloved animal is sold to a little girl. But with the help of Bella, the drama is resolved and Dave and Dogger are reunited. The book won Hughes her first CILIP Kate Greenaway medal, and 30 years later Dogger was voted the “Greenaway of Greenaways” in a 2007 poll of the country’s favourite picture books. The appeal of Shirley’s books is obvious: her engaging characters have immediacy and vigour that come from her skilful and distinctive illustrations, using pen and ink, watercolour and gouache. She kept them up to date by being a passionate user of a sketchbook in which she made quick drawings – “almost at the speed of seeing” – capturing children and settings for her stories, from which she would then create characters who are attractively wholesome without being overly sentimental. Shirley’s ability to draw children was spotted by a children’s books editor while she was still a student at the Ruskin School of Drawing, Oxford. Initially, she mainly illustrated other people’s stories, starting with Noel Streatfeild’s The Bell Family in 1954, and including most notably Dorothy Edwards’s My Naughty Little Sister books when they were republished in the late 1960s. She also illustrated books by Alison Uttley, Ian Serraillier and Margaret Mahy. Shirley quickly moved on to writing and illustrating her own books. Lucy and Tom’s Day (1960) was the first of many that drew on the everyday experiences of her own young children for the kind of simple domestic incidents that would be familiar to many. She could create a sense of drama out of the smallest thing and resolve it without ever needing to deliver a message. Instead, she relied on children and their parents being largely sensible and so able to solve problems for themselves. In Alfie Gets in First (1981), the first of her celebrated Alfie series, the eponymous hero runs to be home first from a shopping trip and slams the door shut, inadvertently locking everyone else outside. He cannot reach the door catch and one neighbour after another gets involved in trying to help. There is no moralising about an unruly child or a careless mother: instead, Alfie works out a way to unlock the door and all is well again. Alfie starred in many subsequent stories, along with his little sister Annie Rose, including An Evening at Alfie’s, Alfie Gives a Hand and Alfie Wins a Prize. Their simple childhood adventures, set in a British urban world of birthday parties, park visits and local fairs, were fittingly modernised over the years and continued to delight generations of children and their parents, with the most recent book in the series, Alfie on Holiday, published in 2019. While the premise of many of Shirley’s books remained constant, she was innovative in the ways of telling them. A wordless picture book, Up and Up (1979), was followed by Chips and Jessie (1985), the first in a series of titles told in comic strip format as a way of helping emerging readers move from just pictures to words. Much later, she wrote fiction: The Lion and the Unicorn (2000), a short novel with many illustrations for six- to eight-year-olds, and two wartime adventures, Hero on a Bicycle (2012) and Whistling in the Dark (2016). In 2012 she published Dixie O’Day: In The Fast Lane!, the first in an illustrated series created jointly with her daughter, Clara Vulliamy. For her last book, written at the age of 92, she returned to the story of the lost toy dog with a seasonal sequel, Dogger’s Christmas, published in 2020. Shirley grew up in West Kirby, Wirral, the daughter of TJ Hughes, who owned the Liverpool department store of the same name, and his wife, Kathleen (nee Dowling); her father died when she was five, and Shirley was brought up by her mother. In a childhood with a lot of leisure time, she spent hours sketching, drawing and writing stories and plays with her two sisters. From early on, she was influenced by the illustrations of Arthur Rackham and William Heath Robinson and by comics, especially those from the US that the GIs left behind. After West Kirby high school for girls, which she left at 16, Shirley studied at Liverpool College of Art and, with an ambition to join the theatrical world, went to Birmingham Rep, where she made sets and designed costumes. She quickly decided that the theatre world was not for her but she found the experience provided a useful background to her later illustrative work. She then studied at the Ruskin in Oxford. According to her autobiography, A Life Drawing (2002), her application to Oxford was based on the misinformation that the city had an ice rink and she “rather fancied myself on ice”. At Ruskin, she studied life drawing, laying the foundation for so much of her later illustrations. Shirley was just the person that those who loved her illustrations would expect her to be. Usually in a hat, she was effortlessly elegant and graceful, and wonderful company: funny, insightful and kind with a laugh that was both loud and heartfelt. Her exceptional contribution to children’s books was widely recognised, with awards for individual titles including the Children’s Rights Workshop Other award, a prize that celebrated diversity in children’s books, for Helpers (1975); and a second Kate Greenaway medal, for Ella’s Big Chance (2003). She received the Eleanor Farjeon award for services to children’s literature in 1984, and was the first winner of the BookTrust lifetime achievement award, in 2015. She was appointed OBE in 1999 and CBE in 2017. In addition to her own work, Shirley battled hard for the cause of illustrators and authors, serving on the management committees of the Society of Authors, Public Lending Right and the Library and Information Services Council. In 1952 she married John Vulliamy; he died in 2007. She is survived by their three children, Ed, a journalist, Clara, an author and illustrator, and Tom, a research scientist.

3/2/2022,"Ryanair has pledged to be “the first airline to return to Ukraine” when it is safe to do so after the Russian invasion. Its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said Ryanair had been set to fly 2 million people to four airports in the country this year and had hoped to expand further before the invasion last week. He said he did not believe it would be possible to fly to Ukraine “for the foreseeable future, after Russia … essentially disabled a lot of the flight systems”. He added: “We will be the first airline to return to Ukraine when it is safe to do so … but I suspect it will take until next winter, when hopefully the Ukrainians will have seen off the Russians and sent them back to where they came from.” O’Leary said Ryanair was flying humanitarian cargo in the belly of its planes “for the first time in 30 years” to Polish airports, liaising with Ukrainian embassies. The airline has had a surge in bookings to Poland, where family members are flying to reunite with Ukrainian refugees close to the border. Wider flight bookings on Ryanair have otherwise dropped about 20% in the first days of the conflict, and are still around 10% down. O’Leary said he also expected massive demand for European beach destinations this summer. With long-haul flying more risky and expensive due to Covid and the Russian airspace ban alongside pent-up demand from those who holidayed at home during the pandemic, millions could be competing for hotels and flights on short-haul routes. “If you holidayed in Bognor Regis or Scotland or the west of Ireland last summer, in a caravan in the gales and the rain, you are going [abroad]”, he said. Peak summer fares were likely to be 10-15% more expensive than pre-Covid, he predicted, advising early booking. The airline is set to expand strongly in the UK, growing strongly at London Stansted in particular, with 14 new routes expected to drive traffic above pre-Covid levels. Ryanair would be set to overtake easyJet as the UK’s biggest carrier at some point in 2022, O’Leary claimed. He said Ryanair would also benefit from its “somewhat fortuitous fuel-hedging strategy”, with 80% of its jet fuel requirements hedged at $65 dollars a barrel until March 2023. However, the high price of oil for the remaining 20% would still make a dent of around €50m in the airline’s balance sheet next year, he predicted.",News/Business,"Ryanair will be ‘first airline to return to Ukraine’, says CEO ",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/02/ryanair-will-be-first-airline-to-return-to-ukraine-says-ceo
3/2/2022,"It is not the place for cryptocurrency exchanges to block transactions by Russian users, the founder of one of the largest trading platforms has said, amid concern that digital currencies will be used to bypass sanctions. The chief executive and founder of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, said the company was “not in a position to sanction, like, populations of people”. “There are a few hundred individuals that are on the international sanctions list in Russia, mostly politicians, and we follow that very, very strictly,” Zhao told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We differentiate between the Russian politicians who start wars and the normal people, many normal Russians do not agree with war.” He added: “We are not political, we are against war, but we are here to help the people.” Cryptocurrency exchanges – which enable the trade of digital currencies including bitcoin and ethereum – and have been coming under pressure to comply with western sanctions, by blocking transactions with Russia, amid fears that crypto could allow the Kremlin to bypass restrictions designed to cut it off from the international banking system. The UK, EU, US and Canada moved at the weekend to expel Russian banks from Swift, the main global payments messaging system used by banks, and have also sought to prevent Russia’s central bank from using its foreign currency reserves. Some now fear that the Russian government and its banks could aim to use crypto as a backdoor, as an alternative measure of international exchange to the dollar. Zhao, known as “CZ”, said he did not know how many of the platform’s accounts had been frozen as a result of links with Russia but insisted that Binance knows its customers and would not allow sanctioned individuals to use its services. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister has called on crypto exchanges to block the addresses of all Russian users, a plea which has so far been resisted by the largest exchanges including Binance and Nasdaq-listed Coinbase. “The right level of sanctions is not a debate with us. We don’t make sanction lists,” Zhao said. “There are tens of thousands of exchanges globally. Many of them are very small, many of them are less secure. Many of them are less compliant. We don’t control the industry. I can publish my sanction list, you can publish yours, guess what? No one else is going to follow it. It just moves Russian users to other smaller platforms.” Zhao said he did not believe that cryptocurrencies – which are held on a decentralised ledger – would enable people to dodge sanctions. “If people want to evade sanctions, there’s always multiple methods. You can avoid sanctions using US dollars, using cash, using diamonds, using gold. I don’t think crypto is anything special there.” Zhao, whose personal wealth has been estimated at $1.9bn (£1bn) by Forbes magazine’s billionaires list, said Binance had donated $10m to aid the humanitarian effort in Ukraine and help those fleeing the conflict.",News/Technology,Crypto exchange boss resists calls for ban on all Russia transactions ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/02/crypto-exchange-boss-changpeng-zhao-binance-resists-calls-for-ban-on-all-russia-transactions
