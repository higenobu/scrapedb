5/1/2022,"By Jonathan Stempel and Carolina Mandl OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) -Warren Buffett on Saturday railed against Wall Street excess, and after spending tens of billions on stocks and companies in March extolled the virtue of keeping lots of cash, as he hosted Berkshire Hathaway Inc's first in-person annual meeting since 2019. Buffett, 91, who is Berkshire's chairman and chief executive, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 98, fielded questions in a downtown arena in Omaha, Nebraska. Vice Chairmen Greg Abel, Buffett's designated successor as CEO, and Ajit Jain also joined them. The meeting came after Berkshire revealed it had scooped up more than $51 billion of stocks in the first quarter, including a much larger stake in Chevron Corp, and has for now stopped repurchasing its own stock. Berkshire also said operating profit was little changed in the first quarter, as many businesses were able to boost revenue despite supply chain disruptions caused by the Omicron variant of COVID-19 and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 'I THINK WE'RE SANE' Buffett had in his annual shareholder letter in February bemoaned the lack of investment opportunities. That prompted a shareholder to ask what changed in March, when Berkshire bought 14.6% of Occidental Petroleum Corp and agreed to pay $11.6 billion for insurer Alleghany Corp. Buffett said it was simple: he became interested in Occidental after reading an analyst report, and in Alleghany after its chief executive wrote to him. ""Markets do crazy things, and occasionally Berkshire gets a chance to do something,"" he said. ""It's not because we're smart.... I think we're sane."" Berkshire's cash stake sank to around $106 billion from nearly $147 billion in the quarter, but Buffett said it was important to keep enough on hand. ""We will always have a lot of cash,"" he said. ""It's like oxygen, it's there all the time but if it disappears for a few minutes, it's all over."" Buffett also picked on a favored target, Wall Street, saying the stock market sometimes resembled a casino or gambling partner. ""That existed to an extraordinary degree in the last couple of years, encouraged by Wall Street,"" he said. Abel defended Berkshire's BNSF railroad, saying there was ""more to be done"" to improve operations and customer service, while Jain said Geico had lost ground to rival insurer Progressive Corp on telematics, which insurers use to track driver behavior and better match rates and risk. EARLY WAKE-UPS Hours before doors opened at 7 a.m. CDT (1200 GMT), thousands of people began massing outside the arena. Berkshire had projected lower attendance than in 2019, when it last held an in-person annual meeting, and about 10% to 15% of seats in the normally-full arena were empty. ""I bought a chair from Walmart so I could sit down,"" said Tom Spain, founder of Henry Spain Investment Services in Market Harborough, England, who arrived at 3:15 a.m. CDT to attend his third meeting. ""Everyone has been using it. Next year I might bring a massive container of coffee and give it out."" Lauritz Fenselau, a 23-year-old owner of a software startup from Frankfurt, Germany, showed up at 4 a.m. CDT for his first meeting. ""Warren and Charlie are the priests. It's like a pilgrimage,"" he said. ""I took three flights and 16 hours to get here, so I wanted to be here early."" Andres Avila from Boston, a huge fan of Buffett, arrived in Omaha just five hours before getting in line at 4:45 a.m. ""I said: I'm already doing the trip for this. I just might as well get the best seat I can"", said Avila, carrying an umbrella to fend off the rain. ""I have a bunch of my idols here."" Shareholders will vote later on whether Berkshire should replace Buffett with an independent chair--he would remain chief executive--and disclose how its dozens of businesses promote diversity and address climate risks and mitigation. Berkshire's board opposes the proposals. The meeting is being broadcast online at cnbc.com https://www.cnbc.com/brklive22.

5/1/2022,"A post-earnings plunge in Amazon's stock isn't shaking the confidence of Wall Street, which is staying largely upbeat on a view the company's fundamentals will sharply improve later this year and into 2023. ""Amazon's Q1 results and Q2 guidance were disappointing (sales and operating income) but don’t necessarily change the story, which is that growth should inflect in Q3 and set up for a stronger FY23,"" Guggenheim analyst Seth Sigman said. ""Amazon has gone through a major investment cycle, but some unique external factors (COVID, its related effects on labor, inflation, and the company's significant outperformance early in the pandemic) have pushed out the harvesting period that tends to follow. Ultimately, we see those investments, including in supply chain capacity and people, supporting stronger market share gains and helping Amazon navigate the uncertain macro cycle ahead."" The analyst reiterated a buy rating on Amazon's stock. But as Sigman's noted, Amazon's first quarter and guidance left much to be desired. The company said late Thursday that first quarter profits were by a $6 billion hit from supply chain inefficiencies and general inflation. Amazon's sale increase of 7% in the quarter, compared to a 44% rise in the same period last year, marking the company's slowest growth rate in more than two decades. Here is how Amazon performed versus Wall Street estimates: Net Sales: $116.4 billion vs. $116.43 billion expected Diluted EPS: -$7.56 per share vs. $8.40 per share expected Amazon outlined a potential $4 billion hit to profits in the second quarter from the same factors, and promised to bring spending more in line with sales trends into the back half of the year. The confluence of negative factors to the earnings release hammered Amazon's stock. Amazon stock crashed 14% on Friday, the steepest one-day drop since 2006. Sigman was joined in his optimism by Cowen analyst John Blackledge. ""There were bright spots in the quarter,"" Blackledge said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""They did say delivery speeds are kind of right there they were just before the start of the pandemic. So they will start to crank up one day and same day. Usually when you put a faster delivery speed on a product it drives higher purchase conversion, and so you are going to get that as we round through into next year. That coupled with easier comparisons as we get to the back half of the year, it's a good setup for the top line. The historic investment cycle is coming to a close. So you should have margin upside in the back half of the year and as we get into next year,"" Blackledge reiterated an out-perform on Amazon as well.
