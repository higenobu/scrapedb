3/20/2022,"Russia has rubbished reports suggesting its cosmonauts wore yellow suits with blue accents to show solidarity with Ukraine. The three cosmonauts wore the suits, bearing the colours of the Ukrainian flag, when arriving at the International Space Station (ISS), leading to speculation they were a show of support for the country Russia is attacking. However, on Saturday, Russia dismissed the idea as fanciful. The cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev said each crew picked the colours about six months before launch because the suits needed to be individually sewn. He added that they were chosen because all three graduated from Bauman Moscow State Technical University and so they chose the colours of their prestigious alma mater. In a statement on the Russian space agency’s Telegram channel, Artemyev said: “There is no need to look for any hidden signs or symbols in our uniform. A colour is simply a colour. It is not in any way connected to Ukraine. Otherwise, we would have to recognise its rights to the yellow sun in the blue sky. “These days, even though we are in space, we are together with our president and our people.” Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the space agency Roscosmos, tweeted a picture of the university’s blue and gold coat of arms. Иногда желтый цвет означает просто желтый цвет. Если бандеровские выродки думают, что мы из-за них поменяем наши цветовые вкусы, перекрасим стартовый комплекс Восточного в серо-буро-малиновый, герб МГТУ Баумана в оранжевый (нет, оранжевый тоже не подходит),.. pic.twitter.com/7qFDtu11Dl Shortly after their arrival at the orbiting station on Friday, Artemyev had a different answer about the flight suits, saying there was a lot of the yellow material in storage and “that’s why we had to wear yellow”. The Nasa administrator, Bill Nelson, has played down hostile comments by Rogozin in the wake of the invasion, after Russia said it would stop supplying rocket engines to US companies. “That’s just Dmitry Rogozin,” Nelson told Associated Press. “He spouts off every now and then. But at the end of the day, he’s worked with us.” The Russian invasion has resulted in cancelled launches and broken contracts. Many worry Rogozin is putting decades of work at risk, most notably regarding the ISS. Besides threatening to pull out of the space station and drop it on the US, Europe or elsewhere, Rogozin had the flags of other countries covered on a Soyuz rocket awaiting liftoff with internet satellites. The launch was called off after the customer, London-based OneWeb, refused Rogozin’s demand that the satellites not be used for military purposes and the British government halt financial backing. On Thursday, the European Space Agency confirmed that it was indefinitely suspending its ExoMars rover mission with Roscosmos because of the war in Ukraine. “Despite all of that, up in space, we can have a cooperation with our Russian friends, our colleagues,” Nelson said. “The professional relationship between astronauts and cosmonauts, it hasn’t missed a beat. This is the cooperation we have going on in the civilian space programme.” The US and Russia are the prime operators of the space station, which has been occupied for 21 years. Nasa has said the US astronaut Mark Vande Hei’s plans remained unchanged, despite a video in early March allegedly produced by Roscosmos that showed two Russian cosmonauts waving him goodbye. It then showed a mission control team watching a computer-generated video of the Russian segment of the station detaching and floating away. The video, which included a Russian song titled Farewell, was shared by the news agency RIA Novosti. Its caption read: “The Roscosmos television studio jokingly demonstrated the possibility of Russia withdrawing from the ISS project – the undocking of the Russian segment of the station, without which the American part of the project cannot exist.” In a response, the Russian state news agency Tass said: “American astronaut Mark Vande Hei will return to Earth on 30 March onboard the Russian Soyuz MS-19 spacecraft, together with Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov … Roscosmos has never given reason to doubt its reliability as a partner.” Associated Press contributed to this report",News/World news,Russia denies ISS cosmonauts wore yellow and blue suits to support Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/russia-denies-iss-cosmonauts-wore-yellow-and-blue-suits-to-support-ukraine
3/20/2022,"In the 1970s, Lucinda Childs was part of New York’s downtown arts scene, reacting against balletic and theatrical conventions to make minimalist dance built on simple movements and stark geometry. Now 81, she continues to create, but her dancer niece Ruth is reviving some of her early works and 50 years on they still challenge.Childs’ most famous work, Dance, was propelled by its Philip Glass score, but these works are all performed in silence, the dance providing its own form, logic and rhythm. Sometimes that rhythm is audible in the dancers’ footsteps. In Calico ingling (1973), the pad of four pairs of white trainers across the floor: “One, two, three, four, five, six ...” arms loosely swinging as the women trace circles and semicircles across the space like a Spirograph. Or the “one and a two ...” of Ruth’s feet in Katema (1978), as she shifts backwards and forwards along the same diagonal line, accented with sharp exhalations. The simplicity of the result belies the immense control it must take to perform, the focus and stamina required to stay so measured. It’s very satisfying to witness.1975’s Reclining Rondo takes place on the floor, its movements – slide, turn, lie, rouch – still rhythmical but soundless. Gone is the reassuring pulse, the tempo reduced to about 20 bpm. A repeated phrase begins in unison, until subtle quarter-turn shifts spark reconfiguration. It’s like setting up the parameters of a computer code and letting the sequence play out.There is absolute evenness of tone, no “performance”, no expression of face or feeling, soft bodies executing mechanical function. Performed in daylight, surrounded by audience on four sides, it’s not the kind of dance that offers an escape; nor does it reward 21st-century brains seeking dopamine spikes. But it does heighten your awareness of your own body sitting there, and reveal shape and pattern, even time – in the solo Particular Reel (1973) Ruth moves methodically up and down the room from one end to the other and we can visualise the minutes ahead.

3/20/2022,"Addressing the crowds at a public rally in Punjab last week, Pakistan’s prime minister was on the attack. Western leaders, Imran Khan said, treated Pakistan as their “slave” and presumed that “whatever you say, we will do”. Days before, it had been announced that Khan would be facing a vote of no confidence in parliament at the end of March, after more than 100 members of Pakistan’s united opposition successfully tabled a motion to oust him. The vote will take place on Friday 25 March. The prime minister’s opponents, who have put aside their own differences to unite in an anti-Khan coalition, have accused him of bad governance and economic incompetence as inflation has soared and Khan has appeared to lose the backing of the military establishment credited with bringing him to power in the first place. As he fights for his political life, however, Khan has turned to a strategy he hopes will win him support, even as his government’s popularity is nosediving: brazen bashing of the west. He was particularly scathing of a recent request by diplomats of 22 countries, including EU member states, who jointly called on Pakistan to support a resolution in the United Nations general assembly condemning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. Khan, who has been trying to cultivate a closer relationship with Russia in defiance of the west and was in Moscow on the day of the invasion – saying it was an “exciting time” to be there – point-blank refused, expressing only “concern” at the situation. According to a narrative being pushed by Khan and ministers close to him, the vote of no confidence is part of a conspiracy by foreign powers in the west, and even the CIA, to topple his government, which is no longer willing to support the actions of the west and Nato as they did during the “war on terror”. This week, Pakistan’s human rights minister, Shireen Mazari, tweeted, and then deleted, a message accusing the opposition of using “external powers for their devious games”. On Monday, the foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, told a press conference he had intelligence that the vote of no confidence against Khan was happening at the behest of western powers. “I have more information than this,” Qureshi said cagily, adding that he would only reveal it once he had the green light from the prime minister. Michael Kugelman, the deputy director of the Asia programme and senior associate for south Asia at the Wilson Centre, said it made “good political sense for Khan to ramp up the anti-west rhetoric”, which would be likely to fire up his support base, who are widely mistrustful of the west, particularly the US, after the heavy price paid by Pakistan during the “war on terror” and amid increasingly hostile US-Pakistan relations. “If he loses power, he can blame the west and use that as a rallying cry to draw support to prepare for a fresh bid at power,” said Kugelman. “And if he stays in power, he can boast that he defied the west’s efforts to undermine him and use that as momentum to push toward getting elected to a second term.” Khan’s anti-western rhetoric has also been taken as a sign of the prime minister’s concerns that the vote of no confidence poses a real threat to his ability to stay in power and become the first prime minister in Pakistan to complete a full term in office. Pakistan’s powerful military, which retains a large amount of power and influence even in a civilian government, is considered by many as largely responsible for Khan’s election win in 2018, though they have denied any involvement. In recent months, however, there has been an apparent widening gap between Khan and the military establishment and it is thought that he will no longer be able to rely on their backing behind the scenes in the vote of no confidence. An armed forces spokesperson distanced the military from the vote entirely, saying: “I have said it earlier that the army has nothing to do with politics. It is better for all of us to avoid unnecessary speculation on this matter.” While Khan currently has a majority in parliament with his coalition partners, the opposition claims that it has the backing of at least 20 lawmakers from the ruling party and its allies. That would be enough to lose Khan the vote, currently scheduled for 25 March. Even allies of Khan’s have admitted he could be facing defeat. Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry told a news conference that they rejected “this culture of turncoats”. “We are clear that we will not get into any blackmailing to save our government,” said Chaudhry. Chaudhry Pervez Elahi, the speaker of Punjab’s assembly, who is close to Khan, said: “The united opposition has more numbers than needed. Many surprises will come in the coming days.” Aasim Sajjad Akthar, an author and associate professor of political economy at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad, said it was no surprise in this moment of political strife that Khan was leaning on anti-western tropes, and in particular the narrative that western civilisation poses a direct threat to Islam. “Having said this, it is nevertheless a fact that Pakistan’s political and economic history has been shaped by western imperialist powers,” said Akthar. “Whether there is any direct intervention by western governments to ease Imran Khan out of power is something we will know for sure only in the due course of time.”",News/World news,Pakistani PM steps up criticism of west as confidence vote looms,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/pakistan-imran-khan-criticism-west-confidence-vote
3/20/2022,"This is a touching if a tad treacly portrait of Ady Barkan, an inspiring American activist who has the terminal neurodegenerative disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis AKA motor neurone disease). Filmed over several years and directed by Nicholas Bruckman, it starts with Barkan, originally a lawyer, already well into his career as a protester and campaigner, particularly on issues that affect people on low incomes. When first met he seems like a loving family man, devoted to his wife Rachael, an academic, and their adorable baby son Carl. But then he’s diagnosed with ALS, and naturally everything changes. The film includes a tearful, wrenching clip he shot himself in the middle of the night after he found out and couldn’t sleep for worry. His health seems to deteriorate quickly – though perhaps that’s partly an effect of the cinematic compression of time. Even so, as the indominable little Carl gets bigger and stronger and the Trump administration wreaks more and more havoc on the nation and the world, Barkan gradually loses the ability to walk, talk or even breathe by himself. Amazingly, that doesn’t stop him from campaigning; he shifts his focus on to the threats to public healthcare and provision for people with pre-existing conditions like himself. In a famous viral clip filmed by friend and fellow activist Elizabeth Jaff, he debates the issue with Republican senator Jeff Flake on a plane. Although he doesn’t manage to persuade Flake to change his vote, the encounter triggered Barkan’s Be a Hero campaign which seeks, in addition to advocating for various progressive issues, to influence potentially persuadable Republicans such as Susan Collins to vote against, say, Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the supreme court. The struggle ends up cornering Flake in another confrontation, this time involving Ana Maria Archila in an elevator, cheered on by Barkan. Smart, funny and endearingly sweary even when he loses the power to speak without computer assistance, Barkan is a charismatic character who’s easy to like, although one wonders how much the documentary crew resisted showing anything that might dent the halo the film sets round his head. At one point, Barkan talks about his own feelings of guilt for being out on the road so much and missing his children’s early years (Rachael has a second child in due course); maybe it wouldn’t have hurt to probe further what price people like Barkan pay for their own heroism.

3/20/2022,"Just over two years ago, I sat up in bed and realised, with a sinking feeling, that we were at the beginning of five years of a Tory government. I reached for my sketchbook, drew a self-satisfied troll and felt marginally better. This became a habit. Now, each morning while listening to the Today programme on Radio 4, I pick up a pen and sketch a response to the news. These drawings are loose and scratchy, the compositions uncomplicated and direct, and they do not take long. Once I have completed these daily sketches, I post them on social media, where they join all those other messages in bottles bobbing along on the cybertides. Last year, in response to requests, I collected them all into a rather unwieldy volume that I titled Five Years… A Sketchbook of Political Drawings – Volume One 2020. The response was so encouraging that I decided to do it again a year later. So now Five Years… A Sketchbook of Political Drawings Volume Two – 2021 is piled high on my kitchen table, every bit as unwieldy as its predecessor. The year 2021 turned out to be a horrifying sequel to 2020 – a second instalment of the unprecedented events of the previous 12 months. In January, we watched agog as horned shamans and Confederate flag-wavers attacked the Capitol in Washington. In February, the Tory right clamoured for Covid restrictions to be relaxed as new variants arrived to shatter their maskless dreams. In March, Meghan and Prince Harry shared all with Oprah as his creepy uncle avoided helping US authorities with their inquiriesand David Cameron retreated to his shepherd’s hut as news of his corporate lobbying broke. In April, the Russian bear continued to soil the woods on the Ukrainian border (little did we know what was to come). In May, the Dominic Cummings-Boris Johnson feud reignited, and in June there were reports of Matt Hancock caught in a Covid-breaching clinch. In July, Johnson got pinged on the eve of his self-proclaimed “freedom day” in England, and in August, the Taliban plunged Afghanistan back into the dark ages while our holidaying foreign secretary found that “the sea was closed”. September saw the silly sausages of the Democratic Unionist party protesting against the Brexit they voted for and panic buying at petrol stations, and revealed a Brexit shortage of HGV drivers. In October, Johnson escaped to a Spanish villa for some pretend painting photo ops, and in November took a jet back from the Cop26 climate conference, where he had nodded off during a speech. Then in December, Omicron arrived just as rumours of last year’s Downing Street parties began to circulate. The year ended as it began, in turmoil, recriminations and a Covid Christmas. Recurring characters filled the pages as I sketched each day. There was that Russian bear, the furious silly sausage, long-suffering Britannia and her lion and, of course, our tousle-haired, pants-on-fire tinpot Churchill, in a ditch, naked as a newly clothed emperor, constructing champagne crate buses or cavorting in that hi-vis jacket. Johnson has danced through the sketchbooks of the last two years. As I continue drawing each day, I cannot help hoping that in 2023 the scandals will finally catch up with our glorious leader, but for now Sue Gray’s report is all but forgotten as the tragedy of Ukraine unfolds. It looks as if that Russian bear and its evil master will dominate the pages of volume three.

3/20/2022,"Carrie Johnson is a fascinating woman. An undoubtedly complex character, inspiring fierce loyalty from some and equally fierce loathing in others, she wields an influence unlike any previous British prime minister’s wife and arguably represents a new archetype of female power. But if Michael Ashcroft’s thoroughly unauthorised biography of her is to be believed, she only really got interesting when she met her husband. Her old headteacher reports that “she didn’t stand out” and there is little memorable to say about her student years. Politically, an early boyfriend describes a “fairly blank canvas”, who fell into working for the Tory MP Zac Goldsmith (her springboard to a press officer job at party headquarters and subsequent special adviser gig) largely because of a shared passion for animal welfare. The one character who really comes alive in the early chapters is her father, Matthew Symonds, co-founder of the Independent newspaper, accused of brandishing packets of condoms in morning conference – a way, one ex-colleague suggests, of letting everyone know that despite being married he was still having lots of sex – and trying to wangle his mistress Josephine McAffee a job on the paper. When Carrie was born as a result of this affair, he financially supported and spent time with his daughter, but didn’t leave his wife. Something here sounds uncannily familiar, but if there are intriguing parallels between the absent father and the married ex-journalist two decades her senior who Carrie eventually fell for, Ashcroft isn’t the writer to explore them. His real interest isn’t in making sense of her character but in how he thinks she shaped a Conservative government. Here the book appears to rely heavily on the accounts of her enemies, although in fairness, that may not be for want of trying to interview her friends (access to her inner circle is strictly controlled). Most readers are now familiar with the story of the power struggle inside Downing Street between a young, liberal clique loyal to Carrie and the former Vote Leave advisers Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain, which ended in victory for her. But Ashcroft helpfully traces these tensions back to their original roots, well before she entered No 10. In his telling, she first clashed with Cain when he was working for Johnson at the Foreign Office; she earned the now notorious nickname “Princess Nut Nut” for supposedly meddling in her lover’s run for the Tory leadership, and froze out his election guru Lynton Crosby during the 2019 election campaign. All these grievances were carried into power, with predictable consequences under pressure. There is an extraordinary bitterness to the extensive verbatim quotes, from heavily disguised anonymous sources, that follow. Carrie is portrayed as something of a spoiled princess, insecure and vengeful and lacking in “intellectual depth”. Worse, she has entrapped Boris in such an “emotionally disruptive relationship” that he seems actively scared of her. Similar claims have been aired before, not least by Cummings, but the charge here that there’s “something not right” about Carrie is a serious one. Yet it goes virtually unquestioned. Whoever his source is, Ashcroft apparently considers them beyond reproach. Carrie, we’re told, just isn’t up to the standards of the last wife; while Marina Wheeler organised his home life to perfection, Carrie is “demanding rather than supplying. I think it’s the biggest explanation of the dysfunctionality inside Number 10... Marina was his wife but she was also in some respects a mother figure to him.” This third marriage, our anonymous friend adds, is a “Greek tragedy” in which the great potential of a man we have just been told can’t manage his own laundry has been squandered “‘because of her”. The sexism rankles, obviously. But so does the way some big questions are left hanging. Is a man this chaotic actually capable of running a country? Was it really his wife’s job to organise him, or a chief of staff’s? Might the Downing Street operation take some responsibility itself for the chaos of the Downing Street operation? Yet the author largely contents himself with transcribing his mysterious but strangely familiar-sounding Deep Throat at length, before concluding gravely that while “I know that the buck stops with [Johnson], the evidence I have gathered suggests his wife’s behaviour is preventing him from leading Britain as effectively as the voters deserve”. Feminist qualms aside, the most puzzling thing about all this is the leap from the first half of the book to the second. Carrie Johnson is depicted as a kind of glittering she-devil, with a mystical hold over her husband and the skills to outwit veteran political campaigners. How Carrie Symonds, the unmemorable schoolgirl turned very middle-ranking special adviser, morphed suddenly into this creature of semi-mythical powers remains unclear. Should the book not seek to explain this, if only to avoid cynical readers concluding that it’s mostly another vehicle for the Vote Leave lot to work through their feelings about being dumped by Boris Johnson? Diana, Princess of Wales famously said that her marriage involved three people and so felt a bit crowded. With the Johnsons, it seems more like half an office-full. Maybe the real Carrie simply got lost in the crowd. First Lady: Intrigue at the Court of Carrie and Boris Johnson by Michael Aschroft is published by Biteback (£20).

3/20/2022,"Shipyard crane operator Maurice Flitcroft (Mark Rylance) is contemplating a career change. When he chances upon a game of golf while watching TV one evening, he’s launched into a new world. Literally. Director Craig Roberts plonks Flitcroft into a surreal dream sequence in which the character ascends an Astroturf staircase in his dressing gown and slippers. He’s flung around the world like a golf ball, dizzy with the sense of possibility. This whimsical comedy-drama tells the true story of Flitcroft, a daffy father of three, who blagged a spot in the 1976 Open championship, setting a new record for the tournament’s highest ever score. Roberts finds humour in golf’s topsy-turvy rules: the higher the score, the worse the game. The amateur player is a clear threat to anyone within hitting distance, but he also represents a challenge to the elitism of the sport. Undeterred by failure (and a lifetime ban), he re-enters under a fresh alias, donning a French accent and a moustache. “An open championship should be open to everyone,” says Flitcroft, who has his eyes on the competition’s £10,000 prize. Back in the day, he promised his wife, Jean (Sally Hawkins), champagne, caviar and diamonds. At the age of 46, he’s determined not to let her down. Isobel Waller-Bridge’s fizzy, hopeful score bolsters the optimistic mood. Despite the inherent silliness, the actors play it straight.

3/20/2022,"“Architecture’s role,” says Shelley McNamara of the Dublin-based Grafton Architects, “is to heighten where you are. It makes you more aware of the place you’re in.” It cannot, that is to say, cook a meal or mount a party or write a book, but it can profoundly affect your experience of eating or celebrating or studying. It cannot make a natural landscape or direct the course of the sun, but it can frame views or catch shadows in ways that make them more or less beautiful. Which is what McNamara, her business partner, Yvonne Farrell, and their practice have collectively done with the Marshall Building at the London School of Economics, a £145m project partly funded by the hedge fund manager Sir Paul Marshall. They have made a place for teaching and for study, for gathering, work, sport and music, as well as for passing through, thinking thoughts and doing nothing in particular, all against the background of a varied and intricate part of London. They don’t take the most direct route to doing so, but have some fun and diversions along the way. The project is at least three buildings in one. Its upper storeys contain cellular offices and meeting rooms for the LSE’s staff, plus the premises of the Marshall Institute, a body concerned with encouraging philanthropy and social entrepreneurship. Its large basement contains a sports hall, gym, squash courts and music practice rooms. In between, on the first and second levels, are lecture theatres and teaching spaces, distributed across generous spaces described as an “open student commons”. All are reached via a ground-level “great hall”, accessible to the general public, a gently sloping internal plaza that runs from one side of the building to the other. It is located in two different cities, albeit both under the heading of “London”. On one side is the tree-filled rectangle of Lincoln’s Inn Fields, originally laid out in the 17th century, big and formal. On the other is a twisty tissue of little streets that the LSE has progressively inhabited over the decades. Its rickety spirit is set by an old cottage that claims to be the Old Curiosity Shop that inspired one of Charles Dickens’s novels. Grafton takes all this complexity and plays with it. The three main elements of the building are built with concrete frames, each one rotated at an angle to the one below it. The offices above are small and cellular, arranged around an inner court or atrium in a way that Grafton calls monastic, in a constellation of relatively narrow blocks that allows each office to have a window to the outside world. The teaching levels are broad and expansive, filling the plot, the sports spaces another shape again. The building’s arrangement puts small spaces above large ones, which requires a deep and hefty structure, designed by the engineer AKT II, to transfer load on to the few columns of the lower levels. This functional necessity then determines the character of the building – the things that stay most in the memory are the motorway-scaled concrete trees that rise through the lower levels. You could call it three-dimensional chess, but it’s more riotous than that. Other games come to mind: snakes and ladders, the ingenious contraptions of Mouse Trap and Twister, the hallucinatory versions of chess and croquet described by Lewis Carroll. Its floorplans and cross-sections are packed with contrasting shapes and actions, with curves wriggling across the structural grids. On the outside, the building presents different faces to its surroundings. On Lincoln’s Inn Fields, it takes its place in a row of institutional palazzi. Here, Grafton’s design is classical in inspiration, though not in detail, with underlying hierarchy and symmetry, its vertical rhythms echoing the columns and flutings of the next-door Royal College of Surgeons. On other sides, it fragments into the more irregular shapes of its wonkier neighbours. Then these different characters influence and inform each other: renegade angles and asymmetries appear in the more orderly facade, while an even tone of off-white stone and concrete, together with repeating rectangular patterns, helps to unify the rest. Grafton loves inversions and contrasts – things heavy above things that look light, small next to big, deep openings punched in flat surfaces, projection and recession – but it also knows how to pull its design back from the edge of chaos to a place of remarkable coherence. What holds it all together is the building’s sense of what it is, where it is and what it does. Partly, it performs the job of proclaiming a world-famous institution within its cramped and picturesque neighbourhood, in which respect it resembles the Incredible Hulk bursting out of his clothes. Partly, it’s about creating as much shared space as possible for the students to enjoy. Which they obligingly do, bearing laptops and phones and coffees, flooding the seats and tables that furnish the student commons. Thanks to the design’s attention to acoustics, these places are surprisingly calm. All this human energy is then connected back, with the help of balconies, windows and glass walls, to the city around, to tennis players in Lincoln’s Inn Fields and passersby on all sides. You always know where you are, inside the building, in relation to the outside. It also connects to architectural energy, expressed in the conspicuous mass of the structure, in fine detail in bronze and stone, in sinuous benches and wood-clad walls that weave through the robust columns, in a great spiral stair that joins the ground floor to the teaching levels. Some might find the building’s brutalist aesthetic too much and there’s the odd moment when you might wish for a little less concrete. But this is a building of gravity and gravitas, which also achieves intimacy and peace. It runs a remarkable gamut of moods and registers. If “stonking” came from a verb, I’d use it now. It stonks.",Arts/Art and design,"The Marshall Building, London review – brutalist brilliance",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/20/the-marshall-building-london-review-brutalist-brilliance
3/20/2022,"Rachel Reeves sees the clearest, tell-tale signs of poverty among schoolchildren in her Leeds West constituency. “You look at the kids and you just think, I know you are poor. “You can see it in the school coats, especially in the winter, and in the school shoes. Kids not wearing the proper school uniform, sort of a bit of mix-and-match, and it is really sad.” Incomes are two-thirds of the national average in the area she represents, just over £20,000 a year. “Although unemployment is low, a lot of the jobs are not paying wages that you can properly afford to live on,” Reeves says. “So many people rely on universal credit to top up their earnings – 60% of people in poverty today are in work.” When Reeves first became Labour MP for the area 12 years ago, there were no food banks. “Not because no one cared but because we didn’t need them,” she says. Now, they are everywhere and in greater demand than ever as cost-of-living pressures intensify. “We have set up clothing exchanges and school uniform exchanges, we have got a baby bank with stuff for young kids with nappies and clothes for kids. We refer people to food banks regularly. The schools are helping children with school uniforms. It is really tough.” What worries the shadow chancellor most, however, is that poverty is about to get much worse in areas such as Leeds West, as inflation soars and energy prices go through the roof. She produces figures from the Resolution Foundation and other organisations showing that the number of people living in absolute poverty is expected to grow by as much as 1.6 million over the next few years. On Wednesday, her opposite number, the chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak, will deliver his spring statement in the House of Commons with Conservative MPs among those urging him to take much more drastic action on the cost of living crisis. Does Reeves think that Sunak, one of the richest men in British politics, gets it? “We will find out on Wednesday,” she says, adding that there has, as yet, been no sign he does. “He really does need to show more empathy.” In addition to meeting her demands for a windfall tax on the huge profits of North Sea oil and gas companies, to pay for extra help with energy bills, and the scrapping of the planned 1.25 percentage point rise in national insurance due next month, Sunak must, Reeves tells the Observer, raise benefits by about 6% (which is the expected rate of inflation for March) for millions of people who are on low incomes, including pensioners. Under present plans, benefits will rise by just 3.1%, because the level of uplift was set in September last year when that was the rate of inflation. Many thinktanks are now warning of an intolerable drop in real incomes, which will hit the poorest hardest, unless benefits are raised to match the level at which prices are increasing. Some, such as the Resolution Foundation, are calling for a rise in benefits of 8% to match possible inflation later this spring. “I think this an historic moment,” Reeves says, one that will show whether the government understands the plight of low earners. “We have not experienced inflation like this for 30 years now. If the chancellor sticks to his plans for six months ago he will not be rising to the scale of the challenge. “The chancellor should look at how to uprate benefits in a fair way. They are supposed to go up by inflation and they are not at the moment.” She says that he has the necessary cash to act, with VAT and other tax receipts having soared by billions as a result of higher inflation. In February, before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Sunak unveiled what was billed as an emergency £9bn package to help people with their energy costs. One element of the plan was a £200 discount on bills for all households this October. The money would, however, be clawed back from everyone at the rate of £40 a year from 2023 onwards so it was, in a sense, only deferring the pain. The second measure was a £150 rebate from council tax bills to be paid in April to those with homes in bands A to D in England, with the Treasury making money available for the devolved administrations to cut bills by similar amounts. Some think that Sunak will increase the £150 figure on Wednesday and that he will freeze fuel duties yet again, or even cut them. Reeves says that she would support such moves because the situation on the ground is so dire. “I was talking to Citizens Advice and it has had more referrals recently from people in debt with energy companies than they have ever seen before, and that is before the rises that are coming in April,” she says. “People are really scared. Mums and dads especially are worried sick about what is going to happen. If this government is serious about levelling up it has to act.”",News/Society,Shadow chancellor calls for benefits rise to fight poverty,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/20/shadow-chancellor-calls-for-benefits-rise-to-fight-poverty
3/20/2022,"Guanciale is bacon made from the jowl of the pig. It has a much more intense, piggy flavour than bacon. It has a high fat content and is delicious. You can eat it raw from the fridge, like lardo, or wrap things in it and bake them. It’s a good way to take your cooking up a notch. Carbonara, for example, should be made with guanciale. I always use the recipe for carbonara as a kind of manifesto because there’s no bacon, no parmesan, no cream and no extra egg yolks; all the things British people think you put in, but you don’t. The key tastes are pepper, pecorino romano and the porky guanciale. I fry the guanciale in quite a hot dry pan so it’s well browned but not yet crisp all the way through. In a metal bowl, beat together a whole egg per person, quite a lot of pecorino romano and a lot of black pepper. When the pasta is al dente, lift it out of the water, drain it, then toss it in the bacon and the fat in the hot pan. Add the lot to the pecorino and eggs and black pepper with a little water and stir it. It should thicken to the texture of cream. If it doesn’t, put the metal bowl with the pasta and egg mix over the hot pasta water and thicken it up a bit – but don’t let it scramble.

3/20/2022,"In Cartmel in rural Cumbria, Simon Rogan works in splendid isolation. The owner of L’Enclume, which won its third Michelin star in February, spends little time on social media, seldom talks to other chefs and rarely eats out. As he puts it: “We’ve a long-standing, unique style I don’t want infiltrated by other things.” Aulis, his development kitchen, is a silo even within this remote set-up. “For true creativity, you need a quiet, purpose-built area away from the cut and thrust,” says Rogan. Housed in a former post office next door to L’Enclume, it develops dishes for the restaurant and, creatively, operates at a tangent to prevailing food fashions. “Simon wants his food and his ideas, in his style,” says Aulis chef Ben Gallier. Working alone, the 32-year-old’s five-day week is split between two days of dish development and, on three days, combining that with cooking Aulis’s own £195-a-head tasting menu for six guests. This behind-the-scenes experience helps justify Aulis financially. L’Enclume’s first test kitchen was a cut-price, cobbled-together affair but, opened in 2010 and refurbed since, Aulis (named in memory of chef and former employee, Leo Aulis Lehtimäki) is a slick, polished-concrete beauty. Aside from chefs’ bibles, such as the five-volume, science-based Modernist Cuisine, the key reference materials at Aulis include a database of Rogan’s recipes and reports on methods for preserving and fermenting produce from the Cartmel Valley farm, which supplies Rogan’s restaurants. Those reports include warnings about occasional mishaps, such as an attempt to create a beetroot version of black garlic that delivered 50 kilos of mouldy waste. But, more than a decade into the project, this 12-acre farm has become a primary source of inspiration. “We do a lot of reacting to ingredients,” says Gallier, who regularly tours the farm with Rogan, executive chef Tom Barnes and L’Enclume’s head chef, Paul Burgalières. “It sounds fanciful but the best way to come up with dishes is standing in front of ingredients.” Gallier likens it to browsing in the supermarket, spotting pork chops, and meal ideas popping into your head: “You’re not going home and marinating them in shio koji [a Japanese marinade made from fermented rice, water and salt] but the principle is the same.” Can you really achieve food faultless enough for three Michelin stars by responding so quickly to the seasons? Only within a rigorously planned framework. Alessandra Russo, 35, ran Aulis for three years, up until 2020 (she is now kitchen coordinator within Rogan’s company), and can remember some dishes being turned around in two days, “where the idea was right and maybe we had recipes already”. That is rare but illustrates how Aulis enables L’Enclume to stay nimble. Its dish development is built on 20 years of accumulated knowledge. To run Aulis, says Rogan, you have to be “a walking L’Enclume encyclopedia”. Annually, Aulis produces 40 to 50 dishes for L’Enclume. Roughly 40% of those are entirely new and 60% refine, fuse or jump off existing concepts or recipes, some reanimated from previously stalled ideas. Seasonal dishes are designed and tested months in advance of rollout. “L’Enclume has 20 chefs,” says Gallier. “They need training, wines need matching. You can’t change the menu ad hoc.” Ideas for dishes – a mixture of detailed briefs and imaginative experiments – usually originate with Rogan, Barnes or Burgalières, who increasingly act, says Rogan, as a committee. “They’re happy to listen to ideas,” says Russo, who is married to Burgalières. “But they have specific ones you have to work on. You’re not working independently.” Prototype dishes are tasted at fortnightly meetings, followed by fastidious gram-by-gram variations as the dish is honed. “You need patience,” says Russo. “What you develop doesn’t always succeed. Ingredients don’t give flavours you expect, or you can’t fix a presentation or it’s too complicated [to make] during service.” Often, says Rogan, he and his senior staff are at fault for their “shite” ideas. In rejecting the resulting dish, “we’re not having a go at [the development chefs]. No one takes it the wrong way. We move on.” Helpfully, Russo and Gallier understand Rogan’s palate. He likes impactful, balanced dishes, well seasoned with salt (“even for chefs, he’s top 1%,” says Gallier), with good acidity. Gallier remembers a fermented cabbage dish with smoked beetroot sauce that, instantly, he knew Rogan would love for its “bold smokiness, salinity, acidity”. Customer feedback in Aulis can lead to late tweaks, such as dialling down an intense garum served with raw scallop. But new dishes on the Aulis tasting menu – typically, 25% of its 16 courses – are, by that stage, pretty much finalised. They have already been approved for imminent introduction to the menu for L’Enclume. Occasionally, diners would eat at Aulis and score every dish out of 10. Ultimately, only one opinion matters. “I test everything before it goes on the menu,” says Rogan. “The buck stops with me.” At Ottolenghi Test Kitchen, when chefs create a new recipe for publication they crave the approval of one person above all. But it is not Yotam Ottolenghi. Nor the Test Kitchen head chef Noor Murad. In fact, this arbiter of the recipes you cook from the Guardian Feast supplement or Ottolenghi’s cookbooks does not even work at the Holloway site in north London. Instead, when OTK chefs finalise a recipe, they email it to 41-year-old Claudine Boulstridge, Ottolenghi’s failsafe for 15 years, who tests it in her kitchen in Wales. Helped by family and neighbours (“they get what they call ‘the finest cooked meals-on-wheels’”), she feeds back on everything. That means confusing instructions or missing ingredients, flavour, presentation and, despite the old jokes about Ottolenghi’s ingredients, how easy or not it is to shop for the recipe. “Claudine is the ultimate,” says 32-year-old Murad. “I don’t know if she realises how much power she holds over us. We always say, ‘If it has the Claudine seal of approval, we know we’re good.’” OTK, which last year left its original Camden railway arch for the Holloway premises, deliberately uses ageing domestic appliances (there is one new oven, says Murad, “which we all fight over”), but Boulstridge brings a real-world veracity to its work. Originally a colleague of Ottolenghi’s at Leith’s Cookery School, Boulstridge tests “a few recipes a day” for OTK, and relishes her role. “They get a totally unbiased person cooking like someone buying the book would. I’ve got shelves of cookery books and I’m amazed at how a lot of recipes don’t work. That’s not fair on the public.” That independent interaction – allowing staff freedom, encouraging personal ownership of ideas, within a collaborative framework – is typical of how Ottolenghi works. “Yotam’s always around. Signing off, giving his input,” says Murad. “But he’s not a boss who dictates every step. He gives you room to be creative.” This, says Ottolenghi, is key to how his various endeavours – delis, restaurants, cookbooks – remain distinctive within the wider Ottolenghi brand. “At a multiple-site business, only so much creativity can come from the top. It’s a richer environment if people are allowed to create. It’s the DNA of this company.” Ottolenghi has always been open about this, too. From name checks for staff in newspaper columns to bringing them into book deals as co-authors, he has conscientiously promoted colleagues and their ideas. “That’s valued,” says Murad, whose second book in the OTK series, Stock It Up, is due in October. In the restaurants, explains Ottolenghi, there is “no flowchart” to explain how new dishes are created. It is “loose, informal”. The head chefs are expected to cook seasonally but without stipulation about when or how radically their menus should change. OTK will tip off the restaurants about exciting products, such as the Tunisian spinach condiment bkeila, used in Neil Campbell’s celeriac shawarma pitta at Rovi. But there is no pressure to act on these tip-offs. Similarly, the restaurants share a common recipe database and a “long, flexible” list of suppliers, to control costs, but, within reason, are encouraged to evolve their own identity. For example, Ottolenghi Spitalfields has a stronger eastern Mediterranean accent, influenced by its head chefs, previously Turkish (Esra Muslu), now Greek (Xristos Karetsos). Ottolenghi and executive chef Calvin Von Niebel advise on and taste new dishes before they launch. But it is rare for them to come across a dud. “They know what they’re doing. By the time it comes to having a serious conversation, they’ve spent a lot of time [on] the dish,” says Ottolenghi. At OTK, Murad leads on Ottolenghi’s New York Times recipes. Guardian recipes are created by the core team of four chefs. They work alone, recipes allocated to their strengths. “But we have team feedback tastings every day,” says Murad. “My job is to make sure each person has support to get the recipe where it needs to be.” Getting ahead of deadlines is essential, says Ottolenghi, “so you can have fun and experiment”. Inspiration comes in many forms, be it a new ingredient from a specialist supplier, an idea spotted when eating out or, in OTK’s newspaper work, editorial themes arising from important dates such as Easter. “Assign a theme and you’re working within a framework,” says Murad. “That gets ideas ticking.” Amid such dispersed creativity, can Ottolenghi maintain a house style? Yes and no. Internal promotions, rolling conversations and, on occasion, new restaurant chefs spending time at OTK, means the core aesthetic is widely understood: abundant, vegetable-focused dishes, colourfully presented. But the Middle Eastern flavours most associated with Ottolenghi are, increasingly, just one prominent feature of his food. The influence of his staff – a United Nations of food geeks – is giving the company’s work a more international feel. “Instead of wanting us to conform,” says Murad (Bahraini, English mum, studied in New York), “Yotam embraces that and invites that in.” You will find Bab Haus hidden among the garages and builders merchants of Caerphilly’s Bedwas House Industrial Estate, past Screwfix, opposite the Peter’s Pies factory. It’s a US-Mexican-style street food brand which, in everything from its use of ex-dairy beef to its signature birria tacos, is tuned in to the tastiest trends. “We get a lot of inspiration from social media,” says 36-year-old chef-owner Leyli Homayoonfar, discussing the creation of dishes for her mainly takeaway barbecue outlet, HQ Smoke Shop, and its sister site, Bab Haus Mex, a taco spot in a shipping container in Barry. “It’s 2022. People see something on their phone and want to eat it. We’re trying to deliver that.” Each Wednesday, the core team – Homayoonfar, her business partner Rebecca Goad and Homayoonfar’s sisters, Sophia and Soraya – meet to plan the week and discuss any exciting foods they have encountered that “fit our barbecue, smoking, fire narrative”. These self-confessed “super-nerds” have travelled in the US, have knowledgeable friends and family there, eat out and read widely. On WhatsApp, the team is in “continuous” dialogue about episodes of Netflix’s Taco Chronicles or Instagram posts from inspiring fellow barbecue chefs such as Elliot Cunningham (@eatlagom) or Genevieve Taylor (@genevieveeats). “Creatively, everyone’s on the same level. That’s what drives it,” says Homayoonfar, whose youngest staff member is 19. If an idea is backed by the whole team, Homayoonfar will carve out time early in the week – as the production kitchen whirrs around her, curing bacon or slow-cooking meats in its wood-fired smoker – to develop recipes, first for four people, then gradually scaling up. Bab Haus meats can take 24 hours to cook and this “trial and error”, initially documented in notepads and photos, can be laborious. Homayoonfar typically works on six dishes every month. Some are new menu additions, others created with future projects in mind. The challenges are both creative and practical. “Can we execute this during service? Can it be made suitable for meat, veggie and vegan? How much will it cost? What cutlery will it need? It can’t just be tasty.” The birria taco kits, which made Bab Haus’s name during the pandemic, took a few months to get right. “The dish isn’t normally smoked but we smoke and slowly braise ox cheek, short rib and brisket in heavily spiced broth. You reserve the cooking liquor, shred the meat and it’s served in a grilled cheese taco with liquor on the side, to dip your taco in.” Goad had eaten birria from LA food trucks and Homayoonfar knew so-called “red tacos” from Instagram (stained a photogenic crimson by the broth). The pandemic prevented them from travelling to the US or Mexico to investigate further. Instead, they sought inspiration from cookbooks, including Gonzalo Guzmán’s Nopalito and Alex Stupak and Jordana Rothman’s Tacos: Recipes and Provocations, interweaving that guidance with ingredients from specialist suppliers such as Cool Chile and MexGrocer, and, in Homayoonfar’s case, 17 years of experience in professional kitchens. “You need sour, salty, sweet and fat in harmony. Seasoning can make or break a dish,” she says. Even then, there was an element of luck involved. Homayoonfar had bought her Caerphilly unit from a ready-meal producer, inheriting packaging materials which, when the Covid pandemic hit, made the move into producing meal kits easier. Homayoonfar’s business launched in 2019 as a Persian event caterer, Leyli Joon & Co. Covid transformed it overnight. Bab Haus, intended as a street food sideline for the quiet winter months, became her sole focus. Later in 2020, this led to the launch of Bab Haus Mex. “We had no income, we were under pressure,” says Homayoonfar. “We went into creative overdrive.” Creating that new suite of dishes was daunting but it is a discipline – costing, documentation, deadlines – Homayoonfar is familiar with after working at Waitrose and Jamie Oliver’s Recipease, developing dishes for their cookery courses. Despite that experience, there are still occasional missteps, great ideas (a delicate, time-sensitive, lime-cured sea bass ceviche, for example) that prove too stressful to deliver during service. Homayoonfar says that a development chef learns to accept dead ends and embrace robust feedback. She wants buy-in from her team to ensure they are enthusiastic about the product. During testing, she constantly seeks their opinion. “Feedback has to be honest and constructive, and you’ve got to listen. You can’t force your ideas on someone. The person executing the dish has to believe in it.”",Lifestyle/Food,Inside the test kitchens where restaurants cook up new dishes,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/20/you-can-have-fun-and-experiment-inside-the-test-kitchens-where-restaurants-cook-up-new-dishes
3/20/2022,"Twelve key disinformation outlets used to bolster Vladimir Putin have been hit with sanctions in an online crackdown on “false and misleading” reports claimed to be orchestrated by Russian intelligence. The Foreign Office announced last week that sanctions would be imposed on the Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian-based troll factory. Two other alleged disinformation websites, New Eastern Outlook and Oriental Review, were also targeted. The Internet Research Agency has been exposed in the past for paying Russia-based bloggers £500 a month to flood the internet with pro-Putin comments on chat forums, social networks and the comment sections of western publications. Government investigators also claim Russian intelligence supports international news and analysis websites which promote the Kremlin’s view of the Ukraine invasion. Tom Southern, of the Centre for Information Resilience, a non-profit UK social enterprise which counters disinformation, said the impact of Russian information manipulation campaigns in the Ukraine conflict was being blunted by concerted action by governments and social media companies. “This seems to be a turning point against this fake news,” he said. The US treasury has imposed sanctions on the three outlets identified by the UK authorities. It has also taken action against at least nine others, five of which have been targeted with sanctions since the Ukraine invasion. One of the websites sanctioned by the US is the Strategic Culture Foundation, which describes itself as a “platform for extensive analysis on Eurasian and global affairs”. The website has cited Russian claims of a “covert project” to turn Ukraine into a nuclear power. One of its authors also claimed the novichok poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in March 2018 was likely to be a British “false flag” operation to “incriminate, demonise and delegitimise Russia”. The US treasury describes the website as an online journal registered in Russia which is directed by the country’s foreign intelligence service. It states: “It publishes conspiracy theorists, giving them a broader platform to spread disinformation, while trying to obscure the Russian origin of the journal so that readers may be more likely to trust the sourcing.” The Twitter and Facebook accounts of the website have been suspended since September 2020. The Strategic Culture Foundation did not respond to a request for comment, but says on its website that allegations it was connected with Russian intelligence services were “unsubstantiated” and were “a glimpse into the dystopian future of suppressing dissident voices by governments previously known as democratic”. American officials have also sanctioned three other outlets claimed to be linked to the Strategic Culture Foundation: the news outlets SouthFront, NewsFront and InfoRos. All three are alleged by US officials to be connected to Russian intelligence. Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a US group that tracks online disinformation, said it did not appear the tactics previously used to interfere in the American electoral system – with thousands of accounts on numerous platforms – were being widely deployed for the Ukraine conflict. He said Russia-backed websites were being used to get false information and propaganda more widely disseminated, but were being routinely blocked on social media. “They are trying to get dirty information into the online ecosystem and hope it is picked up by websites and individuals with larger reach,” he explained. The Russian state-backed news channel RT had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked by media regulator Ofcom last week. Analysts said the channel’s output was the “tip of the iceberg” in the Kremlin’s propaganda campaign. The Ukraine government has faced disinformation attacks, including a faked video circulated online last week of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy advising his soldiers to lay down their arms. It was quickly dismissed by Zelenskiy as a “childish provocation”. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, last week said the government was taking action against Russian propaganda, from both the Kremlin’s press office and online disinformation outlets. She said: “We are going further and faster than ever in hitting those closest to Putin – from major oligarchs, to his prime minister, and the propagandists who peddle his lies and disinformation. We are holding them to account for their complicity in Russia’s crimes in Ukraine.”",News/World news,West hits Vladimir Putin’s fake news factories with wave of sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/west-hits-vladimir-putins-fake-news-factories-with-wave-of-sanctions
3/20/2022,"Older people face the prospect of “pensioner poverty” due to the rising cost of living and the falling value of the stock market, it has been claimed. Figures from online investment platform Interactive Investor show its customers withdrew a quarter more from their private pensions in January as the cost of energy, food and petrol went up. The figures have prompted concern that pensioners will not have enough money to see them through retirement. In January, the average withdrawal from an Interactive Investor pension was £1,944, up 25% on the average for the same month in previous years. In February, the average was £1,910, up 7% on the same month in previous years. Former pensions minister and campaigner Ros Altmann says these higher withdrawals are a “danger signal for the future”, particularly if they are taking their retirement savings early. “As the cost of basic essentials, such as food and heating have soared, people need higher incomes to cover their bills. Pay increases are far lower than current 30-year record high inflation rates, and people may be searching for other ways to make ends meet,” she says. “For the over-55s, this could mean being tempted to take more money from their pension funds. This is worrying because private pensions are meant to support people after they finish work, rather than topping up pre-retirement earnings. “Higher pension withdrawals now risks rising pensioner poverty in future and lower long-term growth.” Becky O’Connor, head of pensions at Interactive Investor, says the average monthly withdrawal before the pandemic was £1,782. It then dropped to £1,534 as lockdowns were imposed and people were spending less. The combined pressure of a need for cash to cover higher living expenses, and the falling stock market, leads to a “double depletion” effect on savings, she says, and an anxiety for pensioners. “It’s the existential angst perennially faced by retirees on limited means, whose pensions have to last the rest of their lives. “But it’s worse now than ever as a result of diminishing stock market returns and high inflation, which both erodes the value of the pot and puts pressure on people to withdraw more,” says O’Connor. “Withdrawing more from a diminishing pot means a higher risk of running out of money later on. You may take the view that you need it now, whereas you might not need it in 10 or 20 years when you reach your 80s. “That might turn out to be true, but even when you are 80, there can be unexpected calls on your income that you could need to cover.” O’Connor says that she expects to see withdrawals rising even higher in the future as living costs increase, and there are more opportunities to spend with society reopening after the pandemic.",Lifestyle/Money,‘Pensioner poverty’ alarm as older people raid pension pots,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/20/pensioner-poverty-alarm-as-older-people-raid-pension-pots
3/20/2022,"Earlier this month, former foreign minister Sir Alan Duncan warned of the risk of imposing too many sanctions on Russia. He warned the economic retaliation could backfire, with a high cost for Britain. The former Conservative MP highlighted in an interview the risk to future UK gas supplies from sanctions. The message was clear: ministers need to tread carefully in waging economic war against the Kremlin. Duncan, a former minister of state for Europe and the Americas, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Of course we want to disadvantage Russia, but we don’t want to disadvantage ourselves that we fall into some kind of dystopian economic collapse. And we are on the edge of that.” It was a sobering analysis, but failed to note that sanctions also threatened to bite into the revenues of some of the world’s biggest energy traders, including Duncan’s own employer, Vitol. It was said that Duncan worked for a large energy trader in the interview, but did not mention his firm’s significant stake in the biggest oil project in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union, one that Vladimir Putin has said will “strengthen Russia’s position in the Arctic”. While most of the international focus on the energy industry’s links to Russia since the invasion of Ukraine has been on the major oil companies, including BP and Shell, major energy traders are now under mounting pressure over their links to Russia. Vitol and Trafigura, two of the biggest oil traders, have stakes in Vostok Oil, a vast oil and gas oil project in the Arctic. Campaigners warn it will transform a fragile ecosystem into a sprawling industrial hub. It is estimated the project will tap into more than 6bn tonnes of oil reserves, with output proposed to reach more than 100m tonnes a year by 2030, more than the output of the North Sea. w. It is one of Vladimir Putin’s key projects, described by the Moscow Times as “the biggest project in the modern-day global oil industry”. . The scheme will take advantage of the melting Arctic ice, transporting oil across once unpassable shipping lanes via the Northern Sea Route to Asia, circumventing western sanctions. The £110bn project is led by the state-owned Russian firm Rosneft, which is led by oligarch Igor Sechin. The UK government sanctioned Sechin, one of Putin’s inner circle, with an asset freeze and travel ban, earlier this month. Vitol announced in October last year it had led a consortium that had taken a 5% stake in Vostok Oil, along with Singapore-based energy trader Mercantile & Maritime. Trafigura said in December 2020 that it had acquired a 10% holding in the project.BP said last month it would divest its 19.75% stake in Rosneft which it had held since 2013. Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive, also stood down from the board of the Russian oil giant. Russia is the world’s third-biggest oil producer after the US and Saudi Arabia. The US has banned Russian oil imports and Britain will phase them out by the end of this year. Vitol and Trafigura now face questions over their links to Rosneft. Trafigura says it condemns the war in Ukraine; does not operate any assets in Russia; and is reviewing its options over its “passive shareholding” in Vostok Oil. Vitol said: “Vitol is appalled and saddened by the unnecessary and unjustifiable loss of civilian life and the suffering inflicted. Vitol manages its business in full compliance with all applicable sanctions. Vitol has a small, passive and illiquid interest in an upstream asset controlled by Rosneft. Vitol does not have any directors or management in this asset. Funds relating to the transaction were paid in October 2021. No further payments are being made in relation to the investment. Whilst sanctions remain in place, no payments relating to the investment will be received.” While sanctions do not ban trading in Russian oil, some of the biggest energy firms are reducing their reliance on the region. Shell bought a cargo of cheap Russian crude earlier this month, but later apologised and pledged to stop. An investigation of oil and gas shipments from Russian ports by the investigative website SourceMaterial this month found that since the invasion Vitol has loaded or was due to load seven cargos of oil products, some from Rosneft. A report on 16 March by the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based intergovernmental organisation, said Vitol had chartered very large crude carriers to ship Russian crude to China from north-west Europe. The report said Indian Oil Corp bought 3m barrels of Russian urals oil from Vitol for May delivery, its first delivery since the 24 February invasion of Ukraine. Vitol has complied with all sanctions in these shipments. Duncan was an oil trader in his early career and had a friendship spanning nearly four decades with Ian Taylor, the former chair of the Vitol group, who died in June 2020. Taylor was a major donor to the Conservative party and Duncan unsuccessfully lobbied for him to be given a knighthood in David Cameron’s resignation honours. The recommendation was blocked by the honours committee after scrutiny of some of the questionable regimes where Vitol had done business. The firm agreed with the US department of justice in December 2020 to pay $164m to resolve a foreign bribery case. This arose out of alleged Vitol schemes to pay bribes to officials in Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico. In his political diaries, In the Thick of It, published last year, Duncan reflected that he could have made his fortune with “many tens of millions in the bank” if he had joined Vitol in the late 1980s instead of opting for a political career. He joined Vitol Services, a UK firm which is part of the group, as director of business development in January 2020, focusing on the Middle East and Pakistan, after resigning as a minister in July 2019 and standing down as an MP at the last election. A source close to Duncan said he had made it clear that he supported effective sanctions against Russia and he was not involved in any Vitol operations linked to the country. Vitol, which has 40 offices around the world including London, Geneva and Rotterdam, said: “Vitol has in place long-term contracts with Russian entities which it is legally obliged to fulfil. All our business is conducted in strict accordance with applicable sanctions.” The company said it had not entered into any long-term contracts involving Russian oil since the invasion and its trading on the spot market had been significantly reduced and would decline further. The firm said Duncan’s Today interview was conducted on a personal basis. It said: “It was not at Vitol’s behest and the company did not know about the interview until it aired.”",News/Business,Ex-minister who warned on sanctions works for oil trader linked to Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/20/ex-minister-alan-duncan-who-warned-on-sanctions-works-for-oil-trader-linked-to-russia
3/20/2022,"In a pre-show talk, directors Nicolai Khalezin and Natalia Kaliada, founders of the company Belarus Free Theatre, who left their country as refugees 12 years ago to escape Alexander Lukashenko’s regime, sounded subdued as they talked about brutality in Belarus and the escalating war in Ukraine and warned us of what we were about to see on stage: “It’s not an easygoing show, it’s very metaphorical, it makes you think, you will not be relaxed.” With a wan smile, Kaliada recommended we have a drink beforehand. Dogs of Europe – at the Barbican for four performances – is three-and-a-quarter hours long: a surreal, punitive, unforgettable marathon. Performed in Belarusian with English surtitles, it is based on a dystopian novel published in 2017 by Alhierd Bacharevič, set in 2049 and now banned in Belarus. A text projected on to the back of the stage explains there has been a “war of 2022-2025” after which the European continent has become “politically bipolar” with a League of European states opposed by a New Reich – a frighteningly plausible fantasy. Directed and rehearsed on Zoom, this cataclysmic drama was first performed underground in Minsk in 2020 and even with the hi-tech finish of the Barbican production retains the feverish urgency of a street protest. Everyone in the cast has, at some point, been imprisoned and some have been tortured by the increasingly repressive Belarusian authorities. The show’s musicians have had family members killed in Ukraine and their animations designer has left to fight in the war. The first half is set in the east – within the Russian Reich – the second in the west. A schoolboy, played by the show’s dynamic star, Aliaksei Naranovich, befriends a spy until co-opted by an oppressive major to hunt that spy down. There is a rare glimmer of absurdity as the two high-step across the stage in unison and the major explains that his impeccably white suit confounds those who expected him to look like dirt. In the second half, Naranovich plays a German agent in pursuit of a dead Belarusian poet. But there is to be no narrative reprieve. For this is a saga of shattered stories; it is about what happens when the human plot line goes missing. And if its incoherence is frightening and bewildering, one imagines that it conveys something of what it is to live under totalitarianism or to be a refugee, trying to make sense of life. “What year is it?” is a question that keeps resurfacing. It makes one see how displacement and amnesia belong together. The show is vertiginously miscellaneous, with Pythonesque graphics, cut-out clouds, burning books, a hovel in the woods – the setting for a rotten fairytale. At one point, Goya’s The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters floats jauntily overhead. But reason is to be presumed dead. Dogs of Europe comes across as a series of SOSs from an unravelling world, accompanied by the agitated music of Marichka and Mark Marczyk (AKA Balaklava Blues). At the end of the first half, Naranovich runs naked round a bare stage and continues to run throughout the interval. He is as fast as any hunted animal, his plight continuing whether we are watching or not, the significance of which should not escape us. When Mike Bartlett wrote Cock in 2009, he derived his inspiration from the sport of cockfighting to explore an adversarial crisis between three lovers. His play has a bravura theatricality and was a hit at the Royal Court when first staged. This revival takes place on an empty stage with burnished steel walls (by designer Merle Hensel) within which John, played by Jonathan Bailey with mercurial angst, is tormented by an inability to decide whether or not he is gay. Is he more drawn to his boyfriend M (Taron Egerton) or his more recently acquired girlfriend W (sparkily played by Jade Anouka, her lustful propositioning arising from out-of-control loneliness). The evident intention is that Cock should address us freshly, as gender and sexuality issues are more complicatedly nuanced than ever before. Marianne Elliott’s immaculate production moves seamlessly between the lovers’ conversations as they unpick desire, unhappiness and the challenges of commitment. But its greatest pleasures are wordless. There is wonderful, hyperbolic choreography between conversations, to express lust and anguish. At one point, John swoons backwards from the waist as the stage’s revolve carries him full circle. At another, he is contorted by desire and, in a third, he is drawn into M’s arms like they are two magnets that cannot stay apart. There is also the pleasingly novel Elliott innovation of undressing scenes in which actors stay fully clothed. But it is Taron Egerton’s M who makes the evening, with his phenomenal ability to combine comedy with desolation. In the showdown dinner that ends the play, he keeps popping off to check on the beef, his chin up as if expecting to be martyred and photographed simultaneously. He is like a strange cartoon: his smile fixed, tears pin-pricking his eyes, his arms sometimes dangling as if out of their sockets. His performance is judiciously and brilliantly exaggerated, with his smile becoming more shark-like as he turns small talk into open hostility. What matters is that he makes you care. Phil Daniels as F, M’s cadaverous father, also entertains, bringing dark relief. But the problem with this play is that, for all its ingenious wrangling, John remains tiresome and W an enigma. And while no one would disagree with Bartlett about the validity of wishing to be understood as an individual rather than sexually labelled, it is a conclusion that now seems uncontroversial rather than groundbreaking.

3/20/2022,"As a teenager, Sera Hersham-Loftus expressed herself in two distinct ways. The first was in her clothes: Victorian camisoles mixed with spooky eyeliner for a Siouxsie Sioux meets Tess of the D’Urbervilles effect (this was the 1980s). Decorating was the other. “I was always painting my bedroom walls and moving the furniture around. I’d borrow my mother’s scarves and drape them over lampshades for a romantic effect.” All this was an escape from “the strict, depressing formality” of her all-girls’ school. School was not for her – “I was the class joker; always answering back” – so she left at 15, relieved to be able to “earn my own money and feel independent”. Determination, combined with chutzpah, landed her a job at Sadler’s Wells in the set-design department. Despite no formal training, she discovered she had a knack for bringing spaces to life with paint, fabric and resourcefulness. When friends began to ask her to do up their houses “it was as if I was predestined to become an interior designer,” she says. Since then she has always used her own homes as a test bed for decorating ideas. And this apartment that she bought in 2015 in Little Venice, London – set across two stucco-fronted townhouses – is a case in point. Its developer had “ripped the heart and soul” out of the Victorian building. Mouldings and fireplaces were all gone; the stair rail replaced by “a horrible twirling plastic thing”. But that suited Hersham-Loftus, whose look – bohemian and boudoir-ish with a rock’n’roll edge – is distinctly hers. “I couldn’t live with someone else’s taste. I’m a purist about what I do. I like to start from scratch and create my own, made-up worlds.” Her apartment has been through several redesigns. She created wallpapers and commissioned the handmade tiles in the dressing area, where wardrobes are made from old French shutters. At first the walls were painted a “pale mushroom… like the backdrop for a John Galliano fashion shoot”. At one point she brought the terrace plants inside so that “everything felt dark and mysterious, like an urban jungle”. While working on a townhouse in Amsterdam, she spotted that the builders were ripping out the interior of the house next door. She rushed outside and struck a deal to buy the decorative panelling and the long, wide Baltic pine flooring. It has now been restored and fitted in her sitting room, part of a trio of grand but convivial reception rooms which Hersham-Loftus likes to call – with irony – her “salons”. For its latest incarnation, she asked longstanding colleague, the decorative-effects specialist Andrea Bizzarro, to give the interior “the feel of a Venetian palazzo that hadn’t been touched for 90 years”. Faded macaroon hues mixed specially sit well with the salvaged French fireplaces and the Victorian armchairs, stripped back to reveal their horsehair innards for “theatrical” effect. “I always buy unserious antiques; they have soul, but you don’t need to worry about damaging them.” Certain aspects of the Hersham-Loftus look never change. “I don’t like overhead lighting. I like my spaces to feel mysterious – and transportative. And I always use natural materials, like linen or stone. I’m a fan of low seating and I don’t have doors, apart for the bedrooms; you don’t really need them, and they get in the way.” Black ceilings are another trademark. “You’d think it would feel oppressive, but it’s not, they help to ground a room and its contents.” She has always been drawn to upcycling, turning humdrum objects into something magical. She persuaded the owner of a smart London restaurant to give her the mollusc shells which now decorate the fire surround in the kitchen. She has turned antique shoe lasts into lampstands, festooned with glinting glass droplets. Her latest creation is curtains made from scraps of antique lace – draped across windows and openings they diffuse the light like silky cobwebs for a modern Miss Havisham effect. Her Instagram fans love them. “There’s a real revival in antiques and the handmade, especially among younger buyers,” says Hersham-Loftus who’s currently working on an apartment for Charlotte Watts, granddaughter of the late Rolling Stone Charlie. “For them all this feels new and different. I also think it’s a reaction to the digital age. People crave something cosy and tactile – a place to escape to.” She’s bringing a similar effect to the “wellness retreat” she is currently designing for Charlotte Church. Set in Laura Ashley’s sprawling former home in Wales, the singer’s brief was “for a mystical, ‘witch’s apothecary’ setting, full of antiques, old panelling and muted light.” A kindred spirit then? “We gel. I’m fortunate that the people I work for buy into my vibe, my style.” “It’s like my home, you know,” she concludes, sinking into a pile of peachy silk cushions. “I can’t imagine living somewhere that didn’t express me and my ideas. This is my world.” For information, go to seraoflondon.com; instagram.com/seraoflondon",Lifestyle/Life and style,Coup de théâtre: dramatic looks in a lavish London flat,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/20/coup-de-theatre-dramatic-looks-in-a-lavish-london-flat
