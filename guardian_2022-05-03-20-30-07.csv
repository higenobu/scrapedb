5/3/2022,"Let’s cut to the chase. No prime minister or treasurer wants an interest rate hike in the middle of an election campaign focussed on rising living costs. Not Scott Morrison. Not Josh Frydenberg. But the Reserve Bank has increased the cash rate, and the central bank governor, Philip Lowe – who has the benign demeanour of a country parson in a Jane Austen novel – has signalled further increases are coming to counter inflationary pressure in the economy. Rates, Lowe warned on Tuesday, are now on a path to 2.5%. Tuesday was the end of free money in other words. A big development. A blow to the aspirational Australians staking both the present and their future on the free money they’ve grown pretty accustomed to. Often treasurers respond to epochal misfortune alone. But misery loves company. Tuesday’s decision by the central bank was the first upward movement in interest rates in more than a decade. The last time interest rates went up during a federal election, back in 2007, the incumbent lost the contest and lost his seat – largely because events, in concert with his record, framed John Howard as a leader with more slogans than solutions. Given that, the pressures and the bad portents, call it a sense of déjà vu, Frydenberg brought his wing man – the prime minister. Morrison was asked upfront by one of the travelling impertinences whether or not he had just lost the election. The prime minister was curt. “Of course not.” That was the cue to start pedalling, and pedal they did. Morrison suggested the looming rate increase (worth about $85 a month on an average mortgage) was, in some respects, a dividend of Australia’s economic success. This was a sign of the strength of Australia’s economy, bouncing back after Covid. Before anyone could genuflect, or holler “just how tremendous are you – no, really”, Morrison observed that Australians had been preparing for this eventuality for some time and had “strengthened their balance sheets”. Now it’s possible this sort of language resonates in some parts of the country, where household incomes are generous enough to warrant the status of a balance sheet. I’m prepared to hear submissions on this point. But having been on a campaign stop earlier in the day at a household on the New South Wales Central Coast where a young woman couldn’t afford to save for a mortgage because her rent was so high, strengthening the balance sheet really didn’t feel that relevant an observation. The rhetoric felt pretty ludicrous quite honestly. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ludicrous or not, Morrison ploughed on. The prime minister noted he’d met the current cost of living challenges through recent budget measures and through tax relief. Frydenberg declared the government had people’s backs, which sounded pleasingly collegiate. The problem with the collegiality, though, is it’s not absolute. The cash payments and cuts to fuel excise in the Coalition’s pre-election budget are temporary, and the cycle of rising prices and rising rates looks to be with us for a little while, which for many people would feel like the working definition of sucks to be us. Tuesday’s “please don’t let this be 2007” pitch contained all the usual parameters – all the good bits of the story reflected Morrison and Frydenberg’s general beneficence and the bad bits weren’t Morrison or Frydenberg’s fault. The pair worked up to their counterpoint crescendo. Morrison and Frydenberg declared these were very uncertain times and Australians would be much better placed sticking with the current government (the one presiding over the rising prices and rising rates) because the alternative was way, way scarier. As could have been predicted (and in fact was) from the moment Anthony Albanese stumbled on day one of the election campaign with his brain fade on the cash rate – Morrison grabbed the helpful gaffe. The prime minister noted this bloke (that would be Albanese) who didn’t even know what the cash rate was three short weeks ago (but who’s counting) now (somehow) believes he’s best to manage these very dicey conditions. We were back to the ballad of the devil you know – Morrison’s 2022 campaign anthem. I shouldn’t say “back” because truth is we never left. This pitch is beyond dreary. Vote for us because we’ll do great things is compelling, it’s always electrifying, whether you agree with the things or not. But vote for us because we are not Labor is actually the most unfulfilling call to action in recent memory. Is this really it? All you’ve got guys? At this moment in history? But voters should not assume because Morrison’s arguments are tired, self-serving, and often internally contradictory, that this shtick won’t work. It might work, and we know Morrison will throw everything he has at making his message stick.",News/Australia news,‘Vote for us because we are not Labor’ is the most unfulfilling call to action in recent memory | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/vote-for-us-because-we-are-not-labor-is-the-most-unfulfilling-call-to-action-in-recent-memory
5/3/2022,"Sex Pistols’ God Save the Queen, arguably the most iconic single in punk rock history, is to be reissued to mark Elizabeth II’s upcoming platinum jubilee. The band’s second single after Anarchy in the UK, it was released in 1977 alongside the Queen’s silver jubilee with a decidedly anti-royalist bent, comparing the monarchy to a “fascist regime … She’s not a human being / and there’s no future / and England’s dreaming”. Despite being banned from BBC radio and television, the song reached No 2 – held off the top by Rod Stewart – though rumours have persisted ever since that the charts were manipulated to keep the song away from the No 1 spot. In its listing on the charts, it was blanked out so as not to offend the Queen. Now, the song has another chance to reach the top, as thousands of physical copies are repressed for release on 27 May. Four thousand copies of the version released on Virgin Records will be released, with Did You No Wrong on the B-side. Another 1,977 copies of the single’s original version on A&M Records will also be released, with its own original B-side, No Feeling. The original A&M version is one of the most sought-after releases in rock history. The band had signed to the label in a ceremony outside Buckingham Palace in March 1977, but after a couple of incidents – including a friend of A&M’s director being threatened by a hanger-on of the band – they were dropped six days later, and nearly all of the 25,000 pressed copies of God Save the Queen were destroyed. Copies of the A&M version have since been sold for up to $22,155 (£17,700). Pistols drummer Paul Cook later said that God Save the Queen wasn’t written to mark the silver jubilee: “We weren’t aware of it at the time. It wasn’t a contrived effort to go out and shock everyone.” Originally titled No Future, it had been performed on tour in 1976. Nevertheless, under the aegis of manager Malcolm McLaren, the band renamed it God Save the Queen, and embraced the potential for provocation. They performed a concert on the jubilee itself on a boat called the Queen Elizabeth, sailing on the Thames – various members of the boat party were swiftly arrested when they docked. Lyricist John Lydon, AKA Johnny Rotten, later brushed off the idea that it was a sustained, angry attack on the monarchy. “God Save the Queen – it’s kinda camp in a way. You certainly don’t think it’s gonna be taken as a declaration of civil war,” he said. Nevertheless, the band members were subjected to physical attacks by offended listeners in the wake of the song’s release, including with razor blades and iron bars. The release comes amid other high-profile activity for the band: Pistol, a Danny Boyle-directed TV miniseries dramatising the Sex Pistols, is to premiere on 31 May. Lydon unsuccessfully sued the rest of the band over use of their music in the show, with a judge ruling that the band’s legal agreements meant they were entitled to make majority decisions over such uses.",Arts/Music,Still a fascist regime?

5/3/2022,"A Guardian article about a Welsh shepherd who works alone on his farm, has never left his valley and eats the same meal every day has been turned into a short documentary film which will premiere at Tribeca film festival. Heart Valley, directed by Christian Cargill, beat more than 7,000 submissions to secure its place in the competition. It follows a day in the life of Wilf Davies, who was the centre of an article by Kiran Sidhu in the Guardian last year. The article struck a chord with millions at the height of lockdown. Faced with a rapidly changing farming community, Wilf’s inquisitive attitude and connection to nature provoked big questions about what it is we should truly value, Cargill said. “I think for a lot of people that spent lockdowns in cities, Wilf’s story really touched on that yearning to disconnect,” Cargill said. “I remember first reading the piece and finding it inspiring, unconventional and deeply heartfelt. Two weeks on, I realised I was still thinking about this shepherd I’d never met called Wilf and in that moment I knew it was a story I wanted to explore, to find out more about this man and his life.” The London-based documentary film-maker and photographer, who has worked across productions for Netflix, HBO, Vice Studios and the BBC, said he was struck by Wilf’s sensibilities. “Of course there’re eccentricities about him – his routine of the same meals every day for example, but what I’ve loved and learnt from spending so much time with him making this film, is his quietly profound message to the world: be kind, have compassion and take some time out of each day to truly appreciate your surroundings and place.” Original music for the film was composed by the Scottish multi-instrumentalist Erland Cooper. Sidhu said it was “both surprising and unsurprising that a story about a humble farmer spoke to so many. Surprising because, in so many ways, we are told that we need so many things in order to be content. And unsurprising because the pandemic shifted our value system; we questioned the quality of our lives.” When Wilf found out the film would be going to New York, Sidhu added, he cried. “He was so overwhelmed. There was something quite beautiful about the fact that after I told him this news, he turned away and tended to his sheep. “Some people can remain unchanged, no matter how alluring and exciting the news. He really is that contented man who loves the life that he leads – no matter what the world may tell him.” Heart Valley will have its world premiere as part of Tribeca’s 2022 official selection in June.",Arts/Film,Film inspired by Guardian piece on Welsh shepherd to debut in New York,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/03/film-inspired-by-guardian-piece-on-welsh-shepherd-to-debut-in-new-york
5/3/2022,"In the 1997 general election Roy Jenkins compared Tony Blair to a man carrying a Ming vase across a slippery floor, tiptoeing gingerly towards a Labour victory. The same description fits Sinn Féin as it approaches Northern Ireland’s assembly election on Thursday, cautiously edging towards a potentially momentous win. The prize is to emerge as the region’s largest party and claim the post of first minister – a symbolic and psychological breakthrough for Irish nationalism given Northern Ireland was designed to have a permanent unionist majority. Sinn Féin’s response to this giddy prospect has been to run an ultra-guarded, disciplined campaign that minimises gaffes, surprises or spontaneity – anything that might risk a slip. “I’ve never seen Sinn Féin be so cautious here, they’re really determined to not frighten the horses,” said Jon Tonge, a University of Liverpool politics professor and authority on Northern Ireland. “Their last big controversy was two years ago. They used to have one every two months. They’re taking it to new levels to not upset anyone.” The party that once acted as a mouthpiece for the IRA has played down its push for a united Ireland and focused on the cost of living, a healthcare crisis and other bread-and-butter issues. During Easter, republican commemorations leaders paid tribute to the movement’s sacrifices and martyrs without naming the IRA. The tactic is one reason the overall election campaign has so far been a sedate affair, with few sparks or memorable moments. Pundits have branded it “dull” and “boring”. The low-key atmosphere has undermined attempts by some unionists to depict this as an existential battle over Northern Ireland’s place in the UK. In a televised debate on Sunday night, Michelle O’Neill, the party’s leader in Northern Ireland, stuck to familiar lines seemingly designed to soothe any concerns around her becoming first minister. “There was nothing awful about Michelle O’Neill’s performance, but there was nothing memorable about it either,” said the Belfast Telegraph. For Sinn Féin that would be a good result given O’Neill was put under pressure over a disclosure her party had sought political engagement with Saoradh, a republican party allegedly linked to the New IRA. “No gang who is involved in criminality, armed action, should exist today,” she said. O’Neill’s debate performance was another example of Sinn Féin’s softly-softly approach, said Deirdre Heenan, a social policy professor at the University of Ulster. “They feel the first minister post is within their grasp. For them what’s important is not to make a gaffe, not to get embroiled in controversy.” That was why the party had given John Finucane, a high-profile lawyer and its MP for Belfast North, a prominent role in the campaign, said Heenan. “I think that’s a clever strategy. He’s a middle-class, articulate professional with a cross-community background. He has been put out to attract non-aligned voters.” Mary Lou McDonald, the party’s Dublin-based leader and another able media performer, has also been prominent. Opinion polls suggest Sinn Féin will be the biggest party but fall far short of a majority in the 90-seat Stormont assembly, which will be elected by proportional representation in 18 five-member constituencies. The most recent poll put Sinn Féin on 26%, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) on 20%, the centrist Alliance on 14% and smaller nationalist and unionist parties accounting for most of the rest. Sinn Féin hopes the prospect of O’Neill becoming first minister will animate its base and that disdain for the DUP will encourage Alliance and Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) voters to give transfers to Sinn Féin candidates. By avoiding traditional Irish republican tropes the party also hopes to encourage some unionists to abstain or at least not transfer votes to the DUP, which has been convulsed over Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol. If overall support levels are replicated in seats, power-sharing rules would make O’Neill eligible to be first minister and the DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, deputy first minister, posts of equal power at the head of an executive drawn from all major parties. Sinn Féin has been in the executive since the 1998 Good Friday agreement and held the deputy first minister post since 2007. In practical terms, nudging ahead of the DUP and nabbing the first minister post would not change the balance of power. Nor would it signal a surge in support for a united Ireland. Most voters favour remaining in the UK. But the symbolism would matter, said Tonge. “It would be huge. The stakes are genuinely high.” Sinn Féin would not push for an immediate border poll – not least because it would almost certainly lose – but use its victory to foster momentum for a referendum further bolstered by the party’s growing clout in the south, said Tonge. Donaldson has refused to say whether he would serve in an executive with O’Neill as first minister, fuelling expectations of weeks or months of post-election wrangling before a new executive is formed. In addition to the Northern Ireland protocol, which unionist parties want removed or diluted, there will be arguments over rules on mandatory power-sharing. The requirement helped clinch the Good Friday agreement but is blamed for locking parties into dysfunctional executives that squabble, collapse and neglect services, notably healthcare.

5/3/2022,"The UK government is to formally consider the impact of its flagship energy efficiency plan on people most at risk from soaring bills, citing the conflict in Ukraine as a factor. The move comes after officials admitted they did not carry out an equality assessment of the heat and buildings strategy before it was announced last autumn. It sets out to slash carbon emissions from 30m homes and workplaces and is a key part of the UK’s net zero target. Last month it was criticised by the independent statutory Climate Change Committee, which said more investment was needed in energy efficiency and low-carbon heat improvements for fuel-poor homes, “especially given that the number of households in fuel poverty is rising dramatically as the wholesale price of gas rises to unprecedented levels”. Friends of the Earth uncovered the absence of a public sector equality duty assessment during a high court claim alleging the strategy breached equalities law. The environmental campaign group believes key policies to help the most vulnerable people to reduce emissions are missing from the strategy launched by the business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, before the UN Cop26 climate summit in November. The government’s decision to belatedly check the impact on the most vulnerable comes amid predictions that up to 40% of UK people could be in fuel poverty by October, when energy prices are expected to rise again after a 54% increase for many households this month. On Tuesday, Boris Johnson said the government could do more to tackle soaring bills, but added: ”The crucial thing is to make sure we deal with the prices over the medium and long term.” Among current responses, he cited payments being administered by councils for citizens in particular hardship. Friends of the Earth wants the strategy to include initiatives such as a council-led programme of free insulation in poorer areas and greater assistance to poorer people to switch from gas boilers to heat pumps above the £5,000 grants included in the current plan, which will not cover the full cost at the moment. “The transition to a zero-carbon economy must be fair and inclusive and must not worsen existing inequalities in society,” said Tony Bosworth, an energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “By not even considering this in relation to a key part of its zero-carbon plan, the government seriously undermined this goal.” The government previously claimed it did not need to carry out a full assessment as the plan was only a “strategic overview”, with more detailed policies to come. However, it did include a £450m plan to replace boilers and £3.9bn to decarbonise buildings and how they are heated, with a 2035 target for all new home heating systems to be energy efficient. Previous research has shown that minority ethnic people are twice as likely to be living in fuel poverty as white people, while areas identified by the government as having a high number of residents with disabilities are more likely to be rated in the worst category for fuel poverty. “It is a good thing if [the government] is forced to [consider the impact], but after so many many times when people at the bottom have been ignored, we are waiting to see what this looks like in practice,” said Ruth London, a spokesperson for the Fuel Poverty Action campaign group. Government officials said they were preparing an overarching equalities impact assessment to remove any doubt about the strategy’s implications, particularly given gas price volatility and the war in Ukraine affecting fuel imports. “We consider the equalities impacts of all our policies and develop an equality impact assessment once policies reach a suitable point in their development,” said a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. “Our priority is to ensure we treat all members of our society fairly.”",News/Society,Government to consider impact of UK energy efficiency plan on poor households,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/03/government-to-consider-impact-of-energy-efficiency-plan-on-poor-households
5/3/2022,"A senior Victorian detective who was paid by an associate to resolve personal disputes used police stations to interview people, threatened to charge them with criminal offences, and used police databases improperly as part of the longstanding relationship, the state’s anti-corruption commission alleges. Det Sgt Wayne Dean has admitted to being paid on multiple occasions by Basilios (Bill) Meletsis, who he met more than three decades ago through “the Carlton restaurant scene”, and to completing “jobs” for his associate as recently as February. At an Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission (Ibac) hearing on Tuesday, counsel assisting Ibac, Catherine Boston, said Dean was also being investigated for his alleged association with Mick Gatto, a prominent figure in Melbourne’s gangland war who was associated with the “Carlton Crew”. Dean, a 37-year veteran of the force, is on leave from his position at the Melbourne crime investigation unit, based in Docklands. He met Meletsis in the 1990s, as Meletsis’s parents owned a restaurant in Carlton’s Lygon Street that was regularly visited by police. After falling out of touch with him for a period, they became reacquainted through a Sydney builder, whose identity has been suppressed by Ibac. Dean told Ibac that he had completed jobs for Meletsis, and that his friend had paid him on multiple occasions, but that the payments were not necessarily for the jobs. He said he may have received payments as large as $200 from Meletsis on six or seven occasions. Dean told the hearing that as part of this relationship he had used his position to obtain footage of a theft of illegal tobacco, and then given that footage to Meletsis, even though he was concerned that the people responsible for the robbery could be seriously injured or killed as a result. Boston asked Dean about evidence which she said suggested he may have been paid thousands of dollars for obtaining the robbery footage. The evidence includes a conversation taken from a recording device in which Meletsis tells an associate that Dean had asked for a “big coffee” for his help on the job and further conversations involving Meletsis in which he says he and Dean were paid $5000 for obtaining the footage. Boston said other footage of Meletsis showed him “flicking through a bundle of cash”, and Meletsis meeting Dean meeting outside the Melbourne West police station and passing him an item. Dean told the hearing that despite his previous denials about receiving a payment for obtaining the footage, it was “possible but I can’t recall” that he had actually been paid by Meletsis. Boston said that in a private hearing Meletsis told Ibac investigators he had made no payments to Dean. He denied suggestions made by Meletsis in an intercepted conversation with another individual that implied Dean was aware the stolen tobacco was worth $1.7m and that Dean warned Meletsis not to do any “kind of homicides” after receiving the footage. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On 17 February this year, two days after the meeting between Dean and Meletsis outside the police station, the detective’s house and office were raided by Ibac investigators. There was $18,000 in cash found in a safe in Meletsis’s walk-in robe at his Moonee Ponds house, and $1,300 cash found in a desk drawer in his office at the police station. Earlier in the hearing, Boston said that the Ibac investigation started after a Chinese migration agent made a complaint to the Australian Border Force alleging that she had paid $11,000 to Dean and Meletsis to recover a significant amount of money owed to one of her clients. Boston said the agent alleged that Dean then conducted “mediations” at the Melbourne West station between her and the alleged debtor, and took a police statement from her, but that the money had not been recovered. Dean will appear again before the hearing on Wednesday.",News/Australia news,"Victorian detective used police station for private jobs, Ibac hearing told",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/victorian-detective-used-police-station-for-private-jobs-ibac-hearing-told
5/3/2022,"Save for a festival performance at Download 2019, this is Tool’s first UK date in almost 15 years. Though time has not softened frontman Maynard James Keenan: “If grandpa can stand up and dance around like an idiot, so can you,” he levels at a mostly seated Manchester audience. That soon changes. When grunge faded and nu-metal began to rip through rock’s hierarchy in the mid-90s, Los Angeles quartet Tool offered something entirely different. The band’s transcendent union of visual arts and stormy, offbeat prog-metal secured their status as one of the genre’s greatest enigmas. Albeit unwittingly, the 13-year gap between 2006’s 10,000 Days and 2019’s Fear Inoculum only intensified Tool’s myth. Tours have been similarly sporadic. None of this is lost on tonight’s spectators, who are already at fever pitch by the time Fear Inoculum’s opening strains fill the room. For the first quarter, the band perform behind a translucent curtain that mirrors the visuals displayed on the towering screens at the back. Something resembling the Eye of Sauron appears to swallow the stage whole, while Keenan prances around the drum riser like a mohawked Gollum. On Pneuma, unassuming guitarist Adam Jones and staggeringly talented drummer Danny Carey combine to pulverising effect. When Keenan isn’t singing, he’s marvelling at Carey and trying to tap along to his impossible polyrhythms. Often hitting the 10-minute mark, these are better understood as miniature opuses rather than songs. The Grudge twists and turns from fierce, lunging riffs to ethereal bass passages. Each section receives frenzied, arena-wide roars. Their track Descending swells with metallic bombast and dazzling guitar work, but it’s Carey’s defiant gong blast that sees it over the peak – emphatically expelling 10 minutes of existential tension. Sometimes it feels like performance for the sake of it, but whether it’s the master musicianship or mesmeric visuals, the sensory assault never lets up. “It’s been for ever, but it’s great to see you,” Keenan says before closer Invincible. He ponders the band’s shelf life as he sings: “Beating chest and drums / Beating tired bones again.” Doubtless by design, it lurches along to a spectacular, riff-soaked finale. By this point, Carey has abandoned the off-kilter beats in favour of dizzying, incalculable drum fills. Keenan needn’t worry: there’s plenty of life in them yet.

5/3/2022,"When Louise Michel – teacher, anarchist, and revolutionary-in-exile – arrived in London after seven years banishment in the South Pacific, she brought five cats with her. Escorted from the ship under the coats of sympathisers, the oceanian felines, exhausted from their 10,000-mile journey, recovered quickly when presented with “an enormous bowl of milk” under the doting eye of their mistress. Back in Paris a few years later – cats in tow – Michel tried to explain her solicitude for the fragile animals. Taken from New Caledonia, her place of exile, to France, the land of her birth, the cats represented to Michel something elusive, precious, instinctual; hard to find, easy to lose. They reminded her, she said, of home. And although William Atkins’s Exiles is framed by the pain and self-discovery of exile, it’s home that draws his subjects out; raises them up; and pulls them back, in the end, to where they began. Exile isn’t, as Atkins shrewdly comments on Ovid’s poems on the theme, a place so much as a process, a movement. All three of Atkins’s subjects – Michel; Russian anthropologist Lev Shternberg, and deposed African king Dinuzulu – discover that it’s a movement that can last a whole life. As another of the book’s luminaries, Victor Hugo, notes: once an exile, always an exile. You can go back to the place you started from. But you can never go home. In a restless, rootless world, the idea of exile has broad purchase. Atkins taps into this, judiciously mixing history with memoir: at the time he’s researching the book, travelling from Siberia to the South Atlantic, his father, back home, is dying. But Atkins’s eye for the personal – Zulu chieftains with collapsing hairstyles, assassins with anxiety, a migrant family’s private grief – is matched by his acute awareness that this both is and isn’t all there is. The point at which personal and political become mutually inescapable: that, Atkins says, is where exile is. Each of his subjects felt that tension keenly; each suffered a painful collision between their desires and the insensate demands of state and law: the catch and pull of history on the make. Michel saw the streets of Paris run red with blood when the Commune was suppressed in the semaine sanglante, the “bloody week”. Dinuzulu witnessed the end of his kingdom: Zululand was politically and spiritually dismembered by the British empire. Shternberg, a socialist Jew in tsarist Russia, endured brutal political repression alongside the lifelong threat of antisemitic violence. It got worse. Michel was sent to New Caledonia, a French colony ill-at-ease with itself and with a brutally oppressed native population. Dinuzulu was stranded on Saint Helena – the same bleak South Atlantic islet Napoleon died on. Shternberg was immured on the “last refuge of the unshot”, Sakhalin island, in Siberia’s frozen east. All three could well have died. That was expected. Exile the noun is predicate on exile the verb. It’s always something done; something done to you. The powers that banished Michel, Shternberg and Dinuzulu had several names – Britain, France, Russia – of which only one really matters: empire. Empire took Michel, Dinuzulu and Shternberg from their homes. Atkins identifies a subtler, more radical dislocation at work, too: empire took home from them. A people uprooted are a people undone; disquieted, doubtful, easy to control. The movement of exile – the movement of empire – carries us away from ourselves. Exile’s strongest moments are worked out in the shadow of this insight: a present-day fete on Saint Helena, lit by the half-life glow of the sun that never set; the crude commercialism and dying machines of post-Soviet Sakhalin; New Caledonia, still a colony, still ill-at-ease. The exiles outlasted their exile. But empire outlasted both. Atkins’s subjects defied expectations; defied, in a sense, exile itself. Shternberg invents modern anthropology; Dinuzulu reinvents kingship. Michel goes further, dreaming of a time when exile, a tool of oppression, could become the sign and seedbed of liberation. She imagined building a house of exiles, a universal asylum for the dispossessed and the refugee. It would be built in London, where, she said, “my banished friends are always welcome”. We’ve come a long way; we’re still a long way from home.  Exiles: Three Island Journeys by William Atkins is published by Faber (£20).

5/3/2022,"“Let’s kill all the lawyers,” cries a rebel in Shakespeare’s Henry VI Part 2, raising a loud audience cheer. Now it’s Jeremy Hunt and his health and social care committee that threatens to skewer lawyers, specifically the personal injury ambulance-chasers, who are of course outraged. Hunt’s radical plan to reform compensation for clinical negligence is “completely unacceptable” says the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, which includes some of the kinds of firms that urge people to sue the NHS, soliciting online, in TV ads or posters in waiting rooms. Damages paid by the NHS as a result of medical negligence claims have soared exponentially over the last decade, up from £900m to £2.2bn now. Yet despite horror stories of deaths and life-changing damage in badly run maternity wards, the National Audit Office finds no evidence of more injuries, only that the number of claims and sums awarded by courts are shooting up. The NAO found that “the claimant’s legal costs exceeded the damages awarded in 61% of claims settled”. Though the lawyers in the clinical compensation business protest vigorously that they defend patients’ rights, the Hunt committee demolishes any justification for the present system. The report quotes Sir Ian Kennedy QC, the chair of many inquiries and emeritus professor of health law and ethics at University College London, who wrote in 2021 that clinical negligence was an “outdated, arbitrary and scandalously expensive system” with a “stranglehold that lawyers exert over a system that should be putting the interests and needs of patients first”. What injured patients need is an independent authority to conduct a speedy and transparent investigation of what went wrong, with everyone free to speak openly, ending in reasonable compensation and a pledge to prevent anyone else being put at risk by the same error. Peter Walsh, the chief executive of Action Against Medical Accidents, told the committee that litigation was often “a last-gasp attempt to get a sense of justice and to get to the bottom of what has actually happened after people have experienced denial after denial”. A trust’s defensive wall of silence under threat of a huge claim leaves bereaved families with nowhere to turn but the very welcoming arms of personal injury lawyers. It takes an average – yes, an average – of 11.5 years to reach a settlement on a claim for a brain injury at birth, with a high burden of proof to find someone to blame. The £2.2bn compensation this year would more than pay for a 5% pay increase for NHS staff. Worse, the NHS is obliged to hold liabilities of £82.4bn for ongoing cases in case it has to pay out. This is escalating fast: those liabilities were only £9bn in 2007. And who really wins? Legal costs gobbled up a quarter of everything the NHS paid out last year. Here’s another extraordinary revelation. The amount of compensation for a child’s injury is calculated on what their lifetime earnings might have been. That’s estimated based on the parents’ education, income and standard of living, by assuming the child would have followed in their footsteps. The baby of a banker gets many multiples more compensation than the family of a cleaner. Hunt tells me that Guys and St Thomas’ hospital was recently ordered to pay £37m to a family. “We don’t know who won that compensation, but you can be certain it was for the child of someone very wealthy indeed.” Plainly, the courts have no truck with aspirational politicians’ familiar trope promising two babies born next to each other in hospital should have the same life opportunities, regardless of differing social class. Actuaries, hard-headed no-nonsense types, can prove the odds that the baby of a rich banker was destined for a high-earning profession, while the cleaner’s baby had a puny chance of rising up the social ladder in this most socially immobile country. Instead of a system of delays and denials that frustrates grieving families and terrorises doctors as lawyers seek to pin personal blame on someone, the committee proposes a system closer to those used in New Zealand and Scandinavia. An independent administrative body would investigate a patient’s case to see if the harm done was avoidable and if so, to fix fair compensation briskly within six months. The priority would be openness and learning from mistakes to protect future patients. Not needing to find a person to blame makes it easier for patients to get compensation – but the payout would be far lower. Some warn this lower burden of proof would encourage a flood of claims, but New Zealand found a similar system ended up halving the sums paid out. There would still be a recourse to law, but courts would use the same compensation scales. Countries using a similar system find few cases ending up in court. The committee heard from parents who had dragged themselves through years of litigation just to get acknowledgment that an error had been made. One mother said, “The sad truth is that I ‘won’, I was given compensation. All my legal costs were paid, but I felt devastation.” Speedy resolution with a hospital open about everything that happened would have saved her years of agony. Two injured babies in next-door cots will need the same care, even if one can prove negligence, while the other suffered an act of God. A bizarre oddity that vastly inflates compensation costs is that courts assume the child will use private health, not the NHS, all their life. Here’s the big moral issue: money paid out to a few compensation winners is taken from the desperately hard-pressed funds of an NHS trust. This is not like a consumer suing a private company that has insurance. The NHS is all of us, a collective endeavour everyone pays for. The social contract binding us to it is not like a consumer rights contract. There used to be crown immunity for public services, but now accident-chasing lawyers urge people to sue the public realm – or all of us – for such things as slip-and-trip accidents. Lawyers are the main winners, the public the main losers. Above all, the NHS should be immune from these galloping compensation claims that act as obstacles to a rapid correction of faulty medical systems. Reform has been stymied every time it’s been raised in parliament – but then parliament still has more lawyers than any other single profession.

5/3/2022,"The new owner of Morrisons has offered to sell 87 petrol station forecourts in an effort to gain the competition watchdog’s approval for its £7bn takeover of the UK’s fourth largest supermarket. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was “minded to accept” the plan by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, a US private equity firm that owns a string of petrol forecourts, but it would consult on it before making a final ruling. A CMA inquiry found the takeover could lead to a loss of competition and potentially higher petrol prices for drivers in 121 areas. CD&R owns the Motor Fuel Group, the largest independent operator of petrol stations in the UK with 921 sites, while Morrisons operates 339 across England, Scotland and Wales. While the number of petrol stations CD&R is proposing to sell – all of which are Motor Fuel Group sites – is lower than the number of areas where concerns were identified, the CMA said the sale of some forecourts would affected multiple areas. Colin Raftery, the senior director of mergers at the watchdog, said: “The sale of these petrol stations will preserve competition and prevent motorists from losing out due to this deal, which is particularly important when prices have recently hit record highs. If we conclude that the competition issues have been addressed following a consultation on CD&R’s offer, the deal will be cleared.” An agreement would stave off the a full investigation by the CMA that could take more than six months to complete, holding up CD&R’s plans for Morrisons. The private equity firm has said putting Morrisons stores on to Motor Fuel Group forecourts could be an important way to expand the reach of the Bradford-based supermarket. A lengthy investigation would be problematic for Morrisons, which has already warned that profits are likely to take a significant hit this year as the cost of living crisis and disruption because of the war in Ukraine weigh on the grocery market. Morrisons has been losing market share in recent months as inflation across the grocery market has spurred shoppers to turn to discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, while Morrisons’ bigger rivals Sainsbury’s and Tesco have been ploughing millions of pounds into keeping prices down for shoppers. The buyout of Morrisons, which employs about 120,000 staff in the UK across 497 supermarkets as well as factories, farms and a company-owned fishing trawler, will bring the chain into private hands for the first time since the founding family listed it on the stock market in 1967.",News/Business,Morrisons owner offers to sell 87 petrol stations to clear £7bn takeover,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/morrisons-owner-sell-87-petrol-stations-clayton-dubilier-rice
5/3/2022,"Good morning. The US supreme court has provisionally voted to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark ruling that legalised abortion nationwide in America, according to a draft opinion reported on by Politico. In what appeared to be a stunning and unprecedented leak, Politico said on Monday evening it had obtained an initial majority opinion written by justice Samuel Alito and circulated in the court on 10 February. The opinion strikes down Roe v Wade, the court’s 1973 ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion, and a subsequent 1992 decision – Planned Parenthood v Casey – that largely upheld that right. Politico quoted Alito as saying: “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.” The justice adds: “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. It is time to heed the constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.” How have campaigners reacted? The leaked opinion has been described as “horrifying and unprecedented”. Could dismantling Roe v Wade imperil other ‘core, basic human rights’? The decision could potentially affect gay rights, contraceptives and fertility treatments. What will US’s future look like if abortion becomes a crime again? As Roe v Wade faces a direct challenge, criminal defense attorneys, prosecutors, local judges and police begin to lay out what it would look like to criminalize abortion. The European Union was preparing sanctions on Russian oil sales over its invasion of Ukraine after a major shift by Germany, Russia’s biggest energy customer, that could deprive Moscow of a large revenue stream within days. Attempts to increase economic pressure on Russia come amid hopes of more evacuations from the besieged city of Mariupol, while the US said Moscow was preparing to formally annex the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the country’s east. “The reports state that Russia plans to engineer referenda upon joining sometime in mid-May,” said Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe on Monday. He said Russia was considering a similar plan in a third region, Kherson, where Moscow has recently solidified control and imposed use of its rouble currency. The European Commission is expected to propose a sixth package of EU sanctions this week against Russia, including a possible embargo on buying Russian oil. What else is happening? The director of the United Nations World Food Programme in Germany has warned that millions of tonnes of grain is stuck in Ukraine due to sea ports being blocked by Russian military action. What else do we know? Here’s what we know on day 69 of the invasion. Politics – personal, contemporary and historic – were close to the surface on New York’s Upper East Side on Monday night as 600 guests, invited to celebrate America’s Gilded Age at the Met Gala, offered their own interpretation of style and the multitude of meanings dress carries, then as now. The singer Alicia Keys wore a cape celebrating New York union history. New York’s mayor, Eric Adams, who had said he’d been “dying to go” to the fundraiser “for years”, arrived on the red carpet wearing a jacket with decorative forearms and lapels that paid homage to the city’s transit system. The back of his coat read “End Gun Violence” in red lettering. The former secretary of state Hillary Clinton came in a dress inspired by friendship quilts inscribed with the names, she explained, of “gutsy women” of the 19th- and 20th-century liberation movements. Politics at the event returned again when Kim Kardashian appeared on the red carpet in the iconic dress Marilyn Monroe wore to coo Happy Birthday to President Kennedy in 1962. What did people wear? Here’s a gallery of pictures from the red carpet. A week after Elon Musk finalized a $44bn deal to purchase Twitter, the billionaire is working to secure outside funding for the acquisition that would tie up less of his personal fortune. Musk is in talks with large investment firms and high net-worth individuals to take on more financing.

Six people are under investigation in Shanghai after an elderly nursing home resident was mistakenly declared dead, put in a body bag and taken by coroners to a waiting van before mortuary workers noticed they were still alive. The incident was filmed by onlookers and footage quickly spread online. The ousted Myanmar leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has gone on trial in a new corruption case against her, alleging she took $550,000 in bribes from a construction magnate. She is charged with two counts under the country’s Anti-Corruption Act, with each count punishable by up to 15 years in prison. The largest active wildfire in the US has forced thousands from their homes in New Mexico, as unusually fast-spreading blazes dot the drought-stricken south-west. The blaze, dubbed the Calf Canyon fire, has consumed more than 121,000 acres (49,000 hectares), or more than half the area of New York City, tearing through centuries-old settlements and vacation homes in forested mountains 30 miles (48km) north-east of Santa Fe. “I feel good,” a ludicrously youthful Graham Nash tells Simon Hattenstone. “Eighty years old and still rocking.” And some.

5/3/2022,"Plans to include an overflight of Hebron in the occupied West Bank in Israel’s annual independence day airshow have been met with angry responses from Palestinians and leftwing Israelis. The Israel air force said on its website at the weekend that the controversial overflight sought by settler leaders would take place on Thursday. The decision puts an end to uncertainty over the display after an initial announcement was taken down amid criticism from Mossi Raz, a legislator in the leftwing Meretz party, which is part of the ruling coalition, who termed it “a provocative show of force and superiority”. The decision comes as about 1,000 Hebron settlers, viewed as including some of the most militant Israelis in the West Bank, make plans to expand their heavily guarded enclaves in Hebron, a city of roughly 200,000 Palestinians. “This is a kind of annexation of Hebron to the Israeli state,” said the Palestinian activist Issa Amro, the head of the Friends of Hebron organisation that opposes Israeli settlement in the flashpoint city. “This is a provocation of our feelings.” Palestinians will be doing anything but celebrating Israeli independence. They view that as the Nakba (catastrophe) when about 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled in the war surrounding Israel’s creation. “Instead of apologising for the Nakba, they continue to show us more signs they want the Palestinians to leave their homes,” Amro said. Ori Givati, spokesperson for Breaking the Silence, a group of anti-occupation Israeli military veterans, also criticised the planned overflight, saying it would “represent another step in the de facto annexation” of the occupied Palestinian territories. “It is hard to ignore the irony of an Israeli independence flyover over the heads of a people to whom Israel has denied independence for 55 years,” Givati said. But as has often been the case with the hard-right prime minister Naftali Bennett’s coalition, the views of the left were disregarded in favour of those of the settlers and their allies. The planes are slated to fly over the Cave of the Patriarchs, a site where Jewish tradition holds that biblical patriarchs and matriarchs are buried. The same site is holy to Muslims as the Ibrahimi mosque. Yigal Dilmoni, the CEO of the Yesha Council, the umbrella group for settlers in the West Bank, hailed the decision. “There is symbolism that the flight of the air force on independence day, which symbolises the return of the nation of Israel to the land of Israel, passes over Hebron and the Cave of the Patriarchs. This is a symbolic matter of values and ideals.” Eliyahu Liebman, the mayor for Jewish settlers in Hebron and neighbouring Kiryat Arba, said a wrong was being righted. “This says that we are gaining equality and being treated like any other citizen of the state of Israel in all matters including the flyover which will go over our houses and not just certain cities,” he said Liebman added that every year, local residents and officials had impressed upon authorities that being included in the overflight was “very, very, very important” to them and that this year they finally got a positive response. The overflight route will also include the south Hebron hills, where settlers are known for their violence towards Palestinians and Israeli solidarity activists. Israeli army plans call for the eviction of about 4,000 Palestinians from 30 farming hamlets in the vicinity to make way for a training area. The matter is awaiting a verdict by Israel’s supreme court. The Hebron settlers count anti-Arab extremists in their ranks, including the far-right opposition MP Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has advocated for the expulsion of Arab citizens of Israel deemed to be disloyal to the state. But in recent years there has been a process of mainstreaming the Hebron settlers. President Isaac Herzog visited the Cave of the Patriarchs in November, declaring that recognition of Jewish ties to the site “must be beyond all controversy”.",News/World news,Israel independence day overflight decried by Palestinians and left,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/israel-independence-day-overflight-decried-by-palestinians-and-left
5/3/2022,"The Catalan government is to introduce a law to protect historic businesses as soaring rents and the pandemic have forced many of the region’s landmark shops and bars to close. Shopfronts and other details that are more than 100 years old are already protected but the pioneering legislation goes further, with shop owners in listed premises having to ask permission if they want to change its commercial activity. In short, if a patisserie closes it will ideally reopen as a patisserie. “What we need to do is to protect the non-material heritage,” said Sònia Hernández, the Catalan government’s director general of cultural heritage. “The existing law doesn’t protect things that people now believe we need to protect. The facade and the interior of some buildings are protected already; now we want to protect the activity as well,.” The aim is partly to prevent a repeat of what happened to Colmado Quílez, a much-loved grocery store that had stood on La Rambla de Catalunya since 1908 and was forced to close in 2014 when faced with a 700% rent increase. The signage has been preserved but the window display of wine and conserves has been replaced with expensive suits, obliterating the shop’s essential character. Some historic businesses struggle on, such as Casa Beethoven on La Rambla, which has sold music scores since 1883 and is now an outlier among the bars and souvenir shops that dominate the city’s most famous street. It only survives because it has a low fixed rent. Further up La Rambla, the Musical Emporium, which sold sheet music and instruments for 114 years, is now a bureau de change, and Camiseria Xancó, a purveyor of shirts and underwear for 203 years, succumbed to the pandemic. Rent rises forced the closure of Herboristeria del Rei, which had been selling herbal remedies since 1818 and was appointed herbalist to the Spanish royal family in 1857. Others at risk in Barcelona city centre are Xarcuteria La Pineda and the glove and fan shop Guantería Alonso, relics of the city’s history in a sea of chain stores. Hernández accepts that as things stand the government cannot stop landlords raising the rent, but believes a growing awareness that there is more to conservation than a handpainted sign may help to conserve what remains of Catalonia’s commercial heritage.",News/World news,Catalonia plans law to protect historic shops as rents soar,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/catalonia-plans-law-to-protect-historic-shops-as-rents-soar
5/3/2022,"Keir Starmer has accused the Conservatives of “mud-slinging” over allegations he broke lockdown rules after a photograph emerged of him drinking a beer with staff in a constituency office last year. Asked if there had been any contact from Durham police in recent weeks, the Labour leader told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The police looked at this months ago and came to a clear conclusion that was ‘no rules were broken’, and that’s because no rules were broken.” Starmer said: “We were working in the office, it was just before elections, we were busy, we paused for food … there was no party, no rules were broken, that is the long and the short of it.” He added that “all that has happened in the past week is that with local elections on the horizon, Conservative MPs have decided to chuck mud”. But when asked repeatedly specifically whether there was contact between himself and Durham constabulary, Starmer did not confirm whether this was the case or not, but instead repeated that “no rules were broken”. Footage emerged of the Labour leader drinking a beer with colleagues in April 2021 while coronavirus restrictions were in place. In February, Durham police confirmed they did not believe any offence had been committed. A spokesperson for the force had said: “Durham constabulary has reviewed video footage recorded in Durham on 30 April 2021. We do not believe an offence has been established in relation to the legislation and guidance in place at that time and will therefore take no further action in relation to this matter.” Speaking on Sky News, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international trade secretary, said officers should revisit the allegation, adding that if the police “consider a fixed penalty notice should be issued then clearly that would be the tool available to them to do so”. Regarding the allegation, she said: “I understand that there is some work ongoing and I would absolutely encourage them to look at it.” She added: “I’d like Durham constabulary to look at everything and to – if they felt a fixed penalty notice was the appropriate statement of conclusion of it in the same way the Metropolitan police have here for a number of people who were in Downing Street at events that had been deemed unsuitable – then what I would want to see is that same fixed penalty notice.”",News/Politics,Keir Starmer accuses Tories of ‘mud-slinging’ over lockdown beer photo,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/03/keir-starmer-accuses-tories-mud-slinging-labour-lockdown-beer-photo
