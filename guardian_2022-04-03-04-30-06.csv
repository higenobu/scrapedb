4/3/2022,"A Republican Senate candidate in Georgia said for years that he graduated in the top 1% of his university’s class – but actually never graduated college at all. Herschel Walker, a former pro football player who is running as a Republican in Georgia’s US Senateprimary, has publicly stated multiple times that he graduated in the top 1% of his class at University of Georgia despite never completing his degree. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) first reported on Walker lying about his college degree in December 2021. Walker later deleted the claim from his campaign website and released a statement to AJC acknowledging that he never graduated. “I was majoring in Criminal Justice at [University of Georgia] when I left to play in the [United States Football League] my junior year,” said Walker in his statement. “After playing with the New Jersey Generals, I returned to Athens to complete my degree, but life and football got in the way.” But Walker has actually been misrepresenting his academic achievements for years in interviews and motivational speeches, as recently as 2017, according to an investigation by CNN. In a speech from that year, Walker said: “And all of sudden I started going to the library, getting books, standing in front of a mirror reading to myself. So that Herschel, that all the kids said was retarded, become valedictorian of his class. Graduated University of Georgia in the top 1% of his class.” Walker repeated those claims in a 2017 interview with Sirius XM radio: “I also was valedictorian of my class. I also was in the top 1% of my graduating class of college.” Walker never received a diploma from the University of Georgia. After maintaining a B average throughout college, as reported by the Christian-Science Monitor and the New York Times, Walker left to play professional football and never completed his degree. Walker’s campaign was not able to provide proof that he graduated from the University of Georgia to CNN, but did defend his athletic record. CNN found that Walker also repeated false claims about his academic achievements in high school. Walker has said on multiple occasions that he was valedictorian of his high school class. While Walker was a top student in his high school with an A average, CNN did not find proof that Walker was ever named valedictorian. CNN also found no evidence that his high school even named a valedictorian or salutatorian until 1994, after Walker had graduated. Walker’s campaign could not verify that Walker was his high school valedictorian, but did provide comment on Walker overstating his high school achievements to CNN. “There is not a single voter in Georgia who believes that whether Herschel graduated at the ‘top of his class’ or as valedictorian 40 years ago has any bearing on his ability to be a great United States senator,” said Mallory Blount, communications director for the campaign, in a statement. Walker has remained a contentious primary candidate, with some Georgia Republicans doubting he can win the GOP primary due to his personal baggage, reported Salon. Walker has admitted to past violent behavior against his ex-wife Cindy Grossman and faces other accusations of violence against women from incidents in 2002 and in 2012, which Walker denies. Grossman has publicly detailed domestic violence she suffered from Walker during their relationship. In divorce filings, Grossman said that Walker was physically abusive towards her, forcing her to obtain a protective order against him. In 2008 interview with ABC, Grossman also said that Walker pointed a gun at her head and threatened to kill her. Walker has spoken about his history with violence in an exclusive 2021 interview with Axios, saying that he is “accountable” to his past actions against Grossman and has pursued therapy to treat his mental health problems. Walker, who was endorsed by former president Donald Trump, is the expected Republican nominee against the Democratic senator Raphael Warnock in November.",News/US news,Republican Senate hopeful overstated academic achievements for years,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/02/herschel-walker-republican-senate-overstated-academic-achievements-for-years
4/3/2022,"Halyna Tovkach, 55, is searching for the body of her husband, Oleg, 62. His death, she says, is part of a war crime in which Russian soldiers also killed two young boys and their mother. The incident is said to have happened at 7.15 on the morning of 5 March in Bucha, a town north-west of Kyiv, when two families who were neighbours on Ivana Rudenka street tried to escape their hell. It is, Halyna said, a story she wants the world to hear. The two families, terrified by the constant shelling and indiscriminate fire that has marked the Russian invasion of Ukraine, had decided to leave Bucha, a town of about 30,000 people, just days earlier. Food and drink was packed, a route to the western Ukrainian village of Romanivka was planned. They would travel in convoy. In the front car, a white Ford, were Oleksandr Chykmariov, 42, his wife, Margarita, 33, and their two boys, Matvey, eight and Klim, four. Behind them, in a white Dodge, were Oleg, his wife, Halyna, who would drive the whole way as her husband did not have a licence, and Tetiana Kovalenko, 50, mother of the wife of their son, Roman, 33. The two families were nervous but determined. They were destined never to even reach the outskirts of town. After turning on to Chkalova Street, just 800 metres from their doorstep, a Russian armoured vehicle, unseen by those in the second car, got the convoy in its sights, according to Halyna’s account to the Observer from her hospital bed. “The Chykmariovs’ car suddenly stopped and so I stopped,” said Halyna. “I saw a door open in the front car and two legs drop out. A thought came to my head, I just thought everybody is killed. It happened so quickly, I don’t know. My husband screamed, ‘turn round, turn round’. Then I felt something hit my right shoulder, a bullet. I pushed my husband to get out of the car. But he wasn’t moving. I realised he was dead. I just opened my door and ran.” Tetiana, in the back seat, couldn’t get out and had to smash her window open with her feet to escape. In the front car, which a short while later was consumed by flames, only Oleksandr survived the attack. His wife and two boys had been killed instantly by the machine-gun fire that raked the vehicle. Oleksandr crawled out of his shattered vehicle taking cover behind Halyna’s car. He reached into the front seat of the Dodge after spotting a mobile phone. “He called me,” said Roman. “He said, ‘Everyone’s dead. Your mother and father are dead.’” Oleksandr, who has since lost a leg, was later picked up by passing car. He was not ready to talk about the death of his family when approached by the Observer. Roman, who had been away on business when Vladimir Putin had begun his war on 24 February, says he will return to Bucha to find his father in a couple of days. Oleg’s body, locals say, stayed in the car for five days. The Russians would not allow it to be removed. “I don’t know where my father’s body is,” Roman said. “I have to find him.” His mother is still in hospital after being moved from a local facility to Chernobyl. “The doctors said that one centimetre lower and I would be dead too,” Halyna said. “I saw a V on the armoured vehicle,” she added, referring to the letter that, along with Z, has been painted on Russian vehicles operating in Ukraine. The understated manner in which Roman and his mother tell their dreadful story belies the strength of their determination that accounts of such crimes will be heard. “I hope this will be of interest to you,” Roman says. “It is a war crime.” The claims could not be independently verified although the Observer has seen a photograph of Halyna’s wounds and they echo a terrible list of similar stories that have emerged as the Russian troops have been driven back from Kyiv’s suburbs. On Saturday, the bodies of at least 20 men were found by Ukrainian forces lying in a single street in Bucha. One of them had his hands tied. Sixteen of the 20 corpses were lying either on the pavement or by the verge, according to an account by AFP journalists who had been given access to the town by the military. Three were sprawled in the middle of the road and another was lying in the courtyard of a house, according to the account. An open Ukrainian passport lay on the ground next to the person who had his hands tied behind his back with a piece of white cloth. All were said to be wearing civilian clothes – winter coats, jackets or tracksuit tops, jeans or jogging bottoms, and trainers or boots. Two of them lay near bicycles while another was next to an abandoned car. Some were said to be laid face up, with their limbs unnaturally bent, while others were lying face down. The faces of the dead had taken on a pale waxy appearance, indicating that they may have been there for a number of days.",News/World news,‘It is a war crime’: two young boys among neighbours shot dead during attempted evacuation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/i-realised-my-husband-was-dead-ukrainians-tell-of-russian-army-atrocities
4/3/2022,"My favourite wild place is right where I live, on the windswept foothills of the St Arnaud Range. I moved here 20 years ago, knowing no one. But the property offered everything I was looking for: native forest, two streams, paddocks for my alpacas, and a large area of wetland and alpine tussock. If you walk up to the top of the drive through the forest, listening to the calls of tuis and korimako on the way, or bush robins, fantails and kaka, you find stunning views of the St Arnaud Range. But they don’t match the views to be had if you trudge up towards the back of the property. Here you can see mountains in all directions. It’s spectacular. At night, with no street lights, the stars are dazzling. I can’t see another house from mine. As the property has grown wilder more and more birds have made their home here. I know spring is on its way when I hear the first call of the kotare, the native kingfisher, followed soon after by the welcome swallows arriving back from overwintering in the lowlands. Later the shining cuckoo will arrive from the Pacific Islands. Why fly all the way here, I wonder. But I don’t complain. They love it here and so do I.Cathie Harrison My favourite wild place is the fur seal colony at Ngawi. The kekeno (NZ fur seals) live on a rocky bulge of the coastline. The road is windy and narrow and a little perilous, including a short ford which might be unsuitable for smaller vehicle after a lot of rain. It is better to be the passenger, watching not the ocean but the patch of grass between the rocky shoreline and the road. The kekeno are like a mirage. You’ll think you’re seeing large boulders, then your eyes shift and the seals reveal themselves, stretched in the sun. DOC’s advice is to not get between a seal and the sea. They appear clumsy on land, deceptively fast. The last time I was in Ngawi we watched a young seal crying for its mama, who’d respond from somewhere deeper in the large rocky formation. Spying them in the ocean can be tricky. They’ll dive beneath the waves and resurface a much farther distance away than you’d think. Their thick coats keep out the cold of the ocean. NZ’s east coast feels like it comes straight off Antarctica – so it’s no surprise they’re sunbathing every chance they get.Grace Tong Twenty years ago, someone said the dune was the largest in the southern hemisphere, who knows if it’s true, who cares. You have believed it ever since. Bordered by an estuary and the Pacific Ocean, it looks to be a mountain of sand 100 metres high. It is across the way from Mangawhai, an hour or so north of Auckland. It is a presence you can’t ignore. The wind can be cruel up there. The climb up the sandy face can be agony. Short agony maybe but still the lungs scream and the quads burn. And when you get to the top it’s only to take a break and catch your breath before the descent, the run or fall back down. Often a mixture of both. As a kid, when you wrestled near the edge there was a touch of desperation you didn’t get down below. As a teen, you learned a little more about the way things worked, about how things went wrong. For instance, one day you threw yourself down on a boogie board and instead of flying away, you went mouth open, head first, into the hot sand. Too late, you realised that years of use had rubbed the boogie board’s skin completely away. Later there was romance up there, too. And jealousy. From miles around you could see the little black ants that meant others, strangers, were on that beautiful mountain of sand. So you rushed up. You followed their footsteps. You reached the top and the ground below you shifted a little. Collapsed a little. You couldn’t really see the changes but you knew it was happening. Sand was always being blown in one direction or another, washed away. You were told it was stolen for beaches in Auckland, by ships out at sea. No doubt the dune has changed over the years, but what hasn’t changed is that it continues to seem otherworldly, the shining white gold still catches your eye from all over.James Pasley Kakanui river mouth is where I’d like my ashes to be thrown. Between the 60s and 80s we had a crib in Stirling St, just up from it, next to our grandparents’ crib. Staying there every January was a must, even though it was quite a hike from our home town in Invercargill. We swam, jumped off our grandad’s rowing boat, fished for flounders at night and if it was the September holidays, we’d visit the whitebaiters to check their spoils. The best part of staying in Kakanui in a different school holidays was noticing the sky cloud formations, colour of the sea or the smell and feel of the air of that season. The river mouth often looked different due to storms or king tides and many times we watched the sunrise or sunset from the large rock just south of the river mouth. My sister was living there with her children until recently but we five siblings and families will still meet up there in the future no doubt.Brenda Hamer I recognised Theatre Flat in Aspiring national park as a kindred spirit from my first visit. I was a final year medical student savouring my last ever holiday and was trotting behind three affable men from Southland. After teetering along the high route from Mt Nereus, we had followed the turquoise Rockburn’s waters, and behold, like a sunlight splashed picnic blanket, below us was Theatre Flat’s horizontal oasis of tussock, beech trees and boulders as big as bedrooms. Adding to the drama, the peaks on all sides were named after Greek gods. We climbed the smooth slaps of Amphion and the next day before we left, I stood on a rock in the middle of the Rockburn and sang ‘Worship his Majesty’ in praise of this perfect place. Two decades and four children later I made it to Theatre flat a second time with seasoned climbing friends, Jane and Rosie. After years, we had finally escaped, leaving children with husbands to enjoy a spell in the wild. On my third visit to the thespian flat, just weeks before the Covid lockdown, I bounded confidently down from Park Pass, Leki poles, twin 20-year old daughters and three others trailing behind. I led the crew straight to Theatre Flat boulder where you camp. I led them up mossy slopes (how steep and slippery and sketchy it all seemed this time) to Amphion where you look over to Lake Unknown. I showed them the rock where you stand and sing praise and the next morning we reverently watched whio (the enigmatic whistling alpine ducks of New Zealand) skittering in the chuckling Rockburn. Of great consolation to me is that Theatre Flat continues oblivious to this pandemic and resolutely itself.Kaaren Mathias",Opinion/Opinion,Giant sand dunes and whistling ducks: NZ readers’ favourite wild places,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/03/giant-sand-dunes-and-whistling-ducks-nz-readers-favourite-wild-places
4/3/2022,"The biggest obstacle to Pep Guardiola winning another Champions League, it is widely accepted, is Pep Guardiola. There cannot be a Manchester City knockout tie in the Champions League without talk of his tendency to overthink. The most dramatic moment of last season’s final came when the lineups were released an hour before kick-off and neither Rodri nor Fernandinho were included. It’s what elevates Guardiola above the throng: he is not merely a great manager, but also a flawed hero: he is Faustus, he is Oedipus, he is Charles Foster Kane. It didn’t used to be like that. He used to win Champions Leagues. When his Barcelona beat Manchester United in the 2009 and 2011 finals, there was no trickery beyond switching Samuel Eto’o and Lionel Messi a few minutes into the game in Rome. His side went out with swagger and outplayed United as they had been outplaying opponents all season. It’s only more recently – the four midfielders away to Liverpool in the 2018 quarter-final, adopting a back three against Lyon in the 2020 quarter-final, the absence of a holding midfielder against Chelsea in last season’s final – that the mysterious tweaks have become a habit. This perhaps is the flip side of experience. He knows what can go wrong, but in trying to avert that ends up disrupting the structures and systems that make his side great, the strengths that are why they should win. That is why it matters City face Atlético Madrid on Tuesday in the first leg of this season’s quarter‑final. Because of all the defeats Guardiola has suffered in the Champions League, none haunts him as much as Bayern’s semi-final elimination against Atlético in 2016, none made him more determined to, as far as possible, take chance out of the game. Guardiola had left out Thomas Müller for the first leg, in Spain, a decision that provoked consternation and, perhaps, increased the pressure. Bayern went 1-0 down early to a superb Saúl Ñíguez goal but were probably the better side until, with 20 minutes remaining, Guardiola removed Thiago Alcântara for Müller. Bayern lost momentum and ceded the midfield and, with Fernando Torres hitting the post, they were slightly fortunate to get away with a 1-0 defeat. This was it. Bayern were closing in on their third straight Bundesliga title under Guardiola, but they always won the Bundesliga – doing it with greater verve or tactical control meant little. They had lost in the Champions League semi-final in the two previous seasons: unpicked on the break by Carlo Ancelotti’s Real Madrid in 2014 and blown away in the first leg by Luis Enrique’s Barcelona in 2015. Guardiola’s legacy rested on this: lose and there would be an inevitable sense of anticlimax. He knew this was a direct examination of him and his ideals – because so few other managers construct a side so thoroughly in their own image, and because Diego Simeone’s vision of football is so directly contrary to that. Guardiola identified a vulnerability between Filipe Luís, Atlético’s left-back, and Stefan Savic, the left-sided centre-back. That channel was usually protected by Koke but Guardiola believed Philipp Lahm could be used to draw him away, creating opportunities for Müller. He also suspected that Atlético, although they would settle back into their familiar low block, would press hard from the start to try to pinch an early away goal, so resolved to go long to Robert Lewandowski, switching to a more familiar possession-based game when Atlético dropped off. He was right. His plan nearly worked. It should have worked. A Xabi Alonso free-kick gave Bayern the lead before half-time and Müller missed a penalty soon after. But nine minutes into the second half, Atlético caught them on the break, Torres playing in Antoine Griezmann to equalise. Lewandowski levelled the aggregate scores with 16 minutes left and Torres missed a penalty but Atlético went through on away goals. Bayern had 73% possession in the second leg, 33 shots to Atlético’s seven. They had the better of all but about 25 minutes of the 180 and scored as many goals as Atlético. And they were out. It had happened to Guardiola before. His Barcelona had lost implausibly to Internazionale and Chelsea in semi‑finals in 2010 and 2012. But here was another level of disappointment and frustration. How could it keep happening? At that point, Guardiola had suffered five Champions League eliminations. Bayern’s defeat to Barcelona in 2015 was readily explicable: Barça were the better side, Guardiola gambled on surprising and unsettling them by pressing high and operating a back three in the Camp Nou and it didn’t work. But in the other four, his team had been undone on the break, three times after being almost laughably dominant. Guardiola teams press high. They leave space behind them. It is a vulnerability in the method: to call it a flaw is misleading because it is what makes them great – and in football no blanket is ever big enough. It may be that better sides are less intimidated by the high press, are better able to exploit that vulnerability. It’s understandable that Guardiola should seek to mitigate the danger. For a coach as interventionist as Guardiola, it must be very difficult just to write off defeats as being down to misfortune. Imagine the alternative: imagine the mockery if he just kept sending out his sides with the same approach and they kept being caught on the counter. But it is hard to believe that if those semi-finals of 2010, 2012 and 2016 were played multiple times, Guardiola would not win most, that his recent attempts to counter the counter, those odd selections against Liverpool, Lyon and Chelsea, have not become counter-productive. Now Atlético again, so that for the first time since 2016 Guardiola will come face to face with the team that has provoked such doubt. This is not a great Atlético. From a purely footballing point of view, City should win relatively easily. But this is not purely about football. For Guardiola, it’s an enormous psychological test.",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola comes face to face again with the team that provoked his doubts | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/02/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-atletico-madrid-diego-simeone-champions-league
4/3/2022,"The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is facing a growing Tory revolt over economic policy and his handling of the cost of living crisis, as senior Conservatives warn that high taxes will fatally undermine their party’s appeal to voters at the next general election. Former Tory cabinet minister David Davis said on Saturday that if the Conservatives were to become known as the party of high taxes, the damage to their economic reputation would be as deep and lasting as that inflicted on John Major’s government by the disaster of Black Wednesday in September 1992. Davis told the Observer that with the country now operating with the highest overall tax burden for decades, the electoral dangers were clear. “Acquiring a reputation for being the high-tax party will do every bit as much damage to the Conservative Party as the ERM crisis did to us in the 1990s,” Davis said. The UK’s chaotic and costly exit from the EU’s exchange rate mechanism scarred the Major government’s reputation for economic management and put it on course for the crushing defeat by New Labour in 1997. Last week a poll for the LabourList website caused deep concern among Tory MPs, as it found the Conservatives were already seen as the party of high taxation by more voters (39%) than had that view of Labour (27%). Asked which they regarded as the party of low taxation, 30% named Labour and 27% cited the Tories in the Savanta ComRes survey. Even after offering some limited tax reductions in last month’s spring statement, as Sunak tried to ease the effects of the cost-of-living crisis, the overall burden of taxation in the UK is still at it highest since the 1950s, when the country was rebuilding after the second world war. Sunak, who is reportedly heading to California for a holiday over Easter, used his spring statement to cut fuel duty by 5p a litre and announced that the threshold at which people start paying national insurance would rise from £9,568 to £12,750 in July. While insisting he was wedded to low taxes he decided, however, to hold back most of an estimated £20bn war chest received from extra tax receipts resulting from inflation for pre-election tax cuts. In a highly unusual move he promised a reduction in the basic rate of income tax from 20p to 19p – but not until 2024. Many Tory MPs believe he should bring forward tax cuts now in order to boost growth, and that it will be too late to pose as a tax-cutting chancellor in 2024. Others have criticised him for failing to do enough to support low-earners and those on benefits. On Saturday, as protests about the cost of living were held across the country, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said that rather than keeping taxes high to control the deficit, Sunak should stimulate economic growth by lowering them, and at the same time offer more help to people on universal credit by increasing the amount they can earn before their benefits are reduced. Warning against keeping taxes high, and the risk of stagflation – low growth and rising inflation – Duncan Smith said: “Fiscal squeezing is a disaster at this time and we shouldn’t do it. Cutting the deficit will actually add to the problem of stagflation.” The veteran Tory MP Peter Bone said the chancellor had to act now to cut taxes, or risk a repeat of the 1990s when voters formed a fixed opinion of a lack of Tory economic competence that proved impossible to shift before the 1997 general election. “John Major got the economy back on track [after the ERM debacle] but the electorate had made up its mind well before that and thought, ‘we will give the other guys a chance’. We have still got time to get this right but we need to do this now. We need to correct course now.” New analysis by the Resolution Foundation of tax measures taken by Sunak finds that they will raise £14bn over the course of the financial year. Shadow chief secretary to the treasury Pat McFadden said: “The Tories have become the party of high taxation because they are the party of low economic growth. The Tory government is alone among G7 countries in increasing taxes on income this year.” Labour is proposing a targeted windfall tax on the profits of North Sea oil and gas companies to help families with their energy bills, and has consistently opposed Sunak’s rise in national insurance contributions. There is also pressure from elsewhere for private companies to offer help. A study of payments to shareholders made by the “big six” energy suppliers shows dividends and share buybacks amounted to £43.5bn over the past decade. The thinktank Common Wealth, which carried out the research, said the suppliers – Centrica, EDF, E.ON and its subsidiary nPower, Scottish Power and Scottish & Southern (SSE) – were in a healthy financial position and could afford to offset some of the soaring cost of electricity and gas faced by their customers. Meanwhile increasing pressure is being felt by food banks as people struggle to make ends meet and resort to increasingly desperate measures to keep warm and feed their families. Gerard Woodhouse, a local Labour councillor who runs the L6 Community Centre in Everton, Liverpool, said the food bank and food union that the charity runs were opening six days a week rather than four due to increased demand, but at the same time had seen a reduction in donations in recent days because “people who used to donate now need help themselves”.“Shops are donating potatoes, leeks, cabbages, but I can’t get rid of them. They’re getting handed back to me because people are saying, ‘It costs too much to cook,’” he said.In other cases, “People are getting into bed at 6pm so they haven’t got to put the heating on or use any electricity. The number of people asking for thicker quilts is crazy. If I had 200 this week they’d have gone,” he said. “You hear about the poor times in the Thirties. Those stories are now happening today. It’s just going to get worse and worse.”   ",News/Business,Tories fear poll disaster over high taxes,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/02/tories-fear-poll-disaster-over-high-taxes
4/3/2022,"Wales’s decision to give their top dozen women professional contracts at the turn of the year is already bearing fruit. After their rousing comeback victory in Dublin last weekend Siwan Lillicrap’s rejuvenated side moved to second in the Six Nations table with a breathless win over a Scottish side who simply refused to give in. Wales know the real test lies ahead when they face England at Kingsholm next Saturday, but after a first home Six Nations win for three years the revolution is up and running. The replacement scrum-half Ffion Lewis only settled the game in the dying minutes and Lillicrap and Alisha Butchers were outstanding in the back row as Wales recovered from a nerve-shredding first half in which they were forced on the back foot against a Scottish side humbled themselves by England a week earlier. Scotland drew first blood when their hooker Lana Skeldon celebrated her 50th cap by burrowing over the line after Sarah Bonar won a lineout. All the early pressure came from the visitors, who were playing with plenty of ambition. Wales struggled for possession and territory in the first quarter but they eventually got a foothold in the game. The hooker Carys Phillips forced her way over after a surge by the Welsh pack from a lineout. Scotland had competed pretty well with the English scrum a week earlier but Wales’s pack began to turn on the power. Scotland, though, were playing most of the rugby and after a multi-phase move the scrum-half Jenny Maxwell hoisted a hopeful kick to the corner and Rhona Lloyd took advantage of a wicked bounce on the Arms Park artificial pitch to outfox two defenders for Scotland’s second try. The visitors butchered a chance at a third try when they spurned a three-player overlap but Wales continued to concede penalty after penalty and the first half finished horribly when Kerin Lake was shown a yellow card by the referee Joy Neville for flopping over the ball to prevent quick release by the Scottish pack. A player short, things soon got worse for Wales after the break when Lloyd dived over in the corner for a second try. But Wales’s reaction was instant. The replacement Sioned Harries, on the field for only a couple of minutes, emerged from beneath a pile of bodies to claim the try and Wales were back in the match. Scotland, now facing 15 opponents again, began to make mistakes as Wales, ears no doubt still ringing from coach Ioan Cunningham’s half-time talk, began to turn up the heat. The Welsh pack powered forwards in a series of scrums and Neville showed another yellow card to the prop Leah Bartlett for collapsing the fourth of them. Wales spurned another scrum opportunity for a lineout and the replacement Kelsey Jones was driven over to level the scores once more. Five minutes remained when Butchers broke off the back of a scrum to give Lewis the chance to run in the winning try from 30 metres out. Even then Scotland refused to buckle. The game ended with them on the Welsh line and Lillicrap was slightly fortunate to stay on the field when her left hand nudged at a Scottish pass. Wales clung on.

4/3/2022,"Three points were required and only one was claimed by Manchester United whose prospects of Champions League qualification are distant following this outing. Ralf Rangnick’s side are sixth, a win behind Arsenal, who have played two games fewer. It could have been worse. With 10 minutes left Raphaël Varane got himself into a pickle, Kelechi Iheanacho burgled him and passed to James Maddison who finished to make it 2-1. But Andre Marriner, on a VAR touchline review, deemed Iheanacho impeded Varane and it was chalked off. Though United rallied from here – Jadon Sancho missed a golden late chance – their campaign’s end is proving as dismal as what came before. Rangnick wanted the last two and a half weeks since United’s previous action – being dumped out of the Champions League by Atlético Madrid – to be a ‘reset’ for the season’s final nine games. There was no such chance, though, for Marcus Rashford who, despite the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo (flu) and Edinson Cavani (injury), was not selected. When the 24-year-old’s freshness due to having a clear international fortnight was factored in it was a stark statement of how far the local boy has fallen. Ronaldo was the big miss: the hat-trick hero of a 3-2 win over Tottenham in the previous league outing was struck down on Friday so Rangnick did a Pep Guardiola, plumping for a false No 9 in Bruno Fernandes. The Portuguese’s first act featured a puzzled look at Paul Pogba when the latter failed to drift into the space behind Leicester he tapped the ball into. If the Frenchman can often bemuse, there was only clarity regarding Harry Maguire and the support offered the beleaguered defender from the United fans, after he endured boos on England duty. Fred was name-checked by Rangnick as another United player who divides opinion like the captain. Bright in patches, when he ceded possession and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall flipped defence into an attack that had Harvey Barnes shooting. This was the Brazilian in microcosm. Flying United’s homegrown flag as this year’s breakthrough academy product is Anthony Elanga. He possesses pace and ruthlessness before goal and when approaching the danger area: a cross that invited Scott McTominay to head past Kasper Schmeichel and a surge that took out James Justin before Wesley Fofana did the same to the 19-year-old were illustrations of each quality. Rangnick’s ploy was for Fred, Elanga and Pogba to flood forward in support of Fernandes and all did as United surged at their visitors. Pogba, almost a second ‘ghost nine’, was present to head Luke Shaw’s ball at goal and while easy for Schmeichel to clutch this indicated that, so far, the absence of Ronaldo and Cavani was not a problem. Further encouragement came when Fernandes was akin to a striker in racing on to Fred’s threaded pass – from an errant Fofana touch – before toe-poking a shot Schmeichel did admirably to keep out. From this, Leicester broke quickly and Diogo Dalot and Varane just about kept Barnes at bay. A further scare came when United’s defence and midfield were splayed and Iheanacho sprayed wide when David de Gea should have been tested. Then, a Maddison-Barnes combination had the latter firing: again it was off-target, again United had been warned. If an unwanted torpor was settling on Rangnick’s men the way McTominay took Maddison out suggested he would shake it. But, this was dangerous and he was fortunate Marriner deemed it only worthy of yellow. Ten minutes into the second half and the German went into proactive mode: on came Rashford, off went McTominay and United had a natural spearhead, Rashford showing his value with a run along the right that forced a corner. In the race for a top-four finish a draw was not what United required and things took a turn for the worse as they undid themselves. Fred broke from a Leicester corner but when passing to Fernandes Dewsbury-Hall snatched possession and fed Maddison along the left. He crossed and Varane missed a header but Iheanacho did not, De Gea able only to palm the diving finish in. This disaster for United, though, was soon eased by a close-to-instant equaliser. This time Schmeichel was chief culprit – his fluffed clearance was pinged by Varane to Fred who relayed to Fernandes: when he pulled the trigger and Schmeichel parried, Fred smashed home. Next, in a breathless passage, De Gea flew to his right to save a Fofana header to make a scintillating save. Then came Maddison’s goal-that-never was and United then dominated. But to no avail.",Sport/Football,Manchester United escape with draw after VAR thwarts Leicester’s Maddison,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/02/manchester-united-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report
4/3/2022,"A Tory MP was suspended from the parliamentary party on Saturday after a series of allegations relating to sexual harassment and cocaine use. The party has removed the whip from David Warburton, the Conservative MP for Somerton and Frome, who is understood to be facing allegations from three women, while a photo has emerged of the MP allegedly sitting alongside lines of cocaine. The picture of Warburton, published by the Sunday Times, is said to date from February. It is claimed it was taken at the home of a younger woman who he met through politics. Accusations from two other women have been handed to the new parliamentary harassment watchdog, the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). A spokesperson on behalf of the whips’ office said: “David Warburton MP has had the Conservative party whip removed while the investigation is ongoing.” Warburton, 56, is a married father of two and former businessman. It is alleged by the Sunday Times that he asked for the drug to be purchased, before saying the price was “quite good actually”. The woman involved claimed she had been drunk, but began to feel uncomfortable about being alone with the MP as she became less intoxicated. She said that she retreated to her bedroom, but that he climbed into bed with her, naked. She said she did not ask him to leave or push him away because she was fearful about how he might react. She said she gave repeated warnings that she did not want to have sex with him, but alleged that he ground his body against her and groped her breasts. The woman is said not to have made a complaint to the police or any other authority, saying she wanted to forget about the incident. The MP has previously condemned the exploitation of young people involved in the drugs trade, including the “intimidation, violence and criminal incentives” involved. The ICGS was set up to tackle misconduct by MPs, peers and staff after complaints about misconduct. It has now been handed allegations that Warburton behaved inappropriately. Warburton’s Twitter account appeared to have been deleted on Saturday. The Observer approached Warburton for comment on Saturday. When contacted by the Sunday Telegraph, he said: “I have enormous amounts of defence, but unfortunately the way things work means that doesn’t come out first. I have heard nothing whatsoever from the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme. I’m sorry, I can’t comment any further.”",News/Politics,Tories suspend David Warburton amid claims over sexual harassment and drug use,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/02/tories-suspend-david-warburton-amid-claims-over-sexual-harassment-and-drug-use
4/3/2022,"Thomas Tuchel said he will not create a drama after Chelsea’s buildup for their Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid was rocked by a shock 4-1 defeat to Brentford at Stamford Bridge. On a day that supporters protested against the Ricketts family’s bid to buy the club from Roman Abramovich, Tuchel’s side were wretched against their lowly neighbours. Chelsea fell apart after going ahead through Antonio Rüdiger and will need to improve when they host Madrid on Wednesday. However, Tuchel insisted that Chelsea did not have an eye on the first leg of their tie against the La Liga side and the manager was willing to view his side’s implosion against a rampant Brentford as a one-off. “After so many wins and so many good results, I will now refuse to make a drama out of it,” he said. “Why should we? Brentford made a lot of the 10 minutes we gave them. After the third goal we had a disallowed goal, a pressing situation against the goalkeeper and another big chance from Kai Havertz. We missed all three and there was a feeling that it wasn’t our day. So it’s a mixture of everything. “We will dig in and try to find out why it was like this. There are some reasons which we can put on us and we will digest it. It’s hard to take because it’s very unusual for us. We will refocus on Monday.” Tuchel rejected suggestions that Chelsea were thinking about facing Madrid, arguing instead that his players were weary after the international break. “Maybe if we lost 1-0 or 2-0, or starting too late,” he said. “But this was not the case. We struggled in the beginning but I felt [we] more tired mentally. “Yesterday, we were wearing gloves and it was snowing in training. Today it was very, very warm. It’s more difficult for us than them to play as the underdog and be well prepared for this match. We are well prepared but are in one half of a training session. It is more difficult, but in the context of all this I am OK with the first half. The half-time speech was like this. A reminder to keep on going and it would come with more fluidity. And it did. We started very well. “Why should we be distracted and think about Real Madrid when we are one goal ahead? Maybe it was the general feeling that now we are ahead and have it and we got punished for that.” Tuchel said Chelsea were guilty of naive defending after Brentford hit back with a double from Vitaly Janelt and goals from Yoane Wissa and Christian Eriksen. “We did not defend mature[ly] enough,” he said. Thomas Frank was delighted after Brentford’s first win at Stamford Bridge since 1939 moved them 11 points above the bottom three. Brentford’s manager was pleased with Eriksen. The midfielder almost died from a cardiac arrest last summer but he has impressed since joining Frank’s side in January. “Every team has 11 players but sometimes you need key players to lift the rest by both playing well and their personality. Christian does that,” Frank said. “He is a very good player and I’m pleased he is playing for us.”",Sport/Football,Tuchel refuses to ‘make a drama’ despite Chelsea’s shock loss to Brentford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/02/thomas-tuchel-refuses-to-make-a-drama-despite-chelseas-shock-loss-to-brentford
4/3/2022,"Russia has been accused by Ukraine of using children as “human shields” while regrouping its forces, as the first horrifying witness accounts from the newly liberated town of Bucha, near Kyiv, emerge. Ukraine’s attorney general is gathering a dossier of claims about the Russian use of local children to avoid fire when in retreat from around Ukraine’s capital and elsewhere. Coaches of children were said to have been placed in front of tanks in the village of Novyi Bykiv, close to the encircled city of Chernihiv, 100 miles north of Kyiv. It was further alleged that children had been taken as hostages in a number of conflict hot spots around the country to ensure locals would not give the coordinates of the enemy’s movements to the Ukrainian forces. “Cases of using children as cover are recorded in Sumy, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhia oblasts [regions],” said Lyudmila Denisova, Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman. Colonel Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, spokesman for Ukraine’s ministry of defence, said the cases were being investigated by the country’s attorney general, but he was unable to provide further details. He said: “Enemies have been using Ukrainian children as a living shield when moving their convoys, moving their vehicles. “Russian soldiers have used Ukrainian children as hostages, putting them on their trucks. They’re doing it to protect their vehicles when moving. “There have been cases of brutal behaviour against minors been recorded, documented by a Ukrainian and international institutions, and we’d like to emphasise that information in each and every case will be given to the national criminal courts and the occupiers will be brought to justice for each and every military and war crime they commit.” Ukraine’s prosecutor general said at least 412 children had been injured or killed since the invasion began in February, of which 158 were dead. In further developments:  Witnesses have told the Observer of alleged war crimes against civilians in Bucha, as the town was liberated by Ukrainian forces. In one account, a 33-year-old mother and her two sons, eight and four, were shot dead by troops in a Russian armoured vehicle, along with a 62-year-old man, as they had sought to flee in two cars.  The bodies of at least 20 men in civilian clothes, one of whom had his hands tied, have been found lying in a street in Bucha, as Russian forces made what authorities in Kyiv said was a “rapid retreat” from territory around the capital on Saturday.  Ukrainian forces took around 30 towns and villages around Kyiv, including Brovary, a key city east of the capital. But President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the retreating troops were creating “a complete disaster” by leaving mines in homes and corpses as they retreated.  Pope Francis has said he is considering visiting the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and for the first time implicitly criticised the Russian president Vladimir Putin over the invasion of Ukraine. “We had thought invasions of other countries, savage street fighting and atomic threats were grim memories of a distant past,” he said.  Ukrainian military intelligence reported that residents in Izium, a city in east Ukraine, had given Russian soldiers from the 3rd Motor Rifle Division of the Russian Federation poisoned pies, killing two and putting 28 in intensive care.  Lithuania became the first EU country to ban the import of Russian gas. With Russia continuing to withdraw some of its ground forces from areas around the capital on Saturday, Zelenskiy’s adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said it now appeared the Kremlin was beating a “rapid retreat”. Podolyak warned, however, that the Kremlin had reverted to a plan to split the country. He said: “After the rapid retreat of the Russians from Kyiv and Chernihiv, and if we analyse all the redeployment and concentration of occupying troops, it is clear that Russia has prioritised another tactic – to move east/south, to control large occupied territories (not only in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts) and gain a strong foothold there. [Russia] will try to dig in there, put [in] air defence and thus sharply reduce the loss of his equipment and personnel.” In the east and the south, Ukrainian troops were holding their line, with the besieged city of Mariupol facing renewed barrages and little prospect of the evacuation of any more citizens. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said they were sending a team to try to help those trapped, following the failure of many attempts to organise humanitarian corridors. An ICRC spokesperson said: “The team departed Zaporizhzhia this morning. They are spending the night en route to Mariupol and are yet to reach the city.”",News/World news,"Ukrainian children used as ‘human shields’ near Kyiv, say witness reports",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/ukrainian-children-used-as-human-shields-near-kyiv-say-witness-reports
