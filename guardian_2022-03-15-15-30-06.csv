3/15/2022,"A“spring of discontent” is looming for the railways as unions and senior rail officials prepare for widespread industrial action in response to curbs in government emergency funding that spell job cuts, pay freezes and closures. Talks between the industry and unions to negotiate the £1.5bn-£2bn savings demanded by the Treasury were held through last year on the basis of no compulsory redundancies and no walkouts. That agreement lapsed at the end of 2021 – leaving unions warning of immediate strike action should any jobs be axed. That outcome now appears inevitable, with formal proposals for cuts, including substantial job losses in maintenance roles to save £100m annually at Network Rail, expected in the coming weeks. Train operators will try to cut staff costs in a move to contactless ticketing. Mick Lynch, the leader of rail’s biggest union, the RMT, says: “It’s our belief that they want to close virtually every ticket office on the mainline railway.” The roots of the dispute lie with the coronavirus pandemic, which has upended the finances of rail firms – potentially even more than those of the London Underground, where two 24-hour strikes earlier this month closed the tube. Passenger numbers have fluctuated similarly on both networks, from deserted at the start of the pandemic to between 60 and 70% of pre-Covid levels now. Yet the past two years have brought other changes that mean some are questioning how much power a stoppage still holds to disrupt on national rail and London transport. Tim Shoveller, a Network Rail regional director, said: “Even as passenger numbers start to recover, we know travel habits and passenger demand have changed and the industry has to change, too. We cannot keep relying on government handouts. We are discussing ideas with our unions about how we can modernise to create better and safer jobs for our people.” Unions argue that their members, who kept transport services running during the pandemic, should not pick up the tab, either on national rail or in the capital. More RMT walkouts are likely in London, where pensions as well as job cuts are in the frame, after the mayor, Sadiq Khan, was told to find £500m in annual cost savings in order to receive almost £5bn in emergency state funding to cover shrinking tube fare income. But do rail strikes still work for unions? Bringing London to a standstill for most of the working week would have been intolerable to many businesses before Covid; with Tube trains normally now only two-thirds full, the impact this month was muted. Many commuters could dodge the disruption by staying at home to work, leaving the city’s remaining trains, buses and roads crowded but far more functional than in strike days gone by. A similar picture could emerge on national rail this spring: some key commuter railways, such as South Western, which once heaved with annual season ticket holders riding daily to the City, have been left with their lucrative regular clientele melting away. A senior industry source says of the strike option: “They used to have an ace of spades. Now it’s a five of hearts.” Others disagree. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers’ union, contends that the threat of a strike could be “more powerful in the confusing new world created by Grant Shapps”. Under the transport secretary’s reforms to franchising, more of the railway is under central control through new contracts where all fare income goes to government rather than being at the operators’ risk. The London School of Economics professor Tony Travers, a local government expert, argues that despite the falling numbers of affected commuters who may be stranded by a rail strike, “the government, in a curious way by guaranteeing the income, has re-empowered the unions. They can use their muscle in the normal way because the government and Khan still want to keep the tube and the national railway running.” While smaller than the RMT, the drivers’ union has a greater ability to stop trains: in the Southern dispute of 2016-17, rail managers attempted to step in to replace striking RMT conductors but nothing ran on the few days that Aslef went on strike. At the moment, it is relatively relaxed about its members’ prospects: train companies remain short of drivers and rely on overtime – and about 2,000 drivers, who are typically middle-aged men, are due to retire in the next five years. However, Whelan says: “There are issues that would, rightly, lead to national action. Let’s remember that many of our members, who put themselves at risk for two years during the pandemic, have received no pay rises. That cannot continue.” The final year of an inflation-linked pay deal has kept tube salaries up in London but on national rail, Lynch says a two-year freeze is “effectively a 10% cut so far and the clock is ticking”. A total of 1,450 managers have also left Network Rail, so far by voluntary redundancy, saving £100m. The TSSA union said any compulsory cuts would prompt immediate industrial action. The Rail Delivery Group estimates that £14bn in fare revenue has been lost to the industry since the pandemic started, with another £6bn shortfall over the next three years. A spokesperson said it had been “an unprecedented financial shock”, adding: “The whole industry needs to respond to the challenges we face with the acceleration of changing travel patterns and more passengers migrating to digital technology.” Ticket offices are under threat of closure – a politically difficult prospect, not only because of union opposition. “People see there’s no argument when you do the sums,” said a senior figure at a rail operating group. “But they don’t want their own one closed.” For the RMT at least, there is no sign of strikes abating. The union has been coordinating action ranging from the night tube dispute, which has stopped Transport for London relaunching 24-hour weekend services, to walkouts by conductors on TransPennine Express, and outsourced train cleaners at Churchill in the south-east. “We don’t like going on strike. Our members lose money, we take a lot of heat and it’s not a great position,” Lynch says. However, he adds: “The reason people see us is because our union will not be cowed. The unions that have given way have lost membership and lost the ability to fight for people.” For Lynch, the point of this month’s walkouts was clear: “Where unions don’t fight, people end up on the minimum wage, no pension, no rights. I think it will make a difference because it shows people that we’re serious.”",News/Business,‘Spring of discontent’: wave of strikes loom for Covid-hit railways,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/15/spring-of-discontent-wave-of-strikes-loom-for-covid-hit-railways
3/15/2022,"Almost 800 medical graduates could be denied the chance to train as doctors in the NHS this year, despite the health service’s crippling shortage of medics. A total of 791 medical undergraduates who have applied to start training as junior doctors at the start of August have been told there are no places for them – the highest number ever. The risk that young would-be doctors may not be allocated to start their training at a hospital in the UK has sparked concern among the medical students affected, as well as medical organisations. Pressure is growing for action to close the gap between the number of training places available across the NHS and the number of graduates seeking one, so medical talent is not wasted and hospitals hire as many fresh recruits as they can to help tackle the widespread lack of medics. Doctors are worried that the mismatch between demand for and supply of training places will lead to the NHS missing out on medics it sorely needs and that some of those denied a place will either go to work abroad instead or give up medicine altogether. The most recent official figures showed that the NHS in England is short of almost 8,200 doctors. Dr Dustyn Saint, a GP in Norfolk, tweeted the health secretary, Sajid Javid, about the situation, saying: “Sajid Javid sort this out! You know how much general practice needs these people in a few years, standing by and doing nothing is inexcusable.” Another doctor said: “It’s bonkers that 800 would-be doctors could be denied training places at a time when the NHS in England is short of 8,200 doctors.” Half (393) the 791 will soon graduate from UK medical schools while the other half (398) are “eligibility applicants” – those with a medical degree from an overseas medical school who are entitled to work in the UK or who graduated from a British medical school before August 2020. The UK Foundation Programme (UKFPO) ensures that aspirant doctors who have just graduated from medical school are able to start foundation one training, the bottom rung of the ladder that leads to medics becoming fully qualified. Training usually starts in the August after graduation. But the UKFPO has warned that the foundation programme is “over-subscribed” to a record level this year, raising the prospect that some of the 791 may not be allocated a training slot. While it has already filled 8,209 foundation training places, the 791 who have missed out so far have been put on a reserve list. The UKFPO, which is run by Health Education England (HEE), has told them that: “We would like to reassure the applicants on our reserve list, who may be feeling anxious, that we are currently working very hard to find additional places for everyone who needs one.” It works with the health departments in the four home nations to ensure that the NHS has as many new trainee doctors as they need and works with them to increase numbers if necessary. The 791 is the largest number of applicants on record that the UKFPO has not placed by this stage of the year. In 2017 only 25 graduates were in that position, though that number has risen sharply in recent years and by last year had risen to 494. HEE has blamed the situation on a record number of applicants and promised “pastoral support” to medical graduates on the reserve list, many of whom are anxious about their futures. “There have been record numbers of applicants for the 2022 foundation programme. Although the statutory medical education bodies have increased the number of foundation posts available, we recognise that 791 students have been placed on the reserve list,” said Prof Liz Hughes, HEE’s deputy medical director. It has sought to reassure graduates without a training place that they will get one somewhere in the UK by August. Places will be freed because historically about 7% of applicants withdraw between applying and starting their F1 training, it said. The British Medical Association has voiced concern about the large number of unallocated medics. “Now we have a situation where a record number are left with unnecessary uncertainty about where they are headed this August,” said Khadija Meghrawi, the co-chair of its medical students committee. “In a time where student mental health is declining, this additional source of uncertainty and stress is particularly unfair.” Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “It is important we get to the bottom of why this has happened and address it as soon as possible. It’s encouraging that we have so many people completing medical school and wanting to continue their training. This needs to be matched by capacity in foundation training schemes.” Azeem Majeed, a professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, said: “It’s essential that workforce planning in the NHS is adequate, given that there are shortages of many health professionals, including doctors. This means having enough foundation posts for newly qualified doctors. “It’s likely that most of the 791 people without foundation doctor posts will eventually be allocated one but it does create undue stress for them and they may be allocated a role in a part of England where it may be difficult for them to work due to family reasons.”",News/Society,791 medical graduates could miss out on NHS junior doctor training,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/15/791-medical-graduates-could-miss-out-on-nhs-junior-doctor-training
3/15/2022,"Lyse Doucet, the BBC’s chief international correspondent in Ukraine, has paid tribute to the broadcaster’s “brave and committed” technical staff and said they had even helped with a dental emergency. Doucet, currently based in Kyiv and a familiar face of BBC journalism from war zones, said she and her fellow reporters could not do their jobs without a team of producers, camera people and technical support staff. In an article for the Radio Times, she said an engineer had been able to help when she broke a tooth while reporting from Ukraine. “When I broke a tooth and couldn’t access the emergency CT scans from a Ukrainian dental clinic, Sully swiftly downloaded some software and dispatched a photo to my dentist back home,” she said. “Within hours of my appointment for a root canal in Kyiv, an urgent email arrived from London [saying] ‘you don’t need one!’.” She flew to the Ukrainian capital in late January and has been reporting on the Russian military buildup and subsequent invasion. She regularly joined the BBC News presenter Clive Myrie, who recently returned to the UK, during news bulletins from Ukraine. Doucet said: “The news bulletins might have looked like the Clive Myrie show in the BBC’s Kyiv bunker but that’s only the half of it. Getting the real story out of Ukraine … takes a team of brave and committed producers, camera people and technical support. We BBC correspondents and presenters could not do our jobs without them.” Myrie heaped praise on his colleague Doucet on Monday, describing her as “one of the best journalists of our generation.” Last week he shared photographs on social media of them during the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. In a separate interview with the Telegraph, Doucet said her emotion “doesn’t matter” when she is reporting. She said: “Nobody wants to see my emotion, it doesn’t matter – except to me. We’re here to report, and convey what’s happening here. There’s enough emotion in war already without adding more. We’re not trying to be heroes.

3/15/2022,"The UK government must urgently bring forward billions of pounds in pledged spending on insulation and heat pumps, and reinstate the universal credit uplift to help poor households cope with soaring energy and food prices, civil society groups have told ministers. Vulnerable households are already facing stark choices between heating and eating, with hardship set to become even worse before next winter as rises in the cost of living bite, fuelled by the war in Ukraine. Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Save the Children and Age UK are among 33 civil society groups that have written to the prime minister, Boris Johnson, the chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak, and the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, to call for £3.6bn for insulation grants to all households, and an extra £4bn by 2025 to install heat pumps in place of gas boilers. The letter, seen by the Guardian, also called for benefits to be increased in line with April’s inflation rate, rather than the lower 3.1% planned, and for the £20 uplift in universal credit that was part of the Covid-19 response to be restored. The government promised in its 2019 election manifesto to spend more than £9bn on insulation and energy efficiency for British homes. Ministers are understood to be finalising plans over the coming days for a new energy security strategy that will boost renewables such as wind and solar power, and to pump more oil and gas from the North Sea, while the chancellor will unveil the spring statement, or “mini budget”, next Wednesday. But climate and poverty campaigners are concerned that measures that could provide rapid relief to poorer households, such as home insulation, will be sidelined as debate within government rages over projects such as fracking and new licences for the North Sea. Juliet Phillips, senior policy adviser at E3G, one of the groups behind the letter, said: “Green homes are the most obvious energy security solution no one is talking about. Energy security starts at home: this means supercharging a renovation wave to cut energy bills and permanently reduce the exposure of families to volatile international gas markets – boosting energy efficiency and rolling out electric heat pumps.” Fracking is unlikely to be viable on a large scale in the UK, and would not produce any gas for years. New exploration in the North Sea would also take years, if not decades, to produce gas. However, some Conservative backbenchers and sections of the media have called for them as a response to surging energy prices. Officials are also understood to have engaged in informal early-stage contacts with EDF, Drax and Uniper, which operate coal-fired or biomass power stations, about the possibility of delaying planned closures of coal-fired units, or increasing coal burning. However, the Guardian understands that this is a contingency plan that is unlikely to be necessary as the government believes electricity supplies in excess of those recommended by the National Grid have already been secured through its contracts for a different scheme. A government spokesperson said: “The UK remains committed to ending the use of coal power by 2024. We will be setting out plans to boost our long-term energy resilience and domestic supply shortly. The operation of UK coal plants is ultimately a commercial matter and we have made no formal request to EDF.” Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said insulation and support for vulnerable households were more effective ways of reducing Russia’s ability to weaponise energy prices. “This is a fossil fuel crisis, and new fossil fuels from the likes of fracking or new North Sea oil and gas aren’t going to solve our problems. We can reach true energy freedom and stand up to [Vladimir] Putin, but that needs the government to back properly funded measures to support households, accelerate renewables and properly fund home upgrades to reduce our use of gas altogether,” she said. Children were already feeling the impact of the sudden increases in the cost of living that have followed the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, campaigners said. Dan Paskins, director of UK impact at Save the Children UK, said: “Parents are telling us they’re struggling to meet basic needs, leaving them having to make impossible choices between heating their homes and buying clothes for their children, and children are paying the price. Without action, things are only going to get harder.” There is good evidence that insulation schemes work, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a thinktank, which has calculated that energy efficiency measures installed in the last decade save UK householders nearly £1.2bn a year. Those savings could have been much higher, but the rates of home upgrades dropped sharply after the government abandoned its flagship scheme in 2015. Heat pumps could also be rolled out far faster, according to Jan Rosenow, director at the Regulatory Assistance Project thinktank. He found that the UK could eliminate fossil fuel imports completely by increasing insulation and installing heat pumps in place of gas boilers. Heat pumps will be about £260 a year cheaper than gas boilers from April. According to the letter sent to the government, the costs of grants to vulnerable households, and incentives that could be offered to all households for insulation and the switch to heat pumps, could be met through the government’s £16bn green gilt programme, the UK Infrastructure Bank, and a new green funding scheme from the Bank of England.",News/Business,"UK must spend on home insulation and heat pumps, ministers told",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/15/uk-must-spend-on-home-insulation-and-heat-pumps-ministers-told
3/15/2022,"The directors of Shell are being sued for failing to properly prepare the multinational oil and gas company for net zero. In what is thought to be a first-of-its-kind action, the lawsuit brought by activist shareholders claims that Shell’s 13 directors are personally liable for failing to devise a strategy in line with the Paris agreement, which aims to limit global heating to below 2C by slashing fossil fuel emissions. The lawsuit claims the failure puts the directors in breach of their duties under the UK’s Companies Act. If successful, Shell’s board could be forced by the courts to change its strategy, taking specific concrete steps to align its plan with the Paris deal. But if the claimants lose, they could be liable for the full costs of the case, including directors’ legal fees. ClientEarth, the environmental law organisation taking the action against Shell, said it was calling for other shareholders to join. At Shell’s 2021 annual general meeting more than 30% of shareholders voted against the board in support of a resolution calling for Paris-aligned emissions targets. But other shareholders may be reluctant to join after Shell announced in February an increase in dividends and a plan to buy back shares – increasing the value of those remaining in investors’ hands – after reporting a staggering $19bn profit. ClientEarth has said it is taking the action against Shell in the company’s best interests. Their claim says the board has failed to properly account for the risks climate change poses to the company. Under the Companies Act, directors are legally bound to act in a way that promotes the company’s success and to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence. Paul Benson, a ClientEarth lawyer, said: “It’s the first of its kind, this case. It’s the first time that anyone has sought to hold the board accountable for failing to properly prepare for the net zero transition.” “It is highly novel, we’re in uncharted territory here but we see real merit with this claim. We think, frankly, the longer the board delays with this the more likely it is that the company is going to have to execute this sort of handbrake turn to retain commercial competitiveness, to meet the challenges of inevitable regulatory developments.” It will not be the first time Shell has faced action over emissions. In May 2021, a Dutch court ruled the company must reduce its emissions – including those from the fuel it sells – by 45% by the end of 2030. But Shell’s directors have appealed against that verdict and published an “energy transition strategy” outlining the company’s aim to reach net zero by 2050 – a transition it describes as “in step with society”. ClientEarth’s lawyers say the strategy does not meet the targets scientists say are critical to avoid catastrophic climate change. “We say in our claim that Shell’s board is mismanaging the material and foreseeable climate risk facing the company,” Benson said. “Shell is actually really quite exposed to the risks of climate change those are physical risks and transitional risks. They are exposed to what we call stranded asset risk, where their assets – for example their facilities, their physical infrastructure – the value of that is just going to reduce or it will become a liability as the net zero transition progresses. “And they are exposed to massive write-downs of those assets.” A Shell spokesperson said: “To be a net-zero emissions business by 2050, we are delivering on our global strategy that supports the Paris agreement. This includes the industry-leading target we have set to halve emissions from our global operations by 2030, and transforming our business to provide more low-carbon energy for customers. “Addressing a challenge as big as climate change requires action from all quarters. The energy supply challenges we are seeing underscore the need for effective, government-led, policies to address critical needs such as energy security while decarbonising our energy system. These challenges cannot be solved by litigation.”",News/Business,Shell directors sued for ‘failing to prepare company for net zero’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/15/shell-directors-sued-net-zero-clientearth

Cuba’s capital, Havana, is at the north-western end of the island. Occasionally, during otherwise warm winter months, cold air masses move down from the US, bringing much lower temperatures, sometimes into single figures. On one occasion, in the mid-19th century, snow fell and there was a heavy frost – unknown since then. The southern coast is more sheltered, and in July and August it can get unpleasantly hot and muggy, with sudden and heavy thunderstorms in the afternoon after the buildup of heat. As in the whole of this region, July, August and September may bring tropical storms and hurricanes, especially in the eastern part of the island.

3/15/2022,"As we watch the conflict in Ukraine unfold, many people are struggling with a sense of their own powerlessness. They have a fierce urge to do something to help. Recent polling shows that the public believes the UK government should be doing more to welcome Ukrainian refugees. It’s clear our country has been moved and wants to help those whose lives have been turned upside down by the conflict. The government is now attempting to harness this wave of compassion and sympathy with its “homes for Ukraine” scheme. On the face of it, the plan is bold and ambitious. Any person who wants to take a Ukrainian refugee into their home will be able to do so as long as they can name them and they have a visa. The echoes of David Cameron’s “big society” are impossible to miss. The scheme certainly has great potential to bring people face to face with the experience of refugees and support them. It’s already happening in Poland, Germany and other countries in Europe where Ukrainians don’t need visas to enter and are being granted permission to stay for up to three years with full rights and entitlements. The public welcoming refugees into their homes in this way and on this scale feels unprecedented. However, in one area the UK’s approach remains far more restrictive than that of our neighbours: the insistence on visas. The government is relying on what is effectively a managed migration route to respond to a humanitarian crisis. This inevitably means paperwork and bureaucracy are being put before people’s urgent needs. Imagine a child who has been separated from their mother and father having to navigate a visa application to reach safety in the UK. Despite the failure to waive the visa requirements, some Ukrainians will be able to get to the UK under the new scheme. Ensuring their safety and wellbeing when they arrive will be vital. Even with the best of intentions on all sides, there are potentially many things that could go wrong which need to be addressed in advance. Sponsors may not always be sensitive or reasonable in their expectations – we all know stories about flat shares, housemates or landlords that don’t work out. Living with someone you’ve only just met can be difficult for both sides, for all the joy it can also bring. There are also risks that refugees will end up in inappropriate or at worst exploitative conditions. The government has said that those offering accommodation will be vetted, and it’s imperative appropriate checks are put in place. At the Refugee Council, we are particularly concerned that people coming here who have already had their lives shattered will not have access to housing benefits. If the relationship with the sponsor breaks down and they are unable to pay for private rented accommodation without welfare support there is a real risk they could end up homeless, which would be devastating. Allowing them to access housing benefit would also give them the opportunity to move into their own home if they choose to in the longer term. I understand there are some Ukrainians who have arrived already and who are keen to do this. If the government is refusing to facilitate this, there must be an alternative safety net so no Ukrainian ends up sleeping on the streets. The women and children arriving from Ukraine will also have specific needs given the traumatic experiences they have been through. They should all be given an initial health check and be able to register with a GP. Children will need to get into schools or childcare as quickly as possible too. So the government needs to ensure that doctors, schools, mental health and counselling services have the resources to respond to these needs. There must be a standard public service offer to any Ukrainian regardless of where they are housed in the country, and access to a specialist support worker. The programme should certainly not be delivered on the cheap. We should also not forget the needs of refugee communities already in this country. Many refugees from Afghanistan are still stuck in hotels without longer-term accommodation. There are also about 25,000 people in the asylum system having to cope in basic, sometimes very cramped, hotel rooms. While our attention is understandably on the plight of Ukrainians let’s not ignore the fact that the asylum system needs to be properly resourced so that claims can be resolved more quickly and people can be housed in accommodation that meets their needs. At present a Ukrainian arriving through the asylum system could have to wait months and months to be granted permission to stay. It is also deeply ironic that at this time when the public so badly want to show their support to refugees from Ukraine, there is legislation before parliament that seeks to criminalise and repel any refugee who reaches our shores. The government’s nationality and borders bill is a cruel and misguided attack on refugee rights. Now more than ever is the time to strengthen our commitment to welcoming refugees from all parts of the world, not seeking to slam our door in their face. The outpouring of public support is remarkable. The challenge now is to harness it in the best possible way, ensure all Ukrainians have a genuinely warm, safe and secure welcome, and use this moment to rethink our approach as a country to all refugees, to strengthen our commitment to refugee rights rather than weaken it.

3/15/2022,"Faced with rising gasoline prices, many Americans are now looking to switch to an electric car. But the shift away from fossil fuel vehicles has been criticized by Senator Joe Manchin, who has said he is “very reluctant” to see the proliferation of battery-powered cars. There has been a surge in interest in buying electric vehicles (EVs) in the wake of the war in Ukraine, analysts say, with drivers in the US unnerved by gasoline prices that have surpassed $4.30 a gallon as a result of the conflict and the supply chain issues from the pandemic. Joe Biden has repeatedly championed the growth of the nascent EV market as a way to tackle the climate crisis, with America’s heavy dependency on polluting cars a major source of planet-heating emissions. But Manchin, the centrist Democrat who holds a key swing vote in the US Senate, has poured scorn on the idea of phasing out gasoline and diesel cars. “I’m very reluctant to go down the path of electric vehicles,” Manchin said at the energy conference CERAWeek, held in Houston. “I’m old enough to remember standing in line in 1974 trying to buy gas – I remember those days. I don’t want to have to be standing in line waiting for a battery for my vehicle, because we’re now dependent on a foreign supply chain, mostly China.” Manchin, who has taken more money in political donations from fossil fuel interests than any other senator, also said he has “a hard time understanding” why the federal government would invest in a network of electric car charging stations, as the Biden administration aims to do. “I’ve read history, and I remember Henry Ford inventing the Model-T, but I sure as hell don’t remember the US government building filling stations,” Manchin said to applause. “The market did that.” The West Virginia senator’s criticism is ominous for the White House’s hopes of passing major climate legislation this year. The climate elements of the Build Back Better Act, which Manchin’s opposition has so far stalled, included half a trillion dollars in clean energy tax credits as well as major rebates for electric car purchases to drive up their adoption. Manchin’s comments also come amid renewed consumer interest in EVs reported by car dealers as some Americans look to bypass the volatility of the global oil market altogether. The past month has seen a strong increase in the number of people searching online for hybrid and battery electric vehicles, according to Edmunds, a car shopping and industry analyst website. This is a continuation of the broader growth of EVs in recent years “but the major surge in interest of late is certainly more of a reaction to record gas prices sparked by the war in Ukraine”, according to Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds. “Anecdotally we are hearing a lot about a greater interest in EVs because of what is going on in Ukraine, but the real test is whether that will last,” said Ed Kim, president of AutoPacific, an auto industry research firm. Kim said that gas-powered cars built in the US are already full of foreign-made parts. “Joe Manchin represents West Virginia which is dependent upon coal so I believe he has a vested interest in downplaying clean energy,” Kim said. “Look at what’s happening right now, we are seeing fuel prices we haven’t seen in years because of geopolitical issues. Any measures we take to reduce our reliance on petroleum is good for our economy, our environment and to ensure the country doesn’t come screeching to a halt.” Previous jumps in the price of gasoline, such as in 2008, saw a corresponding increase in sales of battery-powered and hybrid cars and analysts expect a similar spike as a result of the current crisis. Around half a million electric cars were sold in the US last year, up more than 80% on 2020, with consumers attracted to a slew of new models such Ford’s Mustang Mach-E and the Telsa Model Y. While traditional car makers such as Ford and GM are now making significant investments in the EV market, demand is now regularly outstripping pandemic-hit supply, meaning the ballooning interest in going electric may end in frustration. “Unfortunately, making an EV purchase is not particularly easy to do right now amid inventory shortages,” said Caldwell. Owning an electric car is far cheaper than a gas-powered one due to a lower cost of fuel and fewer mechanical problems but the up-front cost of most EVs is typically more than $40,000. This means they are often out of reach for many low-income Americans who are already forced, due to the car-centric design of US cities and suburbia, to spend a large amount of their money on running a vehicle to go to work and complete other routine trips. The Biden administration is aiming for 50% of new car sales to be electric by 2030 – last year the total share was around 3% – and industry experts say that major investments will need to be made to hit this target. “Dependence on oil is funding some of the most brutal regimes in the world today. There’s nothing to suggest any component of an EV would resemble the current national security, environmental and humanitarian cost of oil.” said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy. “The transition to EVs is inevitable at this point – the timeline is up to consumers and policymakers. The events in Ukraine are a reminder how volatile and destructive a dependence on oil is and that should only accelerate this timeline.”",News/Environment,Manchin ‘very reluctant’ on electric cars in ominous sign for Biden’s climate fight,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/15/manchin-reluctant-electric-cars-biden-climate-crisis-fight
3/15/2022,"Everything is terrible. You know this as well as anyone because, like the rest of the world, you have spent the past few years pummelled by waves of awful historical events, each more debilitating than the last. The only thing that would make everything even worse is dunking your head into the furious, screaming world of social media. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. In times of enormous crisis, one way to find temporary respite is to dilute your feeds with goodness. Below, I – along with some wonderful Guardian readers – have tracked down 50 feelgood social media accounts. Some are on Twitter, some on Instagram, some on TikTok. Some are uplifting, some are funny, some are weird, many have dogs in them. Sprinkle your accounts into your scrolling and you should end up in a much better frame of mind. Bananner Joe, TikTok For the most part, this is simply a meme account. But it warrants inclusion here for its “shampoo prank” videos, in which a bodybuilder’s attempts to rinse shampoo out of his hair are perpetually thwarted by a hidden stranger. Maybe the hardest I have laughed at anything ever. Abraham Bunga, TikTok Abraham Bunga only really has one joke – showing how people from different parts of London react to various circumstances – but luckily it’s a good one. The more of his videos you watch, the more you anticipate the punchline. And, since the punchline always dunks on people from west London, it’s always delightful. Scott Seiss, TikTok Nobody on the internet has ever quite captured the hell of retail work like Seiss, who spends his videos talking back to a succession of awful unseen customers. If you have ever worked in a shop, getting to live vicariously through Seiss is joyful. Alistair Green, Twitter Comedian Alistair Green is notorious for his neatly observed one-man videos that skewer politicians, male feminists, artificially woke brands and, increasingly, himself. Rosie Holt, Twitter In Holt’s videos she poses as rightwing figures outraged about whatever happens to be in the news. Recently she went viral for pretending to be an MP so convincingly she tricked actual MPs. Stevie Martin, Twitter Martin makes videos with Lola-Rose Maxwell, in which she becomes increasingly bewildered by various aspects of the modern world. Funnier than I’ve made it sound. Good News Network, Twitter If, like me, your Twitter feed feels perfectly calibrated to ruin your emotional resilience, the Good News Network exists to counter that. It only posts happy, fun news stories. None of them are essential, but doesn’t the idea of non-essential news sound great? Goodable, Twitter (submitted by Ben Marshall, Australia)A great companion account to the Good News Network, delivering happy news only. Particularly great at finding the chinks of light in times of war. Happy Eco News, Instagram Every day for the past four years, Happy Eco News has posted five hopeful, uplifting stories about the environment. They’re not all topical (one recent example was just a description of cassowaries), but it’s good, wholesome content nonetheless. Heroic Girls, Twitter (submitted by James Vallance, Oxfordshire)James says: “Highlighting strong role models for girls, particularly in comics. It’s great to scroll through their tweets to get ideas for my daughter and me to read up on.” Dr Radha Modgil, Instagram During the pandemic, Dr Radha took to writing short, helpful posts listing tiny steps that people can take to ease the burden of everything. This practice has continued since the end of lockdown, and Radha remains an undefeated well of useful positivity. Good Good Good Co, Instagram Like the good news Twitter accounts, except the stories are boiled down to their essentials and spread through Instagram, which makes it better somehow. Wholesome Memes, Twitter Try to imagine a joke book where all the punchlines are happy endings. This is Wholesome Memes. There’s still a fighting chance that the whole thing is a big sarcastic joke at our expense, but it feels good anyway. Peter Lovatt, Twitter Author of The Dance Cure, Lovatt is an academic who regularly posts videos of himself dancing with wild abandon. I follow Peter, and the ease with which his dancing can cheer me up is frightening. This article includes content provided by Instagram.

Tommy Winkler, TikTok There are plenty of food accounts on TikTok, but none radiate the same level of slapdash joy as Winkler’s. None of his food looks particularly nice, and all of it is bad for you. Nevertheless, his sheer infectiousness makes him an instant go-to. Mr Forge, TikTok Everyone loves a TikTok account with a purpose, and Mr Forge has the best purpose of all time: can he cook food with superheated molten metal? Spoiler: not really, no. Adventures in Jelly, Instagram (submitted by Jennifer Cranmer, Dumfries)Jennifer says: “Caroline collects vintage jelly moulds and makes the most fantastical jellies. She videos them with music sometimes, which is hilarious – these incredible creations jiggling on a plate make me smile every time.” Satisfying Soap ASMR, Instagram In which a woman with a very sharp knife gently slices through various bars of soap. Honestly, one of the most profoundly satisfying things on the internet. Salvage Rebuilds UK, Instagram (submitted by Chris Shea, Godalming)Chris says: “Two guys (Rob and Chris) from Kent who buy old cars and fix them up. They love what they do, and it’s just very soothing watching them pottering about, having cups of tea and enjoying their work.” Kitpbs, Instagram (submitted by Peter Stubbs, London)Peter says this account “does micrographics of kit that runners wore to commemorate personal bests. There’s no judgment or sneeriness – everyone is celebrated equally, whether a super fast 5k runner or someone who just completed their first marathon.” Francis Bourgeois, TikTok Currently the world’s most famous trainspotter, Bourgeois enjoys tracking down rare rolling stock and then, with the help of a GoPro attached to his head, records his own infectious delight. Enbiggen, TikTok The effort that goes into maintaining the Enbiggen TikTok must be phenomenal. It’s a series of beautifully constructed Rube Goldberg machines that, as they unfold, play note-perfect recreations of famous songs. Staggering. The Object, TikTok If you ever wanted to see closeup what a blueberry looks like when it’s cut with a hot knife, this account of compelling, satisfying macro videos is for you. Beautiful Abandoned Places, Instagram Exactly what it sounds like – objects and buildings that have outlived human use are revisited and photographed. Eerie and beautiful. Stanley Chow, Instagram One of the world’s most instantly identifiable illustrators displays his wares – and occasionally fan-submitted pictures of him holding a picture of himself for some reason. Yuki Kawae, Instagram A still, meditative account, where a Zen-inspired artist makes shapes in sand. Instant mindfulness.

It’s hilarious!” Foxes in Love, Instagram (submitted by Shelley Thomas, Manchester)Shelley says: “The creator produces cartoons of two foxes, which represent him and his partner. It is relatable, wholesome and feelgood and brings a smile to the face every morning it is published.” Second Chance Animal Rescue, Facebook (submitted by Alan Grieve, Dunfermline)A rare diversion to Facebook, for an animal rescue centre. Alan says: “Ena and Frank Conyon, who run the kennels, are the administrators of this joyous page, which celebrates the stories of all the dogs and their new owners.” The Asher House, Facebook (submitted by Lynette Coleman, Canterbury)Lynette says: “Lee Asher rescues all sorts of animals, giving them a wonderful life at his beautiful estate sanctuary in Oregon. He’s an amazing guy with a genuine love for the animals, a huge personality and a sense of humour. And he’s a real good-looking hunk!” Woof Woof TV, Instagram Billing itself as “your one and only source for doggo posts” (legal disclaimer: it is far from the only source), Woof Woof TV is just loads of pictures of dogs. Cute dogs, silly dogs, big dogs, tiny dogs, dogs dressed as vegetables. Please, go crazy. Seal Rescue Ireland, Instagram The official page of a centre that saves, heals and releases sick and injured seals. However cute you think this account might be, triple it and you still won’t be close. Anne Louise Avery, Twitter (submitted by Chris Murphy, Chesterfield)Chris says: “Anne’s beautifully written, daily Old Fox short stories touch on current events, but also provide some welcome escapism and brightness in otherwise gloomy times.” Dogs Working From Home, Instagram If you like looking at photos of dogs looking at laptops, some of them while wearing glasses, then this Instagram account will give you what you want to an almost scary degree of accuracy. The account doesn’t update frequently, but it’s usually a doozy when it does. Old Time Hawkey, TikTok If you have ever dreamed of running away from this hellish world and starting again with nothing, Old Time Hawkey is basically an instruction manual. He cooks food on open fires. He goes ice fishing. He walks through snowy woodlands with his dog. Instantly relaxing. Cabins in the Woods, Instagram Incidentally, while you’re planning to run away, here is an Instagram account full of the most beautifully designed woodland cabins you will ever find. You could lose hours here, in both admiration and jealousy. Asa Steinars, Instagram Some of you might find that this account is a little too influencer-y – Steinars does like to position herself in the centre of most of her photos – but the appeal lies in all the spectacular Icelandic landscapes. This is where we should all run away to. Tulips in Holland, Instagram During the winter months, Tulips in Holland is a haven of springtime. You’ll find loads and loads of pictures of tulips here; some closeup, some in formation, all beautiful. Anne Par Avion, Instagram Photos of landscapes and architecture so well framed they occasionally threaten to stray into Wes Anderson territory, in the sense that Wes Anderson movies make you want to go on holiday. Victor Cheng, Instagram More Wes Anderson-y photography, except Cheng lives in Hong Kong. All his shots are of teeming cities, with a speciality in absurdly tall residential skyscrapers. Beautiful.

Mondo Mascots, Instagram (submitted by Jay, Cardiff)Jay says: “An almost-daily venture into the many absurd, bizarre or downright adorable Japanese mascots out there. For example, meet Tokitama, a hairy-legged egg wearing a fried egg on its head – a mascot for a shopping street.” One Minute Briefs, Twitter (submitted by Ciaran McKeon, Dublin)Ciaran says: “Each day, they post a daily ‘brief’ for anything, from paperclips to dog food. You are then challenged to post your idea to advertise that item, and it should take you only one minute.” Spurs Trophies, Twitter (submitted by Tim, Hertfordshire)Tim says: “Who wouldn’t want to wake up every day to a reminder of how long it is since Spurs won a trophy? Currently 5,132 days.” Retronaut, Twitter Just a bunch of fascinating old pictures. A woman on a stove. A man with a cat in his beard. The shark from Jaws. Tina Turner. A tilted bus. There’s no pattern to them, but they’re all excellent. Postcards From the Past, Twitter A series of old postcards. What makes this account brilliant is that each card is accompanied by some of the messages on the back. My favourite? A Dartmoor postcard, with the message: “Uncle Tony’s A NAUGHTY BOY.” 70s Dinner Party, Twitter A collection of genuinely monstrous food photographs from 1970s recipe books, including Frankfurter stew, illuminated gelatine, and something called “celery-stuffed celery”. It is amazing we’re not all dead. Hydraulic Press Channel, Instagram An account where a mysterious user destroys things with his hydraulic press: a pumpkin; a Minion; a tub of glitter. Not only is it immensely fun, but it also feels suitably nihilistic for 2022. Actual Heathcliff Comics, Twitter All this account does is post real Heathcliff comic strips, in a bid to show the world what an absurdly inward-looking receptacle for bizarre anti-jokes the character has become. It is astonishing.

3/15/2022,"The hill called Hay Cop at this national nature reserve commands spectacular views southwards across Derbyshire. So I forgive myself for not initially noticing the two limestone slabs standing upright in a dismantled wall. This drystone structure is being rebuilt and these two columns, 1.2 metres high, perhaps 35cm apart, have been left to serve presumably as the stile through which walkers will pass. The stones were probably first cut when there was no such thing as engine noise here and the loudest human sounds were the clank of hammer on metal as a thick L-shaped iron bar was driven into the heart of one rock as a gate hinge. Next to this detail is snagged a long, whitish, wind-wittering strand of wool, and it occurs to me that this one hair has a heritage stretching back probably to the Zagros mountains of Iran, where sheep began their 11,000-year journey of domestication to this very spot. On the other stone, however, is the evidence of a deeper past. The surface limestone ripples with fossils of crinoids or sea lilies, echinoderm animals anchored by a central rope-like stem into the seabed and possessed of swaying seaweedy limbs that sifted out planktonic food from the currents when this place was an ocean more than 300m years ago. The beautiful crinoid remnants take me to another time, but there is one detail here that carries me into another galaxy. Around the old gate hinge is a tarnished grey metal mass, used to secure the blacksmith’s ironwork and probably extracted from these very hillsides, given that lead mining here dates back to the Romans. Yet lead originates through stellar nucleosynthesis in the hearts of stars called supernovae, whose explosions have scattered the rare element across space, until it finally came to rest at the birth of our solar system about five billion years ago. Lead was veined through the underworld of this landscape and then fixed as solder around this hinge. So, walker, when you pass this spot next, recall that you are seeing the one place, but you are brushing past a whole universe.

3/15/2022,"A video posted on social media showing armed men burning a man to death in western Ethiopia has drawn condemnation and renewed fear over increasing horrific incidents of ethnic violence. Eleven people, including nine ethnic Tigrayans, were killed on 3 March in the Ayisid Kebele of Metekel zone, in the Benishangul-Gumuz region where waves of ethnic violence over the last year have killed hundreds of people. Ten of the people were shot dead while the 11th, a Tigrayan man, was burnt alive according to the Ethiopia Human Rights Commission (EHRC). The commission said the “extra-judicial killings” were carried out by Ethiopian forces and other armed groups according to its investigations. In clips from the graphic five-minute video which emerged on social media on Saturday, more than 50 armed men, including from the Ethiopian army, are seen carrying a man in plainclothes towards a charred, burnt out heap, where it appears people had already been burned. After lobbing insults at him, they throw him on to the heap, adding branches, wood and grass to reignite the fire. According to researchers, the men spoke Amhara and some are from the Amhara militia group, Fanos, a regional ethnic militia group that has been fighting alongside Ethiopian forces according to several reports, during a bloody, on-going conflict between Ethiopia and the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, in the north of the country. In a statement on Sunday the EHRC said, “the act of burning bodies and a person into death was perpetrated by members of government security forces and the involvement of other people and the action was an extra-judicial killing.” The killings happened after government forces and other armed groups responded to attacks that occurred the day before, when 20 government security force men and three civilians were killed by militants in the restive area. The following day, government forces conducted widespread searches, and intercepted a bus full of either Tigrayans who had just been freed from detention. The Tigrayans were accused of aiding the militants who carried out the attack, eyewitnesses told the EHRC. “You are the ones who provided the information (to the gunmen)” the Tigrayans were told, and were then shot dead, alongside two others, eyewitnesses said. Another Tigrayan found hiding in a government security vehicle nearby was then taken away and burned alive, recorded in the footage that has since sparked widespread outrage and demands for accountability in Ethiopia. A war that began in November 2020, when Nobel prize winner and prime minister Abiy Ahmed launched a military offensive against the TPLF, has further exploded historic, regional and ethnic divisions in Ethiopia. Forces from Amhara and Afar in Ethiopia, as well as historic foe Eritrea, have been involved in the conflict. Mass atrocities along ethnic lines have taken place on all sides, yet many are committed by Ethiopian aligned forces. According to William Davison, a senior analyst on Ethiopia at Crisis Group, the “horrifying video” fits a pattern of incidents in recent years where Tigrayan citizens have been targeted in Ethiopia and blamed for being involved in plots to undermine the state. “Accompanying the civil war in northern Ethiopia has been a broader suspicion of Tigrayans for supporting Tigray region’s armed resistance, which has led to persecution of that group. There have been other incidents in recent years of mob violence against Tigrayans. So the fact that these Tigrayans in Metekel have been accused and summarily executed does fit a pattern,” he said. “Metekel Zone in Benishangul-Gumuz region has experienced serious intercommunal and insurgent-counterinsurgent violence for a number of years,” he added. Government and regional forces have been deployed in the Benishangul-Gumuz region since unarmed groups, suspected to be made up of ethnic Gumuz people in Metekel, targeted government officials and security forces, as well as other ethnic minorities. The region was already host to more than 70,000 Sudanese and South Sudanese refugees and more than 500,000 internally displaced Ethiopians. More than 20,000 refugees have since fled to other areas, according to the UN. In response to the video of the burning, Ethiopia’s government said on Saturday: “A horrific and inhumane act was recently committed” and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. “Regardless of their origin or identity, the government will take legal action against those responsible for this gross and inhumane act.” Yet rights groups have accused the government of failing to adequately investigate alleged abuses by its troops during the conflict, or during spates of intercommunal violence.",News/World news,Video of armed men burning man alive in western Ethiopia sparks outrage,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/video-of-armed-men-burning-man-alive-in-western-ethiopia-sparks-outrage
3/15/2022,"Pre-dawn explosions were heard in the capital Kyiv on Tuesday, as Russia and Ukraine were due to meet again for talks aimed at ending the 20-day war. There were reports that residential apartment blocks were on fire after a Russian missile strike. The attack came one day after one person died and three were hospitalised after a missile partially destroyed a nine-storey block of flats in Kyiv’s Obolon district, with a second person killed later by falling missile fragments on a nearby street. The latest attacks came as Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged disaffected Russian troops to surrender, saying in a late night address on Monday: “We will treat you as humans have to be treated: with dignity. The way you have not been treated in your army. And the way your army doesn’t treat our people.” Talks between Russia and Ukraine will continue on Tuesday, Zelenskiy said, adding that the previous round had gone “pretty well”. While previous negotiations had focused on humanitarian issues, the latest talks aim to achieve a ceasefire, securing Russian troop withdrawals and establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak has said, describing negotiations as “hard”. Russian delegate Leonid Slutsky suggested draft agreements may not be far off. Zelenskiy said on Monday night the war had become a “nightmare” for the Russians, and claimed that more Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine in the past 19 days than in Russia’s two wars in Chechnya combined. “You will take lives – you are many – but yours will be taken too,” he said. Ukrainian armed forces say more than 12,000 Russian troops have been killed since 24 February. The US puts the figure at 5-6,000. The number of Russian personnel killed in Chechnya are not clear but it is thought nearly 6,000 died in the first conflict between 1994-96 and around the same number in the second war between 1999 and 2009. Some estimates are much higher. Despite US concerns that China has already decided to send aid to Moscow, Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, voiced hope that a lack of Russian resources would lead to a peace agreement by May at the latest, with small clashes ongoing possibly for a year. “We are at a fork in the road now: there will either be a peace deal struck very quickly, within a week or two, with troop withdrawal and everything, or there will be an attempt to scrape together some, say, Syrians for a round two and, when we grind them too, an agreement by mid-April or late April,” he said in a video published by several Ukrainian media outlets. Russia has enlisted more than 40,000 Syrians for the conflict, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, with media reports inside Ukraine that the first 400 have arrived at its borders. The observatory said accommodation and training centres had been set up near the border in the Russian region of Rostov, and in Gomel, Belarus. In other developments: Nearly all of the Russian military offensives remained stalled after making little progress over the weekend, according to a senior US defence official. Russian troops were still about 15km (nine miles) from the centre of Kyiv, the official said. China has already decided to provide Russia with economic and financial support and is contemplating sending military supplies such as armed drones, US officials fear. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, laid out the US case against Russia’s invasion in an “intense” seven-hour meeting in Rome with his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi. Zelenskiy praised Russian state media employee Marina Ovsyannikova after she burst on to the set of a live broadcast of the nightly news on Monday evening, shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” Zelenskiy said: “I’m thankful to those Russians who don’t stop trying to deliver the truth.” Spain has temporarily seized a $140m (£108m) superyacht in Barcelona believed to belong to oligarch Sergei Chemezov, a former KGB officer who heads state conglomerate Rostec. More seizures would follow, said prime minister Pedro Sánchez. Ukraine’s president is expected to use his virtual address to Congress in Washington on Wednesday to intensify pressure on Joe Biden to allow the transfer of MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland. He is also likely to repeat a call for Nato to impose a no-fly zone. Biden is considering travelling to Europe in the coming weeks to rally leaders there, according to NBC.
