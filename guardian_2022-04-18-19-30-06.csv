4/18/2022,"When the UK went into lockdown in March 2020, Duncan knew he had to protect himself. Two weeks before the rest of the country was asked to stay at home, he received a call from his team of nurses recommending that he shield. “I’d completed treatment for lymphoma a year earlier and it left me with a compromised immune system,” he says. “I was living with my parents in Cumbria, so we stayed in together.” By October, he had started a university course online and was venturing out for long walks in his spare time, but still being cautious. “I love bird-watching. I took lots of pictures and sometimes sent them to friends,” he says. One of his friends was sharing a student flat in Lancaster with a girl named Molly. “She suggested I send the pictures to Molly as she might like them. I jokingly asked if she was single and discovered she was.” Around a week later, Duncan and Molly connected on Instagram. “I’d been told about him by my flatmate. I think she was secretly trying to set us up,” says Molly. They bonded over a shared love of David Attenborough documentaries and nature. A week later, they set up a short phone call and instantly hit it off. “I found him really interesting and easy to talk to,” she says. Meeting up was difficult as they lived so far apart, and there was no Covid testing available at the time. Eventually, in November, they were able to go for a socially distanced walk. “We couldn’t hold hands or have any intimacy, which was hard, but I knew I wanted to be with her,” says Duncan. “I asked her to be my girlfriend within the first 100 metres of our walk.” Molly was nervous but “really happy … It was hard because I couldn’t even hug him, we had to be so careful.” They continued their long-distance relationship online. “He would put on a suit and I’d wear a nice dress and we’d sit in our living rooms having dinner,” says Molly, laughing. In December, Molly received a negative Covid test and they were finally able to hug. “It was still outdoors but it was so great to be close,” says Duncan. Soon after they met in person, the UK went into its third lockdown. Molly went home to live with her parents in Yorkshire and continued her studies online. Around that time, Duncan’s cancer symptoms returned. “I had some pressure in my neck and at first I thought I might have Covid,” he says. But tests revealed the lymphoma was back and he would need a new course of treatment. In March 2021, before he was due to begin chemotherapy, Molly went to stay with him and his family in Cumbria. “I told her I loved her there and then,” he says. “I also told her it was a lot to deal with, and I would understand if it was all too much.” The next few months were a huge struggle for them both. Duncan’s treatment wasn’t successful, which meant another round of chemotherapy, alongside immunotherapy. “There were lots of ups and downs,” says Molly. “He had anaphylactic shock after one of the treatments and I didn’t hear from him for hours. The chemo became normal but at the same time it really wasn’t. I couldn’t go out much as it meant I couldn’t see him.” As well as struggling with the side-effects of treatment, Duncan also found it difficult to be trapped indoors. “I was so jealous of other people my age going out. We wanted to be a normal 20-year-old couple,” he says. Duncan got the all clear in the summer, but had to have a stem cell transplant and a final round of intense chemotherapy. Now that he’s in remission, Duncan will start university again in September, while Molly continues her studies. “We’re looking forward to doing normal things,” she says. “We have been to the cinema together for the first time and we want to go on holiday. It’s exciting to be able to make plans.” Duncan describes his girlfriend as “a ray of sunshine … She’s been really strong. During the worst of what life could throw at me, Molly was there to make it bearable. She’s also passionate about nature, like me, and gorgeous.” Molly loves that Duncan appreciates her for who she is. “He’s no nonsense and always stands up for himself,” says Molly. “We have been each other’s support system through this trauma and it has made us stronger. He never stops enjoying life.” Want to share your story?

4/18/2022,"This week, the board of governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will gather at its headquarters in Washington DC to reaffirm the Fund’s three-part mandate: financial stability, economic strength, and – as managing director Kristalina Georgieva recently asserted – international solidarity. “I am determined that we will support our members however we can,” Georgieva said of the Fund’s new spirit. “Now is the time to take advantage of this opportunity to build a better world.” Georgieva is right: it is now or never. The “largest spate of debt crises” in a generation hangs over the global South. Two ingredients compose this ticking debt bomb: rapidly rising levels of public debt among the world’s poorest countries, and a rapidly rising percentage of that debt issued at variable interest rates. The combination of these two ingredients mean that even minor rate hikes in rich countries will have explosive consequences across the developing world – just as supply chains seize, food prices soar, and the Covid-19 pandemic rampages through the world’s under-vaccinated populations. In short, the global South has never needed more support in its search for stability, strength and solidarity. But even a cursory glance of the IMF’s global activity reveals a systematic violation of this mandate, inflaming – rather than resolving – the crises of health, hunger and habitat that combine in the world’s poorest countries. Consider Argentina. In 2018, the IMF ignored warnings from its own staff to push through a $57.1bn loan to the Republic of Argentina under President Mauricio Macri: the largest loan in the history of the Fund. Did the loan deliver on the IMF’s mandate of financial stability? The opposite: inflation rose, employment fell and capital fled the country at record rates. Now, well after Macri has been evicted from office, the people of Argentina continue to pay the price. Argentina’s economy minister Martín Guzmán put it bluntly in his letter to Georgieva last month: “None of the objectives of the program were achieved.” What about economic strength? At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the IMF declared its ambition to deploy $1tn to fight the virus, protect the world’s vulnerable populations, and sustain their economies through the global shock. “Very unusual for the IMF,” Georgieva said in April 2020, “I would go out and I would say: ‘please spend’. Spend as much as you can and then spend a little bit more.” Too unusual to be true: of the 85 countries that received pandemic support from the IMF, 73 of them have been forced to undertake austerity measures in the name of “fiscal consolidation”. Last year’s Oxfam report is a world tour of the IMF’s broken promise to build and maintain strong economies: wages cut in Tunisia, welfare retrenched in El Salvador, energy subsidies eliminated in Egypt. IMF austerity does leave the top 10% of earners economically stronger – but only by making the bottom 90 poorer. These statistics spell trouble for the IMF’s solidarity mandate. But perhaps the best illustration of the Fund’s approach to solidarity can be found in its surcharges: the punitive, pro-cyclical and entirely unnecessary fees that the IMF extracts from its most heavily indebted countries. One might imagine the IMF would reduce if not eliminate its surcharges to align with its “new spirit of solidarity”. But again, the opposite: surcharge fees doubled from $1bn to $2bn between 2019 and 2021, while the number of countries facing surcharges rose from 9 to 16. By 2025, the IMF expects that number to rise to 38. The IMF’s surcharges directly target the world’s vulnerable populations. In Ukraine, for example – where Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government struggles to stave off Russian invasion while providing for over seven million displaced people – the Fund will have extracted $423m worth of surcharges in just two years: 25% of the country’s entire healthcare budget. “Surcharges are going exactly against what [the IMF is] supposed to be doing,” Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz said in a recent event at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “It’s supposed to be helping countries ... not extracting extra rents from them because of their dire need.” The IMF’s broken mandate may hit the global South hardest, but its consequences are planetary. In countries like Mongolia and in Mozambique, for example, the IMF is driving coal and gas extraction with tax breaks for fossil fuel corporations. It will be frontline communities in those countries that will suffer the most from climate collapse. But all nations heat in unison. Even the most air-conditioned countries do not have the luxury of ignoring the IMF’s climate record as a problem of the poor alone. How, then, does the IMF get away with it? The Fund is a public institution funded by taxpayer money and controlled by member governments. From Argentina to Ecuador, Pakistan to Egypt, people around the world have risen up to protest IMF measures and demand a different course for the publicly-funded institution. Experts have added legal substance to this widespread outrage, documenting the IMF’s violations of international law and acts of ultra vires. The IMF simply shrugs. “The IMF does not respect UN resolutions or the UN charter,” economist Andrés Arauz told the Progressive International’s Inquiry last week. This is not a secret: in a letter to Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky, independent expert at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the UN, the IMF clearly states the case for its impunity: “The IMF has not accepted the Declaration on Human Rights as the motivating principle of our operations.” The IMF’s abuse of power, then, comes as no surprise. It is a natural response of an institution unmoored from the laws of its member states and the United Nations that connects them. Tweaking the Fund’s mandate will not do the trick. Only strong mechanisms of accountability – changing both who decides and how can end the Fund’s impunity. Fortunately, we have no shortage of proposals for this mechanism, from the UN’s Economic and Social Council to the International Court of Justice. What we have lacked so far is political will – in particular, in the IMF’s largest shareholder and only veto-wielder, the United States of America. Here, we may have cause for optimism. The United States government appears to have rediscovered its passion for human rights, international law, and the UN charter. Perhaps this selective passion will flower into a universal one, and the US will demand the application of these principles to the International Monetary Fund. This week’s Spring meetings provide an opening for such an intervention. But few of the Fund’s Southern members are holding their breath.

4/18/2022,"On a windy winter day in Acoma Pueblo in north-eastern New Mexico, Aaron Lowden knelt beside a field near the San Jose River, the tribe’s primary irrigator for centuries. “The soil has been building up,” said Lowden, an Indigenous seed keeper and farmer, pushing his hand into the soft, dark dirt at the base of a stalk of dried Acoma blue corn. In the summer, this otherwise dry stretch of land turns into a “food forest”, said Lowden, pulling up a photo on his phone showing lush rows of corn, intercropped with Hopi yellow beans, and Acoma winter squash – the “three sisters” of Pueblo agriculture. On the edges of the field are giant heirloom sunflowers – used to attract pollinators – and rows of amaranth. “By companion cropping, you’re replicating those systems you see in nature,” said Lowden, describing the traditional Indigenous practice of interplanting crops to deter weeds and pests, maintain moisture and enrich the soil. “This is thousands of years of knowledge passed down,” he added. For the past decade, Lowden, 34, has worked to restore traditional crops and farming practices in Acoma. As program director for Ancestral Lands, a non-profit that supports land stewardship in Indigenous communities, he reintroduced traditional Acoma crops into the community and created a bank of 57 arid-adapted seeds native to the region. His work is part of a broader movement to build food and seed sovereignty on tribal lands amidst staggering global biodiversity losses created by the modern agricultural system and growing food insecurities caused by climate crisis. “It’s so important that we can bring back our seed diversity,” said Lowden, speaking inside the Ancestral Lands office in Acoma, a few doors down from the seed bank. “To stop monocropping and bring these resilient seeds home.” According to the United Nations, 75% of crop diversity has been lost over the past century as farmers abandoned numerous local varieties of crops for high yield monocultures that are often shoehorned into environments they are poorly adapted to. The Hopi, a sovereign nation in north-eastern Arizona, have been practicing resilient methods of farming for years. “Hopi’s one of the only places I know that corn is made to fit the environment, and not the environment manipulated to fit the corn,” said Dr Michael Kotutwa Johnson, a Hopi dryland farmer and academic from Arizona who relies on passive rain harvesting and drought-resistant seeds to sustain crops. “In agriculture across the world, you could argue that the fundamental problem is remaking the environment to fit products.” “The industrialized food system has failed us,” added Lowden. “We need to restore our food system and that ecological knowledge that has supported us since the beginning.” That ecological knowledge stretches back millennia in the southwest, where farming began as early as 2000 BC. For Lowden, Acoma – the oldest continually inhabited community in North America – is a model of resilience. A community with a holistic, reciprocal and self-sustaining food system, superbly adapted to the high desert and capable of weathering extreme drought, climate change, and violent intrusions by outsiders. In Acoma, “farming is not a hobby”, Lowden said. “It is the basis of our culture and our survival.” Since the arrival of the Spanish, Indigenous culture and food systems have been under constant disruption. Roxanne Swendtzell, an Indigenous seed keeper and sculptor from Santa Clara Pueblo in northern New Mexico, said the story of Native American amaranth is a case in point. The Spanish wanted the Indigenous people to grow wheat and made cultivating amaranth illegal. “You ask most of the people ‘What’s amaranth?’; they don’t even have a memory of it. And yet it was one of our main crops. In this way, so much diversity was lost.” Seed diversity and agriculture knowledge in Acoma, as in many communities, declined as “we shifted from economies of care to cash economies reliant on the national food system”, said Lowden. When Lowden first joined Ancestral Lands in 2011, fifteen or fewer people in all of Acoma were farming, and most were over the age of 40. “They [farmers] were not renewing those seeds and propagating them,” said Lowden. Through the Ancestral Lands Farm Corp, Lowden began to teach Acoma youth traditional farming methods, seed selection and saving, and food preparation. Since 2020 they have had as many as 65 farmers. Last October, farm crew members were working to process the fall harvest. Near the entrance, a group of Acoma youth removed seeds from the heads of massive sunflowers as a layer of Hopi yellow beans dried on a tarp outside. Heirloom gourds covered one corner of the room; Lowden noted that Acoma melons “smell like flowers when they are harvested” and Acoma banana squash, or “Tee-dee-shu-koo-meh daa-nee”, is named for its elongated shape. Another variety, Northern People pumpkin, came from seeds saved by Lowden’s uncle, a traditional Acoma farmer and one of his first teachers. “He told me those [seeds] are your children. Once you put them in the ground, you created that life, so you got to take responsibility,” said Lowden recalling his uncle’s words. “I always teach our young people everything about our food systems, our ways of being, are reciprocal.” Some of the seeds from the harvest will be replanted next season and “grown out”. Others will be put in the seed bank and made available to Black and Indigenous people of color with guidance on how to grow them to minimize hybridization and cross-pollination. Most of the varieties at the seed bank in Acoma were “rematriated” from other seedbanks to their communities of origin. “If your intention was really to care, to take these seeds and maintain the biodiversity, then you should put them back in the rightful hands of the people with know-how,” said Lowden. For Lowden, it is a joyous feeling when a seed variety is returned to the community. “It just feels like a relative coming home,” said Lowden, who recently took the position of Indigenous Seedkeepers Network Program Coordinator at the Native American Food Sovereignty Alliance, a non-profit working to revitalize Indigenous food systems. One of those rematriated crops is Acoma blue corn, which Lowden planted for the first time in 2020. The kernels – shelled into a bright orange Home Depot bucket – range in color from blue to deep purple to almost black. “Our corn relates to the directions and our place in the world,” said Lowden. “It connects to our culture and songs.” Blue corn is a crucial part of the traditional Acoma diet. “There are so many dishes you could name,” said Lowden, listing recipes for blue corn tamales, atole, and parched corn that is “kind of like Corn Nuts”. Lowden showed a traditional blue corn topping called hi-yaa-shru-nee he made and added to red chile stew and served alongside Hopi yellow (tepary) beans for the crew’s lunch. (Dessert was pumpkin pie made from Acoma banana squash.) “We forget how important food is because it’s so accessible to us,” said Lowden as he added the light blue cornflour to a cast iron pan on a stove outside the office. “The food that is accessible to us is so bad for our bodies.” After the outbreak of the pandemic, the farm crew built hoop houses – passive solar cold frames with raised beds – where elders could grow fresh produce into the spring and winter to help address food security. Acoma, like many Indigenous communities, is a food desert. “The closest thing is McDonald’s,” said Lowden, motioning towards the Sky City Casino on interstate 40. The nearest grocery store is 40 miles (64 km) to the north-east. The lack of access to healthy, affordable food has led to significant health disparities in Indigenous communities, including nutrition-related chronic diseases. In 2015, internationally renowned sculptor Roxanne Swentzell started the Pueblo Food Experience project where, for three months, participants from Santa Clara Pueblo ate only foods available before European contact to see the potential health benefits. The 14 volunteers had health problems ranging from diabetes to heart disease and cancer. “You name it, we had it,” she said. A doctor examined the group before and after the three months. “The results of the pre-contact diet,” said Swentzell, was profound. “All the different health issues, every single one of them improved.” Swentzell attributes the health benefits, in part, to the co-evolution of the people to the foods and animals in the environment. “I once read that it takes 20 generations in the same location for species (human included) to genetically adapt to that environment,” wrote Swentzell in the Pueblo Food Experience Cookbook she published in 2016. “If we’ve been in a place without moving for 20 generations, eating the plants and animals that have been there for more than 20 generations, then everything starts to really align up,” Swentzell said. “Most of these older varieties have proven to be superior in nutrition, less water demanding, and adaptable to climate,” said Clayton Broscoupe, a Mohawk traditional farmer, seed saver, and one of the founders of the Traditional Native American Farmers Association (TNAFA). “The more we’re using those varieties we have, the better off we will be.” Climate-resilient crops and water-conserving farming techniques could be critical amid growing heat, drought, and water scarcity in the south-west. “That’s one of the biggest things,” said Lowden of traditional farming in Acoma. “I feel it can be our biggest response to climate change,” said Lowden. Unlike most conventional farms, the field in Acoma is irrigated only twice a month and not at all if it rains. “We wait until the corn kind of shows us when it really, really needs the water,” said Lowden. “The Acoma varieties thrive. We always get something.” In 2016, the Ancestral Lands Farm Corps planted a dryland field. Once widely practiced in Acoma, this form of farming uses passive rainwater harvesting to sustain superbly arid-adapted crops. “We had three successful harvests,” said Lowden, who hopes to plant another field this summer. “It was almost an extinct practice.”​​ The Hopi, located in north-east Arizona, are the masters of this practice, growing successful fields in a region that receives an average of 8.5 in of rain annually. “All of our agricultural techniques are designed to preserve soil moisture,” said Micheal Kotutwa, standing outside his house near the town of Kykotsmoviin in north-eastern Arizona. “I think one of the biggest differences between traditional agriculture and conventional agriculture is that ours is based upon survival.” For Lowden, farming is also a matter independence. “We are a nation here. We are not just Americans, we are Acoma. [A] big part of keeping that sovereignty is whether you can feed your people.”",News/Environment,"Blue corn and melons: meet the seed keepers reviving ancient, resilient crops ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/18/seed-keeper-indigenous-farming-acoma
4/18/2022,"There are, of course, legends about zuccotto, the dome-shaped, ricotta-filled sponge pudding. One is that Bernardo Buontalenti, the architect who designed ice houses for the Medici family, also designed for them a semifreddo pudding using a metal artillery helmet, or zuccotto, as a form. Another is that, because its shape and sponge (stained with alchermes liqueur) resemble an ecclesiastical zuccotto (scarlet skullcap), it was named after that. Or is it a sponge tribute to Florence’s duomo? It hardly matters, even if nobody really believes it – the narrative is so attractive that it satisfies in any case. I do like the legend about Buontalenti, though: architect, theatrical designer, military engineer and the man credited with inventing Italian gelato. Where was he when he had the stroke of genius for using a metal helmet as a mould for a frozen cream pudding? In searching my own house for a suitable mould, I did wonder about using my son’s plastic helmet, but only briefly, before setting on a small one-and-a-half-litre metal bowl. Sadly not copper, which is what Giovanni Righi Parenti suggests in his detailed book about Tuscan food. He gives two recipes for zuccotto – both sponge-lined domes with toasted nuts and candied fruit; one with a filling of cream, the other of ricotta. For soaking the sponge, he offers seven alcoholic options: strega, Bénédictine, rum, Grand Marnier, creme de cacao, cherry brandy, or alchermes – the only one we have at home; a bottle bought four years ago and gathering dust at the back of a bookcase. According to Darra Goldstein in the Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets, the first recorded recipe for alchermes is from ancient Baghdad, and it called for apple juice, gold leaf, cinnamon, musk, pearls, rosewater, sugar, aloes, and chermes (AKA cochineal – a blood-red dye skilfully extracted from a small parasitic insect of the same name). This precious tonic was prescribed for heart palpitations, and as a treatment for melancholy and madness. The recipe then travelled to Europe, where it was adapted, most notably by rennaissance Florence’s Officina Profumo Farmaceutica, into its confectio alchermes, an infusion of cochineal, spices, rose and honey in alcohol, which became a precious renaissance remedy of prodigious strength. In his scandalous 18th-century memoir, the librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte recounts how, after being dragged more dead than alive from a carriage after an accident, three glasses of alchermes made him a new man. Cochineal was and remains an important ingredient and industry in Peru and the Canary Islands. Since 2009, it has to be clearly labelled as a food colourant because it is an allergen for a small number of people. For your zuccotto, of course, you don’t have to use alchermes; you have a mini-bar of options for your sponge dome, a slice of which not only calms and reassures, but also brings joy.

4/18/2022,"Homelessness has become the central issue for every candidate vying to be the next mayor of Los Angeles. The humanitarian disaster in America’s second largest city has reached catastrophic levels in the two years since the start of the pandemic, but that has not stopped the frontrunner in the race, US Congresswoman Karen Bass, from promising to accomplish what has long seemed impossible: solve the crisis. The extraordinary challenge facing LA was what prompted Bass not to seek re-election in Congress, she told the Guardian last week. “It is the number one reason why I decided to come back and run for mayor … It has gotten completely out of hand.” Unveiling her homelessness platform in January, Bass made bold commitments: if elected, she would “end all street encampments”. She would provide housing to 15,000 unhoused people by the end of year one; rapidly get people off the street; convert empty properties into shelter; and build more permanent supportive housing. Speaking last week, Bass said the city had historically approached homelessness like it was a “chronic disease”: “You know it’s not going to go away and that you’re going to have to take medicine for the rest of your life. The city and the county have treated the problem without even the consideration that it could or should be solved … it has now exploded or metastasized.” Bass’s diagnosis builds on her early career as an emergency room physician assistant in an LA county hospital, where she treated unhoused people. In 1990, she founded the Community Coalition, a South LA non-profit organization focused on substance abuse and violence prevention. At that time, she argued addiction was a public health crisis while other Democrats pushed for criminalization. As she rose in politics – from California state representative, to state assembly speaker, to US congresswoman, to Joe Biden’s shortlist to become vice-president – the housing crisis in her home town dramatically worsened. Now, more than 41,000 people are unhoused in the city, and nearly four unhoused people die every day. LA county is home to 40% of all unhoused people in California, and 20% of all unhoused people living outside in the US, as of 2020. “The number one thing I would do differently is treat this like a natural disaster,” Bass said. “If you have an earthquake … you go into action, and you don’t let bureaucracy stand in your way, because you understand that people are dying.” Bass is not the first official to push for urgency and promise to “cut through red tape”. The outgoing mayor, Eric Garcetti, has called for a “Fema-like response” to homelessness. Most candidates looking to replace him have promised dramatic and decisive change, though they have remained vague on how exactly they will reduce the rising number of people living outside. Bass’s “emergency” response includes appointing a homelessness chief to create a better partnership between the city (which is responsible for housing) and the LA county government (which oversees social services). She has also pledged to prevent homelessness by promoting rental assistance and direct cash assistance: “I believe very strongly in assistance for landlords, it’s not enough just to assist the tenants,” she said. To get people off the streets, Bass said she would create more temporary housing on city-owned sites and in vacant properties. Bass’s proposals have been closely scrutinized, with skeptics questioning how she will succeed in finding housing for tens of thousands of people or clearing tent communities without violating unhoused people’s rights. Other critics have argued her plan didn’t offer substantially new solutions. Some experts have criticized her focus on expanding temporary shelter, and questioned whether that approach can get people indoors en masse – and keep them off the streets. Carolina Reid, faculty research adviser at UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation, said there was research consensus in support of the “housing first” model, which prioritizes providing permanent housing for unhoused people over requiring them to go through temporary programs and services before offering a more permanent home: “We know what makes a difference – give people housing, and that over time can stabilize them.” In addition, data has shown how LA has repeatedly failed to transition people from temporary solutions into long-term housing; UCLA researchers recently found that one year after the shutdown of a major encampment at Echo Park Lake, only 17 out of 183 residents were confirmed to be in stable housing. One resident told the Guardian he spent a full year waiting in a temporary program only to return to an encampment. Several unhoused people said they were kicked out of temporary programs due to strict rules without getting an opportunity for housing. Bass said she supported the concept of “housing first”, but also argued that interim programs were necessary: “Ending street encampments comes with adequate, safe and secure temporary housing.” She said she avoids the word “shelter”, because often “that is where plans end”. “It’s pathetic when being on the street is better than being in a shelter. Obviously that is crying for a new design of shelters,” she said, noting that the pandemic showed the importance of giving people private spaces instead of group shelters with rows of cots. She offered few specifics on how she would get 15,000 people housed in a year, but said it would require temporary placements, permanent housing and other programs. She added she would improve the process for housing vouchers that subsidize low-income rent, so that people who have received the vouchers can actually get rentals. Pete White, executive director of the Los Angeles Community Action Network, who advocates for the unhoused, said he was glad Bass was pushing for more efficient ways to build permanent housing and looking to use government land. But he added: “I’m not happy about seeing arbitrary numbers and promises to remove houseless folks from sight, without having an accompanying plan for that number of units to be developed. “Unfortunately, Candidate Bass and pretty much all the other candidates are producing plans that we’ve seen and heard before in Los Angeles”, he said. White and other experts lamented the lack of proposals from the mayoral candidates on preventing evictions as a means of keeping people off the streets. And he was concerned that the effort to get 15,000 off the street would mean a law enforcement crackdown, he said. At a recent debate, Bass came out strongly against criminalizing the unhoused, a contrast to Rick Caruso, the billionaire real estate developer who has risen in the polls, which show him tied with Bass, after putting $10m of his money into the campaign. Caruso threatened that when the unhoused don’t accept an offer of a “dry bed and warm food”, they should be forced to leave the streets: “You have to move that encampment.” Candidate Joe Buscaino, a councilman and former policeman, pledged to use police to sweep unhoused camps, saying, “We have been a city that has been enabling this behavior … that’s been a welcoming mat for the rest of the country to come to LA, pitch a tent, take drugs in public.” Data counters his claims, showing the majority of unhoused people in the region became unhoused due to economic hardship, and two-thirds were living in LA when they fell into homelessness. LA county says 32% of unhoused people living outside report substance abuse and 26% report long-term mental health conditions. Mari Castaldi, senior legislative advocate on homelessness for Housing California, an advocacy organization, noted that housing affordability was the primary cause of the crisis: “Mayors fall back on the public perception that homelessness is driven by mental illness and substance abuse, and a significant source of crime in our state, but the data doesn’t support that. Mayors often have limited tools to produce affordable housing at scale, and so they turn to policing, criminalization and sweeps.” Bass told the Guardian she wanted to push back against the narrative that the majority of encampment residents were “hardcore drug users” who “choose to be on the streets and don’t want to get clean”. And she said she did not want to mislead voters into believing a police crackdown would work: “Even though that might make you feel good, because that person leaves your block, either they’re going to be right back in three days, or somebody else will be there. You can’t arrest your way out of this.” So how will she “end all encampments” without criminalization? “The best way to end encampments is to have very consistent and aggressive outreach that is led by people who are trained and formerly unhoused,” Bass said, though adding, “I have no doubt that some people in those encampments that are violating the law can wind up arrested.” And how long will this take? “I’d love to say I will end [encampments] within the first year, but if you want me to just pick a date, I’d be pulling it out of the air. I’d say within two years, but I like to make statements based on data and I’m reluctant to say that, because I would be purely speculating. One thing I would not say, though, is that they are going to be there for years. Because I don’t believe that they have to.”",News/US news,‘A metastasizing crisis’: can Karen Bass end street encampments in LA?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/18/karen-bass-los-angeles-mayor-candidate-homelessness
4/18/2022,"James Duval, the man who played Frank the Rabbit in Donnie Darko, is the star of this intriguing stoner comedy-drama, whose wacky/terrifying premise almost lives up to the legendary interdimensional bunny. He plays Sid, an inveterate LA toker and online gamer (Challenger is his digital ID) who, 40 years old and going nowhere, decides to bury himself alive and livestream the ordeal on the internet. Based on the YouTube videos of some Russians who’ve done the same thing, he believes it will bring him good luck. The ploy is all the more surprising, because for the first half-hour writer-director Paul Boyd keeps us firmly in Lebowski land. Sid is Echo Park’s resident friendly neighbourhood dealer, handing out complimentary joints to the schoolkids he sells kush to. After being replaced by a robot in his last job and with his rent in arrears, he’s resigned to being “a loser”. He can’t even win at Tinder: he finishes a date cable-tied to the bed by a dominatrix. He’s eventually freed by Logan (Coy Stewart), the twentysomething gaming partner who agrees to supervise the burial. I, Challenger is at its best when it plays the self-interment idea just seriously enough, hovering on the edge of absurdity. But tonally Boyd is a bit uncertain, letting Duval go too big with the bachelor pothead shtick in the early stages (he smokes a joint that pivots back and forth on a rotator fan). That it’s hard to sustain any comedy once Sid is six feet under and fretting over his mobile signal is understandable – though the film remains fundamentally too affable to ruthlessly extract the high tension of the likes of 2010’s Buried. Despite this, I, Challenger always retains the kind of well-meaning brothers-under-the-herb optimism of the stoner genre, while being more imaginative than most. Duval, who makes an endearing dummy, has a great hallucination scene where he’s beamed up into a gaming laptop looming over the LA horizon like an Independence Day spaceship. But surely they should have called the film Dude, Where’s My Coffin?  I, Challenger is released in cinemas on 22 April.",Arts/Film,"I, Challenger review – endearing stoner hero gets buried alive",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/18/i-challenger-review-endearing-stoner-hero-gets-buried-alive
4/18/2022,"MPs still have significant concerns about their safety six months on from the murder of David Amess, with many warning there is a “backlog” of issues waiting to be resolved that have left their homes and offices unsecure. Despite the parliamentary authorities’ vow in October to keep MPs “as safe as possible”, many of those who spoke to the Guardian said the situation had only got worse. Speaking anonymously, they blamed a “shambolic” handover between the previous and current security contractor, saying outstanding requests for safety measures had piled up and been delayed further by assessments of what equipment they needed having to be redone. “If things stay the same … it feels like not a case of if something horrific will happen again, but when,” one warned. Another said: “If someone wanted to break in to my office and murder all my staff, it would be very easy to do so.” Even MPs who had experienced few issues themselves said they still believed the system was a lottery. “I’ve been quite lucky,” one admitted. Although parliament’s previous security contractor, Chubb, was ditched after MPs aired their dismay, there were complaints that security equipment requested nearly a year ago had still not been installed by the successor firm, ADT. A source said the handover was a “complete farce”, as ADT had not been given paperwork such as previous security audits of MPs’ homes and offices, while Chubb “won’t communicate with us”. One Conservative MP said that despite multiple calls to ADT, their constituency office’s security had remained precarious for eight months because a burglar alarm had been installed that did not work – but they could not manage to get a code needed to activate it from Chubb. Another said they had been waiting 10 months for basic security equipment at their home, including a CCTV camera and lights. A third admitted: “The consensus is that it’s very similar to the previous contractor and that nothing has really changed.” A Labour MP also said only half the security measures they needed had been implemented. “Nothing happens fast enough and the handover from Chubb to ADT was not smooth,” they said. “Security teams don’t always take issues seriously and it often takes repeated calls for action.” Kim Leadbeater, the MP for the Batley and Spen seat that her sister Jo Cox represented until she was killed in 2016, said were still “inefficiencies in the system around practical measures of protection”. She said she had been “reassured that those are being dealt with” and that it was a “big job” to get the security right for all 650 MPs, their family and staff members. Leadbeater added that MPs should be accessible to the public and it was a “real challenge” to “get that balance right”. As well improving security for MPs, she said it was important to change “the culture around politics” to “make it a more civilised place and a less dangerous place to be”. As well as security equipment, MPs said support from police also varied between local forces. They said that letting officers know where they would be in advance took up a lot of staff admin and the messages sometimes received no response. Parliament’s head of security was also forced to write to MPs last month, admitting that “many of you had concerns” when a late-night Commons sitting coincided with a strike on the London underground. Those who tried to catch taxis home afterwards described “having to wait at the exact spot where PC Keith Palmer was murdered” during the 2017 Westminster Bridge terror attack, or walk to a cab rank 20 minutes away in Victoria. A parliament spokesperson said MPs being able to do their job safely was “fundamental to our democracy” and that work was continuing with the Metropolitan police and local forces. They added: “We cannot comment on MPs’ security arrangements or advice because we would not wish to compromise the safety of MPs, parliamentary staff or members of the public, but these are kept under continuous review.” ADT and Chubb have been approached for comment.",News/Politics,MPs’ safety fears remain six months after David Amess murder,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/18/mps-safety-fears-remain-six-months-after-david-amess
4/18/2022,"The Liberal MP for the seat of North Sydney, Trent Zimmerman, asked the prime minister’s office to dump controversial candidate Katherine Deves because of her comments on transgender issues. According to multiple sources, Zimmerman appealed last week to senior members of the prime minister’s office and to party officials for Morrison to dump Deves because of inflammatory comments she has made on various social media platforms about the transgender community. On Monday, in response to questions from Guardian Australia about the request, Zimmerman said he would “never comment on private discussions”. The prime minister’s office declined to comment. The direct appeal to the prime minister’s office to dump the controversial candidate for Tony Abbott’s former seat of Warringah is understood to have fallen on deaf ears, prompting the NSW treasurer and senior moderate, Matt Kean, to make the appeal publicly on Thursday. Kean had said that Deves should be disendorsed, saying “there is no place in a mainstream political party for bigotry”. “Political leaders should be condemning the persecution of people based on their gender, not participating in it.” But in response, Morrison said he would not partake in the Deves “pile-on”, saying she had apologised. “I don’t share Matt’s view. I share Tony Abbott’s view. I’m not joining that pile-on and she has learned from her experiences … and I have no doubt she will pursue these issues in a more sensitive way,” he said. “As you are going forward as a candidate you need to know the things that perhaps, in your past, you shouldn’t be doing the same way.” “It is important she understands that and learns those lessons which she has.” Deves was one of a number of “captain’s pick” candidates chosen by Morrison to run in 13 electorates – in her case, in Warringah, against the independent MP, Zali Steggall – after a stalled and viciously contested preselection process left the party without candidates in key seats. Zimmerman’s appeal is the latest in a string of Liberals who want Deves dumped, with other moderate Liberals in NSW including Dave Sharma in Wentworth and senator Andrew Bragg also understood to be deeply concerned about her candidacy. Sharma, who faces a challenge from Allegra Spender in his seat of Wentworth, liked Kean’s statement on Twitter, but would not comment on whether he had also contacted the prime minister’s office to call for her to be disendorsed. Spender criticised Sharma for not calling out Deves, saying he needed to “stand up for his community and condemn Katherine Deves’ disgusting comments”. The call from Zimmerman comes amid ongoing furore about Deves’ comments about the trans community, and as moderate Liberal MPs fear the issue will prove an unwelcome distraction as they seek to keep their seats against independents backed by Climate 200. Guardian Australia has reported that Deves described Wear it Purple Day as a “grooming tactic” promoting “extreme body modification” on her now-deleted website. She also repeatedly misgendered a New Zealand trans athlete, Laurel Hubbard, and suggested a young boy could ask to “remove his penis” after attending a respectful relationships workshop at school. It came after News.com.au reported Deves had also deleted social media accounts on which she described trans children as “surgically mutilated and sterilised” and said she was “triggered” by the LGBTQ+ rainbow flag. Deves also apologised for some of those posts, saying that her comments were “not acceptable”. “My advocacy for the rights and safety of women and girls is well known, and I stand by my desire to ensure we protect the safety of women and girls and our entire community,” she said in a statement. “However, the language I used was not acceptable, and for that I apologise.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The NSW senator and foreign minister, Marise Payne, was repeatedly asked on Sunday whether she supported Deves for the seat, with nominations due to be finalised by Tuesday. “I don’t share Ms Deves’ comments that she has made, but importantly she has apologised and withdrawn those views,” Senator Payne told ABC’s Insiders program. Asked if she should be dumped, Payne said: “Ms Deves is the Liberal candidate and that is the approach we are taking.” Senior government sources said that dumping Deves was not a “consequence-free” decision, however, and could lead to further distractions for the party. There is also doubt about who would take her place in the event she was disendorsed, with suggestions the party could instead “run dead” in the seat, which is held by Steggall on a 7.2% margin.",News/Australia news,Trent Zimmerman joins Liberals calling for Scott Morrison to dump Katherine Deves over trans comments,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/18/trent-zimmerman-joins-liberals-calling-for-scott-morrison-to-dump-katherine-deves-over-trans-comments
4/18/2022,"The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has sought to refocus his campaign on the failings of the Morrison government, taking to flood-affected parts of Brisbane to criticise the Coalition’s natural disaster response. Opening the second week of the election campaign in the Coalition-held seat of Brisbane, Albanese and shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, also tried to pressure the government over its support for Medicare, using the appointment of Anne Ruston as future health minister to accuse the Liberals of wanting to cut health spending. Ruston, who on Sunday ruled out cuts to Medicare after being grilled on remarks made in 2015 about the system being “unsustainable”, was asked multiple times on Monday to rule out cuts to Medicare. “We absolutely guaranteed Medicare in law,” Ruston told the ABC, without categorically ruling out cuts. “Medicare is sustainable,” Ruston said. “The fact [is] that we have increased spending on Medicare from when Labor was last in government in 2012-13, from $19bn to $31.4bn in 22-23.” At the time Ruston made the remarks about Medicare being unsustainable, she was a backbench senator defending an Abbott-era policy for a GP co-payment that was later dumped. But Albanese said the appointment would lead to a government that would “undermine Medicare” and cut health spending. “This is a health minister now designate, if they’re successful in the election, who we know will undermine Medicare, who has said that the current model is not sustainable, who has said that Medicare funding is just putting things on the credit card and that it needs to change,” Albanese said. “If Scott Morrison is re-elected, we can expect cuts to health, cuts to education, cuts to other essential services – because this is a prime minister who only defines action by what’s in the short-term political interests of himself.” Chalmers said Morrison’s pick of Ruston would “send a shiver down the spine of every Australian who needs affordable health care”. “The prime minister’s hand-picked health minister was given multiple opportunities this morning to rule out further cuts to Medicare and she couldn’t do it. Medicare is not safe under Scott Morrison and Anne Ruston.” Labor’s targeted message on the threat to health spending, which is reminiscent of the 2016 Mediscare campaign run against Malcolm Turnbull, was backed up by Labor MPs posting about Ruston’s remarks on social media. On the floods, Albanese said Morrison has only acted when “the political pressure was really put on”, likening the response to the government’s failings after the black summer bushfires and the pandemic. “On floods, we saw again a political response, rather than a human response, rather than looking at people who were going through a really tough time and saying, ‘what can we do to help?’” But while Albanese was keen to refocus the campaign on the government’s record, the Labor leader also faced questions about the party’s pledge to establish 50 urgent care clinics across the country. The $135m health policy has drawn a lukewarm response from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and criticism from the Australian Medical Association, who say the policy is “incoherent” and will do nothing to address the logjam in public hospitals. Albanese was unable to say how many doctors and nurses the 50 clinics would require, and the party has not yet released costings for the policy which it claims are based on work done by the parliamentary budget office. Labor has so far pledged that one of the clinics will be established in Cessnock, in the seat of Hunter, and seven of the clinics will be built in WA. “Well, we’re going to need additional nurses and doctors,” Albanese said. “These won’t be run by the government. These won’t be run centrally. These will come through – these will be determined by the people who run the centres, which is existing GP clinics and community health centres”. Morrison, who was announcing a $124m shipbuilding commitment in Perth, moved to tidy up Ruston’s remarks, saying the government had increased Medicare spending from $19.1bn to $31.4bn. “I thought Anne Ruston – who I announced [as health minister] yesterday, should we be successful at the election … said yesterday there would not be any cuts. And I would repeat that today.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He also wrongly claimed the jobseeker payment had been increased from $40 a week to $46 a week while answering a question about the cost of living, rather than $46 a day. He later said he misspoke. With published polls showing a tightening of the contest in the run-up to the 21 May election, Morrison also left the door open to negotiating with independent MPs on the crossbench to form government. However, he said that he still expected moderate MPs being challenged by climate-friendly independents to win their seats, and warned against voting independent. “A vote for those independents is a vote for uncertainty, a vote for instability,” he said.",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese shifts campaign focus to perceived failings of Morrison government,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/18/anthony-albanese-shifts-campaign-focus-to-perceived-failings-of-morrison-government
