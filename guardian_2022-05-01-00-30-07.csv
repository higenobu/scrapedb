5/1/2022,"Another grand slam for England, a fourth consecutive Six Nations title, a 23rd win in a row and a considerable statement that they will take some stopping at this year’s World Cup. Whereas they had previously thrashed their opponents, this was a victory founded on their tireless defence and, fittingly for the side who can fully lay claim to the label, professionalism. They scored three tries each from rolling mauls with the tighthead prop Sarah Bern going over twice and Abbie Ward grabbing the other and while there were more moments from France – who were also chasing a clean sweep – that quickened the pulse, England demonstrated the kind of performance that demonstrates why they are significantly ahead of the chasing pack at present. They had spoken in the buildup about how they wanted a genuine challenge and the boos that rang out Stade Jean Bauger as they completed their warm-up served as warning as to what was to come. Indeed, it was a jittery start by England, a relentless opening from France and for the first time in the competition, the three-times defending champions were behind. After just three minutes the France No 8 Romane Ménager burst through the England defence and under the posts after the hosts were afforded a lineout deep in their opponents’ territory after a knock-on from Zoe Harrison behind her own line. England’s stage fright continued thereafter with Lydia Thompson fumbling a wayward pass from Helena Rowland but it was the full-back’s expertly executed 50:22 which gave her side their first foray into the France 22. It was England’s first genuine opportunity and one they took, Bern finishing off her first try at the back of a rolling maul. By this stage Alex Matthews, winning her 50th cap, had bandaging around her head after a collision left her face covered in blood – if England had wanted a step up in intensity that was precisely what they were getting. Bern’s try settled them, however, and with Zoe Aldcroft persistent at disrupting France’s lineout, England began to exert their authority.. Two more tries from rolling mauls – the first from Ward, who had won the penalty to give the visitors possession – and another from Bern demonstrated just what a cohesive unit Simon Middleton has built. France were not without their moments – Chloe Jacquet’s booming left boot kept England’s back-three honest – but the home side’s indiscipline let them down on too many occasions and when they were able to get territory, more often than not Aldcroft intervened. England were on top at the breakdown too but perhaps it is the way his side dealt with the sustained period of French pressure before half-time that will please Middleton most. Whereas England’s maul had been clinical, France could not find a way through despite repeated attempts. A converted try would have taken them in at the interval within a score but you sensed England’s ability to stand firm was among the most telling points in the match. They can perhaps count themselves lucky no penalty try nor yellow card was awarded but then the same could be said of France earlier in the half. Again France flew out of the blocks at the start of the second half and they could sense a way back into the match when Harrison was shown a yellow card for a deliberate knock-on. A fine break through the middle from Gabrielle Vernier had England reeling but that France failed to score a point during that 10-minute period only emphasised how resolute the visitors were in defence. A yellow card for France’s Maelle Filopon allowed Emily Scarratt to extend England’s lead with a penalty but the visitors went up a gear despite their numerical disadvantage. The replacement Emilie Boulard sparked things off, bursting through the heart of England’s defence and les Bleues kept coming, eventually registering their second try of the match through Annaelle Deshayes. It was fitting reward for their efforts but there was no grandstand finish for France, who, if nothing else, now know precisely the levels they must aspire to.",Sport/Sport,England’s women sink France to secure another Six Nations grand slam,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/30/englands-women-sink-france-to-secure-another-six-nations-grand-slam
5/1/2022,"Coroebus, at 5-1, surged into the lead over a furlong out and then comfortably held off the late run of his stable companion Native Trail, the 5-4 favourite, to win the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, giving Charlie Appleby his first success in the race and James Doyle, the winning rider, his first win in a British Classic. Coroebus was always travelling easily and was sent for home as Royal Patronage, who had set a strong pace for the first three quarters of a mile, started to drop away. Native Trail, who had been drawn on the opposite side of the track to the winner, never looked likely to close the gap when Willliam Buick sent the previously unbeaten colt – and last season’s champion juvenile – in pursuit. He crossed the line three-quarters of a length adrift of Coroebus, with Aidan O’Brien’s Luxembourg, who ran on strongly having been some way off the pace at halfway, putting down a useful marker for the Derby on 4 June, as he finished another length and a half away in third. Luxembourg, a son of the strong stayer Camelot, was cut from 3-1 to 11-4 by Coral for the Epsom Classic, while Coroebus, who is more likely to stay at around a mile, is 10-1 from 16-1. “He [Native Trail] was just beaten by a better horse,” Appleby said afterwards. “I could see James was travelling for fun and that’s what this horse does, he’s a seven-furlong horse that could potentially get a bit further than a mile in time. You can’t take anything away from Native Trail, he’s gone down on his sword, but one horse had been there and done it and one had the scope to potentially go and do it. “On the evidence of what we’ve seen today, they are the best two three-year-old colts around, so after discussions over the next few weeks, one will probably go to Ireland [for the Irish 2,000 Guineas] and one will probably keep the powder dry and go straight to the St James’s Palace [Stakes at Royal Ascot in June].” There is an Inspiral-shaped hole in the field for the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket after last year’s joint-champion juvenile filly was ruled out of the Classic last week, but in her absence, it is a more open and engaging puzzle for punters to solve with Aidan O’Brien’s Tenebrism, the Cheveley Park Stakes winner, heading the market at around 3-1. Tenebrism’s success over the last six furlongs of the Rowley Mile in September is the best piece of form on offer, but she is by a sprinter and out of a miler, and has another two furlongs to cover on Sunday. It is difficult to take her stamina on trust at relatively short odds, and all the more so when there are a host of alternatives, ranging from fillies with Group One form as juveniles – Discoveries, Malavath, Zellie and Wild Beauty – to lightly-raced fillies with scope for significant improvement. Tuesday (3.40), a stable companion of Tenebrism, is from the latter group, but was touched off by Discoveries, the subsequent Moyglare winner, on debut in June before winning a maiden in a canter at Naas in March. With plenty of improvement likely, she is an attractive bet at around 6-1 to emulate her full sister, Minding, the Guineas winner in 2016. Newmarket 1.50: Cemhaan showed plenty of improvement from four to five on his return at Salisbury last month and has an obvious chance to follow up under a 5lb penalty. Newmarket 2.25: Seven lightly-raced runners for the Pretty Polly Stakes with any amount of improvement to come. Crenelle’s race-fitness may just tip the balance in her favour. Hamilton 2.35: Gis A Sub has several pounds in hand of his three rivals on his form in last season’s Gimcrack at York and that should be enough for a successful three-year-old debut.

5/1/2022,"What is talent? There is a tendency to prioritise what looks good over what works, to be wowed by a player with grace rather than somebody effective, to rave about a footballer who can swoop by another with a sway of the hips or in a blur of feet, or who can caress a shot into the top corner, and to be slightly dismissive of those whose game seems based on graft, who have through dedication and focus made the most of their gifts. At which, enter two exhibits, the two captains at St James’ Park: Newcastle’s Jonjo Shelvey and Jordan Henderson of Liverpool. They arrived at Anfield a year apart, Shelvey as a highly rated 18-year-old who had already amassed 42 league games for Charlton, Henderson as a 20-year-old worth £16m. There was a time when they represented a possible future for the centre of the Liverpool midfield: both scored in a 4-1 win over Chelsea in May 2012, in what turned out to be Kenny Dalglish’s last home game as manager. At that point, Shelvey was arguably the better prospect. He had a grace and a poise, a right foot capable of delicious passes. Henderson was a trier who, as Alex Ferguson noted, had a slightly odd way of running. That he happened to be an excellent crosser of the ball had largely been forgotten after Steve Bruce had moved him from the right into the centre of midfield. It was Shelvey who appeared the more talented. But then talent can take many forms. In 2013 the former England cricket captain Mike Atherton wrote a column on the retirement of Mark Ramprakash. It wasn’t hard to detect a slight note of irritation as he discussed how “talented” Ramprakash was perceived to be. “If [talent],” he wrote, “is generally defined as possessing either a natural gift, or a capacity for success, then our game invariably tags as talented those who enjoy the gift, but not necessarily the success.” Ramprakash, for all his talent, averaged 27.32 in Test cricket and made just two centuries. Atherton contrasted him with Graeme Smith and Alastair Cook (“hard-working, focused, driven, effective, pragmatic”), who made far more runs at far higher averages. Atherton then cited the Swedish psychologist K Anders Ericsson who, he said, had demonstrated “that elite performance is almost always the result of ferocious hard work, relentless self-improvement and specific, rigorous practice – all within a cultural context in which the appetite for self-improvement can flourish. In other words, few have reached the top without putting in the hours.” And of course, behind it all, what Atherton was really talking about was himself and the way his ability had consistently been demeaned throughout his career by the idea that he was mentally tough, that he could grind out ugly runs. But which is worth more, a cover drive of such fluency it sends a flutter through the guts of even the most hardened observer, or the ability to face down Allan Donald for hours and occasionally nudge the ball off the pads for four? But that, Atherton argued, was his talent, citing Friedrich Nietzsche to make his case: “All great artists and thinkers are great workers, indefatigable not only in inventing but also in rejecting, sifting, transforming and ordering.” That was why he (Atherton, not Nietzsche) scored 16 Test centuries and averaged 37.69. Henderson, it hardly needs saying, is the Atherton in this analogy. As Henderson has grafted his way to enormous success and 69 caps for England, making the most of his talent, Shelvey has drifted, an inconsistent figure, almost as notable for his temper as anything else. There was a moment early in the second half when a loose ball spun between the two captains. Henderson, of course, was sharper to it. He made nearly twice as many passes as Shelvey over the game at a far higher accuracy, including the swift forward pass to Naby Keïta that eventually led to the only goal. Perhaps Shelvey has been the more graceful player through his career, perhaps he is in that sense the more talented. But it is Henderson who has captained teams to the Premier League and Champions League, and this season still has the chance to do both for a second time.",Sport/Football,Liverpool’s Jordan Henderson wins captains’ duel with Jonjo Shelvey | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/30/liverpools-jordan-henderson-wins-captains-duel-with-jonjo-shelvey
5/1/2022,"New hydropower schemes to help transform and preserve some of the country’s historic watermills face being wrecked by a huge increase in application fees, energy campaigners warn. Some watermills have already had turbines installed to generate clean electricity, but campaigners say there are hundreds more across Britain which could be converted to hydropower to help conserve the sites and power the nation. The Environment Agency now faces criticism for discouraging small-scale hydropower schemes which can be installed in watermills after increasing application costs on 1 April in England from £1,500 to fees ranging from £6,110 to £13,392 – in some cases, a 790% increase. A decade ago, the application fee for a hydropower scheme was just £135. The money is not returned for an unsuccessful application, meaning many potential schemes are likely to be unaffordable. Sir Jonathon Porritt, the environmental campaigner and former director of Friends of the Earth, said: “At a time when we should all be doing everything we can to promote sustainable renewable electricity, the fact that the Environment Agency has become the biggest threat to maintaining and restoring traditional watermills is truly shocking. “There has to be a change of heart before this reckless vandalism causes further damage.” Watermills were built in Britain in Roman times, and by the 11th century there were more than 6,000 across the country. Most mills were used to grind corn, and in the second half of the 18th century many were built to power the mechanised cotton industry. There were more than 20,000 watermills in Britain by the 19th century, adapted for a range of uses from powering forge hammers to paper manufacture and grinding bones for fertiliser. Many were later abandoned and fell into ruin. Recent years have seen a drive to repurpose watermill sites into hydropower schemes, with many successful projects across the country. Rupert Armstrong Evans, 72, an engineer who lives at the 600-year-old Trecarrell Mill on the River Inny near Launceston in Cornwall, said he wanted a new hydropower scheme to replace a previous outdated installation, but faced numerous obstacles from the Environment Agency. Armstrong Evans has been advising on several potential schemes at watermill sites and said it would now be almost impossible for them to go ahead because of the new charges, including his own scheme. Application charges for a small hydropower scheme and water source heat pump at a typical mill would be more than £19,000, he said “This consigns working watermills to history as there is no way that mill owners can meet the cost or negotiate the bureaucracy involved,” he said. “The opportunity to repurpose mills to generate domestic green electricity will be lost, along with the weirs and millstreams that have been a feature of the British landscape since before the Norman Conquest.” Members of at the Wyre Mill Club, a social and boating club at a former watermill on the River Avon near Pershore in Worcestershire, hoped to harness the power in the culverts under the mills for a hydropower scheme, but consider the new application fees are disproportionate. David Stanford, chair of the Wyre Mill Club committee, said: “This actually makes it unfeasible. We are answerable to members on how we spend their money and it’s ludicrous to pay £15,000 just for the application fees. We hope the government will change its mind on this.” There are about 1,560 hydropower schemes in the UK. The minimum cost of a scheme is about £35,000, and the government says in its impact assessment that the increased fees may be a “disincentive” for small hydropower schemes but there had only been a small number of applications in recent years. The agency said its staff costs for applications for water abstraction are about £100 an hour,, and it wants to increase the charges to reflect the costs. It says the new charging framework is to protect the environment and England’s long-term water supply. Simon Hamlyn, chief executive of the British Hydropower Association (BHA), said: “The concept of hundreds of old mills being restored to pristine condition is an attractive proposition, but the Environment Agency has put the final nail in the coffin of new hydropower in England.” Nuclear Free Local Authorities (NFLA), a group of councils campaigning for renewable energy, has written to the environment minster Rebecca Pow, asking for small hydropower schemes to be exempted from the charges. David Blackburn, NFLA chair, said: “This increase is outrageous and illogical.” An Environmental Agency spokesperson said: “We support sustainable growth and the contribution made by renewables but this must be done in a way that continues to safeguard the environment. The change to [hydroelectric power] application charges reflects the fact that determining a licence is complex and takes time due to considerable and wide-ranging risks to the environment.”",News/Environment,Is this the end for the traditional British watermill?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/30/is-this-the-end-for-the-traditional-british-watermill
5/1/2022,"During the first week of April each year, regular as clockwork, I get a very welcome phone call. When I answer, the voice at the other end simply says: “It’s Andrew. They’re back!” That’s the moment I know our local swallows have returned, having survived their epic 6,000-mile journey from South Africa to Somerset. Andrew Ratcliffe and his brother Duncan run a car repair workshop in a village down the road from me. Here, for almost four decades, swallows have made their nests on the crossbeams beneath the roof. All day long, they fly in and out, bringing back beakfuls of insects for their hungry chicks, seemingly oblivious to the constant noise and the comings and goings of customers. But this spring, the swallows didn’t arrive back at the workshop until 10 April – the latest they have ever returned in nearly 40 years. Numbers are down, too. At the turn of the millennium, at least 20 pairs nested here; nowadays, there are just five. Swallows were late back to my village, too. In the 16 springs we have lived here, the average return date has been 8 April – but this year I didn’t see one over my garden until the 25th. How different from that gloriously fine lockdown spring of 2020, when the first swallow appeared a full three weeks earlier than this year. At Portland Bird Observatory in Dorset, where many of our swallows make their first landfall in the UK, Martin Cade, a warden, confirms that this has been a very slow year for spring migrants. “The first half of April was rubbish,” he tells me. “There were virtually no birds – and a lot of very grumpy birders.” Some may have been passing overhead thanks to fine weather, but nevertheless numbers of birds were far lower than usual. The good news is that, from last weekend onwards, the tide appears to have turned. The observatory logged roughly 10,000 swallows, and other long-distance migrants such as sand martins and willow warblers also passed through in good numbers. However, other familiar species, such as the house martin, have been very few and far between, continuing the declining trend of the past few decades. Cade estimates that, this year, the main arrival of migrants has been roughly 10 days later than usual, peaking in late April, rather than the middle of the month. The latest nationwide figures from BirdTrack, organised by the British Trust for Ornithology, confirm this, showing that swallows, sand martins and house martins are all arriving between one and two weeks later than expected this spring. In the Scottish Highlands, house martins usually arrive by mid-April, with swallows a week or so afterwards. But the conservationist and nature writer Sir John Lister-Kaye tells me that, this spring, neither have yet returned to their breeding sites; although wood and willow warblers – which also come here from sub-Saharan Africa – have returned more or less on time. There are two reasons for the lateness of the swallows and martins. Unlike many other migrants, which fatten themselves up before they depart, these species feed as they travel, replenishing lost energy by catching flying insects. For that reason, they are especially vulnerable to bad weather en route. And the weather in southern Europe this spring – notably in southern Spain, which these birds cross after leaving Africa – has been very unsettled, with heavy rainfall, strong winds and even falls of snow across parts of Andalucía. The second reason is that, here in Britain, although the weather has been mainly dry, there have been persistent easterly and north-easterly winds, which also slow down the birds’ progress as they head north. How might this affect these global travellers in the longer term? Songbird migrants usually live for only one or two years, so they need to get down to raising a family as soon as they return. This means that delays of even a week or two can lower their chances of breeding successfully. Swallows, which usually start nesting in early April, may only be able to raise a single brood this year, rather than two (or even three), as they do in most years. I have seen swallows all over the world, and discovered just how important they are as a sign of spring: not just in Britain but right the way across the northern hemisphere. Since Aristotle noted that “one swallow does not a summer make” – a sentiment echoed by Shakespeare and many others – millions of us have celebrated their annual return as the true sign of spring. Yet I am concerned that rapid changes in the world’s climate – including more frequent and extreme weather events – pose a real threat to these birds’ long-term future. Disturbingly, this year some swallows even attempted to overwinter in Cornwall, suggesting that the climate crisis is already having a major impact on their behaviour. Fortunately, warm weather and clear skies have finally come to southern Europe, and the migration floodgates have opened. Earlier this week, down on the Somerset coast, I saw a steady passage of swallows, together with a few sand and house martins, all heading steadily northwards. Some will breed nearby, others elsewhere in the UK, while a few might even venture beyond the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia. If we enjoy a fine late spring and summer, with warm sunshine and enough rain to produce a glut of insects, the swallows might be able to make up for lost time. Then, as the autumn winds begin to blow, and flying insects become increasingly scarce, they will head off once again, on their incredible global journey to the southern tip of Africa.

5/1/2022,"In July 2021, specialist police officers in Manchester swooped on an international cryptocurrency scam, seizing USB sticks and an online safe containing £16m worth of digital coins, mostly ethereum. A month earlier, Leicestershire police had confiscated 10 types of cryptocurrency after raiding the home of a drug dealer who used digital assets to buy and sell class A drugs. Both operations pale in comparison to the Metropolitan police’s record crypto haul of the same year, worth £180m. But all three, and many more besides, are part of a spreading crypto-crimewave laid bare today by a series of freedom of information requests. The Observer requested data from the 45 regional police services in the UK asking for a breakdown of cryptocurrency seizures since 2017. The information sent back by the 27 forces that responded reveals a big shift: there has been a significant increase in the number of raids, and a proliferation in the types of digital coin criminals are using to invest the proceeds of their activities. More than half of the forces that responded seized crypto-assets during 2021, confiscating or restricting access to 22 different types of digital currency. This was a significant increase on 2020, when four types of crypto were seized, by eight police services. The figure was even lower in 2019, when only two types of digital currency were seized. While the best-known digital currencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, featured more than any others, the figures reveal the increasing popularity among convicted and suspected criminals of much less well known rivals. “Bitcoin is still key: it’s digital gold,” says Gurvais Grigg, who spent 23 years with the FBI and now works as chief technology officer for the data consultancy Chainalysis, which helps private companies and law enforcement bodies trace the movement of cryptocurrencies. “You’ve seen this emergence of ethereum, ‘stablecoins’ [cryptocurrencies pinned to a real-world asset] and a much more diverse market. As a result you’re going to find more of those currencies in the pockets of criminals, because they’re taking them from people.” In the Leicestershire case, police emerged with assets including Enjin Coin, Polkadot, Neo and even Chiliz, the crypto-tokens sold to football fans to enable them to access perks and vote on decisions at their clubs. In Wales, the South Wales Regional Organised Crime Unit seized eight crypto-assets, including one called Cake, while its counterpart in the south-west confiscated seven, including the Luxury Coin. “It’s an emerging field that’s come at us like a tidal wave, and policing has to adapt with the times,” says Phil Ariss, who coordinates the national police response to crypto-crime. “It’s a big learning curve, but we’re doing well.” He says 300 police officers have been trained in crypto, with hundreds more due to receive instruction. But the scope of the challenge is even greater than outlined by the Observer’s freedom of information requests. While some services haven’t made seizures themselves, “most are involved in investigations”, he says, with officers working on cases featuring between 35 and 40 types of coin. “It’s not just investments and theft, in some extreme cases it’s terrorism financing. It can be purchasing of child abuse images, money laundering. We’re seeing a huge span of cases across law enforcement,” he says. Most police services don’t disclose the amount of cryptocurrency involved, for fear that other bad actors, armed with such granular detail, could spot when seizures had taken place. Leicestershire police said it might give them “forewarning” of an investigation that could affect them, allowing them to take steps to hide ill-gotten gains. However, Dyfed-Powys police, which patrols a mostly rural area in which Llanelli is the largest town, told the Observer it had taken possession of 82 bitcoins in 2021, with a value of £2.5m at the most recent price. When the police do confiscate such digital assets, they are not well equipped to store them themselves. Instead, Avon and Somerset police explains, they contract that job out, storing the bounty “in a secure wallet with a third party provider”. They decline to name the companies involved, citing security reasons; there is a danger of workers at crypto-exchanges being targeted. In 2017, Pavel Lerner, a UK-based exchange employee, was abducted by gun-toting men wearing balaclavas in Ukraine. He was only released after a ransom was paid. Every police service that responded to the FoI requests referred to this case as a reason why they would not disclose holders of seized cryptocurrencies. “The above incident is not the only one of its kind,” Avon and Somerset police says. “As such, providing information to the wider public about the volume of assets stored and where they are stored increases the risk of cyber-attacks, insider threat and other hostile actions by those who may wish to infiltrate either the supplier or law enforcement.” In theory, the growing attraction of cryptocurrency to criminals is obvious. Large amounts of money can be sent across borders quickly, into jurisdictions that do not necessarily cooperate with UK law enforcement. According to Grigg, though, criminals should not get overconfident. Transactions that take place on the blockchain are, by their nature, logged. That means, with the right time and resources, they can be traced, and perpetrators apprehended, long after crimes have been committed. On the dark web, mixing services are available that allow criminals to launder their crypto, blending it with other types of assets to scatter the paper trail and throw investigators off their tail. But Grigg says that determined, well resourced investigators can still get there in the end. “Tracing tools have got better and data availability is better,” he says. The growing number of seizures in the UK is not just a reflection of more crime, he says, but of the growing ability of police officers to stop it. In addition, he points out, the legitimate crypto market has grown faster than the volume of crime-related transactions has. Illicit crypto addresses received $14bn during 2021, according to Chainalysis – a record sum, but an all-time low in terms of share of total volume, at just 0.15%. Yet as long as the crypto world is expanding rapidly, the challenge for law enforcement will grow alongside it. A separate freedom of information disclosure, shared with the Observer, reveals a significant increase in reports of crypto-related fraud last year. There were 9,607 such reports made to the national reporting hotline Action Fraud last year, according to the City of London police, up from 5,581 the year before and 3,558 in 2019. Victims, who were disproportionately likely to be under 35 and male, flagged financial losses of more than £200m. David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain, says more crypto equals more crime. “More people are using the stuff,” he says. “There are minor coins, known as ‘shitcoins’, for everything these days. “There will be a lot more scams because more people are promoting it. Times are tough, people are worried, so they’re prey to false hope and get-rich-quick schemes.” But Ariss points out that the greater the public’s interest in crypto, the greater also the awareness and understanding among the police officers trying to prevent ordinary people from becoming victims. “The [expansion] of crypto in the consciousness of the wider public also affects police officers. You only have to go on the tube and you see ads; crypto companies are sponsoring sports teams. On Crypto.com you’ve got Matt Damon endorsing it. “There’s an awareness that permeates, and in some ways the challenge [of training officers] is easier now than it ever has been.” Ariss says British police are keeping pace, so far. “We’re in a good place compared to some partners in international law enforcement. “The wheels of justice turn slowly so some of those good news stories haven’t come out yet, but time will show we’re doing a very good job.”",News/Technology,Crypto-crimewave forces police online to pursue ill-gotten assets,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/30/crypto-crimewave-forces-police-online-to-pursue-ill-gotten-assets
5/1/2022,"He’s the unflappable frontman and loyal defender of the errant “big dog” in Downing Street. Through the lens of Conservative politics, the transport secretary Grant Shapps is on a winning streak. But as crisis looms in a key part of his day job – running the railways – a series of bizarre interventions have raised eyebrows and hackles. Just what, the industry is wondering, is going on with Shapps and the Department for Transport? Rumbling disquiet has erupted into outright condemnation in some quarters, at a time when the biggest rail union, the RMT, has launched a national strike ballot, against a backdrop of lost revenue, deep cuts and an uncertain future. While the pace of promised reform and investment has been slow, Shapps has promoted personal wheezes that parts of the railway industry believe are, at best, misguided, and smack of YouTubing while Rome burns. Allies of Shapps say the videos, shot at speed on a minimal budget, reach fresh audiences – and a minister hamming it up has proved relatively viral. Employing the acting talents from his past life as Michael Green, when he had a job as a get-rich-quick marketeer, Shapps has rattled off films vowing to end “irritating” train announcements, announced a public vote to choose where to site the railway’s head office, and rebranded a minor ticketing promotion as the Great British Rail Sale. Another Shapps production – explaining moves to tackle noisy cars – was expected to drop this weekend. Few railway figures have openly aired discontent, but others off the payroll have come out blazing. In a blistering editorial, Nigel Harris, the boss of industry publication Rail, described Shapps, a keen pilot, as the least-engaged secretary of state he had come across in 25 years, accusing him of “not merely a shameful lack of leadership but also a shameful lack of interest”. On speaking to the Department for Transport, Harris was told the transport secretary “doesn’t do railways”. Even typically supportive organisations such as the Railway Industry Association (RIA) have issued despairing statements. In April the RIA marked 900 days since the government updated its pipeline of rail engineering works, “leaving the industry in the dark”. Under Shapps’s predecessor Chris Grayling, the DfT’s annual update was crucial for rail suppliers to plan ahead. For some, the lack of engagement is not necessarily an evil. A senior rail figure says: “Grayling would have constantly interfered in rail … the danger with Shapps is that he doesn’t, until there’s a bit of political advantage or a TikTok video.” Christian Wolmar, the rail historian and writer, says: “He’s one of the government’s most effective communicators. But he has zero interest in transport other than general aviation, and where he can fly a plane to. The person who runs transport is called A Gilligan and is in No 10.” This portrayal of the relative influence of Andrew Gilligan, Boris Johnson’s transport adviser, is disputed by government insiders, though No 10’s interest in rail investment as a way to “level up” has kept the DfT on a tighter leash than some departments. As a well-placed rail source puts it, Shapps is “stuck between a rock and a hard place … any major announcement has to go by Gilligan at No 10 for review and alteration, and the Treasury holds all the purse strings”. Scrutiny is intense, with major state subsidy – £15bn extra since the start of the pandemic, to replace lost revenues from passenger numbers that remain stubbornly below pre-pandemic levels – and battles over investment squeezing the DfT between No 10 and No 11 in key decisions on HS2 and the integrated rail plan. As one industry leader puts it: “The government is more involved than it ever was, even under British Rail.” State micromanagement was, ironically, identified as a problem in the Williams review of the old franchising system, which was abolished by economic necessity under Shapps in 2020. But as the industry awaits reforms in the long-delayed Williams-Shapps plan, the urge to interfere on the little things is yet to be suppressed. The Great British Rail Sale was spun up in Shapps’s office and is understood to have come as a surprise to some, not least the nascent Great British Railways. Even within the DfT, senior officials expressed shock at the final presentation: “It was mind-boggling. What were they thinking of?” Officials complain about Shapps’s lack of attention to detail and unwillingness to be briefed by experts outside his inner circle. “He doesn’t have meetings with people, he just sees his immediate team. Everything has to be written on two sides of paper for him.” Shapps’s allies confirm he will politely reject longer briefing notes – but argue that concision is crucial to run a wide-ranging department, where all sectors have been plunged into crisis during Covid. “He takes home a red box every night and reads everything,” one said. Rail remains, sources insist, the heart of his ministry – and takes up a disproportionate amount of time compared with cars and even buses. Shapps said he wanted the transport job, and as a rail commuter he understands the passenger viewpoint, they argue. One said: “Give the man a bloody chance … he’s got a £96bn settlement for rail, and he’s trying to remodel the rail industry” via the Williams-Shapps plan. For Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, “the acid test is whether they keep the investment coming … and this secretary of state has.” Nonetheless, the perception remains widespread that Shapps is self-promoting, Liz Truss-style, for a cabinet post more to his interest. “All this stuff would be OK if he was paying attention to everything else. There are so many major issues he’s ignoring,” says Harris. The videos are trivial but also damaging, he argues: the head office vote, potentially uprooting thousands of people from Milton Keynes on a public whim, could haemorrhage vital staff: “When you move, you bleed.” The Rail editor is clear: “He’s the worst transport secretary I can remember. And yet he’s actually a very good communicator – and could be doing a lot of good.”",News/Business,Grant Shapps under fire for bizarre videos and ‘zero interest’ in railways,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/30/grant-shapps-under-fire-for-bizarre-videos-and-zero-interest-in-railways
5/1/2022,"In the early 1930s, when Claud Cockburn worked on the Times, the subeditors had a competition to see who could compose the dullest headline. Cockburn claimed that he won with “Small earthquake in Chile. Not many dead”. Alas, subsequent factcheckers have failed to unearth such a headline in the archives, but it came to mind last week when Netflix announced, in a quarterly earnings report, that for the first time in a decade it had lost subscribers – 200,000 of them, to be exact. In North America, it had lost 640,000 and suffered additional losses in every other region except for Asia-Pacific area, where it added a million. This didn’t seem very interesting to this columnist, especially as it included the period when Netflix had pulled out of Russia, where it had 700,000 subscribers, which to my mind meant that the reported loss would have been a gain of half a million had Putin not invaded Ukraine. Still, the negative 200,000 figure seemed to spook Wall Street. Netflix’s stock price collapsed by nearly 40% in two days, taking more than $50bn off the company’s market value in the blink of an eye. This was a shock because just over a month ago – on 8 March, to be precise – the company’s chief financial officer was telling a conference organised by Morgan Stanley that the company was on a growth track that “pretty quickly gets us to a business that’s over a half a billion members”. But now suddenly that rosy picture has faded; the outlook has turned pessimistic and Netflix is forecasting that it will lose another 2 million subscribers over the next three months. So what happened? Why has a golden goose suddenly turned into a turkey? Possible explanations include the thought that maybe Netflix’s precipitous growth was a blip caused by the pandemic lockdown. In that case, it’s rather like, say, Zoom or Peloton, other erstwhile beneficiaries of Covid. Another plausible hypothesis is that it’s driven by consumer reaction to the new post-Covid reality of raging inflation and an impending cost-of-living crisis. This is supported by the discovery that it’s not just Netflix that’s affected; other streaming services are too. In the UK, for example, the number of subscribers to streaming video services such as Amazon Prime and Disney+ – as well as Netflix – fell in the first quarter of the year. According to one report, the number of UK homes with at least one paid-for subscription to a streaming service fell by 215,000 in the first three months, ending a decade of almost uninterrupted growth in the popularity of such services. And as households pull back on their addiction to binge-watching opportunities, there’s a gloomy feeling in the industry that they will fall back on the devils they know – Netflix and Amazon Prime – rather than the newcomers Disney+ and Apple. The recent proliferation of video streaming services was celebrated by salivating media evangelists, who saw it as a wondrous proliferation of consumer choice. Sadly, most of these enthusiasts seem never to have read any history. In particular, they have clearly never heard of Herbert Simon, a brilliant economist who won a Nobel prize in 1978 and who presciently observed in 1971 that “in an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.” Let’s do some sums. Of the 24 hours in the day, we spend about eight of them sleeping, eight working and two or three doing other things such as cooking, shopping etc. That leaves something like five hours that are available for other activities – exercise, email, social media, web browsing, video games, reading, hobbies, going to the cinema, shouting at the TV news and so on. Those five hours, which also define the zone where the world’s couch-potatoes hang out, are what the operators of streaming services are aiming to colonise. The downturn in streaming services may be a signal that this is a tighter marketplace than tech entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and media companies fondly imagine. Which on the whole would represent a benefit for humanity. Evolution didn’t design human bodies for slumping on settees and being a couch potato doesn’t do much for one’s mental health. And less streaming might also be good for the planet. A Carbon Trust study estimated in 2020 that the carbon emissions from one hour of online video were 56g of CO2 per device. Multiply that by the 200,000 subscribers that Netflix has lost and you get an idea of what the environmental benefit of less streaming might be. In every cloud, there’s a silver lining.

5/1/2022,"Born in New York to Haitian parents and now based in New Orleans, Leyla McCalla has explored her ancestral roots on previous solo albums. The result of a commission from Duke University in North Carolina, this fourth venture takes her deeper into the history of the Caribbean republic and that of Radio Haiti, the station that for decades confronted the corruption and brutality of regimes that arrested and tortured journalists and eventually murdered its founder. It was almost the only station that broadcast in the local creole language rather than French. McCalla delivers the story – which has also become a theatrical piece – with a mixture of original and traditional songs, dropping in the odd radio clip for effect. The pieces are mostly sung in creole, though there are English-language pieces such as Caetano Veloso’s Brazilian song of exile You Don’t Know Me. McCalla’s vocal style remains relaxed, but set against simple backings that ally her cello and banjo playing with sophisticated percussion, she conjures moods of abjection (Fort Dimanche concerns a notorious prison), protest (“We are the ones who bake the bread and get burnt at the oven,” complains Dodinin) and longing (Boukman’s Prayer).

5/1/2022,"For weeks Hilton Acioli wrestled with the melodies and lyrics that would become the theme tune to one of the most remarkable political careers in recent history. Finally, one morning in the winter of 1989, something clicked. “Lula lá – a star is sparkling. Lula lá – the flourishing of hope,” the Cat Stevens-loving Brazilian songsmith sang as he sat before his computer with a guitar. The subject of Acioli’s ditty was Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a shoeshine boy turned union leader who was preparing to launch a once-unimaginable bid to become Brazil’s first working-class president. “I felt so excited,” Acioli said of the moment he composed the unforgettable jingle for Lula’s first presidential run. “I called everyone on the campaign and told them: ‘I think I’ve nailed it.’” Lula’s debut campaign ended in failure but Acioli’s song, Sem Medo de Ser Feliz [Unafraid of Being Happy], became an enduring hit, providing the soundtrack as the bearded leftist continued his quest for power over the coming years. Lula lost two more elections, in 1994 and 1998, before finally triumphing in 2002 – a watershed moment for Latin America’s largest democracy that ushered in almost a decade of historic social inclusion and poverty reduction. Many thought Lula’s extraordinary poverty-to-power tale was over when he stepped down in 2010 with sky-high approval ratings and having been declared “the most popular politician on Earth” by Barack Obama. When Lula was jailed for alleged corruption and barred from the 2018 election his political future looked in shreds. But allies say the chaos unleashed by the man who won that year’s election, the far-right radical Jair Bolsonaro, and Lula’s unexpected political rehabilitation last year, persuaded the veteran leftist to postpone retirement and return to the fray. “There’s just no way he would flee from this mission,” said Fátima Bezerra, a leading figure in Lula’s Worker’s party (PT) who has known him since its foundation in the 1980s. “He understands perfectly the danger we are facing,” Bezerra said of the incessant authoritarian outbursts from Brazil’s dictatorship-admiring president. “What’s at risk right now is democracy itself.” On 7 May Lula, now 76, will formally announce his sixth bid for the presidency, at an event in São Paulo. Acioli’s anthem is again on the playlist as a new generation of leftwingers look to bring the curtains down on Bolsonaro’s ultra-conservative era. “They’re going to have to swallow the fact that Lula will be our country’s next president,” said Nanda Matinny, a 24-year-old actor, after dancing to a remixed version of Acioli’s jingle at a pro-Lula rally near Rio. Matinny, who was five when Lula first took power in 2003, said the song made her feel nostalgia for a past she was too young to have known. “I want to live through what I didn’t live through before. I need to,” she said. “We need this man to be elected to reconstruct Brazil.” Tens of millions of Brazilians seem to agree, with polls giving Lula a substantial advantage over Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper who many blame for catastrophically botching Brazil’s response to a Covid outbreak that has killed more than 660,000 people, as well as undermining democracy and devastating the environment. Felipe Nunes, the head of the pollster Quaest, said Lula’s lead did not mean he was seen as an “untainted character” or that voters had forgotten the major corruption scandals that marred his administration and that of his successor, Dilma Rousseff. But, unlike the incumbent, Lula was considered a dependable political expert who could bring stability. “People are looking for someone who can sort out the economy. People are looking for the hope of having a decent quality of life once again,” said Nunes. Many progressive Brazilians worry about the lack of generational renewal at the top of Lula’s party, whose key figures are mostly now in their 60s or 70s. Lula will be 81 at the end of his term if elected. But the former president remains by far Brazil’s best-known leftwing politician and – with no immediate heir in sight – the one best placed to defeat Bolsonaro. During an interview at his home in Natal, the seaside capital of the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte, Acioli expressed optimism Lula would be able to end four years of Bolsonarian misery in October’s election. “Everything suggests he’s going to win,” the 82-year-old composer enthused. Bezerra, Rio Grande do Norte’s governor, said she was “immensely hopeful” her friend would lead Brazil out of “authoritarian and obscurantist nightmare”. “I’ve seen him and he’s full of energy and raring to go,” said Bezerra, 66, flanked by a red Lula banner stamped with the words: “Brazil Happy Again”. Yet recent weeks have suggested Lula’s mission may be tougher than some progressives had hoped. With public anger over Brazil’s Covid disaster apparently fading as normality returns, some polls have shown Bolsonaro gaining ground. Around the corner from Natália Bonavides’s headquarters in Natal, a graffiti artist has painted a pun on the president’s name: “Acabou-sonaro” (Bolson-over). But Bonavides, the PT’s youngest member of congress, urged the president’s opponents not to underestimate him. “Even after all the tragedies that have been caused over the last three years, Bolsonaro remains an extremely strong candidate,” the 33-year-old insisted. Bonavides, who is one of the leading lights of Brazil’s new left, said part of the danger was Bolsonaro’s ability to use the state machine and federal funds to buy political support and win over voters. She also worried about the dissemination of fake news, whether Bolsonaro would accept the election result, and the poisonous political atmosphere that has gripped Brazil under its pro-gun president. In recent weeks the Donald Trump-admiring populist has billed the 2022 election as an epic war between God-fearing “good” and communist “evil” leading some to fear violence. Bonavides feels the toxic mood more than most. Last year a rightwing television pundit who is close to Bolsonaro publicly declared that people like her needed eliminating with machine guns and urged her to stick to washing her husband’s pants. A picture of Marielle Franco, the leftist Rio politician who was assassinated in 2018, hangs outside Bonavides’s office – a reminder of the dangers of doing politics in 21st-century Brazil. But the young congresswoman vowed to persist. “I can’t say I’m not afraid … but it’s crucial we don’t allow these things to paralyse us.” Bonavides believed one of the keys to beating Bolsonaro was engaging with the urban poor who were worst hit by the economic fallout from Covid. On a recent evening she drove north to an abandoned railway depot that had been occupied by dozens of impoverished families Bonavides said had been plunged further into destitution by Bolsonaro’s social policies, rising unemployment and inflation. “Every day new families are arriving. It’s frightening,” said one of the occupation’s leaders, Matheus Araújo, as families used mud-caked sheets of plastic and planks of rotting wood to build shacks in the dank warehouse around him. Outside, Bonavides pledged to help the squatters fight eviction and urged them to make the link between their plight and the policies of Brazil’s current leader. “The Bolsonaros of this world have never done anything to grant people their rights – and they never will. Because rights aren’t granted – they are seized,” she shouted through a loudhailer, as an activist clutched a red flag emblazoned with the words: “Fora Bolsonaro!” (Bolsonaro Out!). For all his excitement over Lula’s comeback, the composer Acioli also sounded a note of caution, comparing the coming months to a political minefield. “Many pitfalls lie ahead,” the musician warned. “Even now, there are so many lies that people still believe.” Despite the scale of Brazil’s coronavirus calamity and the corruption scandals that have blighted Bolsonaro’s administration and relatives, the president has retained the unwavering support of about 25% of voters. Hardcore followers remain convinced their leader is spearheading a righteous conservative crusade to stop Brazil becoming a communist dictatorship under Lula. Thomas Traumann, a political commentator and former communications minister under the PT, said it was wishful thinking to imagine Bolsonaro stood no chance. “Lula is the favourite. It’s 70-30. But that doesn’t mean 70 always wins,” Traumann warned, urging Lula’s campaign not to underestimate the depth of anti-PT feeling and the association many still made between the party and economic crisis and corruption. Helio Oliveira, an air force reservist and pro-Bolsonaro activist in Natal, said he would consider leaving Brazil or moving to a remote part of the countryside if Lula won: “He’s a bad character who lacks values.” As he pondered the coming showdown, Acioli sat down on his veranda and began to perform the song he had written to launch Lula’s first campaign more than three decades ago. “Unafraid to be happy! Unafraid to be happy! Unafraid to be happy!” he sang as he strummed his guitar. “It’s unfortunate to talk about a saviour of the nation but that’s kind of what it is. There is no one else,” Acioli said. Bonavides was a baby when Acioli wrote his most famous ballad but, like millions of Brazilians, knows its lyrics by heart. She said it reminded her of how close Lula came to succeeding in his first presidential bid, and how close to reclaiming power he is now. “It’s song that brings me great hope,” she said, a portrait of her party’s leader hanging on the wall behind her. “Bolsonaro represents the cesspool of politics and Lula represents hope,” Bonavides said. “Lula – as [Salvador] Allende would say – represents the great avenues down which free women and men will pass.”",News/World news,Is Brazil ready for the next incarnation of President Lula?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/30/is-brazil-ready-for-the-next-incarnation-of-president-lula
5/1/2022,"Mino Raiola, the agent of players including Paul Pogba and Erling Haaland, has died aged 54 after living with a serious illness since January. Dr Alberto Zangrillo, from San Raffaele hospital in Milan, told the news agency Ansa on Thursday that Raiola was “fighting to survive”. He spoke after multiple reports that Raiola had died, which prompted a post from his official Twitter account to state that he was still alive. However, on Saturday afternoon, a family statement on the account confirmed Raiola’s death, although no timeline or cause of death was given. “In infinite sorrow we share the passing of the most caring and amazing football agent there ever was,” it read. “Mino fought until the end with the same strength he put on negotiation tables to defend our players. As usual, Mino made us proud and never realised it. “Mino touched so many lives through his work and wrote a new chapter in the history of modern football. His presence will forever be missed. Mino’s mission of making football a better place for players will continue with the same passion.” The Italy-born Dutch national was one of football’s most powerful and high-earning agents after almost three decades in the job. His other clients have included Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Matthijs de Ligt and Mario Balotelli. Pogba and Haaland are expected to make two of this summer’s most significant transfers, with Pogba available on a free when his contract at Manchester United ends and Haaland poised to leave Borussia Dortmund. Manchester City intend to sign the Norway striker. Raiola, who spoke Italian, Dutch, English, French, German, Spanish and Portuguese, was born in Italy but moved to the Dutch city of Haarlem with his family as a baby and worked there in the family pizzeria as a boy. Terrible news. Football agent Mino Raiola has passed away after illness, he’s been sick for months, he was 54.Raiola was the agent of many football stars like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Paul Pogba, Erling Haaland, Pavel Nedved and many others.🙏🏻🕊 Raiola later looked after the restaurant’s books, studied law and became a director at the local football club. He wanted to be a football agent, though, and his break came when he was asked by Rob Jansen, one of the leading agents in the Netherlands, to help as an interpreter on Dennis Bergkamp’s transfer from Ajax to Internazionale in 1993. Raiola was given a job at Jansen’s company but walked out to set up on his own. He oversaw Pogba’s then world-record £93.2m transfer to United from Juventus in 2016. His outspoken nature was exemplified in 2020 when he criticised United’s then manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, for his treatment of Pogba. Raiola said he regarded Pogba not as a client but as family. Raiola earlier fell out with Sir Alex Ferguson and said in an interview for one of Ibrahimovic’s autobiographies that he found a kindred spirit in the Swede: “I realised straight away that he was an arrogant bastard – in other words, just like me.” Raiola was fiercely critical of Fifa proposals to cap the money agents could make from transfers.",Sport/Football,"Mino Raiola, one of football’s most powerful agents, dies aged 54",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/30/mino-raiola-one-of-footballs-most-powerful-agents-dies-aged-54
