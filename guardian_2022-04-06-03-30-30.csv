4/6/2022,"According to one key individual involved in the battle for Channel 4’s future, the broadcaster is a “wonderful company doing a fantastic job”, it is performing well financially and plays a crucial role in supporting the British television ecosystem. Curiously, that individual is Stephen Parkinson, a government minister arguing that the only solution to secure Channel 4’s future is to rapidly privatise it and sell it off to a commercial owner, possibly one based overseas. One of the more confusing aspects of the decision to push ahead with the privatisation of Channel 4 is trying to understand the motive. Multiple governments have considered and then rejected the idea over the last three decades. The latest attempt was a pet project of the former culture minister John Whittingdale, and was seen as having taken a hit when he lost his job in last autumn’s reshuffle. A public consultation was launched last summer and its 60,000 responses – still unpublished but assumed to be largely anti-privatisation – led to rumblings among civil servants that ministers would ultimately drop the plans rather than face a bruising parliamentary battle. Which leaves onlookers asking the question: why does the government care so much about privatising Channel 4? One explanation – offered by the Conservative MP Julian Knight, the chair of the House of Commons culture select committee – is that the proposal is revenge for supposed anti-Tory and anti-Brexit bias in its output over recent years. “Undoubtedly, across much of the party there is a feeling of payback time and the word privatisation tickles the ivories of many,” Knight said. Yet while Conservative MPs complain regularly about the BBC, their comments about Channel 4 are less frequent. They may not like its output but because Channel 4 does not rely on a licence fee enforced by threat of criminal prosecution, it escapes much of the criticism levelled at the BBC. Indeed, large chunks of the public are unaware that Channel 4 is owned by the government, since – like the profit-seeking ITV and Channel 5 – it shows adverts and is run on a commercial basis. The other stated reason is that ministers and officials have concluded that while Channel 4 is currently a success, its continued reliance on revenue from traditional television broadcasts means it is ultimately doomed without a deep-pocketed backer. That’s despite Channel 4’s bosses, the independent television production companies who make its shows, and a significant number of Tory politicians all insisting that the channel is financially sustainable. Even Sir David Attenborough popped up to express his concerns that the government is undermining public service broadcasting. The required legislation now faces a rocky journey through parliament, with much opposition from the Conservative benches, at a time when there is a general election on the horizon, when governments usually want to focus on their core messages. One little understood aspect of Channel 4 is that it is barred from making its own programmes and must commission everything from external television companies based across the UK. As part of the privatisation process, the government wants to relax these rules and allow Channel 4 to start making programmes in-house, and then use the proceeds of the £1bn sale to fund unspecified skills training projects as part of its levelling up agenda. This would lead to the odd situation of a Conservative government taking private-sector contracts away from small businesses and then trying to make up the difference with grants. In a canny piece of political positioning, the television industry trade body Pact has sought to win over Conservative MPs by portraying Channel 4 – founded by a Tory government in 1982 – as a Thatcherite success story. John McVay, the organisation’s chief executive, said: “Selling it off now risks reducing the opportunities for independent producers and reducing the amount of programming commissioned outside London – levelling down, not levelling up.”",News/Media,Tory ’revenge’ against Channel 4 could turn into bruising battle,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/05/tory-revenge-against-channel-4-could-turn-into-bruising-battle
4/6/2022,"Nadine Dorries strikes again. It is impossible to take her seriously as a politician of substance, but she seems determined to do – and capable of doing – serious damage. She has restated her intention to push ahead with selling off Channel 4, in order, she says, to allow it to compete with Netflix and Amazon, from which destiny it is currently being “held back”. This makes no sense, and shows a lack of understanding of what these streamers are and what they do (giant US tech companies aiming for global reach); and of what Channel 4 is and does (a British public-service broadcaster that publishes, rather than owns, the material it commissions, and is aimed at generating a diverse, lively domestic production sector). Why anyone would feel the need to transform Channel 4’s ownership arrangements is a mystery. A Tory government rejected the notion in 2016. Indeed, senior Conservatives, including the former culture secretary Jeremy Hunt and Ruth Davidson, the former leader of the Scottish Tories, have publicly condemned the idea since the culture secretary’s latest pronouncement on the matter. What many Tories grasp, but Ms Dorries seems not to, is that Channel 4, though in public ownership, costs the taxpayer nothing, since it raises its own cash and then, crucially, ploughs its revenues back into commissioning. In November she asserted to a parliamentary select committee that the channel is funded by the taxpayer. This is quite simply untrue (indeed, she was immediately corrected by her questioner, fellow Tory Damian Green). It is concerning that the fate of a national broadcaster depends, at least in part, on someone who seems to know so little about it. As to the potential proceeds of this sale, Ms Dorries airily claims that they will be spent on “levelling up the creative sector [and] putting money into independent production and creative skills in priority parts of the country”. The same objective could be achieved much more efficiently by letting Channel 4 remain in public ownership, and continuing to commission material from programme-makers based around the UK. In fact, following its recent move to Leeds, two-thirds of its programming hours are now produced outside London. Even if the government were to lay down conditions with a buyer, it is likely that commitments to regional commissioning, as well as a long-established responsibility to serve diverse and minority audiences, would slip. It should be acknowledged that Channel 4 is far from perfect. It is not quite the bastion of the avant garde that folk memory of the 1980s often suggests. It can do more to fulfil its founding ambitions. Nevertheless, there are wonderful bright spots – shows such as Russell T Davies’ It’s A Sin, about young British gay men at the start of the Aids crisis, and the comedy We Are Lady Parts, about a Muslim women’s post-punk band – which have been recognised with multiple Bafta nominations. It is also fair to suggest that the current model of raising revenues from television advertising may not serve the broadcaster for ever. But a sale to a huge overseas player would probably mean the end of that granularly British work that it makes at its best. Consider, by way of contrast, the glossy, could-be-made-anywhere quality of the material on Netflix; however brilliant the streaming giant’s programmes are, it tends to polish them into a kind of globally acceptable sheen. Fortunately, Ms Dorries’ words are not the last on this matter. Channel 4’s privatisation would have to pass through the Commons and, crucially, the Lords. Wiser heads must prevail, and this nonsense – which is nakedly about politics rather than the real needs of a much-loved broadcaster – must be stopped in its tracks.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Channel 4: don’t sell it | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/05/the-guardian-view-on-channel-4-dont-sell-it
4/6/2022,"Facebook will restore a banned advert promoting an opinion piece calling for renters rights, after the company’s automated systems blocked the post for “discrimination”. But critics warn that the error will be repeated unless Facebook acts to protect campaigners on its platform. On Monday, Ronan Burtenshaw, the editor of Tribune Magazine, received a message from Facebook that one of his publication’s posts had been blocked from being promoted on the site. The story, headlined The Rent is Too Damn High, calls for “a struggle of renters against the rentiers”, and concludes that solving the housing crisis requires a massive program of council house creation. Burtenshaw found it had been banned from being shared as a promoted post because the “ad doesn’t comply with our policy on Discriminatory practices”. His first conclusion was that the company was trying to protect landlords from discrimination. Here’s a good one: Facebook has prevented us from promoting our article on record rents today because it’s “discriminatory” against… landlords.We appealed as well: no dice. Big Tech censorship is off the wall. pic.twitter.com/e9F4JIRYGC After Burtenshaw’s tweet went viral and the Guardian queried its removal, Facebook changed course, and restored the ad. “The ad placed by the Tribune was rejected in error by our systems but is now active and will appear in the ad library shortly,” a Facebook spokesperson said. “While our review is largely automated, we rely on our teams to build and train these systems, and in some cases, to manually review ads. Sometimes both machines and humans make mistakes and an ad may be rejected in error, but we endeavour to restore them as soon as possible.” But Tribune’s post isn’t the only call for better housing policy to be blocked from the social network. Others, including Labour councillor Martin Lennon, have experienced the same issue. His campaigns to build more council housing in Scotland were also blocked for discriminatory practices. The problem seems to lie with Facebook’s attempts to prevent discrimination in adverts for rentals. In 2019, the company was charged with violating the US Fair Housing Act, alleging that its targeted advertising allowed landlords to discriminate on the basis of race, colour, national origin, religion, familial status, sex and disability. As a result, Burtenshaw warns, Facebook has gone too far in the opposite direction. “Facebook’s policies have accidentally banned campaigning for tenant’s rights on Facebook. It seems like anything that’s targeted by age or region that’s related to housing is something that they’re flagging up – but the effect of it is that if we do a piece on tenant organising, that gets flagged, and can’t be advertised. “Given that Facebook’s whole algorithm is written to massively advantage people who put money into the system, it means you can’t get your message across.”",News/Technology,Facebook restores banned ad promoting renters rights after tweet goes viral,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/05/facebook-restores-banned-ad-promoting-renters-rights-after-tweet-goes-viral
4/6/2022,"Two days ago his audience consisted of Justin Bieber, Doja Cat, Dua Lipa, Lil Nas X, Olivia Rodrigo and Saweetie. This was Volodymyr Zelenskiy, president of Ukraine and man for all seasons, delivering a virtual message to the Grammy music awards in Las Vegas. A little incongruous? A bit off key? The same might have been said on Tuesday when Zelenskiy addressed the UN security council, led by its five permanent members: the United States, Britain, China, France – and Russia. Yes, the Ukrainian president found himself caught in the paradox of demanding that the security council secure itself. If anyone could pull it off, it may have been Zelenskiy, now an old hand at taking his message around the world via video link, addressing parliament after parliament and earning comparisons with Winston Churchill as a wartime communicator. “I’ve used up all my superlatives for Zelenskyy,” tweeted David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist who masterminded Barack Obama’s election victories. “An astonishing, courageous leader in the midst of unthinkable horror and evil. His words land with such force!” Zelenskiy’s success is thrown into sharp relief by the glum and glowering presence of the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, mostly silent as his army faces growing accusations of war crimes. The makeup of the security council meant that Putin’s man, bald and bespectacled Russian ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, got to speak first on Tuesday and complain it was “outrageous” that the council was not going to discuss “the horrific provocation of Ukrainian forces in Bucha”. This was quickly dismissed and, a few speakers later, all eyes at the C-shaped table turned to Zelenskiy on the giant screen. Once again he sat on a brown leather chair in a white-walled office, a Ukrainian flag to his right, wearing a beard and open-necked dark green shirt. At the Grammys the former actor and comedian had described the sound of silence in his country and the redemptive quality of music. At the UN, he was in full war leader mode, hammering home a message about the massacre of the innocents. Zelenskiy gave a vivid eyewitness account of what he had just seen in Bucha, a town near the capital, Kyiv. “They cut off limbs, slashed their throats, women were raped and killed in front of their children,” he said unsparingly. “Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear.” As Nebenzia looked on, Zelenskiy then highlighted the contradiction at the heart of the security council. “This is no different from other terrorists such as Daesh [Islamic State], who occupied some territories, and here it is done by a member of the United Nations security council.” He called for Nuremberg-style trials – but what hope for justice when Russia can veto any effort by the security council to prosecute Putin for war crimes? And what hope when Russia, Ukraine and, for that matter, the US, are not signatories to the international criminal court? Zelenskiy added an uncomfortable truth that the UN did not want to hear: “Where is the security that the security council needs to guarantee? It’s not there, although there is a security council. So where is the peace? Where are those guarantees that the United Nations needs to guarantee? “It is obvious that the key institution of the world which must ensure the coercion of any aggressor to peace simply cannot work effectively.” The implication was clear: a broken security council can only lead to a broken world. Zelenskiy suggested hosting a global conference in Kyiv to discuss fundamental reform of the UN. “It is now clear that the goals set in San Francisco in 1945, for the creation of a global security international organisation, have not been achieved,” Zelenskiy said. “And it is impossible to achieve them without reforms.” As has become familiar on his virtual world tour, Zelenskiy concluded by asking his audience to watch a video from the frontline. But this time there was a technical hiccup and it did not appear. Some TV viewers may have switched off and gone about their day. But minutes later the glitch was solved so Nebenzia and others present were compelled to watch it. Set to plangent music, the film depicted a tragedy too deep for tears, with scene after scene of dead bodies, children included. It was the small intimacies that stung: dropped keys next to a blackened hand, red nail varnish on limp fingers, a child’s abandoned pink shoe. Soon after, one diplomat compared what is happening to Pablo Picasso’s painting Guernica. Which brings to mind the story from Nazi-occupied Paris when a Gestapo officer is said to have asked Picasso about the painting: “Did you do that?” The artist replied: “No, you did.”",News/US news,‘Where is the security?’ Zelenskiy tells home truths to UN security council,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/05/volodymyr-zelenskiy-un-security-council-sketch
4/6/2022,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has given the UN security council a harrowing account of atrocities in his country and demanded that Russian leaders “be brought to justice for war crimes”. The Ukrainian president called for an international tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials of Nazis after the second world war. Speaking of Russian forces, he said: “There is not a single crime that they would not commit there.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he would “never forget the horrifying images of civilians killed” in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. Speaking at the UN security council in New York, he said the war in Ukraine is “one of the greatest challenges ever” to the “international order”. The UN undersecretary general for political and peacebuilding affairs, Rosemary DiCarlo, said allegations of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian forces include “gang-rape and rapes in front of children”. Displaced residents of Bucha should not yet return to their homes because there are still mines in the area after the Russian withdrawal from the devastated Ukrainian town, its mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said. Fedoruk said about 3,700 civilians had stayed in Bucha throughout the occupation by Russian troops. It had a prewar population of about 37,000. The UN human rights office spokesperson, Liz Throssell, said all the signs from the Ukrainian town of Bucha pointed towards civilians having been directly targeted and killed. She described the images emerging from the aftermath of Russia’s occupation of the town as “extremely disturbing”. Israel’s foreign minister, Yair Lapid, has strongly condemned Russia’s “war crimes” in Ukraine in a statement intensifying Israel’s criticism of Russia. Earlier, the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, condemned the killing of civilians in Bucha but stopped short of accusing Russian forces of responsibility. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the evidence from Bucha showed “a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities” by Russian forces. “The reports are more than credible. The evidence is there for the world to see,” he told reporters. Scores of Russian diplomats have been expelled from European countries this week in a direct expression of governments’ outrage at the killings of Ukrainian civilians revealed as Moscow’s military forces left. In what amounts to one of the biggest diplomatic breakdowns of recent years, 149 Russian diplomats have been told since Monday they were no longer welcome to stay by governments in Italy, France, Germany and elsewhere. The Kremlin said allegations that Russian forces committed war crimes by killing civilians in Bucha were a “monstrous forgery” aimed at “denigrating” the Russian army. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that remarks by the the US president, Joe Biden, on Monday calling for Vladimir Putin to be tried for war crimes were unacceptable and unworthy of a US leader. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced that the EU was proposing new sanctions against Russia, including an import ban on coal worth €4bn (£3.3bn) a year. The package will also include a full transaction ban on four key Russian banks, a ban on Russian vessels and Russian operated vessels from accessing EU ports, and targeted export and import bans. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Nato and G7 foreign ministers meeting on Wednesday and Thursday would discuss the delivery of advanced weapons to Ukraine. Ammunition, medical supplies and “high-end” weapons systems would also be discussed, he said. A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross has been released after being stopped during an attempt to reach the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol and held in nearby Manhush. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said there would be an attempt to open seven humanitarian corridors on Tuesday.

4/6/2022,"Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the UN security council after videos and photos showed streets in the town of Bucha strewn with corpses, some with their hands tied behind their back. He gave a harrowing account of atrocities, of civilians “shot and killed in the back of the head after being tortured” and “women were raped and killed in front of their children”, that he said were no different to the behaviour of the terrorist group Islamic State. He demanded that Russian leaders be “brought to justice for war crimes”. The bodies were discovered after Russian troops withdrew from positions around Kyiv as part of what appears to be a refocusing of Russia’s war effort in the south and east. The Kremlin has denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians in Bucha. Satellite imagery of one street from 19 and 21 March appears to show several bodies in exactly the same position as in video footage and photos taken this weekend in the same street. Warning: the following videos contain graphic images of dead bodies that some viewers may find distressing Zelenskiy warned that the deaths in Bucha may be just the tip of the iceberg, saying he had information that even more people had been killed in places like nearby Borodyanka. The Guardian spoke to a man who described three days and nights of torture, mock executions and the disappearance of fellow prisoners during his captivity by Russian forces in the town. In other developments, the Red Cross said that Russian forces had released a team sent to help evacuate residents from Mariupol that was detained en route on Monday, and Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists traded accusations over an acid tank explosion in Luhansk. In Mykolaiv, officials raised the death toll in the bombing of a bus stop and shopping area on Monday to 11. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
4/6/2022,"Ministers have paved the way for a reconsideration of the moratorium on fracking in England by commissioning a new study to examine safety concerns about the controversial practice. In an effort to decrease Britain’s reliance on imported energy given spiralling costs, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said it was “absolutely right that we explore all possible domestic energy sources”. The Conservatives promised in their 2019 manifesto they would not support shale gas extraction “unless the science shows categorically that it can be done safely”. A moratorium in England was placed on the process in November 2019 after protests, legal challenges and planning rejections. Some Tory MPs have pushed for fracking to be part of the government’s long-delayed energy security strategy, expected to be published on Thursday. But others have predicted it would lead to electoral oblivion in those parts of the country identified for new shale gas extraction, and would fail to bring down energy bills. Kwarteng said he would be “guided by the science” and emphasised it would take years before enough shale gas could be produced to make more wells commercially viable, with “no effect on prices in the near term”. He added: “In light of Putin’s criminal invasion of Ukraine, it is absolutely right that we explore all possible domestic energy sources. However, unless the latest scientific evidence demonstrates that shale gas extraction is safe, sustainable and of minimal disturbance to those living and working nearby, the pause in England will remain in place.” The British Geological Survey has been asked to investigate if there are any new fracking techniques that could be suitable for use in the UK, and how the size of tremors caused by extracting shale gas compares with other forms of underground energy production. The study will also look at whether there are other sites outside those identified in Lancashire that could be at a lower risk of tremors. Fracking is potentially polluting and disruptive to communities, and many experts say it would take up to a decade to reap any benefits, and the amount of gas would not make a dent in global prices. Where shale gas wells have been trialled, there has been major local opposition and anger because of earthquakes. Boris Johnson has resisted the permanent closure of two wells in Lancashire, which were set to be closed on 30 June. But furious Tory MPs said that by seeking to appease their colleagues on the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, which is pushing for the Lancashire wells to be kept open, Downing Street would ignite a row with a large number of other parliamentary colleagues. Some suspected the level of backlash would be so great that No 10 had put pressure on Kwarteng to make the announcement only in order to keep the option of a return to fracking open without ever properly examining it. Chris Skidmore, chair of the Net Zero Support Group, said that “red wall” constituencies would be likely to bear the brunt of new fracking sites: “I don’t see this being a serious proposition … It would be extremely damaging ahead of an election.” He added that the government should focus on “moving away from industries of the past” and that instead of spending millions of pounds on assets that “will deplete and become worthless”, ministers should instead support longer-term, renewable energy projects. The Tory MP Anthony Browne, chair of the cross-party environment parliamentary group, said it was “hard to find community support anywhere where shale gas extraction is being proposed”. Greenpeace also told Johnson to “stop pandering to fracking obsessives” and “get on with the quick, clean and cheap solutions like bringing in a windfall tax, cutting home energy waste, and bolstering our British solar, onshore and offshore wind”. But Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources Ltd, said the move by the government could represent “a tentative first step towards overturning the moratorium” on fracking. Meanwhile, Labour urged Johnson not to ditch planned higher onshore wind targets in the face of hostility from some of his backbenchers. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said Britain’s energy policy was “being held to ransom by Tory MPs” and that Labour would support more onshore wind, and back the plans in order for them to pass in the House of Commons.",News/Environment,"Ministers launch fracking study, paving way to end moratorium in England",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/05/ministers-launch-uk-fracking-study-paving-way-to-end-moratorium
4/6/2022,"Thomas Tuchel called on Chelsea’s supporters to raise the roof when the European champions host Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday night. The atmosphere at Stamford Bridge was muted when Chelsea lost 4-1 against Brentford last Saturday and Tuchel wants the crowd to give his players an extra push against Madrid. “We absolutely need it,” the German said. “We need to be better on pitch but we also need the crowd to be better. Everyone has to be on the front foot for a big opponent on the big occasions. “We normally have these atmospheres in evening games and big matches. In the Champions League matches they gave us a huge push in energy and atmosphere. It is crucial in these games. It’s much harder to play against the spectators as well. We felt it in Malmö and St Petersburg. We will face it again in Madrid next week and everyone needs to arrive tomorrow to support us.” Tuchel insisted he is not thinking about how Chelsea overwhelmed Madrid when the sides met in the semi-finals with no supporters allowed to attend last season. The La Liga leaders have replaced Zinedine Zidane with Carlo Ancelotti since that game and displayed their Champions League credentials when they mounted a brilliant comeback against Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 last month. “Last season has nothing to do with this game,” Tuchel said. “We didn’t look at it in our preparations. We looked at their last matches but not last year. We are out to bounce back from Saturday and to play in the right way – to be physical, intense and focused.” The message was not to underestimate Madrid, who have dipped since winning their third consecutive Champions League title in 2018. “It’s hard to keep the record,” Tuchel said. “It’s usual that cycles like this change at some point and maybe this what happened to them. But in terms of experience we should be aware that teams like this can produce special nights on special occasions.” Tuchel said he is not concerned about Andreas Christensen’s focus despite suggestions the defender has already agreed to join Barcelona on a free transfer this summer. “Maybe it’s a bit more challenging for him than normal,” he said. “But maybe he has cleared his future, I don’t know. “It was very clear when I had conversations with him last season, in summer, autumn and through winter. The bottom line is that as long as you are my player I expect you to be 100%. I won’t start digging into how much he can handle now because this is only a distraction. He was out on Saturday because it was a tactical choice to play a back four.” Ancelotti was forced to stay in Madrid after testing positive for Covid-19 and it remains to be seen if he is able to fly to London to face his former team. “It does affect the squad but nowadays you are in charge of virtual media so I am pretty sure he can do team talks,” Tuchel said. “I hope he can make it.” The tie takes place with Chelsea still waiting to see who buys the club from Roman Abramovich. Tuchel’s players have been dealing with huge uncertainty and Madrid’s goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, hopes his former club are able to move on from their difficulties soon. “I think it’s been a hard month for the club,” Courtois said. “You can see all the people who love Chelsea are putting their energy together so new owners know what club they are buying and to keep that blue spirit.” Courtois could receive a hostile reception from the crowd because of the way he left Chelsea for Madrid in 2018. “That’s in the past,” he said. “I won two league titles and two cups. Maybe my departure was less pleasant but it is always difficult to leave. I am here to win tomorrow.”",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel urges Chelsea fans to turn up volume against Real Madrid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/05/thomas-tuchel-urges-chelsea-fans-to-turn-up-volume-against-real-madrid
4/6/2022,"“Doctor, what did they do to him? Dad just doesn’t look the same. Please help him!” Of all the overnight admissions to the hospital, he looks the worst and the daughter’s cry pierces our heart. A year ago, a prolonged surgery and trips back to theatre to battle the complications affected his memory such that his equally elderly wife was no longer able to care for his needs and he entered a nursing home. One day, he develops a fever at the worst time, on a Friday afternoon. No doctor can visit him, and the nursing home quickly bundles him into an ambulance. The private hospital diagnoses a mild chest infection but now, it is Friday night, and the nursing home won’t have him back, citing a staff shortage. Under bright lights and noise, he becomes delirious. That night, he is prescribed a “gentle” sedative and when he grows more confused, an antipsychotic is added on top of the sedatives he was already taking. Then, following his attempts to free himself from bed, the sedative doses are increased. By Wednesday, his situation is so dire that the private hospital transfers him out to the public hospital, citing a lack of resources. As if this chain of events isn’t galling enough, this is what happens next. Shifted to another environment, his confusion worsens, and he takes a swipe at the “ants”. Thankfully, the astute resident who assesses him recognises that the answer to his problem is not more sedation but less. She correctly diagnoses that a dangerous cocktail of sedatives has caused a distressing, and potentially fatal, problem. The dishevelled patient is lying on a mattress placed on the floor, but he is now so still that I check his pulse to ensure he is alive. His sunken face and unstained hospital gown are a reminder that he has not eaten in days. His daughter is a nurse who observes that her father’s entire demeanour changed when he was prescribed sedation at the nursing home. The medication was initially charted as “prn”, pro re nata, Latin for when necessary, but within weeks, he was receiving nightly sedation because the staff said he slept better. Her initial relief was replaced by concern when she noticed that he had become slower, less engaged, and less confident walking. Cognisant that he could have progressive dementia, she nevertheless felt that the onset of his symptoms coincided so strongly with sedation that it warranted a drug review, only to be told that that was a “medical decision”. Given her stoic attempts to connect the dots, I feel contrite telling her that the geriatrician also agrees that her concern was justified. I make no promises as we set out to make things better. He is assigned a senior nurse who gently reorientates him several times a day. A student coaxes him to eat and sit out of bed. As he regains alertness, she plays a repetitive game of cards, smiling that it’s either that or putting up with the wandering. His daughter comes in after work and thumbs through old photos with her father. She feeds him dinner before going home, and tired from the days’ activities, he falls asleep soundly, without sedation. His dementia persists but his days aren’t as fraught. He is pleasant and calm and his daughter brands his recovery a miracle but what I see is that just like raising a child, it took a village to wean him off potent sedatives that were causing more harm than good. It is no surprise that this kind of involved care is simply unavailable in nursing homes. Antipsychotics, traditionally used for schizophrenia, are now commonly used for the behavioural symptoms of dementia. They show modest efficacy at best but often cause confusion and somnolence. Benzodiazepines are prescribed for insomnia, anxiety and agitation. While they can be effective in the short term, they are associated with the risk of confusion, falls and dependence. The aged care royal commission singled out the use of chemical restraints as an area of immediate action. It is estimated that roughly 10% of residents require some form of sedation to preserve their wellbeing but far, far more are prescribed drugs to make them more pliant. Last week, the Australian Senate approved legislation mandating the round-the-clock presence of a registered nurse in every nursing home. But given the protean vulnerabilities of residents, it is hard to imagine one nurse shouldering the whole burden of supervising sedation. Add the healthcare skills shortage to warnings that employing a registered nurse will make businesses unviable, and it’s doubtful that this change will be meaningful on its own. Could there be a better model of care? Australian researchers recruited 150 nursing homes containing more than 12,000 patients and found that at baseline, 37% of residents received daily sedation. Accounting for “as needed” sedation, the figure jumped to a worrying 54%. Next, they designed an interactive program to educate aged care workers about best practice in sedation. The results were impressive. Forty-one per cent of participating nursing home residents either reduced or ceased sedatives compared to a 4% rate reported in routine practice. The drugs were not replaced by substitutes. Contrary to expectations, reducing sedation did not lead to worsening behaviour but in fact improved the capacity to engage. The reduction in drug use was sustained and, unsurprisingly, the workers liked the program. A key element of success was the team of a “champion” nurse, pharmacist and doctor, each with a different perspective. One imagines that if the pharmacist asked, “Why is this patient on an antipsychotic?”, no one replied “Because the doctor said so”. And the nurse was elevated as a model of good practice. In other words, this was medical care that pushed hierarchy aside and put the patient at the centre. Education, collaboration and the headspace to devote to an alarming healthcare practice that robs many elders of vitality and life in their twilight years – surely this is what we would all want for ourselves and our loved ones. But I can’t help thinking that underlying all of this is another fundamental notion – that a society marks itself by how it cares for its elderly. Here, the responsibility falls to each of us to regard our elders with respect, advocate for their rights and refuse to consign them to a forgotten existence in a nursing home, known miserably as God’s waiting room. This is the standard our elders deserve. Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

4/6/2022,"With Robert Pattinson’s Batman currently impressing on the big screen, what better reason to look back at the role which The Batman director Matt Reeves credits as the catalyst for his casting. The Safdie brothers’ 2017 film Good Time is a tense, nervy, caffeine jolt of a crime thriller, which sees Pattinson in top form as a small-time crook, trying to save his brother over the course of 24 agonising hours. Connie Nikas (Pattinson) and his developmentally disabled brother Nick (co-director, Benny Safdie) rob a bank in New York but bungle the getaway. Nick is arrested while Connie manages to flee the scene. In a darkly amusing piece of irony, Connie attempts to bail his brother using the very same robbery proceeds they just stole. It’s not enough to spring Nick, so Connie scrambles to find $10,000 in a single night, as events spiral rapidly out of his control. Connie teams up with recent parolee, Ray (Buddy Duress), who knows where a bag of stolen money is hidden, stashed after another botched robbery. While it is definitively a bad idea in any sensible person’s assessment, the money represents Connie’s best (and only) hope of getting his brother out of Rikers Island. If one of the objectives of cinema is to make us feel something then, based on their recent output, the Safdie brothers want us to feel what it’s like to have a stress-induced aneurysm. Good Time is an expert lesson in uncomfortable tension; a twitchy, squirmy, wriggly succession of bad choices, a domino effect of consequences. In terms of stress, Good Time has only been bettered once: by the Safdie brothers themselves, when Uncut Gems sent audience blood pressure into the stratosphere two years later. An early scene in a bail bonds office is a perfect example of Good Time’s simmering apprehension. The bondsman is on two simultaneous phone calls, trying to locate Nick in the prison system while, in the background, Connie’s girlfriend Corey (an unsurprisingly excellent Jennifer Jason Leigh) learns her credit card has been cancelled and hollers down the phone at her mother. There’s something extremely aggravating, yet riveting, in witnessing three different, irritated conversations intruding on one another. In a weird way Connie’s plight in Good Time is like Matt Damon’s in The Martian: in order to prevent a looming disaster from overwhelming him, he breaks everything down into a series of consecutive problems. Fix one, then the next. Unfortunately, Connie is no scientist, and to say he is impulse driven is a massive understatement. He can never focus on the bigger picture, so every new problem he deals with is triage. Connie is not a good person either. He uses people. He’s a sleazy opportunist. He literally gets his foot in the door, and then takes advantage. And this is where Pattinson’s performance really shines – we stick with a character we don’t really like. We still want to follow him across New York and we want to see him set Nick free. The film’s pulsing, electronic score, composed by Oneohtrix Point Never (aka Daniel Lopatin), is another contributing factor to Good Time’s intensity. Foot chases and quick escapes merge with the anxiety heightening cues, in a perfect symbiosis of score and visuals. Sometimes the music gives way to something resembling Blade Runner, as we follow Connie around the city from the air; a momentary respite from the mayhem on the ground, a chance to catch our breath. Good Time is not the best choice if you are looking to relax on a Friday night. But what’s the point of relaxing anyway? If you’re not chewing off your fingernails and screaming into a sofa cushion, how do you know you’re even alive? Good Time is an extraordinarily effective thriller, a reminder that your heart’s still beating.",Arts/Film,You’ll have a bad time watching Good Time – but you’ll never feel so alive,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/06/youll-have-a-bad-time-watching-good-time-but-youll-never-feel-so-alive
4/6/2022,"Thousands of Australian Federal Police (AFP) members are demanding the next commonwealth government establish a strong anti-corruption commission that equally investigates politicians and law enforcement, saying police are being unfairly blamed for gaps in the nation’s integrity system. The Australian Federal Police Association, which represents 4,000 AFP members, has placed the establishment of a “far-reaching anti-corruption body” among its highest priorities ahead of the federal election, alongside improved support for officers suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, greater resourcing, and stronger firearms regulations. The association says the current anti-corruption regime is unequal, holding law enforcement to a far higher standard than politicians. That’s despite politicians having “different but no less extraordinary powers as those held by members of law enforcement agencies, particularly around the awarding of significant funding of public monies”. The lack of a federal anti-corruption commission is also placing the AFP in an invidious position when it is asked to investigate matters of public sector corruption. Police say that, in recent years, they have been unable to lay charges over a number of allegations due to the difficulties in proving criminal conduct in such cases and a lack of powers afforded to other state-based anti-corruption commissions, such as the power to compel witnesses. The job of detecting corruption is also highly complex, the association says. The AFPA also says its members face public criticism when they are hamstrung and unable to act on referrals made to them. “It has led to hardworking AFP employees being subject to unfair criticism and the independence of investigators being unjustifiably criticised,” the AFPA’s election report says. “This is unfair and unfounded, and a commonwealth anti-corruption body would go far to address this.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Coalition promised an anti-corruption commission prior to the last election. But its proposal, widely criticised as weak and ineffective, never came to fruition. The proposed integrity commission would also have created an unequal system which applied a tougher regime to members of law enforcement, including the prospect of public hearings. Inquiries into alleged public sector corruption would have been heard in private. The president of the AFPA, Alex Caruana, said members were chiefly concerned that any new anti-corruption commission would create a “two-tier system”. “It implies that Australian federal police officers are more likely to do something untoward, which isn’t true,” he said. “When you look at the responsibility or the discretionary power that a police officer has for buying things or handing out contracts, a politician can hand out multimillion dollar contracts to whoever they want without any real rigour.” The AFPA is now asking candidates to commit to the items on their election wishlist. It will then inform 7,000 AFP employees, their families, and the community about each party’s position. Labor has already committed to an anti-corruption commission with the strength and powers of a standing royal commission, including the ability to hold public hearings. Among the other priorities the AFPA has listed is stronger action to help police officers who suffer post-traumatic stress disorder. The association wants a presumption in workplace compensation laws that AFP members who develop PTSD and other psychological conditions did so as a result of their employment. Police officers should also be entitled to a new “blue card” system, similar to veteran healthcare cards, and the AFPA wants the government to establish a national commissioner for first responder mental health and suicide. The AFP should be expanded to 8,500 baselines employees by 2025, the AFPA says, and should be exempt from the efficiency dividend applying to federal government departments and agencies.",News/Australia news,Australian federal police demand parties commit to ‘far-reaching anti-corruption body’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/australian-federal-police-demand-parties-commit-to-far-reaching-anti-corruption-body
4/6/2022,"The principal of a Blue Mountains high school has had a prestigious Harvard scholarship put on hold while her school is investigated by the New South Wales Department of Education. The internal departmental investigation comes on top of two court cases involving staff or students at the school. On Monday, the Katoomba high school (KHS) principal, Jenny Boyall, wrote to parents after the Sunday Telegraph reported on an ongoing rape trial involving two former students of the school dating back to 2019. “I understand that these reports may be distressing and I would like to reassure you that student and safety wellbeing is always our critical priority,” Boyall said. It came after posters were put up anonymously around Katoomba last week, urging KHS students to report rape or sexual assault allegations to police strikeforce Woolalla. “Make KHS rape free,” the posters said. Police have confirmed the existence of the strikeforce, but not detailed whether it is investigating further allegations beyond the one in court. A male was charged with eight counts sexual assault without consent, one count of intentionally choking and one count of common assault. The now former student pleaded not guilty in the children’s court and a verdict is expected in May. He cannot be identified for legal reasons. In an unrelated matter, a teacher at the school was jailed in 2020 after he was found guilty of having sex with a student in 2019. Separately, the NSW Department of Education has been conducting its own professional and ethical standards (PES) investigation into the school since late 2020. The ongoing departmental probe was asked to investigate a complaint made by a parent about alleged failures in the school’s response to claims that male students were harassing female students. In May 2021, about six months after the investigation began, Boyall was awarded a $16,000 scholarship by the Public Education Foundation and the Harvard Club of Australia. The scholarship funds the recipient to attend a short professional education program at Harvard’s graduate school in the US. When the award was announced, a statement from the department described the educator as an “exceptional leader” who displayed “outstanding leadership”. The department’s then acting secretary, Georgina Harrisson, said Boyall “epitomises our ambition that no matter where our students live they have access to a quality education” and praised her role in leading the school during the pandemic and other challenges. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The scholarship was suspended in December after organisers were made aware of the department’s investigation, which was originally expected to take nine months. But in November 2021, the department wrote a letter, seen by Guardian Australia, that said it would take longer. “The allegations are serious, a large volume of evidence has been obtained and delays beyond the control of PES have occurred,” the letter said. “PES resources are finite, and the investigation’s progress is balanced against the progress of other competing investigations.” In response to questions about the internal investigation and police matters, the department said in a statement it was “unable to comment on proceedings currently before the courts and the media is urged to respect this process”. “Staff and students at Katoomba high school are being well supported and a newsletter was issued to parents and carers,” the department said.

4/6/2022,"Expectant mothers are unable to afford some antenatal consultations, the peak body representing GPs says, as doctors call on the federal government to raise the Medicare rebate. Dr Karen Price, the president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, says there have been significant advances in antenatal care over the years but Medicare patient rebates had not kept pace with the costs of providing it. In a letter to the health minister Greg Hunt, Price said designated Medicare items for antenatal care – which pay $41.70 regardless of the duration of the appointment – do not reflect the growing complexity of consultations during pregnancy. “Antenatal consultations today involve extensive monitoring of health problems and potential complications, such as diabetes and anaemia,” she said. “GPs also provide advice on nutrition and physical activity and help prepare the new mother for childbirth and breastfeeding.” As a result, Price said, antenatal care is often highly complex and consultations can extend well beyond 20 minutes – the time covered by the rebate. “This is particularly true for vulnerable and disadvantaged patient groups, such as those in rural and remote communities, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients and culturally and linguistically diverse patients,” she said. “However, current Medicare funding for patients does not allow for longer consultations.” Price said she wanted the government to amend level C and D Medicare Benefits Schedule general attendance items, which are for longer GP consultations, so that GPs can use them for antenatal appointments that are longer than 20 minutes. Guardian Australia has contacted Hunt’s office for comment. There have been calls for rebate increases in a number of areas. A Senate committee’s interim report into GP and related primary health services in outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas recommended substantially increasing Medicare rebates for general practice consultations. After last month’s federal budget, the Australian Association of Psychologists called for the Medicare rebate for clients of all psychologists to be raised to $150. But Margaret Faux, a lawyer and expert in Medicare claiming and compliance, said any further changes to Medicare item descriptions and rebates should not occur until structural problems within Medicare are first addressed. Faux said the entire Medicare billing system was in need of reform, with some health providers failing to bill correctly because the system was so complicated. “Changing the descriptions of level C and D consults is highly technical and complex work and if rushed may worsen the already challenging compliance issues that GPs face,” she said. “A better solution, in the short term, is to use existing Medicare Billing Scheme item numbers and enable co-claiming.” Co-claiming is when two Medicare item numbers can be claimed at the same time, such as a consultation and stitching a laceration. In the case of pregnant women, Faux said, it should be made possible to claim, for example, one item for clinical needs and another item for mental health needs.

4/6/2022,"The Morrison government has been accused of sitting on a major report card on the state of Australia’s environment it received more than three months ago to avoid “more bad news”. Labor, the Greens, the independent MP Zali Steggall, environment groups and scientists have called on the government to release the Australia State of the Environment report, which is produced by scientists and compiled every five years. The latest report, the first since 2016, was handed to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, in December. The minister is required to table the report in parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving it. With an election expected to be called within days and parliament having sat only briefly this year, the government is not legally required to release it until the next parliament forms. In an estimates hearing last week, Labor and Greens senators pushed the government to set a date for tabling the report but were told only that the minister would comply with her statutory obligations. Labor’s environment spokesperson, Terri Butler, called on the government to release the report before Australians cast their votes in May. “It is a disgrace that the Morrison-Joyce government are sitting on this important five-yearly report,” she said. “What are they hiding? “Australians deserve to know how the environment has fared under the Morrison-Joyce government so they can decide whether they want a second decade of the same mismanagement.” The Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, questioned why Ley had not released the report when she had received the finished document months ago. “The government must release it before the election is called,” she said. “Voters deserve to know the official state of the environment under this government and what they are voting on.” The independent MP Zali Steggall, said the 2016 report painted a dire picture for nature, with the authors writing Australia’s environment was under increasing pressure from land-clearing, population growth, climate change, urban and industrial development and pests. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She accused the government of sitting on the report because it would deliver “more bad news” and “would drive home the environmental negligence of this Coalition government”. The State of the Environment report follows a series of official reviews that have assessed the performance of Australian governments in protecting the environment. The 2020 review of Australia’s national environmental laws, chaired by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel, found successive governments had failed to stem the decline of Australia’s wildlife and called for an overhaul of environmental protections. Last month, a review by the auditor general found the federal government could not demonstrate it was protecting Australia’s endangered wildlife because it was not monitoring most species, habitats or threats and there was limited evidence conservation plans were implemented. Euan Ritchie, a professor of ecology and conservation at Deakin University, said reports such as the State of the Environment were important because they showed what needed to change to address Australia’s dire conservation record. Jess Abrahams, the Australian Conservation Foundation’s nature campaigner, said Australians had a right to know the scale of the nature crisis ahead of the election. He pointed to the recent endangered listings of both the koala and the gang-gang cockatoo and the crash in bogong moth populations as high profile examples of how Australia’s environment was faring. “This decline isn’t some sort of accident – it’s happening on the federal government’s watch and is a result of federal government decisions,” he said. Suzanne Milthorpe, the national environment laws campaign manager at the Wilderness Society, said release of the report was vital at a time when the impacts of climate change were being felt in floods and fire across the country. “Regardless of who wins the upcoming election, the next parliament will have to take urgent action to fix Australia’s environment laws to safeguard nature and communities,” she said. A spokesperson for Ley said “the report will be released within the statutory time frame set out under the act”.

4/6/2022,"Domestic violence and sexual assault survivor Grace* knows first-hand the discrimination experienced by ex-prisoners while job hunting. The 27-year-old floated between the criminal justice system and attempts to find work, having been locked up for theft and drug possession. “I was living on the dole and struggling to live,” she told Guardian Australia. “With a criminal record I got to a point where I had nowhere to go because of my history. “When I came out [of prison] it was pretty much was like a revolving door. I struggled because I didn’t have the qualifications and support networks … a lot of businesses don’t give people like me a second chance.” During her last stint in prison for aggravated burglary, Grace made a vow to herself to never return to jail, having separated from her abusive partner and reconnecting with her family. Within seven weeks of leaving prison, she was hired in a traffic control position for a major roads project and two years later remains in the role. “It’s been the biggest life changer for me – that I actually have something that I’ve got to lose and I’m happy,” she told Guardian Australia. “I’ve been given a second chance in life to strive to work and to not get in the wrong company. It’s something I never want to lose.” Last month, a wide-ranging parliamentary inquiry into the state’s criminal justice system found the existing approaches to incarceration were not reducing crime. The final report said 44% of people who leave jail will return to prison within two years. The report found unemployment was a key compounding factor, and recommended additional government funding to attempt to curb recidivism. Grace participated in the Victorian government’s employment pathways program to receive mentoring and find employment. The program provides specialist support such as resume and interview skills, and while in prison offenders are encouraged to participate in work or vocational education and training across sectors such as food processing, warehousing and agriculture. It also includes helping former prisoners improve their literacy, numeracy and digital skills. Three specialist Jobs Victoria services work with former offenders and people in the justice system – a total investment of $6.7m. The latest statistics show that of the 1,500 ex-offenders participating in the program, more than 640 have stayed in the jobs for at least six months. The government will provide funding for another 1,000 ex-offenders to help them transition into the workforce over the next two years. Natalie Hutchins, the corrections minister, said education, training and employment were vital to successful rehabilitation and reintegration into wider society. “It helps ex-offenders change the way they think about themselves and discover ways to contribute to the community,” she said. The employment minister, Jaala Pulford, said the program helped to change lives and reduce repeat offending by giving people the skills to get a job and keep it. “Businesses also benefit from having access to workers who have been mentored about what’s needed to be successful in their new roles,” she said. The Productivity Commission’s latest report on government services found that in the 2020-21 financial year the rate of prisoners returning to prison in Victoria was 43.6% – a slight decrease from 44.2% in 2019-20. * Her name has been changed to protect her identity",News/Australia news,Life after prison: Victoria expands jobs program for ex-offenders in bid to reduce recidivism,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/life-after-prison-victoria-expands-jobs-program-for-ex-offenders-in-bid-to-reduce-recidivism
4/6/2022,"Laura Valencic has never had the luxury of calling the “bank of mum and dad” to help her buy a home. After the federal government announced more places under the first home guarantee scheme in the budget, Valencic feels like she finally has an in. But she’s wary of a potential pitfall in the future: will she be able to afford the mortgage repayments when interest rates rise? “If anything happens and we can’t pay it, we can’t pay it,” said the 27-year-old from the home she shares with her partner in Appin, south of Sydney. “We don’t have anyone to fall back on.” The Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, in February urged people to be prudent with their borrowing and to build a buffer to withstand an increase in mortgage repayments, given interest rate rises this year are “plausible”. Financial experts are also warning people entering the home guarantee scheme to “go in with their eyes wide open”. For people in Sydney who buy a home under the scheme this year, with a 5% deposit at the capped $800,000 price, their mortgage repayments will rise by about $539 a month by the end of 2024, according to RateCity. The house’s equity could also drop by 6% at the same time, meaning they would owe the bank more than the house was worth. “The concern is [the government] is providing people with a way to spend an incredibly large amount of money on a property at overheated prices,” said Sally Tindall, research director at RateCity, which calculated the impact on mortgage repayments and home equity using forecasts by Westpac. “Regulators are saying hold off while the government is saying jump in.” The Morrison government announced the scheme, which was first outlined in 2019, would be more than doubled to 50,000 places. It allows people to buy a home with as little as a 5% deposit and scraps lender’s mortgage insurance. Tindall said those who bought under this scheme when it first launched have enjoyed huge success as house prices soared by a record 24% last year. But she warned “we are now looking down the barrel of a very different property market”. “[The government] are not looking at the root problem, which is that house prices are too high.” The minister for housing, homelessness, and social and community housing, Michael Sukkar, said almost 35,000 additional social and affordable homes would be delivered by the Morrison government. This would be done via the additional $2 billion in funding flagged for the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, and $1 billion for the housing-enabling infrastructure facility. “Under the home guarantee scheme, 60,000 Australians have already been supported into home ownership. We want to help even more Australians into their first home or a home that they’ve built for their family, which is why we are expanding the scheme,” Sukkar said. Sukkar also said the state governments and local councils needed to step up and increase the supply of housing to help address affordability: “We strongly encourage states to rethink their prohibitive taxes and regulatory bottlenecks.” A concern of Valencic’s is that the high price of houses does not leave much room for the buffer that the RBA recommends. Nor it is likely she would have leftover cash to renovate the fixer-uppers that are in her price range. The average home price in her area has risen from $722,500 in 2020, to $882,500 in 2021. Valencic and her partner have saved more than the 5% deposit needed, but she suspects this money will be eaten up by stamp duty and other moving costs. Eliza Owens, head of Australian research at CoreLogic, said she doesn’t think there’s a heightened risk of first-home buyers defaulting on their mortgage under the scheme. But she said it’s important people understand the risks, particularly as the scheme targets younger people who may have less understanding of how interest rates work. “You need to understand interest costs are higher when you take out a low-deposit loan.

People need to rigorously assess if they can ride out the peaks and troughs of the market once they buy, Owens said. Kate Colvin, a spokesperson for Everybody’s Home, said the “scheme is a Band-Aid for runaway house prices”. “We’ve got long-term problems in the housing market that need more fundamental fixes, and those fixes are reducing the benefits to investors from negative gearing and from the capital gains tax discount.” The office of the minister for housing, Michael Sukkar, was contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,Australia’s first-home buyers urged to ‘go in with eyes wide open’ about future rate rises,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/australias-first-home-buyers-urged-to-go-in-with-eyes-wide-open-about-future-rate-rises
4/6/2022,"Puberty Blues holds a special place in the heart of many Australians. First, it was the book that scandalised 1970s audiences for its frank depictions of teenage sex, drug-taking and pregnancy. Next came the 1981 movie adaptation that popularised the immortal sledge “fish-faced molls” and, some decades later, a TV series that brought the surfie saga to a new generation in 2012. The book is the work of Kathy Lette and Gabrielle Carey, who co-authored it as young adults while living together in a shared Sydney flat. For Lette, Puberty Blues was just the first release in a long career. In the years since, she’s penned many more bestsellers, as well as newspaper columns and TV series both here and abroad. Her latest release is Till Death, or a Little Light Maiming, Do Us Part – a novel that explores the ups and downs of romance for older women. Even though she now lives in London, Lette will always be a “Shire girl” at heart. After many years navigating the beach, the Cronulla expat has come to consider one item essential for hitting the sand – a terry towelling poncho. Here, Lette tells us why she won’t go for a swim without it in her bag, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. My honorary doctorate robes. I left school at 16. As an autodidact (obviously it’s a word I taught myself) I’ve always been more of an imminent – rather than eminent – intellectual. When the University of Wollongong rang to discuss the academic robes I’d be wearing to receive my honorary doctorate, they asked for my head measurement. “Well, it was much smaller before you asked me that question!” I confessed. I welded that academic hat to my cranium. I’ve worn it shopping, bushwalking and while jogging along Cronulla beach, where I grew up. Actually I think I’ll get the hat waterproofed so that I can wear it when boogie boarding, to really flaunt the fact that this ex-surfie girl now surfs her brain waves. I now have three framed honorary doctorates which I cherish. What I’m really holding out for is a Companion of Literature which is abbreviated, apparently, to C.Lit. What more could a funny feminist ask for? When I was gushing with enthusiasm about my honorary degrees, my friend Stephen Fry emailed me a congratulatory missive which put things back into perspective. “Don’t forget, Kath,” he quipped, “it’s better to be an unqualified success than a qualified one.” But a Shire girl can have both, surely? As I’m in Australia right now, I’d have to say my solar powered vibrator. Although it’s the one object best not saved for a rainy day. And with La Niña in town, well, let’s just say that, all my Christmases did not come at once. My other most useful object is my beach poncho. This long terry towelling cocoon means I no longer accidentally flash the flesh while changing out of my wet cossie. No middle-aged mum wants to be seen naked by strangers – mainly because, well, our birthday suits probably need a little ironing. The tide would take one look at my bare arse, go out and refuse to come back in again. How many times have you been shedding your swimmers beneath the shield of a towel, when it’s slipped from your hands? The only thing to do is dive-bomb face down on to the sand in one deft movement – which merely results in a grazed nose and a bit of seaweed up your freckle. Once my towel blew away, and I was forced to crawl after it, on my elbows, like a commando, my face a few inches from the sand. But my big, beautiful beach poncho means I can simply slip off my cossie and drive home naked, with nobody the wiser. Bliss. It’s tempting to say my mind. But I lost that when I had babies. I also regret losing my hymen to a surfie in the back of his shaggin’ wagon.

4/6/2022,"A private company planning to build an $84m southern Queensland dam will be given $168.5m from the federal government for the project – prompting concerns that the extra money was allocated without proper scrutiny or due diligence. The 2019 detailed business case for the Emu Swamp Dam, near Stanthorpe, and all formal documents for the project estimate it will cost $84m to build. The Queensland Department of State Development says the same amount. Guardian Australia revealed last month that the dam project’s estimated construction costs had blown out, and that some irrigators had since pulled their investments, believing it was now unviable and would never be built. The proponent, Granite Belt Water Limited, did not respond to questions last month about the leaked cost blowout. The increased cost has not previously been acknowledged publicly. But on budget night, the federal government said it had allocated an additional $126.5m for the project, on top of more than $40m already set aside. The announcement was made without any explanation as to why the significant additional funds were now needed. The Queensland government previously pledged $13.6m to the project, and about 50 irrigators, who are members of Granite Belt Water Limited, have agreed to cover another $23.4m. With the federal money, the project now has $205.5m in funding. The cost blowout has raised serious concerns that the project now represents a waste of taxpayer money. Based on the proponent’s own business case, the cost of building the dam would significantly outweigh decades of economic benefit. The detailed business case found that, in a scenario using standard assumptions, the 12,000-megalitre dam and irrigation project would contribute – directly and indirectly – about $139m to the local economy over 30 years. The 2019 business case gave the $84m dam a benefit-cost score of 1.47 – or $1.47 in economic benefit return for every dollar invested. Assuming the $205.5m in committed funding is spent, the dam would return less than 65c in benefit for every dollar. Richard Denniss, the chief economist at the Australia Institute, said funding such projects was “not taking the job of managing Australia’s economy seriously”. “If you were going to be really generous to the proponents, maybe it stacked up at the original cost. But by their own analysis it clearly doesn’t stack up now,” Dennis said. “For decades previous finance ministers have said ‘no’ to crazy ideas like this. “[Funding these projects] is not taking the job of managing the Australian economy seriously.

That body was disbanded by the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, immediately after the federal budget. Stuart Khan, a member of the advisory body, had previously written to members to express concern that the government was considering diverting additional funding to New South Wales-based dam projects, which were subject to cost blowouts but where no additional studies or scrutiny had taken place. Regardless of the funding, the Emu Swamp Dam project is at a “pause” phase, and the proponent faces significant practical challenges before being able to start spending its money. Those challenges include the need to secure additional water allocations to fill the dam, and the need to acquire several properties at the proposed dam site. A local newspaper, Stanthorpe Today, has reported that some landowners are at loggerheads with the proponent over the sale of their properties. Some small farmers and others in the Stanthorpe area are opposed to the dam. They say the project will benefit about 50 irrigators who are members of Granite Belt Water and have invested in the project in order to secure an allocation. They say public money is needed for genuine water security projects that benefit the entire community. “You have to ask how did the 2019 business case get [the construction cost] so wrong?” said Melissa Hamilton from the group Protect Our Water. “Arguably the entire business case should be referred for independent review. Taxpayers deserve a rigorous, consistent and transparent assessment of the costs and benefits of all options. “A proper merit-based assessment would ensure the best use of taxpayer dollars to improve the long-term water security of the whole Granite Belt community, rather than just 50 irrigators.” Granite Belt Water Limited did not respond to questions. In a statement released after the federal budget, the company did not acknowledge a construction cost blowout or say why the additional money was needed, but welcomed the funding. The company’s chief executive, Lloyd Taylor, said: “This project will not only increase water security to the region, it will also create a significant number of jobs during construction, as well as long-term full-time positions in agriculture and supporting businesses, to help substantially grow the productivity of southern Queensland.”",News/Australia news,‘Reckless public spending’: Coalition’s extra $126m for Queensland dam draws fire,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/reckless-public-spending-coalitions-extra-126m-for-queensland-dam-draws-fire
4/6/2022,"Given the day’s importance and the many long months he and his family had dreamed of it, Jorge would probably have preferred a special guest appearance by Tony Stark, Dr Bruce Banner or Marshall the fire pup from Paw Patrol. Or, better still, all three. But in the end he had to make do with a surprise visit from Pedro Sánchez. At 12.45pm on Tuesday, surrounded by friends and teachers – and Spain’s prime minister – Jorge fulfilled the biggest ambition of his 12 years by standing up, walking over to his classmates, and playing with them. To do so, Jorge, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, was placed into the state-of-the-art exoskeleton that has changed his life over the past two years, and which could offer millions of children a previously unthinkable degree of movement. Jorge’s mother, Eva Muñoz-Torrero, said she would never forget the first time he put on the exoskeleton: “He said, ‘You can keep the wheelchair. I’m having this now and I’m taking it home’.” Ever since then, he had begged to be able to take the equipment out of the therapy room he visits twice a week and into his school just outside Madrid. On his 12th birthday, Jorge got his wish. As he walked into the room where his friends were waiting, he was met with cheers, applause, and the tears that glossed the eyes of a stocky, bullet-headed member of the prime minister’s security detail. Marsi Bionics, the company that designed the exoskeleton, describes the kit as “the only paediatric exoskeleton in the world that allows the child to move around freely”, and says its uniqueness lies in the elastic technology that adapts to the user’s body. The firm, which has been running a clinical trial with Madrid’s La Paz hospital and Spain’s National Research Council, says the equipment could help the 17 million children worldwide whose neurological impairments prevent them from walking. “There’s nothing more beautiful than seeing a child in their school and playing with their friends,” said Elena García Armada, the co-founder and CEO. But the enormous potential the exoskeleton offers doesn’t come cheap. While Jorge’s family has managed to cover the costs of the therapy – which can reach €30,000 a year – through crowdfunding, not everyone is so fortunate. “The exoskeleton is a dream but it’s not right that it should only be available to families who can arrange crowdfunding and a massive investment so that their child can walk,” said Muñoz-Torrero. She would like more families to be able to witness the changes she has seen in her son. Although Jorge has never lacked discipline, determination or an unflagging sense of humour, the exoskeleton has given him and the family a massive motivational boost. “It’s also really raised Jorge’s self-esteem,” she said. “He doesn’t want to sit in his chair in a corner. He wants to get involved.” Once the presents had been given, the piñata looted and the happy birthdays sung, Jorge went back to class in his wheelchair. As the prime minister and his retinue departed and the TV cameras beckoned, Muñoz-Torrero offered a brief summary of the morning’s achievements. “This has been a really important step because we’ve shown how important it is to get technology to people with disabilities,” she said. “But, more personally, this was what Jorge had wanted since the first day: he wanted to have his friends at his side as he stood up and walked. And he’s fulfilled that dream.”",News/World news,‘It’s a dream’: exoskeleton allows boy with cerebral palsy to walk and play,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/its-a-dream-exoskeleton-allows-boy-to-walk-and-play
4/6/2022,"Ivanka Trump will testify before the January 6 committee on Tuesday. The Guardian confirmed that former president Donald Trump’s oldest daughter, and former senior White House adviser, will speak to the panel virtually. Her testimony will come after that of her husband and fellow former presidential adviser, Jared Kushner, who spoke to the panel for more than six hours last week. After Kushner’s testimony, Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and a member of the committee, told the Guardian: “There’s a momentum to this process when there’s cooperation. When people see that others are doing the right thing, it gives them the courage to do the right thing.” A bipartisan Senate report linked seven deaths to the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, by supporters Donald Trump told to “fight like hell” in service of his attempt to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection but acquitted when enough Republican senators stayed loyal. The House’s January 6 committee includes two Republicans, Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. As the Guardian reported this week, the committee has identified Ivanka Trump as a senior adviser who would have known her father’s attempt to block certification of electoral college results at the Capitol was unlawful. Referring to a law professor who presented the plan to block certification, a federal judge recently said it was “more likely than not that President Trump and Dr [John] Eastman dishonestly conspired to obstruct the joint session of Congress on January 6 2021”, and thereby committed multiple felonies. Also in Washington on Tuesday, Enrique Tarrio, a former leader of the far-right Proud Boys group, pleaded not guilty to felony charges including conspiracy to block the certification by Congress of electoral college results on January 6. Five other members of the group have pleaded not guilty to the charge. The January 6 committee also hopes Ivanka Trump might help explain a more-than seven-hour gap in White House call logs for the day of the Capitol attack. Ivanka Trump’s role in her father’s administration has long been a lightning rod for controversy. On Monday, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) said: “Here’s a question Ivanka Trump can answer: how did she and Jared make up to $640m while working ‘for free’ in the White House?”",News/US news,Ivanka Trump to testify before panel investigating Capitol attack,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/05/ivanka-trump-capitol-attack-committee-january-6
4/6/2022,"The world economy may be on the cusp of a new inflationary era with persistently higher growth in consumer prices due to the retreat of globalisation, a leading central bank chief has said. Agustín Carstens, head of the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements – which is known as the central bank of central banks – said there was a strong risk that prices would rise uncontrollably without a sharp rise in interest rates above existing plans. In a speech setting out risks for persistently higher rates of inflation, Carstens said higher borrowing costs could be required for several years to curb the risk of spiralling prices wreaking long-term damage on the economies of the industrialised world. However, his comments are disputed as other experts warn that high inflation will probably choke consumer spending and economic growth – reducing the urgency for significantly higher interest rates. Data has shown inflation heading towards 10% in several countries, mostly in response to rising gas and oil prices after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. In February, the consumer prices index hit 6.2% in the UK – the highest level since the 1990s. In March, the CPI in Germany and Spain hit 7.3% and 9.8% respectively. The Bank of England is on course to raise its base rate to 2% next year according to City investors, up from the current level of 0.75% after Threadneedle Street began hiking rates from a record low of 0.1% in December last year. Last month the US Federal Reserve approved a 0.25 percentage point hike from near zero, the first increase since December 2018, with a signal it plans several more rate rises this year. Carstens said a trend for manufacturers to cut back extensive global supply chains in response to the pre-pandemic trade war between the US and China and, more recently, sanctions on Russia, meant production costs would be higher for a longer period than central banks and independent economists currently estimate. “What starts as temporary can become entrenched, as behaviour adapts if what starts that way goes far enough and lasts long enough. It’s hard to establish where that threshold lies, and we may find out only after it has been crossed,” he said. Carstens’ speech in Geneva challenges the outlook put forward by the Bank of England, which estimates that inflation should begin to fall next year after only a modest rise in interest rates. Earlier this week, the Bank’s deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe, suggested comparisons with the 1970s when inflation was persistently higher were unrealistic. He said changes to the UK labour market since the 1970s – when trade union membership was at its peak – meant workers do not have the same power to demand higher wages to compensate for higher inflation. This would make it unlikely for the UK to experience a wage-price spiral, whereby workers demanding higher pay leads companies to raise their prices. Unlike Carstens, who said there was a risk of high inflation becoming entrenched in the public consciousness, Cunliffe said there were few signs of this so far. “I do not think we are yet seeing a psychology of persistently higher inflation emerge,” he said. “I am not at present convinced that we will inevitably have to lean heavily and constantly against an embedding of an inflationary psychology.”",News/Business,"World may be on cusp of new inflationary era, says central bank chief",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/05/world-may-be-on-cusp-of-new-inflationary-era-says-central-bank-chief
4/6/2022,"The managing director of Manchester airport has quit after weeks of chaos in which thousands of passengers have missed their flights because of queues up to seven hours long. Karen Smart stepped down on Tuesday after coming under fierce criticism from airport staff as well as angry travellers. She had been in the post for two years, during a turbulent time in aviation history. “Having taken on the position at the start of the pandemic, she has decided now is the time to return to the south of England, where her family is based, to pursue fresh career opportunities,” Manchester Airports Group (MAG) said in a statement. Ian Costigan, MAG’s group transformation director, will take on the role of interim managing director and will be responsible for delivering the programmes of recruitment needed to increase operational capacity over the summer. Smart had been due to meet Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, on Tuesday, as well as Unite, the union. Travellers have faced long delays and chaotic scenes, with queues trailing outside terminals to reach check-in and hordes of people waiting to get through security and to pick up luggage. One man told the BBC on Sunday that he waited seven hours, missing his flight, and saw “sick on the floor with no one clearing it up” as people queued in a “boiling hot confined area”. Piles of suitcases have been left in terminals after travellers abandoned the wait to reclaim their baggage and instead headed home. One airport worker publicly quit this week over what he called “dangerous” and “chaotic” operations. Ray Ellis, who had worked at the airport since 1994 and had been a health and safety representative, said he was speaking out because he was “genuinely concerned for passenger safety”. Passengers have reported airport disruption for several weeks, long before school Easter holidays, with one regular user deciding to switch to the train to travel to France. Paul Doran, 35, a commodities trader who lives in Liverpool, flies to his employer’s Paris office about once a month, and last flew from Manchester airport on 16 March. Despite arriving at the airport three hours before his flight carrying only hand luggage, it took him so long to get through security that he arrived at the gate at the time his flight was due to take off. “The queue for security started in the drop-off car park,” Doran said, adding that the airline delayed the flight’s departure to give queueing passengers a chance to arrive. “It’s a failure of planning. People were clearly going to start travelling again as soon as they could. It was entirely foreseeable,” he said. “I’m not sure how the airport was caught cold. It’s not like a bus, where they are not sure who will be there.” The airport, along with much of the aviation industry, has struggled to recruit staff made redundant after the pandemic shutdown of airports and travel. As the Easter getaway increases travel, similar problems have hit other airports including Heathrow and Birmingham. More than 1,000 UK flights have been axed in recent days due to crews being off sick amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Industry experts said airlines and airports were struggling because of the number of job cuts made during the pandemic. John O’Neill, a north-west regional industrial officer for Unite, said that after mass redundancies due to Covid, some workers had found alternative jobs with similar wages and might not be willing to return to work at the airport doing unsociable hours for similar rates of pay. O’Neill said: “There is a huge problem with recruitment, a massive problem with recruitment. This is the test for summer, the Easter break is the test for summer. Summer is going to be far worse than this. It is the time to get everything in place otherwise summer is going to very difficult.” MAG, which also runs Stansted and East Midlands airport, is partly owned by the 10 local authorities of Greater Manchester, with the biggest stake held by Manchester council. The Australian investment firm IFM Investors owns a 35% stake. The MAG airport website is currently offering jobs for drivers with a starting salary of £13,000 a year and security “ambassador” jobs targeted to students paying £10.53 an hour, including nightshifts, 3am starts, weekends and bank holidays. The chief executive of MAG, Charlie Cornish, said: “Over the last two years Karen has guided Manchester airport through the most challenging period of its 84-year history, having made a major contribution to MAG throughout her time with the business. “I am sorry to lose Karen after her years of valuable service, but also understand her desire to return to the south for family reasons and indeed to explore new career opportunities. While there are sure to be further challenges ahead, I am confident we will soon start to see the benefits of the recovery plans Karen has helped put in place and look forward to working with Ian and his leadership team to drive them forward.”",News/UK news,Manchester airport manager quits after weeks of chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/05/manchester-airport-manager-quits-after-weeks-of-chaos
4/6/2022,"Britain will work with the US and Australia in developing nuclear-capable hypersonic weapons, after Russia used the deadly high-speed missiles in airstrikes last month during the war in Ukraine. The military agreement – endorsed by Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison – is a new element in the Aukus pact, originally announced last autumn to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Canberra. A statement from all three leaders announced a further expansion of the agreement, described as “new trilateral cooperation on hypersonics and counter-hypersonic” weapons, part of a growing militarisation after the Russian invasion. China has tested its own version of the weapons, and the Aukus leaders are keen to be seen to be presenting a united front against Beijing and Moscow. “Our ability to determine their use and to counter their use will be important part of maintaining stability right across the world,” a British official said. The US quietly tested its own hypersonic missile last month, although it kept details secret for a fortnight for fear of antagonising Russia, and it is already collaborating with Australia. The agreement means Britain is now engaged for the first time. Stephen Lovegrove, the UK’s national security adviser, said the latest announcement demonstrated the development of Aukus. “In light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it’s more important now than ever that allies work together to defend democracy, international law and freedom around the world,” he added. Hypersonic missiles – whether nuclear or not – travel at at least five times the speed of sound, faster than conventional cruise missiles. They are designed to be manoeuvrable, allowing them, in theory, to evade conventional missile defences. However, it is unclear if they have any genuine military utility, and critics say their development is contributing to a deepening international rearmament in response to the Ukraine crisis. Biden said last month that Russia had used its Kinzhal hypersonic missile against Ukrainian targets, describing it as “a consequential weapon” that was “almost impossible to stop”. Russia said it had used them twice, against targets near Mykolaiv and elsewhere in the west of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has previously praised the Kinzhal and weapons like it, saying four years ago that “its speed makes it invulnerable” and that it was “quite understandable why the leading armies of the world seek to possess such an ideal weapon”. But others have voiced scepticism. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said he would “not see it as a gamechanger”, and other experts see them simply as modified versions of Russian Iskander ballistic missiles, which are launched from a plane against a target. China has been testing hypersonic weapons using a different technology, known as the hypersonic glide vehicle, in which the missiles are initially launched into space and then attached to dedicated aerodynamic craft designed to bring them down to their targets on Earth. The UK, US and Australia intend to work on researching both types of hypersonic technology – missiles and glide vehicles – and examine ways of countering the threat they may pose. “We need to understand how the overall targeting system of our adversaries might work,” a British official said. Pentagon officials have assessed that hypersonic weapons will add $21.5bn (£16.4bn) to the navy’s budget and $7bn to the army’s in coming years, although the estimates are tentative as the technology emerges. British sources, however, said the UK had not committed to buying any hypersonic weapons, and is only engaged in a research and development phase before deciding how to proceed. Kate Hudson, the general secretary of the pressure group CND, said she believed the extension of the Aukus pact would “further escalate global tensions at a time when the threat of nuclear war is at its highest in decades”, and it risked accelerating an arms race with China in the Asia-Pacific. “Not to mention the fact that military budgets are already escalating – what will the opportunity cost be for embarking on a whole new class of weaponry?” Hudson added. The joint progress report will be seen as politically helpful to Morrison, whose Coalition government in Canberra is trailing Labor in the polls as it prepares for a federal election expected on 14 or 21 May. Morrison, who is expected to formally trigger the election campaign within days, is seeking to make national security one of his key themes, arguing that the world is facing “uncertain times” and it is not a moment for “weakness”.",News/Politics,Aukus pact extended to development of hypersonic weapons,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/05/aukus-pact-extended-to-development-of-hypersonic-weapons
4/6/2022,"Boris Johnson will struggle to get his plans to privatise Channel 4 through parliament after a backlash from within his party, senior Conservatives believe. The plans to raise £1bn-plus by selling off the state-owned channel sparked furious opposition from people such as Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Tory leader, and former cabinet ministers Damian Green and Jeremy Hunt. Senior Tories told the Guardian that Johnson would probably struggle to get his plans through the House of Lords, and could face a revolt in the Commons as well. The proposal was not in the Conservative party manifesto, making it easier for peers to challenge the legislation necessary to make the sale. The backlash came after an internal Channel 4 email revealed that the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, was pushing ahead with plans to privatise the channel after 40 years in public ownership. Davidson led calls for the government to reconsider, saying: “Channel 4 is publicly owned, not publicly funded. It doesn’t cost the taxpayer a penny. It also, by charter, commissions content but doesn’t make/own its own. It’s one of the reasons we have such a thriving [independent] sector in places like Glasgow. This is the opposite of levelling up.” Green pointed out the channel was founded by a Conservative government, with part of its remit being to boost Britain’s private sector television sector: “The sale of Channel 4 is politicians and civil servants thinking they know more about how to run a business than the people who run it. Very unconservative. Mrs Thatcher, who created it, never made that mistake.” Julian Knight, the Conservative chair of the culture select committee, said he had concerns privatisation was “being done for revenge” after Channel 4’s critical coverage of Brexit and Johnson. He also said the potential sale proceeds were “irrelevant” in the scale of the national debt but that he would back a sale if it was part of an overhaul of all public service broadcasting. Jeremy Hunt, a former culture secretary, told Sky News: “I’m not in favour of it because as it stands Channel 4 provides competition to the BBC on what’s called public service broadcasting – the kinds of programmes that are not commercially viable – and I think it would be a shame to lose that.” He said he had never considered privatising it when he was culture secretary. Another Tory who criticised the proposed sale was the father of the house, Peter Bottomley, who said it was “bad for the diversity of television, bad for viewers and bad for independent producers”, adding: “It was considered in the mid-1990s and turned down. It should be rejected now.” The Conservative MPs’ WhatsApp group saw a number of MPs objecting to the sale, saying there was no good reasoning behind it. However, one MP said there were far more either neutral, or backing Dorries, who weighed into the debate to say that one of the reasons for the move was that Channel 4 could not borrow privately. In the House of Lords, the government faced substantial opposition in an emergency question about the issue, particularly around protecting Channel 4’s news output and foreign ownership. Asked by Labour’s Alf Dubs if there would be any safeguard against a foreign media company buying Channel 4, culture minister Stephen Parkinson replied that the government “expected a lot of interest from around the world” in the sale. Former Lib Dem leader Menzies Campbell mocked the comparisons between Channel 4 and streaming services: “Netflix is a complete red herring. How many journalists and how many camera crews has Netflix sent to the Ukraine?”The government hopes to raise about £1bn from the sell-off, making it one of the biggest privatisations since Royal Mail went public a decade ago. Ministers have suggested they could spend the proceeds to boost creative training and independent production companies, essentially funding their levelling up agenda. The plans have provoked a fierce reaction from the media industry, with prominent broadcasters such as Sir David Attenborough suggesting the government was pursuing an agenda of “shortsighted political and financial attacks” on British public service broadcasters. Channel 4’s chief executive, Alex Mahon, told staff of the news in an email on Monday night, saying: “We have been informed in the last hour that the government will shortly announce that the secretary of state has decided to proceed with the proposal to privatise Channel 4.” On Monday evening Dorries tweeted that public ownership was “holding Channel 4 back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon”. She added: “A change of ownership will give Channel 4 the tools and freedom to flourish and thrive as a public service broadcaster long into the future.” The shadow culture secretary, Lucy Powell, described the move as “cultural vandalism”. She said: “Selling off Channel 4, which doesn’t cost the taxpayer a penny anyway, to what is likely to be a foreign company, is cultural vandalism. It will cost jobs and opportunities in the north and Yorkshire, and hit the wider British creative economy.”",News/Media,"Channel 4 privatisation faces parliamentary revolt, senior Tories say",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/05/senior-tories-speak-out-against-channel-4-privatisation-plans
4/6/2022,"The D-day veteran Harry Billinge, who at 18 was one of the first British soldiers to land on Gold beach in 1944, has died the age of 96 after a short illness, his family have said. As a sapper attached to the 44 Royal Engineer Commandos, Billinge was one of only four men from his 10-man unit to survive the landings and subsequent battles in France, later fighting in Caen and the Falaise pocket in Normandy. He settled in Cornwall and went on to raise more than £50,000 for veterans, including for a national memorial honouring his fallen comrades. He was made an MBE in 2019 for charitable fundraising, and he was also awarded France’s highest award, the Légion d’honneur. His daughter, Sally Billinge-Shandley, said: “He was a man that always gave his word, his word was solid. He always fought for what he believed in. The passion he had for all the veterans that lost their lives was unwavering. “How he dedicated his life to making sure that was never forgotten, that’s how he’ll be remembered. The memorial for the Normandy veterans just became part of him; it was just a huge part of his life. Some of his last words were: ‘Love one another.’” On being made an MBE, Billinge told BBC Breakfast: “I’m no hero, I was lucky, I’m here. All the heroes are dead and I’ll never forget them.” A proud cockney, he grew up in Petts Wood in Kent but had been in Cornwall for 70 years. He set up shop as a barber and became president of the local clubs for the Royal British Legion and Royal Engineers. He made annual pilgrimages to the cemeteries of Normandy. A tribute from British Normandy Memorial said: “The trust sends its deepest condolences to Harry’s wife, Sheila, and to all his family and friends.” In 2020 Billinge was “deeply moved” to have a Great Western Railway (GWR) intercity express train named after him to mark 75 years since the end of the war. Mark Hopwood, the GWR managing director, said: “We’re so sad to hear about the passing of our dear friend Harry Billinge MBE. It was our absolute honour to name one of our trains after him in October 2020 and we will never forget the impact he had on so many.” Billinge is survived by his wife, Shelia, to whom he was married for 67 years, two daughters Sally and Margot, son Christopher and granddaughters Amy and Claire.",News/UK news,D-day veteran and fundraiser Harry Billinge dies at 96,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/05/d-day-veteran-and-fundraiser-harry-billinge-dies-aged-96
4/6/2022,"Whatever the rights and wrongs of punishing NHS staff for mistakes (New law means future medical scandals could be missed, says NHS watchdog, 1 April), the government is ignoring a fundamental cause of the dreadful events described in the Ockenden report. Poor staffing can lead to problems such as a lack of listening and empathy, rudeness, mistakes and bullying. Imagine you are constantly rushing between too many labouring women, or “ignoring” a new mother’s buzzer because another is in floods of tears, or trying to monitor several abnormal foetal heart rates simultaneously. Is it surprising that your stress means you don’t listen properly, are unintentionally abrupt, miss something vital and are bullied by your manager, who is also stressed and bullied by theirs? You will be too exhausted, demoralised and scared to blow the whistle. Increased workforce numbers would help. The government has refused to take a vital step here, rejecting an amendment to the health and care bill that would have required it to publish an independent review of NHS workforce requirements every two years. The amendment was backed by Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee, and Simon Stevens, the former NHS England chief executive, but voted down in the Commons last week. The government has just cut £330m from the NHS budget, so of course it doesn’t want the inevitable demand for more money for staff and training that would undoubtedly be recommended in these workforce reviews. Yet £6bn is being spent on more expensive agency staff. So I beg MPs to vote for this amendment when it returns from the Lords.Gay LeeLondon  Avoidable baby and mother deaths are almost certainly not confined to Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust (Police examine 600 cases after damning NHS baby deaths report, 30 March). A factor common to all hospitals was the use of the number of caesarean sections as a negative performance indicator. Clearly, top-down pressure to minimise caesareans might override clinical judgment in individual cases. The use of this performance indicator has been criticised for over a decade, but it was not until February this year that NHS England and NHS Improvement said hospitals should no longer use “total caesarean section rates as a means of performance management” because it may lead to decisions that “may be clinically inappropriate or unsafe in individual cases”. In the time it took these august bodies to arrive at this glaringly obvious conclusion, at least 201 babies and nine mothers died unnecessarily in Shrewsbury and Telford, many because of resistance to performing caesarean sections. These deaths, and many others that have probably occurred at other trusts for the same reason, should be blamed largely on NHS England and, ultimately, successive health secretaries.Geoff RenshawLeamington Spa, Warwickshire  Re Gaby Hinsliff’s article (The horrific birth stories from Shrewsbury NHS trust are haunting.

Mine is the failure of most of broadcast and print media to report the continuing death toll from Covid. This plays into the hands of libertarians who care little about public health, still less about the hugely unequal distribution of those deaths, and fuels the myth that Covid is just another virus that we have to live with. Chiles’s distinction between “interesting” as the basis for what is newsworthy rather than “important” is spot-on. But he omits examples of dogged journalism that do keep a story alive precisely because it is important, such as Amelia Gentleman’s outstanding work on the Windrush scandal. I hope that someone of her calibre takes up the Covid death toll and keeps it in the public eye. Last week it was over 1,000. Covid has definitely not gone away.Alan WalkerProfessor of social policy, University of Sheffield  At last the NHS Covid symptom list has been expanded to include additional ones such as fatigue, sore throat and headache, following the compelling evidence of the Zoe Covid-19 symptom tracker app (Report, 4 April). Zoe has consistently been the country’s most reliable source of information about symptoms and virus prevalence over the entire pandemic, as well as providing an extraordinarily rich basis for future research. The government’s response has been to cancel Zoe’s public funding, presumably on the basis that no news is good news, or perhaps to shoot the messenger. Meanwhile, cases and deaths continue to rise.Marcia HeinemannLondon  It was interesting to read the piece on Covid etiquette, like when to wear a mask, isolate, etc (How to navigate Covid etiquette now England has ended free testing, 1 April), coupled with the excellent article on Omicron myths (30 March).

4/6/2022,"Trevor Bayliss, the World Cup-winning former England head coach, has held talks with Cricket Australia over the vacancy left by Justin Langer’s post-Ashes departure in February. Bayliss, 59, is back at Lord’s this summer and will be reunited with Eoin Morgan, his England white-ball captain, having been named as the interim head coach of London Spirit in the Hundred following the death of Shane Warne last month. But while some have viewed this new role as a sign that Bayliss’s interest in coaching Australia is over, the Guardian understands discussions with CA took place last week as the governing body assesses its options. Andrew McDonald, Langer’s former assistant, is the front-runner to take over, having led the coaching staff during the recent tour of Pakistan that delivered a historic 1-0 Test series win. Though a 2-1 defeat in the one-day international leg of the trip followed, that result is unlikely to diminish his prospects. “[McDonald] is just a great operator,” Pat Cummins, Australia’s Test captain, said in the aftermath of that victory. “The boys absolutely love him. He’s very diligent, very thorough and strategic and organised. He’s a huge part of this tour win. It’s not my place to employ the coach but ‘Ronnie’ has been fantastic.” McDonald, 40, has similarly spoken to CA in the past week but stopped short of declaring his interest publicly when asked about it, revealing there was “no great detail or clarity on what the role would look like’’ during the talks. It appears Australia are still to decide whether the role of head coach should be split by way of Test and white-ball international cricket given the crowded fixture schedule, something the England and Wales Cricket Board is also considering for its men’s set-up once a new managing director is appointed. If so, it may be that Bayliss and McDonald – both known to be popular among the current Australia squad – find roles in a rejigged coaching set-up, with the former’s past success possibly leaning him towards the limited-overs teams.",Sport/Sport,Former England coach Bayliss holds talks with Cricket Australia over role,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/05/former-england-coach-bayliss-holds-talks-with-cricket-australia-over-role
4/6/2022,"The wife of a man killed by his neighbour has criticised the police and other authorities for “toothless and ineffective responses” to repeated warnings that the murderer was dangerous. Can Arslan, who had a deep grudge against his neighbours, stabbed Matthew Boorman, a father of three, 27 times on his victim’s front lawn in the village of Walton Cardiff near Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire on 5 October last year. Boorman’s wife, Sarah, sustained a knife wound to her thigh as she tried to help her husband while another neighbour, Peter Marsden, was stabbed eight times but managed to fend off 52-year-old Arslan and survived. Speaking after a jury at Bristol crown court found Arslan guilty of murder, Sarah Boorman said she would fight to expose the failings of the system. She said: “In the years that preceded Matthew’s death, multiple agencies and authorities were warned of the threat that this man posed not only to Matthew, but to many other neighbours who were threatened and harmed by him. “Although Matthew’s murder has shocked us all to the core, the incident was not remotely out of the blue. The police and other authorities had been told about how dangerous this man was, the threats he made, and the risks he presented. The response was toothless and ineffective, even when the defendant himself told the police he was going to murder Matthew. That conversation took place on the 4 October, the night before Matthew died. He was not even warned. “Matthew was not this man’s only victim on that dreadful evening, but he was the only one with the misfortune to pay the high price of his life. Mistakes were made. They must be acknowledged, truly learned from, and must never be repeated.” Arslan had admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but denied murdering Boorman. The jury heard he had been diagnosed with a paranoid, unstable and antisocial personality disorder but the prosecution argued he was fully in control at the time of the attacks and knew the difference between right and wrong. In her closing speech, Kate Brunner QC said Arslan had plotted a script for a real-life horror story with himself as the killer. “It was something he had planned and controlled. It was a horror movie planned out, where he was going to stab his victims to death one by one. A horror movie where he was going to take a starring role, and end up on the TV,” she said. After his arrest, Arslan asked officers if he was on Sky News or the BBC. Sarah Boorman had told the court that Arslan had repeatedly threatened to murder her, her husband and their children, taunting them that he would only serve 10 years in prison if he did so. The court heard there had been a long-running dispute between Arslan and neighbours, with small arguments over parking and a scratch to a car escalating to the point where Arslan faced eviction. Sarah Boorman said she would never speak Arslan’s name. “Throughout this trial the defendant has revelled in the attention, seeking his moment in the spotlight. He has not shown one flicker of remorse or decency.” The Independent Office of Police Conduct said it was examining what actions Gloucestershire constabulary took in response to a number of reports made by neighbours since January last year. Assistant chief constable Craig Holden said: “We understand what was heard in court raises questions over what was done by police and other agencies before the terrible events. Senior representatives from local agencies have also commissioned an independent, non-statutory partnership review, which will look at how both public and private-sector organisations worked together to address the concerns of Arslan’s neighbours.” Peter Tonge, Tewkesbury borough council’s head of community services, said: “As a local council our powers in these difficult and complex situations are limited, particularly when it involves private housing – we did not have the authority to evict him, nor have the power to instigate eviction proceedings ourselves. “We have been made aware that questions have been raised about the different authorities’ involvement in this case, and clearly we take this seriously. As with all serious cases like these, we will be carrying out a full review of our involvement.” Arslan will be sentenced in June.",News/UK news,Wife of murdered Gloucestershire man criticises police for not heeding warnings,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/05/man-found-guilty-murdering-neighbour-front-lawn-gloucestershire-can-arslan-matthew-boorman
4/6/2022,"A prominent Nigerian humanist has been sentenced to 24 years in prison after pleading guilty to blasphemy charges, in a landmark case that has put a new focus on the threats to freedom of expression in the west African country. Mubarak Bala, the president of the Humanist Association of Nigeria, was sentenced on Tuesday afternoon, two years after his arrest at his home in the northern Kaduna state on 28 April 2020. He was then taken to neighbouring Kano, where calls for action against him had been made by members of the religious establishment in the majority Muslim and conservative state. Bala, the son of a religious scholar in Kano, is an atheist who had been an outspoken religious critic in a staunchly conservative region. He faced death threats and calls for him to be tried for blasphemy after he posted comments critical of Islam on Facebook in April 2020. In court on Tuesday, to the surprise of his legal team, Bala requested to change his plea to guilty, one of his lawyers said. “Just suddenly, he changed his plea and pleaded guilty to the whole 18-count charges … We were in shock.” The lawyer said Bala might have seen the guilty plea as a way to end the case. “It feels like he felt he should just know his fate. He didn’t know when this would come to an end. He may have thought a guilty plea would lead to some leniency but the judgment was harsh,” he said. Leo Igwe, an associate of Bala’s and founder of the Humanist Association of Nigeria, said following the case: “Unfortunately this is a very sad day for humanism and for human rights in Nigeria. The implication is not good for the humanist movement, because it means that humanists will be, by implication, criminal.” Bala’s detention and treatment has been condemned by Humanists UK and UN human rights experts. Bala was detained without charge for a year, during which his whereabouts were unknown and he was denied contact with his lawyer or family for months. A high court in the capital, Abuja, ordered his release on bail but the ruling was ignored by Nigerian authorities in Kano and Kaduna. His case has been seen as an example of a clampdown on voices judged to be critical of religious orthodoxy, in a deeply conservative region. Bala had previously been forcibly committed into a psychiatric facility by his family in Kano, after he renounced Islam in 2014. Following Bala’s sentence, Igwe claimed that members of the religious establishment had likely threatened Bala to admit guilt. “He was under pressure to admit he was guilty and that otherwise he could die in prison. It was impressed on him by authorities in Kano that the only way his family could be safe was if he admitted that he was guilty, so even against legal advice he decided to agree and face the consequences.”",News/World news,Nigerian humanist jailed for 24 years after pleading guilty to blasphemy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/nigerian-humanist-mubarak-bala-receives-24-year-jail-sentence
4/6/2022,"Satellite images showing bodies strewn across the streets of Bucha have provided a rebuttal to claims by the Russian state that Ukrainian forces placed dead people in the town in “staged provocation” after Russian forces had already withdrawn. The corpses’ positions on the photos, taken in mid-March, match those from smartphone pictures published in early April, allowing the massacre to be precisely dated to before Russian forces evacuated the town. The analysis of the images, published by the New York Times, is the latest example of the growing importance of satellite imagery to reporters, researchers and activists seeking to document the progression of the war in Ukraine and gather evidence of war crimes in the region. Along with cheap and accessible drone footage, the technology has revolutionised the practice of “open-source intelligence”, or OSINT, says Eliot Higgins, founder of OSINT journalism group Bellingcat. “Syria was where everyone learned the value of satellite imagery when it came to this kind of stuff,” Higgins says. “But now, thanks to the work of companies like Planet Labs, we’re in a position where we can even task satellites a few times a month to certain locations. Lots of people are doing that at the moment, and they’re all focused on Ukraine, so what we’re getting is lots and lots of good resolution satellite imagery from all over the country. “Often that’s accessible to people within hours. So you hear a report and, within a few hours, if you’re lucky and the clouds are good enough, you can get a nice high-resolution image of what you’re looking at.” Many of the skills applied in documenting the Ukrainian battlefield were honed in investigations such as Bellingcat’s examination of the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 by Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014, and similar efforts documenting war crimes in the Syrian civil war. Matching an area of satellite footage with a single picture posted on social media is no mean feat, but the best OSINT investigators have developed an almost uncanny ability to find locations. In the early days, though, researchers were limited by the satellite footage posted to Google Earth, which was often years out of date. Now, as imagery providers have got more used to custom from media and activists, they are eager to provide useful pictures. But while satellite imagery is more widely available, and more responsive, the actual pictures have not changed. Consumer use of satellite imagery is legally capped at a resolution of 0.25 metre pixels (one-sixteenth of a square metre) regardless of the capability of the cameras in space; this has been so since 2014. “There’s better resolution imagery, we’re just not allowed to use it,” Higgins says. The world’s militaries, of course, have no such limits – as was conclusively proved in 2019 when Donald Trump tweeted out a classified image of an Iranian missile launchpad in ultra-high-res.",News/World news,Satellite images of corpses in Bucha contradict Russian claims,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/satellite-images-of-corpses-in-bucha-prove-russian-claims-wrong
4/6/2022,"Ministers have been accused of waging a “woke war” after a key LGBT+ government adviser quit over plans to exclude transgender people from a long-awaited ban on conversion practices. Iain Anderson said he was “completely shocked” by the decision and suggested Downing Street appeared to be “trying to drive a wedge” between those who are gay or bisexual and those who are transgender. After more than 100 organisations pulled out of the government’s international conference on LGBT+ rights, Anderson said the event should not take place, admitting: “Trust has been eroded.” Anderson added that he had taken the advisory job “on the basis there’d be a policy for everyone in the LGBT community, but apparently that’s not going to happen.” The move will come as a further blow to Boris Johnson, who faced a backlash from Tory MPs after last week’s decision not to pursue the ban on conversion “therapy”. A partial U-turn came hours later, but Downing Street only committed to cracking down on conversion practices for those questioning their sexuality, not their gender. Anderson told ITV News: “Britain needs a strategy for trans people and I can’t see one at the moment. We have a tabloid debate going on about people’s lives. It’s not a respectful debate; it’s turned into a woke war. It’s turned into a wedge issue … I was LGBT business champion, not LGB or T, and that’s why I’m walking away. “I feel what the government is doing is trying to create a wedge between LGB people and trans people. I think it’s the wrong approach and I disagree with the policy.” Members of the trans community are reeling from the decision, with some considering leaving the UK. “Every single trans person I speak to, without exception, is incredibly demoralised,” said Katy Montgomerie, an activist and YouTuber, who said she had recently applied for a gender recognition certificate “just in case I have to leave the country”. She said: “People message me every day saying ‘I can’t stop crying, can you give me some hope?’ Do I have to call ahead to pubs now to see if I can use the toilet? It’s disgusting and there doesn’t seem to be an end in sight. It’s horrific to be told you are a second-class citizen.” In his resignation letter, Anderson told Johnson that conversion practices were abhorrent and said it was “deeply damaging” that the government had briefed that trans people would be excluded from future legislation. The news came a day after the Conservative backbencher Jamie Wallis became the UK’s first openly trans MP. Wallis said he was “bitterly disappointed” at the government’s backtracking, saying that it “cannot be described as anything other than a broken promise”. Jennie Kermode, a film-maker and the secretary of Trans Media Watch, said: “There had been some hope around Jamie Wallis coming out last week, and the possibility of more trans people in parliament, but the past few days have been extreme. “Trans people are feeling hurt, scared and threatened and some are talking about leaving the UK. But we are also feeling buoyed up by the support we’ve received from the wider LGBT community and allies.” A senior government source said the issue had now turned into a “complete mess”. They said there would probably be “a fight in the Commons” from those Tory MPs who may propose amendments to widen the ban. More organisations announced on Tuesday that they were pulling out of the government’s LGBT+ conference, Safe To Be Me, which was scheduled to take place in a matter of months. The Trades Union Congress said it was “deeply concerned” at the government’s decision, adding that it “shows that the government does not prioritise inclusion and safety for all LGBT+ people”. The Unison union said the government had made a despicable U-turn and it constituted “another attack on trans right by the Conservatives”.",News/Society,LGBT government adviser quits over conversion practices U‑turn,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/05/lgbt-government-adviser-quits-over-conversion-practices-uturn
4/6/2022,"The chair of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, Alex Wurz, has put F1 on notice that its drivers will no longer stay silent on issues such as where the sport races after they considered boycotting the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. The GPDA represents the 20 F1 drivers and the controversy in Saudi Arabia was, for Wurz, indicative of the sea change in the attitude of his members and across sport as a whole that has taken place recently. “We can see that sport has undergone a very swift change over the last few years,” he said. “It really came to the surface with the issue of racism and with Black Lives Matter. Before, drivers were seen as sportspeople where the position was: ‘I am a sportsperson, I am not getting involved in politics.’ That time has really gone. “In the last two to three years those young people have suddenly come to the position that they should have an opinion and that they should also talk and express their opinions and deal with their responsibility for it.” The Saudi GP was already a source of unease for drivers because of the state’s terrible human rights record. Then, a missile strike within six miles of the Jeddah circuit on the Friday before the race led to the drivers agreeing the race should be cancelled. They were ultimately placated but are expected to meet with F1 during or shortly after this weekend’s Australian GP to air their concerns about racing in Saudi Arabia. F1’s owners, who have the commercial rights to the sport and decide the calendar, are not going to cancel the hugely lucrative Saudi Arabian GP but that the drivers will require more input into how the sport is run now appears inevitable. F1 is invested in selling them as the stars of the show, a marketing tool that has worked well, however with it comes an emboldened generation who are aware of the potential power they wield. Wurz admired the way they acted collectively in Saudi Arabia but was not surprised that they did so. “It’s definitely very impressive to watch that they strongly came together,” he said. “As they did so over the last few years, but now it is demanded of athletes. The transformation of young people taking this responsibility is impressive. “We are talking about people who are dedicated to a professional life and they are going out and informing themselves and forming their opinions.”",Sport/Sport,"F1 will continue to speak out after Saudi chaos, says Drivers’ Association chair",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/05/f1-drivers-will-continue-to-speak-out-says-drivers-association-chair

According to the Hollywood Reporter, Azadeh Masihzadeh brought the case after Farhadi had earlier sued her for defamation; in both cases the courts ruled in Masihzadeh’s favour. In 2014, Masihzadeh made a short documentary for a workshop led by Farhadi, about a real-life inmate of a debtors’ prison, who found and returned a bag of gold while on leave at the prison. Masihzadeh’s film was called All Winners, All Losers, and showed at a film festival in the Iranian city of Shiraz in 2018. Farhadi’s film A Hero, which stars Amir Jadidi as a debtors’ prison inmate who finds and returns a bag of gold, screened at the Cannes film festival in 2021 and won the second place grand prix; its script is credited to Farhadi alone. Masihzadeh told the Hollywood Reporter that Farhadi had pressured her into signing a document handing rights to the story over to him without payment. Farhadi claimed through his lawyer that the main idea for his film came much earlier, and he was inspired by the Bertolt Brecht play Life of Galileo. Farhadi’s claim for defamation against Masihzadeh was dismissed after the court found there was insufficient evidence to suggest Masihzadeh was deliberately trying to damage the director’s reputation. The subsequent plagiarism suit also went Masihzadeh’s way, after Farhadi claimed he had independently researched the story and did not credit her on A Hero.

4/6/2022,"The European Commission has launched the bloc’s new rule-of-law disciplinary procedure for the first time against Hungary, two days after nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, won a fourth landslide victory in parliamentary elections. Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, told the European parliament on Tuesday that Budapest had been informed of the decision and “we will now send the letter of formal notification to start the conditionality mechanism”. The untested mechanism, designed to prevent EU funds from being misused by countries backsliding on the rule of law, was agreed by all 27 EU leaders in late 2020 and could ultimately deprive Budapest of more than €40bn of EU payments. “It’s happening. Finally!” tweeted the German Green MEP Daniel Freund, a vocal critic of Orbán and of the commission’s reluctance to act on his democratic backsliding. Von de Leyen in particular had been accused of dragging her feet on the issue. The move followed shock in Brussels after Orbán hit out at “opponents” – including “Brussels bureaucrats” but also Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy – in his victory speech, hours after horrific images emerged of atrocities in Bucha, near Kyiv. Few in the EU offered their congratulations after the Hungarian prime minister’s win, which followed years of criticism he was undercutting liberal democratic rights and values, and accusations that he was using funds from the bloc to enrich his associates. The Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, however, offered his congratulations to Orbán, a long-term Kremlin ally, on Monday, saying the “further development of a bilateral partnership fully accords to the interests of the peoples of Russia and Hungary”. Prominent anti-EU politicians including Britain’s Nigel Farage, France’s Marine Le Pen and Italy’s Matteo Salvini were also quick to congratulate Orbán. “When the people vote, the people win,” tweeted Le Pen. Even if it takes time to finalise internal work on the sanction, critics of the Orbán regime have said the commission’s decision alone could have a rapid impact, making it harder for Budapest to borrow money, for example. Orbán, in power since 2010, has tightened the noose around academics, NGOs and the media, as well as restricting the freedoms of migrants and gay people. There have also been multiple allegations of EU funds being diverted to Orbán’s friends and family. The European court of justice last month dismissed complaints about the mechanism from Hungary and Poland, whose ruling Law and Justice party is in a long-running battle with Brussels over judicial independence, increasing pressure on the commission to act. In a milestone in the battle for the rule of law in the EU, the bloc’s highest court rejected the countries’ cases “in their entirety”, confirming that EU member states can be deprived of EU funds when they fail to meet democratic standards. The EU’s values, such as the rule of law, “define the very identity of the European Union as a legal order”, the court said. “Compliance with those values cannot be reduced to an obligation which a candidate state must meet in order to accede to the European Union and which it may disregard after accession.” The law is intended to protect from fraud against the EU budget, rather than all rule-of-law violations. It won strong backing from governments in western Europe that are net payers into the EU budget. But it was criticised by Hungary and Poland, both net recipients of EU funds, who have received billions of euros since joining the bloc in 2004 to improve public infrastructure, fund universities and support farmers.",News/World news,European Commission launches rule-of-law disciplinary procedure against Hungary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/european-commission-launches-rule-of-law-disciplinary-procedure-against-hungary
4/6/2022,"Apolicy of indifference to the plight of Ukrainian refugees would be morally repugnant, but honest. Millions fleeing the criminal butchery of Vladimir Putin’s army would be told that they were not welcome in Britain and should seek sanctuary elsewhere. That is not the UK government line. Instead, something more insidious has taken shape – a device for mixing the desperation of displaced people with hospitality offered by the British public, and feeding both into a bureaucratic mangle so every drop of uncertainty and dread can be wrung out. That is the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Making pain from generosity is an innovation in nastiness that no single Whitehall department could achieve. It takes a special failure of collaboration involving Michael Gove’s Levelling Up department, Priti Patel’s Home Office and the special ingredient – Boris Johnson’s delinquent inattention to detail. The scheme was launched on 14 March after Downing Street realised that public opinion was appalled by the absence of a fast track for Ukrainian refugees. Gove told MPs that British people, having “opened their hearts”, would also “open their homes”. But Patel held the keys. By the end of the month, 32,200 applications had been made, and only 4,700 visas issued. Those numbers describe the contours of a bottleneck. They cannot convey what happens inside the bottle, the desperate lives pressed against its glass edges, the slow suffocation of promises, the frightened look back at scenes of cold-blooded massacre and other atrocities in a homeland under threat of genocide. About 4.2 million refugees have fled Ukraine, with a further 6.5 million internally displaced. One is supposed to be staying with my family in Brighton. We made contact via friends of friends. As sponsors, we helped apply for a visa. The case is now suspended in an administrative void with thousands of others. Just to reach that stage requires navigating an online system that could be the hardest level in a Kafka-themed video game. And you need a computer and a stable internet connection, which are not always available to refugees. We send what reassurance we can into the blackout, to faces made pale by the light of a phone screen and by fear of Russian missiles. What to say? There is a good news story about the system as it is meant to work. Then there is reality, gleaned from conversations with MPs, charities, local government and Whitehall officials. There are delays at every junction. Documents uploaded online seem not to be appearing in the UK visa service database. Those applications aren’t even in limbo. They are in the antechamber before limbo. Once across the threshold they enter the “hostile environment” – the notorious Home Office apparatus for limiting numbers of people entering Britain. I am assured that this machine is being repurposed to maximise permissions for Ukrainians, but the infrastructure of rejection is not easily reassembled. The department’s watchword is security, which means presuming that anyone crossing the border without a British passport is up to no good – fraud, espionage, terrorism. Visas can only be issued once the relevant checks are carried out using a limited number of specialised computers. It all takes time. Desperate mothers and traumatised children are not above suspicion. The default to mistrust is hardly new. Fear of admitting jihadist interlopers stalks the processing of Syrian and Afghan asylum claims. Even in the second world war, some Jewish refugees from the Third Reich were interned in British prisons because they were citizens of Germany or Austria. The extreme unlikelihood of Jews harbouring secret allegiance to Hitler was not taken into account. Meanwhile, the rest of Whitehall is grappling with the fierce complexity of an open-ended refugee settlement programme that was just a website when Gove declared it open. British sponsors finding their own matches with Ukrainian refugees is just phase one. The scheme will then be expanded “rapidly” to include charities, churches and community groups. That upscaling process is happening mostly in circumvention of the Home Office, deemed more an obstacle than a partner. Mobilising the goodwill and spare rooms of the British public was a neat idea in theory that gets untidy on inspection of practicalities. The task falls mostly to local councils, which have to worry about host suitability, standards of accommodation, school places for children who might also need support for trauma. There will be pressure on services that are already rationed by budget cuts. Refugee charities worry about what happens to new arrivals whose sponsors are disqualified or pull out. What happens when support payments for hosts expire after six months? Already there is a problem of bogus sponsorship by human traffickers and other predators using the government’s vague promise of welcome as cover to harvest victims for exploitation. Such are the gaps in ministerial thinking that civil servants, councillors and voluntary groups are frantically trying to plug. Privately, they say the scheme is more gap than substance – a Potemkin policy launched to dispel bad headlines, with nothing behind it. “Not thought-through” is the phrase I keep hearing. In other words, the policy for Ukrainian refugees is exactly like every other policy of Johnson’s government. There was a moment of political urgency, a humanitarian crisis that stirred the nation’s conscience. Alarm bells rang in Downing Street, where public opinion must serve as proxy for conscience. The prime minister wanted the ringing to stop. A plan was hatched; not so much a plan as an idea. Barely an idea; a slogan: “Homes for Ukraine”. Then someone has to deliver the plan. The rhetoric must somehow be lifted off the page, propped up in three dimensions, spread across departments, filled with resources. By then the news caravan has moved on and Downing Street’s focus is elsewhere. Johnson is clearly enjoying his status as a friend of Ukraine. The emergency has lifted his spirits by relegating domestic scandal down the news running order. But the prime minister’s friendships are always lopsided. He is interested in the rugged soldierly face of war and the new-edition “Boris” action figure in khaki. The complex long-term needs of refugees are less his thing. They can be someone else’s problem, which he sees as a problem solved. Except these are people’s lives, their hopes. The pledges that have been made to them come not from ministers but from ordinary citizens who are trying to do a decent thing and thought, naively, that the government could help. Now they feel like accomplices in a grotesque hoax of unfathomable cruelty. It is not news that Johnson lets people down. It is one of the constants of his career. Everyone is betrayed in the end. But, with help from an incompetent cabinet, he has outdone himself with the offer to make Britain a place of sanctuary to Ukrainian refugees. Having run out of his own pledges to break, he has stooped to purloining promises from the public and breaking those too.

4/6/2022,"Throughout the 1960s, musicians and record producers puzzled over the precise formula used to create the Motown sound. Was it some special property of the microphones, or the way the snare drum was tuned, or even the kind of carpeting used in the company’s Detroit studio? One vital factor was overlooked, because its presence was almost subliminal: the rhythm guitar playing of Joe Messina, who has died aged 93. A jazz-trained musician, Messina often did little more on a Motown record than play a chord on every backbeat, the second and fourth beats of each bar. But those downstrokes added a certain thickness and tone to beats already being given their weight by the snare drum and their cutting edge by a tambourine. The result was the kind of dancefloor propulsion heard on Martha and the Vandellas’ Dancing in the Street, the Miracles’ Going to a Go-Go, the Four Tops’ I Can’t Help Myself and Temptations’ (I Know) I’m Losing You, the sort of hits that would give Motown a vast international following. Long unknown by name or face to those who bought and danced to the million-selling records on which they played, the Motown session men finally made it into the public eye in 2002, when the award-winning documentary film Standing in the Shadows of Motown revealed their role. The film’s popularity resulted in live reunions that included shows at the Apollo theatre in Harlem, the Royal Festival Hall in London, the opening ceremony for the 2004 Ryder Cup golf tournament at Oakland Hills, just outside Detroit, and the White House, where they were hosted by President George W Bush. Many were surprised to see a white guitarist among the ranks of the Motown musicians. In the days when he sat between his fellow guitarists Robert White and Eddie Willis, both African Americans, churning out one hit after another in Motown’s Studio A, he liked to refer to himself, in the sort of joke that probably could not be made today, as “the cream in the Oreo cookie”. Born to Mary and Jasper Messina in Detroit, Joe attended the city’s Central high school and studied music at Cass Tech, the alma mater of many celebrated jazz musicians, before dropping out to pursue a professional career. From the late 1940s he played in Detroit’s jazz clubs and eventually landed a job with the band on the comedian Soupy Sales’ popular nightly TV show, broadcast nationally from a studio in midtown Detroit. A student of bebop, he was proud of playing with Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Milt Jackson, among other visiting stars. At the beginning of the 60s, with the Motown sound in its infancy, Berry Gordy Jr, the company’s founder and president, assembled a cadre of skilled musicians who could be put on salary, guaranteeing their loyalty and their permanent availability for sessions run according to an around-the-clock schedule inspired by Detroit’s automobile production lines. Mickey Stevenson, Gordy’s head of A&R, recommended Messina, who soon found himself among musicians of the calibre of the drummer Benny Benjamin, the bassist James Jamerson, the keyboards players Earl Van Dyke, Joe Hunter and Johnny Griffith, the vibraphone and tambourine exponent Jack Ashford, and the percussionist Eddie “Bongo” Brown. Known to themselves as the Funk Brothers, they worked day after day in the studio they called the Snakepit. Producers and songwriters such as Stevenson, Smokey Robinson, Lamont Dozier and the brothers Eddie and Brian Holland would often arrive with nothing more than a snatch of melody and hum it to the musicians, who would come up with the framework – the introduction, the background riffs, the turnarounds – that transformed those fragments into gold records. None of the musicians would receive a penny in royalties for their contributions to records still being played six decades later. Although the three guitarists were all well-rounded players, each had his own speciality. White thumb-picked lyrical intros, Willis added a hint of the blues to the riffs, and Messina hit the backbeat with a plectrum on his customised guitar: a Fender Telecaster with a Jazzmaster neck, strung with heavy-gauge flatwound strings to emphasise the percussive effect. When Gordy moved the company to Hollywood in 1972, planning to continue making records there while breaking into the movie business, he left almost all his stalwart session musicians behind, many of them stranded without a regular income. Messina put down his guitar to concentrate on his investment in a car-wash business. Not until 2000, when the guitarist Allan Slutsky began approaching the old Motown musicians with the idea that eventually turned into the documentary, did he begin playing seriously again. In 2013 the surviving Funk Brothers gathered for the unveiling of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: a somewhat ironic accolade, given that Gordy’s Sunset Boulevard dreams had put an end to their work together. His wife, Josie, died in 2009; although a wheelchair user, she had accompanied him to all the Funk Brothers’ reunion gigs. He is survived by their son, Joel, their daughter, Janice, four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

4/6/2022,"Archival footage has been found of the singer Prince at a teachers’ strike in 1970 when he was just 11. The video was first discovered by WCCO, a CBS News affiliate in Minnesota, and shows film of an April 1970 teachers’ strike. WCCO restored the 1970 strike footage to give more context for a strike that took place last month in Minneapolis. When the affiliate’s production manager, Matt Liddy, a Minneapolis native, heard about it, he was curious to see it for himself. “I grew up in Minneapolis, so all I cared about was looking at cool old buildings from the place I grew up. Did I recognize my old school? Did I recognize any landmarks?” said Liddy in an interview with WCCO. While watching the footage, Liddy noticed a reporter interviewing children, and was particularly struck by one child. “I immediately just went out to the newsroom and started showing people, and saying, ‘I’m not gonna tell you who I think this is, but who do you think this is?’ And every single person [said]: Prince,” said Liddy. Although WCCO did not have the appropriate technology to hear the sound on the video, a specialist was able to extract audio, revealing what the younger Prince said. “I think they should get a better education too, because, um … I think they should get some more money ’cause they work, they be working extra hours for us and all that stuff,” said Prince, who at the time would have been known by his full birth name, Prince Rogers Nelson. Prince was not asked for his name in the footage, so WCCO had to find other sources who could verify his identity. Accompanying Prince was a boy who introduced himself as Ronnie Kitchen, but WCCO could not track him down. Prince’s fifth-grade yearbook photos, which WCCO unearthed, did not help either. So WCCO asked historian Kristen Zschomler, who specializes in Twin Cities property and landmarks and happens to be an avid Prince fan. Zschomler confirmed the identification, based on a picture she had of him in sixth grade. She also noted that the school in the background of the restored video was Lincoln junior high school, which Prince attended at the time. Zschomler also found friends of Prince who knew him as a child, including Terrance Jackson, who was in Prince’s first band, Grand Central, when the two were teenagers. “That is Prince! Standing right there with the hat on, right? That’s Skipper! Oh my God,” said Jackson on viewing the footage. “It’s just amazing to see him, that small, that young, and hear his voice,” said Jackson’s wife, Rhoda, who grew up alongside Prince and Terrance. “That’s Prince, AKA Skipper to the Northside.” Prince was one of the most successful pop musicians of all time. He died in 2016, having sold more than 150m albums, written at least 500 published songs and won most major international music awards.",News/US news,"Rare footage discovered of Prince, 11, at 1970 Minneapolis teachers’ strike",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/05/prince-1970-footage-minnesota-teachers-strike
4/6/2022,"The death of a young Jewish man in Bobigny, north of Paris, has shocked France and sparked outrage among French presidential candidates, who seized on it to denounce criminality and a possible antisemitic attack. Jérémy Cohen, 31, was killed when he was hit by a tram in Bobigny in February, which was initially reported in local media as a traffic accident. But when his family leafleted the area to see if local people had more information on what had happened, a witness came forward with video footage, which circulated online this week. Cohen, who had a disability, was surrounded by a group of men and attacked. As he escaped, he was hit by the tram and died shortly afterwards in hospital. After Cohen’s family spoke to Radio Shalom about the case, presidential candidates used the death to suggest the French authorities were not doing enough on the case or on crime in general, days before the first round of the presidential election. The former TV pundit and far-right, anti-immigration candidate, Éric Zemmour, was the first politician to raise the case on social media, asking if Cohen had died because of the violence of a group of thugs. “Did he die because he is Jewish?” Zemmour asked. “Why has this affair been covered up?” Zemmour wrote a magazine article arguing that the case showed the “poisoned cocktail of contemporary France”, from what he called a lax justice system and young thugs with no care for human life. He said French authorities permanently lied to cover up crime by immigrants. Zemmour said in a TV interview that he was shocked by the crime and wanted to restore “peace” to France. On a visit to Brittany on Tuesday as part of his re-election campaign, the president, Emmanuel Macron, said: “I want to express my solidarity with Jérémy Cohen’s family”. He said the video had “shaken” everyone, and the justice system must bring “complete clarity on the situation” and must find answers “as swiftly as possible”. Macron’s office had contacted the Cohen family to express “compassion” and concern. The far-right’s Marine Le Pen – who polls show is likely to go through to a second-round runoff against Macron on 10 April – told French radio there must be a parliamentary inquiry over whether authorities deliberately covered up the case. Cohen’s brother told Radio Shalom, that his kippah, or traditional Jewish cap, had been found on the ground at the scene, emphasising that he did not know if he was wearing it at the time of the attack. The family’s lawyer, Franck Serfati, told RMC radio on Tuesday that at this stage there was no “tangible proof” of an antisemitic attack and the investigation was continuing. Serfati said: “The question to be answered is: was Jérémy wearing the kippah? Was it hidden? Did his attackers target him because he was Jewish?” He said it was up to the justice system to determine this. Serfati said that, as a lawyer, he did not want the case to be a focal point for politicians. “I am only looking for the truth from the justice system, to identify and arrest the attackers and for them to face justice.” Eric Mathais, the state prosecutor in Bobigny, confirmed that an investigation had been opened into the violent attack. “The hypothesis that the victim had crossed the tram tracks to escape his attacks was naturally taken into account,” he said. In a press conference on Tuesday, the Bobigny prosecutor said there was no certainty at this stage of the investigation that there were “discriminatory” motives behind the attack or that the victim was wearing a kippah at the time. He said more witnesses would be interviewed.",News/News,French presidential rivals seize on death of Jewish man as ‘antisemitic attack’,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/05/french-politicians-denounce-death-of-jewish-man-in-possible-antisemitic-attack
4/6/2022,"The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, has announced hate crime charges relating to assaults against seven Asian American women in New York City in February. Steven Zajonc, 28, has been charged in New York state supreme court with six felony counts of assault in the third degree as a hate crime and seven counts of aggravated harassment in the second degree as a misdemeanor hate crime. On 27 February, it is alleged, Zajonc punched, shoved and elbowed seven Asian women in Manhattan without provocation. The first attack occurred at 6.30pm in midtown, when a 57-year-old Asian woman was punched in the face. The woman suffered swelling to her left cheek and a cut lip, authorities said. Zajonc is alleged to have approached a 25-year-old Asian woman near Fifth Avenue and East 30th Street 10 minutes later, hitting her in the face and the back of the arm. He is alleged to have repeated the pattern several times over the next hour, hitting young Asian women – aged 21, 25, 19 and 25 – in the face, shoving another woman, aged 20, to the ground near Broadway and East 8th Street, then fleeing westward. Zajonc was arrested a few days later outside a library in midtown Manhattan, after two security guards recognized him from surveillance videos. “These attacks on seven New York women, each fueled by anti-Asian hate, are yet another sobering reminder of the demonstrable fears AAPI [Asian American and Pacific Islander] communities, particularly AAPI women, in our city continue to face,” Bragg said. “This indictment is a result of our collaboration with the NYPD’s Hate Crimes Task Force and, critically, assistance from the brave witnesses and victims who came forward to stand up against hate. My office is a safe place to report crimes regardless of your immigration status.” Six of the victims suffered injuries, among them bleeding lacerations and facial bruising. Another was knocked unconscious and treated for concussion. The Manhattan DA’s office has 27 open hate crime cases related to anti-Asian hate crimes. Across the US, anti-AAPI hate crime was up 339% last year. Last August, Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition that tracks and responds to racially motivated hate crimes, said more than 9,000 anti-Asian incidents had been reported since March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic spread to the US from China. New York City has seen an alarming rise in violence against Asian Americans. Four have died. They were: GuiYing Ma, 62, who was attacked by a man with a rock in Queens; Yao Pan Ma, 61, who was attacked while collecting cans in East Harlem; Michelle Go, 40, who was pushed on to subway tracks at Times Square; and Christina Yuna Lee, 35, who was stabbed 40 times in her Chinatown apartment.",News/World news,New York man charged with hate crimes for attacks on seven Asian American women,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/new-york-man-charged-hate-crimes-attacks-seven-asian-american-women
4/6/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has given the UN security council a harrowing account of atrocities in his country and demanded that Russian leaders be “brought to justice for war crimes”. A day after Joe Biden called for Putin to be held to account, Zelenskiy said there should be an international tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials of Nazis after the second world war. There has been global revulsion at apparently deliberate civilian killings by Russian troops in Ukraine. Zelenskiy visited the town of Bucha on Monday after officials said the bodies of 410 civilians had been recovered from Kyiv-area towns after Russian troops withdrew. “There is not a single crime that they would not commit there,” Zelenskiy said via video link and an interpreter. “The Russians searched for and purposely killed anyone who served our country. They shot and killed women outside their houses. They killed entire families – adults and children – and they tried to burn the bodies.” Zelenskiy spoke of civilians “shot and killed in the back of the head after being tortured. Some of them were shot on the streets; others were thrown into the wells. So they died there in suffering.” He added: “Civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road just for their pleasure.” The president detailed the alleged brutality of the Russian forces. “They cut off limbs, slashed their throats, women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear.” This was no different, he said, from the behaviour of Islamic State, the terrorist group notorious for its acts of cruelty in Iraq and Syria, but in this instance the perpetrator was Russia, a member of the UN security council. He urged the council to live up to its name. “It is obvious that the key institution of the world which must ensure the coercion of any aggressor to peace simply cannot work effectively.” Zelenskiy also said Bucha was “only one of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for the past 41 days” and there were many more that the world had yet to learn the full truth about. He accused Russia of behaving like an ancient coloniser that was abducting children and looting wealth, including gold earrings ripped from civilians’ ears. “Russia wants to turn Ukraine into silent slaves,” he said. Zelenskiy added: “The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice immediately for war crimes in Ukraine. Anyone who has given criminal orders and carried them out by killing our people will be brought before the tribunal, which should be similar to the Nuremberg tribunal.” He reminded Russian diplomats that Joachim von Ribbentrop, the foreign affairs minister in Nazi Germany, had “not escaped punishment for crimes in world war two”. Von Ribbentrop was executed in 1946. After a brief technical glitch, Zelinskiy played a shocking video that displayed corpses, some charred or dismembered, some lying in streets or mass graves, some belonging to children, followed by the simple message: “#StopRussianAggression.” Earlier the UN human rights office spokesperson Liz Throssell said “all the signs are” that civilians were “directly targeted and directly killed” in Bucha. “This is extremely disturbing,” she said. “And what we must stress is that under international humanitarian law, the deliberate killing of civilians is a war crime.” Zelenskiy conceded in a TV interview that negotiations with Russia, which were reportedly continuing on Tuesday by video link, remained the only option. But he said talks were now a “challenge” after the killings, adding that it was possible he and Putin would not personally hold talks. Images of the corpses of what appear to be civilians shot at close range in the streets of Bucha have prompted international condemnation of Moscow, calls for yet harsher sanctions and demands that those responsible be tried for war crimes. Russia has denied responsibility, suggesting the images are fake or the deaths occurred after Russian forces pulled out. However, satellite photographs taken before the withdrawal show bodies in some of the same places they were later found. Responding to Zelenskiy‘s address, Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Council: “We’ve heard once again a huge amount of lies about Russian soldiers and military.” Russia’s defence ministry claimed similarly staged “events” had also been “organised by Ukrainian special forces in Sumy, Konotop, and other cities”, while the parliamentary speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said Bucha was “a provocation”, with “Washington and Brussels the screenwriters and directors and Kyiv the actors.” However, Maxar Technologies satellite imagery of one Bucha street from 19 and 21 March appears to show several bodies in exactly the same position as in video footage and photos taken this weekend in the same street. A New York Times analysis of closeups of Bucha’s Yablonska Street concluded, after comparing them with video footage from 1 and 2 April, that many corpses had been there since at least three weeks ago, when Russian forces were in control of the town. Britain’s UN ambassador, Barbara Woodward, called the images from Bucha “harrowing, appalling, probable evidence of war crimes and possibly a genocide” and said the security council needed “to think about how we deal with that”. Speaking before he headed to Brussels for meetings of Nato and G7 foreign ministers, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said: “What we’ve seen in Bucha is not the random act of a rogue unit. It’s a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities. The reports are more than credible. The evidence is there for the world to see. This reinforces our determination and the determination of countries around the world to make sure that one way or another, one day or another, there is accountability for those who committed these acts, for those who ordered them.” Peskov said remarks by Biden on Monday calling Putin “a war criminal” and demanding “a war crimes trial” were unacceptable and unworthy of a US president. The White House has also promised fresh sanctions on Moscow this week, and the US is seeking Russia’s suspension from the UN’s human rights council. As Spain, Italy, Sweden and Denmark joined France and Germany in expelling dozens of Russian diplomats, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, on Tuesday outlined the bloc’s fifth package of sanctions, saying Moscow was waging a “cruel, ruthless war, also against Ukraine’s civilian population”. The EU would impose an import ban on coal from Russia, a full transaction ban on key Russian banks, a ban on Russian vessels accessing EU ports, and a ban on Russian and Belarusian road transport operators, among other measures, she said. The EU sanctions did not include cutting off Russian oil and gas imports. Russia supplies about a third of Europe’s gas and several EU countries are still reluctant to impose measures that could touch off a European energy crisis, despite Putin’s efforts to use energy as a lever to fight back against western sanctions. Europe’s worst conflict in decades, which began with Russia’s invasion on 24 February, has killed 20,000 people, according to Ukrainian estimates.

4/6/2022,"Rishi Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murthy, have donated more than £100,000 to the chancellor’s old private school, Winchester college. The private boys’ boarding school, which costs £43,335 a year to attend, revealed the donation in its annual journal. A spokesperson for Sunak said: “Rishi and his wife have donated to numerous charities and philanthropic causes for many years and will continue to do so. These donations are made to help fund scholarships for children who would not otherwise have the opportunity to go to Winchester.” The school’s journal from 2020 also put him in the list of benefactors who have donated more than £100,000 in total, suggesting he has been a regular donor. Speaking of his private education at Winchester, where he was head boy, Sunak told Sky last month: “I was really lucky to have that opportunity. It was something that was really extraordinary, it certainly put my life on a different trajectory. “As I said, it’s part of the reason I’m sitting here and I’m really grateful to have had that opportunity. And I look back on that time. It’s helped make me who I am as a person, and it helps me do the job in the way that I do it. And it confirms to me that education is one of the best tools at our disposal in politics to spread opportunity.” Labour highlighted Sunak’s previous claim that he had “maxed out” on how much support he could give state schools, while continuing to hand subsidies to “elitist private schools” through tax breaks. Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said: “Britain should have the best state schools in the world. But after 12 years of Tory neglect four in 10 of our children leave school without the qualifications they need. “Labour would end the tax giveaway Rishi Sunak hands out to his old boys’ network and use the money to improve every state school instead, ensuring everyone leaves education ready for work and ready for life.” Sunak’s personal wealth has recently come under scrutiny over investments his wife holds in Infosys, which had business in Russia. Murthy holds an estimated £690m stake in the Indian IT services company and collects about £11.5m in annual dividends. The Guardian reported last week that it was “urgently” closing its office in Russia. Pressure had been mounting on Sunak to answer accusations that his family was collecting “blood money” dividends from the firm’s continued operation in Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, called on the chancellor to reveal whether his family had been “benefiting from money made in Russia when the government has put in place sanctions” on firms and individuals. After scrutiny of his wife’s holding in Infosys, Sunak told the BBC’s Newscast that it was “very upsetting and … wrong for people to try and come at my wife”.",News/Politics,"Rishi Sunak and wife donate over £100,000 to Winchester college",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/05/rishi-sunak-and-wife-donate-over-100000-to-winchester-college
