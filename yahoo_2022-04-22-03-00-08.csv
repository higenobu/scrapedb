4/22/2022,"A fisherman in Missouri was trying to snag paddlefish when his tackle wrapped around the tail of a different fish species, officials say. Troy Staggs then spent 47 minutes fighting the 50-55 pound fish, according to a Facebook post from the Missouri Department of Conservation. He managed to reel the fish in and pull it up onto the boat — making it the second time he caught a lake sturgeon while fishing at the Lake of the Ozarks. Lake sturgeons are listed as “rare and endangered in Missouri,” and with that protection, anglers are required to release their catches after capture. Staggs did so after taking a “quick measurement” and a few photos with the fish, wildlife officials said. The lake sturgeon measured 56 inches long and officials estimate it to be about 30 years old. The species can live over 100 years and weigh over 200 pounds, making it “Missouri’s longest-lived animal and our second largest fish.” “Sturgeon evolved during the Jurassic era and survived where the dinosaurs didn’t,” officials said. ”Sturgeon are living links to the past.” This rare catch is the sixth time someone has reported reeling in a lake sturgeon at Lake of the Ozarks since 2016, officials say, and Staggs caught two of them. “Now there is something you don’t see everyday,” Edgar’s Ozark Bait & Tackle shared on Facebook. “Troy Staggs has caught not 1 but 2 sturgeon out of LOZ in the last 3 years. Awesome!” Missouri Department of Conservation began stocking waterways with lake sturgeon in the 1980s and continues to do so in hopes of recovering the species, according to the post. “Despite its name, in Missouri this fish is almost always found in big rivers, not lakes,” according to wildlife officials. “It prefers firm, silt-free bottoms of sand, gravel, and rock.” The fish are considered “bottom-feeding predator-scavengers specially fitted for life in the swift currents of our big rivers,” officials say, and “their role cannot be duplicated by other fish.” Lake sturgeons reach adulthood at about 25 years old, officials say, when they will “move into tributary streams to spawn. This makes them more visible as the fish frequently spawn in shallow water.” If you catch or see a lake sturgeon, the department encourages you to notify local conservation agents or call the lake sturgeon recovery leader at 573-248-2530. Lake of the Ozarks is about 150 miles southeast of Kansas City.

4/22/2022,"Walmart fired Marlo Spaeth, an employee with Down syndrome who worked at the store for 16 years, in 2015. Six years later, a jury found Walmart guilty of discrimination and awarded Spaeth $125 million, which a judge later reduced to $300,000. On Tuesday, Walmart filed for a new trial and asked for punitive damages to be dropped. Walmart is seeking a new trial in an employee disability-discrimination case that concluded in July after a six-year legal battle, according to court documents filed Tuesday night. The lawsuit is centered around the firing of Marlo Spaeth, an employee with Down syndrome who worked at a Walmart store in Wisconsin for 16 years. A federal jury determined in July that Walmart's treatment of Spaeth violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and awarded her $125 million in damages. The award was later reduced to $300,000, which is the maximum amount allowed under federal law. Spaeth was fired for excessive absenteeism in 2015 after Walmart transitioned to a digital timetable system, which altered her longtime work schedule. Spaeth and her sister repeatedly requested for her old shifts to be reinstated, according to the lawsuit. Instead, she was fired. Walmart is now requesting a new trial, claiming that management was unaware Spaeth's ""difficulty adjusting to her new schedule was linked to her Down syndrome."" In Tuesday's court filing, Walmart said this lack of knowledge means Spaeth's termination was not an act ""malice or reckless indifference"" toward her disability. ""This means that Walmart is entitled to a new trial. And the jury's $150,000 compensatory damages award is grossly excessive,"" the court document says. In March, a federal judge ordered Walmart to rehire Spaeth, which the Wisconsin store has agreed to. Amy Jo Stevenson, Spaeth's sister, told CNBC that they are in the process of determining her official start date. Walmart spokesperson Randy Hargrove declined to comment beyond the court filing. The EEOC did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Stevenson told CNBC on Wednesday that she believes ""the jury got it right the first time"" and that Spaeth was eager to return to work as a Walmart associate. ""She's going to walk in there proud as a peacock,"" Stevenson told CNBC's reporters last week. ""That's who she is. She is a Walmart associate. To be that again will make her whole in some sense.""

4/22/2022,"STORY: Elon Musk has secured $46.5 billion to buy Twitter and is considering a tender offer for its shares. That’s according to a new filing with U.S. regulators. It follows a series of cryptic tweets including ""Love Me Tender"" and an apparent reference to ""Tender is the Night."" A tender offer would bring Musk's bid directly to shareholders to buy their stock. Musk himself has committed to put up $33.5 billion to finance the transaction, while banks, including Morgan Stanley, have agreed to provide another $13 billion in debt secured against Twitter itself, according to the filing. Musk's latest move comes after Twitter failed to respond to his offer and adopted a ""poison pill"" to thwart the billionaire's effort to buy the company for $43 billion. Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutist,"" has said the social media platform needs to be taken private to grow and become a platform for free speech. The offer from Musk, who is Twitter's second-largest shareholder with a 9% stake, has drawn private equity interest in a buyout, according to Reuters reporting. Apollo Global Management is considering ways it can provide financing to any deal and is open to working with Musk or any other bidder, while Thoma Bravo has informed Twitter that it is exploring the possibility of putting together a bid.",Business/Reuters Videos,Musk secures $46.5B in funding for Twitter bid,https://news.yahoo.com/musk-secures-46-5b-funding-171241858.html
