2/20/2022,"The avocado ban is toast. US officials announced on Friday that imports from Mexico had resumed, following a temporary ban that stemmed from a threat against an American agricultural inspector.  The US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (Aphis) said avocado inspections in Michoacán, Mexico had restarted, allowing imports to follow. US officials said the threat was made on 11 February. The Mexican agriculture department said an inspector received a menacing message on his phone. Aphis said inspection officials were now “working closely” with a security officer at the US embassy, the Mexican national plant protection organization and the Association of Avocado Producers and Packers Exporters of Mexico. It added that it had “enacted additional measures that enhance safety for … inspectors working in the field”. “The safety of USDA employees simply doing their jobs is of paramount importance,” the agency said. “USDA is appreciative of the positive, collaborative relationship between the United States and Mexico that made resolution of this issue possible in a timely manner.” Michoacán is the only state in Mexico that has a permit to export avocados to the US. Mexican growers and packers say they are frequently targeted with violence and threats from organized crime. In 2021, the US imported $3bn in avocados, with $2.8bn originating from Mexico. That equates to 1.2m metric tons of the buttery fruit, 1.1m tons from Mexico. Mexico’s avocado exports total $3.2bn. About 80% of these exports go to the US. “Mexico and the United States will continue working together to fortify the strong bilateral supply chains that promote economic growth and prosperity in both countries,” US officials said.",News/US news,Holy guacamole: US gives green light to Mexico avocado imports after short ban,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/19/avocado-us-mexico-import-ban
2/20/2022,"US golf courses owned by Donald Trump could host events in a hugely controversial new league funded by Saudi Arabia, the Washington Post reported on Saturday.  Citing three anonymous sources, the newspaper said courses in Bedminster, New Jersey, and Doral, Florida, could host events after discussions between the Trump Organization and LIV Golf Investments, a body funded by the Saudis. One source, the Post said, indicated Trump had spoken to Greg Norman, the Australian two-time British Open champion and longtime Trump friend who heads LIV Golf Investments. Events at Trump properties would prove hugely controversial, not just because the Saudi plans have riven world golf due to Riyadh’s abysmal record on human rights. Trump remains a hugely divisive force in US life. He was impeached twice as president, the second time for inciting the deadly attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, in service of his lie that his defeat by Joe Biden was the result of electoral fraud. Free to run for office again, he remains the favourite to win the Republican nomination in 2024, prompting some observers to warn of likely civil unrest. Trump’s golf courses are also caught up in investigations of his business affairs, concerning whether property valuations were manipulated for tax purposes. The Guardian reported on affairs at one course, Briarcliff Manor in New York, as long ago as 2016, under the headline: “How Trump’s $50m golf club became $1.4m when it came time to pay tax.” Trump denies wrongdoing but a judge ruled this week that he and two of his children, Donald Jr and Ivanka, must co-operate with the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, in her civil investigation. Amid heavy pressure on Trump’s business empire, his golf properties have been widely reported to be in financial difficulty, among them those in Scotland. Trump courses no longer hold events on the PGA Tour, after the US governing body pulled out of partnerships because of Trump’s political campaigning before and after the Capitol attack. The Saudi golf gambit has stirred huge controversy given Riyadh’s record on human rights, particularly regarding the murder, dismemberment and disposal of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, in 2018. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, is widely held to have ordered the murder. But he is also a key US ally close to Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser. In 2020, Trump told the Post reporter Bob Woodward he had “saved [the prince’s] ass” and “was able to get Congress to leave him alone. I was able to get them to stop.” Representatives for the Trump Organization, the Saudi government and LIV Golf Investments did not comment to the Post. A spokesman for Trump, Taylor Budowich, said: “It certainly sounds possible given the fact that President Trump owns some of the most beautiful and renowned golf courses in the world – from the cliffs of Rancho Palos Verdes, to the majestic rolling hills of Bedminster and, of course, the iconic Doral property.” Elsewhere, it was reported this week that the US golfer Phil Mickelson, a former world No 1, called the Saudis “scary motherfuckers” but said the new league would offer a chance to reshape world golf. “They’re scary motherfuckers to get involved with,” Alan Shipnuck, the author of a forthcoming unauthorized biography of Mickelson, quoted the golfer as saying. “We know they killed Khashoggi and have a horrible record on human rights. They execute people over there for being gay. “Knowing all of this, why would I even consider it? Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates … The Saudi money has finally given us leverage. I’m not sure I even want [the Saudi league] to succeed, but just the idea of it is allowing us to get things done with the [PGA] Tour.” ",News/US news,Trump golf courses could host events for controversial Saudi-funded league – report,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/19/trump-golf-courses-saudi-arabia-league-liv
2/20/2022,"Richard Kilty says he will never forgive his teammate CJ Ujah for his “sloppy and reckless” behaviour that led to Britain’s 4x100m relay team being stripped of their Tokyo Olympic silver medal. Kilty also admitted that he is yet to work out how to tell his five-year-old son, Richard Jr, that his medal will have to be returned after Ujah’s failed drugs test was confirmed by the court of arbitration for sport.  “To finally reach the pinnacle and win an Olympic medal, and then to lose it because one person has just been sloppy and reckless with what’s gone into their body, is heartbreaking,” said Kilty. “Now he’s made that mistake I don’t think I’ll ever be able to forgive him because me, Zharnel Hughes and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake have lost a medal at the hands of his mistakes.” His anguish was shared by his relay teammate Mitchell-Blake who said he was “heartbroken”. “I was happy that some news came out so we can actually get the process going,” said the 27-year-old sprinter. “But then it’s a nail in the coffin saying you’re getting stripped of your Olympic silver medal. It hasn’t really 100% sunk in yet, but when you say it and repeat it and think about it, it’s not a nice feeling. We’re all heartbroken by it. It’s gutting for us, the nation, everybody.” Ujah said in a statement on Friday he had “unknowingly consumed a contaminated supplement” and apologised to his “teammates, their families and support teams”. However, Kilty revealed that Ujah had admitted to his teammates in a Zoom call that he had been taking supplements that were not protected by being batch-tested by Informed Sport – meaning he had no defence when his banned test was revealed. “We do a 45-minute workshop before we go to the Olympic Games,” said Kilty. “You have to do it. It’s mandatory. And it explains only take Informed Sports supplements.” Britain were stripped of their silver after Ujah was found to have two banned drugs, ostarine and S23, in a urine sample taken at the Games. “If you break the rules, you’ve got to live with the consequences,” said Kilty. “We know the rules. The rules are this – if you take drugs, you get banned. You’re cheating. I’m not calling out CJ. I’m not saying that the guy purposely went out and took drugs. Only he knows if he has or hasn’t. Could he look me in the eye and tell the truth? That is the question. Only he knows the truth.” Kilty said that he had spoken to Ujah six or seven weeks ago, and he had told him that he had not used an Informed Sport batch of supplements – meaning he had no protection when he tested positive. “For the last 20 years of my career – the same as the other two lads – we have worked our asses off. We have followed the rules, in and out. I know for a fact that I’m never going to fail a drug test for two reasons. One, I don’t take drugs. Two, every supplement and everything that I put into my body, that’s on me and I make sure whatever goes into my body is checked. My supplements are checked. And I know for a fact I’m never going to fail a drug test because I’m not a drug cheat and I follow the rules.” Kilty also revealed he never had the chance to let his son take his silver medal into school due to Ujah’s failed drugs test – and now had to work out how to tell him that he would have to send it back. “When I finally brought the medal home my son was so proud of it,” he said. “I think he’ll probably understand it more in a year or two, when I can explain to him. “But this case has also got to be an example to every young athlete in the country who comes on to the British athletics team who wants to be an Olympian. You are accountable for what goes into your body. Please check your supplements for yourself. For your teammates. Please follow the rules. Because me, Nethaneel and Zharnel have been burned by a teammate. It’s really important that we as a team now, you know, really impress that to the next generation of young athletes that this is what happens.”",Sport/Sport,Kilty will never forgive ‘reckless’ Ujah for costing GB Olympic relay silver,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/19/kilty-will-never-forgive-reckless-ujah-for-costing-gb-olympic-relay-silver
2/20/2022,"There is a certain symmetry in Wales being the visitors for England’s first home match of this year’s Six Nations on 26 February.. It could be the first major international sporting event staged in England after all Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted and it will be the first Six Nations match England have played at Twickenham in front of spectators for almost two years – since, as fate would have it, Wales were the visitors in 2020. In many ways that match feels like a lifetime ago. The pandemic was taking hold, England’s following fixture against Italy had already been postponed but 80,000-plus supporters piled into Twickenham regardless. The government had evidently not grasped the seriousness of the situation, to the extent that Boris Johnson was a guest of honour at Twickenham that day – something that was subsequently held up as a reason for Cheltenham Festival going ahead a few days later.  It was hardly the last days of Rome but there was a febrile air around Twickenham, a sense that with growing uncertainty around the corner, a known unknown on the horizon, a certain wildness was taking hold. That was reflected on the pitch, too, as England eked out a 33-30 victory in what would have been remembered as one of the more dramatic Six Nations matches in recent history, but for the pandemic swiftly putting things into perspective. As is often the case in these fixtures, England romped into a sizeable 20-6 lead at half-time but Wales came roaring back, inspired by a stunning Justin Tipuric try. England finished the contest with 13 men after Manu Tuilagi was sent off with Ellis Genge already in the sin-bin and Wales would surely have prevailed had there been another couple of minutes. It was the match when Joe Marler earned himself a 10-week ban for grabbing Alun Wyn Jones’s genitals and Eddie Jones a fine for his post-match comments about the referee, Ben O’Keeffe. If Saturday is half as eventful it is not to be missed but as this fixture bookends an unprecedented two‑year period – the obvious caveat that the lifting of restrictions does not mean the end to the pandemic – it is worth considering England’s development in those 24 months. There are mitigating factors – the empty stadiums being chief among them – but while England won the 2020 Autumn Nations Cup there was little cause for excitement. Perhaps that triumph papered over cracks because they were desperate in last year’s Six Nations before Jones began his “New England” overhaul in the summer, continuing it in the autumn and across this campaign. Senior figures were jettisoned, the Saracens-centric leadership group was replaced and perhaps most significantly England have had to learn to cope without Owen Farrell for all but 68 minutes since last March’s heavy defeat by Ireland. Last week’s victory in Italy told us little other than that Marcus Smith can be electric when afforded time, space and front-foot ball and if there seems to be an obsession with the Harlequins fly-half it is largely because this England project and its progress are hard to gauge. There were positives against Scotland but familiar failings in the final quarter and inevitable periods of tedium against Italy. It is the forthcoming back-to-back matches at Twickenham against Wales and Ireland, then, that will shape the campaign. Maro Itoje talks about a revitalisation taking place and in terms of personnel, against Wales you would expect about 50% turnover from the side who won the fixture in 2020. More than that, though, England seem re-energised and no longer suffering from the bubble fatigue of 12 months ago. “There’s been a change of personnel within the squad, coaches, and I guess a bit of a revitalisation of the squad and environment since before lockdown,” says Itoje. “We probably made a step in the direction, in terms of style, in how we want to play the game. We want to attack and want to be a bit more attacking focused than we were in previous years, following on from the theme of the autumn. “Set piece, defence and kicking will always be a strong part of the game, they are the pillars that will win Test matches, but we do want to add this attacking dynamism to our game as well.” That last point will please a crowd eager to see England on the attack, having been sent home with a spring in their step by the dramatic victory over South Africa to bring the curtain down on the autumn campaign. It cannot be a coincidence that by this stage last year there had been three away victories, discounting matches against Italy, but this time, with supporters back en masse, there have been none. Perhaps Jones had a point when raising concerns over his players’ arousal levels a year ago in the absence of supporters. “Twickenham, a packed house, against Wales – it will be amazing,” says Itoje. “These are the moments. These are the games that you desperately want to be a part of. These are the games you shouldn’t take for granted because they are truly special atmospheres. They are always intense, tough games. “There is a lot of passion, a lot of pride on both sides of the field. They tend to be enjoyable, high‑pressure. These are the games that you want to play.”",Sport/Sport,Refreshed England go on the offensive as Maro Itoje welcomes Wales test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/19/refreshed-england-go-on-the-offensive-as-maro-itoje-welcomes-wales-test
2/20/2022,"About an hour before kick-off at the Etihad Stadium a member of staff walks around handing out puzzles. At most grounds they are more popularly known as “team sheets”, but ever since Pep Guardiola arrived at Manchester City the exercise of deciphering his starting XI has become almost as absorbing as watching it. Brows are furrowed. Heads are scratched. Is that Bernardo Silva as a false 9? João Cancelo in midfield? That can’t be an 8, or a 7, and the 5 goes there, so … Ederson at centre-half? The real trick, of course, is realising that at Guardiola’s City, formations and starting points are largely an irrelevance. Roles switch every 10 minutes. Positions switch every 10 seconds. What matters is the situation, of which no two are ever the same. City’s equalising goal came from a Raheem Sterling cross, attacked by Kevin De Bruyne at the near post, bundled home by Ilkay Gündogan. But you could swap any of those three names around and still picture exactly what happened.  Guardiola loves players who can do it all, which brings us neatly to the protagonist in this enthralling, physical, warp-speed game. The fact that it was Harry Kane who undid City on Saturday provided the obvious narrative hook. But as the home side pounded away in the second half, swapping positions, picking and rolling, weaving their customary triangles, there was also a certain footballing irony at work here. What made Kane’s performance one of the greatest by a Tottenham player in the last 30 years was its multiple levels of excellence. Yes, Lucas Moura scored a hat-trick in a Champions League semi-final and Gareth Bale destroyed Internazionale on his own. But Kane did more than score and create. He was essential in restricting the service to Rodri in the City midfield. He helped marshal the defence at set pieces. He kept possession when he needed to, played rough when he needed to. He brought others into the game. Kane made 22 touches in the first 59 minutes. About half of them had been exquisite. One was the sumptuous first-time through ball around the corner that created Dejan Kulusevski’s opening goal. And the vast majority had come in a little midfield band 10 yards either side of the halfway line. Not a single touch was in the penalty area. This was playmaker Kane, the deep-lying springboard, the platform-layer. This evolution over the last two or three seasons has been well-documented. But what exactly is Kane now, almost a decade after his Premier League debut? A 9½? A striker who drops deep? A No 10-cum-quarterback? What feels absolutely certain is that playing Kane as a simple meat-and-two-veg centre-forward is pretty much the least interesting thing you can do with him these days. Yet as the hour mark dawned Kane was yet to make his mark in the City box. Characteristically, the move that produced his first goal began with his own diagonal pass to Son Heung-min. As Son regathered the ball and looked for a cross, Kane suddenly charged forward. It was as if some old ley line of memory, some vision of a former life, had twitched awake in him. And yet this was not really a Kane-type tap-in at all: rather it brought to mind a midfield poacher such as Frank Lampard or Bryan Robson, or even Gündogan. And so came the agonising finish: the swinging crosses, the desperate defensive rearguard, the mesmerising whirl of blue shirts, the inevitable City equaliser via a VAR penalty. But in the fifth minute of injury time, as City roused themselves for one last push, Kane rose highest to nod in Kulusevski’s cross and burgle a spectacular winning goal. Pressing midfielder, playmaker, false forward: and yet here at the very end was a reminder that for the many masks Kane wore here, the original remains the best. The obvious question in the short term is what Kane, now bubbling to a peak after an indifferent autumn, can do for Tottenham. Great moments do not necessarily presage a change in the weather: the great robbery of Leicester a few weeks ago was not the new dawn it felt like at the time. The home form remains a real concern. But Champions League qualification and perhaps even an FA Cup tilt no longer feels like a distant ambition. The more intriguing question is what City might have done for Kane, had that summer transfer flirtation been consummated. The old assumption was that Kane would simply be the fairy on Guardiola’s Christmas tree, banging in 40 tap-ins a season and finally solving their penalty problem. But as this game showed, Kane can be so much more. In a strange way, he already feels like a Guardiola player in his appreciation of space, his hybrid instincts, his ability to flick through roles in an instant. Idle conjecture for now. But maybe not for too much longer.",Sport/Football,Mercurial Kane wears his different masks to stun Manchester City | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/19/harry-kane-tottenham-manchester-city
