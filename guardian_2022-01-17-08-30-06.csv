You’ve found yourself a moment of reprieve with Five Great Reads, a weekday summer wrap of worthwhile writing selected by me, Alyx Gorman, Guardian Australia’s galoshes, goulash and galavanting editor.  If you’re in search of breaking news, allow me to redirect you to our live blog. And if you can feel a headache coming on, here’s a handy guide to exercising with migraines. Now, on to the reads!
