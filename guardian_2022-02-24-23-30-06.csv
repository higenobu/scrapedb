2/24/2022,"A dark, sombre mood filled the Moscow air on Thursday morning as Russians were coming to terms with the fact that their president had launched a broad military offensive targeting Ukraine. “I am embarrassed for my country. To be honest with you, I am speechless. War is always scary. We don’t want this,” said Nikita Golubev, a 30-year old teacher.  “Why are we doing this?” he added, expressing a sentiment of anger and hopelessness that was shared by many commuting to work down central Arbat Street. At the Ukrainian culture centre just down the road, the mood was even grimmer. The Ukrainian administrator said the centre, which aims to promote the language, traditions and identity of a country Vladimir Putin denied the legitimacy of as a modern state in his speech on Monday, would be shut for the “coming period”. “We are being bombed as we speak. Of course we are closed! Jesus, what is happening?” the administrator, who did not want to give his name, shouted. Just a day earlier, Ukraine advised its estimated 3 million citizens living in Russia to leave the country immediately, throwing the lives of many Ukrainians in Moscow into disarray There were already signs that Russians were uncomfortable with Putin’s initial decision to recognise the two self-proclaimed republics in Donbas. On Tuesday, Yuri Dudt, one of Russia’s most popular media personalities, said he “did not vote for this regime” and its need for an empire and felt ashamed, in a post that received almost a million likes in 24 hours. A fresh poll by the independent Levada Center released on Thursday showed that only 45% of Russians stood in favour of the recognition move that preceded Thursday morning’s dramatic events. “I didn’t think Putin would be willing to go all the way. How can we bomb Ukraine? Our countries have their disagreements, but this is not a way to solve them,” said Muscovite Ksenia. But outcries of anger were not only felt on the streets of Moscow, where the Guardian did not encounter support for the military assault. Russia’s cultural and sporting elite, usually firmly behind Putin and often called upon by the president during election campaigns to gather popular support, also expressed their deep worries about Russia’s invasion. Valery Meladze, arguable the country’s most beloved singer, posted an emotional video in which “begged” Russia to stop the war. “Today something happened that should have never happened. History will be the judge of these events. But today, I beg you, please stop the war.” Likewise, Russian football international Fyodor Smolov posted on his Instagram channel: “No to War!!!” US intelligence for months warned that Russia would seek to fabricate a major pretext before launching an invasion of Ukraine. In the end, no major false flag came, and experts now believe that Putin decided to act without gathering the backing of his own electorate. “Putin seems totally indifferent to approval on the street. He’s acting not like a politician in need of public support, but like a figure from national history books who cares only about the approval of future historians and readers,” tweeted Alexander Baunov, a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center. The Russian leader looked to have also surprised some of Russia’s most prominent oligarchs, who saw their wealth tumble as the country’s financial markets collapsed. Just on Monday, after Putin recognised the independence of the two Donbas territories, Oleg Deripaska, a Kremlin-friendly oligarch who once said that “he does not separate himself from the Russian state”, exclaimed on his Telegram channel that “war had been averted”. He has since deleted the post. As the invasion news settled in, people in Moscow began circulating posts online urging others to “go on a walk” on Thursday evening, a phrase used to describe protests that have been outlawed since the start of the pandemic. But in a country where a single picket protest can land you in jail, and which saw an unprecedented crackdown on the opposition in the last few years, it remains a question to what extent Russians will be able and willing to take to streets to show their opposition to the bloody conflict. A notable police presence was seen at Red Square and Pushkin Square, places known to host protests. For Ukrainians, the apparent public opposition to the war and messages of support will come too late. The country has said that at least 40 soldiers have already been killed with many more civilians injured, as it is threatened with being overrun by a much larger military force. Yet, sensing that a genuine large-scale pushback against war might be Ukraine’s best bet, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, on Thursday morning urged Russians to speak up. “If the Russian authorities don’t want to sit down with us to discuss peace, maybe they will sit down with you.”",News/World news,‘We don’t want this’: Russians react to the Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/we-dont-want-this-russians-react-to-the-ukraine-invasion
2/24/2022,"Andrew Marr has promised to ruffle feathers when he launches his new LBC radio show next month by taking advantage of the freedom he has gained by leaving the BBC. The former BBC political editor will host his own hour-long programme at 6pm between Monday and Thursday. He previously said he was looking forward to “getting my voice back” after being freed from the BBC’s impartiality requirements.  While the national broadcaster is increasingly cracking down on any presenter who dares to express even a mild personal opinion, stations such as LBC are hitting record ratings by encouraging their hosts to take provocative political stances. Marr said: “I’ve always thought journalism is about breaking stories, ruffling feathers and having some fun on the way … Anyone wanting bland, safe, wearily predictable journalism is strongly advised to look elsewhere.” The announcement means Eddie Mair, another former BBC presenter, will have to give up the final hour of his LBC show to make way for Marr. The BBC has been hit hard by the increasingly competitive market for political journalism in the UK which has seen deep-pocketed commercial media companies poach BBC presenters. Earlier this week Global, the media company that owns LBC, hired Jon Sopel and Emily Maitlis from the BBC to host a new podcast – while Rupert Murdoch’s News UK made large offers to hire BBC staff for its TimesRadio station and forthcoming talkTV service. Marr’s LBC show will also be broadcast live as a video stream, another indication that the division between radio and television is increasingly blurred. Marr gave up a £340,000 salary when he left the BBC but will now hold a variety of jobs, including the New Statesman’s chief political commentator and presenting a show on LBC’s sister station Classic FM. While BBC staff are required to declare outside earnings from paid speaking gigs, there is no such scrutiny for employees of commercial organisations. It is not only on-air talent jumping ship from the BBC but also the behind-the-scenes producers. Marr’s show will be put together by former BBC staff, including ex-political programming boss Rob Burley, who oversaw Marr’s Sunday politics show, as well as Newsnight producer Matt Harris.",News/Media,Andrew Marr vows to ‘ruffle feathers’ on LBC after quitting BBC ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/24/andrew-marr-vows-to-ruffle-feathers-on-lbc-after-quitting-bbc
2/24/2022,"Russia has unleashed a significant, wide-ranging attack on Ukraine with its forces launching a series of missile and helicopter attacks at locations around the country and advancing well into Ukraine’s territory. Although it remains challenging to obtain an overall picture or to establish the level of resistance being put up by Ukrainian forces, social media imagery reveals some of Russia’s initial military action – which began at 5am – and its consequences.  Western defence officials have said repeatedly while Russia was likely to attack on “multiple axes”, the primary goal is to encircle the capital Kyiv and ultimately try to provoke regime change. On Thursday morning there were already clear signs of fighting and other military activity around and on the way to the capital. An ambitious attack by multiple helicopters on the Gostomel military airbase on the outskirts of Kyiv, designed to leapfrog the advance of ground forces, was widely captured on social media, suggesting that Russia already appeared to have a degree of air superiority. Ukraine said it had downed three of the Russian helicopters, according to Reuters. Justin Bronk​, from the Rusi thinktank, said if airborne assault troops can take and hold the airbase, the Russians could use it to rapidly build up forces ahead of heavy ground troops to put pressure on the capital. “However, it’s high risk because until ground forces link up, the airborne assault forces are deep in Ukrainian territory and dependent on aerial resupply, casualty evacuation and fire support,” he said. Credible reports from the Ukrainian border guard service, senior officials and journalists close to the northern border with Belarus described one Russian axis of advance centred around the Senkivka border crossing to the north east of Chernihiv where a column of Russian armour was seen advancing. Crucial, perhaps, in this calculation is the fact that south of Chernihiv – which lies to the east of the Dnieper river – lies the E95 highway to Kyiv. A substantial attack appeared aimed towards the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has a population of more than 1 million. Multiple reports from Kharkiv, described explosions nearby – while Ukraine’s defence ministry said mid morning that “fierce fights” were taking place in that area. Russian forces also headed north from Crimea, at least initially not meeting any obvious resistance. Ukrainian border guards released security camera footage on Thursday showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine’s government-held territory from Russian-annexed Crimea. Social media footage appeared to show Russian forces reaching Kherson on the Dnieper, 130km inside Ukraine. Shortly after, at lunchtime, a Ukrainian presidential adviser said fierce fighting was taking place there. Film posted online was said to show Russian helicopters over the nearby Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. Andriy Zagorodnyuk, Ukraine’s former defence minister, said: “They are quite close to the city of Kherson now. The situation is really critical there. They are also trying to surround Kharkiv. It seems like Kharkiv at the moment is the main target.” Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had destroyed 74 “objects of above-ground military infrastructure”, though this could not be confirmed. Air and missile strikes appear so far to be mostly focused on military targets, including an air defence site in the frontier down of Mariupol, the Ukrainian naval base in Ochakiv and at an arms depot in Kalynivka, 200km south west of Kyiv, according to the defence intelligence specialists Rochan Consulting. Reports of casualties have quickly emerged. Eighteen were reported killed by the local administration after an airstrike on a military base near Odessa. Some of the Russian ambition too has been explicitly aimed at demoralising Ukrainian civilians with the reach of the offensive. While much of the initial barrage was aimed at the east of Ukraine, so far more sporadic strikes on cities in the west from Uman to Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk seem designed to demonstrate the reach of Russian weapons. “The Ukrainian military is waging hard battles, repelling attacks in Donbas and other regions in the east, north and south,” Zelenskiy said at a briefing, confirming the shape of the Russian military effort, adding that Ukrainian authorities will hand weapons to all those willing to defend the country. Far harder to evaluate have been reports of casualties on both sides and the resistance by Ukrainian defence forces. Russia has amassed more than 150,000 combat troops on the borders of Ukraine, with another 34,000 lightly armed separatist forces in the pro-Russian self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk. That amounts to an estimated two-thirds of Russia’s total ground forces. Half of Moscow’s air force is also deployed in the region. Ukraine’s forces are far smaller. It has a regular army that numbers 125,600 according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, but has mobilised reserves of at least 36,000.",News/World news,War in Ukraine: where has Russia attacked?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/war-ukraine-kyiv-map-where-has-russia-attacked
2/24/2022,"The Russian central bank has purchased millions of roubles to prevent the collapse of the Moscow stock exchange and prop up the currency after it plunged to an all-time low of 89.60 against the dollar. In a scramble to prevent the invasion of Ukraine pushing Russia’s financial system into meltdown, officials in Moscow closed the stock exchange while the Bank of Russia mounted a rescue operation to put a floor under the skidding rouble.  By midday, the stock market had reopened and the rouble recovered to trade at 84 to the dollar, though analysts said an escalation of the war could force the central bank to intervene further to prevent the currency sinking to an even lower all-time low. “To stabilise the situation on the financial market, the Bank of Russia decided to start interventions on the currency market,” the central bank said. Russia’s main stock exchange fell 30% after reopening, while the MSCI index of shares in Russian companies traded in London and New York dropped 45%. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia had created a financial safety net to withstand market volatility and said the “emotional” reaction from the financial market to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would even out. He added that all necessary measures were being taken to ensure the market reaction was as brief as possible. After weeks of denying plans to attack Ukraine, Russian forces fired missiles at several Ukrainian cities and landed troops on its coast, prompting analysts to predict that severe pressure on global financial markets was likely to persist over the coming weeks. Russia’s currency, bonds and stocks all sank before its central bank announced its first foreign exchange intervention to shore up financial stability since 2014, when the country annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Russia holds a formidable war chest of more than $600bn (£450bn) in foreign-exchange reserves and gold that it can use in currency markets to prop up the rouble. A rapidly depreciating currency makes it harder to pay off foreign debts and leads to higher prices on imported goods. A slump in the rouble will also knock returns on exports, especially gas and oil sales to Russia’s main markets across Europe. Officials at the Bank of Russia are understood to have sold foreign reserves to buy roubles to put a floor under the price, though it is not clear the extent of the buying operation. One of the biggest falls in the value of the rouble was against the euro. Before the recent round of geopolitical tensions between Moscow and the west began to escalate in October, the rouble was trading at around 80 to the euro. It is now nearer 90. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Market volatility has increased since the beginning of the year, stoked by rising interest rates, and today’s news has added fuel to the market turbulence.” As the US said it may cut off Russia’s top banks from dollar transactions should Moscow move its troops into Ukraine, data showed in December that Russian banks brought $5bn in foreign exchange back to Moscow and moved some of their long-term foreign exchange holdings into more liquid assets if needed in an emergency. To support Russian commercial banks under pressure from falling share prices and western sanctions, the central bank increased the daily amount of roubles it would swap for dollars from $3bn to $5bn. This will allow commercial banks to replenish their dollar stocks needed to repay foreign debts. The Bank of Russia also expanded the list of securities it accepted as collateral in exchange for liquidity it provided. Markets are now bracing for the impact of fresh and harsh western sanctions to punish Moscow for the invasion of Ukraine. “The sanctions hit is going to be significant, unlike the soft sanctions imposed on Tuesday and Wednesday,” said the investment firm Renaissance Capital. The effective interest rate on Russian government debt soared to almost 10% as bond investors sold heavily to seek safer havens, although the effect is expected to be limited as most of the debt is held by domestic financial institutions. Ukraine’s government debt collapsed in value, pushing the country towards a further bailout by the International Monetary Fund. The Washington-based lender of last resort said this week it was poised to start a virtual mission to Ukraine with a view to releasing $700m in aid. Since 2014, the IMF has committed more than $20bn in loans to Ukraine in a series of bailouts, though in 2019 it demanded Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government show it would aggressively try to recoup an estimated $15bn that was stolen from more than 100 banks, including the country’s largest, PrivatBank, over the previous decade before a further $4bn was released. The Russian central bank is expected to ease pressure on the rouble further by increasing its main interest rate, which it hopes will lure back foreign investors searching for high returns. The bank is also expected to continue monetary tightening by raising interest rates as it struggles to rein in inflation, which is set to worsen from the falling rouble.",News/Business,Russian central bank buys up roubles to avert stock market collapse,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/russian-central-bank-buys-up-roubles-to-avert-stock-market-collapse-invasion-ukraine-fiancial-meltdown
2/24/2022,"The best line so far in The Marvelous Mrs Maisel – the Emmy award-winning comedy drama about a New York-50s-housewife-turned-standup-comic – isn’t a joke she delivers in a set on a dingy club stage. It isn’t even one of the endless, off-stage zingers by creator Amy Sherman-Palladino (also behind Gilmore Girls). It is, in fact, the searing three-word reply that Midge (Rachel Brosnahan) fires at her husband, Joel (Michael Zegen), halfway through season one, when he asks why she won’t give their marriage another shot: “Because you left.” In that moment, Mrs Maisel becomes the ultimate single woman’s icon. In a world that measures her success and identity by her marital status, she makes the decision to be a single mother and blindly embrace whatever is ahead. While the social stigmas attached to being unmarried might have relaxed since Midge’s time, the reality today is this: in 2019 five hospital trusts and six clinical commissioning groups banned single women from accessing IVF; our prime minister once said the children of single women are “ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate”; single people feel priced out of owning a house while couples have a double income; and – take it from someone who knows – if you’re not standing on a soapbox shouting “single, fierce and independent!”, friends and family assume you’re sitting at home feeling sad with the cat (or without the cat, because the landlord won’t allow it).  Midge’s message is a reminder to know your self-worth, forget about societal expectations and take no shit. There’s also the fact that she’s very, very funny and unafraid to constantly crack the punchlines – another defiance, this time of the “women aren’t funny” trope (again, something that female comedians still face today). They are the very reasons why, say, a single woman might have felt completely uplifted while rewatching the series for a third time in lockdown after heartbreak. Because, when Joel left, Midge turned her assumed failures into her biggest strengths – and the real Mrs Maisel arrived. When her husband left her for his 21-year-old secretary Penny Pann, Midge laughs at him. “A girl who doesn’t know how to use an electric pencil sharpener?” she guffaws. “Grab some pens on the way out – you’re gonna need them.” Rather than chase after her husband , she downs a bottle of Yom Kippur wine and ends up stumbling on stage in a comedy club, performing a monologue about what has just happened. She establishes a knack for seamlessly snappy, observational standup that is brutally personal – a true talent for turning trauma into triumph. Rather than taking Joel back just to please everybody else, Midge takes a chance on herself as a single woman for the first time and gives this comedy thing a shot. What’s more, she does it despite society’s prejudice against divorced women. She ignores her father Abe (Tony Shalhoub) when he laments: “I’m no fan of Joel, but you need a husband”. She carries on, despite her mother, Rose (Marin Hinkle), demanding to know what Midge did wrong to cause her poor husband to leave, then walking around every room in the apartment, wailing: “Oh shiiit”. Over the following three seasons, we see gutsy Midge continue to defy society’s expectations of how a single woman should act. Comedy quickly becomes a career goal and she does everything she can to make it happen. She embraces a new female friendship with her agent Susie (Alex Borstein) – her total opposite, and someone she might not have even spoken to while married, but with whom she forms a beautifully odd and respectful working relationship (“Look at you – it’s like a dollop of whipped cream grew a head,” Susie quips to nail their dynamic). Midge swallows her pride, moves back in with her parents and seizes control of her income for the first time, taking a job at a department store and recording radio adverts for extra money, all while gigging most nights. She even ends up in a position where she can buy back her old apartment on her own (a little unrealistic, especially in today’s market, but let’s roll with it). As the show goes on, we see her increasingly act in a way that shows us that there are more important things in life than having a partner. In season two, Midge falls for Dr Benjamin Ettenberg (Zachary Levi) – the most perfect man ever to be written down on paper – only to call off their engagement because she realises she doesn’t want the relationship to compromise her comedy (in fairness, he is far too good a person to be used as material by his wife on stage every night). She also sleeps with Joel a few times, divorces him, drunkenly marries him again, then leaves things open. Things are inevitably complicated with the father of her children, who did a bad thing but isn’t necessarily a bad person. This time, though, their relationship is all on her terms, and married life is clearly no longer her ultimate goal. Then there’s the comedian Lenny Bruce (Luke Kirby – TV’s most underrated sex symbol) who becomes a mentor, friend and subject of a will-they-won’t-they storyline. “You’re living in a hotel? Who are you? Willy Loman?” Midge jibes when they very nearly sleep together in season three – but don’t, because, once again, she doesn’t want a sexual relationship with a man to hinder anything or rock the mutual respect they have for each other as comedians. Sure, Midge isn’t as perfect as her impeccable veneer. She often makes decisions that some might consider unwise or selfish, such as leaving her children for six months to go on tour with Shy Baldwin (Leroy McClain) in season three (she also takes minimal interest in their day-to-day lives). But to be a woman forging a career during that period – especially a woman in comedy – selfishness was a necessary and sometimes vital tool. Another questionable move was the uncomfortable set that gets her kicked off Shy’s tour; in not realising how her jokes about Shy’s sexuality might have crossed a line, she shows that she is still often unaware of her privilege. But Midge does what she set out to do – she becomes a standup comic. There have been so many times where she could have given up – the cancelled gigs, the non-payments, the constant sexist remarks, the offers of an easier married life with a doctor or an ex – but she keeps on going. In today’s digital age where burnout culture is the norm and women are still expected to work longer hours than men, her warrior approach is extremely relatable. Particularly as she remains true to herself while developing, saying what she wants to say on stage, always parading an outstanding wardrobe of outfits, regardless of how grimy the venue is – and making sure she turns down career opportunities that conflict with her values. In the opening act of the fourth season, which has just launched on Amazon Prime, it’s clear that Midge is done with men dictating her life. With no money, no apartment and no work lined up after being sent away from the tour, she’s out for revenge – and why the hell not? They say that anger is an unattractive trait, but Midge isn’t here to sit pretty and please anymore – and neither are women today. “I stood there, I watched that plane fly away and I realised that once again a man has stepped in and fucked up my life,” Midge tells her crowd. “I know – that’s life, shit happens, you should be the bigger man and let it go … Well, I’m a woman – so fuck that.”",Arts/Television & radio,‘The ultimate single woman’s icon’: how Mrs Maisel is an inspiration across the years ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/24/the-ultimate-single-womans-icon-how-mrs-maisel-is-an-inspiration-across-the-years
2/24/2022,"Serco bemoaned “wildly unfair” criticism of its role in the much-criticised NHS Covid-19 test-and-trace scheme, as the outsourcing firm reported increased full-year profits that could fund more than £100m in shareholder rewards. The company said it had won £700m in Covid-related contracts worldwide in 2021, taking its total pandemic-related income to £1.1bn.  This includes about £623m of UK taxpayers’ funds, according to a National Audit Office report, for work including managing a fifth of the UK’s Covid testing sites and operating contact-tracing call centres. Serco has become a focal point of public ire about the test-and-trace scheme, which was allocated a budget of £37bn, with £14bn spent by June last year, mostly on testing. Criticisms include allegations of poor performance by contract-tracing staff working for the company’s subcontractors. In a written statement, Serco’s chief executive, Rupert Soames, said “much of the criticism was wildly unfair and bore little relationship to the facts, but it was still unsettling to our colleagues to see their hard work being called into question”. But he gave investors better news, hailing the company’s “outstanding” increase in revenues and profits, which could fund more than £100m in rewards for shareholders. Annual revenues were up 14% to £4.4bn, with operating profit 21% higher than last year at £216m. Investors were treated to a 72% increase in their full-year dividend, with their 2.41p-per-share payout for the year worth £29m. The company promised to “continue on our path” of increasing returns to shareholders, including through share buybacks to a value of up to £90m. Soames, a grandson of Winston Churchill, said Covid contracts with the UK, Australia and other countries had “provided a short-term uplift to revenues and profits”. He added that the experience had “left an enduring legacy of a much more capable and efficient organisation, strong customer relationships, and lower debt”. Critics of Serco’s involvement in the government’s Covid response have pointed to its mixed record on public works, the use of subcontractors and a blunder in which it inadvertently revealed the email addresses of contract tracers. Soames said last year that much of the criticism was motivated by ideology. “There are some people who philosophically do not believe the private sector should be doing this sort of thing,” he said. For the year to the end of March 2020, Soames and Serco’s then chief financial officer, Angus Cockburn, earned £7.4m in pay, including £5.5m in bonuses. The size of this year’s package, which will include the first year of the pandemic, is expected to be announced next month when the company publishes its annual report.",News/Business,Serco’s annual profits surge 21% to £216m on back on Covid contracts,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/sercos-annual-profits-surge-21-to-216m-on-back-on-covid-contracts
2/24/2022,"UK consumers have been warned to brace themselves for a substantial increase in the cost of living, including the prospect of £2,600-a-year energy bills after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The prices of wholesale gas and oil soared on the back of the news on Thursday, leading to predictions of further rises in domestic bills.  The AA and RAC warned that petrol and diesel prices would start rising within days after crude oil prices reached record prices. Analysts are warning that household gas and electricity bills could rise by another £600 a year to £2,6000 after the Russian invasion pushed wholesale gas prices up 28% on Thursday morning. Although UK households are not heavily reliant on Russian gas, concerns that supplies from the country will be disrupted have pushed up prices on the wholesale market. After Germany halted the approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline this week, the Russian politician Dmitry Medvedevwarned that natural gas prices could double in Europe. Oil prices have risen to a seven-year high over concerns about supplies from Russia. The market turmoil is expected to cause further hardship for those already struggling to heat and light their homes. On 1 April the average dual fuel bill is already set to rise to a record £1,971, and more pain could be on the way when the regulator Ofgem reviews the maximum rate that suppliers can charge in the autumn. Roger Bird, the head of energy trading and risk at the consultancy Advantage Utilities, warned that volatility in the energy market in the coming months could easily see the cap go up by £600 or more. Should Russia cut Europe off from its gas supplies the continent would be at the mercy of a “cut-throat” industry that often sees gas supplies circle oceans and be redirected to the highest bidder, he said. “The worst-case scenario could see wholesale prices far exceed the astonishing spike previously seen around December 2021.” Simon Oscroft, a co-founder of the supplier So Energy, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that rising prices before the Russian invasion had “the potential to push prices higher for longer” than the previous spike at the end of last year, and that they could remain high for the next two years. “If prices stay where they are, it looks like there will be another price increase [in October],” he said. Dr Craig Lowrey, a senior consultant at the consultancy Cornwall Insight, said: “The reliance of Europe on Russian gas will mean any economic sanctions which affect supply levels are likely to have an immediate and potentially longer-term impact on gas prices.” Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at the financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Millions of people have fallen into the fuel poverty gap, and war between Ukraine and Russia could push even more of us over the edge.” Petrol and diesel reached record levels in the UK on Wednesday, with unleaded at nearly 149.5p a litre and diesel at almost 153p, and the RAC said petrol could rise as high as £1.60 a litre. “Russia’s actions will now push petrol pump prices up to £1.50 very soon,” said Simon Williams, the RAC’s fuel spokesperson. “The question then becomes where will this stop and how much can drivers take, just as many are using their cars more and returning to workplaces.” Williams said if oil prices rose to $110 a barrel “there’s a very real danger the average price of petrol would hit £1.55 a litre”. He said: “This would cause untold financial difficulties for many people who depend on their cars for getting to work and running their lives as it would skyrocket the cost of a full tank to £85.” If prices were to hit $120 a barrel that could translate to a price of £1.60 a litre at the pumps and £88 for a full tank, he added. However, the AA said there were other factors that would work to stabilise the price for consumers. The first is that market increases often fall back after surges earlier in the day or week, and that the cost of petrol does not go up at the same rate as oil during global events. Finally, the fuel consumption of vehicles is lower coming out of winter. Edmund King, the AA president, said: “Prices at the pumps still vary considerably and tend to be cheaper when there is supermarket competition. “To conserve fuel drivers should consider cutting out short journeys, car sharing and eco driving. Cutting speed and driving more smoothly can lead to 15% reductions in fuel consumption.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Average UK energy bills could hit £2,600 a year, consumers warned",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/24/average-uk-energy-bill-could-hit-2600-year-consumer-warned-russian-invasion-ukraine
2/24/2022,"Medication abortion accounted for the majority of all abortions for the first time in US history in 2020, a new analysis by the Guttmacher Institute has shown. Sometimes called the “abortion pill”, medication abortion is a two-drug treatment that is approved to terminate a pregnancy up to 10 weeks gestation or less. The drugs, sold under the brand name Mifeprex, have accounted for an increasingly large share of all abortions in the US since its introduction in 2000.  In 2020, the proportion of all pregnancies terminated with medication in the US jumped to 54% from 39% in 2017. Experts believe the increase was driven by the Covid-19 pandemic and updated FDA regulations, which allowed the medication to be prescribed via telemedicine. “We are seeing more people using medication abortion and some of that may have to do with the pandemic and being able to protect themselves from Covid,” said Elizabeth Nash, interim associate director of state issues at the Guttmacher Institute, a leading reproductive rights group. “Accessing medication abortion means [people] don’t have to travel long distances, take time off of work and arrange for childcare,” said Nash. “That’s important too”. What’s more, pandemic-era regulations that allowed for telehealth prescribing and mailing of abortion medication meant many people did not have to face aggressive protesters or harassment outside clinics. “Because so many abortion patients are low-income, are Black and brown individuals, are young people, are LGBTQ individuals – people who have been systematically oppressed and faced barriers to accessing healthcare – being able to get access to abortion through telehealth is incredibly important,” said Nash. Growing use of the “abortion pill” is also seen as a threat by anti-abortion campaigners, who have pushed state laws restricting access to the medication and made abortion medication the subject of online disinformation campaigns. Such campaigners would not be able to confront people seeking abortions if they are not forced to go to clinics. Anti-abortion campaigners have been emboldened by a forthcoming supreme court decision, which is expected to severely restrict abortion rights by striking at the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade ruling, which found a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy and invalidated dozens of state abortion bans nationally. A decision is expected in June. The findings about medication abortion are part of a larger set of research conducted by Guttmacher. Every three years, the institute surveys all known abortions providers in the US. The survey is not expected to conclude until later 2022. The estimated proportion of medication abortion was derived from an early analysis, and is not expected to fall below 50% even when all survey data is in. Medication abortion is regarded as very safe, and uses mifepristone, followed by misoprostol. The drugs were introduced in 2000. By 2016, more than 3 million American women had taken the drug with 19 deaths reported, an effective mortality rate of 0.00063%. By contrast, giving birth poses a risk of death 14-times higher, according to a New England Journal of Medicine commentary article (the author received an unrestricted grant from Danco Laboratories, the maker of Mifeprex). In April 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic shut down healthcare facilities across the country, the FDA temporarily allowed telemedicine prescribing and mailing of mifepristone. The decision was made permanent in December 2021. In 2022, 16 states have so far introduced restrictions on mifepristone, including seven states which have introduced legislation to outlaw medication abortion entirely. Thirty-two states already limit the healthcare providers who can prescribe medication abortion to doctors, even as providers such as nurse practitioners may also manage patient’s health. In 19 states, the prescriber must be present at the time mifepristone is administered, effectively barring telemedicine prescribing. In addition to legal restrictions, medication abortion has become the subject of disinformation campaigns by anti-abortion organizations, many of whom advertise “abortion reversal” protocols. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has described so-called abortion reversal “unproven and unethical”. The only high-quality, randomized controlled trial to be conducted on the treatment was halted in 2019 when three women suffered severe hemorrhaging and had to be hospitalized. Guttmacher released a second analysis showing it became significantly harder for low-income women to access birth control during the pandemic. A three-state survey in Arizona, Iowa and Wisconsin found between 30% and more than half of women faced delays or barriers in obtaining contraception. Those obstacles were exacerbated when women faced financial hardship caused by the pandemic.",News/World news,"Majority of US abortions in 2020 were medication abortions, analysis finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/medication-abortion-majority-2020-analysis
2/24/2022,"When Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat’s debut show of collaborative paintings premiered in 1985, it was panned by the critics. Notoriously, the New York Times’s Vivien Raynor labelled the twentysomething street artist Basquiat a “mascot” for the ageing pop art pioneer Warhol. The critical reaction drove the artists apart and they barely spoke again before Warhol’s death only 18 months later. Just three years after the exhibition, Basquiat would also be dead at 27 from a heroin overdose. The last time I spoke to Broadway star Jeremy Pope, in early 2020, he was promoting his debut major TV role in Ryan Murphy’s Hollywood, a big, brassy reimagining of 1940s Tinseltown. He was softly spoken but palpably excited, even in the midst of the rapidly developing pandemic. Once the reviews started to come in, Hollywood – like Warhol and Basquiat’s show – was the subject of a critical thumping. The Guardian labelled it a “crushing disappointment” for its revisionism of 1940s Tinseltown, while Variety deemed it a show with “little worth saying”.  Two years on, Pope is speaking to me over video call, framed by a pair of loud, mushroom-patterned curtains that have been provided as part of his digs on London’s South Bank. He is in town for the next three months playing Basquiat in a new play by The Two Popes writer Anthony McCarten, directed by the Young Vic’s artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armah. The play, The Collaboration, tells the story of that ill-fated 1985 exhibition and co-stars Paul Bettany as Warhol. So, how was it reading the Hollywood reviews and then inhabiting Basquiat during his own critical turmoil? “I’m a Cancer, so I’m sensitive,” Pope says with a smile. He seems careful to remain magnanimous, lest the critics have something to latch on to. “We do what we do because we love it and I think that should be good enough, rather than being based on someone’s subjective opinion.” He pauses. “But that’s what art is, it is a conversation. Regardless of what someone says, you have to show up the next day and tell that story on stage because you believe in it. I choose to hope that one person is affected in a positive way [by Hollywood], the same way I was affected when I read the script.” Pope is no stranger to accolades, just as he is to criticism. Back-to-back lead roles in Moonlight writer Tarell Alvin McCraney’s tale of self-discovery, Choir Boy, and Ain’t Too Proud, a jukebox musical about the Temptations, earned him two nominations at the 2019 Tony awards. It made him only the sixth person in the 73-year history of the Tonys to be up for two gongs in one season. To tackle Basquiat, though, is a new challenge. “He was a mysterious soul whose image and images are so available, but the person behind them can be an enigma,” Pope says. Rather than get bogged down in the biographies, Pope has instead been turning to Basquiat’s art as the key to understanding the man. “There was such a direct connection from his mind and his heart to the canvas. It seems the most honest and most true expression of him.” If Basquiat is an enigma, so is his relationship with Warhol. The pair first met while Basquiat was a teenager in the early 80s, frequenting Warhol’s Factory studio and trying to get a glimpse into its celebrity social set. A lunch date set up by the art dealer Bruno Bischofberger in 1982 then sparked the beginnings of a friendship and collaboration that would span the next three years. Warhol had seen his star wane throughout the 1970s, while Basquiat was the subverting street artist recently brought into the gallery world and primed to deliver new intrigue. It made for a potent combination, one that the artist Keith Haring described as “each [artist] inspiring the other to outdo the next”. Speculated as being either a vampiric attempt by an older artist to maintain relevance, or the tale of a mentorship sullied by public disapproval, playing such a complex dynamic could surely bring its own complications between Pope and his onstage sparring partner Bettany? “I’m not just saying this because we’re currently living across the hall from each other, but Paul has been such a light and has embraced me in a way that isn’t required for work,” he says. “We have both committed to playing these men and we’re digging deep – when we’re not rehearsing, we’re spending evenings going through the script and getting to the heart of the relationship.” It is a steadfast connection they will be exploring for some time to come – the play has already been picked up for a film adaptation, with the pair reprising their roles – and one that Pope believes Basquiat and Warhol also once had. “There was so much love in their relationship,” he says. “There are so many photos of them just clowning together or getting pedicures and you can’t deny that there was a true foundation of friendship and respect for each other.” So how did a handful of reviews then prompt Basquiat to stop visiting Warhol for their regular painting sessions at the Factory, and for the pair to ultimately stop speaking before Warhol’s sudden death in 1987? “Because what people say and how they view you determines how you can provide for yourself, especially for Jean as a Black man trying to make it in a white art world,” Pope says. That pressure of maintaining relevance as a minority artist is something that Pope relates to today. “There is a cost to being an artist and it is carrying the weight of the Black and queer communities I represent,” Pope says. “It can feel heavy acknowledging that responsibility. Often I wonder, am I doing enough? Or, how can I do more?” And it was the proliferation of these questions that Pope believes led to Basquiat’s own downfall. “His addiction began because there was this pressure to stay relevant and it wasn’t about fame; it was about having a stake in the conversation and being seen,” he says. For Pope, though, it is in the work of playing others that he comes to a sense of solace in himself. “I’m in the healing business, since art can heal and change the way that you think,” he says. “Playing Jean has made me feel free, which is a beautiful thing as an artist. I feel taken care of and I just hope that people who come to see us can feel loved or healed, too.” And what of those pesky critics? “This experience is something that I’ll cherish for ever – it has been fucking thrilling,” Pope says. “No review can change that.” The Collaboration is at the Young Vic, London, to 2 April. Jonathan Jones selects his favourite dramatic representations of artists Doctor Who: Vincent and the Doctor (2010) Tony Curran is a genuinely believable Van Gogh in this moving Doctor Who story. The Doctor and Amy can’t change history to stop his suicide but take him to today’s Musée d’Orsay, where he hears Bill Nighy’s critic praise him as one of the greatest artists ever. Tears. Frida (2002) Salma Hayek broke away from conventional roles to play the visionary Mexican artist in a film that aches to do justice to her pain, disabilities and defiance. Julie Taymor’s direction is sometimes too pretty for its own good but Hayek does imagine her way into being Kahlo, in all her rage and generosity. Mr Turner (2014) It took the quirky originality of writer-director Mike Leigh to find dramatic material in the private, ungiving character of English landscape painter JMW Turner. But Timothy Spall brilliantly inhabits this fish out of water in Regency society, a working-class genius in a posh milieu. Red (first performed 2009) The profoundly unhappy abstract expressionist Mark Rothko is another difficult character to fictionalise but John Logan’s play focuses on a spectacular emotional turning point, when a commission to decorate a Manhattan restaurant drove the painter (in a role first played by Alfred Molina) into agonies of moral disgust. Caravaggio (1986) There are some accidentally comic moments in Derek Jarman’s deliberately Brechtian and unrealistic life of the painter and murderer who took baroque Italy by storm, but Nigel Terry’s Caravaggio and his model, played by Sean Bean, make the artist’s queer courage explicit as he negotiates Rome’s palaces and mean streets.",Arts/Stage,"Jeremy Pope: ‘I’m in the healing business, since art can change the way that you think’",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/24/jeremy-pope-im-in-the-healing-business-since-art-can-change-the-way-that-you-think
2/24/2022,"A court in Islamabad has sentenced to death the tycoon’s son who raped and murdered Noor Mukadam, a case that sparked outrage in Pakistan. Mukadam, 27, the daughter of a former Pakistani diplomat, was held captive, tortured and beheaded in July last year by Zahir Jaffer, a member of a well-known industrialist family.  Jaffer, 30, a Pakistani-American citizen, is thought to have attacked Mukadam after she refused his marriage proposal. Two household employees of Jaffer, a guard and a cook, were both sentenced to 10 years for abetting the murder. The court heard they had blocked the young woman’s attempts to leave the luxury mansion. Jaffer’s parents, who had faced charges in connection with covering up the killing, were acquitted by the court. After a lengthy trial that began in October, Judge Ata Rabbani on Thursday sentenced Jaffer to be hanged. Shaukat Ali Mukadam, Noor’s father, said the verdict was a “victory for justice” and thanked the media for keeping the matter alive. “Today, an exemplary punishment has been given to the main accused. Today, my daughter’s soul will be content to some extent. We are happy as far as the principal accused is concerned,” he told reporters outside the courtroom. Prosecution lawyer Shah Khawar said: “Justice has been served, and today’s verdict will empower Pakistani women at large. We will challenge the acquittal of his parents at the higher court.” The murder, and the efforts to protect the wealthy killer, had caused outrage in Pakistan where, despite high rates of brutal violence against women, there are low conviction rates, with most perpetrators going uncharged. According to AGHS Legal Aid Cell, a rights group providing free legal representation for marginalised groups in Pakistan, the conviction rate for cases of violence against women is less than 3%. Rights groups hailed the verdict and called for the higher courts to maintain the decision in the face of any appeal. “Justice has been served today. We demand the higher courts will maintain the sentence and dismiss Jaffer’s appeal,” said Farzana Bari, a women’s rights activist. A recent report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) said: “Violence against women and girls – including rape, murder, acid attacks, domestic violence, and forced marriage – is endemic throughout Pakistan. Human rights defenders estimate that roughly 1,000 women are killed in so-called ‘honour’ killings every year.” Jaffer, who can appeal against the verdict, was thrown out of the court several times during his trial for his behaviour, and his lawyers frequently carried him to proceedings in a wheelchair or stretcher to show he was not “mentally sound”.",News/Global development,Tycoon’s son sentenced to death in Pakistan in high-profile rape and murder case,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/24/tycoons-son-sentenced-to-death-in-pakistan-in-and-case
2/24/2022,"Rolls-Royce has announced its chief executive Warren East will stand down at the end of this year, shocking investors who wiped £1.5bn off the market value of the aero-engine maker. The 60-year old, appointed CEO in 2015 to turnaround a business beleaguered by years of scandals and a string of profit warnings, said that “this is the right moment to look to the future”.  The surprise news rattled investors, as Rolls-Royce’s board announced the start of a hunt for a successor, with shares in the company plummeting as much as 18% giving it a market value of $8.1bn. The announcement overshadowed the company’s full-year results which showed that the engine-maker has weathered the worst of the pandemic and returned to profit last year. A £124m profit for 2021 compared with a loss of £3bn in 2020, when income, derived from the hours its engines are flown by airline customers, plummeted as the travel industry was grounded at the height of the pandemic. Rolls-Royce remained cautious on its outlook for this year saying it expected to generate “modestly positive” free cash flow this year. The company said it has achieved its restructuring target of £1.3bn savings, made in part by axing 9,000 jobs, a fifth of its global workforce. “​​We have achieved the benefits of our restructuring programme a year ahead of schedule, positioning civil aerospace to capitalise on increasing international travel,” said East. “It is a privilege to lead Rolls-Royce – it’s a job which I thoroughly enjoy. There have been challenges, but we have built on the cultural and organisational improvements we have made to work through them, deliver on our commitments and create a better business.”",News/Business,Rolls-Royce share value down £1.5bn after CEO says he will quit ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/rolls-royce-share-value-down-15bn-after-ceo-warren-east-says-he-will-quit
2/24/2022,"Key workers will be literally centre stage in a new cycle of nine short plays celebrating roles that are crucial to society but often underappreciated by those in positions of power and influence. A “community cast” of 80 people aged between 16 and 96 will join professional actors on stage for The Key Workers Cycle at the Almeida theatre in north London in March.  The 30-minute plays will be performed in groups of three, with all nine plays performed on the final day of the run. They feature teachers, funeral directors, care workers, refuse collectors, midwives, delivery drivers, women’s centre workers, supermarket staff and public transport employees. The plays take inspiration from medieval mystery plays that told stories from the bible and were often performed in cycles that could last several days. Moving from town to town, the pageants drew local people into performances. Francesca Beard, who has written Face the Music: The Social Care Workers’ Play, drew on her experiences of working with All Change, a community arts programme, in a north London care home. “I’ve built relationships with care workers, the people who give us dignity at the end of our lives, people who have a great calling for caring, but are rarely honoured by society,” she said. “If we’re lucky, we will all be old one day and we’re all going to need help. We’ll be vulnerable and in need of care just as when we were children. Not having a proper conversation about this in society is madness.” Her play was akin to a tone poem, she said. “It’s about age, kindness, values, society, beauty, gracefulness – and anger. I didn’t feel I could do that naturalistically. I want people to come out with an emotional understanding of the play.” Five care workers will take part in the play – three on stage and two whose voices have been recorded – plus 10 to 12 people in their 70s, 80s and 90s who are involved in Well-Versed, All Change’s company of older people. The Full Works: The Funeral Directors’ Play was written by Josh Elliott after conversations with a local family firm. “I became fascinated by what they do, it’s so multi-skilled. They’re scientists, make-up artists, barbers, stylists and therapists,” he said. His play focuses on a veteran funeral director teaching his grandson the skills of the trade as they prepare a body for burial. “It’s the last moment of caregiving. It made me think about my own death, and it’s good to know there is someone right at the end to be there for you and your family.” Eno Mfon has written More Than We Can Bear: The Women’s Centre Workers’ Play, which emerged through conversations with workers supporting women who have experienced the criminal justice system. Mfon partnered with Clean Break, a women’s theatre company that works in prisons and in the community. Her play centres on a support worker “trying to set boundaries, to separate work from personal life, but who has a never-ending sense of responsibility,” she said. The play has “lots of different threads, strands that weave together to become a testament to these women and how important their jobs are”, said Mfon. “The play tries to acknowledge that the load we’re carrying is heavy, but we’re carrying it together.” Ten members of Clean Break appear in the play. Stephanie Bain, co-creative director of the Almeida project with Dani Parr, said: “During the dark days of the pandemic, while everything around us was uncertain and precarious, one thing emerged with clarity: that when the theatre finally reopened, we needed to find a way to celebrate those people who kept the country afloat throughout the lockdowns and who continue to keep the world running. “Now the brilliant anecdotes, the sense of humour, the stories of struggles and joys that came from writers’ conversations with key workers will be brought to life on the stage.”",Arts/Stage,Key workers to take centre stage at Almeida theatre in London,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/24/key-workers-take-centre-stage-almeida-theatre-in-london
