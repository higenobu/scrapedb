4/17/2022,"Easter traditionally marks the start of the annual housebuying season but this year there has been no need for potential sellers to mow the lawn and give the living room a lick of paint because the market’s already running hot. Demand for property has been strong ever since the UK first came out of lockdown in the summer of 2020. Mortgage approvals are up on pre-pandemic levels and prices have climbed ever higher. There are various measures of house price inflation but all of them tell the same story: annual increases in excess of 10%. According to Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, the Halifax, the price of the average UK home rose by just over £28,000 in the past year, which is pretty much the same as the average UK worker earned over the same period. Regular readers of this column will know that for some time I have been questioning how long the boom can go on and the answer appears to be longer than I anticipated. Demand for residential property continues to exceed its supply even though interest rates have started to go up and households are facing the biggest squeeze on their living standards in decades. The hit to living standards caused by prices rising faster than wages has taken its toll on consumer confidence, and that may well slow the market in the coming months. Historically, there is a close correlation between house prices and how happy consumers feel but as Holger Schmieding, the chief economist at Berenberg, has pointed out, a big gap between the two measures has emerged this year. There are structural reasons for the mismatch between housing demand and supply in the UK: this is a smallish country with relatively high population density, tight planning restrictions and a tax system that incentivises home ownership. But it is important to put things in a global context because this is not a story of British exceptionalism. In the past decade there has been a colossal global real estate boom that has doubled the value of residential property to $350tn (£268tn) – four times the size of annual world output. Plenty of attention has been paid to what has been happening to share prices but as Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research notes, the size of the US stock market (valued currently at about $45tn) is dwarfed by China’s residential property market ($100tn). The US property market is worth twice America’s annual GDP; China’s property market is worth more than five times China’s GDP. We have been here before. During the early years of the 21st century, money poured into US subprime mortgages, which became unaffordable as interest rates were raised by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. In the buildup to the global financial crisis the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter point on 17 separate occasions, taking borrowing costs from 1% to 5.25%. The housing market collapsed, leading to an abrupt shift in policy. For more than a decade, the funds to buy houses have been readily available and cheap. Weak growth and low levels of consumer price inflation have allowed central banks to keep official borrowing costs at record low levels. In times of difficulty, such as the global financial crisis and the start of the coronavirus pandemic, they have pumped money into their economies through the bond-buying process known as quantitative easing. Now central banks are under pressure because high levels of house price inflation are starting to be matched by high levels of consumer price inflation. In the US, the cost of living is up by 8.5% over the past year and in the eurozone prices have risen by 7.5%. The government’s preferred measure of the cost of living in the UK is set to rise from 7% to about 9% when the April figure is released next month. Two recent developments are making matters worse: the war in Ukraine and the draconian lockdowns being used in China to tackle Covid-19. The first is keeping energy prices high; the second is clogging up global supply chains and leading to shortages. But rising prices and the lingering pandemic are having an impact on economic activity as well as inflation. The International Monetary Fund will downgrade its growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023 in its latest world economic outlook to be published on Tuesday. Faced with the prospect of a period of stagflation, there are no good options for central banks. Brutal action of the sort used in the US at the start of the 1980s and in the UK at the end of the same decade would bring inflation down – but at a cost. At one point in the boom year of 1988, UK interest rates stood at 7.5% but little more than a year later they had been doubled to 15% and were then left there for a further 12 months. The upshot was record bankruptcies, record home repossessions and unemployment above 3 million. House prices crashed and continued falling in real terms until the mid-1990s. Since growth is moderating anyway, a different approach will be tried. The plan is to raise interest rates gradually and modestly, in the hope that inflation will come back to its target without crashing the economy. There is no guarantee this will work either, and it is worth noting that even a modest increase in market interest rates in the US since the turn of the year has resulted in a softening of demand for mortgages. And that has been happening at a time when interest rates are substantially negative in real (inflation-adjusted) terms. What does all this mean? It means policymakers in London, Washington, Frankfurt and (especially) Beijing are right to be nervous. Subprime was the bubble to end all bubbles.

4/17/2022,"The president of the European Commission has urged member states to supply Ukraine with weapons systems “quickly” and suggested that a next round of EU sanctions could target Russia’s powerful Sberbank and include an embargo on Russian oil. “It applies to all member states: those who can should deliver quickly, because only that way Ukraine can survive in its acute defensive battle against Russia,” Ursula von der Leyen told Germany’s Bild am Sonntag newspaper. Several European nations appear to be vacillating over the export of heavy weapons such as tanks or fighter jets, amid concerns that such a move could formally escalate the war in Ukraine into a direct conflict between Russia and Nato member states. In a formal diplomatic note sent to Washington last week, Moscow warned that Nato shipments of “most sensitive” weapons systems could bring “unpredictable consequences”. Von der Leyen urged European leaders not to delay decisions “over category differences”. “I don’t distinguish between heavy and light weapons,” she said. “Ukraine has to get whatever it needs to defend itself and what it can handle.” In his nightly video address to the nation on Saturday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy reiterated that Ukraine needed more material support from the west to have a chance at saving the besieged city of Mariupol. “Either our partners give Ukraine all of the necessary heavy weapons, the planes, and, without exaggeration, immediately, so we can reduce the pressure of the occupiers on Mariupol and break the blockade,” he said, “or we do so through negotiations, in which the role of our partners should be decisive.” In her interview with Bild am Sonntag, Von der Leyen said the citizens of European should mentally prepare themselves for a long military conflict in Ukraine. “We have to do everything to make it end as soon as possible,” the German politician said. “And at the same time we have to prepare for the fact that the war could at worst go on for months, maybe years.” On the EU’s sixth sanctions package, which is currently being prepared in Brussels, Von der Leyen said: “We are continuing to look at the banking sector, especially Sberbank, which alone makes up 37% of the Russian banking sector. And of course we are dealing with energy questions.” The EU has so far spared Sberbank because it, along with Gazprombank, is one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas. The commission president said reducing Putin’s financial gains had to be a priority. “Oil is being traded globally,” she said. “What must not happen is that Putin is getting even higher returns on other markets for deliveries that would otherwise go to the EU. Therefore we are currently developing clever mechanisms so that the next level of sanctions can also include oil.”",News/World news,EU chief urges member states to give Ukraine weapons quickly,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/17/eu-chief-urges-member-states-to-give-ukraine-weapons-quickly
4/17/2022,"The heroes of British intelligence embark on a fraught mission of exposition in John Madden’s garrulous account of a hush-hush, top-secret allied plot to beat Hitler. They’re outlining the idea inside smoke-filled admiralty offices, road-testing the scheme in crowded dance halls and pubs, noisily chewing over the difficulties of planting false papers on a corpse. The secretaries are talking to the agents, the agents to the admiral, the admiral to Winston Churchill while strolling in the garden at No 10. The only fellow not talking, thank goodness, is the corpse. Adapted from the bestselling book by Ben Macintyre, Operation Mincemeat crashlands in cinemas as a stolid, Blimpish wartime thriller, adorned with epaulettes and brass buttons, eyeglasses and moustaches. Colin Firth plays stiff-backed Ewen Montagu, the MI5 agent who hatches a scheme to divert Nazi forces from the shores of Sicily and thereby lay the ground for a full-scale invasion of the continent. Montagu requires a dead body as decoy, a wily co-conspirator (Matthew Macfadyen) and an office romance (Kelly Macdonald), though possibly not in that order. But the clock is ticking and the subterfuge is contagious. The longer the agents spend concocting their cover story, the more real it becomes until nobody is sure who’s in love with which person, and who’s a spy and who’s not. A quality cast tackle the script’s various twists and turns with aplomb. But the tale itself feels cumbersome and over-furnished, listing under the weight of its bolt-on subplots and endless reams of dialogue. The young Ian Fleming, we’re told, was one of the agents who helped devise Operation Mincemeat. At intervals, Madden’s camera catches him lounging in the corner, tapping away at his typewriter; a semi-detached player in this particular plot, already dreaming of bigger, better things.",Arts/Film,Operation Mincemeat review – Blimpish take on Ben Macintyre’s spy thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/17/operation-mincemeat-review-colin-firth-matthew-macfadyen-kelly-macdonald
4/17/2022,"The woodlands at Blickling are carefully managed through the winter months to ensure plenty of sunlight reaches the ground, producing a glorious show of bluebells in late April and early May across the Great Wood, under the towering plane trees and along Temple Walk. The estate stretches over 4,600 acres offering wonderful, dog-friendly walks, as well as cycle hire (including e-bikes and trailers), and fishing in the summer months. The nearby Buckinghamshire Arms is a cosy, 17th-century coaching inn offering classic pub dishes (bucksarms.co.uk).nationaltrust.org.uk It might sound unlikely, but this spectacular wooded landscape was once referred to as “Little Switzerland”, thanks to the steep-sided, lush valley, bisected by pathways, rivers and streams. In spring, the woodland floor is a carpet of vivid blue, with waymarked trails winding between the thousands of bluebells shimmering beneath the lush foliage, which make Hardcastle an Instagrammer’s dream. Visit in late April or early May, before the full woodland canopy has opened and there are still pockets of sunlight. Afterwards, head to nearby Hebden Bridge for lunch at the Old Gate, a buzzy bar and restaurant specialising in local seasonal produce (oldgatehebden.co.uk).nationaltrust.org.uk This vast estate combines imposing glens and mountains, glittering rivers and the Woodland Trust’s largest woods, with Scotland’s biggest collection of ancient trees rising up above a sea of bluebells during the spring months.

4/17/2022,"With acting roles hard to come by, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are now starring in a legal drama about the collapse of their volatile marriage. The script is ugly, the walk-on parts unpredictable, and the lighting harsh. Claims and counter-claims of domestic abuse, manipulation, obsession, drug addiction and alcoholism inform the duelling defamation lawsuits being tested in a Fairfax, Virginia, courtroom. Depp and Heard, who were married for just three years, still know how to put on a show even if they are sitting 15ft apart, separated by lawyers and a deep expanse of resentment. Depp’s $50m action against Heard, whom Depp claims libelled him in 2018 by writing an opinion article in the Washington Post that he believes falsely portrayed him as a domestic abuser, has signalled that the actor, effectively blacklisted by Hollywood, believes he has little left to lose. Depp, 58, has accused Heard, 35, of making allegations of domestic abuse against him “designed to shock” and to “manipulate” the #MeToo movement. Jurors have heard that she initiated the fights. In a $100m countersuit, Heard’s attorneys claim that Depp is an “obsessed ex-husband hellbent on revenge”, who punched, kicked and sexually assaulted his wife with a vodka bottle. The Kentucky-born actor lost one defamation trial against the Sun newspaper last year when a British high court judge ruled that it was “substantially true” that Depp beat his Texas-born ex-wife. But the US sequel to the London action is perceptibly different in character. Hollywood has come to the Virginia suburbs. Fans, mostly of Depp, are permitted in the courtroom and the proceedings are being livestreamed to millions. In addition to the plaintiff and defendant – Depp and Heard – James Franco, Paul Bettany and Elon Musk are on Judge Penney Azcarate’s list to testify. They will join employees, friends, doctors and psychotherapists who have superimposed a Hollywood make-believe quality on Azcarate’s courtroom. Heard has maintained an air of cool composure against daily assaults on her character and motivations. Depp, too, has presented himself strategically. On the second day of the trial, after a series of witnesses accused him of behaving aggressively, Kate James, Heard’s assistant from 2012 to 2015, described the actor as “a total Southern gentleman”. One week into what is scheduled to be a seven-week trial, Depp’s presentation of witnesses to support his libel claim is merely setting the stage for his testimony later on. That depends if the actor can plausibly present his former wife as schemer, and not, as she contends, a victim of his abuse. Heard’s alleged libel, his representatives say, “follows a pattern of her elaborate, erroneous claims which have continued to change and evolve over time for the purpose of Hollywood shock value of which Amber has mastered and used to exploit a serious social movement”. Both parties would have had to agree to waive privacy rights for relationship counsellor Dr Laurel Anderson to testify that both Heard and Depp had family histories of domestic violence. Depp had been “well controlled” for decades before meeting Heard, Anderson said. “With Ms Heard, he was triggered. They engaged in what I saw as mutual abuse.” On more than one occasion, she said, Heard had initiated incidents to stop Depp leaving, stemming from her fear of abandonment. “It was a point of pride to Heard, if she felt disrespected, to initiate a fight. If he was going to leave her to de-escalate a fight, she would strike him to keep him there. She would rather be in a fight to keep him there.” Depp’s legal strategy, say US libel lawyers, has been to show vulnerability. “Clearly these two individuals brought what sounds like baggage to the marriage. So the strategy is not to gain sympathy but to show the jury what is more likely – that she’s the abuser or he is,” said New York libel lawyer Kimberly Lau. Establishing that Depp was provoked does not in itself provide a defence to abuse. “Depp has to combat allegations that he is the abuser in order for the statements to be false,” Lau said. “Establishing provocation could help to undermine the credibility of the other party.” At some point before Heard has an opportunity to present her side of the story to the jury, Depp will take the stand. “Amber Heard is not the star of this drama, though she might like to be,” said Hollywood lawyer and commentator Allison Hope Weiner. “When he goes on the stand, it’s him. It’s going to be a hard act to follow. He’s going to be very likable. “Those movie stars are professionally charming, and even when you steel yourself against liking them, when they want you to like them, you like them.”",Arts/Film,Depp v Heard sequel turns Hollywood drama as actors prepare to take stage,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/17/depp-v-heard-sequel-turns-hollywood-drama-as-actors-prepare-to-take-stage
4/17/2022,"Jesus Ramirez has spent years searching for housing he can afford in Fresno, California. He jokes that he’ll remain on the streets until he’s old enough for a retirement home. For the last two years, the 47-year-old spent most nights sleeping in front of closed businesses in the heart of California’s Central Valley. Diagnosed with schizophrenia, he receives $950 a month in government assistance, but he hasn’t been able to find a place in his budget in Fresno, which had the greatest rent increases of any US city last year. “I’ve tried,” he said. “But at this point if I haven’t found one of those apartments where it’s based off your income and your mental health, chances are I’m not going to find one.” Ramirez lost his housing at a time when California’s homeless population surged dramatically amid the pandemic, prompting the state to invest billions in housing and related services to address the longstanding crisis. Fresno, the state’s fifth-largest city and one of its most affordable, saw a substantial rise; the number of unhoused people climbed from 1,486 individuals in 2019 to an estimated 4,239 in 2021, according to city data that both officials and advocates acknowledge is likely an undercount. Local officials had once considered Fresno a success story – by its own count the city managed to reduce homelessness by nearly 60% between 2011 and 2017, the largest decrease anywhere on the west coast – but numbers started climbing again even before the pandemic. In 2019, Fresno had a higher rate of people living on the streets than any other major city in the US. Now as rents continue to rise, pushing Fresno’s poorest residents into substandard housing or forcing them to leave the area entirely, homelessness in the city has reached unprecedented levels. Officials have said they’re doing everything they can to find solutions, using state and federal funds to expand housing options, but advocates question the city’s approach and argue that Fresno’s leaders are failing to enact policies that will prevent the crisis from worsening. “We’re not seeing the urgency that these types of issues merit,” said Grecia Elenes, a policy advocate with the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, a Central Valley-based advocacy organization. “Almost weekly, without fail, we have a new statistic about how unaffordable the city is, how people born here cannot stay and how they’re stuck living in horrible conditions.” Fresno has historically been one of the most affordable places to live in California, and among the most diverse cities in the US, but it’s also one of the poorest. Rising rent prices amid a statewide housing crunch that’s pushing more and more Californians to cities in the agricultural Central Valley, stagnant wages and a shortfall of nearly 40,000 affordable housing units, part of a vast shortage, have made it even more difficult for unhoused residents such as Ramirez to find their footing. “There has not been construction of new, affordable housing and rental units that could ever accommodate the growing city,” said Jim Grant, the retired director of the social justice ministry at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno. “We are half a million people, and we do not have living conditions worthy of half a million people.” Ramirez has been unsuccessfully trying to obtain housing through local programs that offer subsidized rent based on income and mental health issues. He wants to work, but he has been without the medication he needs for his schizophrenia for more than a year, making it difficult to report to a job. Instead, he uses his limited income for food and a gym membership so he can shower, work out and charge his phone. He knows how to live on the streets by now – he wears clothes that dry quickly and shoes that he can resole and carries a shower curtain to sleep on as it keeps away mold better than a tarp. Ramirez would like to find a room somewhere, but he has no hope that will ever happen, and he believes he will be unhoused for most of his life. “I don’t mind sleeping on the floor. I don’t need a [whole] apartment, or an extra spare bedroom for a gaming system,” he said. “I’m OK with the fact, the knowledge, that I’m going to be homeless until I’m old enough to get into a retirement home.” For the last month, Ramirez has stayed in a room in one of the motels the city has converted into temporary housing for those living on the streets, but he is unsure how long that arrangement will last. The city’s current approach to addressing homelessness involved providing shelter at the converted motels, investing funding in services to reduce the number of people becoming homeless, and a new response team, said H Spees, the city’s housing and homeless initiatives director. The affordable housing shortage, coupled with rising rent prices, had exacerbated homelessness in Fresno, Spees said, but the rise was not unique to the city. It was the consequence of “multiple system breakdowns in society” that include everything from domestic violence to mental health to addiction. “We understand it’s not just a Fresno problem. It’s a national problem,” Spees said. “[The] mayor and our community sees homelessness as the number one issue. If we don’t address homelessness, there is a sense we will lose the soul of our city.” The city was making progress, he argued. Fresno had removed encampments from its freeways, providing housing to those who lived there, Spees said, and launched a homeless response team that works directly with unsheltered residents to connect them to resources. But advocates argue Fresno’s efforts amount to far too little, upholding the status quo and failing to provide true support and dignity to unsheltered people. Many who work directly with unsheltered people, such as Dez Martinez, an advocate who spent several years living on the streets of Fresno, question the city’s data and have doubts it ever made the strides in reducing homelessness officials say it has. “It’s so overwhelming,” Martinez said. “During Covid, the number skyrocketed, but in my time being out there on the streets, I’ve seen nothing but a rise every single year.” Martinez spends her days advocating for what she refers to as “the street family” through her own non-profits and roles on various committees, and visiting encampments and the converted motels where everyone knows her by name. A recent incident at one motel highlighted everything wrong with the city’s approach, she said. During the visit, tensions rose when police responding to a call sought to question an emotionally distraught man. He grew increasingly upset as two officers surrounded him, which compelled Martinez and another motel resident to step in to de-escalate the situation despite the protests of the officers. The pair were able to calm the man down when officers and EMTs could not, and eventually the officers left. “If I wasn’t there, and if we couldn’t de-escalate and get the other street family members around, they would have all tackled [him]. It would have been ugly,” Martinez said. “You have to treat people like they’re human.” Programs such as the new homeless response team weren’t helping to foster a more humane approach, she continued. City leaders have hailed the new team, which is also responsible for clearing encampments and connecting residents to housing. Martinez and others are critical, particularly because of a new city law establishing a $250 fine for advocates who enter encampments officials are trying to clear. Martinez said the law showed that Fresno doesn’t actually want to work with advocates like her. The ACLU has sued the city over the law, calling it “outrageously broad” and an assault on advocates’ constitutional rights. People need housing and wrap-around services such as job placements and mental health treatment, Martinez said. Advocates also hope to see the city implement rent stabilization, right to counsel and fair chance housing, policies recommended by a consultant hired by the city. “The city is just having these Band-Aid solutions to solve the housing crisis,” said Karla Martinez, a policy advocate with the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability. “They’re purchasing motels, but not providing preventative solutions to prevent people from becoming houseless in the first place.” “It’s always been a crisis,” said Janine Nkosi, an advocate with Faith in the Valley, a community organization that advocates for safe and affordable housing. “It just doesn’t have to be this way.” Rent stabilization and stronger protections against eviction would help prevent more people from losing their housing in the first place, advocates argue – something Dez Martinez has seen personally. She’s been housed for several years but is facing an eviction after a dispute with her landlord, who she says has failed to provide safe housing. Though she’s found another place to live, the incident serves as a reminder of how easy it is to lose one’s home. “What about everybody else that doesn’t have the connections that I have made?” she said. “We need to think about the people that are being evicted. Once you’re out here, it’s the hardest thing to get out of the streets.”",News/US news,How the homelessness crisis hit one of California’s most affordable cities,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/17/homelessness-california-fresno
4/17/2022,"Sian Clifford is not Claire from Fleabag. I mean, she is: over Zoom, even with her glasses on in quite un-Claire hoop earrings, she’s instantly recognisable as the older sister, that seething ball of duty, ambition, suppressed rage and barely acknowledged love. I’m assuming here that you’ve watched Fleabag, or at least know of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s multi-award-winning, juggernaut tragi-comedy of lust, grief, family and feeling lost. Even if you spent the past six years under a rock, you would have struggled to miss the “hair is everything” scene, where Claire’s steely facade is breached by a ferociously asymmetric bob that makes her look “like a pencil”. It struck a deep chord in British womanhood (and far beyond), but there are other bits of Claire I love more: the glitter of happiness when she says working in Finland is “cold and beautiful and dark”. The tense glances, the flashes of anger, amusement and affection that flit across her face, controlled but so close to the edge. Her statement, “I take all the negative emotions; I bottle them and bury them and they never come out. I’ve basically never been better.” She’s perfect. Clifford’s 2020 Bafta win – female performance in a comedy – came as a surprise to no one but her (in her acceptance speech, she looks genuinely shellshocked). But speaking from her mum’s house, on a day of “life admin” before she flies to Bulgaria on a new work project, Clifford is far gentler than Claire: thoughtful, expansive with love and praise for her projects and partners, and possibly a touch new age-y. She describes a recent shoot as “aligned and auspicious and very magical” (imagine Claire’s face). She does yoga and meditates; she was creating Still Space, a mindfulness platform, before Fleabag went stratospheric. I know: “actor is good at acting” is no scoop. But Claire was so seething with humanity, and Clifford embodied her so completely, it’s momentarily surprising. Perhaps she’s doomed to have idiots like me mistake her for Claire for the rest of her career – there are worse legacies – but I doubt it. We’re here to talk about the new BBC adaptation of Kate Atkinson’s Costa-winning novel Life After Life. With a script by award-winning playwright Bash Doran, directed by John Crowley (director of Brooklyn and The Goldfinch), it’s the story – or rather the many stories – of Ursula Todd. In it, we see many different possible versions of Ursula’s life: her multiple births, deaths and destinies, starting in 1910 and spanning both wars. It’s an exploration, really, of the turning points that shape a life. Clifford plays Sylvie, Ursula’s mother, another tight but fraying knot of feeling, struggling to understand and love her troubled daughter (beautifully played by Thomasin McKenzie); hidebound by her Edwardian sensibilities. It’s haunting, and Clifford is wonderful in it: by turn luminous with love, hollow with grief and confrontingly harsh (“coldness, severity, despair, betrayal and disgust”, she lists, discussing one scene). “Her internal conflict is a minefield,” says Clifford, who describes Sylvie as “wrestling with her own womanhood”. “I think she’s so complex.” The repeating-timelines structure of Life After Life, she says, offered a special opportunity for an actor: “It’s extraordinary that I got to play scenes out that were the same scene in a completely different life. I got to live the ‘what if’. You get so many facets of that diamond.” You gave birth a lot, too, I say, admiringly (she makes it look properly frightening), as we watch Ursula’s many lives play out, we see Sylvie go through labour again and again. “I did!” she agrees. “It was life-changing actually performing those scenes and demanded more courage from me than I’ve ever had to call on before in a role.” Each birth is different. Given the premise of the story, I don’t think it’s a spoiler to say baby Ursula is stillborn in one of her lifelines – it’s slow and hard to watch. “It was incredibly upsetting. John didn’t tell me we were just going to keep rolling,” she says of that scene. “I just had to keep going, because they weren’t calling ‘cut’.” With war and a pandemic central to the story, Life After Life feels timely. It was shot over a tight two months in the spring of 2021: “Everyone was masked and visored,” Clifford says, “and there were children dying of influenza [in the story], so it felt very pertinent.” More philosophically, that question of what you would do if you could have your life again; of whether we learn from mistakes is perennially fascinating. Did it make her interrogate her own life? “I think about stuff like that every day. This was just petrol on a fire,” she says. “They talk a lot about instinct in the show: to me it’s intuition. Intuition is something more spiritual – it’s that deep knowing. I experience it a lot in my life and the more I tune into that part of myself, the better my life becomes.” That “deep knowing” started early: Clifford joined a theatre group at six then gave up; her sister Natalie, now an art dealer in the US, continued. (“It’s funny,” she says, “I would say my sister is the performer in the family; I’m much more introverted.”) Watching Natalie’s next performance, “I had a knowing that I was meant to be there and not here.” Theatre became an escape from school, which she says hated, though hugely supportive drama teachers helped. One, Mr Rust-Williams (she repeats it for me, hand on heart), let her into the second audition for Little Shop of Horrors when she wimped out of the first, then regretted it. She sang her heart out through her nerves (“a bit of a High School Musical moment”) and got a part. I track down Rust-Williams who says she was, “A delight to teach, very dedicated, driven and good-humoured,” though he claims she “never really forgave him” for the beehive his hairdresser mum gave her for the show. “It took days for her to brush out the back combing!” Her successful audition was one of those crystallising, turning-point moments when her life could have gone a very different way, she says: “My path became very clear.” The next came when she failed to get into Rada twice, but persisted, making it on the third attempt. I wonder what her parents thought: she says she feels privileged that they were “Never anything but enthusiastic – it was never a question or a doubt.” That third time lucky was extra lucky of course: “That was also the year that Phoebe Waller-Bridge got in, too. If I’d been in the previous year, we might never have met.” They got to know each other on their third day at Rada, sharing a 45-minute tube ride back to Ealing, where they both grew up. That swiftly formed friendship, was, she says, “A profound connection that I think we both took for granted at the time because we were so young.” Was there also an instant professional spark? “We were definitely huge supporters of each other’s work. Certainly, when we graduated and had to deal with the real-life hustle of the professional world, I became conscious of what a huge champion of me she was.” Post-graduation life went well for Clifford, initially, with stints at Bristol Old Vic and the Barbican. “I did some nice theatre jobs, I felt like I was climbing the ladder.” But there were also, “periods of not working and not knowing what to do and temping”. When Fleabag started production, Clifford hadn’t worked as an actor for two years, other than with Waller-Bridge. “I started to dabble in production. I loved the creative control and I’m very good with a spreadsheet.” (I enjoy this touch of Claire-ness.) If sounds as if her intuition faltered momentarily at this point: another fork in the road. “I remember there was a moment where Phoebe said, ‘Well you have to do Fleabag,’ and I was quite nonchalant about it because, to be honest, I didn’t think they would have me.” That was grounded in “other disappointments. I didn’t want to get my hopes up really. Up to that point, Phoebe was making other things and I hadn’t been able to be involved, because directors or producers didn’t want to hire me.” There was “a tussle” to get the part of Claire – a part she had been playing since 2009 in sketch form and that Waller-Bridge had written specifically for her. They had talked about playing sisters for years, she says. “Both Phoebe and I have a sister and we do both consider each other a sister, we fell into those roles very easily. It was really organic… I hate that word.” “You’ve got an actor you know can do that and is sitting on it and you just need to give them the right tools,” Waller-Bridge has said of Clifford’s part in the project; she held out for her friend. “We always said whoever gets there first, I’m dragging you with me,” Clifford says of their partnership. She couldn’t quite allow herself to believe the part was hers until she was on set. “I didn’t want to remember how much I loved acting, actually, until it was real and tangible.” Once she felt safe to enjoy it, Fleabag was “the time of my life”. “I never thought I’d have an experience as collaborative and creatively fulfilling as Fleabag,” she says, when we’re talking about Life After Life (which did). After the first season aired, improbably, Clifford did not work for a year. But in 2017 she got a part in Brandon Jacobs-Jenkins’s well-reviewed Gloria at the Hampstead Theatre and “Since then, touch wood, I haven’t stopped.” If anything, Covid made her busier. “I’ve flung myself into the whirlwind,” she says. The pipeline includes See How They Run, a murder romp with Saoirse Ronan and Sam Rockwell, among other luminaries, and the semi-improvised “really fun, very silly” Real Love with Russell Tovey, a friend since teen theatre days (“We were in Wales, Russell and I were living in a cottage for a week, he’d build fires for me in the evening.”). A huge fan of His Dark Materials (“I love fantasy, that’s the little nerd in me”), she will fulfil a dream and join the cast when it returns to the screen in the autumn. “I basically chewed someone’s arm off for a part; that was a full-year endeavour.” There’s new work with Waller-Bridge in the offing, too: “We’re both horribly excited about it.” I need to know: why is she so good at getting under the skin of tightly wound women when she seems so serene? She was wonderful as Diana Ingram, too, wife of the “cheating major” in Stephen Frears’s Quiz, the story of the Who Wants to be a Millionaire? scandal. “I feel those women are completely different,” she says, carefully. “But there is a core of them that is tightly wound and it unleashes. The way it unleashes manifests very differently. I feel very comfortable in that space,” she muses. “I don’t know what that says about me.” Still thinking, she says it’s not the uptightness that appeals, so much as the complexity and the conflict. “Their humanity leaps off the page, that’s what makes me go crazy for a part. That’s what I want to bring to life in spite of any hard edges, asperity – I know there is a real human being that I can find compassion for and I would like other people to as well. I want parts that make me the most elastic and expanded, not just actor, but human being I can be,” she says, warming to the theme. That’s what those roles gave her: “I got to stretch into different places.” Surely she’s a tiny bit Claire, Sylvie, Diana though. She certainly won’t tell me if she’s turning 40 the week we speak, as the internet suggests (we compromise on me asking how she feels about a new decade if, hypothetically, she happens to be facing one: “Very, very happy with where I am” is the answer). “That is me, too, I have that in me, but I’ve done a lot of work on myself to soften the grip, to be more accepting of where I am in any given moment. The philosophical part of me has softened those edges, that’s for sure.” “There are plenty of edge softeners in her life, I think. She lives in south London with her lockdown dog: “She’s a rescue pup, she’s awesome.” She’s working her way through Rachel Cusk’s Outline trilogy – “I find her writing transcendent, like oxygen” – but is also obsessed with cooking shows. She prefers to watch than cook, she says and has just devoured all of Great British Menu – “Some people go really off brief,” she says, delightedly. She watches the gentle comedy Schitt’s Creek (the anti-Fleabag, surely) on a loop for comfort. “You know Netflix just autoplays, so when you get to the end, it plays that lovely little documentary, then it just starts again? I have watched all the way through eight or nine times.” Who’s her favourite? “Catherine O’Hara is my queen. I’m obsessed and endlessly fascinated by her and her choices. She’s my inspiration.” They were supposed to work together; it fell through but the dream persists. “Definitely, I’m putting that out into the universe.” Here’s hoping we’re on the timeline where that happens.

4/17/2022,"Near-future dystopian debuts have been quite the thing over the past 12 months – see Oona Aristide’s Under the Blue and Kate Sawyer’s The Stranding. Tom Watson’s evocative first novel follows suit. Aina and Witney have been living in a dilapidated croft on a windswept island for 12 long years. She’s a musician, he’s a sculptor and his figures dominate the landscape. Their exile is a punishment for having had an illicit child after being denied permission by the state. The pair are bound to the croft by a clock that dispenses pills every eight hours. It serves as their “leash. A constant metronome, ticking away, keeping them in check.” They’ve been told that melting ice has affected the permafrost, “releasing spumes of toxic bacteria”, so they have to take the pills for their own survival. But when a sheep appears outside their home, Aina starts to question whether they really are marooned on an island. Aina yearns to be reunited with her son, Maxime, now a young adult, and anxiously awaits the return of the Warden and their parole, but no one arrives to collect them. As the days stretch into weeks, Aina looks back at her life with Witney and what once united them. She begins to doubt that they will be freed and thinks of ways to escape, whereas Witney believes they are being tested. When their convictions begin to fracture, so does their mutual trust. Watson is strong on atmosphere, creating a suitably bleak landscape, and his exploration of resilience, grief and the human instinct for survival is perceptive. But, as the threat of aggression simmers away, when violence finally erupts, it feels gratuitous and, at times, Metronome reads like a checklist for dystopian fiction – the protagonists are punished by an oppressive government, survive environmental catastrophe and are controlled by a remote technology – without offering anything particularly new. Nevertheless, this is a bold debut and Watson is a writer to watch.  Metronome by Tom Watson is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99).

4/17/2022,"On a picturesque island just a 30-minute ferry ride from downtown Seattle, Juanita Perez described losing a recent race for a delegate seat for the Tlingit and Haida tribes: “I didn’t have all the tools to do it the right way,” she said. It was a recent weekend in April and the third day of an advocacy boot camp put on by the Native Action Network, a non-profit in Seattle, Washington. She was sitting in a circle of more than a dozen Native women going over the challenges of running for office as a Native woman and the political positions they were each interested in pursuing. The event, a first for the organization, was designed to help more “Native womxn” run for office at every level. The 20 participants from 17 different tribes had traveled to the meeting space from across Washington state and Oregon. There was a PhD student, a school district board member, a child advocate, a Native American education liaison, real estate brokers and an undergraduate student. Some, like Perez, had already tried their hand in the political realm, while others were still getting acquainted with the prospect. But each one had put their life on hold as they explored the idea of taking a seat at the decision-making table that too often leaves out Native women. And in the process, they had each found a loyal support system in each other. In 2020, the Center for American Women and Politics, which has tracked female political candidacies for 30 years, identified a record 18 women who identified as Native American as running for US congressional seats, with two winning in the House. The center’s figures don’t include Yvette Herrell, who is a member of the Cherokee nation and was elected to the House. The following year, Representative Deb Haaland, an enrolled member of the Pueblo of Laguna, became the first Indigenous cabinet secretary in US history. But American Indian or Alaska Native women account for 1.1% of the population, and yet they, in combination with Native Hawaiian women, still make up just 0.2% of all voting members of Congress. In other words, they continue to be largely left out of the decision-making at the highest levels of the country, despite the fact, as Leah Salgado, chief impact officer for the Native women-led organization IllumiNative, explained it, that their “very existence is a political issue”. Now, as the country heads into the midterm elections, the bootcamp is meant to build on the momentum of past years by creating a space that, unlike many other campaign trainings, was Native specific, said Iris Friday, president and co-founder of Native Action Network. “It makes all the difference when you get all of these women in the room and they have a safe space where they can have open, honest conversations and dialogues,” she said. “It’s just so powerful to see what transpires at the end of the day.” There appear to be nine women who identify as Native American running for US congressional seats in the upcoming elections, said Kelly Dittmar, director of research for the Center for American women and politics, the second highest number to date. That number could still increase, as more than 100 women have registered their candidacy without stipulating their race. Salgado said it’s important to understand the historical context surrounding Native people and the country’s political system. Native people were not granted citizenship in the US until 1924, and then it took more than three decades before they were considered eligible to vote in every state. “Native people stepping into a place where we’re training and putting forth efforts to ensure Native people have access to the political process is necessary and important because we haven’t always had access to it,” she said. Although still fairly rare, she said she has noticed a slight increase in training sessions like this one. But, she said, getting Native women into leadership roles is just one step. It’s also about helping them once they are there. “It also has to be about what are the ways in which we’re making sure that they’re supported through all of this because you don’t get elected and then the racism stops,” she said. In a series of detailed sessions, the boot camp participants were taught about fundraising, Pacs, communication styles and crafting their individual message. They heard from the Washington state senator Mona Das, a Democrat, and the Suquamish Tribe council member Windy Anderson. On Saturday morning, a professional photographer took their headshots. By Sunday, their bags were full of such books as Lead from the Outside by Stacey Abrams and Run for Something by Amanda Litman. Each day the women sat along long wooden tables, sharing meals together. There were spontaneous discussions on Indigenous language revitalization and blood quantum. In the evenings they stayed together in nearby lodges. In the following months, they will have at least three additional training sessions, including one on public speaking in July. Lafaitele Faitalia, 38, who is Tongan and Samoan, is considering a run for the Washington state house. The training taught her about bringing her authentic self, she said, while at the same time it helped her understand Pacs and the daunting prospect of fundraising. “If you’re not exposed to the political systems in the US; if you don’t know what that looks like, [or about] navigating these systems, but you want to make change and you want to run for office, it’s going to be intimidating,” said Faitalia, who is a chief in Samoa and serves on Washington state’s commission on Asian Pacific American affairs. Lisa Young, 59, who is Tlingit and Navajo, has spent 15 years working as a finance director for city government, but is now considering a campaign for city council in her small home town of Redmond, Oregon. She said she wants to give a voice to its small Native population, along with its other minorities, as well as immigrants. “[Being] here allowed me to re-energize and say I can be that person of service even though I know there’s going to be barriers,” she said. “I think these women strengthened me a little bit. Enough to say, OK, I’m less afraid today than I was before.” Claudia Kauffman, vice-president and co-founder of Native Action Network, is very familiar with what it’s like running for political office as a Native woman. In 2007, she was sworn in as the first Native woman elected to the Washington state senate. But, she said, it was a moment more than 25 years ago, when she was working for the Indigenous activist Bernie Whitebear, that helped to spur her to run. They were at the state capitol in Olympia, meeting with lawmakers to try to get funding for afterschool programming for Native children. “They’re just people just like you and me,” he told her. She remembers thinking, “If they’re just people, then why not me?” Now, through this advocacy boot camp, she is trying to have a similar impact on these Native women, no matter what type of position they may be seeking. “Our job, our duty, is to cultivate future leaders, the next generation of leaders that we have within our community that we know are strong and resilient and committed,” she said. By the third day of the training, when organizers asked the group whether they were inspired to run for office, six women raised their hands, with two others saying they wanted to explore getting seats on boards and commissions. Perhaps just as important was how quickly the women had become each other’s steadfast supporters. On that final day of the bootcamp, when Perez described losing the race, within seconds participants responded with messages of support. One encouraged her to go bigger if her tribal community wasn’t receptive to her. Another said she had connections at the tribe, and offered to help. Then a third told her: “You’re not alone.”",News/US news,‘Why not me?’: the boot camp giving Indigenous women the tools to run for office,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/17/indigenous-women-congress-native-action-network
4/17/2022,"Suddenly, theatre is firing on its newest cylinders. Immersive ingenuity, political fantasy, choreography that stretches the vocabulary of the stage. Coventry, currently the UK city of culture, is the real star of The Great Middlemarch Mystery. Josephine Burton and Ruth Livesey’s Dash Arts adaptation of George Eliot’s novel, which Burton directs, moves the action from the 1830s to the 1980s and sets it in a series of 18th-century buildings near the city centre. The audience piece together the plot by running after characters as they move around the cobbled streets. At one end of the town hall, firebrand Will Ladislaw is promoting his radical newspaper; at the other, women gather for a sewing bee. In Mr Bulstrode’s bank – polished wood and carriage clocks – dodgy money is changing hands. In the bar at the Green Dragon, a bearded villain slumps drunk in an armchair. This is truly site-specific theatre, not only because it takes place in the city that (probably) inspired Eliot’s novel. The production’s melding of past and present echo Coventry’s individual way of honouring its history, with the ruins of the bombed cathedral left alongside the postwar building. Not all is clear or smooth; the acting – some of it, suitably, by Coventry residents – comes and goes. At first, elements of the adaptation seem gaspworthy: there is no Dorothea Brooke, no absolute heroine. Yet the novel’s dynamic and much of its detail are captured; a flyer advertising “the Casaubon Foundation” is left casually on a side table. Change is in the air as it was for Eliot, with disruption in the world of finance – and the outbreak of a life-threatening disease. As are ideas of what middle England can be. The justified impatience and ridiculous snobbery of the outsider is nicely caught in the person of the visionary doctor with mobile eyebrows and a jacket just slightly too big for his frame (as he is for his boots). Here is the dispiriting life of women with nothing to do but hope for upward mobility and more puffed sleeves; here is the inspiring independence of radicals. Vitally, by making spectators forge their own links between sites, stories, factions and families, The Great Middlemarch Mystery goes to the core of Eliot’s project: to show life not as singular destiny but part of an infinitely complicated web. Political theatre is reaching – it needs to – for more hallucinatory realism. Think of Lucy Prebble’s brilliant 2019 attack on Putin in A Very Expensive Poison, with its giant puppets, its massive gold phallus, its roaring anger. Think of Mike Bartlett’s 2014 reimagining of the state of Britain in King Charles III. In The 47th, Bartlett turns his attention to the United States, once again ratcheting up his language with blank verse, and casting giant shadows over the action with echoes of Shakespearean tragedy: King Lear’s division of his kingdom; sleepwalking from Macbeth; the galvanic cockiness of Richard III. His new play, not quite analysis and not quite prediction, has less imaginative force than his earlier satire: though set in the future, it does not so much jump forward as stamp wildly on the spot, rerunning recent events. Yet the Trump years have a grisly fascination: they are so nearly incredible. Rupert Goold’s production crackles. There is a new president – not quite who and not quite how you might think. Miriam Buether’s design is aptly sleek, but fires, riots and horned headdresses are spreading across the country; the storming of the Capitol looks less like an isolated act than the pattern for the future. Bertie Carvel’s Trump is alone worth the price of a ticket: not so much an impersonation as a reincarnation, as if Carvel himself has completely vanished and in his place something that seems barely human – a wax model perhaps – has been given palpable life. He is funny from the moment he gets out of the golf buggy on which he arrives, and scratches his crack; he is frightening as he moves from tease to power-fuelled taunt. He is altogether both eerie and plausible, with the ex-pres’s singular combination of fleshy swagger and doll-like dainty flinches – as if his features have been jetted on to the unsuspecting blank of his face. Tamara Tunie brings terrific strength, directness and modesty to the part of Kamala Harris. Simon Williams dodders nicely as Joe Biden, and Freddie Meredith’s Eric is finely elusive. Lydia Wilson’s Ivanka is a Disney princess in stilettos and the most lethal character on stage. Brilliantly, she moves as if she were a fragment of celluloid not flesh. She makes looking confected seem to be a genetic inheritance. For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Hue Gets Too Heavy marks a welcome moment of change in the theatre. Ryan Calais Cameron’s play, which premiered last autumn at the New Diorama, is propelled not only by new voices, but a new stage vocabulary. The title tips its hat to the late Ntozake Shange’s “choreopoem” of 1976, For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf, but Cameron’s production is its own fresh and startling thing. It breaks apart the tradition of men being resistant to talking intimately; it disrupts any lingering ideas of monolithic black manhood; it proves again that movement in a play can be as powerful and expressive as speech. A knot of men are plaited together on a dusky stage: traditionally, this would mean they were fighting. But this huddle unravels gently: the chaps are not working against each other, they pull apart not from antipathy but to declare their individual differences. They are by turns fluid, punchy, witty, in gesture as well as word. One skims smoothly away from his mates reaching out to the sides of the stage, another flips himself into the air on one hand; a third barrels boldly to the front to challenge the stalls. Anna Reid’s design and Rory Beaton’s lighting – bright with spanking primary colours and plastic chairs – is playful, friendly. Dialogue and monologues are often troubled, always questing. The evening begins with generalised therapy talk that is a barrier to further questioning: it is surely time to bin the word “resilience”. It rapidly becomes particular – confessional, anecdotal, defiant, but never merely male grandstanding. There is a sad memory of infants shrinking from a black boy at kiss chase, and a boast about pulling because of being light-skinned; there is a terrifying recollection of a violent father. The men’s names suggest the reach, the point and the command of the play. Each is a different shade of black: Obsidian, Jet, Pitch.
