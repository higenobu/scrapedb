3/15/2022,"Global oil prices have fallen back below $100 (£77) a barrel amid ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine and concerns over rapid growth in Covid infections in China. The price of a barrel of oil slid to $99 on energy markets on Tuesday, before rising back to just above $100 in early afternoon trading. It comes amid a decline from a 14-year high of close to $130 reached earlier this month after Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine. Analysts said the drop was driven by hopes for a diplomatic solution in Ukraine. It came as western leaders urge big oil-producing nations including Saudi Arabia to increase supply. Oil prices had surged close to record levels of about $146 a barrel set in 2008, fuelled by concerns over supply disruption and the impact of sanctions designed to wean western economies off Russian oil in response to the conflict. The drop in prices also comes as coronavirus infections rise in China leading to tougher lockdown measures as part of Beijing’s “zero-Covid” strategy, which analysts said could hit demand for energy supplies from the world’s second biggest economy. It also comes after the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, signalled Moscow’s support for the 2014 Iran nuclear deal to resume as soon as possible, which would lead to sanctions on the country’s oil being lifted. Economists have said global oil and gas prices remaining at levels of earlier this month would dramatically slow the pace of global economic growth and add to an already intense squeeze on households and businesses through higher inflation. Although the oil price has now fallen back to the lowest level in two weeks, it remains at the highest level since September 2014. “The prospect of a diplomatic solution towards Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine would help ease the world’s energy supply shock that has sent commodities soaring,” said Victoria Scholar, the head of investment at the trading platform Interactive Investor. “Meanwhile on the demand side for oil, fears about an aggressive policy response from Beijing to China’s Covid outbreak has raised the prospect of a much weaker demand for oil from the world’s second largest economy.”",News/Business,Oil price falls below $100 amid Russia-Ukraine ceasefire talks,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/15/oil-price-falls-100-russia-ukraine-covid-19-china
3/15/2022,"At a private event in Virginia, senior Republican senator Mitt Romney delivered a stark warning about the threat to US democracy in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “We are really the only significant experiment in democracy, and preserving liberal democracy is an extraordinary challenge,” the Utah senator and former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential nominee said, according to attendees at the event in McLean, Virginia, who spoke to CBS News. The event was held to raise funds for Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican whose opposition to Donald Trump over his attempt to overturn his election defeat and the January 6 riot has attracted a far-right challenger backed by the former president and the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, in her primary this year. Cheney’s father is Dick Cheney, the former congressman, defense secretary and vice-president to George W Bush. CBS said he and other Republican establishment figures attended the event on Monday, which raised more than $526,000. Romney, CBS reported, cited the Russian invasion of Ukraine and said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was following an authoritarian playbook “rehearsed time and time again, over the many thousands of years of world history”. Romney reportedly said he had a chart in his Senate office tracing 4,000 years of the rise and fall of civilizations. CBS reported: “From the Mongol Empire to the Roman Empire, Romney said, autocracy is the chart’s ‘default setting’.” Critics said Trump was too close to Putin when in office. He has repeatedly praised the Russian leader since the invasion of Ukraine began. He has also condemned the war. Romney said: “What has kept us from falling in with the same kind of authoritarian leader as Vladimir Putin are the strengths of our institutions, the rule of law, our courts, Congress and so forth. “People of character and courage have stood up for right at times when others want to look away. Such a person is Liz Cheney.” Cheney voted against impeaching Trump for withholding military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to extract dirt on political rivals. She voted for impeachment for inciting the Capitol attack. Romney was the only Republican senator to vote to convict Trump in both his impeachment trials. Trump was twice acquitted, although six other Republicans joined Romney in voting to convict over the attack on Congress. Trump is in legal jeopardy over election subversion and his business affairs but he dominates his party, topping polls of potential nominees for 2024 and regularly hinting he will run. Bill Kilberg, an organiser of the Cheney fundraiser, told CBS: “I think people are really hungry for a sensible, rational alternative in our political dialogue. They’re not happy with the direction of the Republican party and they’re not particularly happy with the direction of the Democratic party.” Referring to Cheney and Romney, he said attendees “saw two, sensible, intelligent, rational conservatives, and they were excited. It’s been a long time since we had that opportunity”. Cheney has not ruled out a presidential run in 2024. Romney was given standing ovations, Kilberg said, when he praised the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and spoke about American democracy. “He said we have to appreciate how fragile this system is.” Kilberg’s wife, Bobbie, said: “That was the essence of Liz’s remarks as well. She said, if someone doesn’t have respect for the rule of law and the democratic system, then it’s all for naught.”",News/US news,Mitt Romney warns of ‘extraordinary challenge’ in preserving democracy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/15/mitt-romney-democracy-extraordinary-challenge-speech
3/15/2022,"Irecently spoke to a Russian historian who gave me his prognosis on the consequences of the war in Ukraine for human rights in Russia: “Mass repression and concentration camps.” Already nearly 15,000 people have been detained in Russia for participating in demonstrations against the war. What future awaits these brave citizens, as well as Ukrainians captured in the occupied territories? Since its occupation of Crimea in 2014, Russia has escalated the punishments for people exercising their right to freedom of speech and assembly. The most recent manifestation of the clampdown on civil rights is the law rushed on to the statute books to punish citizens spreading “fake news” about the military, with custodial sentences of three and a half to fifteen years. Marina Ovsyannikova, who held up an anti-war poster during a news broadcast on Russian state TV Channel One on Monday, may be among the first to fall under the new law. The Russian criminal justice system has practice in handling mass protest. Protesters grabbed on the streets are bundled into overcrowded avtozaks and taken off to detention centres, where they can be held for to up to 15 days. Most get away with a fine if it is their first arrest, but those against whom criminal charges are brought face prolonged periods in overcrowded pre-trial prisons (sizo). Eventually, they will come to trial, be found guilty, and then transported off to some remote corner of Russia. Here they will join other people imprisoned for their political beliefs, as well as the large numbers convicted for drug-related or other offences. The custodial sentences handed out to people opposing the war will not be served in typical western-style cellular prisons, but in “correctional colonies” (ispravitel’nie kolonii). These house prisoners in barracks-like accommodation blocks, which were originally introduced to manage the millions of forced labourers who passed through Stalin’s Gulag. International human rights organisations have condemned communal dormitories for their association with high levels of inter-prisoner violence, and lack of privacy. The large cache of internal prison service videos smuggled out of Russia in November of last year shows that that torture and inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners is systemic in Russian correctional institutions. As the war produces large numbers of detainees and captives in occupied territories, the question arises of whether there are sufficient spaces for them in existing carceral facilities. It is inconceivable that Putin’s monstrous plan to rebuild the Russian empire did not factor in the need to reserve places in the country’s penal institutions to accommodate the new generation of political prisoners. In recent years, Russia has boasted that it has reduced the number of prisoners in the country, presenting this as evidence of the humanisation of its justice system (this is a myth, but that is another conversation). Today, there are about 380,000 people serving sentences in different categories of correctional institutions, with another 100,000 or so awaiting trial in sizos. The total prisoner population of just under 500,000 is more than half it was twenty years ago. The intriguing fact is that the number of prison facilities has not correspondingly halved. The prison service has closed 90 correctional colonies and remand prisons since 2019, but these closures have made only small inroads into total capacity of the facilities that remain. Analysing the available figures on prison population and capacity, it is clear that Russia has spare places for tens of thousands of new prisoners. This is confirmed by official figures showing that facilities for convicted prisoners are currently only 66% full . Currently, I estimate that there 400,000 places free in Russia’s penal facilities – with a new reform, which would transfer prisoners nearing the end of their sentence to newly constructed forced labour centres, creating the potential for another 180,000. Not quite the millions of the Gulag, but heading in that direction. Ukraine has its own network of prisons and there are unknown numbers of secret penal facilities in the previously occupied territories, which have been used for illegal detentions and are sites of alleged war crimes. We know from the wars in Chechnya, Georgia, and in the last eight years in Ukraine, armed combatants captured in the battlefield will be treated by Russia as zaderzhanye (detainees), not prisoners of war. The aims of Putin’s “special military operation” is demilitarisation and, absurdly, denazification. His rhetoric thus downgrades the Ukrainian professional armed forces to the status of terrorists, while the status that will be afforded to Ukrainian paramilitaries, volunteers and the civilians who aided in the making petrol bombs, for instance, remains unclear. The evidence of the past eight years is that Russia’s preference will be to transfer the people it seizes in Ukraine to the Russian heartland. Crimean Tatars, for example, who have passively resisted Russian rule since 2014 by refusing to take part in elections, have been vulnerable to accusations of belonging to radical Islamic groups. Their leaders have been transported from Crimea to remand prisons in neighbouring Rostov Oblast and, after conviction, transported to correctional colonies in the Russian interior to serve up to 20-year sentences. In a chilling article a few days ago in RIA Novosti, Russia’s domestic news agency, we learned that Ukrainians resisting the invasion are supposedly suffering from a generalised case of Stockholm syndrome; and that after liberation, “a whole complex of measures will be required to bring this mentally unhealthy population to their senses”. The fear must be that Russia will revert to measures gestated in the Gulag to correct those who are judged too slow in coming to their senses.

3/15/2022,"One of the US’s top athletes has been detained in Russia for almost a month. You would think that would be an enormous story, right? I mean, a celebrity caught sneezing is considered newsworthy (the actor Jennifer Garner, in case you missed it). Wrong. Coverage of the detention of Brittney Griner, a star player in the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) and a two-time Olympic champion, was sparse until very recently so sparse that there is a good chance this is the first time you are hearing about it. If so, here is the background: on 17 February, Griner, who plays for the Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg during the WNBA offseason, was arrested at an airport near Moscow. The 31-year-old was accused by Russian customs authorities of having vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage. She faces up to 10 years in prison. That would be a nightmare for anyone, but it doesn’t help that Griner is black and openly gay. Russia, I don’t need to tell you, is hardly an LGBTQ+ paradise. There has been a lot of outrage on social media about the fact that Griner’s detention hasn’t been bigger news. Some of that online outrage (shockingly!) is misplaced. The people firing off indignant tweets along the lines of “WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT BRITTNEY?” could have answered their own question if they had done five minutes of Googling. The Washington Post, for example, reports that people familiar with the case have explained that Griner’s arrest has been kept quiet deliberately because of worries that high-profile coverage could make her more valuable to Russia and jeopardise her release. If that is the case, why am I writing about Griner? Well, because the keep-it-quiet strategy hasn’t worked and US lawmakers are now openly discussing the situation. The athlete’s detention was first reported by the New York Times on 5 March and has been snowballing into a bigger story since – not least because Russian state TV has started broadcasting mugshots of the athlete. The genie is out of the bottle; it is useless to pretend otherwise. While it is not clear whether Griner, who was detained days before Russia invaded Ukraine, was arrested for political reasons, her situation has certainly been politicised. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat representing Griner’s home state of Texas, recently told the news website the Hill, for example, that she believes the arrest was “targeted and purposeful”. CNN is running headlines proclaiming that her arrest is the “most audacious hostage-taking by a state imaginable”. There are a lot of unknowns about Griner’s detention, but here is one thing we do know: she wouldn’t have been in Russia if women’s sports were more respected in the US. Griner reportedly earns more than $1m (£770,000) a season playing for UMMC Ekaterinburg; almost five times the $221,450 she got in base pay to play in the US last season and almost 10 times more than the average WNBA salary of $130,000. While that money is obviously nothing to sniff at, it is peanuts compared with what the male players get. Stephen Curry, the highest-paid player in the NBA, is reportedly earning $45.8m this season. Griner wasn’t the only WNBA star supplementing her income by taking on work in Russia; it is common practice. In 2015, UMMC Ekaterinburg even paid the basketball star Diana Taurasi to sit out the WNBA season so she could be fresh for the Russian season. “We had to go to a communist country to get paid like capitalists, which is so backward to everything that was in the history books in sixth grade,” Taurasi complained. Russia hasn’t been a communist country for decades, of course, but her point is well taken. I don’t know what the history books of the future will say about the current era (there is a helluva lot to be said!), but I do hope they won’t pretend that sports are apolitical. Griner has got a lot of flak in recent years for walking off court during the national anthem in protest against police brutality. Sports shouldn’t be political, a lot of people said. I hope the terrible Ukraine crisis, and the reverberations it has had around the world, has been a wakeup call to these people: everything is political.",Opinion/Opinion,Russia detained US basketball star Brittney Griner more than a month ago.

3/15/2022,"Disabled people will face “impossible choices in order to survive” amid a perfect storm of soaring energy prices, increasing fuel and food costs and cuts to government support, charities warn. As the UK steadies itself for a rise in energy bills next month at the same time as state benefits are cut in real terms, leading disability and poverty charities including Scope, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), Leonard Cheshire, and the MS Society have told the Guardian that disabled people and their families will be put under severe financial pressure. They warn that disabled people could be pushed to use food banks and unwashed soiled clothes in order to prioritise keeping lifesaving medical equipment such as ventilators running, as well as other vital goods. Disabled people typically have higher energy needs than the wider public, while being more likely to be in poverty. Una Summerson, head of policy at disability charity Contact, said: “Some disabled children need life-saving equipment that is powered by electricity to survive such as ventilators and feeding pumps. Electric wheelchairs, stair lifts and extra washing due to continence issues can’t be cut back on either; they are essential to quality and safety of life. So disabled households are going to face impossible choices … We have huge concerns how families are going to cope.” To care for their eight-year-old daughter with cerebral palsy, Dan McEvoy and his partner need to charge a dozen types of equipment each day: from a BiPAP ventilator, oxygen concentrators, a moveable bed, hoists, a SATS machine, to a feed pump. “Our electricity bill is due to rise £309 a year, and that includes some subsidies that we receive,” he says. “We’ll sacrifice food and heating to keep our daughter safe and healthy.” Charities are urging the chancellor to use the upcoming spring statement to introduce support for disabled people to survive the cost of living crisis. There is concern that the government are planning to bar over 200,000 people on disability benefits from claiming discounts to heat their homes, in a move that the poverty charity Turn2Us warn could push many disabled people into “extreme hardship” when combined with rising prices and other funding cuts. Thomas Cave, policy and public affairs manager at Turn2us, said: “Millions of people across the UK are facing a tight squeeze on their incomes as the cost-of-living continues to soar. But for disabled people who already experience additional living costs, the impending rise to energy prices could push many into extreme hardship. “We worry that disabled people will undoubtedly face impossible choices in order to survive as they contend with a perfect storm of rising energy prices, increasing fuel and food costs, and a real-terms cut to benefit levels in April. This is on top of a potential removal of the Warm Home Discount for people on disability benefits. We need urgent action to stop this cut to benefits, just when disabled people need support most.” Helen Walker, chief executive of Carers UK, says they are seeing “unprecedented” financial worries from unpaid carers and those they care for. “Many already face additional costs which they have to cover themselves, from specialist, life-saving equipment for someone who needs it to extra care costs. In our latest survey of 3,300 carers, 42% thought that in the coming months they would not be able to heat their home to a safe level and 32% are worried they will have to use a food bank … Thousands more are being pushed into poverty that will have a lasting impact on their finances and quality of life.” James Taylor, director of strategy at Scope, stresses many disabled people are already struggling: “Right now there are disabled people –whose condition means they need to keep warm – having only one meal a day. Others, go without so their children can eat, live in a damp house, or wake up cold and go to bed early. Our energy hotline and website have been inundated by disabled people facing impossible choices, with nowhere else to turn.” Becky Whinnerah’s 11-year-old daughter is doubly incontinent but rising energy bills means she can’t afford to dry laundry on rainy days to keep her clean. Whinnerah has three children – two have physical and learning disabilities – and plans to “slash” the family’s food bill and stop putting the heating on to get through the coming months. “We only have debt, no savings,” she says. “I’m terrified we’ll lose everything.” A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we have set out a £21bn package of support, including a £150 council tax rebate and a further £200 energy bill discount. The energy price cap also continues to insulate millions of customers from volatile global gas prices. “In addition, we know that living with a long-term illness or disability can impact on living costs and we’ve made extra financial support available to those with disabilities, or those who care for them, through Personal Independence Payment (PIP), Employment Support Allowance (ESA) and Carer’s Allowance.”",News/Society,Disabled people facing ‘impossible choices to survive’ in cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/15/disabled-people-face-rising-energy-fuel-and-food-costs-say-uk-charities
3/15/2022,"It’s surprising that there hasn’t yet been a classic film about influencers, with these modern-day narcissists now regularly being put in the cinematic pillory in the way sleazy politicians, greedy financiers or fictional movie stars once were. This frenetic horror-comedy debut by Marcus Harben – who sadly died last year – has a few sharp moments, but never quite reconciles its two sides to cleanly deliver the social-media skewering it’s obviously itching to. Posh-boy influencer twerp Jonty (Harry Jarvis), permanently skewed of baseball cap, is a minor-league entity online as he continues his “journey” at college. But he is in his element when he moves into a house with documentarian Zauna (Loreece Harrison) and fellow vlogger Amber (Erin Austen). When they keep encountering spooky disturbances – unexplained outbursts of 90s rave music, apparitions on laptop screens, unquiet kitchen fittings – Jonty begins to smell the clicks. As he posts the evidence online, his follower count explodes, even if some people, including their other housemate, acerbic alcoholic Scotsman Pete (Daniel Cahill), believe he is staging it all. With the gang rigging up Paranormal Activity-style cameras around their abode, or documenting their rovings handheld, Followers mostly follows the traditional found-footage format. It does, though, update it for the zeitgeist with regular segments featuring online commenters posting reaction videos – which capture the inane cacophony of the social media age. But the knowingness of this satire is incompatible with the fear of the unknown on which true horror depends, especially during the film’s jumbled early stages. Some of the characterisation is a bit uneven too: one minute Pete is denouncing the “Jontsquad”, the next he is happily colluding in the videos. Followers settles into more of a groove as the supernatural element takes hold fully, with Nina Wadia’s chirpy therapist also looking to boost her online numbers by getting in on the action. Harben clearly put some thought into the final twist, but it mostly only works on the horror front, and doesn’t really have much to do with the previous commentary on self-obsession. Jarvis is capably obnoxious as Jonty, but he is a bit generic as a creation; not quite the great influencer-monster cinema is crying out for.

3/15/2022,"Wilko has admitted it “got it wrong” for telling staff they could come into work if they tested positive for Covid-19, and apologised after it was criticised for issuing “reckless” guidance amid a new wave of coronavirus infections and hospitalisations. The homeware retailchain, which has 414 stores and 16,000 employees across the UK, sent a memo to staff with guidance on its workplace policy after the government’s relaxation of rules as part of its “living with Covid” plan published last month. “If you test positive for Covid-19 and feel well, you can continue to come to work,” stated the staff memo, which applied from 1 March. It added: “If you feel too unwell, you can follow the absence policy.” The government lifted the legal obligation to self-isolate after testing positive in England, where most Wilko stores and staff are located, from 24 February. Since the rule change, case numbers and hospitalisations have surged. Wilko’s guidance drew criticism with GMB, the union representing the chain’s employees, who said it was reckless guidance that could set a precedent other companies may follow. To all our customers and team members: a statement from our CEO Jerome Saint-Marc, on our COVID19 policies. pic.twitter.com/pakEcFiMrf On Tuesday, Wilko’s chief executive, Jerome Saint-Marc, issued an apology on Twitter and clarified that the company position is that those who test positive should “still stay at home and avoid contact with others”. “When we get something wrong we hold our hands up, admit it, and work to correct the situation,” he said. “Today’s news has highlighted some miscommunication within our Covid-19 policies, and I wanted to reassure all our customers and team members. The safety and wellbeing of our shoppers and teams is at the heart of our business and we’re truly sorry for any understandable concerns our communications may have raised.” Government policy differs in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, where self-isolation rules remain in place and employees have to quarantine for at least five days if they develop Covid-19 symptoms, and remain off work until they have two negative lateral flow tests. On Monday, Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC union, wrote to the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, saying: “Ministers are sowing dangerous confusion on Covid safety at work.” The TUC has said that people should not be forced into making a “terrible choice” between going into work with coronavirus or risk losing income by self-isolating at home. From 1 April, employers will no longer be required to explicitly consider Covid-19 in workplace risk assessments. “We operate an enhanced company sick pay policy and support those team members most in need, including those with Covid-19,” said Saint-Marc. “We’ll continue to look after our team members to the best of our ability.”",News/Business,Wilko apologises for saying staff could come to work if they had Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/15/wilko-apologies-for-saying-staff-come-to-work-covid
3/15/2022,"The Russian television producer who staged an extraordinary anti-war protest live on national television on Monday night outlined her plan to a friend the day before, having become increasingly angry about the Russian invasion, the Guardian has learned. Marina Ovsyannikova burst on to the set of Channel One during the national evening news holding a poster that read “Stop the war. Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” She was arrested shortly afterwards and has not been heard from since. “The anger has been building up with her ever since the war started,” said a friend of Ovsyannikova’s, who asked to stay anonymous. “Two days ago, she told me how she was going to do it.” The Guardian has seen a number of exchanged messages in which Ovsyannikova informs the friend about her plans. The friend said that Ovsyannikova, who has a Ukrainian parent, had been expressing deep unease over Russia’s actions since the war started. Ovsyannikova also released a pre-recorded video via the OVD-Info human rights group in which she expressed her shame at working for Channel One. “Regrettably, for a number of years, I worked on Channel One and worked on Kremlin propaganda, I am very ashamed of this right now,” she said in the video. Lawyers have been unable to find Ovsyannikova since her protest, which was an extraordinary act of defiance given that Russia had ramped up its already strict censorship laws when the war began. Her disappearance in police custody has raised concerns that she could be facing pressure to recant or that authorities could be preparing to slap her with more serious charges. Citing a source, Russia’s state-run Tass news agency reported that Russia’s Investigative Committee had opened an investigation into her case. That would indicate she will face criminal charges. Those could include “knowingly spreading false information” about Russia’s armed forces, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the actions of Ovsyannikova amounted to “hooliganism”, a charge that could put her behind bars for up to eight years. The text exchanges indicate that Ovsyannikova was aware of the consequences her actions could entail. “She is so brave for speaking out. I am very worried for her of course,” said her friend. The friend, who has known Ovsyannikova for a number of years, described her as a “very big-hearted woman” who “really cares about people, about her friends”. “At the same time, like someone who has been working for the state, she was extremely scared of the system and losing the life she built up. Until last night.” Ovsyannikova’s Facebook page indicates that she lived a comfortable life, often posting pictures from beachside resorts across the Mediterranean, as well as her children and golden retrievers. “She had a very good life, living comfortably and travelling a lot,” added the friend, who said they had not expected Ovsyannikova to go through with her protest. Another acquaintance of Ovsyannikova described her as an “empathic and bright” person. The friend recalled how Ovsyannikova once used her position at Channel One to find “the best” surgeon to help someone she barely knew. At the same time, the friend said she had previously “looked down” on Ovsyannikova for working for the state-run Channel One. “I was a bit snobbish,” the friend said. “I thought: ‘How could an honest person work on Channel One, telling lies?’” Ovsyannikova’s act of protest has been applauded by Russian opposition figures and western leaders. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was thankful “personally to that woman who went in the studio of Channel One with an anti-war poster”. Within hours of her protest, more than 40,000 people had left comments on Ovsyannikova’s Facebook page, with many praising her for taking a stand. News outlets in Russia have been forced to blur out her anti-war poster in their reports because of strict censorship rules which require media to avoid the use of the words “war”, “attack”, or “invasion”. Novaya Gazeta, an independent newspaper with a correspondent covering the war in Ukraine, said it had blurred out the sign because it contained content that the media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, had forbidden it from sharing.

3/15/2022,"British holidaymakers eager to help the people of Ukraine are being urged to book with travel companies that are using their resources to support those fleeing the conflict. Dozens of transport providers, tour operators and accommodation websites have jumped into action. Eurostar is offering unlimited free tickets to Ukrainians travelling from any Eurostar station to the UK, while Wizz Air will provide 100,000 free seats on flights from Ukraine’s neighbouring countries to any available destination. Airbnb is providing short-term housing for 100,000 refugees, and is calling for more hosts to offer beds, plus donations, while an unofficial social media campaign saw thousands of users booking Airbnbs in Ukraine as a way of getting money to people there, with Airbnb waiving fees. A new organisation, Hospitality for Ukraine, launched last week, is encouraging those in the hospitality sector to offer free accommodation for refugees: 220 accommodation providers have signed up so far across 19 countries. “We see this campaign as long-term support, therefore we are continuing to encourage accommodation providers to sign up,” said co-founder Charlotte Hall. Likewise Hospitality Helps is connecting refugees with hotels willing to provide free rooms in European cities, and Every Bed Helps, created by the Alliance of Serviced German Apartments Provider, covers cities across Germany, as well as Switzerland, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. Other companies are focusing on fundraising. Accommodation specialist Sawday’s and its glamping brand Canopy and Stars are donating 5% of its March revenues to the international Choose Love Ukraine Crisis Fundraiser. “As a company, and as consumers and holidaymakers, we feel we have a duty to help in any way we can, by donating as individuals, but also by choosing to book holidays with businesses we trust,” said managing director Mike Bevens. Ferry and cruise company Fred Olsen is crowdfunding to deliver trucks of donations to Ukraine, while adventure operators Explore – which was expecting to send 250 customers to Ukraine this year – and Intrepid are raising money for the Red Cross. Explore, which claims it was the first operator to pull out of Russia over the invasion, said it had received emails from customers committing lifetime loyalty over its response. Aito, which represents dozens of independent UK travel companies, said most of its members were helping, whether by donating money or collecting goods. “The best way for British holidaymakers to help is to keep travel alive,” said spokeswoman Sue Ockwell. “If the economy in Britain and Europe is healthy, governments will be in a position to continue to place sanctions against Russia and to starve the war of funds.” Others are taking more immediate action. Anika and Jon Krogh, founders of adventure operator Nomad Greenland, have put work aside to drive minibuses back and forth from their home in Denmark to Ukrainian border crossings in Poland. They have so far rescued 84 women and children. “Through our work in the tourism industry we have knowledge on how to move people from A to B in a fast, effective way – and can find the right people for a task, which has aided our mission,” said Anika, adding that those helping in the streets, stations and refugee centres seemed to be predominantly small volunteer groups, rather than larger NGOs. The question of whether British travellers could also assist more directly by visiting countries near Ukraine is difficult. The economic boost from tourism would certainly be beneficial, but though the Foreign Office is not currently warning against travel – except to Ukraine, Transnistria and Belarus – travellers will be understandably cautious, and an impact on bookings is already being felt. Last week Jet2 cancelled all flights to Poland for two months as demand fell. Regent Holidays, which has sold trips to Ukraine for 25 years and is fundraising for its Ukrainian guides and partners, said cancelled bookings to Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Moldova were being refunded or rebooked, and that it had noticed a “slowing in inquiries for the Baltics”, with some travellers swapping to Iceland or Scandinavia. Dorota Wojciechowska, director of the Polish Tourist Office in the UK and Ireland, said: “If British travellers want to help Poland they shouldn’t cancel their trips. By going on holiday to Poland they are helping the country that helps Ukraine. The country remains safe. Tourism has not been impacted.” Some may want to travel to eastern Europe to volunteer. “Volunteering holidays are, particularly now, a fantastic idea,” said Wojciechowska. “Krakow and Warsaw have plenty of opportunities for tourists and volunteers.” The website allaboutberlin.com has links to organisations looking for volunteers there. And travellers could attend events in support of Ukraine being created in numerous eastern European cities. Kaunas, Lithuania, which is one of the European Capitals of Culture 2022, is replacing its planned Festival of Happiness with a series of Ukraine-related events, and will donate profits from merchandise sales. In the country’s capital, Vilnius, the Energy and Technology Museum is donating all proceeds from ticket sales to CulturEUkraine.",Lifestyle/Travel,How your holidays can help the people of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/mar/15/how-your-holidays-can-help-the-people-of-ukraine
3/15/2022,"Chelsea have requested their FA Cup quarter-final at Middlesbrough on Saturday be played behind closed doors after the club failed to get their ban on selling tickets lifted. The European champions have been granted a special licence to continue operating after sanctions were imposed on Roman Abramovich last week, but this does not allow them to sell new tickets. That means they cannot fill the away end at the Riverside Stadium and Chelsea believe the tie should take place in an empty ground to preserve sporting integrity. It remains to be seen how Middlesbrough will respond to Chelsea’s request. The Championship club have sold out the home allocation. A statement on Chelsea’s website said: “Despite engaging in extensive discussions with the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), the deadline to purchase away tickets has passed without appropriate amendments being made to the government licence which would allow a full allocation of Chelsea supporters to attend. Executives at Middlesbrough had been kind enough to extend their deadline for ticket sales and stadium allocation from 7.30pm last night until 9.30am this morning. “It is important for the competition that the match against Middlesbrough goes ahead, however it is with extreme reluctance that we are asking the FA board to direct that the game be played behind closed doors for matters of sporting integrity. Chelsea FC recognises that such an outcome would have a huge impact on Middlesbrough and its supporters, as well as our own fans who have already bought the limited number of tickets that were sold before the licence was imposed, but we believe this is the fairest way of proceeding in the current circumstances. “We will continue to discuss the issue of ticket sales with OFSI as there are a number of fixtures still to be played this season and we hope to reach a resolution.”",Sport/Football,Chelsea want Cup tie at Middlesbrough behind closed doors after fan ban,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/15/chelsea-want-middlesbrough-fa-cup-tie-behind-closed-doors-roman-abramovich
3/15/2022,"During the hazy days of lockdown No 1, when standing still in the world was a novelty, the home took on a new fascination. The way light crept round the curtain rail, the slight dip in the entrance to the kitchen, the advance of ivy up the backyard fence – this all became mesmerising, endlessly shifting and changing under the intensity of my gaze. Perhaps this is what happened to the artist Nicolaas van de Lande when he was constructing miniature beds; or Shenece Oretha, when she was weaving two speaker stands together; or Tereza Červeňová, when she photographed a rotting apple spliced with a blade of grass. In total, 10 artists make up Jerwood Arts’ touring exhibition Survey II, and it seems lockdown has had an unavoidable impact on all of the new commissions. Walking into its final stop at Site Gallery in Sheffield is like entering a Lynchian riff on my grandma’s lounge. Embroidered hankies glitter with the proclamation “There is Nowt so Queer as Folk”, pot plants creep menacingly around plywood structures of stereotypically beautiful women, three traditional straw dolls hide their eyes, cover their ears and shut their mouths. Spanning a whole breadth of disciplines, Survey II presents the work of early-career artists in the UK who have been nominated by established artists. Aside from the cacophony of distorted homewares, there is also a general sense of unease with the outside world. “Outside is dangerous, inside is safe” announces Cinzia Mutigli over footage of her staring anxiously into the camera beneath several layers of thick white duvets. Dressed in shimmering party outfits and a monochrome headdress, the artist lays in bed obsessing over the social interactions she will have to encounter in public – sometimes her voice splits and echoes, making it even more consuming. Footage of Pan’s People preparing to dance on Top of the Pops is interspersed with Mutigli rehearsing. “How can they know all the steps?” she asks of both the dancers and those who appear at ease socialising. Saelia Aparicio’s Three Dead Astronauts are “female” structures, entangled with plants that were once exotic in the UK but have learned to adapt and thrive in the climate. Oxalis, buddleia and mother of thousands seem like benign ornaments, but Aparicio reminds us that they have their own will to survive, dispelling the myth that it is humanity that controls nature. The sallow faces of her structures, with emojis for eyes and glowing glass towers in place of a life-giving bosom, paint a dystopian future where humans are outsiders or “astronauts” on the planet we once called home. On the opposite wall, Rebecca Moss screens three short films that tiptoe along the fine line between hilarity and hysteria. In Pancake, she stands atop a concrete wall, holding a paving slab above a pristine, three-tiered cake. I grin and hold my breath, knowing what is about to come, but the delay in the drop creates an uncomfortable tension that makes me want to shield my eyes and turn away. Similarly, Home Improvement – which sees the artist construct a kinetic machine that uses coat hangers to pull her face into a smile – begins in a lightly amusing manner, but as the coat hangers pull up higher her body shifts in excruciating pain until the process becomes torturous. The threat of violence is everyday and mundane; it is a celebratory cake exploding with a guttural thud, it is wardrobe furniture becoming weaponised. Van de Lande plays on the instability of life by manipulating materials, objects and scale. A tiny bed with miniature pillows sits on a stack of paint points that shrink and alter in size. Meanwhile, a door propped up on a work bench – on closer inspection – is furry, having been flocked. Laid out on a long strip of carpet in the centre of the exhibition, van de Lande’s installation demands the most attention. It is horrific and intriguing, tactile and repulsive, familiar and unfamiliar. A delicately crafted bed is infected with a collection of lumpy, wet and furry forms that – although static – seem to pulsate horribly. On a plush white cushion, a red painted ball appears to have been dropped from a height, splattering red specks in the process. Suddenly, the ball becomes a foetus and I desperately try to unsee it, hoping the longer I look the less like a baby it will be. My brain struggles to digest Van de Lande’s work. It recognises it but can’t categorise it. This is its brilliance – its ability to invite us in and then keep challenging us to alter our perspective until we can capture a scrap of understanding. All of the works in Survey II – whether embroidered snippets of the body or poetry shrouded in textiles – encourage us to keep looking, searching, asking until we find a way through. Perhaps this endless curiosity is how the human race will continue to survive.

3/15/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email. I have a long, emotionally-significant history with Elden Ring’s developer – I was the first person in the world to review Dark Souls, for heaven’s sake – but I still haven’t found time to play FromSoftware’s latest title. I once flew to California to play Dark Souls for 24 straight hours on a live stream. These games are IMPORTANT to me! And yet it feels impossible to carve out enough time to do Elden Ring justice. I know I’m not alone in this; most weeks I get emails from people who read this newsletter asking how anyone has time to play massive games and also have a job and a life. Games can be a time-consuming hobby, which is one of the reasons why it’s traditionally been dominated by teens and young adults with few responsibilities. For those of us in that annoying period of life where people need stuff from you ALL THE TIME, it gets harder. It’s tough to sink into something for 50 or even 30 hours when you have bosses (of the professional kind), partners and/or children to keep happy, as well as a resurgent post-pandemic social life. But like most working mothers, I have by necessity become extremely efficient with my time, so I’m here to tell you that it IS possible – you just have to take what you can get. You are no longer a student, and you can no longer spend an entire weekend wrapped in a duvet playing Mass Effect 2. But that half hour before work, or that hour when the kids are in bed? Take it. It’s perfectly possible to prioritise games that don’t ask for too much of your time, too. Most of my gaming diet now is things that take 5-10 hours and have something interesting to say. It’s especially useful if you can play those games with a partner, friend or housemate, thereby usefully stacking gaming time and social time – here’s a list I put together of 10 shorter games that are especially good in company. If you are going to pick a timesink, then you have to just stick with it. Bouncing around between a few different games that you feel like you’ll never finish is a recipe for dissatisfaction. It might take you a few months to get through Red Dead Redemption 2, Horizon Forbidden West or Elden Ring, and it might feel like the conversation has moved on, but if you’re enjoying yourself, who cares? The hot takes might be lukewarm by the time you get round to reading them, but is that such a big deal? Another solution for parents is to play games in front of your children. I’m obviously not saying you should bust Doom Eternal out in front of a seven-year-old and start eviscerating demons – but there are a lot of games that are suited to either playing with (especially older) kids, or while they watch. I’m reviewing Tunic at the moment, an interesting and very cute Zelda-a-like game starring an adorable fox, and managed a good 40 minutes of wandering around bashing creatures with a sword before my kid got bored watching. Be careful, though: I tried the same with Horizon Forbidden West a few weeks back, and it became quickly clear that it was a bit intense to be playing in front of wee ones, even though the violence was only aimed at robot wildlife. I was equal parts ashamed and delighted when we passed a bus with a PlayStation advert on it and my two-year-old cried “Look Mama, it’s Aloy! Aloy fights the METAL DINOSAURS! I wish I was Aloy.” There are games you can play actually with your kids as well, if they’re old enough and interested enough to pick up a controller, but this relies on them actually being interested in good video games. You’re never going to catch me willingly spending time in Roblox. My teen stepson and I intersected briefly on Minecraft and Destiny when he was a bit younger, but for the rest of the time our gaming taste has been poles apart. I am intensely jealous of my friend Carolina, who passed several happy months exploring The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild with her delightful six-year-old. That could be you! Maybe, one day, it could also be me, once my kids age out of lovely, educational – but ultimately quite boring – iPad games. Something I’ve heard over and over from people in my many years in this job is: “I used to love games, I just don’t have time for them any more.” Like anything, you gotta prioritise. Games aren’t a guilty pleasure, something to fit in around the fringes of your life; they’re part of life, and like all art they can be nourishment for the soul. Don’t feel bad about making time for them. Since indie games started to boom again in around 2010, there has been a steady stream of games inspired aesthetically and mechanically by the 16-bit era: the glory days of the Mega Drive and the SNES, bright colours and pixel sprites and chiptune music. This is because the developers making these games grew up in that era, and a lot of their titles aim to recapture some of the joy that those games brought them as children. More recently, however, there have been more and more indie games inspired by the early 3D games of the late 90s; those atmospheric, slightly weird treasures found on the PlayStation, N64 and PC. Tunic, the Zelda-like game starring an adorable fox that I mentioned earlier, is one of those. It reminds me a lot of the action-adventure games that I loved when I was really getting into gaming and waking up to its possibilities. It has mystery, atmosphere, secrets, and puzzles, all pulled together with an evocative look and feel. Reviews will start appearing tomorrow (that’s Wednesday if you’re reading this later in the week) – I can’t go into too much detail before then, but know that this does not disappoint. Available on: PC, Mac, Xbox One Approximate playtime: 12 hours Video game companies continue to remove their games from sale in Russia in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine. Pokémon Go no longer works in the region. Nintendo and Ubisoft have withdrawn their games, and Bungie has blocked its multiplayer space-shooter Destiny. EA, Microsoft, Epic Games (of Fortnite fame), Sony and more are also cutting Russia off. All of this follows Ukraine’s vice prime minister Mykhailo Federov’s open letter to Xbox and PlayStation, published on Twitter, asking the games industry to withdraw from Russia and prevent players in the region from accessing their accounts or competing in esports tournaments: “If you support human values, you should leave the Russian market!” Meanwhile, a bundle of 992 games for $10 (or however much more you want to donate) has raised more than $5m to date on indie game platform itch.io. Obviously I have not played most of these, but there are some good ones in there – for that price, and that cause, it’s surely a no-brainer of a purchase. The blockchain/crypto/NFT backlash is starting to make companies nervous: GamesIndustry.biz’s Brendan Sinclair reports that startup developers aren’t even mentioning the blockchain aspect of their new developer/project/business, even during job interviews with people whom they are trying to employ. Meanwhile, Peter Allen at Axios delves into a report on $17bn’s worth of NFT sales in 2021 to find that there is only one game of any consequence operating in this space.

Keeping with the theme, reader Amanda Forde wrote in with this question: “I wonder if you have any tips about how to play games with young kids? I played a lot of Mario Kart with my six-year-old but that got old. We’ve now moved on to Super Mario Bros U Deluxe, which we both enjoy but it causes HUGE rows. He blames me whenever anything goes wrong and I turn into a big kid myself and go into a rage … Is there a better game for a kid and adult to play together? Or does one of us just need to grow up?” I’m going to recommend Untitled Goose Game, which often has kids in Amanda’s son’s age bracket nearly wetting themselves with laughter; Minecraft, which is obvious but just still one of the greatest creative outlets for kids, and better than most alternatives; and Nintendo Labo, which has you building working cardboard models of motorbikes and fishing rods and pianos and then playing with them (it’s good for at least a couple of weekends, but I found my kid got bored by it after that). Oh, and Rocket League, if you can handle the competitiveness: it’s football, but with RC cars.
