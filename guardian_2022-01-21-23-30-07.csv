1/21/2022,"London NHS hospitals struggling to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic purchased £36m of cancer care, cardiology and other services directly from the UK’s largest private healthcare group HCA last year. Analysis of monthly public data from NHS trusts, published today by the Centre for Health and the Public Interest (CHPI), reveals the extent to which London hospitals have become reliant on private providers, prompting concerns about creeping backdoor privatisation of the national health service.  “Covid has been very much used as a cover for shrinking NHS care and expanding private healthcare provision,” said Allyson Pollock, clinical professor of public health at Newcastle University and an honorary professor at University College London. She said the money would be better used to invest in NHS staffing, equipment and expansion. This level of spending by individual NHS trusts is unprecedented for cancer care and cardiology, said CHPI. The spending is over and above the £2bn so far handed over from central NHS budgets to private hospitals during the pandemic. In recent years, NHS hospitals have purchased extra capacity from private providers for simple procedures like hip and knee operations, but they have not previously spent large sums outsourcing more complex treatments. HCA said its support had allowed 14,000 complex cardiac and cancer NHS patients to receive the care they needed. Many of them were casualties of the widespread suspension of normal care during the pandemic, as resources were diverted away from many specialisms, including cancer, to treat Covid-19 patients. By outsourcing some of the most pressing cases on their backlog to HCA, trusts ensured that those most in need were cared for. Prior to the pandemic, HCA carried out virtually no work for the NHS. Founded in Nashville, Tennessee in 1968, and listed on the New York stock exchange, HCA is the largest healthcare company in the world and has more than 30 hospitals and clinics in London and Manchester with another one due to open in Birmingham this year. CHPI’s research shows the company was the biggest private beneficiary of funds spent on cancer care and cardiology direct from NHS hospital trusts in London between December 2020 and December 2021. The biggest spender was Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, which purchased more than £20m of services from HCA. Barts was the second largest spender, with £10m. University College London Hospital (UCLH), Imperial College, Chelsea and Westminster, and the Royal Free also paid for HCA services. “The extent to which the private sector is now being used to deliver NHS cancer care services is unprecedented,” said David Rowland, the director of the CHPI. “We estimate it is only likely to grow as the NHS comes under more pressure over the next few months.” HCA said it had chosen not to take part in a new deal struck between NHS England and private hospitals earlier this month, for up to £525m for reserve beds and staff in case of an Omicron admissions surge. A spokesperson for the firm’s UK arm said: “We can safely provide this level of complex care because of the deep clinical infrastructure we have in our hospitals, which includes the highest levels of intensive care and trained staffing support. We work with NHS trusts on an individual basis and in response to their requests for support.” The fees the London NHS trusts paid to HCA were either covered by NHS England, which has agreed to pay private hospitals £10bn over four years to help tackle its backlog, or from the Treasury-funded elective recovery fund, created last summer to help hospitals recover their levels of activity post pandemic. Guy’s and St Thomas’ said the money had been mainly spent on oncology and cardiology, as waiting lists had risen during the pandemic. A record 6 million people are currently on NHS waiting lists for routine hospital care in England. A trust spokesperson said: “We have worked with HCA to provide complex elective care from admission to discharge, including surgery and supporting diagnostic services, such as scans, while continuing to maintain urgent and emergency care to Covid and non-Covid patients on our NHS sites.” Barts Health NHS trust mainly purchased cardiology and breast cancer surgery services from HCA. A Barts spokesperson said: “The trust has used HCA to enable staff to continue to provide planned care in a separate Covid-free environment while hospitals prioritised urgent and emergency care and Covid-19 patients.” He added that as the pandemic eases, it is likely that Barts will continue to use the private sector to assist with reducing waiting times. UCLH spent almost £3m with HCA last year, buying more than 500 procedures, most of them surgery for breast, head, neck, bladder and stomach cancers. Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust spent £2.6m. Chelsea and Westminster Hospital bought nearly £900,000 of services from the company, while the Royal Free Hospital spent £2,000. Chelsea and Westminster said it used HCA mainly to provide colorectal and gynaecology cancer treatment to patients, primarily between December 2020 and March 2021. “This short-term measure must not become a long-term expediency to running down the NHS in favour of the private sector,” said Colin Hutchinson, chair of campaign group Doctors for the NHS. “The principal reason the NHS now needs to make use of the private sector is because of long-term underinvestment.”",News/Society,London NHS hospitals bought £36m of services from US healthcare firm HCA last year,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/21/london-nhs-hospitals-bought-36m-of-services-from-us-healthcare-firm-hca-last-year
1/21/2022,"Ayear into his term, the Biden administration is in shambles. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema’s support for the legislative filibuster has killed the Democratic voting rights push. Biden’s Build Back Better plan, a massive reconciliation package containing initiatives on issues from climate change to childcare is, for now, dead in the water; Manchin and Sinema will determine whether any of its provisions survive in attenuated form. Immigration reform and healthcare reform, both central to Democratic intra-party debates during the 2020 primaries, have fallen entirely off the radar. The US supreme court may overturn Roe v Wade in the coming months. The latest wave of the coronavirus pandemic is still ravaging the country thanks not only to Covid denialists and vaccine skeptics on the right, but an administration that has struggled to keep its pledges on easy access to tests. Abroad, Biden’s courageous withdrawal from Afghanistan ⁠– a kept promise even the president’s harshest critics on the left were willing to give him credit for ⁠– has been marred by economic sanctions that have left 23 million Afghans without enough to eat, and the media is already itching to blame Biden for a Russian invasion of Ukraine.  None of this is to say that Biden’s first year in office has been bereft of real accomplishments or positive press. But neither the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act nor the American Rescue Plan ⁠– the president’s two great legislative victories thus far ⁠– have resonated with the electorate. Biden now holds the second lowest approval rating of any president at this point in their term ⁠– the record is still held by his predecessor Donald Trump. It’s clear across the polls that voters are faulting Biden for inflation and a supposed inattention to the economy. But elevated inflation has been a global phenomenon ⁠– and here, one of the proximate causes has been the strength of an economic recovery boosted by the American Rescue Plan. Really, Biden’s been focused on the economy to the exclusion of nearly everything else on the Democratic agenda ⁠– his recent pivot to voting rights came only after the collapse of negotiations on the Build Back Better plan which, in its initial form, was easily the among the most ambitious economic packages ever proposed in Washington. Messaging on the plan plainly hasn’t worked. The major individual components of Build Back Better are far more popular than the overall package ⁠– late last year, Politico and Morning Consult found that 47% of registered voters supported it, while increasing funding for affordable housing and expanding Medicaid to cover hearing services registered 65% and 75% support respectively. That’s not terribly surprising given that voters have probably heard much more about the intractability of negotiations over the plan in Congress than they have about the plan’s substance. While Manchin and Sinema bear most of the blame for this, some commentators have also taken Biden himself to task for overpromising on his legislative agenda and deviating from the centrism he’d been known for. “The president should remember that he won as a moderate and a unifier,” the New York Times’ Bret Stephens warned on Tuesday. “Biden would do better to move on from defeat and draft legislation with bipartisan appeal.” But as these critics know full well, there’s extremely little that both parties still agree on, and even modest bipartisan proposals like universal gun background checks have been doomed to failure by the legislative filibuster, which forces the 50-member Democratic caucus to win over not just some, but at least 10 Republicans to pass anything outside of budget reconciliation. Biden’s supporters and his centrist critics both have an interest in framing him as a visionary. But he isn’t one – the enlarged agenda the centrists disdain has been the fruit of internal party pressure and the sheer scale of our public health and economic crises. There’s plenty of evidence that Biden still favors moderation and restraint, especially in the administration’s executive actions and, on certain issues, executive inaction ⁠– there, the White House has spent the year frustrating party activists on issues including student debt, immigration and policing. It is true, though, that Biden has made a slew of extravagant and under-scrutinized promises. Like his campaign, Biden’s inaugural address last year focused less on making the case for a set of specific policies than on making the case for Joe Biden as our spiritual savior. “Today, on this January day,” he told the crowd, “my whole soul is in this: bringing America together, uniting our people, and uniting our nation.” Here, Biden’s failure should be obvious even to Americans who don’t follow the news closely. The tenor of political debate hasn’t softened; our substantive political divides remain just as deep. The notion that American unity was within Biden’s capacity to achieve was simply a lie ⁠– one of many he’s told about the state of our country and where it’s going. During the campaign, he assured voters that the Republican party would reach an epiphany and develop a willingness to work broadly with Democrats once Trump left the White House. In what amounted to open mockery of that claim, Mitt Romney ⁠– widely lauded in the press and within the Democratic party as one of the Republican party’s last voices of reason ⁠– compared Biden’s election reform advocacy to Trump’s post-election shenanigans earlier this month. “President Biden goes down the same tragic road taken by President Trump,” he said in a US Senate floor speech, “casting doubt on the reliability of American elections.” In his press conference on Wednesday, Biden insisted he hadn’t a clue that he’d face this kind of nonsense and opposition from the right. Believing him does no credit to his intelligence. This was another lie, one uttered to advance the strategy Democrats generally turn to when they’re down ⁠– projecting indignation over Republican obstruction while hoping, in this case, that voters don’t notice the Democratic party controls government and can pass whatever it likes provided the party is unified. Biden’s current standing gives us reason to doubt this will work in the November midterms. So does electoral history ⁠– incumbent parties tend to do poorly in them. None of that routine flux, the product of what political scientists call “thermostatic public opinion”, has produced the meaningful change many frustrated Americans hope to bring about at the polls. Inequality and corporate power are growing. Decades of rhetoric and poor policies have failed to bring about much progress on issues from healthcare to education. And both immediate crises like the coronavirus pandemic and long-term challenges like climate change seem beyond our capacity to address. That impotence has been the product of our institutions and the myths that sustain faith in them. Biden has taken a belated and tentative interest in reworking the Senate’s rules; opposition from Manchin and Sinema and the electoral biases of our system have not only hobbled his agenda, but also ensured that Democrats won’t be able to govern on its own again in Washington for many years to come should they lose their governing majority in November. It’s not obvious that there’s anything Biden can do to save the party from that fate. But it’s clear what moral leadership demands from him now. Our federal order is strangling us. He should say so. He should admit too that conflict and dissensus will always define American society. No other future is available for a country as large, diverse and nominally free as ours. And the achievements we take the most pride in today ⁠– from women’s suffrage to the civil rights movement ⁠– simply would not have been possible if leaders had limited their aspirations to objectives that “brought Americans together”. Naturally, there’s not a chance in hell anything like this will ever pass from Biden’s lips. It’s not savvy and it’s not safe. But it is the truth, and the American people deserve to hear it from someone someday. Osita Nwanevu is a Guardian US columnist",Opinion/Opinion,Biden’s administration is in shambles.

1/21/2022,"The Dutch creator of reality TV shows including The Voice and Big Brother has been accused of victim-blaming by his company’s female employees after accusations of widespread sexual abuse of contestants on the original Dutch version of The Voice. In a full-page advert in the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, a group of employees at the production company Talpa Media castigated its founder, John De Mol, for suggesting that women as well as men had lessons to learn from a scandal that has gripped the country this week and prompted the broadcaster RTL to take Friday’s episode of The Voice of Holland off air.  Following a deluge of allegations of abuse made against men on the show, De Mol, 66, said in an interview: “Do not wait. Do not be afraid. You have to open your mouth. Only then can we help you … Women apparently have a kind of shame, I don’t know what it is, but I would like to delve into it.” In response, an advert was published in Friday’s newspaper that said: “Dear John, it’s not the women. Greetings, the women of your company.” In an accompanying statement the group of employees wrote of their “amazement and shame” at De Mol’s comments. It “says a lot about a culture change that is needed within the company, but also in the media world and society,” the statement continued. “And certainly at more large companies where these kinds of thinking errors are still made by men in power. “Women’s behaviour is not the problem. And not the solution either. This statement is of course also for all other victims of sexually transgressive behaviour in the workplace (not just at Talpa), to encourage them.” Talpa Media is run by De Mol but has been owned by ITV since 2015. The Voice of Holland was suspended before Thursday’s broadcast of a documentary on the YouTube channel Boos, which translates as “angry”, and is run by the public broadcasting company BNNVARA. In the documentary, dozens of anonymous women alleged that high-profile men on The Voice had sexually harassed, abused and assaulted them. A spokesperson for ITV Studios said the company was “shocked and dismayed” by the allegations but declined to comment on De Mol’s interview. She said: “Our utmost priority is to provide a safe and supportive environment for everyone who takes part in or works on our shows and there is zero tolerance at ITV Studios for the type of behaviour highlighted in the show. “After ITV Studios received notice from Boos of this behaviour last week we moved quickly to launch an external investigation to fully understand what happened.” The rapper Ali Bouali, 40, a coach on the show who goes by the name Ali B, was accused by one former contestant of raping her when she appeared on the programme as an 18-year-old hopeful. In a statement, he responded: “There are now two anonymous reports that are presented with a lot of fury as news. That is unjustified. I cannot publicly defend myself against this. Nevertheless, it is clear to me that the Public Prosecution Service will in both cases have to decide to dismiss [the allegations]. I am not guilty of what I am accused of in the claims.” Before the broadcast of the allegations, Jeroen Rietbergen, 50, the show’s bandleader, stood down after admitting to having had “sexual contact” with women on the show and sending sexually oriented messages on an app. Rietbergen, until recently the partner of De Mol’s sister, the TV presenter Linda de Mol, said he was not aware of wrongdoing at the time of the alleged incidents. Six other women have made complaints about the singer Marco Borsato, three of them contestants on The Voice and three on The Voice Kids. Borasto denies any wrongdoing. De Mol, who initially made his fortune through development of the reality television series Big Brother, spoke of his disappointment that the HR procedures in his company had not protected the contestants. ITV bought Talpa Media seven years ago for £355m, with further payments dependent on future performance, up to a total potential cost of £920,000. The company has created 75 shows in more than 180 countries. The Voice format, in which singers are selected via public auditions and then coached by professionals before a competition for a recording contract, has been aired in 50 countries. Anouk Teeuwe, a female singer who represented the Netherlands at the Eurovision song contest in 2013, said she had quit as a coach on the programme. “The news is so saddening and a major disappointment,” she said. “I know enough. I’ve decided I don’t want to return to The Voice. It’s a corrupt mess. I don’t want to work at a place where men have, for years, abused their positions and where others have chosen to keep the misconduct silent and look the other way. “You just can’t do that. You’ve got structural issues when you do that. I do not wish to be part of such behaviour, that’s just not me. So therefore, I will not return to The Voice of Holland.”",News/World news,Dutch creator of The Voice accused of victim-blaming over sex abuse allegations on show,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/dutch-creator-of-the-voice-john-de-mol-accused-of-victim-blaming-over-sex-abuse-allegations-on-show
1/21/2022,"Global energy firms Chevron and Total have announced they will withdraw from Myanmar, a breakthrough for activists who have campaigned for the companies to cut off what is a major source of revenue for the military junta. In a statement, Total, which renamed itself TotalEnergies last year, cited the worsening human rights situation in Myanmar, which was plunged into chaos almost one year ago when the military seized power in a coup, ousting the democratically elected government of Aung San Su Kyi.  The French company said the human rights situation and deteriorating rule of law “no longer allows TotalEnergies to make a sufficiently positive contribution in the country”. The US firm Chevron said it too was planning to leave “in light of circumstances”. Since the coup, the military has attempted to crush any opposition to its rule, prompting civilians to form armed defence groups. At least 11,651 people have been arrested for opposing the military’s rules, while 1,488 have been killed, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors military abuses. The announcement is a major victory for campaigners, who have called for all companies to cut commercial ties with the state-owned enterprise Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), which has deep links with the military. According to Human Rights Watch, natural gas projects in Myanmar generate more than $1bn in foreign revenue for the junta each year, its single largest source of foreign currency revenue. TotalEnergies has operated the Yadana gas project off Myanmar’s south-west coast since the 1990s, and owns a 31.24% stake. Chevron owns 28.26% of the project, which supplies Myanmar and Thailand. PTTEP, a subsidiary of the Thai national energy company PTT, and MOGE are the remaining shareholders. Yadanar Maung, a spokesperson for activist group Justice for Myanmar, welcomed the decision, saying: “TotalEnergies has finally taken heed of the calls of Myanmar people, local and international civil society to stop the flow of funds to the terrorist junta. “It is now essential that international governments move ahead with targeted sanctions on oil and gas to deny the junta funds from the remaining oil and gas projects.”TotalEnergies said it had approached the French authorities to consider putting in place targeted sanctions that would “confine all the financial flows of the various partners to escrow accounts without shutting down the gas production”. The company added it had not identified any means for doing so. The firm said contractual agreements state that, in the event of withdrawal, its interests will be shared between the current partners, unless they object to such allocation, and that the role of operator will be taken over by one of the partners. A spokesperson for Chevron said: “In light of circumstances in Myanmar, we have reviewed our interest in the Yadana natural gas project to enable a planned and orderly transition that will lead to an exit from the country.” “As a non-operator with a minority interest in the project, our immediate priority remains the safety and well-being of employees, safe operations and the supply of much-needed energy for the people of Myanmar and Thailand.”",News/World news,Chevron and Total withdraw from Myanmar gas project ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/chevron-and-total-withdraw-from-myanmar-gas-project
1/21/2022,"If you buy whisky only once a year for Burns Night, you might be in for a shock when scouring the shelves for your favourite brand: a 16-year-old Lagavulin, for example, now costs about £70. You can get the sweeter, less complex eight-year-old – a sort of Lagavulin-lite, if you will – for about £57, but the 12-year-old is now a £129.49 special release these days. Granted, you can still pick up own-label whiskies and household names such as Whyte & Mackay and Famous Grouse for about £20 (prices vary hugely, so it’s worth shopping around), but go for more upmarket “expressions”, and you’ll pay a good deal more. Johnnie Walker’s Black Label, for instance, is £20 in Asda at the time of writing (and £30 at Sainsbury’s), but confuse it with Blue Label, and could find yourself shelling out over 150 quid.  The whisky market has become all about what is euphemistically called premiumisation – ie, making it much more expensive. That’s partly about rarity: old casks are finite, which makes them highly collectable and a good investment at a time when interest rates have been at a historic low. The average per-bottle price last year was £426.58, according to Rare Whisky 101 (which, incidentally, categorises anything under £1,000 as “more affordable”). Market leader Johnnie Walker’s Pittyvaich, for example, from its Ghost and Rare range of bottlings from closed distilleries, fetches between £229 and £275, which makes the bottles in today’s pick look comparatively reasonable. Macallan, which has long been a collector’s item, fetches many times that for its new Red Collection, which ranges from £11,300-£65,500. The other big driver of whisky prices are the increasingly sophisticated oak treatments currently in vogue. There’s a fashion for unusual finishes, such as the three different kinds of barrels used to make the Isle of Raasay’s single malt, and including the on-trend chinquapin, a species of white American oak (that’s something to drop into conversation with a whisky geek). That said, there is value to be had, if you look for it. I recently came across the Australian-owned Bladnoch, whose head distiller used to work for Macallan and whose excellent sherry and bourbon cask-aged Vinaya (46.7%) is currently on offer for £38.99 at House of Malt, making it quite a bit cheaper than those produced by his alma mater. I also like the Pure Scot in today’s pick, which is a timely reminder of just how good a blend – and a modest ABV – can be. Ardbeg Wee Beastie five-year-old Islay single malt £38 Tesco (or £33 with a Clubcard), 47.4%. Who could resist a bottle with a name like this? Full-throttle, iodiny Islay. anCnoc Highland single malt 12-year-old £32.05 Master of Malt, 40%. A more delicate, restrained style of malt, redolent of heather honey. Pure Scot Signature Blended Scotch Whisky £32.99 House of Malt, £39.95 Master of Malt, 40%. Rich, characterful, and with a lovely, caramelised pear fruitiness that reminds you of the virtues of a blend. Isle of Raasay Hebridean single malt R-02 £48.95 The Whisky Exchange, 46.4%. Less peaty than an Islay, but intriguingly complex thanks to the clever use of different Bordeaux and American whisky casks. One of my favourite whiskies of 2021. Glen Marnoch 12-year-old Speyside single malt £19.99 Aldi, 40%. A classic, crowd-pleasing, award-winning whisky that does exactly what it says on the tin and is hard to beat for value.

1/21/2022,"For the past six months, our three-year-old son has been showing clear favouritism towards me. My partner finds it really upsetting and was recently devastated when my son blankly told him he loves mummy more than he loves daddy. We have another baby due any day now, so I try to comfort my partner by explaining that it’s probably normal behaviour for his age and is likely to be related to the changes that we are going through as a family, but he still gets extremely hurt by it.  I feel constantly caught in the middle, which is exhausting and frustrating. I don’t know whether to try to talk to my son about it, or whether to reassure my partner, who is very sensitive and feels he is being rejected. Is my son’s behaviour normal and is there anything we can or should do about it? How can I best support my partner through this? Your son’s behaviour is completely normal and, to a certain extent, so is your partner’s. We all want to be liked, especially by our children, and to feel that we aren’t can tap into something very young in us. I contacted child and adolescent psychotherapist Valentina Levi, whose first reaction was to reassure you that your son’s behaviour is “not worrying at all, but very typical, developmentally”. At this age, children start to realise they are separate entities to their parents and that can cause a lot of anxiety. The “terrible twos” (I know your son is three but it’s a phase that can go on!) are often mislabelled because, actually, children are expressing big emotions – the only way they know how with a limited vocabulary – and not being naughty or difficult. If it’s “terrible” for anyone, it’s for the child who is finding their place in the world. Children also start to understand that their parents have a life that separate from theirs. It’s your husband’s reaction that we need to look at a bit more closely. He is, after all, the other adult. While his reaction is understandable, you describe it as “extreme”. If he’s feeling pushed out, it’s because the intimacy between a mother and her child can feel very excluding, even if it’s not intended that way. “What is it that’s making your husband feel wounded?” asked Levi. “Is it making him think about something in his own history or does something else feel unbalanced between the three of you?” It may be worth looking at what this brings up in you, too. Levi recommended that your husband spend some one-on-one time with his son; after all, he probably will have to do this when the new baby comes along. “This is really important to secure a really good relationship between father and son in preparation for the baby’s arrival.” When the new baby is born, I recommend that you also spend time alone with your son to help him feel he hasn’t lost you. My other top tip is to call the new baby “your sister/brother” rather than “the baby”, as this connects it to him. And, of course, you must never tell him he has to love his brother or sister. It’s important not to let your son know he can upset his father because that’s a heavy burden for a child. Levi recommended saying something simple like: “Sometimes you might feel like that but ultimately we/I think you do love Daddy.” That way you can confirm your son’s feeling, but reassure him that ultimately nothing catastrophic has happened.

1/21/2022,"Meat Loaf’s songs were so inherently cinematic – the hysterical melodrama of I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That), the three-act sex-comedy of Paradise By the Dashboard Light, the biker-movie wildness of Bat Out of Hell – that they seemed to emerge not from the speakers but from a rowdy drive-in or a tumbledown picture palace. Perhaps that explains why he never found (or went looking for) the sort of distinctive movie role that would have decanted his persona on to the screen like David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Madonna in Desperately Seeking Susan or Prince in Purple Rain. A single signature movie might have over-egged the Meat Loaf, or else looked measly next to songs that felt like all-night film shows.  If any performance distilled his essence, it was the one he gave in The Rocky Horror Picture Show in 1975. His first major role, it came two years before the release of Bat Out of Hell and feels now like a taster for that album. As the biker Eddie, he roars out of the deep freeze and into the pristine laboratory of Dr Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry) and his guests (Christopher Biggins among them), fouling up the place with his uncouth manner and nasty exhaust fumes. Bellowing out Hot Patootie (Bless My Soul) and parping on his saxophone, he introduces some grubby animal magnetism into the air of camp debauchery. It doesn’t last long: Frank-N-Furter kills him with a pick-axe. The singer’s most prominent role was in Alan Rudolph’s likable 1980 comedy Roadie, where he plays the title character – a big lug largely oblivious to music (he thinks Alice Cooper is a woman) who becomes the best roadie in the world. The film is peppered with cameos from musical stars: Cooper, Roy Orbison, the whole of Blondie. That same two-tier system, with Meat Loaf as a character surrounded by music-industry colleagues playing themselves, was in operation again in the 1992 comedy Wayne’s World, directed by Penelope Spheeris and co-written by its star, Mike Myers. Cooper played himself once more, condescending to be worshipped by the goofy heroes, Wayne (Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey), while Meat Loaf was cast as a bouncer named Tiny. Not a little odd given that Wayne and Garth, high on the operatic pomp of Bohemian Rhapsody, would surely have been Bat Out of Hell devotees to boot. It was the same story in another music-laden film with “World” in the title. In Spice World: The Movie, released five years later, Elton John and Bob Geldof got to play themselves while Meat Loaf – possibly in homage to Roadie – drives a tour bus. He does at least get to smuggle in the title of one of his biggest hits. Those Spice Girls, he says, he’d do anything for them. But clean the toilets? He won’t do that. There was an essential earthiness to Meat Loaf’s persona that allowed him to play these blue-collar parts without it seeming bizarre that a man responsible for one of the biggest-selling albums of all time was dressing like a teamster. There may have been trouble off-screen – the fights with his Bat Out of Hell songwriter Jim Steinman, the bankruptcy, the well-documented volatility – but it didn’t seep into the performances. Other highlights included Leap of Faith (1992), which marked a move into drama for Steve Martin as a faith healer and co-starred a young Philip Seymour Hoffman, and David Fincher’s Fight Club (1999), where Meat Loaf played a man whose high oestrogen levels give him breasts. Unlike his co-stars in that macho hothouse, he kept his shirt on. A TV movie based on his life, Meat Loaf: To Hell and Back, was directed in 2000 by Jim McBride, who also made the Jerry Lee Lewis biopic Great Balls of Fire! A Meat Loaf movie seems by-the-by, however, when all the cinematic grandeur you need is right there in the records.",Arts/Film,"Bikes, fights and debauchery: Meat Loaf at the movies",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/21/bikes-fights-and-debauchery-meat-loaf-at-the-movies
1/21/2022,"The MyPillow CEO, Mike Lindell, is facing another defamation lawsuit for promoting his conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was rigged against Donald Trump. Smartmatic, a UK-based voting machine company, filed a lawsuit against Lindell on Tuesday claiming that Lindell espoused lies about the company switching votes from Trump to Joe Biden in order to better sell his products.  “Crazy like a fox. Mike Lindell knows exactly what he is doing, and it is dangerous,” Smartmatic said in the lawsuit, filed to a federal court in Minnesota. “Lindell intentionally stoked the fires of xenophobia and party-divide for the noble purpose of selling his pillows.” The company noted that the MyPillow brand was “a ubiquitous feature” and was “strategically placed” during his media appearances. Lindell is already facing a $1.3bn lawsuit from Dominion, another voting machine company, that was filed last February. In August, a federal judge gave the green light for the lawsuit against Lindell to move forward to a trial. Smartmatic is seeking unspecified monetary damages in its suit. Multiple investigations into the 2020 election have found no evidence of the widespread voter fraud that Lindell and other Trump allies have been claiming. Lindell has spent the last year advancing his conspiracy theory, funding a three-week bus tour and a three-day “cyber symposium” on the election. In response to Smartmatic’s lawsuit, Lindell said he was “excited” to present evidence that he has against the company. “They’re guilty. They’ve attacked us and were part of the biggest crime in history against our country. And they’re going to all go to prison,” Lindell told Business Insider. Lindell also pointed out that he had lost over $80m after major retailers dropped his product and that he had spent $30m of his own money trying to prove his election fraud theories. In addition to Smartmatic’s lawsuit, the state of Idaho on Tuesday sent Lindell a cease-and-desist letter ordering him to remove false statements about the state’s election from his website. The state, which voted for Trump in the 2020 election, also billed Lindell $6,558.83 to cover the cost the state spent refuting Lindell’s claims. Despite the multiple lawsuits that he faces, Lindell is still actively trying to promote his theories on the 2020 election. Most recently, Lindell was seen on a conservative media site saying that he had “enough evidence to put everybody in prison for life, 300 and some million people”, though 159 million people voted in the 2020 election.",News/US news,MyPillow CEO faces defamation lawsuit from second voting machine maker,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/21/mypillow-ceo-mike-lindell-defamation-lawsuit-voting-machine-smartmatic
1/21/2022,"How are you finding the pace of Boris Johnson’s political demise? I once saw a wildlife clip where a snake was eating a live chicken, but stopped for a long rest in the middle of it, leaving the bird sort of half in, half out of the jaws. The chicken veered between shock, which gave the appearance of calm, and distressingly grim bouts of flailing. Though it wasn’t wearing the Facemask of Shame and trying to talk about its vaccine rollout, I did find myself reminded of it this week. Of course, in tribute to Johnson’s gift for political escapology, David Cameron once called Johnson a “greased piglet”. But as David well knows, even pigs get defiled by reality in the end. Speaking of swine, there has been a huge amount to be amused by amid the horror show. It seems pause has currently been pressed on something called the pork pie plot, which must be a relief to the prime minister. I’m not sure Boris Johnson could handle the truly hilarious self-realisation of getting to the Reichenbach Falls and discovering his worthy foe was … hang on, let me get my monocle … ah yes, Gary Sambrook. “Bugger off, Gary – I’m expecting Sherlock Holmes, not some 32-year-old Freemason no one’s ever heard of.” And more on the generational comedy in a bit.  We know how bad things are because Johnson keeps saying that the public just wants him to get on with the job. If you ever hear a politician say “I think what people really want to see is us getting on with the job,” you know that what people actually want to see is that guy, specifically, being made to fight a hippo in a pit. Ideally a hippo with tetanus. For now, a range of outcomes remains on the table/in the pit. Some are suggesting that mooted Tory leadership rule changes mean Johnson could stay in post “on probation”. Or, to put it differently, we’d have a prime minister who’s out on a tag. At least he’d get more value out of his Downing Street flat refurbishment that way. Bear in mind this hadn’t been started in November 2020 and ended up costing him at least £142,000, so the Johnsons are currently looking at the best part of four hundred quid per day of use. In the meantime, we’re at the timeworn stage of the biennial Tory Hunger Games when the focus falls on the likes of chief whip Mark Spencer and 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady. I do enjoy all these burly men, who look as if they drive an S-class Mercedes and would get disproportionately furious if you parked in the wrong field at the Young Farmers’ Ball. Anyway, a lively week. Christian Wakeford is having a medical at Labour. Half the Tory party are acting like they’ve woken up after a midsummer night’s dream and can’t BELIEVE they’ve been involved in donkey porn. The other half would very much like you to know that policemen are getting younger. One report put the average age of plot leaders at 34, and many older Tories are Simply Not Having It on that basis alone. As one raged on Wednesday: “This isn’t like changing your brand of iPod, or your trainers.” Take it easy, Grandpa. Also: what’s an iPod? Warming to their theme, this anonymous elder fumed: “It’s not alright to have this fucked up by a lot of kids.” Quite. You can’t win anything with kids – a line first uttered when the Bishop Auckland MP Dehenna Davison was two, which certainly puts things into perspective. By now you’ll be getting the point, though, and if Nadine Dorries were any quicker on her feet, she’d have been out there screaming about Tory MPs being millennial snowflakes. But it feels telling that it’s this generation who are complaining about the whips’ intimidation of them. Finally, a working definition of levelling up – it’s getting up in some red-waller’s grill and showering them with spittle and the words, “I swear to God, if you don’t save the fat twat I will LEVEL YOU RIGHT UP!” The whips deny all this, but 34-year-old Tory chair William Wragg kicked off Thursday’s constitutional affairs committee session asking his colleagues to call the police on the prime minister and his henchmen for blackmail. Alas, as far as Westminster goes, the Met only investigates future crimes. I suppose you could get a private investigator to look at it for you, but honestly. Forget it, William – it’s Chinatown. Let’s face it, the Houses of Parliament are a place where blackmail is not just fully licensed but expected; where MPs formally found to have sexually harassed a number of their staff still come to work; where you basically do your own bullying investigations. You would call the Palace of Westminster lawless, were it not for the fact it makes literally all the laws of the land. And yet, Conservatives who have spent the past few years honking delightedly that there has been a political realignment have failed to understand that there may just have been a generational one too. The old guard really have internalised some ridiculously abusive behaviour. For decades, many politicians were unable to reach orgasm with their researchers or child’s nanny without their minds immediately racing ahead to whatever ghastly aye vote the whips would eventually extract from them in hush payment. For some, the response has become Pavlovian – even without the presence of a researcher or au pair, male Conservative backbenchers now become aroused every time they hear the division bell. To these deeply damaged, never-did-me-any-harm generations, the actions of the Pork Pies must seem outrageously insouciant. The plotters are apparently now discussing releasing phone recordings and WhatsApp messages from the whips – “the receipts”, in the parlance of the times. It reminds me of that Simpsons episode where some old buffer is sniffing, “I must say that in our day we didn’t talk like that to our elders,” only for Bart to shrug and say: “Well, this is my day, and we do.” You keep hearing allies of Boris Johnson – Boris Johnson! – lambast these youngsters for disloyalty and disrespect for political conventions. To which the only reasonable rejoinder is: “lol can I get a quote about the kettle from the pot?!” It must be said Johnson has seen “no evidence” of intimidatory behaviour. Then again, the PM saw no evidence of a party in 40 people gathering round trestle tables of food and booze. If even a quarter of the claimed threats end up being backed by documentary proof, Mark Spencer and his operation could end up looking like the least appealing whips this millennium, which is quite impressive, considering the silver medallist was played by Kevin Spacey. So there we are – it really is the most fantastic country. Don’t call it a banana republic unless you want to give the Queen her second apology inside a week. Settle on banana monarchy, and adopt the brace position for the Sunday papers.

1/21/2022,"Italy is to apply for Unesco status for espresso coffee, claiming it is “much more than a simple drink”. It follows the art of the Neapolitan pizza-maker being added to the UN agency’s list of the world’s intangible heritage in 2017 as Italy aims to secure the worldwide status for another of its successful symbols.  “It is an authentic ritual and an expression of our sociality that distinguishes us around the world,” said Gian Marco Centinaio, the agriculture undersecretary, confirming that the application had been submitted. Espresso quickly became an integral part of the national identity after its creation in Turin at the end of the 19th century. Drinking espresso creates an occasion for an encounter, to discuss politics and football, to complain, to make peace or to pay a debt, or simply an excuse to talk on this and that. According to the Italian Espresso Institute, founded in 1998 with the specific goal of safeguarding and promoting the original espresso, the market is worth more than €4bn (£3.3bn) annually, with more than 90% of Italians drinking a cup of it each day, usually served in a porcelain cup. The institute’s strict regulations for the perfect espresso include the use of a certified coffee blend, certified equipment and even licensed personnel. It specifies that the crema, the lighter froth that sits on the top of the dark caffeinated brew, “must be uniform and persistent for at least 120 seconds from the time the coffee has been dispensed without stirring”. It says its colour should be “hazel-brown to dark brown [and] characterised by tawny reflexes”. Centinaio said espresso’s candidacy was also a way to celebrate Italy’s social interaction, partially halted by the Covid restrictions. Previous attempts to have Italian espresso coffee on the Unesco list have been made but never officially finalised, allegedly because of the country’s turbulent politics. The agriculture undersecretary said he was confident Italy’s national Unesco commission would approve the bid, with the verdict expected some time in the spring.",News/World news,Italy seeks Unesco heritage status for espresso coffee,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/italy-seeks-unesco-heritage-status-espresso-coffee
1/21/2022,"If all he had ever done was record the album Bat Out of Hell, Meat Loaf, who has died aged 74, would still be guaranteed his own plinth in the museum of rock’n’roll. Released in Britain in early 1978, the album might have been conceived as the antidote to punk rock, which had been wreaking havoc on the music industry. The unlikely-looking figure of Meat Loaf stood at the centre of a bombastic maelstrom of sound, an operatic blend of heavy rock, fantasy lyrics, a choir of backing vocalists and long, multipart songs. It was rock’n’roll redesigned as gothic movie and Broadway spectacle. Meat Loaf had met the songwriter Jim Steinman, his collaborator on Bat Out of Hell, when he auditioned successfully for Steinman’s musical More Than You Deserve in New York in 1973. The pair worked on the Bat Out of Hell material for several years and were rejected by numerous record companies before the album appeared on Cleveland International label, distributed by Epic Records. The album reminded many listeners of Bruce Springsteen’s Born to Run, and its producer, Todd Rundgren, initially thought that Steinman and Meat Loaf were deliberately parodying Springsteen.  Sales of the record got off to a slow start – it took the airing of a three-song video on the BBC’s Old Grey Whistle Test to kick it off in Britain – but the album turned into a slow-burning phenomenon, becoming an almost permanent fixture on charts around the world on its way to selling 43m copies. In Britain, it has spent more than 500 weeks on the album chart. Though Meat Loaf enjoyed a follow-up hit in 1981 with the album Dead Ringer (another collaboration with Steinman and a UK chart-topper), he then suffered declining sales until he made lightning strike a second time by reuniting with Steinman for Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell (1993), which topped the charts in the US, the UK and several other countries, with sales of 20m. He completed the trilogy with Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose (2006), although that managed to sell only a couple of million copies. Meat Loaf was born Marvin Lee Aday in Dallas, Texas. His father, Orvis Aday, was a police officer, and his mother, Wilma (nee Artie), a schoolteacher and gospel singer with the Vo-di-o-do Girls quartet. Orvis was a notorious drunk, and Wilma would sometimes leave Marvin with her mother for safety when her husband had been drinking. After Thomas Jefferson high school and a stint at Lubbock Christian college, Marvin enrolled at North Texas State University. A keen football player, he acquired his nickname after an impatient football coach yelled “hey, meatloaf!” at him. When he was 20, a violent confrontation with his father prompted him to leave Dallas. “He came home drunk and tried to kill me with a butcher’s knife,” Meat Loaf told a BBC documentary in 2015. He caught a flight to Los Angeles, where he aimed to make a career in show business. He put a band together, called Meat Loaf Soul, who played their first gig in Huntington Beach as opening act to Van Morrison’s band Them. The band went through several different lineups and names – they became Popcorn Blizzard and then Floating Circus – and in the process of building a local following opened shows for numerous big names including The Who, Iggy and the Stooges, Pink Floyd and the Grateful Dead. When Popcorn Blizzard recorded a single called Once Upon a Time, Meat Loaf’s voice was so loud that the microphone had to be placed on the opposite side of the studio from the singer. Floating Circus split up in late 1968 and Meat Loaf returned to LA. He was working as a car park attendant when a stranger suggested he audition for the stage musical Hair. That led to him spending six months in the Detroit production of the show. As the production came to a close, Loaf and a fellow cast member, Shaun “Stoney” Murphy, were asked to record a duet album for Motown, called Stoney and Meatloaf, and they toured with Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers in support of it. After the tour Meat Loaf joined the Broadway production of Hair, and during the run he auditioned for Steinman’s More Than You Deserve. Their Bat Out of Hell project would grow out of songs that Steinman wrote for another projected musical, Neverland (a version of the Peter Pan story). In the meantime, Meat Loaf appeared in The Rocky Horror Show and the subsequent movie The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), and was also recruited to The National Lampoon Show on Broadway as understudy to John Belushi. It was after the Lampoon show ended that Meat Loaf and Steinman focused all their energies on Bat Out of Hell. The record’s vast success was not all plain sailing for Meat Loaf. He and Steinman formed the Neverland Express band to play the material on tour, but in Canada he broke a leg when he fell off the stage. Depressed and unable to perform, he suffered a nervous breakdown and started using cocaine. “I was an angry, violent guy who was out of control,” he later admitted to the Los Angeles Times. “I didn’t know how to deal with being popular.” He also lost his voice, prompting Steinman to turn the proposed follow-up album, Bad for Good, into his own solo album. The singer recovered and made Dead Ringer, which comprised eight Steinman songs and delivered a No 5 UK hit with Dead Ringer for Love, a duet with Cher. Meat Loaf had a falling-out with Steinman, who felt he had not received enough credit for the success, and also became embroiled in litigation with his former manager. He later told the Guardian he had “45 lawsuits totalling $80m thrown at me”, and was forced to declare bankruptcy. In 1983 Meat Loaf released Midnight at the Lost and Found, comprising his own material and that of a variety of songwriters, although not Steinman. The disc was a critical failure and sold poorly. Two follow-ups, Bad Attitude (1984) and Blind Before I Stop (1986), were similarly disappointing, and he was forced to rebuild his career by performing to smaller audiences, playing in the US, Europe and the Middle East, and gradually working his way back to arenas and stadiums. By 1990 the seemingly impossible occurred, and Meat Loaf and Steinman began collaborating again on what would become Bat Out of Hell II. Bat II sold even more quickly than its predecessor, shifting 10m copies in three months and delivering a monster international chart-topper with I’d Do Anything for Love (But I Won’t Do That), boosted by a lavish Beauty-and-the-Beast-themed video. In 1994 the song won Meat Loaf a Grammy for best male rock vocal performance. He promoted the album with a theatrical Broadway-style tour, and his status was now sufficiently restored to earn him a guest spot in Luciano Pavarotti’s all-star benefit concert for Bosnian children in Italy in 1995. His last studio album of the 90s was Welcome to the Neighbourhood (1995), which went platinum in Britain and the US, and yielded the hit singles I’d Lie for You (And That’s the Truth) and Not a Dry Eye in the House, both written by Diane Warren. In his autobiography, To Hell and Back (1999), Meat Loaf recounted stories about dragging his hard-drinking father out of squalid bars, being at Parkland hospital in Dallas in 1963 when the mortally injured President John F Kennedy was brought in, and once picking up a hitchhiker named Charles Manson. He commented that “people in Texas … love stories, and the best stories naturally have some bizarre aspect to them”. The following year the book was turned into the TV movie Meat Loaf: To Hell and Back. This starred W Earl Brown as the singer; Meat Loaf’s teenage daughter, Amanda Aday, had a small role as a grocery clerk. It was not until 2003 that he released a new album, the modestly selling Couldn’t Have Said It Better, though through the 90s and into the new century Meat Loaf had undertaken a string of acting roles in movies including Spiceworld: The Movie (1997), Crazy in Alabama (1999), Fight Club (1999), The 51st State (2001) and Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny (2006). He also made appearances on TV series including House, Monk and Glee. The Bat Out of Hell musical opened in 2017 in London and received the Evening Standard best musical award. Follow-up albums to Bat Out of Hell II sold in a downward trajectory. Braver Than We Are (2016) was his last collaboration with Steinman, who wrote or co-wrote all 10 songs, and was more a rehashing of past glories than a new musical departure. It reached No 4 on the UK chart and 31 in the US. A collapse on stage in 2003 led to a diagnosis of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. He collapsed again during a 2016 performance. In 2001, he changed his real name from Marvin to Michael. The same year his first marriage, to Leslie Edmonds, ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Deborah Gillespie, whom he married in 2007, and his daughter, Amanda, and stepdaughter, Pearl, both from his first marriage.

1/21/2022,"A man on trial for killing a suspected thief has told a jury he was performing a citizen’s arrest and thought the man was faking it when he told him he could not breathe. Nathan Smith, a 38-year-old carer, said he had no intention of hurting Craig Wiltshire, 43, but simply wanted to detain him until the police arrived. He denies manslaughter.  Smith pounced on Wiltshire in the early hours of 20 November 2019, pinning him to the ground for 12 minutes and kneeling on his back for nine of them. The jury at Bristol crown court has seen CCTV footage of the incident in which Wiltshire can be heard telling Smith: “I can’t breathe” but his captor replied: “I don’t give a fuck.” Wiltshire died two weeks later, a postmortem giving the cause of death as cardiorespiratory arrest and subsequent brain damage. The prosecution has alleged Smith used unlawful force on Wiltshire and wanted to punish him for crimes he believed he had committed in the neighbourhood. Giving evidence on Friday, Smith said he acted after houses, cars and sheds were broken into, leaving the community feeling worried and frightened. When Wiltshire was spotted in the area he leapt into action. He told the jury: “I was just going to detain him and allow the police to get there. I pulled him off the bike and held him to the floor so he could not escape. “I was expecting the police to come and take him. The police station is [nearby] so I thought they would be there in a couple of minutes. I had no intention to cause any harm. “He was fighting back. I did not think him saying ‘I can’t breathe’ was genuine – I thought he was trying to get me to let him up so he could escape or attack me. It never went through my mind he couldn’t breathe.” As he waited for the police, Smith said he was fearful. “I was panicking the police were not coming and was just focusing on not letting Mr Wiltshire up. I thought if he got up he would hurt me, hurt one of the other residents or escape. “I was concerned he had a tool or weapon on him and did not want him to go into his pocket. I was just focused on detaining him and thinking I just hope the police hurry up.” After three police officers arrived, it became obvious that Wiltshire was unresponsive. Smith added: “I could not believe it. I felt confused and I was sick. I was very upset and distressed. At no time did I mean any harm to this male – I was simply making a citizen’s arrest.” The defendant said that since the incident in 2019 he had not been the same person. “I am on antidepressants. I used to be quite a happy person but now I just feel mostly sad.” On Thursday, Prof Jason Payne-James, a forensic physician and a leading expert on restraint techniques, said he believed the force used was “reasonable”. He argued that while police and prison officers would have known detaining someone in a prone position could lead to positional asphyxia, an untrained person would not have realised this. Payne-James said he believed “a perfect storm” of conditions and factors contributed to Wiltshire’s death including his small build, an existing heart condition, the presence of the heroin substitute methadone and the sedative diazepam in his bloodstream and the fact that he was struggling. But cross-examined by prosecutor James Ward, Payne-James said it was likely that Wiltshire would have survived if Smith had sat him up when he said he could not breathe four minutes into the restraint. The jury has been told to assume that Wiltshire was the man suspected of committing crimes in the neighbourhood over the previous weeks.
