3/24/2022,"Every step of the way through Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, a D&D-infused spinoff of Gearbox’s cooperative shooter-RPG Borderlands, you think to yourself: this would be so easy to get wrong. The voice acting is exactly one decibel away from irritating at all times. Every joke walks a tightrope between exuberant fourth-wall prodding and juvenile gag. And after copious Borderlands games, spinoffs and add-ons, there ought to be a sense of over-familiarity about turning up at an enemy camp, shooting everything that moves, then watching your foes explode like scowling pinatas, before you hoover up all the loot they drop. But truthfully, there isn’t. Likable teen psycho Tiny Tina acts as the dungeonmaster in a game of Bunkers and Badasses, the Borderlands universe’s own brand of D&D. You are the fictional fantasy hero created by Valentine, one of Tina’s party of players, putting you Inception-level deep into fictionalised video game worlds: you play an imaginary character, created by a video game character, in a world invented by another video game character. There’s more conceptual abstraction here than those expensive candles with names like “Afternoon Escape”. The usual sci-fi arsenal of hi-tech sniper rifles, grenades and character abilities like turrets or dual-wielding guns are replaced by … well, all of the same exact things, but now with a very tenuous Tolkien-esque bent. In the opening hours, my spore warden landed on a preposterously satisfying combo of freezing enemies in place with a frost-damage assault rifle, then shattering them with a two-handed sword, while my mushroom companion poisoned any enemies I hadn’t yet smashed into ice cubes. Tiny Tina, played brilliantly by long-standing actor Ashly Burch, is improvising the entire time, which means that sometimes the world completely changes in front of your eyes to accommodate her whims. Approaching the town of Brighthoof, you’re told it’s under siege, but the scene looks oddly calm; at least, it does until someone points out that it should look more foreboding. Instantly, the sky rains fire, pirate ships pop into being along the coastline, and enemies abruptly materialise, acclimatise and open fire. In these moments, Wonderlands squeezes its excellent concept for all it’s worth, and if you played the 2013 Borderlands 2 spin-off, Assault on Dragon Keep, in which this world began, it’s all the more impressive that it still feels fresh and surprising. The atmosphere is like sitting around at a tabletop game with Jack Black, in that a good joke always trumps any moments of dramatic clout or traditional storytelling. Gearbox knows by now how to keep the narrative work light, and leave room for you and your friends to create the fun. The game has a real knack for making you feel like the quarterback of the fight – even if that means a team of four quarterbacks in one coop game, each firing off abilities and spells with wanton abandon. It’ll be hard to go back to the rather more straight-faced Borderlands universe after this jamboree of unicorn queens, goblin miner revolts and lute solos.

3/24/2022,"Rishi Sunak’s spring statement included several measures designed to help UK households cope with the rising cost of living. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, despite the measures real household disposable incomes are set to fall by 2.2% in 2022/23 – the largest drop in a single financial year since records began in 1956-57. It says policy measures announced in October will “offset a third of the overall fall in living standards that would otherwise have occurred in the coming 12 months”. Here’s what the spring statement announcements will mean for your finances. To help low-income workers take home more of their pay, the chancellor said that the level at which national insurance contributions (Nics) start to be charged will rise from its current level of £9,880. From July, workers will not make NI contributions until they earn £12,570 a year – the same level that income tax starts to be charged. For some earners the change will cancel out the NI surcharge that will come into effect in April. Figures from Blick Rothenberg show that those earning up to £40,000 will be better off from July than they are in the current tax year, although they will see pay dip before then. The table below shows what the two changes mean for different salaries. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says: “Bringing together the expected changes in earnings, the reforms to taxes, and the energy measures announced in February, a median (middle) earner on £27,500 a year can expect to be about £360 worse off this year than they were last. “A full-time worker on the national living wage fares a little better (gaining £140) because of the NLW rising by more than average earnings (though less than inflation) and because of the increase in the Nics threshold.” One of the main measures outlined by the chancellor was a 5p cut in the duty charged on petrol and diesel until March 2023. When VAT is taken into account, this means a fall of 6p a litre at the pumps. Filling up an average family car’s 55-litre engine will cost £3.30. This is one for the long term – it will be April 2024 before it comes into effect. At that point, the basic rate of income tax will be reduced from 20% to 19%. The statement said it would be worth an average of £175 a year to 30 million people. However, the personal tax-free allowance is set to stay at £12,570 for the next four years. If this remains the case the IFS says that by 2025-26 “virtually all” workers will be paying more tax on their earnings than they would have paid without Sunak’s policies on rates and thresholds. In April the state pension and other benefits are due to rise in line with September’s inflation figures – so by 3.1%. The chancellor’s decision not to announce a bigger increase means the payments are far behind keeping up with inflation. February’s figure was twice that, at 6.2%, and it is predicted to average 7% during the year. Pensioners on the full state pension will be about £290 a year worse off if inflation stays at 6.2%. For most, the £289 a year increase will not cover the rising cost of energy, let alone other price rises. The standard allowance for universal credit will rise from £324.84 a month to £334.91 a month for a single person over 25. Again, keeping in line with the current rate of inflation would have required the increase to be doubled, meaning instead a real terms cut of about £10 a month.",News/UK news,Spring statement 2022: what it means for you,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/spring-statement-2022-national-insurance-fuel-duty-income-tax
3/24/2022,"Nato countries will agree to provide special kit to protect Ukraine against any chemical, biological or nuclear attacks launched by Russia at Thursday’s emergency summit of the western military alliance. Jens Stoltenberg, the organisation’s secretary general, also told Russia to stop engaging in “nuclear sabre-rattling” and repeated warnings that the Kremlin could be seeking “a pretext” for chemical weapon use as the war heads into a second month. “I expect allies will agree to provide additional support” including “equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats”, he said the day before the meeting. The Nato chief declined to spell out exactly what would be supplied, though it is likely to include gas masks and protective suits. But his statement reflects heightened uncertainty across alliance members about Russian intentions as the invasion of Ukraine has stalled on multiple fronts. Stoltenberg described Russian comments that it would be willing to deploy nuclear weapons if Nato directly entered the conflict as “dangerous and … irresponsible”. On Tuesday, Dimitry Peskov, the spokesman for Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, had said nuclear arms could be used if Moscow thought it faced an “existential threat”. The secretary general acknowledged that Nato was “concerned about the possibility of use of chemical weapons or biological weapons” in Ukraine, partly because of “false claims that Ukraine, supported by Nato allies, [is] producing and preparing for the use of chemical weapons”. No firm evidence has been produced to justify the Russian statements, but Stoltenberg said such accusations “may be a way for them to, in a way, try to create the pretext for their use of chemical weapons” – echoing an almost identical warning made by the US president, Joe Biden, overnight before travelling to Europe. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will address Biden, the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the other Nato leaders assembling in Brussels on Thursday morning via video link, in an emergency meeting to discuss further military responses to the ongoing crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion last month. Poland is expected to present a proposal for a multinational peacekeeping mission in Ukraine at the meeting. But there is no support from the US or many other allies for a no-fly zone or any other direct Nato intervention, despite the increasingly bloody fighting. Stoltenberg was quick to play down any possibility of direct military involvement. “Nato will not send troops into Ukraine,” the secretary general said, drawing a distinction between member countries supplying anti-tank and other arms to Kyiv and the deployment of any forces on the ground. “When it comes to forces, Nato is not part of the conflict. We provide support to Ukraine but we’re not part of the conflict. We help Ukraine with upholding the right for self-defence, which is enshrined in the UN charter,” the secretary general said, suggesting it was unlikely the Polish proposal would develop further for now. The Kremlin has warned Nato countries not to deploy peacekeepers to Ukraine, saying that could lead to a direct confrontation between Russia and Nato. A deployment would be a “reckless and extremely dangerous decision”, Peskov said during a telephone call with journalists on Wednesday. “A special military operation is going on, and any possible contact by our troops with Nato troops can lead to quite clear consequences that would be hard to repair,” Peskov said. The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, had previously called western military shipments to Ukraine “legitimate military targets”, suggesting that Russia could be on the verge of entering a direct confrontation with Nato countries sending lethal aid to Ukraine. But so far Russia has not directly targeted the shipments, western officials have said.Russia’s placement of sophisticated anti-air defences in Belarus and military deployments to the Black Sea ahead of its invasion of Ukraine were also seen by analysts as a signal to western countries not to intervene in the conflict. Putin also held military drills of the Russia’s strategic nuclear forces in late February. Nato leaders are also expected on Thursday to agree to increase troop deployments on its eastern flank with the creation of four new multinational battlegroups in Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary to protect against any sudden Russian attack, alongside those already established in Poland and the Baltic states. Discussions will also take place about increasing the military presence near Russia even further still, as part of a process that will conclude at Nato’s scheduled annual summit in June. “I expect a part of that will be a significant increase of our presence on the ground in the eastern part of the alliance for the long term,” Stoltenberg added. The Nato meeting will be one of a string of leaders’ gatherings held in Brussels on Thursday. G7 and EU leaders are also holding meetings later in the day, with Biden a guest at the EU summit. The other meetings are likely to focus on trying to agree a further toughening of economic sanctions.",News/World news,Nato countries to give Ukraine kit to protect against chemical and nuclear attacks,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/nato-countries-to-give-ukraine-kit-to-protect-against-chemical-and-nuclear-attacks
3/24/2022,"“De fault!” exclaimed a triumphant Homer Simpson once, extolling the benefits of what he saw as “the two sweetest words in the English language”. Those sweet words might well have been heard echoing through the corridors of power of the Football Associations of England, Scotland, Wales, Norn Iron and the Republic O’Ireland, when it became apparent they looked on course to win a joint bid to host Euro 2028, even if it was only because nobody else wanted it. Yes indeedy. Following the scenes of drunken rowdiness and shambolic security that marred the final of Euro Not 2020 last summer, you could probably have got extremely long odds against Wembley hosting a major tournament final any time soon. However, it seems that a combination of international apathy and penury dictate that we may have to wait just over six years before being treated to the iconic sight of a lagered up roofer with a flaming firecracker shoved up his jacksie near FA HQ. While today marked the deadline for nations to register an intention to bid, the joint venture from the home nations was expected to be waved through as a formality as early as April after interest from Italy, Turkey and a couple of other joint bids appeared to have cooled. But what’s this? With the home nations busily counting their Euro 2028 chickens before they had hatched, it seems a number of spanners seem to have been thrown in the works of this tortured idiom. Unconfirmed reports suggest that intentions to bid for Euro 2028 have also been submitted by both Turkey and an alliance comprising Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia. Gah! What’s more, in what is either a spectacular bordering on wilful failure to read the international room or an act of obscene trolling, Russia have announced their intention to bid despite being banned from international football on the back of their illegal invasion of Ukraine. An incredible post on the Russian Football Union’s official website suggests they are also ready to “support the decision to declare interest in hosting the European Championship 2028 or 2032 in Russia”. While it is a declaration you would expect to be dismissed out of hand by those in charge of European football’s governing body, it has not gone unnoticed by The Fiver that Russia do not have a monopoly when it comes to misjudging the public mood. Uefa had no immediate response to the Russian declaration but may well have issued a statement by the time today’s Fiver has slithered into your inbox.

3/24/2022,"Scientists have announced the discovery of a 207-year-old whaling ship that sunk in the Gulf of Mexico, revealing evidence about descendants of African enslaved people and Native Americans who served as essential crew members. The 64-foot long, two-masted wooden ship was built in 1815 in Westport, Massachusetts, and was used to hunt whales from the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean sea and the Gulf of Mexico, but sank during a storm on 26 May 1836, the New York Times reported. Experts say the discovery of the ship gives new insight into the lives of Black and Indigenous mariners as well as their extensive contributions to the booming trade. “Black and Native American history is American history, and this critical discovery serves as an important reminder of the vast contributions Black and Native Americans have made to our country,” said the US deputy secretary of commerce, Don Graves. “This 19th-century whaling ship will help us learn about the lives of the Black and Native American mariners and their communities, as well as the immense challenges they faced on land and at sea.” The shipwreck was first spotted by an energy company in 2011 and again in 2017 by an autonomous vehicle, but was never fully examined. But on 25 February this year, scientists used a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to explore the seafloor and better inspect the wreck. Now, using research on the vessel’s history, combined with footage from the ROV, a group of scientists, led by James Delgado, senior vice-president of Search Inc, a US archaeology firm, Scott Sorset, marine archeologist for the US bureau of ocean energy management, and Michael Brennan of Search, were able to identify the remains of the wreck as the ship named Industry. Industry, in addition to providing insight into the experiences of Black and Indigenous sailors, is also linked to several prominent Black mariners including Paul Cuffe, a shipbuilder, philanthropist and abolitionist who hired almost all Black and Indigenous crew members for his ships, as well as Pardon Cook, who made the most whaling voyages of any Black person in American history. “The news of this discovery is exciting, as it allows us to explore the early relationships of the men who worked on these ships, which is a lesson for us today as we deal with diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace,” said Carl Cruz, a New Bedford-based historian and a descendent of the family of Paul Cuffe. After the sinking of Industry, mystery surrounded what happened to the crew. But new research by Robin Winters, a local librarian at Westport free public library in Massachusetts, has cleared up the crew’s fate. An 1836 article in the Nantucket Inquirer and Mirror reported that the crew of Industry had been picked up at sea by another whaling ship and returned safely to Massachusetts. “This was so fortunate for the men onboard,” said Delgado, who worked closely with Winters and several other local historians to confirm the identity of Industry. “If the Black crewmen had tried to go ashore, they would have been jailed under local laws. And if they could not pay for their keep while in prison, they would have been sold into slavery.” “When we find a ship, in many ways it’s like suddenly a book is open,” Delgado told the New York Times. “And not every page might be there, but when they are, it’s like, ‘Wow.’”",News/US news,Discovery of 1800s whaling ship expected to offer insight into Black and Indigenous crew,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/23/whaling-ship-discovery-black-indigenous-crew
3/24/2022,"If Donald Trump were still president, he told Fox Business on Monday, he would threaten Russia with nuclear submarines. Trump lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden, who is therefore dealing with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s status as a nuclear-armed power has shaped the US response, particularly in Biden’s reluctance to take steps, such as a Nato-implemented no-fly zone over Ukraine, that might lead to direct armed confrontation with Russia. Such caution cuts little ice with Trump. “I listened to him constantly using the N-word, that’s the N-word, and he’s constantly using it: the nuclear word,” Trump told Fox Business on Monday. In US usage, the “N-word” typically refers to a racist epithet for Black people. “We say, ‘Oh, he’s a nuclear power,’” Trump said. “But we’re a greater nuclear power. We have the greatest submarines in the world, the most powerful machines ever built … “You should say, ‘Look, if you mention that word one more time, we’re going to send them over and we’ll be coasting back and forth, up and down your coast. You can’t let this tragedy continue. You can’t let these, these thousands of people die.” Hundreds of thousands of people would die in any nuclear exchange with Russia. Trump has already said Biden should threaten Russia with nuclear attack. He has also said the US should put the Chinese flag on F-22 jets and “bomb the shit out of Russia”, and then “say, ‘China did it, we didn’t do it, China did it,’ and then they start fighting with each other and we sit back and watch”. He has also praised Putin as “smart” and declined invitations to call him “evil”, stoking speculation about relations between the two men and particularly what was agreed when they met in private in Helsinki in 2018. Trump has also condemned Putin’s war in Ukraine as a crime against humanity. Biden has called Putin a war criminal. When Trump was in power, in 2018, he announced that the US would withdraw from a cold war nuclear weapons treaty which kept US and Russian nuclear weapons out of Europe. It duly did so. New Start, an Obama-era nuclear arms reduction treaty between the US and Russia, remains in place. Analysts have warned that Putin could use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine. The Russian leader has put his nuclear arsenal on high alert. In office, Trump also demonstrated a cavalier attitude to diplomacy regarding North Korea, another nuclear power. Though he courted the dictator in Pyongyang, Trump also told Kim Jong-un he had a “much bigger and more powerful” nuclear button and would answer any threats “with fire and fury like the world has never seen”. He also asked the rapper Kid Rock and rocker Ted Nugent what he should do about North Korea. Writing for the Guardian this month, the former US labor secretary Robert Reich said he like many had thought nuclear powers would “never risk war against each other because of the certainty of mutually assured destruction”. “I bought the conventional wisdom that nuclear war was unthinkable,” Reich wrote. “I fear I was wrong.”",News/US news,Trump: I would threaten Russia with nuclear submarines if still president,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons-russia
3/24/2022,"Imet Djoubi in Mayotte, a French territory off the coast of east Africa. I took this in 2017 when he was 17, though I first began photographing undocumented immigrants in another French territory in the Indian Ocean, Réunion, for my project La Cinquième Île (The Fifth Island) in 2009. Mayotte is roughly 8,000km from Paris. It is part of the Comoros archipelago between east Africa and Madagascar, which includes three other main islands: Grande Comore, Mohéli and Anjouan. France colonised the archipelago in the 19th century with the intention of making it a sugar plantation. In the 1970s, three of the four islands voted for independence; Mayotte alone voted to remain attached to France, and has since become a destination for migrants from the rest of the Comoros. Most come searching for better-paid work, but others flee political instability. Despite not having legal access to education or healthcare, they risk the dangerous sea journey to reach Mayotte – and thus the EU. Migrants face deportation yet they continue to arrive every year. Many have drowned. Djoubi was born in Mayotte but his parents are undocumented migrants so he is also considered “illegal”. Alongside a number of other undocumented boys and men, he is in a gang who call themselves the bouchemen, a reference to the indigenous bushmen of southern Africa. They live on the beach in a banga, a makeshift hut, protected by their herd of dogs. Aged from 10 to 20, they live and survive on the margins of society. Many are orphans, or arrived on the island without their parents. Some are alone because their parents were deported. The Mayotte police often do not take into account the children of undocumented migrants. The first time I travelled to Mayotte was in 2015, following Patron, a young smuggler and the main character of my film Koropa. I wanted to develop a series about undocumented teenagers on the island, and that is when I spotted the bouchemen. As a foreign woman, my relationship with the gang has never been easy. They were aware of the economic disparity between us, and language proved an added obstacle – French is the official language of Mayotte, but most people speak local dialects, usually Shimaore. Fortunately I met Atou, who has a similar history to some of these boys and he became my assistant and interpreter. I think the gang enjoyed someone taking an interest in them, and I would often show them my photographs.As in William Golding’s Lord of the Flies, the gang create their own community guidelines. They voted to have no leader but the dominant personalities naturally drove the decisions of the group – boys such as Dakar, who built the banga from scratch. Djoubi, Djoe and Sabo were the ones who managed and trained the dogs. I would follow them for four or five hours every day, sometimes filming or photographing them but often simply sharing moments as they loitered around the beaches, or obtained food from the nearby coconut trees or banana palms. They often have to steal to feed themselves.I like this photograph because of how Djoubi stands: proudly, and surrounded by his dogs. The title of my project Ge Ouryao! (Why Are You Scared!) is an expression the bouchemen use to provoke passersby. It’s a way of poking fun at the local people, who regard them as delinquents and fear them. But the expression also reflects the pressures on the boys to grow up fast, to become tough as they live on the fringes of a society that largely rejects them. In Djoubi’s case, it is unclear whether he will remain in the gang or manage to find work, though the stigma of being an undocumented migrant and boucheman may prevent him from integrating into Mayotte life. I try to create images that upend stereotypes and offer new perspectives, to give back dignity, agency and even grandeur to the boys, as they live in limbo with an uncertain future. For me, this photo also reflects the wider political situation and is suggestive of the tension surrounding illegal immigration in Mayotte today; the fraught postcolonial history and the idea of the cinquième île, which for the islanders symbolises France, or the aspiration of becoming French – holding the promise of a better quality of life. The way I staged the photograph reflects the isolation of an island, or archipelago of islands, with Djoubi standing on the rocks – alone, and on the periphery.

3/24/2022,"As the chancellor stood up today, families up and down the country were facing the worst real-terms income squeeze in 50 years – and inflation has just hit 6.2%. So, did he do enough to ease the cost-of-living crisis facing millions? The verdict is a resounding no. The immediate support to families is woefully inadequate, with too little for the people struggling to afford life’s essentials and too much for those who don’t need it. Only 7% of the benefits of the 5p cut to fuel duty will flow to the bottom fifth of households, compared to 33% for the richest fifth; the increase in the national insurance threshold doesn’t help the poorest and only provides a £250 cash boost to low-and-middle-income families; and the 1p cut in income tax in 2024 is little comfort for families struggling with rising prices today. And any support for families on low incomes has been dwarfed by the combined impact of price hikes and Sunak’s decision to reverse the £20 uplift to universal credit last autumn. And yet there were things he could have done to take the pressure off families. He could have bolstered social security with a £15bn boost to give families at the sharp end of this crisis support worth £4,700 for a working couple with children; he could have opted to put a windfall tax on energy producers’ excess profits to soften the rise in energy prices for millions of families; and he could have invested £12bn in upgrading and insulating our homes, helping millions to reduce the energy they use. Today we needed to see real and decisive action to tackle a crisis that people are dealing with every day – and yet help was thin on the ground, especially for those who needed it most. The chancellor is about to learn that you can’t tax-cut your way out of a cost-of-living crisis; and millions of people are about to pay the price. Miatta Fahnbulleh is chief executive of the New Economics Foundation Part of the reason Tory MPs have been so unhappy about the government’s plan to hike national insurance contributions (NICs) next month is that they worry it takes away a key reason to vote Tory at the next election: low taxes. It’s why when Rishi Sunak insists he is is instinctively a low-tax Tory, it tends to be met with scepticism by his colleagues. In the spring statement, he finally put some meat on the bones of his claim. While he refused to axe the NICs rise, his decision to equalise the national insurance and income tax thresholds means that two thirds of voters should be paying less NICs even after the health and social care levy comes in. What’s more, his decision to announce that the basic rate of income tax will be cut in 2024 to 19p offers the clearest sign yet of how the Tories plan to fight that election – and when it will be. Boris Johnson and Sunak had been discussing a pre-election income tax cut privately for some time. Now they have committed to it. Indeed, with Johnson using prime minister’s questions to emphasise the importance of biology in determining someone’s sex and Sunak announcing an income tax cut half an hour later, the Tory campaign appears to be beginning to come into focus. The October budget saw Sunak announce more public spending – something he appeared to do begrudgingly at the behest of the prime minister. He told MPs privately afterwards that in the future, every marginal pound should go on cutting taxes rather than spending. Today’s statement suggests he is getting his way. Will it be enough? The issue for Sunak is that the cost-of-living crisis could get so bad in the time between now and the next election that few will feel all that grateful for a tax cut come 2024 – particularly if it is viewed as largely undoing the pain of the NICs increase. Worryingly, the Office for Budget Responsibility says that inflation will lead to the biggest fall in living standards since records began in 1950. While Sunak cut fuel duty, the measures won’t be enough to stop people feeling pain from this in the coming months. But for a Tory audience, a spring statement that emphasises cutting income tax, careful stewardship of public spending and resilient national finances is reassuring. These are the electoral dividing lines they know how to use. Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor The chancellor led with an appeal to motorists and, as many have pointed out, the cut in fuel duty is most likely to benefit an SUV-driving elite. Hardly visionary energy policy rooted in net zero and levelling up. That said, it’s great to see Rishi Sunak explicitly reference energy efficiency, with VAT being cut to zero on energy-saving measures such as loft insulation. It’s nowhere near enough, but suggests the Treasury finally understands the vital role of reducing energy demand. It would be good to see more of this in the long-awaited energy security statement, expected next week. However, this measure is unlikely to help families on lower incomes in the short run. Doubling the household support fund is welcome, especially for the people already struggling to pay gas bills, but it’s a long way from sufficient. Overall, once again, climate and energy policy is stuck in the waiting room. In the meantime, more and more people are being pulled into fuel poverty. Earth’s polar regions are heating up. We don’t have time to wait. Alice Bell is co-director at the climate change charity Possible and author of Our Biggest Experiment: A History of the Climate Crisis Rishi Sunak’s announcement of a fuel duty cut does very little to help pensioners such as me living in fuel poverty. In fact, it is the wealthiest people who use the most energy for cars and heating, and will benefit most from the cut. The measure does little for those who have reduced their energy usage down to the bone. Everyone ought to have the right to enough energy, free, to cover heating, cooking and lighting. To pay for such a pricing system the government could introduce a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies, and put an end to fossil fuel subsidies. We are paying fossil fuel companies huge subsidies and they are increasing inequality, all the while destroying the planet. The chancellor also failed to increase the state pension at a time when prices for everyday items are increasing, leaving people like me struggling to pay for the basics. Our upside-down economy needs a complete rethink. The spring statement shows Sunak was not thinking at all about people in poverty.

3/24/2022,"A row has reportedly broken out between a bereaved family and a council after a 37-tonne marble memorial to a former bare-knuckle boxer featuring a solar-powered jukebox was erected in a cemetery in Sheffield. Sheffield City council said the family of Willy Collins, who died aged 49 in July 2020 after collapsing while on holiday in Majorca, did not seek permission to build the tribute, according to the Sheffield Star. But the family of Collins, known to many as “Big Willy” Collins and the “King of Sheffield”, have disputed this claim and insist they had permission for the monument, which is adorned with four Irish flags and flanked by two lifesize statues of the late boxer. It also features images of Jesus Christ and biblical scenes, while the jukebox plays Collins’ favourite tracks. One of 16 children, Collins is said to have had nine children and about 400 nieces and nephews. He reportedly moved to Sheffield from Ireland as a child in 1980 and brought up his own family in the city. Councillor Alison Teal, executive member for sustainable neighbourhoods, wellbeing, parks and leisure, told the Sheffield Star: “All plans for grave memorials should be submitted to the council and must receive approval from bereavement services before they are erected. “For submissions, applicants must provide several details, including the material and size of the memorial, the proposed inscription and a sketch. A memorial should be less than 75mm thick and no taller than 1.35m from ground level. “We are aware of a large memorial which has been erected in Shiregreen cemetery. This memorial was built without permission and we are currently considering our next steps. “Cemeteries are a place where people can come, pay their respects and visit loved ones who are no longer with us. We understand memorials are deeply personal, however we must have rules in place to ensure fairness.” But Collins’ widow, Kathleen Collins, disagreed. She told the newspaper: “We own the land and we do have planning permission. The council haven’t contacted me or anyone from the family to raise any concerns. If they do have any issue with it they should contact us directly.”",News/UK news,"‘King of Sheffield’ memorial built without permission, council says",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/king-of-sheffield-willy-collins-memorial-built-without-permission-council-says
