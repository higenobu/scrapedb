1/7/2022,"The former NFL quarterback and current broadcaster Troy Aikman follows a strict health routine. One of Aikman's new habits is carrying around a water jug to make sure he's always hydrated. Aikman says Tom Brady turned him onto that trick, and it's made a difference in his everyday life. The Pro Football Hall of Famer Troy Aikman says he drinks up to 2 gallons of water a day ‚Äî partly inspired by Tom Brady. Aikman, who won three Super Bowls with the Dallas Cowboys from 1992 to 1995 and is now the lead color analyst for the NFL on Fox, told Insider he's always made a point to stay hydrated in addition to eating a Pegan diet and working out at least six hours a week. But it wasn't until he noticed Brady walking around with a giant water bottle that he really upped his water intake. Brady has spoken and written extensively about drinking up to 2.5 gallons of water a day ‚Äî halving his weight (in pounds) and drinking that many ounces of water daily. About three years ago, he stepped into a meeting with Aikman, lugging ""a big jug"" of water, and it inspired Aikman. ""I was reading more about the benefits of water, making sure you're hydrated, and I thought, 'I'm going to get a jug' because Tom had one that one time."" Aikman says he's been relaying Brady's water-jug example to his colleagues at Fox ever since, and just last month his partner, the play-by-play man Joe Buck, turned up to the Week 15 Green Bay Packers-Baltimore Ravens game hauling a jug of his own. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicinerecommends that men should consume about 125 ounces of fluids per day, while women need around 91 fluid ounces, but some individuals will need more than that based on their level of physical activity and protein consumption. Brady previously told Forbes that he drinks up to 37 cups of water every day, which is 2.3 gallons. For Brady, who is an active NFL player on a high-protein diet, that much water is necessary to stay hydrated, according to the American College of Sports Medicine. Aikman is not quite as active as Brady but does work out six hours per week. Drinking up to 2 gallons of water per day is appropriate for someone like Aikman, according to Healthline. The NASEM also recommends that people drink water consistently throughout the day and not just reserve certain times to load up on fluids. Having a water jug at all times to regularly sip from to get a steady intake of water is a much healthier habit to depend on than simply relying on getting big gulps fewer times a day, according to NASEM.

1/7/2022,"In a world that typically glamorizes muscularity and the ""buff body type,"" ""dad bods"" aren't just accepted. They're even considered ""sexy"" to some women. Starting as a viral trend in the early 2010s, ""dad bods"" refer to a less-toned body type on a middle-aged man; instead of biceps or a six pack, he may have a slight beer belly. One 2021 study found that 75% of single respondents preferred ""dad bods"" to the traditionally toned male body type. But are ""mom bods"" next? Not so fast. Experts say mom bods aren't likely to trend in the same way ‚Äî at least not anytime soon. Unpopular opinion: Prefer men with a dad bod over a six pack üòçüôå ‚Äî LucyyyLouuu95 (@LLouuu95) May 31, 2020 The buff body type is back in style: On social media, teens find inspiration, dangerous trends Men have long been able to get away with having less than perfect bodies. ""A dad-bod is not only tolerated, it‚Äôs lauded in society‚Ä¶ but from the moment a mom gives birth, there is a plethora of messaging out there indicating that in order to recover well, she has to 'bounce back' to her pre-baby weight,"" says Jennifer Wolkin, a licensed psychologist based in New York. ""So instead of being put on a pedestal for birthing an actual human being, a mom is shamed about her body."" Experts say this double standard stems from the idea that unlike femininity, masculinity is not predominantly defined by beauty. Analysis: Body positivity is everywhere, but is it for everyone? ""Our society values physical attractiveness, but our cultural construction of femininity in the U.S. places a premium on beauty, which is considered an integral aspect of womanhood and girlhood,"" says Samantha Kwan, an associate professor in sociology at the University of Houston. Past research has shown that beauty is more essential to feminine than masculine gender roles, and body size is a more relevant factor of self-worth in women. In contrast, we tend to be more forgiving toward men who deviate from dominant beauty standards of muscularity, ""because there is less emphasis on the way he looks, and perhaps more so on how smart he is, how athletic he is, or if he is a good 'breadwinner' for his family,"" Kwan says. Though someone with a ""dad bod"" may not have biceps or a six pack, Wolkin says it can still be attractive to some, because it implies he ""is wholly and unequivocally devoted to his family. That he doesn't have time to work at a chiseled physique and has pursuits outside of the gym."" Wolkin says this starkly contrasts with the pervasive attitude towards ""mom bods"" because ""when men see a woman with a 'mom bod,' they think, 'she's lazy and still hasn't lost the baby weight."" Celebrity 'dad bods': Jason Momoa isn't fazed by Internet trolls mocking his 'dad bod' This isn't to say that women are the only victims of today's unrealistic beauty standards. Men, too, deal with the pressure to sport six packs and biceps ‚Äî as seen by People's Sexiest Men Alive, like Michael B. Jordan and Chris Hemsworth. But research has shown that compared to men, women judge themselves more harshly: They idealize even thinner bodies from what men prefer and internalize more negative messages about their weight.  ""The need to 'snap back' to pre-baby weight might not be generated by men, but by women who have been impacted by messaging the health and beauty world continues to impose,"" Wolkin says. The pressure to look perfect: Khloe Kardashian‚Äôs nose job confession highlights unrealistic beauty standards However, these dominant feminine ideals of thinness (but not too thin) are difficult to challenge in a society that rewards women for conforming, and punishes women for deviating. Past research has shown that clinically obese women are at higher risk for employment discrimination, verbal and social abuse and anti-fat disdain. ""We live in a makeover society, where we expect women to spend time and money to conform to this ideal. And those who do are rewarded with financial and social successes, while those who don't suffer the converse,"" Kwan says. Glute pumping and lip plumping: TikTok trends insist the body is always something to improve. At what cost? Experts say the only way to normalize ""mom bods"" is to topple the rigid beauty standards that women hold themselves up to.  Fortunately, the body positivity and body neutrality movements have exemplified this need for change. Many influencers have used platforms like Instagram to display honest looks at their postpartum bodies while clapping back at body shamers who suggest tummy tucks. 'Self-love journey': After sharing postpartum bods, four moms clap back at shamers who suggest 'tummy tucks' ""Social media has given a platform to those who are outspoken against fatphobia, thin privilege and other harmful messages‚Ä¶ and I hope this continues,"" Wolkin says. ""The messaging needs to focus on staying mentally healthy and vital, and not on needing to look a certain way to feel worthy."" ""The more, we, as a society, can turn away from damaging body-image tropes, and turn toward body acceptance, combined with continued visibility of role models who both denounce 'thin as better,' and who themselves have bodies of different shapes and sizes, the healthier we will all become.""

1/7/2022,"Former Vice President Dick Cheney joined his daughter, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), in Congress on Thursday as lawmakers marked the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.

Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney were the only Republicans in attendance on the House floor for the moment of silence, according to CNN. The former vice president told ABC News that the Jan. 6 anniversary is an ""important historical event,"" and ""you can't overestimate how important it is."" Cheney added, ""I'm deeply disappointed we don't have better leadership in the Republican Party to restore the Constitution."" He also said the Republican Party's leadership is ""not a leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for ten years,"" per Politico. ABC News' Ben Siegel reports that Democrats ""one by one"" came over to introduce themselves to Dick Cheney and shake his hand. The New York Times White House correspondent Peter Baker wrote that there was ""something surreal about watching Pelosi and other Democrats happily greeting Dick Cheney, once their bete noire,"" suggesting it ""says something about how Trump has changed the nature of our politics."" Liz Cheney, a critic of Trump, on NBC's Today earlier on Thursday said the threat to democracy ""continues,"" and she criticized those Republicans who are ""looking the other way,"" adding, ""That's how democracies die, and we simply cannot let that happen.""
