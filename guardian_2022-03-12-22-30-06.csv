3/12/2022,"New powers to shield stalking victims from dangerous perpetrators were “mis-sold” by the government and are failing to provide rapid protection, according to a damning report sent to the Home Office. Stalking Protection Orders were introduced in 2020 and allow police to intervene in ​stalking cases before a conviction, to prevent obsessive behaviours from escalating. But the process of obtaining the Asbo-style orders is “very slow” and “bureaucratic”, according to the early findings of research cited in an official government review. In one case ​identified by ​the Suzy Lamplugh Trust,​ a​ woman who feared being murdered by her stalker said it took nine months from the date she requested a Stalking Protection Order for it to be put in place. In that time, she ​received death threats and suffered a breakdown. The ​research​​, conducted ​by Cheshire Police​ across five police force regions​, ​come​s​ as ​official ​data reveals a disparity in use of the orders around the country, with seven force areas failing to apply for any in the year after they were introduced. In all, court data shows 4​5​6 stalking protection orders were issued in England and Wales between January 2020 and January 2021​. About 80,000 stalking offences were reported nationally in the same period, according to the Office for National Statistics. While ​Greater London police applied for 133 orders, and officers in ​Sussex​ applied for ​41​, ​60% of the forces in ​England and Wales ​– 2​6​ out of 43 – made ​five or fewer applications each during that period. Among forces that did not apply for any were Thames Valley, where stalking offences surged in that period; and Durham, which saw a spike in stalking incidents, with 1,747 reports in 2020 compared with 818 the previous year. Durham and Thames Valley both said they took stalking “extremely seriously” and employed a “wide range of tactics” to tackle it, including SPOs. Thames Valley said it had recently increased its use of the orders, with five orders obtained in January 2022 and “further applications being progressed”. Gwent, Humberside, Suffolk, Warwickshire and South Wales also failed to apply for a single SPO in the first 12 months, though the forces say they have since submitted several applications. The Home Office said it was closely monitoring the use of SPOs and would “look with interest” at the final research from Cheshire police – to be published later this year – but warned that some of the findings were inconsistent with its own research. It said safeguarding minister Rachel Maclean ha​d written to chief constables where uptake was low urging them to improve use of the orders. “We expect all police forces to make full use of them,” a spokesperson said. Rachel Horman-Brown, a solicitor and chair of Paladin, the National Stalking Advocacy Service, said the failure to use the orders “typifies the way police deal with violence against women and girls”. “These orders are as rare as hens’ teeth. They’re just not being obtained. And in addition to that, police continue not to charge stalking,” she said. Because the orders are not widely used, many victims are resorting to applying for costly injunctions instead, she said. “They can end up in a worse position because then they’re also seen as personally taking the perpetrator to court. It increases the risk.” Violet Alvarez, ​policy officer at the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, ​which operates the national stalking helpline, said SPOs had the potential to be “brilliant”​ but that many officers had never heard of them. “​It’s one thing putting legislation in place, but if nobody’s using it properly, it becomes irrelevant​,” she said. ​“The understanding of the level of risk in these cases is really misunderstood​.” Reports of stalking have risen in the past decade​ and surged during the pandemic. The percentage of cases being charged has fallen from 23% in the year ending March 2016 to 11% in the year ending March 2020. About 80% of stalking victims are women. ​Stalking protection orders allow police to intervene as soon as stalking behaviours have been identified, while further investigation is conducted. As well as imposing restrictions such as barring contact or preventing a perpetrator from entering a certain area, they can also include positive conditions, such as seeking mental health treatment or enrolling on a drug and alcohol programme.​ Breaching one is a criminal offence. ​The Home Office review, published last month, highlighted areas of good practice and found “several positives” in how the orders were working, such as the fact that 15 are granted for each one refused. As well as court delays and lack of uptake, it identified concerns around monitoring of SPOs due to a lack of staff and resources. In January, Leon McCaskre, 41, stabbed his ex-partner Yasmin Chkaifi, 43, to death in Maida Vale, west London, while subject to a stalking protection order. Katy Bourne, the conservative police ​an​d crime commissioner for Sussex, one of the areas that has used SPOs most, said​ the orders could bring “real benefit” for victims when used effectively. “The biggest message it sends out is that they’re being listened to, and they’re being believed,” she said. She said there was “no excuse” for forces failing to use them. “Priorities are set by police and crime commissioners and if they don’t see this as a priority, there is no onus on officers to do it,” she said. “It’s a very big worry that some forces haven’t been using them. They’re letting victims down.”",News/Society,Anti-stalking orders ‘fail to protect women from danger’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/12/anti-stalking-orders-fail-to-protect-women-from-danger
3/12/2022,"Italian authorities have seized a €530m (£444m) superyacht owned by Russian businessman Andrey Melnichenko as part of EU sanctions following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Sy A – short for Sailing Yacht A – was seized on Friday evening in the port of Trieste after being identified by Italian police as belonging to billionaire owner of EuroChem Group, a major fertiliser producer, and the coal company SUEK. Video footage reportedly showed police cars with flashing lights approaching the yacht, said to be one of the largest in the world, and boarding it. EuroChem and SUEK said in statements on Thursday that Melnichenko had resigned as a member of the board in both companies and withdrawn as their beneficiary, effective on Wednesday. It comes as Roman Abramovich’s superyacht, Solaris, was pictured arriving in Tivat, Montenegro, on Saturday. The vessel left a port in Barcelona earlier this week as the UK government sanctioned the Russian billionaire owner of Chelsea Football Club. On Thursday it was tracked off the coast of Sicily after reportedly undergoing repairs earlier in the week in Barcelona, one of a number of apparently hurried sailings of Russian billionaires moving their superyachts to avoid seizure. His other yacht, the more luxurious Eclipse, was on Thursday located to the west of the Canary Islands. A European Council decision authorising the sanctions against Melnichenko says he was one of 37 business leaders who met with the Russian president after the invasion of Ukraine to talk about the potential economic impact of EU and US sanctions. Melnichenko, the document states, “belongs to the most influential circle of Russian businesspeople with close connections to the Russian government”. It adds: “He is therefore involved in economic sectors providing a substantial source of revenue to the government of the Russian Federation, which is responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Ukraine.” A spokesperson for Melnichenko, Alex Andreev, said the businessman had “no relation to the tragic events in Ukraine. He has no political affiliations”. “There is no justification whatsoever for placing him on the EU sanctions list,” Andreev said. “We will be disputing these baseless and unjustified sanctions, and believe that the rule of law and common sense will prevail.” Italian authorities have separately seized €143m worth of luxury yachts and villas owned by Russian billionaires in luxury destinations including Lake Como, Sardinia and the Ligurian coast. Nobiskrug, the manufacturer of Sailing Yacht A, describes the three-mast vessel on its website as “one of the world’s largest and most advanced superyachts” and the “ultimate embodiment of German superyachts built for the 22nd century”. It is almost 143 meters, the mainmast is 100 metres above the waterline, and has a gross tonnage of about 12,600. Other yachts seized by Italian police include “Lady M’”, owned by Alexei Mordashov, who, before being blacklisted this week by the EU was the richest man in Russia. A yacht owned by Gennady Timchenko, another billionaire with close ties to Putin, was also seized.",News/World news,Italian authorities seize one of world’s largest superyachts from oligarch,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/italian-authorities-seize-one-of-worlds-largest-superyachts-from-oligarch
3/12/2022,"A few days ago, the local authorities of Lviv, 50 miles from the border with Poland and a safe haven for hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Ukrainians, ordered dozens of statues to be wrapped in padding to protect them from Russian attacks. Despite being so far untouched by the bombings, the 700,000 inhabitants of this magnificent Unesco world heritage site knew that, at some point, the time would also come for them. So when last Friday the cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, about 130km from here, were targeted by Russian forces in one of the military attacks located closest to the west since the beginning of the war, it came as no surprise. The citizens of Lviv, among the strongest supporters of the country’s separation from the Soviet Union, are well aware that their town – described as the soul of Ukraine and a symbol of Ukrainian nationalism – represents everything the Kremlin despises. “Every day, the Russians are coming closer and closer,” said Vasyl Dovhan, 28, an attendant at the Nobilis Hotel in Lviv. “We are a bit scared, of course. But we are ready and united, and we will not surrender. We believe in Ukrainian forces and the international community is on our side. The world these days is finally watching the true face of the Russian regime, which will burn in hell for killing our innocent people.’’ One explanation for why Lviv has avoided strikes while neighbouring cities such as Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk have been bombed is that the Kremlin could have deliberately left the city’s motorway and railway links open to funnel refugees into Poland, deliberately focusing a massive refugee crisis on Ukraine’s neighbour. Whatever the reason, life on the streets of Lviv, the heart of the Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine (in contrast with the Russian Orthodox Christians) has gone on as usual despite now-daily air raid sirens. Singers continue to perform in the city’s streets and people get up and go to work just like any other day. Nevertheless, the war is still visible here in all of its tragic proportions: thousands of displaced people seeking shelter arrive every day at the railway station from eastern cities being razed to the ground by airstrikes. At least 200,000 internally displaced people currently call Lviv home, stretching the city’s capacity to its limits. ‘’We’re using all our facilities to shelter them,” says the deputy mayor of Lviv, Andriy Moskalenko. ‘’Universities, churches, factories have opened their doors to the displaced. And we’ll continue to do so, because we have an obligation towards them. We will not let them down. At the same time, our resources are not infinite.’’ The newest arrivals are coming from Kyiv and Kharkiv, where the bombings have been going on for days. Compared to the destroyed eastern villages, Lviv remains relatively safe. ‘’I was in Kyiv during the the first days of the war, which I mostly spent in a shelter or a hallway, and I no longer respond to air raid sirens,’’ said Tetyana Teren, 35, a journalist and the executive director of PEN Ukraine, the local branch of the free speech and authors’ rights NGO. Many people in Lviv believe the recent bombings in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, about two hours away, carry at least two messages. The first is that the Russian advance could rapidly expand westward soon. The second is that no area of Ukraine, Lviv included, is safe. Since the invasion began, Lviv has rapidly transformed into a garrison town. It is the centre of the country’s nationalist movement and, with its civil airport and military airfield, residents fear it may soon be in Russia’s sights. “After five days of calm, we have started to hear air raid sirens again,’’ says Moskalenko. “We know that at any moment they could strike us, too. We have seen how the Russians are capable of bombing hospitals, of killing defenseless children and women. We have seen what they have done in Mariupol and we are prepared for different scenarios, including a potential attack on the heart of our city.” During the advance of Russian troops on Kiev, foreign embassies have been transferred to Lviv, transforming the city into yet another symbol – that of the diplomatic capital of Ukraine and of the western response. Founded in the mid-13th century, Lviv was a royal city of the kingdom of Poland and its second-richest city. Its churches, streets and buildings reflect its rich history and culture. The idea that this magnificent town could be razed to the ground by bombs is unbearable for its people, and many remain convinced that Putin would never bomb a city with such an immeasurable artistic and cultural heritage. The rest consider Lviv at war already, and are making preparations for a Russian attack. At the city gates, teenagers fortify checkpoints with sandbags and volunteers queue to join the military. A metallurgical plant, specialising in copper cables, is producing anti-tank obstacles. University students are sewing camouflage nets for the army. “Lviv remains the safest place in Ukraine,’’ says Nazar Vdovyhenko, 19, a waiter in a cafe in the city centre. “Since the Russians invaded our country, we have been making preparations for this event for the entire time. We have our territorial defence, we have checkpoints, and finally we have the people’s resistance. And we will fight. We will fight the Russians back.’’",News/Global development,‘We are ready and united’: Lviv residents prepare for Russian advance ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/ukraine-lviv-residents-prepare-for-russian-advance
3/12/2022,"In 1997, the first Gran Turismo became famous for its graphic realism. It was not uncommon to see crowds gathered around display screens in high-street shops, gawping at the seemingly impossible level of detail seen in its replays. Twenty-five years on, players have become inured to such things. Yes, Gran Turismo 7’s cornucopia of cars gleam with weighty authenticity. Yes, you can pick out each individual stitch on a leather steering wheel, and catch the reflection of the car’s interior on the inside of the windshield as you corner into the sun. Yes, all this blazing realism helps fool the brain that you are there, in the driver’s seat of a million-dollar racing car, or a mint condition DeLorean, or a Toyota AE86. But this game’s true wonders run much deeper. The 54-year-old racing car driver Kazunori Yamauchi, creator of the Gran Turismo series, has always viewed this, his life’s work, as something more than a handsome-looking video game. With each instalment he has expanded and refined an interactive encyclopaedia of motor-racing, contextualising each vehicle in its manufacturer’s history, providing commentary and insight into the significance of different models, producing an inhabitable document of both an industry and a sport. Gran Turismo 7 is without doubt the team’s most complete and focused attempt yet: a stately, reverent, almost evangelistically nerdish celebration of motorsport. It takes time to adjust to Yamauchi’s way of doing things – especially for any players dizzy from the saccharine exuberance of rival racing games such as Forza Horizon. Gran Turismo 7 forces you to obtain licences before you can race, to wash your cars and perform oil checks, maintenance and servicing, and save up your money to buy new vehicles from secondhand car dealers. It sounds tedious, but these slow-release charms combine, with time, into a powerful spell. The game’s missions are doled out, inexplicably, by the owner of a forest cafe. Typically, he tasks you with completing three competitive races to collect a trio of related cars: Japanese front-wheel racers, French hot hatches, American muscle cars and so on. Implausibly, the other cafe patrons include top real-world car designers and experts who provide brisk lessons and titbits of information on any of the hundreds of cars you collect. Any vehicle in your expanding collection can be enhanced with upgrades and then taken online, where you can compete with other drivers from around the world, each race captured in Gran Turismo’s famous sumptuous replays. Poor behaviour on the track goes on your permanent record, and so, just as the game carefully teaches the first principles of racing, Yamauchi teaches his players trackside manners. As our everyday real-life cars are increasingly powered by batteries and run on upgradable operating systems, they become more like smartphones, in that obsolescence seems written into their being. In a world awakening to the existential threats posed by the climate crisis, Gran Turismo 7 is arguably an unfashionable game. But it provides a delicious snapshot of a century’s worth of motoring, delivered with the warmth of a lifelong devotee whose passion, as expressed through this game, is irresistible.",Arts/Games,"Gran Turismo 7 review – a reverent, nerdish celebration of motorsport",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/mar/12/gran-turismo-7-25th-anniversary-edition-review-ps5-kazunori-yamauchi
3/12/2022,"We’re in a golden age of grifter TV, with Amanda Seyfried as blood-test scammer Elizabeth Holmes in The Dropout, and the shocking Netflix rom-con doc The Tinder Swindler. Not to mention Inventing Anna, the Neftlix/Shonda Rhimes telling of the story of Anna Delvey (AKA Sorokin), the fake heiress who scammed her way through Manhattan society. She’s also inspired a book, a podcast, a play, and an art installation. Don’t read your reviews – weigh them. Inventing Anna is based on a 2018 New York magazine article by Jessica Pressler. In 2019, another Pressler piece was turned into Lorene Scafaria’s film Hustlers, about a group of strippers who stripped their wealthy clients of their assets. Jennifer Lopez was excellent as the hustler-in-chief. J-Lo is on a good run, not least in the reboot of her “Bennifer” relationship with Ben Affleck. The original 2000s iteration is revisited in the new podcast Just Like Us. Before Bennifer, there was Paltfleck (not an actual title), when he dated Gwyneth Paltrow, whom he met when they starred in Shakespeare in Love. Hollywood royalty she may be – Steven Spielberg is her godfather – but Paltrow had to start somewhere, and this included an uncredited cameo in John Singleton’s 1995 campus drama Higher Learning. The film is flawed, but it has an impressive ensemble cast with Omar Epps, Ice Cube, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly, Laurence Fishburne and Michael Rapaport. In 2000, Rapaport was in Spike Lee’s provocative blackface satire, Bamboozled. A year earlier, Lee made Summer of Sam, about serial killer David Berkowitz – AKA Son of Sam. Fast forward several decades, and you get to Netflix’s Inventing Anna deal. Sorokin was reportedly paid $320,000 for her life story, although New York’s Son of Sam law was invoked, which stops convicted criminals profiting from publicity about their misdeeds. Most of the money has been paid out to her victims. Watch There’s solid swindling in Stephen Frears’ 1990 neo-noir The Grifters, or from Rosamund Pike in I Care A Lot, with a deliciously amoral turn from Rosamund Pike.

3/12/2022,"Ministers should consider extending the plan to give a fourth dose of Covid vaccines to older people because of evidence of waning immunity, scientists say. The number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid began rising last week, and on 9 March 1,521 were admitted in England – the highest number since the end of January. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that one in 25 people, or 3.8% of England’s population, was infected on 5 March, and research by the React-1 study indicated that cases are rising in those aged 55 and over. Scientists say the rise is because the BA.2 version of Omicron is more transmissible, more people are mixing socially and the effectiveness of booster vaccines is starting to wane. Sajid Javid, England’s health secretary, announced last month that immunocompromised people, care home residents and anyone aged at least 75 would be offered a fourth dose of a vaccine in April, after advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. The new data shows that the government should reconsider, said Penny Ward, visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London. “The slow start of [the fourth dose] campaign now means the most vulnerable group are already at least six months away from their third shot at this point,” she said. “The government needs to consider carefully whether they should acquire further doses of antivirals to treat a broader proportion of the vulnerable elderly group and accelerate an additional booster campaign to try to reverse this.” Stephen Griffin, associate professor in the School of Medicine at Leeds University, said he was concerned by the rising numbers in hospital. “We are not in a stable situation,” he said. “As the virus changes and our immunity drops, we are going to start encountering these problems. People are mixing more and not taking precautions. “Vaccines are at the core of our strategy but they shouldn’t be the only thing in it. If you’re faced with no other choice, and the only control you have is vaccination, then [boosting] is what you have to do. But if we start giving fourth, fifth, sixth vaccinations while the rest of the world isn’t getting any, then that is a problem in itself.” The latest data from the UK Health Security Agency shows that for people of all age groups who received a Pfizer booster, the vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission drops from around 90% to 75% within three months. A study of people aged 75 and over found that vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation fell to 88% within the first three months. It is not clear how effective a fourth dose would be. Israel began offering fourth doses after Omicron was identified, but a study of 274 Israeli healthcare workers found that the extra shot restored levels of some antibodies but did not provide any extra immunity. Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the vaccine group at Oxford University, which developed the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, said that because most of the population was vaccinated, those people would only find Covid infections to be inconvenient and unpleasant. “It was expected and inevitable there would be a rise in infections once restrictions were relaxed and social contact increased,” he added. “The appearance of better-spreading variants will also contribute.” But he expressed concern for vulnerable individuals who could not be vaccinated, and those with underlying health conditions: “For this group waning immunity is a factor because they need such high levels of immunity to prevent these destabilising infections,” he said. Hospitalisation data does not show how many people in these groups are affected or those who are admitted for other reasons, Pollard said. “There will be a lot more of these incidental infections in hospitalised patients when there is a lot in the community. So, we should be more attentive to the details behind the headlines on cases and hospitalisation as this will better direct the appropriate actions on treatment of those who have COVID-19 disease, vaccination of those for whom there may be a benefit – including a further dose where deemed necessary – and no action where it is appropriate.” Susan Hopkins, the health security agency’s chief medical adviser, said: “Covid-19 is still circulating at high levels due to the high transmissibility of current variants and expected increases in social mixing. “While rates of severe disease and death due to Covid-19 remain low, there has been a recent rise in hospital admissions and we will continue to monitor this data closely. “Vaccination remains our first and best line of defence against illness, and it’s vital that everyone has had their latest dose. We can all help reduce transmission by wearing a face covering in crowded or enclosed spaces, washing hands regularly and keeping rooms well ventilated.”",News/World news,Call to offer more people fourth jab as Covid rises in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/call-to-offer-more-people-fourth-jab-as-covid-rises-in-england
