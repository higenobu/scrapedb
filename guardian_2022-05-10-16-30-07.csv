5/10/2022,"Liz Truss is reportedly preparing draft legislation that would unilaterally scrap key parts of the Northern Ireland protocol removing the need for checks on goods between Britain and Northern Ireland. No bill is expected to be announced in the Queen’s speech on Tuesday but the UK foreign secretary is reported to have asked officials to prepare the draft, which would put the UK in breach of its treaty obligations. As well as scrapping checks, the draft legislation would also take away powers of the European court of justice and remove all requirement for Northern Irish businesses to follow EU regulations. Some cabinet ministers, including the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, were said to be uneasy about the high stakes involved in Truss’s strategy and the possibility of a trade war with the EU as the UK stands on the brink of a potential recession. Cabinet sources suggested Truss’s manoeuvres were part of “leadership feather-fluttering” – hinting they were designed to put her at odds with Sunak in the minds of Conservative backbenchers. Sources close to Gove and Sunak denied they were trying to put a block on Truss’s plans. The draft bill was initially understood to be intended to grant ministers the power in principle to override the treaty – but not necessarily to be used in practice. However, the Times reported on Tuesday that the bill would go further than expected and explicit scrap parts of the protocol. Such a move is expected to spark legal retaliation by the EU were it to go ahead – including the EU potentially imposing new tariffs. Truss will argue that the election results in Northern Ireland give the negotiations a fresh sense of urgency because the Democratic Unionist party has said it will boycott any participation in a new government at Stormont until the issue is resolved. Sinn Féin, which won the most seats at Stormont for the first time, said Northern Ireland was becoming “collateral damage” in the dispute. A government spokesperson said: “Our focus has been, and will continue to be, preserving peace and stability in Northern Ireland. No decisions have yet been taken on the way forward. However, the situation is now very serious. “We have always been clear that action will be taken to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement if solutions cannot be found to fix the protocol.”",News/UK news,Liz Truss ‘preparing to tear up Northern Ireland protocol’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/liz-truss-preparing-to-tear-up-northern-ireland-protocol-reports
5/10/2022,"Australia’s foreign intelligence service will recruit new spies “with more vigour and urgency” than ever before as it seeks to counter adversaries who are “seeking to weaken our institutions and bend our values”. In a rare public address, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (Asis) director general, Paul Symon, addressed a range of topics related to Australia’s foreign intelligence operations, including suggestions an increasing number of disillusioned Chinese officials are assisting Asis, as well as the recent Solomon Islands-China security pact. Speaking at the Sydney event, hosted by the Lowy Institute to mark Asis’ 70th anniversary, he said the audience, which included high ranking members of Australia’s intelligence community and top diplomats, would have to “occasionally read between the lines”. Symon said his organisation needed to “remain low profile but … not have no profile” as it seeks to adapt to the modern intelligence gathering environment. “The world is experiencing more than just a realignment in power. The global rules-based order is being manipulated and subverted. The future will likely be less advantageous to Australia than that we once knew.” He said emerging technologies are posing “a near-existential” risk to the work of services such as Asis, with Australia’s covert activities becoming “increasingly discoverable”. “As we move forward, Asis will need more officers with more diverse skills and backgrounds supported by more integrated capabilities. We are going to need to recruit and work with even more vigour and urgency than at any other point in our 70-year history. “At the same time as our operating environment has become more competitive and volatile, it has also become increasingly difficult to conduct human intelligence work,” he said. Symon said officers “might be one of your family members, one of your neighbours, your classmates or former colleagues” and depending on the city “might just be the person next to you on the train”. “Right now, I know, somewhere out there … Asis officers are working on strange streets, in bustling cafes, or hidden from plain view.” Symon said that while human intelligence “remains a core component of statecraft, it must adapt to meet the extraordinary challenges arising from the interaction of a complex strategic environment, intensified counter-intelligence efforts, and emergent and emerging technologies.” “For a service like my own there is a near-existential dimension to technology risk. The analogue systems and processes which spies of the past took for granted have been relegated to history, and we now live in a fundamentally digital era where our covert activities are increasingly discoverable. In this technological sandbox, authoritarian regimes are having a ‘heyday’.” Symon also revealed that Asis “inserted” a “small team” of officers into Afghanistan as the Taliban seized power last year, including officers in the “chaos” of crowds seeking to leave the country at Kabul’s international airport, as they facilitated evacuations. Symon also appeared to suggest that Chinese officials and residents are increasingly looking to provide Asis with intelligence. In a conversation with Michael Fullilove, executive director of the Lowy Institute, Symon was asked how Asis gains human intelligence without coercion, and predicted that more “officials, individuals unhappy with the trajectory of closed societies are willing to speak up, are willing to take risks”. Symon compared China with India where he said “the diversity in the colour of ancient culture…and the extent to which that diversity is so rich and so alive”. “And yet in China, we have an ancient culture but there’s an enforced monoculture that’s being enforced. We don’t yet know exactly how that will play out. But what we’re seeing is more and more signs of officials (and) individuals interested in a relationship.” “That’s not coercion, that is very real concern about their culture, the lack of diversity in their culture and the direction that they’re heading in,” Symon said. Symon was asked how Asis factors ethical and legal questions into its operations, with Fullilove noting the East Timor spying controversy. Symon did not address East Timor directly – which occurred before his time as director general – but said that for officers who decide to opt-out of an operation because they’re uncomfortable about a task or hold concerns with its legality, he has given them an undertaking that it will not be detrimental to their career. “It doesn’t happen in great numbers, it happens occasionally,” Symon said, adding that these officers will sometimes then speak with an ethics counsellor and opt back in to an operation. Symon was also asked about the security pact signed between China and Solomon Islands. Symon had travelled to Honiara for urgent talks with the prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, before the deal was signed. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Speaking about the state of democracies generally, Symon said “what I do see, not so much in Australia, but I see in our region, the extent to which the democratic systems in our region can be manipulated”. “Political leaders can be subverted, can be directed and controlled, can take advantage of largesse that has been showered upon them. Our job really is to help the government know and understand exactly what is going on and as people are commenting, denying, responding to activities of, I won’t say coercion, but manipulation. “It’s important that we reveal for our government that they know and understand exactly what is happening in that area,” Symon said. Symon also pointed to Australia sending troops and federal police to Honiara at the request of the government as it faced unrest in November. “For me, the approach that we took in that very rapid period of time, typified the way that we look to support the Solomon Islands and it’s not what I see other countries in the way other countries are considering the type of support they wish to give the Solomon Islands,” he said. “For me, that’s what good looks like.” Symon suggested the intelligence community had been “very seized” by the security pact with China, and that Asis would continue gathering and sharing intelligence relevant to Solomon Islands.",News/Australia news,Australia to recruit more spies as adversaries ‘subvert rules-based order’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/australia-to-recruit-more-spies-as-adversaries-subvert-rules-based-order
5/10/2022,"Plant diseases are at their lowest levels in the UK for years because of a cold, dry spring, meaning it could be a bumper year for apples, and popular blooms such as iris are likely to be spectacular. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) said years like this may be few and far between in the future, as the climate becomes warmer and wetter, creating ideal conditions for pests. But this year, spring favourites such as quince and hawthorn are doing well, with gardener queries to the charity about plant diseases on their plots down 45% on last year. Diseases including powdery mildew and fungal leaf spot have been kept at bay this year as there has not been the warm, wet or humid weather that encourages their spread. But that is the climate predicted for the UK in coming years. The weather has been good news for Chelsea flower show, which takes place at the end of the month, as the unsightly fungal leaf spot is at its lowest levels in six years. It typically afflicts plants commonly seen at the horticulture show, including lupins and bearded iris. Disease inquiries in general are at their lowest level for three years, when they were on the increase during humid springs. The RHS said that with showers predicted and the weather getting sunnier, there could be a surge in pests and diseases, and it has warned gardeners to keep an eye out for telltale signs of plant damage. The charity advises mulching plants to help retain moisture levels and ensuring good air flow around plants such as roses, gooseberries and honeysuckle, which are vulnerable particularly if grown against walls or fences. Dry spells are known to increase plant stress, which means they are more susceptible to diseases including honey fungus, the most prevalent plant disease in the UK. Liz Beal, a plant pathologist at the RHS, said: “Reports of common garden diseases such as powdery mildew and fungal leaf spot are at low levels this year after a mild and dry start to the growing season. While this stands to benefit popular May blooms such as lupins, hawthorn and bearded iris, gardeners should consider the impact a change in the weather could have on their carefully cultivated plants. Prevention is always better than cure, so ensuring our gardens are healthy year-round is an important consideration for the UK’s 30 million gardeners.” Experts at the charity expect this year to be somewhat of an aberration as a warming climate means plants are more likely to experience stress and become more vulnerable to disease. A changing climate could also make gardens attractive to new, imported problems. The RHS has historically labelled some wildlife in gardens, including slugs and snails, as pests and advised gardeners on how to get rid of them. But now it is focusing on teaching wildlife-friendly horticulture and tackling more pressing matters including the rise of invasive species and plant disease due to global heating. The charity recently said it recommended a more relaxed approach to slugs and snails, pointing out that although they eat plants they are important to garden ecosystems.",News/Environment,Boon for blooms as UK’s dry spring keeps plant diseases at bay,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/10/uk-dry-spring-keeps-plant-diseases-at-bay-rhs
5/10/2022,"About four years ago, as the 2017-18 Ashes reached Perth, someone organised a game of football between the travelling English media and their West Australian counterparts. We assembled on some nondescript piece of suburban scrubland, the standard was extremely mixed and after Michael Vaughan slotted home the winning penalty we all retired to the bar for the most important business of the day. As we sat there with our schooners, a local women’s team was heading out to train on the pitch we had just vacated. One of them was incredible. She had feet like hands. She had a head like a foot. She had a shot like the lash of a velociraptor’s tail. Clearly, I extrapolated, this woman was destined for bigger things. Bigger stages. Someone needed to discover her, find her an agent, get her a trial and a boot deal. I hastily made inquiries behind the bar. “That’s Sam Kerr, mate,” the barman said, carefully siphoning off another jar of frothy water. “She’s the best player in the world.” Something about this felt incongruous, strange, vaguely wrong on some level. How is it that the world’s greatest footballer has to share a pitch with a bunch of middle-aged cricket journalists? How is it right that Sam Kerr (Australia international, NWSL golden boot winner) has to use the same patch of grass as Jonathan Liew (falls over when trying to use left foot)? And most pressingly of all, we were in the presence of greatness. Why weren’t we clambering over each other to watch it? I thought about that scorching afternoon in Perth while watching Kerr fire Chelsea to the Women’s Super League title on a scintillating final day of the season. In a way, everything about her – the adhesive touch, the movement, the sweet strike of the ball – was the same. And yet everything around her – the stage, the stakes, the crowd of more than 4,000 and the burning glare of a global television audience – was different. The second goal. Can we talk about the second goal? Mary Earps, the Manchester United goalkeeper, makes a long clearance. Guro Reiten heads it back towards the D. Kerr controls the ball on her chest, spins on the spot and sends an unstoppable dipping volley over Earps and into the net. Thanks for coming, everyone. Even she can't believe she scored that!Another UNREAL strike from @samkerr1 😱 pic.twitter.com/6qYGcee4cn But actually, the goal is even better when you watch it back. Because while Reiten’s header is looping towards her, Kerr glances over her shoulder to check Earps’s position. Or, put another way: Kerr manages to spin and volley the ball in from 25 yards, and she hasn’t even been looking at it the whole time. Can you conceive the difficulty level of that? She didn’t think. She just knew. Then again, this has been one of the defining themes of Kerr’s career. Afterwards, she revealed she had predicted the goal in advance to her teammates, visualised it, trained for it. And what really marks Kerr out is not so much her talent but her conviction, the utter certainty – in the face of overwhelming historical and cultural odds – that she would be where she is today. Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter! For most of our lives, the inevitability of footballing talent was almost invariably been a male privilege. “He was always destined to be a star,” you read in soft-focus features about male players: the unspoken assumption that once natural gift meets hard work it will find its platform, that the justice of the marketplace will reward them appropriately. But with a few isolated exceptions – athletics, perhaps tennis – no such assumption has ever existed in women’s sport. The rewards have been too meagre, the opportunities too scarce, the prejudice too strong. Throughout history there will have been female athletes of abundant talent whose names we will never know and who never earned a penny for their efforts. Boys knew that if they were good enough, they’d make it. Girls knew that good enough might still never be enough. Blessed with sporting genes and an unwavering belief in her own ability, Kerr always seemed to have more of an inkling than most. And yet it wasn’t until she first played for Australia at the age of 15 that she realised football could be her living. She questioned and doubted herself, even considered walking away from the sport. She arrived in London just a few weeks before the world shut down, leaving her adrift, alone and far from home. And so it is only really in the past year that we have seen Kerr at her most expressive: a warm, engaging presence off the pitch and a frightening, unstoppable presence on it. Even four years ago on that little pitch in Perth, there was no real precedent for what Kerr has now become: a genuine global star, an Australian icon, the face of the next World Cup. It was a reality she had to dream up and create for herself: built on her own hard graft and the graft of those who went before her. With a little luck, the next Sam Kerr will have a slightly easier time of it. A few months ago, during a Champions League game against Juventus, a man invaded the pitch at Kingsmeadow, interrupted the game and demanded a selfie with the Chelsea players. Nobody really knew what to do or how to react. Except Kerr, who took a run at the intruder and barged him to the ground. In more ways than one, it was a devastatingly powerful act. This is our pitch, she seemed to be saying. And we’re done sharing it.

5/10/2022,"On a filthy night three days before Christmas in 1978, I was sitting on a rather ancient coach travelling across the Pennines towards Lancashire, along with about 50 other football supporters. The Bradford branch of the Manchester United supporters club catered largely for a collection of brickies and other manual workers – and that evening we were all on our way to watch a dismal 0-3 defeat at Bolton. As torrential rain poured down on the M62, the bloke sitting immediately in front suddenly turned and, with a hint of menace, said to my brother and me: “You’re not really the same as us are you?” It may have been the drink talking after some seasonal revelry during the day, but his analysis was on the money. The sons of an academic and a teacher, Paul and I read different papers, watched different stuff on TV and spoke in a different way. But as aspiring young lefties in the late 1970s, we imagined, or hoped, that this divergence in terms of social class would be redeemed and erased by politics: after all, it was only 10 years after 1968, when radical students and workers attempted to dream a revolutionary alliance into being. So it was mortifying to my teenage self to realise that, even in the context of supporting the same football team, there might be an underlying suspicion towards the middle-class interlopers on the bus. This uncomfortable moment was a minor lesson in the tricky social dynamics of class and status. Almost half a century later, the future of progressive politics in Britain may depend on a similar kind of learning process writ large. The usual caveats (low turnout, protest voting, local factors) apply to any analysis of last week’s council elections. But in England, the broad picture appears to confirm a changing political landscape that, while it potentially poses deep problems for the Conservative party, also confronts Labour with challenging truths. To quote the Oxford University election analysts Michael Thrasher and Colin Rallings: “The urban south is becoming more Labour as the north hangs on to its post-Brexit attachment to the Tories … but there is evidence too of a new demographic cleavage. Areas where more than a third of the population are university graduates swung sharply to Labour, those where graduates are thinner on the ground moved almost as much the other way.” Two demographies, two economies and, increasingly, two sensibilities. On one side, liberal-minded, Labour-voting urban professionals and young graduates clustered disproportionately in the cities; on the other, elements of the post-industrial working class (some of it retired) who mourn the loss of something that has disappeared in towns that are steadily getting older. If it cannot do much better among this second group, Labour will not win a majority in the next election. Even the success of a progressive alliance with the Lib Dems and the Greens depends on Labour doing its job in the “red wall”. But despite notable successes, such as its victories in Cumberland and Kirklees, the hoped-for revival in the north and Midlands stuttered and stalled last week to an extent that allowed Boris Johnson to brazen out an otherwise terrible night. Viewed through a purely economic lens, some of the results might appear inexplicable. Polls indicate that a majority of the public views the government’s response to the cost of living crisis as woefully inadequate. But in one of the most deprived wards in Walsall – where one in five households are fuel poor – there was a 35% swing to the Conservatives. While red wall type areas will suffer disproportionately in the hard times to come, it would therefore seem unwise for Labour to rely on attacking the government to solve the problem of its soured relations with the traditional working class. Instead, perhaps the left should widen the horizon of its analysis to address the kind of question that my fellow United fan put to me on the coach to Bolton. Why do substantial numbers of former Labour voters sense a cultural gulf between themselves and what they think the party now represents? Why do they feel Labour is “not the same” as them any more? Last year, the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank published an important paper co-written by the sociologist and social mobility expert John Goldthorpe. Entitled Meritocracy and Populism, a section of it summarises two main findings from red wall focus groups convened by Deborah Mattinson (now Labour’s director of strategy). The first was that these (predominantly leave) voters felt that good jobs and opportunities for younger people were no longer available in their communities. A sense of grievance at this was compounded by the perception that, as old industries had faded away, the world now belonged to new generations of degree-holders who, bluntly, looked down on them. Politically, write Goldthorpe and his co-author, Erzsébet Bukodi, such views “translated into a deep disillusionment with the Labour party. This was seen as now dominated by graduate, metropolitan elites – whether Blairite or Corbynite – obsessed with political correctness and more concerned with telling the people they were supposed to represent that they were ‘wrong’ than with trying to understand the conditions under which they were living.” Depending on how things play out, Keir Starmer’s current woes over ”Beergate” – feeding a narrative of elite hypocrisy – could prove particularly damaging in this regard. This alienated perspective, which is almost certainly shared by large numbers of lost Labour voters, may be an unfair caricature. But if Labour is to bridge generational and educational divides in an era of culture wars, it should admit that there is a kernel of truth here. The mass expansion of higher education has helped Britain become a far better place when it comes to addressing, for example, race and gender inequality. But the widespread characterisation of Brexit as a purely xenophobic, reactionary project demonstrated that highly educated liberals are also capable of myopic intolerance. To reconstitute a relationship with leave-voting constituencies, Labour needs to do more than “move on” from 2016 and its aftermath, as Starmer has understandably but mistakenly sought to do. It needs to re-engage with why so much of its working-class support voted the way it did. A starting point for that exercise might be the seminal essay Culture is Ordinary, written by Raymond Williams in 1958. In it, Williams describes the postwar blue collar environment in which he grew up as defined by commitment to “neighbourhood, mutual obligation and common betterment”. Mattinson’s leave voters were evidently preoccupied by the perceived loss of this sense of solid community, and clearly ill at ease in an age of more freewheeling individualism. These are not in themselves reactionary sentiments; in fact they belong to a venerable Labour tradition that includes RH Tawney and William Morris. But in the context of Brexit, they were far too easily dismissed and misrepresented, and the scars from that are still there. If they are to be healed in the places where Labour so badly needs to reconnect, the modern left needs to travel outside its cultural comfort zone with an open mind, listen properly to the messages it receives, and admit that it can learn from the red wall as well as lecture it.

5/10/2022,"New South Wales flood recovery minister, Steph Cooke, has apologised for delays in getting relief money into flood-affected communities, while announcing changes to make it easier for small businesses to access grants. The government has been criticised after Service NSW data revealed just 2,445 of the 15,335 applications for small business grants had been approved, with 6,500 rejected and another 5,000 held up while the government seeks more information from the applicant. The Guardian on Tuesday documented the frustrations of small business owners in Lismore unhappy with the speed of the rollout and the criteria applied to the grants. Speaking on 2GB radio on Tuesday, Cooke lamented that “nothing goes perfectly” when a government tries to get $3bn in funding out the door, noting widespread fraud concern had slowed efforts. She revealed changes to the requirements for sole traders, who she said accounted for about half of the almost 6,500 businesses that had been rejected. “There is now a requirement for less paperwork, which is going to put money into the hands of those sole traders more quickly,” she said. “When problems emerge, like we have discovered with sole traders, that’s when we look to find that fix as quickly as we possibly can.” Sole traders have always been eligible for the grants, but have required additional documentation to other small businesses. With the changes they will now be able to seek initial approval by submitting a statutory declaration instead. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Lismore state MP, Labor’s Janelle Saffin, lashed the government over the complex processes being foised upon “traumatised” residents. “It’s no good for the government to say ‘we’re with you’ and then you don’t get the grant. They’ve just got to make sure it changes,” she said. “It’s a plea really, to the NSW government – get your act together, get the grants out, spend the money, open the chequebooks, we need it now. We need flexibility and we need compassion.” Saffin said she also supported land swaps and relocation of some parts of the badly affected north and south Lismore to higher ground, as was put forward by the Lismore council as part of a discussion paper exploring options for the town’s future. “I am supporting it. For now, it’s the government, state and federal, that have to support it,” Saffin said. “Next time the premier comes or the prime minister, whoever comes, open the chequebook so that we can look at those longer term options.” Opposition emergency services spokesperson Jihad Dib described the grants rollout as a “shemozzle” and called on the state government to assist people in putting applications in so the rejection rates were lower. “Individual case management is so incredibly important,” he said. “It’s also incredibly important to make sure that we provide the support that’s required to an individual that maybe doesn’t necessarily fit within the parameters of a box.” Cooke said the government was working “around the clock” to speed things up while ensuring applications were thoroughly checked. “I apologise to people who haven’t received money as quickly as they would like,” Cooke said. “We’re doing everything that we possibly can across the whole of government. “We have an obligation to make sure that we’ve got checks and balances in place when we’re assessing people’s applications because we know fraud is a huge issue.” Service NSW data also revealed that just 1,346 of the 9,570 applications for rental relief had been approved so far. More than half had been deemed ineligible and declined. Cooke said there were “complexities” in the scheme. “We are working through with both individuals and the families to find the best possible solution for their medium-to-long-term housing needs,” she said. “In order to take up the rental support scheme, you’ve got to have a place to move into. We’ve had a huge shortage of accommodation and other types of accommodation in the northern rivers.”",News/Australia news,Growing anger in flood zones prompts NSW government apology,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/growing-anger-in-flood-zones-prompts-nsw-government-apology
