12/15/2021,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — California is exempting San Francisco from a rule that takes effect Wednesday requiring all people to wear masks indoors in a bid to contain a troubling rise in new coronavirus cases. San Francisco will continue to allow fully vaccinated people to remove their masks in gyms and workplaces while its overall masking mandate remains in effect, the city Department of Public Health announced. “It’s a recognition of all of the thought and care that San Francisco residents have been putting into staying as safe as possible,” said Dr. Susan Philip, San Francisco’s health officer. About 86% of eligible San Francisco residents have received at least one vaccine dose, according to the public health department. San Francisco businesses were relieved that the city can continue permitting fully vaccinated people to go maskless in some indoor locations. “To have any disruption at all in the progress we’ve made over the last year and a half in getting customers back would have been devastating,” Dave Karraker, co-owner of MX3 Fitness and spokesman for the San Francisco Independent Fitness Studio Coalition, told the San Francisco Chronicle. Several other San Francisco Bay Area counties also had relaxed masking rules for vaccinated people but it wasn't immediately clear whether the state would exempt them, too. California lifted its statewide mask mandate on June 15 for people who were vaccinated, a date that Gov. Gavin Newsom heralded as the state’s grand reopening. But health officials are worried about the spread of the new omicron COVID-19 variant, which health officials believe can spread more easily than the original and delta strains. The virus is particularly hitting the unvaccinated. The new mandate, which will remain in force until at least Jan. 15, also is aimed at reducing the COVID-19 risk when friends and families travel or gather indoors for the holidays. However, officials haven't specified how it will be enforced and have acknowledged that much will depend on voluntary public compliance. After California lifted its statewide indoor mask mandate this summer, county governments covering about half of the state’s population imposed their own mandates as case rates surged with new variants. The order comes as the statewide seven-day average rate of new coronavirus cases has jumped 47% since Thanksgiving and hospitalizations have risen by 14%, according to the state Department of Public Health. That's still far below a surge last winter — before vaccines were available — when the state averaged more than 100 cases per 100,000 people and nearly 20,000 people died during an eight-week period. What's worrying now is that even though more than 70% of eligible Californians are fully vaccinated, some areas of the state still have low vaccination rates that put communities of greater risk for the coronavirus, according to the health department. “Given the current hospital census, which is at or over capacity, even a moderate surge in cases and hospitalizations could materially impact California’s health care delivery system within certain regions of the state,"" the department said. California joins other states with similar indoor mask mandates, including Washington, Oregon, Illinois, New Mexico, Nevada, Hawaii, and New York. California also is tightening existing testing requirements by ordering unvaccinated people attending indoor events of 1,000 people or more to have a negative test within one or two days, depending on the type of test. The state also is recommending travelers who visit or return to California to get tested within five days of their arrival.",U.S./Associated Press,California exempts San Francisco from COVID indoor mask rule,https://news.yahoo.com/california-exempts-san-francisco-covid-044226038.html
12/15/2021,"Historic tornadoes devastated the midwest, especially Kentucky. GOP Sen. Rand Paul sent a letter to President Joe Biden to ask for disaster relief. Critics were quick to call out his history of opposing disaster aid for other states. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul lashed out at critics who called him a hypocrite for requesting federal funds when his state was devasted by tornadoes, but he has a lengthy history of opposing disaster relief bills, The Washington Post reported. On Saturday, the morning after a storm created historic tornadoes, Paul wrote President Joe Biden a letter asking him to move ""expeditiously to approve the appropriate resources for our state."" The most damage and destruction hit Kentucky, with more than 70 people killed. Critics were quick to call out that the letter was in contrast to Paul's rigid opposition to federal disaster relief efforts in the past. ""We should do all we can to help our Kentucky neighbors. God be with them — they are hurting. But do not for one second forget that @RandPaul has voted against helping most Americans most times they're in need,"" Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell wrote in a tweet. —Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) December 12, 2021 Following Superstorm Sandy in 2013, Paul opposed a disaster relief measure for the Northeast and told WFPL that while the area needed help, he'd like to offset the cost with cuts elsewhere in the federal budget. ""I would have given them $9 billion and I would've taken the $9 billion from somewhere else,"" Paul said at the time.""I would have taken it from foreign aid and said you know what, we don't have money for Egypt or Pakistan this year because we have to help the Northeast."" In 2017, Paul opposed a disaster relief bill for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. ""People here will say they have great compassion and they want to help the people of Puerto Rico, the people of Texas, and the people of Florida but notice they have great compassion with someone else's money,"" Paul said in a speech on the Senate floor at the time. On Saturday Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar said she's glad Paul has finally realized that ""states needing federal assistance after a disaster isn't gritty, wasteful or being 'compassionate with someone else's money.'"" ""We are one Nation and should always be able to count on one another regardless of your state's politics. This is America,"" Omar said. Paul told the Post on Tuesday that he's routinely requested emergency aid for Kentucky and that he has ""never been opposed to the program, ever."" He said he was opposed to using ""borrowed"" money to fund disaster relief and not offsetting the cost elsewhere in the federal budget. ""That's different than saying, 'Oh, he now wants it because it's in his state and he never wanted it [before],' "" Paul told the Post. ""I've never opposed anybody's disaster relief in any other state. I've just asked that it be paid for."" In July, Paul also opposed the Gulf Coast Hurricane Aid Act, which would have given $1.1 billion in federal aid for people impacted by hurricanes Laura and Delta. That bill even had a financial offset of using some of the $80 billion in proceeds from a 2020 radio spectrum auction, the Post reported. While critics are lashing on to Paul's hypocrisy, lawmakers across the aisle have called for funds to help tornado victims. ""I have always voted for disaster aid, and we shouldn't hold it against disaster victims when their politicians are not doing their job,"" Democratic Sen. Richard Durbin, whose state of Illinois was also impacted by the tornado told the Post. Paul's office did not respond to Insider's request for comment at the time of publication.
