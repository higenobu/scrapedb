4/17/2022,"England have appointed Rob Key as their permanent managing director of men’s cricket. The former Kent captain has taken over from Andrew Strauss, who held the role on an interim basis after Ashley Giles’s sacking in February. The announcement from the England and Wales Cricket Board has come two days after Joe Root resigned as captain of the men’s Test side, and a significant early challenge for Key comes with deciding upon a replacement for the man who oversaw just one victory in England’s last 17 Tests. Despite the troubled landscape he finds himself parachuted into, Key said: “It is an absolute honour to take up this role. The chance to have an impact and make a difference is an opportunity given to very few and I will give it everything I have to try shape the next great era of English men’s cricket. “Although at this current moment it has been a challenging time in English cricket, I also think it’s as exciting a time as I can remember. With two of our teams near or at the top of the world rankings and an undoubted amount of talent in our game, I hope to try and bring everyone along for the ride so we can all help take English men’s cricket to new heights across all formats.” Key, 42, has worked as a commentator for Sky since his retirement from playing in 2015. Tom Harrison, the ECB’s chief executive, said: “Following a thorough recruitment process, Rob stood out in a very competitive field. His passion and knowledge of the game at domestic and international level is outstanding. “He is a proven leader and combines an approachable nature with fresh original thinking and resilience which will stand him in good stead. He will bring a lot to the role and I am sure players and staff alike will enjoy working with Rob. I have no doubt he will relish the challenge before us.” “I’d like to thank Andrew for agreeing to step back into the role on an interim basis. To have someone of his experience and skillset during the transition and recruitment process was invaluable. He remains a huge asset to English and Welsh Cricket.” As well as the captaincy, Key will also consider the way forward in terms of England’s coaching structure. The 2022-23 winter sees Test and white-ball tours overlap, which may call for separate head coaches for the two men’s teams. Key, in his role as a pundit, has previously advocated such a split, albeit for performance reasons. Speaking on Sky’s Cricket podcast in February, Key said: “I would split the coaching. Not because it’s a lot of work but because it’s two very different teams at two different times. The [white-ball] team could do with a facilitator coach who can just keep delivering what they’re doing but challenge them. The Test team needs a completely different style of coach – a driver of culture and environment. The biggest thing is the mentality, which I think has been very poor.” As well as scoring over 28,000 runs in his career, Key played 15 Tests, five one-day internationals and one T20 for England, and scored 221 in one innings of the first Test against West Indies at Lord’s in 2004. He also captained Kent in two spells from 2006-2012 and 2014-15.",Sport/Sport,‘An absolute honour’: England appoint Rob Key as director of men’s cricket ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/17/an-absolute-honour-england-appoint-rob-key-as-director-of-mens-cricket
4/17/2022,"Monday is expected to herald a drop in temperatures and rain for some areas of the UK at the end of an unseasonably warm Easter weekend. Temperatures were expected to reach the high teens on Sunday, with the possibility of even higher in the south after Good Friday was the warmest day of the year so far, with 23.4C recorded in St James’s Park in London – warmer than Ibiza. But cloudier skies were expected in the west on Sunday with outbreaks of rain across Northern Ireland and western Scotland edging slowly eastwards in a week that the UK Met Office said wouldbring a return to more normal weather for April, when the average temperature is about 12C. It predicted temperatures would start to drop from Easter Monday with some scattered rain and cloud moving in over the course of the week. Marco Petagna, a senior meteorologist at the Met Office, said rain would push in from the west overnight, which would be “weakening” as it went, so the east may stay dry. “The idea is temperatures gradually just creeping down each day for the next few days across the UK,” he said. “The farther south and south-east you go the better chances to stay fine again, but [it will be] slightly cooler [on Monday] at 19 in the south-east, low to mid-teens elsewhere.” Pollen levels – which have been high in most of the country, causing misery for those with hay fever – would begin to decrease in many areas from Monday onwards and Petagna said Easter Monday may be the last of the dry, bright weather for the week, which has seen moderate UV levels with the “sun as strong now as during August”. He said: “Tuesday and Wednesday could see a few showers, particularly across the south of the UK. And then the second half of the week is when we get an easterly wind developing, more in the way of cloud pushing in from the east with some patchy rain but still a lot of relatively dry weather too. “But the trend is certainly for temperatures to take a bit of a dip, so we’re sort of back down to low locally mid-single figures by Thursday.” The warm weather over the weekend coupled with it being the first Easter without lockdown restrictions for two years meant many people headed to the coast, with Bournemouth attracting some of the biggest crowds of the year and coastal car parks in Cornwall also packed with holidaymakers. People returning from weekend breaks have been advised by the RAC to either travel before 10.30am or after 6.30pm on Easter Monday to avoid queues.",News/UK news,UK weather: unseasonably warm Easter weekend temperatures set to end,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/17/uk-weather-unseasonably-warm-easter-weekend-temperature-end
4/17/2022,"In English-speaking cultures, why are Green, Brown, White, Black or Grey the only common surnames that are colours? I have never met or heard of anyone with a surname such as Red, Purple or Blue. Is this the case in other languages? Stephen Riley, Ann Arbor, Michigan Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. All the purple people were eaten. TopGyre The late Rabbi Lionel Blue is an example. Perhaps someone knows the origin of the name? Janchan According to the rabbi himself, it was the other way round. Father came to England and needed a new surname. Noticed people called Brown, Black, etc. Personally he liked the colour blue, so took that name, only later to realise that no one else was called Blue. Pedant27A Blue is a surname! Just ask Mrs Blue, my great granny. More common in Scotland than England, though. Regularsubscriber One of the best blue names is Harald Bluetooth, a Viking king. Oddly, Bluetooth technology is named after him. ClaretEile Weirdly, there seems to be a concentration of Reds around Inverness. Yellows in Yorkshire, Purples in Norfolk and Blues in the mountains of Mourne, too ... Svalborealis What about Miss Scarlett and Colonel Mustard? DrEd Years ago, I worked in the MoD in Whitehall. There was a yellow directory that listed the names and numbers of people who worked in the MoD, including officers. One day, a colleague and myself were bored and going through it. We discovered a Captain Scarlet. So we rang him up. He picked up the phone and said: “Hello, this is Captain Scarlet.” To which I replied in a very deep voice: “This is the voice of the Mysterons. We know that you can hear us,” and then quickly put the phone down. Very childish but we laughed for hours. THeEgoHasLanded Actually, there is and English surname that means red. It’s Gough derived from the Welsh word for the colour red, “coch”. Berwyn Roderick Rogers comes from the french rouge or Rougier as a name so we do have red. fworcs The surname Russell is also believed to be derived from the Norman rus, meaning red (red-haired), and also an archaic name for a red fox. MrsLessing Were not the Norse Rus (red-haired Viking ancestors of the Normans) also responsible for the founding of Rus-sia (in Kyiv)? How appropriate that the Russians subsequently became the “reds”. ITGuyReader My surname is Redhead, so I get the comments about my red hair. It’s a Viking nickname, and the family hail from Northumbria, one of the areas where they landed and lived. My mum’s maiden name is also colour-based: Fairhurst. Julia Redhead My mind went immediately to Red Cloud, the Oglala Lakota chief. Now, of course, his name originated in the Lakota language, but the United States is an English-speaking culture, and Red Cloud was his name in that language. There was also Red Shirt, from the same people. David Antrobus The surname Reid/Read/Reade comes from the Anglo-Saxon for red, and probably referred to hair colour. Red and russet are common surnames in other countries: Leroux, Rosso/Rossi. Black refers to swarthy skin, or black hair; and maybe Brown, too: Lenoir and Lebrun in French. A famous German soprano had the surname Schwarzkopf, referring to black hair. Gray/Grey refers to hair or beard colour, and is a translation from a fairly common Irish or Gaelic surname. (The surname Glass is a transliteration of Irish glás, which can mean grey, blue or green according to context.) Green(e) refers to the verdure where someone lived: Verdi is a famous Italian name. German has a variety of surnames containing Grün. Yellow is not an Anglophone surname, but French has LeJaune. Viol[l]et is also a French surname. Anthony Weir Black was common for blacksmiths, Brown for tanners, White for clothmakers, so we were told in school. lissameliss From around the 12th century, surnames developed from patronymics or matronymics, occupation, nicknames, proximity to a place, whether a local landmark or a named village or town, and descriptions. So Brown, White, Black or Grey easily came from hair colour, complexion – or, in the case of Grey and White, age. The derivation of a surname may be concealed by its being from an occupation no longer common, or in an old form of English or from, say, Norman French. So a Fletcher was an arrow-maker, a Chapman was a pedlar and one called Atwood someone living atte (near) a wood. Mallory seems to be Anglo-Norman for “unlucky”! (My own surname suggests that wool-carding ancestors never bothered to progress to being Weavers, Websters or Webbers.) Jane Matilda Thick European family names are often derived from personal characteristics, such as hair colour or trade. Some names are obvious, like Carpenter or Baker, Short or Long. Some colours might be either. Black might be colouring or could be the trade of a Blacksmith. White could be the colour or, a trade name that fell out of use long ago, a Whitesmith, who worked with tin or lead. Green or other place names such as Hill are mostly assumed to be where they lived, as in village green. But there might be a suggestion of trade as for a greengrocer. leadballoon A Green I knew – his family were originally Greenbaum – was Jewish. A lot of Jews are Green-something or Gold-something, or even Roth-something, relating to their profession. Some of them in the UK shortened their names, especially during the first world war, when they were perceived as possibly being German due to their German-sounding surnames, and therefore likely to get their shop windows smashed. ohanyname Hate to ask a stupid question, but where are all the blondes? If we’re pinning much of this down to hair colour, the browns, blacks, whites, greys and reds/Reids/Rosses seem to fit the formula, but where are the blondes? CDAEvans Blond(e) is the French term, so not established as an English name. elitemetropolitain Perhaps found in family names with “fair” in them? Mornex74 My middle name, Boyd, means blond or yellow. alexito The UK phone directory includes surnames such as Puce, Mint, Cerise, Cornflower and Mulberry. loudmouth No one ever seems to have been called Beige. SpleendeParis Gorm is often a nickname in Scottish Gaelic, blue-eyed (gorm in nature can also mean dark or matt). The surname Gormley might be it; it would follow the pattern that makes Donal(d) into Donnelly in English spelling. coultetscandi In Italy we have as surnames: Bianchi (white), Neri (black), Verdi (green), Viola (violet), Marrone (brown), Porpora (purple), Rosa (pink), Rossi (red), but no grey. Annina Lubbock Rossi (red) is thought to be the most common surname. However, I have not heard of Blu or Azzurri (blue) or Gialli (yellow). Viola (purple) does exist, though. Paolo Tomasi There are several colourful surnames in Spanish: Añil (indigo), Blanco (white), Castaño (chestnut), Celeste (light blue), Dorado (golden), Monegro (contraction of Montenegro: black hill), Moreno (brown), Negrín (little black), Pardo (brown), Rojas (red), Rosado (pink), Rubio (blond), Morado (purple). Jordi P Amezcua In French, it is much the same as in English, except that Red is more common: Roux, Leroux, etc. Otherwise: Blanc, Leblanc, Blondel. Noir, Lenoir, Noiret. Lebrun, Brun. In German, Braun and Schwarz are obviously common. Blau is quite common as a name in German, I think (can also mean drunk). The red may be more subtle: Rotmund. But then again Schwarzkopf or Weisskopf are pretty clear. In a traditional areas of rural Switzerland, until recently it was common for (white) people to hold up a piece of their hair and say: “je suis noir” simply to emphasise that they might be easily recognised through their hair colour. Derek Christie, Geneva Rood (red) and Blauw (blue) occur as surnames in the Netherlands. Also Groen (green), Geel (yellow), Oranje (orange). Willem Driessen In Dutch, Paars (purple) doesn’t exist as a surname, though Purper and especially Purperhart (purple heart) is a common surname from Suriname. skdeurloo Hereditary surnames were common in the Catholic south but not so much in the Protestant north. When the Netherlands was occupied by the French, Napoleon ordered a census and everyone had to give a family name. As an act of rebellion, many offered rather rude names which were dutifully noted down and still exist today. Names such as Poepjes (little shit), Naaktgeboren (born naked) and Naaktinhetveld (naked in the field). Omontaise In Danish, we have brown, white … but not blue or pink. Anders In Norway, Rød (red) is a fairly common surname, although it has nothing to do with the colour. Rød means “a place that has been cleared” eg in the woods, to make space for a farm and a plot of arable land. hildepilde In Czech, there is blue (Modry), there is almost a purple (Fiala – whereas fialovy means purple). And Zeleny (green) is very common, you might recognise a famous holder of a similar name in current events (Zelenskiy). BlairwasagoodPM In Romanian, Roşu (meaning red) is a surname, too. My conjecture is that these colour surnames are based on the most common colours encountered in a specific culture. For example, red is very common in Romania’s national folk costumes. We don’t have Grey and Brown as surnames; only Red, Black, White and rarely Green. Maria-Luiza Apostolescu Roussos and Roussakis (red) as well as Kitrinos/Kitrinakis (yellow) are common Greek surnames. sirah7767 The common Chinese name Huang means yellow. Joe, Canada 蓝 (lán) meaning blue can be a family name in China. Liuzhoukaf Hong? Red, I seem to remember. Must admit I don’t personally know anyone with that name though. BluebellWood Long ago in Japan, the Lady Murasaki wrote what is said to be the world’s first novel. In Japanese, murasaki means purple. Janchan And the Japanese surname Akai means red. KrisW1001 Someone (Victor Borge or PDQ Bach, I forget which) liked to point out that famous Italian composers Giuseppe Verdi and Gioachino Rossetti are less highbrow sounding as Joe Green and Jake Red. There’s a noted American Sherlockian, Peter Blau, whose name is German for Blue. Less common, certainly, but there are some. I’d imagine that Brown, White, and Black (and Grey) originally are descriptors of skin tones (or maybe hair colours – although you’d expect more reds and some yellows, in that case), and green an occupational name for someone dealing with growing plants. The main sources of last names are personal descriptions, occupations, patronymics and places-of-origin. The list of names sent out for picking from by the Kaiser were more variegated with lots of names such as goldstone, redstone, feather or bearman that probably came off the list without any particular connection to the recipient. You get a lot of reds and yellows in with all those goldens and rosens. Bernstein means amber, but isn’t the colour amber – it means burn-stone. Ruth Berman I was told by a Welshman (called Jones) that old Welsh surnames virtually disappeared after the first census (I don’t know when that was). He told me that most Welsh people were illiterate and the census details were mainly recorded by the English, who couldn’t spell the Welsh names, so they asked for the Christian name of the person’s father. If it was John, they recorded Jones, Evan became Evans and David became Davis. The names of the aristocracy would have survived, the obvious one being Llewellyn. carolburrows ",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Readers reply: why are Brown, White or Black common surnames but not Red, Blue or Purple?",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/17/readers-reply-why-are-brown-white-or-black-common-surnames-but-not-red-blue-or-purple
4/17/2022,"Sex and gender have come to represent one of the hottest fronts in the modern culture wars. Now, on to this bloody battlefield, calmly dodging banned books, anti-transgender laws and political doublespeak, strolls the distinguished Dutch-American primatologist Frans de Waal, brandishing nearly half a century’s worth of field notebooks and followed, metaphorically speaking, by an astonishingly diverse collection of primates. Given the world it enters, de Waal’s new book, Different: What Apes Can Teach Us About Gender, would arguably have failed if it didn’t stimulate debate. It seems safe from death by indifference, however, since it is dividing opinion even before it is published. “I found the book to be as wise as it was humane,” the American primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy told me, while US palaeontologist and writer Riley Black , a non-binary trans woman, is disappointed the author didn’t attempt a more radical overhaul of sex. Princeton University primatologist Agustín Fuentes, meanwhile, is full of admiration for de Waal’s descriptions of ape behaviour, but feels the book falls short when it comes to humans. Given the author’s public visibility and his masterful storytelling skills, Fuentes told me, this was his opportunity to present a thorough and thoughtful discussion of the latest research. “Unfortunately,” he said, “that’s not this book.” What this book is is an attempt to put the biology – the sex – back into gender. For too long, de Waal thinks, gender was regarded as a purely social construct and talk of inborn sex differences was taboo. “The fact that we have genders is related to the fact that we have sexes and sexual reproduction,” he told me, ahead of a tour to promote Different. “That’s an undeniable fact, in my opinion, even though the gender concept is obviously more flexible than the two sexes that we have.” Sex (male/female) is approximately binary, he argues, while gender (masculine/feminine) is a spectrum. The fact that the latter grew out of the former should not stop us questioning the cultural components of gender, some of which are based on a misunderstanding of biology, nor rejecting gender-based discrimination. Different doesn’t mean better or worse. He makes this case by reference to the non-human primates he has observed for decades, but the book is also a plea to us to look beyond chimpanzees when searching for parallels in our nearest primate relatives. We are just as close to bonobos, the “Kama Sutra apes” for whom sex is as banal as a handshake, though much more fun. It was only by accident, de Waal reminds us, that explorers stumbled on chimps first and they became our go-to model of primate behaviour (some Victorian prudishness helped). Since chimps are generally more aggressive than bonobos, this skewed emphasis gave rise to an unjustifiably bleak view of human nature, he feels, which has only begun to lighten up in the last few decades. In his unfashionable optimism about humanity, he compares himself to a frog he once spotted in an Australian lavatory bowl. Like the frog, he has clung on through periodic deluges of cynicism and despair. Among his accumulated titles, de Waal is professor of psychology at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and from the first pages of Different you know you’re in the presence of someone who feels beyond the slings and arrows of the culture wars. “You wouldn’t write a book like that if you were 40 and trying to get tenure,” remarks Meredith Small, an anthropologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and an admirer. He’s well-known enough to feel comfortable sharing personal reflections on growing up as one of six brothers and describing himself as a feminist who nevertheless refuses to denigrate his own gender. He’s also critical of what he sees as the contradictions of modern feminism, in particular, the idea that gender is socially constructed until it comes to gender identity and sexual orientation, which are innate and immutable. Primatology is a relatively young field that was founded by men but came to be dominated by women, which means it is acutely aware that who is looking is as important as what they see. This cisgender, straight, 73-year-old white man is no exception. He describes how the field broadened its horizons thanks to the feminisation that has happened over his career. “When the women came, we got more interested in female-female and mother-offspring relationships,” he told me. “Female choice became an important issue.” His entrancing descriptions of apes illustrate this. There’s Princess Mimi, the “bonobo with staff” who grew up pampered in a human home and was mystified by the retinue of males with obvious erections she acquired on meeting her own kind; the gender-nonconforming chimp Donna and the gay capuchin monkey Lonnie, both of whom were fully integrated into their respective colonies; Mama, the wise kingmaker among chimps; and the rhesus macaque love triangle of Orange, Dandy and Mr Spickles. Through these characters de Waal brings to life the complexity of sex and social behaviour in other apes. He recounts, for example, how Nikkie, a young and possibly overpromoted alpha-male chimp, was chased up a tree by a bunch of disgruntled underlings who wouldn’t let him come down. “After about a quarter of an hour, Mama slowly climbed into the tree. She touched Nikkie and kissed him. Then she climbed down while he followed close at heel. Now that Mama was bringing him with her, nobody resisted any more. Nikkie, obviously still nervous, made up with his adversaries. No other chimp in the group, male or female, could have brought about such a smooth closing.” Mr Spickles was the alpha male of a large macaque troop; Orange was the alpha female. The males all looked up to Mr Spickles, the females to Orange. But Mr Spickles enjoyed his privileged status largely thanks to Orange, his staunchest political ally. When mating season came around, Orange would pair up with Dandy, a handsome male almost half Mr Spickles’s age. If Mr Spickles tried to chase Dandy away, Orange would simply seek her younger mate out again. But if Dandy was tempted to flaunt his youth and vigour in front of Mr Spickles, Orange would loyally take up position next to the ageing alpha. “Orange carefully balanced two preferences,” de Waal writes. “One concerned political leadership and the other sexual desire. She never confused the two.” Both males and females strive – non-consciously – to maximise their evolutionary fitness, but because they differ biologically their methods for achieving this goal differ too. Protecting offspring from male infanticide is a common female preoccupation, de Waal says, which is why one rule holds across species: “The typical primate society is at heart a female kinship network run by older matriarchs.” Beyond that, however, there are as many models of relations between the sexes as there are species. Males and females are both hierarchical, but these hierarchies are based on more than just physical prowess or fighting ability. Prestige, which is less visible, counts too. Hierarchies are always at least partly coercive, but prestige always has a component of altruism and community-mindedness to it, as Mama and Orange showed. In most primates, the alpha female ranks below the alpha male. He has strength but she has choice. (Bonobos, uniquely, have reversed this order: females invest everything in the sisterhood, which collectively dominates the group.) As a result, the female has been underrated, an argument the British zoologist Lucy Cooke also made recently, in her acclaimed book Bitch. But de Waal thinks we’ve gone wrong at a deeper level. He challenges the idea that non-humans are “natural” while humans are “cultural”, arguing that nature and nurture are inextricably entwined in both. Apes may have gender as well as sex – there are hints of cultural variation in the way the sexes behave in non-human primates, though he says it hasn’t been studied enough yet – but you can’t take the sex out of human gender. In this domain as in so many others, de Waal says, we’re more similar to other primates than we think. (Years ago, he coined a term for those who warned against anthropomorphising other primates: “anthropodenialists”.) Yet humans do seem to be unique in one way. We are apparently the only ape that attaches labels to sexual or gender diversity and prejudices to the labels. In other primates, he says, “I don’t find the kind of intolerance we have in human societies”. He expects blowback from two broad camps – the feminists whom he overtly criticises in the book and those conservatives who claim that men are men and women are women and never the twain shall meet, wrongly asserting that science supports their position. But he also has critics closer to home. Black says he fails to ask the most fundamental question: what is biological sex? “Is it chromosomes or hormones or gametes, or some combination thereof, or is it a concept we need to go back and start over?” she asks. Until we’ve answered that question, she feels it’s unreasonable to assume that sex is essentially binary, even if de Waal does allow for some blurring and acknowledges non-binary and transgender people. Fuentes wonders why he overlooks a large body of research on human sex and gender – work by the American neuroscientist Lise Eliot, for example, showing that male and female brains aren’t that different, or British psychologist Cordelia Fine’s probing of the complex feedback loops that exist between sex and gender. To read these and other researchers, Fuentes says, is to understand that the non-human-natural/human-cultural division is a straw person argument. Moreover, in the introduction to Different, de Waal explains that he will not discuss areas of human behaviour for which there are no animal parallels, such as economic disparities, household labour and dress. “But you can’t discuss gender without these!” Fuentes says. These controversies will undoubtedly dominate discussion of the book once it comes out, so now seems a good moment to flag up some of de Waal’s quieter but still thought-provoking observations, such as: “Most beauty in nature exists thanks to female taste.” Or: “We have no evidence that any species other than our own knows that sex leads to progeny.” And whether or not you agree with him, Different is worth reading for its anecdotes alone. The description of two grizzled male chimps who were normally sworn enemies, arms slung around each other’s shoulders, forming a barrage between a newborn and a young alpha male with possibly infanticidal intent, is one of many that will be hard to forget.

4/17/2022,"Billie Eilish’s stratospheric rise from Soundcloud teen to topping one of the world’s biggest music events has been nothing short of astonishing – and no one seems more surprised tonight than the pop sensation herself. “This is so weird. I should not be headlining this shit,” she says Saturday night at Coachella, with goofy disbelief. “It’s been three years, man.” She’s right, her trajectory since she made her Coachella debut in 2019 has been breathlessly fast, already with two chart-topping albums, a Bond theme, seven Grammy awards and the hearts of pretty much every kid with TikTok on her endless list of achievements. Now another to add: at 20, this performance makes her the youngest festival headliner in Coachella history. But it’s these bashful confessions and say-what-you-feel relatability that has helped make her one of the world’s biggest stars. And she has the eviscerating show to match: part vampire rave, part Disney fantasy, which takes the audience to dizzying heights (and not just because she performs a bunch of songs in a cherry picker). Eilish is celebrated for her quiet/loud, whisper/bosh dynamics, and they are of widescreen levels here, in an emotional yo-yo that’s unnervingly banging one minute and surprisingly intimate the next. She opens with the all-drumming, all-strobing pop-punk of Happier Than Ever, dressed in a white graffitied shirt, shorts and kneepads, her hair in black bunches, like a missing member of Suicide Squad. The stage is dramatically stark, bathed in blood-red, with only brother Finneas and drummer Andrew Marshall on the riser behind her. A promenade jutting out into the audience gives Eilish a catwalk on which to strut or gambol along, occasionally breaking into a sensual wiggle, knowingly toying with perceptions of her as sexualized, or not (as she did when she glammed up in a corset for the cover of VOGUE last year). But no sooner has she writhed on the floor to the pouty electro pulse of My Strange Addiction, it’s into sweeping piano ballad Lovely, for which the singer Khalid joins her onstage. Similarly, the jittery industrial punisher You Should See Me In A Crown, which has people thrashing about like they’re in a Euphoria party scene, is followed by the mellow samba of Billie Bossa Nova. These shifts in tone might be jarring if it wasn’t for Eilish’s dynamite magnetism and exceptional voice. On her two albums, 2019’s When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? and 2021’s Happier Than Ever, the takeaways have often been her murmuring register – which, no doubt, has changed the sound of contemporary pop. And yet her voice can also cut glass, soaring in places like a Pixar movie, and never missing a note. It’s none more apparent than on her lambent Bon Iver-styled folkie, Your Power, which she performs front of stage on acoustic guitar with her brother, the architect of her sound, her airy falsetto practically sparkling. It’s her charm too that carries the most unexpected moment of her performance, when she brings onstage a man who, in a move that instantly ages anyone over the age of 30 by an extra two decades, she introduces as Damon Albarn from Gorillaz. Albarn – who not long ago dissed a similarly placed young pop titan, Taylor Swift – joins her to sing on Getting Older, as home video footage of her and Finneas as children patchworks the screens (perhaps why some fans on Twitter apparently mistook him for Eilish’s dad). He stays for the perky funk of Gorillaz’s Feel Good Inc, which gets the biggest bop of the evening. That’s unless you count the innumerable dancers that flank her for Oxytocin. Eilish’s show, having only just toured the States, has been noted for its minimalism, never detracting from the star, so it’s thrilling when, earlier in the set, the latex-wrapped army surrounds her and pogo like it might flag down an alien spaceship. There’s an interesting contrast between the spikiness of Eilish’s songs and how she speaks to her audience – often, as if she’s about to lead an ecstatic dance session. “I want us to be grateful that we’re alive,” she proclaims before When The Party’s Over (its celestial intro sounding here not unlike the start of Madonna’s Like A Prayer). Then she asks them to breathe deeply (which they probably would do if so many of them weren’t racing back to their cars). It might sound a touch contrived, but rather it underlines Eilish’s distinct lack of ego as a performer, as does the moment towards the end when she plonks a cowboy hat on her head and prances about to her definitive goth-pop anthem, Bad Guy. She’s here to play, slay and best of all, to stay.",Arts/Music,Billie Eilish at Coachella review – pop sensation delivers electrifying show,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/17/billie-eilish-coachella-review
4/17/2022,"Boris Johnson’s disgrace is only deepening. On Tuesday, the House of Commons will hear a new prime ministerial statement on so-called Partygate, trailed over the weekend as “a plea for perspective”. But from any reasonable standpoint, he will surely look shamed and desperate. Johnson reportedly faces more fines for breaking his own lockdown laws – and, by implication, further proof of his lies. May’s local elections, and now a byelection in red wall Wakefield, draw closer. And as he doggedly hangs on to power, the vacuum at the heart of his government is now impossible to ignore. Long spells in power tend to leave parties short on ideas and devoid of any sense of purpose. But thanks partly to the prime minister’s entirely self-centred understanding of politics, this government’s sense of moral and political rot is something else again. A question now screams out for an answer that no one seems able to provide: six years on from the 2016 referendum and nearly three years into Johnson’s time at the top, what is left of British Conservatism? Tory ideas and attitudes that once defined the party have been discarded, or drastically weakened. The old strand of centre-right, “one nation” politics that really was conservative – sceptical, nonideological and usually opposed to any radical change – still exists, but is a marginal presence, first sidelined by Thatcherism, then dealt another blow by the Conservative party’s furious embrace of Brexit. The free-market credo Thatcher used to reinvent her party still has plenty of high-profile disciples (Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak among them), but it now feels more like a nostalgic comfort blanket than a vibrant set of ideas – seriously weakened not just by its lack of answers to 21st-century problems, but by Johnson’s professed belief in economic interventionism, and the way the pandemic has shredded no end of Tory shibboleths, not least their belief in low taxation. Amid the “war on woke” and the rank nastiness of Priti Patel’s Home Office, David Cameron and George Osborne’s brief attempt to “modernise” their party and acquaint it with liberal social attitudes seems like ancient history. Meanwhile, many of the supposed big new ideas brought to post-Brexit Conservatism seem to have already withered away, as evidenced by the great anticlimax of “levelling up”: a bit of spending here and there, but nowhere near the great economic reformation voters were promised. To cap it all, Johnson’s conduct – or, more to the point, his party’s acceptance of it – now threatens even its most basic articles of faith. If they wave through law-breaking and lying to parliament, how can Conservatives still claim to believe in law and order and the sanctity of British institutions? As the damage caused by Brexit piles up, the idea that the Conservatives are the party of business is also fading fast. For the foreseeable future, there ought to be plenty of room in British politics for a party of the centre-right comfortable with modernity, and attached to property ownership, limited government, a cautious approach to social change and the promise – however illusory – that the benefits of capitalism are open to everyone. But the Tories seem to be going much the way of the US Republican party, transformed over 30 or 40 years from politically stable protectors of the status quo into a volatile mess of almost neurotic obsessions and animosities, and currently just about stilled by a collective belief in one all-powerful individual. Despite their sense of political decay, a mixture of factors – age, demographics, Brexit, our creaking electoral system and the failures of the Labour party – has kept the Tories in power. But many of these things will not last. The relevant numbers are stark: almost half of Tory voters are now over 65, and 83% are over 45. For younger people, the economic model created by Thatcher and her heirs has entailed the impossibility of home ownership, and there is fading interest in what the Tories have to offer, surely accelerated by Brexity nostalgia and nastiness: in 1983, the Conservatives won the support of 42% of those aged 18 to 24, but by 2019, that figure had halved. Given that degree-level education now seems to tilt people away from the Tories, the fact that 50% of young people in England now go to university is a big driver of that shift. It is also worth noting deep changes in the culture and politics of many places that once gave the Tories their most loyal support: as highlighted by the party’s declining fortunes in everywhere from suburban Greater Manchester to the south-east commuter belt, an increasingly large chunk of the English middle class is now socially liberal, eco-minded and repulsed by the Tories’ increasingly reactionary instincts. Somewhere in their collective soul, a lot of Conservatives presumably know that their current political luck will soon run out, but that nagging realisation only makes some of them more determined to upturn as many things as they can, while they still have the chance. The result is that paranoid, flailing style of politics that Johnson has decided is his best means of staying on top. Any distinction between substantial policy and desperate gimmicks has long since dissolved. The prime minister and his allies seem to have precious little to say about the everyday realities of people’s lives. Everything centres on his apparently amoral attitude to power and a growing array of enemies: judges, “leftwing lawyers”, broadcasters, teachers. The abiding impression is of people with a rabid disdain not just for the conventions of politics and power, but for liberal democracy itself. In 2020, the British political writer Edmund Fawcett published a compelling work of history titled Conservatism: The Fight for a Tradition, whose story runs from the 19th century to the present day. “To survive, let alone flourish, liberal democracy needs the right’s support,” he wrote. “It needs, that is, conservatives who accept liberal and democratic ground rules … When, as now, the right hesitates or denies its support, liberal democracy’s health is at risk.” He added: “With the left in retreat, both intellectually and in party terms, the right commands politics at present. But which right is that? Is it the broadly liberal conservatism that underpinned liberal democracy’s post-1945 successes or an illiberal hard right claiming to speak for ‘the people’?” When I reread those words last week, the home secretary was in Rwanda, announcing a policy on refugees seemingly inspired by a work of dystopian fiction, while the prime minister continued to think he ought to be allowed get away with breaking the law and then endlessly lying about it. Once again, it was obvious which side they had picked. For any Conservatives who remain genuinely conservative, that ought to be an urgent reason to get rid of their leader and at least attempt to reconnect their party with coherence, sense and the basic responsibilities that come with power. Maybe the rot is now too deep; perhaps expecting any moral course of action from a political force so used to shamelessness and cruelty is a vain hope. But if only to pull our system of government back from a complete moral void, if consciences once again stir and a few Tories start to move, the rest of us ought to quietly cheer them on.
