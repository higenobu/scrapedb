1/21/2022,"For the first time in weeks, Big Dog had had an uninterrupted night’s sleep. The previous day had gone better than expected, with Christian Wakeford’s defection to Labour having shocked most of his rebellious MPs back into displays – ersatz or not – of public affection for him. Boris Johnson was now daring to believe he might be able to ride out the party scandals and Sue Gray and the Tory party would fail to notice, or just not care, that he had consistently lied about what he had done at every opportunity. Perhaps his luck had finally changed. Or perhaps not. The prime minister’s first jolt with reality came when the baby-faced assassin, William Wragg, who had already called for him to resign, opened proceedings of the public administration and constitutional affairs select committee of which he was chair. He wanted to make a statement, he said. It had been brought to his attention that a number of MPs believed to be unhappy with Johnson’s leadership had reportedly been intimidated by government whips and threatened – in a direct breach of the ministerial code – with having public money withdrawn from investments in their constituencies.  Furthermore, these MPs had also allegedly been leant on with blackmail threats. If they didn’t fall in line, then the government would whisper in the ear of tame newspapers to plant hostile stories – who cared if they were true? – in the press. Having finished his opening remarks, Wragg turned to his two witnesses, Steve Barclay, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and minister for the Cabinet Office, and Alex Chisholm, chief operating officer of the civil service and permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office. Would they take this back to both the government and the civil service respectively? Both yawned, struggling to contain their uninterest, and said “whatever”. Both Barclay and Chisholm seemed to have come to the committee with the sole intention of being as monosyllabic and as obstructive as possible. Why had it not been possible to get Sue Gray to appear before the committee to give evidence on the Greensill lobbying scandal? Barclay replied that it had been his predecessor, Michael Gove, who had blocked the committee on that occasion. So would it now be possible to get her to appear? “To talk about Greensill?” asked Barclay. Yes, Wragg said. Hmm. The sloth-like Barclay slowly eased himself higher in his chair. Actually, he didn’t think that was a good idea because some members of the committee might use the occasion to ask her about her soon-to-be-published report on the prime minister’s parties. Not that they were parties, of course. Heaven forbid. What he could promise, though, was that he would come along to answer any questions they had for Gray. But you don’t know anything, observed Tory David Jones. Barclay nodded eagerly. That was precisely why he was the right man to come back and appear before the committee. Barclay: the unthinking man’s time-waster. Chisholm was no more helpful when asked about the Lord Geidt inquiry into Big Dog’s hideous wallpaper. How was it that Geidt had only found out about the “forgotten” messages through the press? Chisholm had no idea. It had been appalling that Geidt had found out about it at all. He would do his best to make sure that nothing was leaked to the media in future so there was no way Geidt could accidentally stumble on the truth. And what about the behaviour of No 10 staff and civil servants? Chisholm preened. He could assure the committee that Geidt had been extended the utmost respect and courtesy as everyone tried to hinder him from doing his job. Outside the committee, it wasn’t long before the Big Dog Ultras were piling in on Wragg’s opening statement about intimidation and blackmail. Tory MP Pauline Latham insisted it had never happened to her. There again, she has never shown any sign of independent thought, so why should it? Michael Fabricant, the idiot’s idiot, was less helpful than intended by tweeting that the whips had threatened him with all sorts of things in the past and it was no big deal. Nice one, Mickey Fab. Meanwhile Boris refusenik Andrew Bridgen said that the Times had printed an untrue story about him earlier in the week while Wakeford revealed that the whips had threatened not to go ahead with building a new school in his constituency. This new corruption allegation wasn’t about to go away any time soon. Down in Taunton, on yet another visit to a hospital – Big Dog must have the prime ministerial version of Munchausen by proxy as he makes everything with which he comes in contact infinitely worse – Boris was having nightmares of his own. First he had had to listen to Sajid Javid come unstuck on the morning media round. The health secretary had first said that it was a complete coincidence that Covid was now over on the day the government needed good news, only to contradict himself and say it wasn’t over. Then he had got into metaphysics. Could a party be said to have happened if no one could remember having been to it? Then he had said that everyone still trusted Big Dog. The questions they had for him were what killer combination of drugs he had taken that had rendered him both completely comatose and wiped his memory to such an extent he couldn’t even remember what the rules he had put in place were. These were also questions he was asked by ITV’s Anushka Asthana in a pooled television interview. Sue Gray, he replied. Hopefully she would be able to tell him what he had been doing because he was buggered if he knew. Could we now talk about cancer diagnostics? We couldn’t, as Asthana pressed him on the Wragg allegations. He definitely couldn’t remember seeing or hearing of anything like that, he said. Then, his memory was totally shot these days anyway. So perhaps it had happened. He had no idea, With that he scuttled off, desperate not to prolong his pain as he had with Beth Rigby earlier in the week. More long nights of the soul loomed ahead. Or at least intensive searches to find out whether he had one.",News/Politics,Baby-faced assassin has Boris Johnson in his sights | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/20/baby-faced-assassin-has-boris-johnson-in-his-sights
1/21/2022,"Emma Raducanu said that she was proud of the fight she demonstrated in her second-round match at the Australian Open on Thursday after she was defeated by Montenegro’s Danka Kovinic in three tight sets despite suffering badly from blisters. On a day of disappointment for Britain at Melbourne Park, Andy Murray bowed out with a straight sets defeat to the qualifier Taro Daniel shortly before Raducanu was eliminated. Due to her injury the 19-year-old was forced to spend much of the match slicing her forehand, which she says unlocked a new part of her game and underlined her fighting spirit after winning the US Open last year.  “I did discover elements of my game I didn’t know I had before, and I can use that going forward,” said Raducanu. “And also I just know that I’ve got that fight in me. Even if I have, like, one shot, I know that I can pull myself out of deep situations. Because I’m still young, I feel like I can learn a backhand, I can learn some tactics, but it’s quite hard to learn or teach someone that fight and grittiness to hang in there when things are pretty much all against you. So I’m quite proud of that.” Raducanu had reached the second round by defeating the former US Open champion Sloane Stephens before she fell 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 to Kovinic. She admitted that she has been struggling with blisters since returning to training after missing a few weeks due to Covid. Raducanu revealed that members in her team did not even want her to compete in Australia but she fought to be there. “That thought when I was slicing forehands and really struggling, I was, like, ‘do I [retire]?’ But I didn’t want to – as I said, some people in my team didn’t want me to even go out there. So I fought so hard just to come out to Australia and play here, and I didn’t want to go out like that. So I just left it all out on the court after everything I went through.” Shortly before Raducanu’s exit, Murray’s return to the Australian Open ended in a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 defeat to Japan’s Daniel, who is ranked 120th in the world. Murray said that he wanted to come back to the tournament in 2023 but it is contingent on how well he performs this year. “Yeah,” said Murray when asked if he was planning to return next year. “But not if I do what I did tonight too often this season. This is a really important year for me for a number of reasons, and I want to perform well in the big events. For me, tonight is not good enough in that respect.” He added: “Making the second round of slams is not something I find particularly motivating. I want to be doing better than that. [It] depends on how I get on this year results-wise and how I perform in the big events.” Two days after defeating Nikoloz Basilashvili, the 21st seed, over five gruelling sets, Murray said he was not in any physical pain but his disappointment was clear. “It depends on many things,” said Murray of his future in the game. “But obviously a performance like tonight is not something I find motivating at this stage. I’m not sure I’ve lost a match to someone ranked outside [the Top] 100 before in a slam. I don’t know. I don’t think I have. So from that respect it’s not a great loss for me.”",Sport/Sport,Raducanu ‘proud’ despite defeat while Murray admits loss ‘not good enough’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/emma-raducanu-andy-murray-australian-open-tennis
1/21/2022,"Britain’s biggest housebuilding companies have told the government they must not be the only ones to pay the potential £4bn cost of fixing fire safety problems in apartment blocks. At a crunch meeting with Michael Gove on Thursday, they said the government and companies that sold combustible materials must shoulder some of the blame.  The summit between senior executives from 20 building firms and the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities was described as producing “constructive dialogue” but failing to make significant progress on resolving the building safety crisis affecting tens of thousands of leaseholders. Gove is understood to have made clear his resolve that leaseholders should not pay, that “those with the broadest shoulders must pay”, and that the negotiations must be resolved “at speed”. Attendees included executives from Barratt Homes, Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon, the Berkeley Group and Bellway. One source said there was frustration on the housebuilders’ side that the government did not have a firm grasp of the size of the bill to be divided up. Last week the government said there was £4bn in outstanding costs but developers believe that is an overestimate and both sides agreed to delve deeper into the cost. Such negotiations are likely to frustrate leaseholders urgently seeking an end to their plight. “These firms have all got shareholders,” the source said. “They are not going to come out and say: ‘Here’s £4bn’.” The meeting was held after Gove told parliament he was “coming for” developers and that “those who manufactured dangerous products and developed dangerous buildings have shown insufficient contrition”. Gove and officials said developers who did not cooperate could be hit by restrictions through the planning system, supply of public land and taxation. During the meeting an official highlighted how one of the developers in attendance had drawn £40m from the public building safety fund to fix combustible cladding but had contributed nothing yet from its own profits. Gove said that by March he hoped to have obtained funding promises from the developers to fix hundreds of thousands of homes found to have fire safety defects since the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017. He said he expected those responsible for affected buildings with annual profits from housebuilding of at least £10m to pay for all remediation of fire safety defects in buildings between 11 metres and 18 metres high. The government has already earmarked more than £5bn of public money for repairs to combustible cladding on buildings over 18 metres. The major housebuilders said they believed it was “not equitable” if only they were taxed more heavily. They suggested that because the government set the building regulations under which all the works were carried out, it must bear some responsibility. That argument may gain strength when former government ministers face questions at the Grenfell Tower public inquiry starting next month over their role in promoting a “bonfire of red tape”, which included failing to tighten up fire regulations after the fatal Lakanal House fire in south London in 2009. Stuart Baseley, the executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation, said the industry lobby group had made its position clear at the meeting and would continue to engage constructively with the government. “We absolutely agree that leaseholders should not have to pay to remediate buildings. However we firmly believe that any further solutions must be proportionate.” He said the bill should be shared with “other companies, sectors and organisations”, including “freeholders and the materials providers who designed, tested and sold materials that developers purchased in good faith”. “As we made clear to the government, we do not believe it should fall to responsible UK housebuilders to fund the remediation of buildings built by foreign companies, developers no longer trading, or other parties.” A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said Gove “set out the government’s expectations for industry to cover the costs of fixing unsafe buildings and he reiterated that nothing was off the table. [The] roundtable was attended by senior executives from the country’s biggest developers, and these representatives agreed leaseholders should not pay. We continue to engage with them to ensure they deliver a fully funded action plan by early March.”",News/Society,Developers tell Gove: we will not foot £4bn fire safety bill alone,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/20/developers-tell-gove-we-will-not-foot-4bn-fire-safety-bill-alone
1/21/2022,"It could be a slow return to business across the UK as chilly weather and ongoing fears about the spread of Omicron keep many workers, shoppers and diners at home, despite the change in guidance. The many workplaces who have told staff to work from home until a review in late January are also unlikely to make a swift change in plan.  The London underground network recorded 8% more journeys on Thursday compared with a week earlier. Transport for London said 1.09m entry and exit “taps” with contactless cards or Oyster were recorded up to 10am on Thursday on the tube – about 80,000 more than last Thursday’s morning peak. Bus journeys were up 3% week on week, with 1.19m boarding taps recorded during Thursday morning. The changed guidance appeared to have made no discernible difference to road traffic, with morning peak congestion slightly lower on Thursday than Wednesday in London, Manchester and the West Midlands urban region, according to data from satnav firm TomTom. Gwyn Topham Retailers are hopeful that a return to offices will help city centre stores but unsure how the revival of leisure and entertainment attractions, as well as the cost-of-living squeeze, will affect spending on non-essential goods. The number of visitors to UK city centres outside the capital was up nearly 2% on Thursday compared with the same day a week before and almost 4% higher in London. Across all destinations, numbers were virtually flat week-on-week and down by a fifth on pre-pandemic levels according to data provider Springboard – a similar pattern to recent months. Cafe chain Pret a Manger’s sales at London stations were at only 71% of pre-Covid levels last week. Its sales in the suburbs, in contrast were 15% up on 2019. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium trade body, said: “Consumers had limited options on how to spend their money in 2021 and will soon find themselves with more choice and less to spend.” John Bason, the finance director of Primark owner Associated British Foods, said it was unlikely Primark’s city centre stores would go back to pre-Covid levels but he did expect better times ahead. “We are confident [city centres] will improve now we are coming out of Omicron and some of the restrictions. We have got to see an increase in the number of tourists. It will feel a lot better in the summer,” he said. Sarah Butler Pub and restaurant bosses say there are early indications of a release in pent-up demand from December, when many people stayed at home to ensure they could still enjoy Christmas. Revolution Bars, which has 67 UK venues, said corporate parties cancelled in December were “pleasingly” being rebooked for early 2022. Chris Jowsey, chief executive of 1,000-strong pub chain Admiral Taverns, said weekend trading had been decent. A third of consumers are planning more hospitality visits after January, according to survey by data analysts CGA. Rob Davies For bankers, a return to the office – or not – very much depends on your employer and your role. Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon was among the most outspoken big business advocates of returning to offices when possible and the US investment bank’s staff have been asked to return. HSBC said it was making arrangements for colleagues to return to UK offices as part of their hybrid working arrangements from Thursday. Santander UK will update its office-based workers in the coming days, but it will also drop the requirement for customers to wear a mask in branches after 27 February. JP Morgan is thought to be likely to revert to pre-plan B measures, where teams decided their own working patterns, but everyone had to be in the office for at least some of the week. During the Plan B restrictions the bank had as little as 15% of staff in English offices, compared with more than half before the Omicron wave. Traders, whose roles are tightly regulated, were thought to be among the workers most likely to have remained in offices during the plan B measures, often for as much as five days a week. Jasper Jolly Companies providing flexible office space said they were already seeing a rise in demand as businesses and their staff returned to offices in greater numbers and adopted hybrid working patterns. “Following the lifting of work from home guidelines in July 2021 we saw an uptake in deals with new and existing customers as well as an increase in footfall across our locations in the UK,” said Mark Dixon, founder and CEO of IWG. “We are expecting to see similar business momentum this time around with particularly strong demand for our suburban and rural locations.” Rival company Workspace said the decision to ditch plan B restrictions would further boost business confidence at a time when its customers were already returning to the office. Mark Sweney Gyms are hopeful of an increase in membership as working from home guidance is removed and fitness fans feel more confident about returning to using indoor equipment. On Thursday, The Gym Group, which has about 200 outlets, said visits per member had returned to pre-Covid levels in January and membership had increased 8% from December. Richard Darwin, the chief executive of The Gym Group, said: “We have been encouraged to see good levels of gym usage and new member acquisition so far this year.” Sarah Butler",News/World news,UK’s business sectors edge out of plan B Covid ways – slowly,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/uk-business-sectors-end-plan-b-covid
1/21/2022,"Joe Biden on Thursday marked a year since his inauguration as president obliged to confront the same urgent crises he inherited when he took the oath of office: an unrelenting pandemic, economic uncertainty and a democracy threatened by partisan division and lies.  But now those challenges have been compounded by a string of setbacks, both at home and abroad, that have eroded confidence in his leadership. In his first public appearance of the day, 12 months on from the one where he swept Donald Trump out of the White House, Biden was in a position of having to clarify loose remarks he made the day before about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. During a marathon press conference on Wednesday afternoon to mark the anniversary of his presidency, Biden alarmed Kyiv by appearing to suggest that allies were divided over how to respond should a move by Moscow be a “minor incursion”. On Thursday, speaking at the White House, he said “any” Russian movement across the Ukrainian border would be met with a “severe and coordinated economic response” from Nato. He also vowed a response should Russia “use measures other than overt military actions”, such as “paramilitary tactics” and other methods of warfare. Warning the Russian president, Biden said: “Let there be no doubt at all: if Putin makes this choice, Russia will pay a heavy price.” Biden’s clarification came after the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted in English and Ukrainian: “We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones.” Biden made the initial remarks at a Wednesday press conference, during which he also mounted a nearly two-hour defense of his first year in office. He insisted that the administration had handled the coronavirus “remarkably well,” noting that tens of millions of Americans had been fully vaccinated. On the economy, he touted record low unemployment, and outlined his plans for taming inflation and alleviating supply chain bottlenecks. Defiant, Biden vowed to pursue a scaled-back version of his signature domestic policy bill, stalled before the Senate amid opposition from members of his own party. He was realistic about the prospects of passing voting rights legislation to counter the barrage of new restrictions enacted by Republican-controlled state legislatures across the country. “It’s going to be difficult. I make no bones about that,” he said, hours before Republicans blocked Democrats’ latest attempt to pass the bills, which the president described as critical to the fate of American democracy. The vote – and Democrats’ failure to unite around a plan to change the rules to pass the bills – illustrated the difficulty he faces delivering on his campaign promises, despite Democratic control of Congress. Underscoring the depth of Biden’s challenges, he wrapped the first year of his presidency with one of the lowest approval ratings of any of his recent predecessors. A new poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research on Thursday found that, for the first time, a majority of Americans now disapprove of his handling of the presidency. According to the poll, 56% of Americans disapprove of the way Biden is handling his job as president, compared to 43% who approve. A dismal 28% of Americans say they want Biden to run for re-election in 2024, including only 48% of Democrats, it found. The figures represent a sharp decline for Biden, who began his presidency with relatively strong support from a public hopeful that he would bring a sense of normalcy after four tumultuous years of Donald Trump. His political fortunes have since declined, with his approval ratings falling sharply in September after the chaotic and rushed military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the arrival of the Delta variant that caused coronavirus infections to spike. Asked about his sagging approval ratings, Biden replied: “I don’t believe the polls.” Accepting that his approach needed to change, Biden said he planned to spend less time locked in private negotiations and more time on the road making the case for his policies to Americans as Democrats fight to retain control of Congress in the November midterm elections. “The public doesn’t want me to be the president-senator,” said Biden, who spent decades in the chamber as a senator from Delaware. “They want me to be the president, and let senators be senators.” Thursday also marks one year since Trump quietly left Washington for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where, far from fading into exile, he has spent the past year plotting a political comeback. Out of office – and banned from mainstream social media platforms – the twice-impeached former president has only tightened his grip on the Republican party. His base remains deeply loyal, convinced that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and eager to see him return to power in 2024. During his press conference, Biden accused Republicans of obstructing his agenda out of a devotion to his predecessor. “Did you ever think that one man out of office could intimidate an entire party?” Biden acknowledged that the pandemic, now in its third year, had left Americans demoralized and asked for their patience during the next year of his presidency. “Some people may call what’s happening now the new normal,” he said. “I call it a job not yet finished. It will get better.”",News/US news,Setbacks for Biden at home and abroad as he marks challenging year in office,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/20/biden-russia-ukraine-presidency-anniversary
1/21/2022,"Ivory Coast thumped Algeria 3-1 to send the defending champions crashing out of the Africa Cup of Nations finals on Thursday following a disastrous Group E campaign. Nicolas Pépé’s fine solo goal early in the second half put the game out of sight, the Arsenal winger advancing into the penalty area and curling the ball into the far corner. The Elephants led 2-0 at half-time thanks to Franck Kessié’s opener and an Ibrahim Sangaré header from Serge Aurier’s free-kick.  Algeria needed a win to escape the group after drawing with Sierra Leone and losing to Equatorial Guinea in their previous match, but they were outplayed in Douala. Djamel Belmadi’s side were awarded a soft-looking penalty at 3-0 down but Riyad Mahrez hit the post with his spot-kick.. Sofiane Bendebka pulled one goal back for Algeria, but Ivory Coast thought they had a fourth in stoppage time, only for Sébastien Haller’s strike to be disallowed by the VAR for offside. Patrice Beaumelle’s side go through as group winners, and will face Egypt in the last 16 next Wednesday. Equatorial Guinea finished second in Group E after a 1-0 victory over Sierra Leone in Limbe. Pierre Ganet scored what proved to be the winner in the 38th minute, slotting the ball home from José Machín’s quickly taken free-kick – but goalkeeper Jesús Owono was the National Thunder’s second-half hero. With Algeria behind in their game, Sierra Leone needed a draw to sneak into the last 16 as one of the four best third-placed sides. Their chance came when they won a penalty with five minutes to play. Kei Kamara stepped up, but saw his spot-kick saved by Owono – allowing Comoros to progress in their place. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has allayed fears over his health by insisting his heart is “absolutely fine” after he had to return prematurely from the Africa Cup of Nations. The Arsenal forward has not played for his club since the start of December due to a disciplinary breach which saw him stripped of the club captaincy. Aubameyang tested positive for Covid-19 on his arrival in Cameroon, and was sent home following “cardiac lesions” being reported by Gabon and CAF medical staff. In a post on Instagram, the 32-year-old wrote: “I came back to London to do some additional checks, and I’m very happy to say that my heart is absolutely fine and I’m completely healthy!!

1/21/2022,"The chief executive of the UK’s largest cat protection charity has stepped down after a row over the welfare of 18 cats being kept in his colleague’s three-bedroom house. Concerned about cat welfare and the charity’s reputation, Charles Darley, 59, said Cats Protection should not support the chair of trustees, Linda Upson, in keeping the pets on welfare grounds.  “To have a chair that apparently isn’t adhering to best practice is very damaging to the charity, and disastrous for staff morale,” Darley told the Guardian. “Defra guidelines say cats should be given sufficient space to hide from other cats and from people. Every cat should have its own food bowl, its own water bowl, its own scratching post … to think you can get 18 of those in one house would be stretching credibility.” He added: “I’ve spoken to five other charity chief executives, and they also said they couldn’t defend this number of cats in that house.” Upson, a GP practice manager, lives in Essex with a “large family of cats, all of whom have been adopted from Cats Protection”, according to the charity’s website. Darley ordered the board to investigate whether Upson was breaching the Animal Welfare Act, which says cats must be able “to exhibit normal behaviour patterns and be housed with, or apart from, other animals”. He suggested a behavioural scientist should inspect her home to identify signs of stress in her pets. He said the case was only partially investigated by a subcommittee led by the Cats Protection vice-chair, Angela Swarbrick, and that they instead sought promises that Upson would not take in any more cats. “The most senior trustees must set the right example … No leader deserves to be followed if they are advocating one set of standards and living by another,” Darley wrote on social media. Upson has been approached for comment. Darley, who joined Cats Protection in October, said trustees were not properly briefed on animal welfare guidelines. He said two audit firms shared his view that the charity should have a code of conduct for trustees and an animal welfare audit of cat fosterers, which he said the “board has blocked for several years”. “I have never in my career, working for 14 different charities, found trustees unwilling to sign up to a code of conduct,” Darley said. After failing to get the company’s backing for a new code of conduct, including welfare standards, he concluded he could not change the culture and stepped down. “My view is that if trustees’ duties in supporting the charity’s objectives ever conflict with their own private position, they should always put the charity first,” he said. Upson, who joined the company as a regional coordinator 30 years ago, wrote in a company report: “The Covid-19 pandemic has shown that our feline friends are more important to us than ever, providing much-needed company and light relief in a time of great anxiety. “Thanks to our wonderful supporters, volunteers and employees we can continue to be there for them too, ensuring that thousands of cats and kittens have a better life now and in the years ahead.” The group’s 10,000 volunteers and 1,000 employees help care for about 126,000 cats and kittens, and the charity receives £75m in donations each year. Darley said his predecessor, James Yeates, had also unsuccessfully raised the need for a code of conduct. A Cats Protection spokesperson said: “Cats Protection’s top priorities are the welfare of all cats, and the wellbeing of our 11,000 volunteers and staff, who work tirelessly to help cats in need. “In the case of our chair of trustees, herself a volunteer fosterer, we found the six foster cats in her care were kept in a separate, clean and well-kept area of her house, away from her pet cats. All were happy, healthy and had sufficient resources for them to express their natural behaviour, such as separate food and water bowls, scratching posts, hiding places and so on. Such conditions are in line with Cats Protection’s guidance and therefore there are no welfare issues of concern.​”​",News/World news,Cat charity CEO quits over colleague keeping 18 cats in house,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/20/cats-protection-ceo-steps-down-after-trustee-found-to-keep-18-cats
1/21/2022,"No one is under the illusion that the ending of Covid restrictions in England from next week is driven by science. The prime minister’s announcement on Wednesday was prompted by political desperation, not data. The daily death rate on Wednesday was reported as 359. Scientists warn that infections are likely to resurge. While the level of infection across the population and health staff absences are falling sharply, the chair of the British Medical Association warned that hospitalisations are double the level that they were when plan B was introduced, and case rates close to twice as high. Dr Chaand Nagpaul noted that the NHS remains under crippling pressure, with a record backlog of six million patients.  After two years of the pandemic, it is not only Tory backbenchers who long for a return to normality. It is true that Omicron has wreaked less damage than feared – though many have still lost loved ones, or suffered serious and perhaps lasting damage to their health. With vaccines and treatments now available, it is entirely reasonable that people are rethinking what constitutes appropriate and proportionate responses to the virus. Restrictions have saved countless lives, but they have economic, social and indeed health costs: the effects of isolation have been punishing for many. Yet Boris Johnson’s rush for the exit risks prolonging this wave – making life less normal, not more, with further disruption to education, healthcare and other services. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have chosen somewhat more cautious relaxations. Critically, they are keeping the mask mandate on public transport, in shops and similar places, while England is dropping it. There is further concern about Mr Johnson’s statement that the requirement to self-isolate will end when the legislation lapses on 24 March, if not earlier (Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has since struck a more cautious note), and reported plans to ditch free lateral flow tests from the end of June, although Mr Johnson has said that they will be free for as long as needed. One problem is that the government is still underestimating the true costs of the virus by failing to acknowledge the extent and often severity of long Covid. In December, the Office for National Statistics estimated that more than half a million people had symptoms that persisted for at least one year after catching Covid. In many cases these have been debilitating. Another is that the country is once again abandoning the clinically extremely vulnerable, and others who are at higher risk. These changes will make them less free, not more. While most of us endured a few months of lockdown, many of them have effectively been confined to their homes or significantly restricted in their movements. Research in November showed that a significant number had continued to shield. Some cannot be protected by vaccines. Others have not yet had the chance; the vaccination of at-risk under-12s is only starting this month. The prime minister’s recklessness and self-interest have already cost the nation dearly. Though he now, absurdly, claims to have made the right calls “on the big issues” in this pandemic, the biggest issue of all is surely the UK’s Covid death toll: at more than 150,000, it is one of the highest rates per capita in western Europe. His political calculations are now more naked than ever. A more responsible course of action would minimise the risks to the vulnerable by reducing infections through mandatory masking, ensuring testing is available to all and introducing proper sick pay. It is easy to say that we must learn to live with Covid.

1/21/2022,"This spring’s elections are getting an unusual amount of advance publicity. The cause, regrettably, is not a great revival of enthusiasm for local government. It is that the results may decide if Boris Johnson stays as prime minister – if he has not already gone by then. But the contests are important for other reasons. Nowhere is this more true than in Northern Ireland, where the assembly is up for election on 5 May. Since 1998, though with significant interruptions, Northern Ireland has been self-governing through power-sharing institutions agreed in the Good Friday agreement. The Northern Ireland executive has always been jointly led by the leaders of the largest parties in the assembly from the main rival traditions, unionist and nationalist, although there is now a growing non-sectarian tradition too.  It is increasingly possible, for the first time in 24 years, that a unionist party will not be the largest in the assembly this time. Instead, Sinn Féin is ahead in the polls. This reflects many things, including unionist divisions over the Brexit deal, infighting within the largest party the DUP, and nationalist dislike of Mr Johnson. But, if all this is confirmed in May, Sinn Féin will be entitled to nominate the new first minister. That outcome threatens a sectarian stand-off which Mr Johnson, if he is still in office, would be singularly badly equipped to resolve. This forms the backdrop to a government U-turn at Westminster this week that was overshadowed by the leadership crisis. Yet the U-turn was significant. Last week, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, proposed an amendment which would mean that, in place of the current ban, a Westminster MP would also be eligible to sit in the Northern Ireland assembly until the next general election. What this meant in practice was that things had been fixed so that Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, could sit in the assembly without causing a Westminster byelection in his Lagan Valley constituency. Mr Lewis’s plan caused outrage – some genuine, some confected – among Northern Ireland’s other parties, which had not been consulted about or consented to the change. In a political system dependent on compromise, and in which the UK government is a guarantor of fairness between the traditions, it was a stupid move. On Wednesday, with enough other crises on his plate already, Mr Johnson announced that the plan would be pulled. Dual mandates, as they were once termed, used to have a place in UK politics. It was possible to sit both at Westminster and in a devolved parliament, and indeed in the European one too. In some cases it still is. Arguably this helped to bind the legislatures and the country together in some useful ways. Arguably it still could. But double-jobbing, as it is now dubbed, is very unpopular, especially since the MPs’ expenses scandal caused public trust in politicians to collapse. The issue deserves more thought than it gets. But the partisan and piecemeal path chosen by Mr Lewis – glumly characteristic of the political manipulation that is too often the default option of this government – does absolutely nothing for it.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on dual mandates: double trouble in Northern Ireland | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/20/the-guardian-view-on-dual-mandates-double-trouble-in-northern-ireland
