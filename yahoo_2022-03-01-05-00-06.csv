3/1/2022,"By Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The United States still hasn't seen any ""muscle movements"" following Russian President Vladimir Putin's weekend announcement that he was putting his nuclear forces on high alert, a senior U.S. defense official said on Monday. But some former U.S. officials and experts caution that it would be a mistake to write off Putin's remarks as bluster, given the risk that Putin could decide to escalate to using nuclear weapons if he feels cornered over the war in Ukraine or if the war spills over into NATO. Russia's defense ministry on Monday said its nuclear missile forces and Northern and Pacific fleets had been placed on 'enhanced' combat duty, in line with an order the previous day from Putin. The phrase special, or enhanced, combat duty appears to have stumped the Pentagon. ""It's not a term of art in what we understand to be Russian (nuclear) doctrine,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""So that's why we're analyzing it and reviewing it to try to understand what exactly it means."" Leaders of the U.S. military, which built much of its intelligence collection architecture to spy on the Soviet Union, weren't aware of Putin's decision until he made it publicly and, so far, there have not been big movements of weapons or forces to demonstrate what it means, the U.S. official said. ""I don't believe we've seen anything specific as a result of the direction that he gave, at least not yet, in terms of appreciable or noticeable muscle movements,"" the official said. The United States closely monitors everything from Russian nuclear storage facilities to deployments of nuclear-capable bombers, missile forces and submarines. The White House said it saw ""no reason to change"" its nuclear alert levels at this time. The United States and Russia account for more than 90% of the world's nuclear weapons but only a fraction of them are deployed, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation,"" has failed to achieve any obvious objectives five days after launching its invasion, with no cities under Russian control, no Russian dominance of airspace, and some Russian troops running out of fuel and supplies. Putin is also confronting a wave of unprecedented economic and diplomatic isolation from the West, which is channeling hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine's military to fight Russian forces. Jon Wolfsthal, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama on arms control, said the United States had long been concerned about Russia's nuclear weapons. ""We have to be very careful about what we do and don't do when you have one country that is backed into a corner, has nuclear weapons and is actually talking about their possible use,"" Wolfsthal said in an interview. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow and fierce Putin critic, wrote it would be a mistake to dismiss Putin's message on nuclear arms. ""The people who know Putin the best - people I know in Russia - are worried about his recent nuclear statement. The people who know him the least are saying it's cheap talk,"" he wrote on Twitter. Francois Heisbourg, a senior adviser at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), agreed. ""People who say he is bluffing have only their gut feeling to rely upon. Whereas those who say he isn't bluffing can draw on a rich trove of circumstantial evidence,"" Heisbourg said. ""Because as far as Ukraine goes, he has not been bluffing. He doesn't do bluffing. He has been upfront in terms of what he wants.""

3/1/2022,"By David Brunnstrom and Michael Martina WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will keep its focus on the Indo-Pacific despite the Ukraine crisis, the White House Indo-Pacific policy coordinator said on Monday, adding Washington has been deeply engaged in two theaters simultaneously before, including during World War Two and the Cold War. ""It’s difficult. It’s expensive. But it is also essential, and I believe that we’re entering a period where that is what will be demanded of the United States and this generation of Americans,"" the official, Kurt Campbell, told an event hosted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States. ""There is a deep recognition and intention here inside the government, in the White House, to sustain every element of our engagement in the Indo-Pacific,” Campbell said. Campbell said coming months would show U.S. ""determination"" to sustain high-level engagement with the region President Joe Biden has declared a priority for policy and resources in pushing back against China's expanding influence. Biden plans to host a summit with Southeast Asian leaders in March and attend a summit of the Quad grouping of the United States, Australia, Japan and India in May. Campbell said Biden would travel too for meetings involving Southeast Asian states this year. Biden is also sending a delegation of former senior security officials to Taiwan on Monday in a show of support for the island amid fears that China might seek to take advantage of a distracted West to move against it. ""You will see a whole range of activities across the board, diplomatically, institutionally ... investment, and also economic and trade,"" Campbell said. Mira Rapp-Hooper, a director for U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy at the White House National Security Council, said she was confident that the Russian invasion of Ukraine would not divert from U.S. Indo-Pacific goals. ""There is a way that the resources we are sending to Ukraine right now are actually quite distinct from what we are trying to do on the Indo Pacific strategy,"" she said. ""That does not mean that we won’t feel moments of resource scarcity, but it does mean that we can plan both simultaneously."" Campbell and Rapp-Hooper said the world was watching closely China's position towards Russia's invasion, which happened three weeks after Beijing and Moscow announced an enhanced strategic partnership. The White House has called on China to condemn Russia's actions, the largest assault on a European state since World War Two. Campbell said China was in an awkward position, but Washington wanted to keep communication lines with Beijing open. He said he believed Chinese leaders ""have been concerned"" by the solidarity of U.S. allies and partners and also by the ""brutality"" of Russia's invasion. ""It is undeniable that right now China is occupying an awkward nexus in which they're trying to sustain their deep and fundamental relationship with Russia."" Campbell said it was too early to tell what conclusions China would draw, but Washington had explained to Beijing in advance the risks associated with Russia's invasion. ""It's clear from our perspective that the association, so public and so deep, between Russia and China is indeed quite uncomfortable right now."" Beijing has largely steered clear of criticizing Moscow, but has stressed its traditional position on the need to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity and last week abstained in a U.N. vote on a resolution condemning the Russian invasion. At the same event, the head of Asia policy for the European Union's diplomatic service, Gunnar Wiegand, also stressed the need to keep negotiation channels open with China, while the EU special envoy for the Indo-Pacific, Gabriele Visentin, said events in Ukraine would encourage the bloc to step up engagement with Asia.
