3/15/2022,"A newly released video showing a Miami police officer grabbed a handcuffed woman by the neck, threw her face first to the ground and knocked her unconscious will be reviewed by a police oversight group on Tuesday. The woman, who repeatedly yelled “don’t touch me,” filed a complaint days after the November 2020 incident. The body camera footage and surrounding circumstances are scheduled to be reviewed by the city of Miami’s Civilian Investigative Panel (CIP), at a public hearing at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday at Miami City Hall. The full panel’s review is the last step of the inquiry that is required after someone files a complaint of police misconduct at the CIP, and it is sometimes the first public discussion about use-of-force complaints against cops. Former Police Chief Art Acevedo mentioned the incident in a lawsuit against the city, in which he alleged an attempted cover-up of the officer’s behavior. Acevedo was fired in October 2021 amid controversy over public statements and after he alleged corruption in City Hall. In his lawsuit, he said Miami police officers had engaged in a “pattern of excessive use of force” and police supervisors had covered it up, citing the example of the woman being thrown to the ground. But the oversight agency’s inquiry found police supervisors acted correctly to fix initial reports that mischaracterized the incident, echoing the results of an investigation by police internal affairs. Fired police chief sues Miami, claims commissioners tried to ‘weaponize’ cops against enemies The officer had told the woman, then 20 years old, to leave the Little Havana gas station where she had been sitting on the sidewalk, after the owner called the police. As she walked away, she flicked ashes from her cigarette on the police vehicle. The officer, Miguel Hernandez, followed the woman to the next block where he confronted her about the cigarette stain. Joined by another officer, the two tried to force the woman to go back to the police car to clean the stain. The woman refused while cursing at the cops. The officers restrained the woman while Hernandez said she was resisting. They eventually led her back to the police car parked at the gas station where they placed her in the back seat. The video shows her screaming at the officer and at one point she spit on Hernandez. Seconds later, Hernandez grabbed the woman’s neck with both hands, dragged her out of the car and threw her to the ground. The second officer, who had turned away, immediately kneels down to check on the woman, who is unconscious, while he screamed at Hernandez. “What the hell did you do?” the officer yelled. “What the hell?” According to the CIP report, Hernandez resigned in June 2021 after the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office looked into the incident. Hernandez also relinquished his police license. A sergeant who arrived on the scene soon after, Carlos Mendez, filed a report explaining the use of force. He initially reported that Hernandez’s actions were reasonable and within state laws. A supervisor, Lieutenant Rodolfo Bertrand, later disagreed with the initial report and returned it to Mendez the same day. The interactions over the use-of-force report is what Acevedo cited in his lawsuit. Both the department’s internal affairs and the CIP found that Bertrand, the lieutenant, noted the problem and did not approve an incorrect report. Mendez retired from the force in August 2021. The CIP staff recommends closing the case against both officers who have left the force and exonerating Bertrand because he returned the incomplete report the same day. The agency did sustain allegations against another officer, Matthew Hall, who covered up his body camera with his hand and failed to unmute his camera in violation of department orders. The civilian panel has no disciplinary power. It can make recommendations to the police chief based on an independent assessment of whether or not department rules were followed. “During our complaints committee members of the panel were deeply shaken by the actions of the officer, and questioned his ability to do any law enforcement in America,” said Rodney Jacobs, assistant director of the CIP. “This is deeply concerning behavior that should never be tolerated and should spark the interest of the state attorney for criminal prosecution.” Herald staff writer Charles Rabin contributed to this report.",U.S./Miami Herald,Body camera footage shows former Miami cop throwing handcuffed woman to the ground,https://news.yahoo.com/body-camera-footage-shows-former-215801358.html

 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will not give his scheduled Monday address to the Council of Europe, citing ""urgent, unforeseen circumstances."" Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal is expected to speak in Zelensky's place, according to a Monday tweet from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. News that Zelensky will not address the council comes on the 19th day of Russia's invasion of his country. Ukraine experienced serious blows over the weekend in the conflict - at least 35 people were killed when a Russian missile strike hit a base less than 15 miles from Ukraine's border with Poland, and amid Ukrainian claims that a second mayor had been abducted by Russian forces. The two sides in the conflict, however, are meeting for a fourth round of peace talks on Monday via video conference. A top Ukrainian official said Kyiv will ask for peace, a cease-fire, the immediate withdrawal of troops and security guarantees. Previous peace discussions, which have taken place in person, did not reach any major breakthroughs. The Council of Europe has taken retaliatory actions against Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, suspending the country from the human rights organization. The group last month said its suspension of Russia would have an ""immediate effect"" in the Committee of Ministers and parliamentary assembly. Russia, however, was not fully ousted from the organization and is still obligated to follow its human rights conventions. Zelensky has emerged as a global hero during Russia's invasion of Ukraine, refusing to flee his country amid the conflict.",World/The Hill,"Zelensky won't address Council of Europe due to 'urgent, unforeseen circumstances'",https://news.yahoo.com/zelensky-wont-address-council-europe-123259604.html
3/15/2022,"BANGKOK (AP) — While Russia's war in Ukraine dominates global attention, Myanmar's military is targeting civilians in air and ground attacks on a scale unmatched in the country since World War II, according to a longtime relief worker who spent almost three months in a combat zone in the Southeast Asian nation. David Eubank, director of the Free Burma Rangers, a humanitarian relief organization, told The Associated Press that the military’s jets and helicopters stage frequent attacks in the areas of eastern Myanmar where he and his volunteers operate, bringing medical and food aid to civilians caught in conflict. Ground forces are also firing artillery — indiscriminately, he said — causing thousands to flee their homes. Video shot by his group’s members includes rare images of repeated air strikes by Myanmar military aircraft in Kayah State – also known as Karenni State — causing a number of civilian deaths. An analyst for New York-based Human Rights Watch said the air attacks constitute “war crimes.” Myanmar’s military seized power last year, overthrowing the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. After security forces cracked down violently on large, peaceful street demonstrations opposing the takeover, thousands of ordinary people formed militia units, dubbed People’s Defense Forces, to fight back. Many are loosely allied with well-established ethnic minority armed groups — such as the Karenni, the Karen and the Kachin — that have been fighting the central government for more than half a century, seeking greater autonomy in the frontier regions. Despite overwhelming superiority in numbers and weaponry, the military has failed to crush this grassroots resistance movement. The army has now stepped up attacks, taking advantage of the dry, summer conditions. Eubank described the fighting he had seen as probably the worst in Myanmar since World War II, when the country was a British colony still known as Burma and largely occupied by the Japanese. There has been serious but sporadic fighting in Kachin State in northern Myanmar for a few years, he said, “but what I saw in Karenni I had not seen in Burma before.” “Air strikes, not like one or two a day like they do in Karen State, but like two MiGs coming one after the other, these Yak fighters, it was one after the other,” said Eubank. “Hind helicopter gunships, these Russian planes, and then just brought hundreds of rounds of 120mm mortar. Just boom, boom, boom, boom.” Russia is a top arms supplier to Myanmar’s military, keeping up supplies even as many other nations have maintained an embargo since the army’s takeover to promote peace and a return to democratic rule. Eubank knows whereof he speaks. He was a U.S. Army Special Forces and Ranger officer before he and some ethnic minority leaders from Myanmar founded the faith-based Free Burma Rangers in 1997. Two of its members have been killed in Kayah state since late February: one in an air strike, the other in a mortar barrage. Drone footage shot by the group shows the impact of the army’s offensive on Karenni settlements, with buildings on fire and smoke drifting thick in the sky. In a Feb. 24 report in the state-run Myanma Alinn Daily newspaper, the military acknowledged using air strikes and heavy artillery in order to clear out what it called “terrorist groups” near the state capital, Loikaw. As casualties mount, people have to scramble for their lives, cowering in crude underground shelters topped with bamboo. A nighttime air raid on Feb. 23 that struck northwest of Loikaw left two villagers dead, three wounded and several buildings destroyed. “These are war crimes,” Manny Maung, the Myanmar researcher for Human Rights Watch, told AP. “These attacks by military on civilians, civilian buildings, killings of civilians, public buildings like religious buildings, yes, they are no less than war crimes that are happening right now in that particular area and this is because they are indiscriminately targeting civilians.” As well as in Kayah, the military is currently hitting hard in Sagaing, in upper central Myanmar, burning villages and heavily engaging with poorly armed militia units. The United Nations refugee agency says 52,000 people countrywide fled their homes in the last week of February. It puts the total figure of internally displaced since the military takeover at just over half a million. Casualty figures are unclear, given the government's control of information and the remoteness of the war zones. More than 1,670 civilians have been killed by the security forces since the army seized power in February last year, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group that monitors arrests and deaths. But its tallies are mainly from Myanmar's cities and generally lack casualties from combat in the countryside. “In the middle of all this we have Ukraine, which is a tragedy, and I’m really grateful for the help the world has galvanized behind Ukraine,"" Eubank said. “But the Karenni people ask me ‘Don’t we count? ... And of course, the people of Ukraine need help. But so do we. Why? Why isn’t anybody helping us?’”",World/Associated Press,Witness: Army attacks in eastern Myanmar worst in decades,https://news.yahoo.com/witness-army-attacks-eastern-myanmar-031443911.html
