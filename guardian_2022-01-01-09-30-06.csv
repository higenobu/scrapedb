1/1/2022,"The year ahead will be dominated by efforts to fight inflation along with climate change, while global economic growth will be reasonably strong and stock markets weak, according to an economic forecaster. The world starts the year with economies held back by a supply chain crisis and the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, but the global economy is still expected to grow by about 4% in 2022, compared with an estimated 5.1% in 2021, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), a UK thinktank.  Douglas McWilliams, the founder and executive deputy chairman of the CEBR, said the group had been forecasting 6.7% growth for the UK in 2021 but reduced it to 6.6% after a weak December. “We estimate £3bn or so of lost GDP from people staying at home and not spending, plus the impact of the restrictions in Wales and Scotland.” Similarly, the 2021 forecast for global growth was cut by 0.1 percentage points to 5.1%. The new year will start slowly for the UK, but as supply issues get resolved and with unspent savings burning holes in people’s pockets, GDP is forecast to grow by at least 4% in 2022. The biggest issue facing policymakers around the world, especially in the US and the UK, is likely to be inflation, the thinktank said. The Bank of England unexpectedly lifted interest rates in December after a rise in inflation to a decade high of 5.1% and signalled that more rate rises will follow in 2022 as soaring energy costs are expected to push inflation to 6% in the spring. The US Federal Reserve has pencilled in three rate hikes next year and accelerated the rate at which it cuts spending on government bonds in the face of what one official called “alarmingly high inflation”. The CEBR said inflation could jump beyond 6% in the UK and to more than 7% in the US, where it reached a 39-year high of 6.8% in November. While wages will also rise amid a tight labour market with declining unemployment and growing numbers of vacancies, soaring inflation will lead to a cost-of-living squeeze in the UK. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has warned that UK households are facing a “cost-of-living catastrophe” because of stalling wages, and rising tax and energy bills. In the face of higher interest rates and the rolling back of quantitative easing, global bond, equity and property markets are expected to fall around the world, with declines ranging from 10% to 25%, and some of the impact to last into 2023, the CEBR forecast. While 2021 was the year when environmental concerns went mainstream and the business sector took a more aggressive stance than governments, 2022 will be one “where policy has changed [and] pledges have been made but the technology is still in its early stages”, the CEBR said.",News/Business,"Global economy to grow by about 4% in 2022, says thinktank",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/01/global-economy-growth-forecast-2022-inflation
1/1/2022,"Britain’s small businesses should expect trade with the EU to be “permanently damaged” from 1 January, the refrigerated supply chain trade body has said, after new customs checks take effect that it says will make imports from the bloc “more expensive, less flexible and much slower”. Amid growing public dismay at the negative impact of Brexit, the Cold Chain Federation said speciality food imports could face the same 70% decline that affected exports of food by small businesses this year after Britain quit the EU single market and customs union.  Extra costs that amount to £300 to £400 for each consignment will mean sales of food to EU countries in small batches could become uneconomic, said the CCF, which lobbies on behalf of firms that transport frozen and chilled goods. “The big casualty of these trade barriers is the business that needs to import small and frequent quantities across borders – a palette load of speciality cheeses or boxes of onion powder. This is the sort of trade that is going to suffer,” said Shane Brennan, the federation’s chief executive. Business groups have called on the government to soften its stance in negotiations with the EU to prevent a collapse in trade with the 27-member bloc. But while ministers have agreed to extend the deadline for veterinary checks on food crossing the border, there has been little progress on cutting red tape. Mike Cherry, the chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said a survey in the autumn showed only a quarter of firms were prepared for the introduction of full import checks. “We don’t have any indication that the level of preparedness has improved, especially as the festive trading season has been so disrupted yet again,” he said, adding that one in five small firms that do business internationally had given up selling to clients in the EU since the transition period on exports ended. Rising food prices have played a large part in the increase in inflation over the past six months, and economists fear higher import charges will push up prices further, forcing the Bank of England to increase interest rates at a faster pace than anticipated. The consumer prices index reached 5.2% in November and is expected to rise above 6% in the spring as higher food import costs and an increase in gas prices push up the cost of living. This week Simon Spurrell, a co-founder of the Cheshire Cheese Company, said the hard Brexit pushed through by Boris Johnson was the “biggest disaster that any government has ever negotiated in the history of trade negotiations”. Cheese makers are among the sub-sectors of the food and drink industry to be hardest hit by new trade barriers. UK food and drink exports to the EU fell by 24% in the first nine months of 2021, according to figures from the Food and Drink Federation, which said the slump helped knock the sector’s exports by £2.7bn between January and September compared with pre-pandemic levels. Brennan said exports that occupy only a fraction of a container had suffered the most from extra customs checks on exports, and that was likely to be repeated when checks also apply to imports. He said importers would need to satisfy safety rules, provide customer declarations and have the necessary paperwork to ensure goods move through ports. “And all these must be synchronised to prevent things being even slower,” he said. Cherry said: “Unless the government steps in with more support, the situation is set to worsen.” The Institute of Directors said its economic confidence index had tumbled from -6 in November to -17 this month, a sign of nervousness among business owners about the UK’s economic prospects. It said three-quarters of company directors expected costs to rise in the next 12 months, and most said they would raise prices to either fully or partially offset the rise in costs. The Trades Union Congress said new checks on goods coming into the UK would damage the UK’s position as an important trading nation and the drive to create high-paying employment. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “With goods coming into the UK facing new paperwork, we could see further supply chain chaos, potentially hitting jobs in affected sectors. Government must invest in the infrastructure and jobs we need now to prevent further disruption.”",News/Politics,"New year Brexit changes ‘permanently damage’ EU trade, says food body",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/01/new-year-brexit-changes-permanently-damage-eu-trade-says-food-body
1/1/2022,"The Guardian’s racing correspondent, Greg Wood, was the UK’s leading newspaper tipster in 2021, finishing several lengths clear of the opposition in the Racing Post’s annual National Press Challenge in his first year as our lead tipster. Wood went to the top of the table in June and maintained a clear lead for the second half of the year, in a contest based on the total return to a notional £1 stake at starting price on all selections. The Guardian’s picks over the course of 2021 had the highest strike-rate of any tipster at 27.6%, and showed a return of just under 92% on turnover, nearly 2% higher than the runner-up.  In addition to individual winners at prices up to 28-1 during 2021, Wood’s selections at Royal Ascot in June showed a profit of £53.10 to a £1 level stake, including Perotto (Britannia Handicap) at 18-1, Lola Showgirl (Kensington Palace Stakes) at 12-1, two more winners at 10-1 and Subjectivist (13-2) in the Gold Cup, the feature event of the meeting. Other big-race winners included Commanche Falls (10-1) in the Stewards’ Cup at Goodwood in July and Midnight Shadow (9-1) in the Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham in November. Guardian sport Cheltenham is preparing to welcome as many as 30,000 racegoers to its traditional New Year’s Day card and many will look no further than the course specialist Coole Cody when it comes to the feature race, a handicap chase over two-and-a-half miles. The two courses at Cheltenham come alike to Evan Williams’s 11-year-old, whose three wins at this track include the Paddy Power Gold Cup in November 2020 and the valuable handicap at the December meeting three weeks ago. That form looks like the strongest on offer, but a 4lb higher mark makes life more difficult for Coole Cody and while his bold, front-running style makes him tough to pass, Zanza (2.00), who was two lengths behind him in second last time, could be worth an interest to turn the tables. That was Zanza’s second big run at Cheltenham in a row after finishing sixth in the Paddy Power, he is 2lb better off with the winner here and also runs in cheekpieces for the first time. That is another positive given that he comes from a yard which shows a level-stakes profit from more than 100 runners in first-time cheekpieces over the last 10 years. Cheltenham 1.25: L’Homme Presse has made a flawless start to his chasing career and still had plenty left in the tank when he finished 13 lengths clear at Ascot last time. This is a significant step up in grade but he has only six starts to his name in all and should bridge the gap with something to spare. Musselburgh 1.40: Stoner’s Choice remains on a fair mark based on his win at Kempton in November and the drop back in trip here should also be in his favour. Musselburgh 2.10: First Impression unseated his rider before halfway over track and trip last time but has a big chance on his winning form at Wetherby in November. Tramore 2.20: The dual Gold Cup winner Al Boum Photo has had his Festival warm-up in this race for the last three seasons and should make it four in a row with a minimum of fuss. Cheltenham 2.35: It takes a fair leap of faith to back Spiritofthegames here, even at around 16-1, as his 18-race losing streak stretches back to November 2018. He rarely runs a bad race at this track, however, reverts to hurdling off a competitive mark and should get the strong pace he needs to show his best. Cheltenham: 12.15 Get A Tonic, 12.50 The Wolf, 1.25 L’Homme Presse, 2.00 Zanza (nap), 2.35 Spiritofthegames, 3.10 McFabulous, 3.50 Iliade Allen  Catterick Bridge: 12.25 Bob’s Bar, 1.00 Fame And Hope, 1.35 Tommie Beau, 2.15 Socialist Agenda, 2.45 Spot On Soph, 3.20 Bestiarius Musselburgh: 12.30 Collingham, 1.05 Pitempton Power, 1.40 Stoner’s Choice, 2.10 First Impression (nb), 2.50 Amour De Nuit, 3.25 Morraman  Southwell: 12.33 Chillsea, 1.08 Paddy Elliott, 1.43 Lammas, 2.18 Arriviste, 2.53 Al Ameen, 3.28 Muscika, 4.00 Sky Power, 4.30 The Thin Blue Line  Exeter: 12.40 Gustavian,v 1.15 Dubrovnik Harry, 1.50 Gamaret, 2.25 Le Milos, 3.00 Keep Rolling, 3.35 Getaweapon, 4.05 Ben Bulben  Fakenham: 12.45 Powerful Position, 1.20 Hidor De Bersy, 1.55 Animal, 2.30 Ray’s The One, 3.05 Leave My Alone, 3.40 Henschke  Musselburgh 2.50: A small field but all five runners have a fair chance on their best form. Amour De Nuit is back below his last winning mark over fences and looks like the safest option. Cheltenham 3.10: A fascinating renewal of the Relkeel Hurdle, with McFabulous marginally preferred to likely favourite Brewin’upastorm as he returns to action after a wind op. He has gone well fresh in the past and anything close to his winning form when this race was switched to Kempton last year could well be sufficient.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: our tipping contest triumph and New Year’s Day pointers,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/01/talking-horses-tipster-triumph-cheltenham-saturday-tips
