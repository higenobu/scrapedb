4/8/2022,"Working from home. It was fun while it lasted? About three out of five managers believe that remote work is on the wane and workers will be back in the office full-time by the end of this year. And they’re apparently prepared to use some tough tactics to get workers back at their desks. About 77% of managers said they’d be willing to implement “severe consequences”—including firing workers or cutting pay and benefits—on those who refuse to return to the office, according to a recent survey by employment background check company GoodHire of 3,500 American managers. Although many surveys have shown that the majority of workers prefer remote and hybrid work structures, most managers still believe in-person work is best. Former Google CEO and chairman Eric Schmidt even recently weighed in about the return-to-work debate, saying that it's important people be at the office and he's happy the remote era seems to be ending. ""I don’t know how you build great management [with remote work]. I honestly don’t,"" he said. And about half of managers, 51%, genuinely believe that their workers want to return to the office. “Clearly, managers are struggling,” said Max Wesman, GoodHire’s chief operating officer. “Organizations that find a work arrangement that satisfies the majority of their workforce will benefit in the areas of recruitment, productivity, employee satisfaction, and retention.” When companies announce return-to-office plans, workers don’t have a lot of choice but to comply. Unless a worker was specifically hired for a remote position, they are probably required to work out of the office at least part of the time. Some workers (particularly those with health issues including an immunocompromised system, chronic kidney disease, serious heart conditions, diabetes, and obesity who may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infections) may be able to get remote work accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and state regulations, but that typically requires a formal review process. It's worth noting that only about 10% of employed Americans worked remotely in March because of COVID, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over half of workers, 50.9%, reported being already required to return in-person full-time, according to Workhuman’s April Human Workplace Index, a monthly survey of 1,000 full-time U.S. workers. But just because a company wants to head back to the office doesn’t mean it always goes smoothly. Financial giant Goldman Sachs, for example, reopened its New York headquarters in February and mandated its 10,000 employees return. Only about half showed up on the first day. That’s because despite the threats of severe consequences, workers do have some leverage right now thanks to the ongoing worker shortage. The U.S. had 11.3 million open jobs available in February, and that number hasn’t really wavered in recent months. So rather than spend a lot of time, effort, and money replacing noncompliant employees right now, some employers are letting it ride. But with warnings of a recession ahead, those workers who take their chances now by ignoring return-to-the-office mandates may find themselves to be at the top of the layoff list down the line—if not sooner.

4/8/2022,"Mitch McConnell said he's ""shocked"" to hear that he plays a ""ruthless"" style of politics. ""My wife thinks I'm a really nice guy,"" he told Axios. ""My kids like me."" ""I'm very comfortable with my moral red line,"" McConnell added. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday said he was ""shocked"" to hear that he's considered a ""ruthless"" politician, adding that his wife and children like him. ""You are known for playing a ruthless style of politics,"" Axios' Jonathan Swan told McConnell during an interview. ""Where do you draw your moral red lines?"" McConnell laughed, then replied: ""I didn't realize I was known for playing a ruthless — I thought, my wife thinks I'm a really nice guy."" McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, served as President Donald Trump's transportation secretary from 2017 to 2021 and as President George W. Bush's labor secretary from 2001 to 2009. ""My kids like me. I got a lot of friends,"" McConnell added. ""I'm shocked to hear such a comment."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to Congress on Wednesday to appeal for more assistance in his country's fight against Russian forces. Swan pressed McConnell, saying that some people in the country might agree with the ""ruthless"" characterization and asking him again where he draws his ""moral red lines."" ""I'm perfectly comfortable with the way that I have conducted my political career,"" said McConnell, who's served in the Senate since 1985. ""I'm very comfortable with my moral red line."" Swan then asked McConnell to explain his thinking behind supporting Trump after condemning him over the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. On the Senate floor on February 13, 2021, McConnell declared that ""Trump's actions preceding the riot were a disgraceful dereliction of duty."" ""There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day,"" he said at the time. Swan asked the GOP leader about his ""moral red line."" ""How do you go from saying that, to two weeks later, saying you'd absolutely support Donald Trump if he's the Republican leader in 2024?"" Swan asked. McConnell defended his position, explaining that he has an ""obligation"" to support whoever the Republican party nominates. ""As the Republican leader of the Senate, it should not be a front-page headline that I would support the Republican nominee for president,"" he said. Trump has not launched a 2024 presidential bid, but has repeatedly hinted he may run again. As Swan continued to question McConnell on his position, the Republican leader responded, ""I say many things I'm sure people don't understand.""
