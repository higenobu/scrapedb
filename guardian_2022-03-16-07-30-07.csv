3/16/2022,"Ralf Rangnick was asked after Manchester United’s victory over Tottenham on Saturday whether he thought his team could win the Champions League. It was all he could do not to laugh. After the funeral, in his words, that was the derby defeat at Manchester City the previous weekend, the question did not make sense, according to the interim manager. Perhaps it is the hope that gets to people. Or the reality that United are a club that only seems to deal in the wildest of extremes. This was the night when it all came crashing back down, United’s flickers of promise ground into the dust by Atlético Madrid and the team given an extremely familiar sinking feeling on Europe’s grandest stage. United have progressed only twice in the Champions League knockout rounds since their run to the final in 2011 and, in the final analysis over these two legs, they did not do enough. Trailing to Renan Lodi’s goal before half-time, they were charged with prising Atlético apart in the second half and they barely threatened. After the final whistle, Diego Simeone was pelted with bottles from the crowd as he ran towards the dressing room. United knew their season was on the line. The battle for a top-four Premier League finish endures but what is the point of that if not to make an assault on the Champions League knockout rounds? The potential for glory had been in front of them and everybody inside Old Trafford could feel it – the excitement mixing with the nerves. The atmosphere pulsed. The hosts were keen to set the right tone, getting on to the front foot and firing up the crowd, even if was always going to be a balancing act. Rangnick had to be wary of Atlético’s counters, which was part of the reason why he went for Scott McTominay and Fred in front of the back four. One thing that could be said without fear of contradiction was that United’s opening was better than it had been in Madrid and they were so close to translating their attacking expression into a goal. Cristiano Ronaldo was everywhere at the outset, beginning with a keepy-uppy dribble and also driving to the byline at pace, winning a corner. It was his pass that released Bruno Fernandes in the 13th minute and, when the midfielder crossed, Anthony Elanga had timed his run to apply the close-range flicked finish. The ball smacked into Jan Oblak’s head and flew to safety. The goalkeeper knew nothing about it. Elanga had also gone close with a second-minute header. United’s early confidence was reflected by Fred, who pulled off some outrageous tricks, none better than the touch into his standing foot close to the byline followed by the blast past his opponent. His cut-back led to nothing but United were making the game and it was enjoyable to watch. The worry was that they had nothing to show for it and Atlético had certainly fired warning shots. Rodrigo De Paul extended David de Gea with a pot-shot for the top corner on 16 minutes while the excellent João Félix had a goal ruled out following Koke’s lovely pass and Marcos Llorente’s low cross. Llorente had strayed marginally offside. The breakthrough goal followed Elanga shouting in vain for a foul by Reinildo Mandava as he raced up the right. There had been contact and so Elanga thought he would get the decision when he went down. He did not. Perhaps he tumbled too late. It was no excuse, though, for how Diogo Dalot lost his bearings at the far post after Atlético went up to the other end, Antoine Griezmann crossing after a Félix backheel. Lodi tiptoed in, completely unmarked, to plant a header down and in. United had finished the first half with Fernandes unloading from distance and Oblak turning behind and they simply had to find a way through after the interval. This is not, perhaps, a classic Simeone team and the Madrid press had described them as being in crisis before the first leg, their title defence long since in tatters; the statistics showing six league defeats in a 10-game stretch. But there have since been four straight wins in the league; signs of a few of the old certainties coming back. Atlético fought for every yard, with even their substitutes, who included Luis Suárez, getting in the way of a United throw-in up one of the sidelines. Simeone ordered every one of his players to stay behind the ball, to compress the space between the lines and United could feel the frustration mounting. Elanga dragged wide at the start of the second period; Jadon Sancho fizzed a volley high. For Atlético, De Paul shot at De Gea after the goalkeeper, played into trouble by Harry Maguire, had misdirected a clearance. United needed to keep the back door shut because Atlético continued to look threatening on the break. Maguire failed to inspire much confidence. But what they really needed, as Rangnick made his substitutions, including the introduction of Edinson Cavani as a second striker, and Juan Mata for Maguire, was a chance. Raphaël Varane had the only one of note with a 77th-minute header that worked Oblak. The frustration was overwhelming and United now know that their trophy drought will extend into a fifth year.",Sport/Football,Manchester United out of Champions League after Atlético Madrid triumph,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/15/manchester-united-atletico-madrid-champions-league-last-16-match-report
3/16/2022,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy told reporters “with allies like this we will win this war” after the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia made a perilous train journey to Kyiv to offer their support. The comments from Ukraine’s president followed an extraordinary meeting with the three EU leaders in a capital which is close to being encircled by Russian forces. They are the first western visitors to Kyiv since the war began two weeks ago. In footage of the meeting posted on social media, Zelenskiy was heard briefing the EU leaders on the latest military and humanitarian situation and the negotiations with Russia. “They are shelling everywhere,” Zelenskiy is heard telling them. “Not only Kyiv but also the western areas.” He also informed the Czech, Polish and Slovenian prime ministers, Petr Fiala, Mateusz Morawiecki and Janez Janša, that three Chechen brigades had been identified among the Russian forces. Zelenskiy expressed gratitude for their visit, calling it a “powerful testimony of support”. On arrival in Kyiv, after a three-hour journey, a photograph of the three men, and Poland’s deputy prime minister Jarosław Kaczyński who had accompanied the leaders, was published of them studying a map of Ukraine in a wood-panelled room in an undisclosed location. Morawiecki tweeted: “It is here, in war-torn Kyiv, that history is being made. It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance. EU supports Ukraine, which can count on the help of its friends – we brought this message to Kyiv today.” Fiala tweeted: “The aim of the visit is to express the European Union’s unequivocal support for Ukraine and its freedom and independence. “At the same time, we will present a broad package of support for Ukraine and its citizens during the visit. The international community has also been informed of this visit by international organisations, including the United Nations.” In statements from their respective capitals ahead of the meeting with Zelenskiy, it was said that they would be offering their support to Ukraine’s president as representatives of the other 24 EU heads of state and government. Janša tweeted: “Europe must guarantee Ukraine’s independence and ensure that it is ready to help in Ukraine’s reconstruction.” The visit came as the emergency services in Kyiv said at least five further people had been killed due to shelling in the capital, including on a 15-storey apartment building shortly before dawn on Tuesday. A downtown subway station that had been used as a bomb shelter was also damaged. City authorities tweeted an image of its blown-out facade. Kyiv has been spared the worst of the fighting since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February but the Russian military has been gradually encircling the capital. The Polish government said the visit by the three EU leaders to Ukraine and its capital was made in agreement with the presidents of the European Commission and Council, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel. The leaders were in Kyiv, the statement had said, as “representatives of the European Council”. “The purpose of the visit is to confirm the unequivocal support of the entire European Union for the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine and to present a broad package of support for the Ukrainian state and society,” the Polish government’s statement said. But EU officials in Brussels said there was some nervousness about the visit and diplomats for some capitals said they had not been notified until minutes before the trip was announced. The meeting came as MPs from across the continent voted to expel Russia from the Council of Europe, the continent’s leading human rights organisation, over the invasion of Ukraine in a further sign of the Kremlin’s estrangement from the western democratic order. The vote has huge symbolic value, although it became something of a formality, after Russia announced earlier on Tuesday that it was quitting, effectively jumping before it was pushed. MPs from the Council of Europe’s 46 other member countries voted for a resolution that said: “In the common European home, there is no place for an aggressor.” The EU member states also formally agreed on a fourth sanctions package on Tuesday morning, including an asset freeze and travel ban on the Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich. He is described in the EU’s legal text as “a Russian oligarch who has long and close ties to Vladimir Putin”. “He has had privileged access to the president, and has maintained very good relations with him,” the text adds. “This connection with the Russian leader helped him to maintain his considerable wealth. “He is a major shareholder of the steel group Evraz, which is one of Russia’s largest taxpayers.” The new round of sanctions against Putin’s regime includes an EU import ban on a range of sensitive steel products and a ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector, with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU. The EU is also imposing a ban on the export of luxury goods, such as cars and jewellery, with a value of €300 (£250) or more. A ban on the rating of Russia and Russian companies by EU credit rating agencies and the provision of rating services to Russian clients will also be imposed.",News/World news,"Polish, Czech and Slovenian prime ministers arrive in Kyiv",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/polish-czech-and-slovenian-prime-ministers-travel-to-kyiv-ukraine
3/16/2022,"Andrew Harper, a police constable with Thames Valley police, disappeared from view suddenly, “like a waterskier coming off the rope”, as his partner that night later described it. They had been off duty when a call about three young men stealing a quad bike nearby had come in, but attended anyway. They caught up with the gang, one of whom – in order to make a speedier getaway – was unhooking the bike they had been towing with a car as Harper got out of the police car to try to apprehend him. The thief dived through the gang’s car window and it drove off. The tow rope caught Harper by the feet. He was dragged a mile, and to his death. Presented by Sir Trevor McDonald in full sonorous voice mode, The Killing of PC Harper: A Widow’s Fight for Justice (ITV) recaps the terrible story, which dominated headlines in 2019. There is dashcam and helicopter footage aplenty, with the suppressed but growing panic in officers’ voices – as they keep one another informed of the unfolding crime – telling more of the story than their words. Bodycam footage of the three suspects’ arrest shows, from the off, the trio’s irrepressible bravado and lack of compunction, which would later become a feature of the trial – and the media reporting around it. “He’s upsetting me!” one suspect says about the arresting officer. “Because he’s calling me a murderer!” Another recap of the investigation is followed by an emotional interview with Lissie Harper, PC Harper’s widow, only four-weeks married at the time of her husband’s death. Calm, poised and articulate while still clearly stricken with grief, she describes the night in awful, measured terms. The knock on the door. The assumption that Andrew had forgotten his keys. Seeing the officer in uniform on the doorstep, “and thinking – well, this isn’t right”. Being told that he had died (“the most alien thing”) and that it hadn’t been, as she had assumed, an accident. “This secondary shock – someone’s taken his life.” Her mother, Julie, recalls watching her collapse afterwards and being powerless to take the pain away. Andrew’s friend Andy Fiddler remembers him as “a big bundle of joy to work with and to know”. It is often remarked how camera-ready all Americans are, and it does seem that they have a great facility to turn any event, no matter how small or large, into a compelling, accessible verbal account at a moment’s notice. Less talked about is how anyone who is talking about a genuine, deeply felt experience can do the same. Authenticity gives them a particular and unmistakable dignity. No one who hears an account of a shocking bereavement such as Lissie’s (or in other documentaries, people talking about serious illness, sexual assaults, dementia or innumerable other traumas) can remain unmoved or uncompassionate. One day, documentary producers – and, it must be said, ITV is generally behind the curve compared with the BBC, though the latter is not uniform in its approach either – will realise that this makes any attempt to convey horror elsewhere in the programme look crass and sensationalist. The top of this documentary is full of cliches delivered as if they were the sermon on the mount. There are also problems with Sir Trevor’s attempts to convey what he had been told (“Almost unimaginable … what a horrifying, fateful end to someone’s life”) as if an account of a man being dragged to his death, from one of his colleagues, needed further bolstering. Beyond that there was the difficulty of the specific point of this programme, which seemed to be to raise the profile of Harper’s Law, for which Lissie has campaigned since the suspects arrested for her husband’s murder were convicted only of manslaughter (they are all likely be released in a decade – when they will still be younger than 28-year-old Andrew was when he died). The new law, to be included in a bill expected to pass in a few months’ time, will make life sentences mandatory for anyone convicted of killing an emergency worker during the commission of a crime. It has been supported by the home secretary, Priti Patel, throughout, which will be a red flag to many, but critics’ objections got only the briefest mention towards the end of the hour. Although it seemed clear that for Lissie the campaign had been a distraction from her grief and its success cathartic (“otherwise it’s just a disgusting waste of an amazing person’s life”), there was certainly nothing even approaching a consideration of whether laws born of emotion are always good laws, or whether a draconian home secretary can sometimes use people’s pain and sympathies to advance her own agenda without having to face as much opposition.

3/16/2022,"England have been preparing for Saturday’s final Six Nations match, against France, by perfecting their chop tackles to avoid another nightmare red-card scenario in Paris, and Eddie Jones has left Max Malins out of his squad to face Les Bleus. Charlie Ewels was sent off after 82 seconds in Saturday’s defeat by Ireland for an upright, head-on-head collision with James Ryan– deemed a dangerous tackle by the referee, Mathieu Raynal. As a result Jones’s squad have this week been focusing on their tackle technique and ensuring they go low against the grand-slam chasing French. Jones, meanwhile, has left Malins – one of only three players to appear in every minute of England’s campaign to date – out of the 28-man squad that flew to Paris on Tuesday. The 25-year-old was impressive against Italy in round two but, with England managing a combined total of only two tries against Scotland, Wales and Ireland, Malins has seemingly paid the price for their misfiring attack. Elliot Daly would appear the favourite to take his place on the wing but Louis Lynagh, Luke Northmore and George Furbank have also travelled to France. Jack Willis has returned to Wasps after briefly joining the squad, strongly suggesting Sam Underhill will replace the injured Tom Curry at openside flanker, while Nic Dolly is set to come on to the bench in place of Jamie Blamire, who has been left out after a botched lineout throw late on against Ireland. Alfie Barbeary is again among the 28 as the 21-year-old waits for a debut. Whichever way Jones shuffles his side, they have been given a clear reminder of the need to be accurate with their tackles. “It is probably something that everyone needs to work on anyway, the height in tackle,” said the No 8 Sam Simmonds. “Against a huge French pack you don’t want to be going too high against them anyway. It is something we talked about this week. Leicester Tigers have avoided a points deduction but beenfined more than £300,000 following a salary cap investigation by PremiershipRugby. The Tigers were deemed to have failed to comply with salary capregulations for five consecutive seasons and while their financial penalty is,by a distance, the second largest in history behind Saracens, they will berelieved that harsher punishment was not forthcoming. PRL’s investigation found that Leicester entered into anarrangement with a third party who made payments to the image rights companiesof Leicester players. Those payments, made over the four seasons from 2016-17 to2019-20, should have been disclosed within the salary cap but were not. Leicester escaped formal charges – such as a points deduction– however, because the salary cap was exceeded by less than the “overrun” limit(£325,000 in the first season and £350,000 thereafter). Their highest overrunwas £147,750. That has left the Tigers with an overrun tax bill of £291,941.06,plus an additional fine of £17,900 for failing to disclose information regardingthe arrangement. Last season Leicester were deemed to be under the salary capbut the fine includes non-disclosure during that campaign. PRL’s salary capmanager Andrew Rogers said: “While we are satisfied that the arrangements whichresulted in the overspend have been brought to an end, we will continue toassess all spending as part of our ongoing monitoring process at every club.” Gerard Meagher “Our chop tackles need to be good and our second man needs to be good to wrap the ball up as well because they love to offload the ball, they are very good in unstructured play. That is probably where they get most of their momentum, offloads and unstructured and they are very good at that. That is something we have talked about this week, our tackle height and just chopping the big fellas down, making them get up and hopefully they tire towards the end of the game.” Defeat in Paris could leave England in fifth place in the Six Nations table for the second year in a row and would heighten the pressure on Jones. On Monday, Jones acknowledged the extra scrutiny he is facing, suggesting it was, in part, because he is Australian, but Simmonds was adamant the head coach has the backing of the squad regardless of Saturday’s result. “I feel like, as a group, probably this campaign more than any other we’ve come together as a squad,” he added. “Although that maybe hasn’t been reflected in the results against Scotland and Ireland, I feel like people could see at Twickenham what it meant for us to play for England. Also we’re not just playing for England, we’re playing for the coaches. That’s big to see that, and how much confidence we have in what Eddie does and in how we play the game at the weekend.”",Sport/Sport,England focus on chop tackles to avoid further red cards against France,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/15/england-six-nations-rugby-focus-on-chop-tackles-to-avoid-further-red-cards-against-france
3/16/2022,"Prestigious British law firms have been complicit in helping oligarchs prevent legitimate media scrutiny of their activities, MPs have been told.Two journalists, who have recently been on the receiving end of legal action over their reporting on oligarchs, told MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee of the tactics typically used by law firms acting for powerful interests. They said this had pushed up insurance premiums to provide legal cover and many publishers had taken fright over the issue.Tom Burgis, a Financial Times journalist, named a number of firms, including Carter-Ruck and Schillings, and told MPs of the type of letters which were often sent.“In my experience they are often written in a tone of righteous indignation where the journalist is said to have behaved appallingly,” he said, in answer to a question from MP Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the committee hearing a session into the “use of strategic lawsuits against public participation”, also known as SLAPPs. “What you are threatened with – and I have spent a long time trying to work out why journalists recoil [from covering some of these issues] – and it’s because you risk humiliation in the public square. It works on that basis, as well as the massive threat of costs.”Catherine Belton, another journalist who appeared alongside Burgis, agreed with Tugendhat when he asked if British courts were being used “as tools of intimidation”.However, she said that the invasion of Ukraine had led to a sea-change.“The coverage of oligarchs is as different as night from day. Before, it was almost as if there was a reign of terror. The oligarchs were deploying all these reputation managers,” she said, adding that it was “never heard” how Roman Abramovich had been “an enabler of Putin.” Last year, Abramovich settled his libel claim against Belton over her bestselling book Putin’s People – described in the Guardian as “the essential book to understand the Russian president” – after an agreement was reached.Earlier this month, an attempt by a Kazakh mining giant to sue Burgis for allegedly claiming it ordered the murders of three men was was stopped by a judge who said the case was flawed because readers would know that only individuals can commit murder, rather than corporations.",News/Law,"British law firms help oligarchs avoid legitimate media scrutiny, MPs told",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/15/british-law-firms-help-oligarchs-avoid-legitimate-media-scrutiny-mps-told
