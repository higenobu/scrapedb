1/14/2022,"One of the earliest contemporary broadside editions of the Declaration of Independence is to go on sale later this year, as part of an auction of the private library of William S. Reese – the most prominent antiquarian book dealer of his generation. The collection of “Bill” Reese, including printed works, historic prints, fine art and colour-plate books, will be among the most valuable sales of printed Americana in over 50 years, Christie’s said, giving it a “conservative” pre-sale estimate of $12-18m.  The edition of the Declaration of Independence is likely the first edition printed in New England, and matches almost exactly the typesetting used for the edition printed in the 16 July 1776 issue of the American Gazette. Only six copies are recorded extant, with four housed in institutions including Georgetown University, Harvard University, the Massachusetts Historical Society, and the Peabody Essex Museum. It is estimated to sell for between $1m and $1.5m. Christina Geirger, head of the books and manuscripts department at Christie’s New York, said seeing Reese’s private library for the first time “was one of the most thrilling experiences of my life”. She added: “The books and artwork so clearly embody Bill’s passion for history, evidenced in both written and visual culture. The library was a special place of both sanctuary and adventure, of intellectual rigour and humour, of grandeur and approachability – all these elements held in exquisite balance with exceptional taste.” Born in 1955, Reese was a seminal figure in antiquarian Americana with a keen interest in natural history, government and politics, travel and literature. He founded the eponymous William Reese Company of New Haven, Connecticut, in 1979, and over the next 40 years, the company became the leader in the Americana market. The antiquarian books firm was situated adjacent to the Yale University campus and housed more than 18,000 items. Reese also worked closely with Yale’s Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library to shape its Americana collections. In 1998, he established the Reese Fellowship in the Print Culture of the Americas, which has offered research grants to more than 150 scholars. Other highlights from the auction include a copy of Paul Revere’s 1770 engraving of the Boston Massacre ($250,000 to $300,000), a first edition of John Smith’s “General History of Virginia, New England and the Summer Isles” from 1624 ($300,000 to $500,000), and rare editions of John James Audubon and Herman Melville. A series of themed live and online auctions will be held in New York beginning 25 May , and highlights from the collection will be unveiled to the public at an exhibition that opened on Thursday and runs until 28 January, marking the first time in over 30 years that any portion of the current collection has been publicly exhibited.",News/US news,Earliest edition of US Declaration of Independence to go on sale,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/13/earliest-edition-of-us-declaration-of-independence-to-go-on-sale
1/14/2022,"California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has denied parole for Sirhan Sirhan, the 77-year-old who has spent more than 50 years in prison for the assassination of Robert F Kennedy. Newsom has previously cited Kennedy as his “political hero” and wrote in his decision rejecting parole: “After decades in prison, he has failed to address the deficiencies that led him to assassinate Senator Kennedy. Mr Sirhan lacks the insight that would prevent him from making the same types of dangerous decisions he made in the past.”  Sirhan was approved for release by the parole board last year after two of Kennedy’s sons argued in favor of his release and prosecutors did not object. The board ruled that he was not a danger to public safety in the wake of new laws that required the panel to consider that he committed the offense at a young age. Sirhan originally faced a death sentence for the 1968 killing of Kennedy, who was a Democratic US senator from New York and the former US attorney general. He was murdered at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles moments after declaring victory in the California presidential primary. Sirhan repeatedly testified that he did not recall shooting Kennedy and injuring five others, but in his recent parole hearing, he said he took responsibility for the killing. Douglas Kennedy, who was a toddler when his father was killed, attended last year’s hearing and urged for his release, saying he was moved to tears by Sihran’s remorse, the AP reported: “I’m overwhelmed just by being able to view Mr Sirhan face-to-face. I think I’ve lived my life both in fear of him and his name in one way or another. And I am grateful today to see him as a human being worthy of compassion and love.” Robert F Kennedy Jr, another son, also recently urged that Newsom free Sihran, noting that the state’s own psychiatrists deemed he was not a threat to society, and raising questions about police’s original investigation. He met with Sirhan in 2018 and said he found him to be a “gentle, humble, kindhearted, frail and harmless”. Paul Schrade, a victim who survived the shooting, has also argued for his release. Other children have argued against his release, including Rory Kennedy, who never met his father. This is a developing story.

1/14/2022,"Mikel Arteta needed a show of character from Arsenal at a ground where they have displayed little in recent years. He appeared to require a miracle too when Granit Xhaka’s latest red card gave Liverpool 66 minutes plus five minutes of stoppage time to seize control of the Carabao Cup semi-final. He received both, and more, as Arsenal produced a tireless display to stifle Jürgen Klopp’s team at Anfield. There is a long way to go in this semi-final but the reaction to the final whistle demonstrated where the advantage lies, and who departed the first leg with greater belief. Arsenal’s exhausted players exchanged high-fives while their fans celebrated a goalless draw in the Anfield Road stand. Liverpool lacked inspiration and penetration throughout, and must rediscover both to progress to a final meeting with Chelsea on 27 February.  The two managers selected arguably their strongest available teams, although the squad available to Klopp was undoubtedly stronger than the one at Arteta’s disposal as Covid, injuries and the Africa Cup of Nations had a greater impact on Arsenal’s depth. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s first appearance in the competition for five years underlined the seriousness of the Liverpool manager’s approach to the semi-final. A hip injury suffered in the first minute by Cédric Soares, who was deputising at right back for the injured Takehiro Tomiyasu and forced off 10 minutes later, reflected the Arsenal manager’s misfortune. But it would not end there. Arsenal made a vibrant start and were committed to attacking in numbers when an opportunity arose on the counterattack. That policy had to be abandoned, however, when Xhaka was shown a straight red card for denying Diogo Jota a clear goalscoring opportunity, while volleying him in the ribs for good measure. The pattern of the tie turned in an instant. One moment Arsenal were on the front foot with Bukayo Saka breaking down the right and crossing low towards Eddie Nketiah, who failed to connect at full stretch, plus Alexandre Lacazette, who was also unable to apply a finishing touch. The next, they were carved open at the back by Andy Robertson’s long diagonal ball towards Jota. The Portugal international was ghosting in on Xhaka’s blindside and set to go clean through on Aaron Ramsdale’s goal when the Arsenal midfielder made an honest, if desperate, attempt to hook clear. He connected with the Liverpool forward’s chest instead and referee Michael Oliver immediately brandished the fifth red card of Xhaka’s Arsenal career. As the Switzerland international sloped off, after arguing his lost cause with Oliver for a lengthy period, Arteta consulted his backroom staff over their emergency measures. The result was Rob Holding for the unfortunate Nketiah and a switch to a five-man defence. That understandable move left the visitors with a fragile-looking midfield three of Saka, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Gabriel Martinelli, but the trio dug in to help frustrate Liverpool for the remainder of the first half. Klopp’s team had dominated possession from the start but their clearer openings before the break came against the 11 men of Arsenal. Ramsdale was fortunate when Jordan Henderson charged down his attempted clearance and the rebound spun wide of the open goal. The goalkeeper smothered the Liverpool captain’s second bite on the by-line.Ben White almost put through his own goal when steering a dangerous cross from Takumi Minamino away from the lurking Roberto Firmino and just wide of the far post. Robertson’s right-footed shot was then deflected wide by Lokonga. Against 10 men, however, the hosts initially found it a struggle to find a way through. To Arsenal’s credit they did not simply retreat into preservation mode before next week’s second leg at the Emirates. Saka looked to attack Liverpool’s left flank whenever he received possession while Kieran Tierney pressed forward as a wing back on the opposite flank. But their duties were mostly confined, unsurprisingly, to shutting down Liverpool’s attacking options. Minamino went close early in the second half with a miscued cross that sailed over Ramsdale and just wide of the far post, though chances remained at a premium. It was another 20 minutes before Liverpool, and Minamino, troubled Ramsdale again, the Japan international shooting wide from a tight angle after being released by Robertson’s slick pass. By the 70th minute, neither team had produced a shot on target. The team with a valid excuse erased their blank two minutes later. Tierney found time and space on the left to pick out Saka’s run into the Liverpool penalty area with an inviting cross. The Arsenal winger, who would add to Arteta’s injury worries with an apparent hamstring problem, took an awkward first touch before attempted to lift his second over the advancing Alisson. The Liverpool goalkeeper produced an important block at close range, to the obvious despair of Saka and the Arsenal bench. But the greater frustration belonged to Liverpool. Klopp made a triple substitution in an attempt to freshen his side and introduced both Curtis Jones and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to inject much-needed creativity into midfield. The effect was minimal. Two substitutes combined to create Liverpool’s best opening of the night in the 90th minute when Neco Williams found Oxlade-Chamberlain. His cross was taken out of Ramsdale’s hands by a header from Lokonga. The miscued clearance dropped to Minamino in front of an open goal. He had to score. He sliced high into the Kop instead.",Sport/Football,Arsenal dig in to deny Liverpool in first leg despite Granit Xhaka red card,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/13/liverpool-arsenal-carabao-cup-semi-final-first-leg-match-report
1/14/2022,"Covid restrictions in Wales such as a limit on the number of people who can attend a sporting match and curbs on hospitality businesses may be lifted by the end of the month. The first minster, Mark Drakeford, will set out a two-week plan on Friday to ease restrictions that have been in place since Boxing Day.  The move will be phased, with restrictions on outdoor activities lifted first, and could be halted if the public health situation worsens. But as long as cases do not rise dramatically again, it seems likely that crowds will be allowed back for the Six Nations rugby tournament, which begins in February. Wales is in “alert level 2”, meaning nightclubs are closed, a maximum of six people can meet in a pub and only up to 50 people can watch outside sporting events or take part in an activity such as parkrun. The Tories in Wales have claimed the stricter conditions have made the country an “outlier” while the night-time industry has been highly critical of the restrictions it is operating under. Drakeford will set out how Wales plans to move back to alert level 0 at his weekly press conference in Cardiff. In a statement the administration said: “The Welsh government is able to start removing the protections put in place in response to the Omicron wave, thanks to the support of people across Wales and the successful booster campaign – more than 1.75 million people have had the extra booster dose. The move to alert level 0 will be phased, with restrictions on outdoor activities being removed first.” Earlier on Thursday the Welsh health minister, Eluned Morgan, said she hoped Wales was reaching the Omicron peak. Giving evidence to the Welsh parliament’s health and social care committee, she said: “There are some very positive signs, I’m pleased to say, in terms of us possibly turning the corner, which would be a huge, huge relief.”",News/World news,Wales moves to ease Covid restrictions by end of January,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/wales-covid-restrictions-mark-drakeford-plan
