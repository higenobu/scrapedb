3/24/2022,"Putin advisors are ""on edge"" as the Ukraine war devolves into a debacle for Russia, an expert said. Andrei Soldatov said Russia's military failures had shown cracks within Russian leadership. ""It looks like everybody is on edge,"" the expert on Russia's military and security services said. Russian President Vladimir Putin's advisors are ""on edge"" as Russia's war with Ukraine has devolved into a debacle — with Russian troops met by stronger Ukrainian resistance than anticipated, an expert told The New York Times. ""It looks like everybody is on edge,"" Andrei Soldatov, an author and expert on Russia's military and security services, told the news outlet in a report published Tuesday. Soldatov said Russia's military failures in its monthlong war with Ukraine had begun to show cracks within Russian leadership. When Putin launched his attack on Ukraine on February 24, he expected a swift victory, with the capital of Kyiv quickly falling to Russian forces, Western defense officials have said. It's now a month into the war, and Ukraine's resistance has largely stalled the Russian military's advances. Putin's forces have since intensified their assault on multiple Ukrainian cities, including bombing and shelling residential buildings and hospitals. ""We can definitively say that nothing is going to plan,"" Pavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst, told The Times. ""It has been decades since the Soviet and Russian armies have seen such great losses in such a short period of time."" Putin has reportedly begun purging his inner circle as the invasion drags on. Earlier this month, Ukrainian media reported that Roman Gavrilov, the head of the Russian national guard, had been fired by Putin. A Russian newspaper, Kommersant, reported Gavrilov had resigned. A week prior, Soldatov said the ousted officials included the top Russian intelligence official tasked with managing the recruitment of spies and diversionary operations in Ukraine and his deputy, who have both been placed under house arrest. Even Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who spends summer vacations with Putin and has been eyed as the Russian leader's prospective successor, has seen his status decline, The Times reported, citing Soldatov's sources. The Times said it could not independently verify Soldatov's claims but added that Shoigu had not been seen meeting with Putin in person since February 27 — three days after Russia invaded Ukraine. According to The Times, some in Putin's orbit have voiced dissent over the war, including a former Federal Security Service official who said Russia had ""underestimated"" Ukraine and a group of Russian military officers who said invading Ukraine would be ""pointless and extremely dangerous"" and threaten the future of Russia. Ukraine's military claimed earlier this week that it had killed 15,000 Russian troops and several top generals since February 24. The US estimates around 7,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine — more than the number of American troops lost in either the Afghanistan or Iraq wars. Ukraine has been armed by the US and European allies, but even the Ukrainian-made anti-tank missile is wrecking the Russian offensive. Since the start of the war, the Russian aerospace forces have grown increasingly risk averse, even going so far as to skirt Ukrainian airspace to avoid being shot down by the countries anti-aircraft weapons. As of March 19, at least 13 top Russian generals and commanders have been killed in the fighting in Ukraine. Russian commanders are moving up towards the frontline in an attempt to restore momentum to the invasion of Ukraine according to western officials, said Gordon Corera, a BBC security correspondent, in a tweet. Jeffrey Edmonds, a former US Army tanker and CIA military analyst, told Insider that he attributes the high casualty rate to a poorly trained Russian army which wasn't aware it would be in active combat. ""I've seen reports about units being destroyed and things of that nature,"" Edmonds said of the Russian army. ""Typically, we think in the military that if you lose a third of your unit, then you're combat-ineffective because usually, psychologically, one in three dying or being taken out of the fight, your unit typically can't function well after that.""

3/24/2022,"Donald Trump and his children Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump have filed an appeal in their fight against the New York attorney general’s attempt to depose them as part of a civil investigation into the Trump Organization. Their lawyers argue that a lower court erred by denying the Trumps’ request to quash their subpoenas for testimony. Meanwhile, adult entertainer Stormy Daniels said she would rather serve time behind bars than pay the legal fees she owes Donald Trump after her defamation lawsuit against the former president failed — “I will go to jail before I pay a penny,” she tweeted. The former president began his week with a bizarre phone interview on Fox Business in the course of which he referred to Vladimir Putin’s nuclear threats as “the n-word”, dismissed climate change as “a thing called weather”, and insisted he would continue running on the supposed theft of the 2020 election despite the host’s suggestion it could hurt Republicans at the polls. His excitable Monday morning comes after an event in Florida over the weekend during which he appeared to promise a return to the White House. Following his remarks, Republican US Rep Liz Cheney warned that the ex-president could face criminal penalties over attacks on the US Capitol on 6 January, 2021, telling NBC that the House select committee investigating the assault is considering whether to recommend criminal punishment for the “kind of supreme dereliction of duty that you saw with President Trump”.

Addressing the Business Roundtable’s CEO Quarterly Meeting, which included the bosses of General Motors, Apple and Amazon, Mr Biden concluded his remarks by saying: “Now is a time when things are shifting. We’re going to – there’s going to be a new world order out there, and we’ve got to lead it. And we’ve got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.” The phrase quickly began trending on Twitter, with commentators wasting no time in gloating over what they saw as the president’s presumably accidental invocation of a well-worn conspiracy theory claiming that an elite globalist cabal operating from the shadows is plotting to carve up the world and impose totalitarian rule. Joe Sommerlad reports. What is the ‘New World Order’ and why has Joe Biden caused uproar by mentioning it? 13:30 , Andrew Naughtie The launch of Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social was supposed to be a major event in social media, finally presenting conservatives with a place to gather where their speech wouldn’t be censored (although the site’s terms and conditions contain clauses banning various things). However, the app’s troubled launch has been followed by flaccid signups and engagement. And now, it is clear that the president himself has little or no inclination to join in; in fact, he has yet to post on Truth Social at all. Nathan Place has the story. Trump hasn’t posted on his own social media app since its launch 12:36 , Andrew Naughtie Mo Brooks, the Alabama Congressman who is struggling to retain Donald Trump’s endorsement in his Senate run, has picked up a new line of attack in his campaign, promising to “fire” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell if he’s elected. Mr McConnell has become one of Mr Trump’s most hated enemies, largely because he has refused to sign up to the lie that the 2020 election was stolen and declined to take the side of those trying to rewrite the history of the 2021 insurrection. Since Mr Trump called him a “disappointment” in a recent interview, Mr Brooks has also boasted of his participation in the rally that preceded the 6 January riot.

The clip speaks for itself, so take a look below. Giuliani says Trump threatened to blow up Russia’s churches in Putin call 12:05 , Andrew Naughtie One of the greatest hopes for those who want to see Donald Trump kept away from the presidency is that at least one of the multiple legal cases in which he’s embroiled will result in a criminal indictment and a guilty verdict. However, writing in The Atlantic, Paul Rosenzweig, who served as a senior counsel in the investigation that led to Bill Clinton’s impeachment, has another, less optimistic perspective: I don’t see it happening. Please don’t misunderstand; I am as convinced as anyone of the criminality of Trump’s conduct, and nothing would please me more than to see him get his deserved comeuppance. He should, and very well may, be indicted in one or more of these jurisdictions. And the civil suits against him may have legs. But years of experience prosecuting fraught political cases (and defending others) has taught me that the criminal law is a blunt tool for achieving justice and a poor means of resolving political issues. In my judgment, the chances that Trump will be convicted of any crime are slim to none. And though I am no political analyst, my guess is that a failure to convict will only embolden him and his followers. Read his full argument below. Donald Trump is probably not going to jail. This is a fact that will seem obvious to a lot of people, and absolutely impossible to accept for others. https://t.co/xfHzL9bcNq — McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) March 22, 2022 11:30 , Andrew Naughtie Ohio US Senate candidate Josh Mandel, who has run an extremely caustic right-wing campaign in a crowded primary field, has been roundly criticised for a literal face-off with another candidate at a debate last week.

Mr Mandel found himself being chastised by none other than Steve Bannon, who has a well-earned reputation for far-right incitement. “Keep the content as hot as you can.

In a video posted on Mr Kinzinger’s Twitter account, he expanded on that point further, saying that Mr Carlson’s “insistence that the west was provoking war with Putin, his spreading lies about biolabs, and his continued spewing of conspiracy theories are nothing but complete evil. His show is full of Russian propaganda and not news”. “And another one!” pic.twitter.com/fHXtWl0UKh — Adam Kinzinger (@AdamKinzinger) March 21, 2022 Mr Kinzinger is one of a few Republican politicians who are raising the alarms over the content aired on Mr Carlson’s nightly show. Last week, the 52-year-old TV host took to the airwaves to decry that Republican lawmaker Michael McCaul had slandered him by accusing him of spreading Russian disinformation on his show. There was no evidence provided by the Fox News host, but he alleged in his diatribe that the Texas congressman called Mr Carlson’s program “an organ of disinformation”. 10:00 , Andrew Naughtie Donald Trump is reportedly considering withdrawing his endorsement from Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks, a right-winger who spoke at Mr Trump’s “stop the steal” rally on 6 January but who has since said the GOP should start running on issues other than the supposed theft of the 2020 election.

The Republican leader hinted at support for the bill last month but on Monday vetoed it, stating that the legislation “falls short” of providing a consistent statewide policy for “fairness in K-12 sports”. Critics of the transgender sports bill argued it was a bigoted response to a problem that doesn’t exist, with the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana saying it planned a lawsuit against what it called “hateful legislation”. 07:17 , Alisha Rahaman Sarkar Congresswoman Liz Cheney has said that former president Donald Trump could face criminal penalties over the 6 January riots at the US Capitol.

The Trump justices have shifted the balance of the court significantly to the right.

He is not accused of entering the building. Noah Bookbinder, president of watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said Griffin “has used his public platform to spread the false narrative that the election was stolen from Donald Trump and to defend the attack on our Capitol,” and that “his actions on January 6th were part of and contributed to an insurrection, and his tenure in government continues to be a threat to our democracy.” “It’s time for Couy Griffin to be removed from office,” he said.

Pressed on whether the climate is changing because of human activity, he responded: In my opinion, you have a thing called weather and you go up and you go down. If you look into the 1920s they were talking about global freezing. Okay, in other words, if globe was going to freeze, and then they go global warming then they couldn’t use that because the temperatures were actually quite cool, and many different things so that now they just talk about climate change.

Much as Vladimir Putin alone holds much of the power to end the war in Ukraine, only the US really has the power to allow the American military to be investigated. One of the perks of being a superpower is you get to decide which rules apply to you. But if we want to live in a world where such arbitrary and hypocritical uses of power are a thing of the past — in Ukraine, Afghanistan, or anywhere else — Americans must move beyond half-hearted commitments to international justice.

3/24/2022,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Trevor Hunnicutt ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) -The Biden administration, seeking to deter China from aiding sanctions-hit Russia, on Wednesday warned Beijing not to take advantage of business opportunities created by sanctions, help Moscow evade export controls or process its banned financial transactions. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that G7 countries would soon announce a unified response to make sure Russia cannot evade Western sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine with the help of China or any other country. Speaking aboard Air Force One en route to Brussels where President Joe Biden will attend an emergency NATO summit, Sullivan said, ""That's not specifically about China, but it will apply to every significant economy and the decisions that any of those economies take to try, in an intentional and active way, to undermine or weaken the sanctions that we put in place."" He said the U.S. government has conveyed this message to China and that, ""We expect similar communication by European Union and individual European countries."" After Biden had a video call with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, Beijing condemned the sanctions on Russia. It said ""sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions would only make the people suffer"" and should not be ""further escalated."" U.S. export restrictions are intended to block Russian access to critical goods such as commercial electronics, computers and aircraft parts. Washington is concerned that China could help Russia ""backfill"" and access these products by violating trade restrictions. The U.S. government has tools to ensure that can't happen, Sullivan added. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Reuters on Wednesday that the United States would punish any companies that violate the export controls on goods like semiconductors. In terms of payments, Sullivan said, the United States and its G7 allies will respond to ""systematic efforts, industrial-scale efforts to try to reorient the settlement of financial payments."" China has not condemned Russia's action in Ukraine, though it has expressed deep concern about the war.
