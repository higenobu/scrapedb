2/22/2022,"The “first barrage of UK economic sanctions against Russia” will be announced on Tuesday, Boris Johnson said, as one of his senior cabinet ministers said the Russian “invasion of Ukraine has begun”. Speaking after a 6.30am Cobra meeting, Johnson said the Kremlin was bent on a “full-scale invasion of Ukraine” and said the UK’s sanctions would hit the “economic interests that have been supporting Russia’s war machine”, a suggestion the UK was prepared to continue ratcheting up measures.  “They will hit Russia very hard and there is a lot more that we are going to do in the event of an invasion. Be in no doubt that if Russian companies are prevented from raising capital on the UK financial markets, if we unpeel the facade of Russian ownership of companies, of property, it will start to hurt.” Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said he would agree that the threat posed by Russia’s action was on a par with the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. “It’s a violation of international law, and we and Nato will not accept it,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Johnson convened the 6.30am meeting as Vladimir Putin ordered troops over the Ukrainian border into territories in the east of the country, where Russian troops already have significant presence. A statement to MPs is expected later on Tuesday. Earlier, Putin had recognised what he termed the independence of Russia-controlled eastern Ukraine areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, in defiance of international agreements and ordered in forces under the guise of “peacekeeping”. Both the US and UK believe that the Russian entry into eastern Ukraine is a precursor for a more sweeping invasion, though the US has not yet used the term to describe the latest troop movements. The EU’s foreign affairs representative said the bloc did not consider a “fully fledged invasion” had occurred. But Javid took a stronger line on Tuesday morning, telling Sky News: “We have seen that he has recognised these breakaway eastern regions in Ukraine and from the reports we can already tell that he has sent in tanks and troops. From that you can conclude that the invasion of Ukraine has begun.” Overnight, Johnson spoke to the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, telling him he would explore sending further defensive support to Ukraine, at the request of the Ukrainian government. The Cobra meeting follows an emergency session of the UN security council where the UK’s ambassador, Dame Barbara Woodward, said Russia had “brought us to the brink”, warning that the country’s actions “will have severe and far-reaching consequences”. She said an invasion would unleash “the forces of war, death and destruction” on the people of Ukraine. “The humanitarian impact will be terrible on civilians fleeing the fighting. We know that women and children will suffer most.” She said the security council must be united in calling on Russia to “de-escalate immediately”, as well as “condemning aggression against a sovereign nation and defending the territorial integrity of Ukraine”. The EU’s foreign affairs high representative, Josep Borrell, will also convene an extraordinary meeting on Tuesday, in which EU foreign ministers will adopt sanctions against Russia over its recognition of Ukrainian separatist regions. “I’m sure there will be a unanimous decision”, he said. However, there are differences in opinion within the EU as to the strength of the package that will be imposed on Russia at this stage, with Borrell suggesting that Russia had not, as yet, launched a “fully fledged” invasion although its troops were on Ukrainian soil.",News/World news,Boris Johnson to announce ‘barrage of UK sanctions against Russia’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/boris-johnson-to-announce-barrage-of-uk-sanctions-against-russia
2/22/2022,"Perhaps it was the corner-shop setting that first drew Alfred Hitchcock’s attention to Charles Bennett’s Blackmail as the source of his 1929 film. Hitchcock had grown up above his family’s small shop in east London. He would have recognised the world of Bennett’s play, in which claustrophobic living “back stage” is combined with a whirl of local gossip “front of house” on the shop floor. Or perhaps Hitchcock was simply drawn by the huge success of the play. It had opened in the West End in 1928 with Tallulah Bankhead incongruously cast as a young, working-class Londoner. The response in London had been mixed. But once the play went on tour it was a sensation. Its frank portrayal of female sexuality, more than a dash of male homosexuality and a questioning of the probity of the justice system drew audiences across the country. By the end of the year, multiple companies were touring the play.  Its first act is a sensational melodrama. But in the second and third, it shifts into a different genre: the thriller. Driven by suspense rather than shock, those final two acts invent the ground rules for much of the work that Bennett and Hitchcock were to make for the rest of their lives. The duo first planned Blackmail as a silent film. But sound equipment arrived at the studio during filming in 1929. Hitchcock – always fascinated by new technology – reshot some scenes to produce the UK’s first full-length “talkie” which became an even bigger hit than the original play. Hitchcock and Bennett carried on working together on the British films The Man Who Knew Too Much and The Thirty-Nine Steps, creating the template for the “wrongly accused man on the run” story. Hitchcock returned to that template at the height of his Hollywood success with North by Northwest, which reutilises the device of a climactic chase at a national monument he first invented with Bennett for Blackmail. When the producer Simon Friend invited me to revisit and revise Bennett’s play for a new production, I decided to cut the first melodramatic act. Bennett wrote a first draft of Blackmail while working as a young actor in 1924. I reasoned that if he himself had returned to the play, it’s a cut he would have considered. Confining the action to a room behind the shop – as his second and third acts do – and revealing earlier events with a series of revelations, creates the boilerhouse of secrets and lies that make an effective thriller. One of the great challenges of the genre is to write the characters into a corner from which there seems no possible escape. The playwright then has to invent a reversal in the last few minutes which suddenly provides an opportunity for escape that neither the characters nor the audience could have anticipated. It’s a tough call. Bennett’s drafts reveal that he had several goes at an ending, none of which he found entirely satisfying. For my new version, I’ve taken one of his possible endings, developing and amplifying it to create – I hope – a satisfying but not-too-neat ending with a moral ambiguity that leaves the audience with some big questions about the events they’ve just witnessed. Bennett was at work on an unproduced screenplay of a new version of Blackmail when he died in 1995. Working from drafts and notes provided by his estate, I’ve come up with a new version which I hope honours his status as the inventor of the modern thriller. Blackmail is at the Mercury theatre, Colchester, 4-19 March.",Arts/Stage,Mark Ravenhill on Blackmail: the sensational thriller that shook Hitchcock and me,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/22/mark-ravenhill-on-blackmail-hitchcock-charles-bennett
2/22/2022,"“Ihad started on a voyage of discovery, only to find that it was I who was being discovered,” writes Tété-Michel Kpomassie in this memoir of his time as “an African in Greenland”, first published in 1981 and now reissued by Penguin Modern Classics in a translation by James Kirkup. His discovery begins, as many do, in a book. As a teenager in 1950s Togo, one of Africa’s smallest countries, he finds The Eskimos from Greenland to Alaska, stocked by accident in an evangelical bookshop. The world of “the little men of the north” seems exotic to a boy brought up in a country where a python was wound around his naked body to cure a head injury. “In that land of ice, at least, there would be no snakes!” He returns to the bookshop to buy a map of the world.  Kpomassie is a young man of resourcefulness and energy. He feels “the call of the cold” in 1958, aged 17, and spends years working his way up the west coast of Africa, country by country, bouncing off obstacles like a pinball. In 1963, he makes it to Marseille; he feels “freer in France than on African soil”, because residents of former colonies are made welcome, but also because he is at last alone in a new world. Two years later, he makes it to the “eternal ice” of his destination, a different planet 4,500 miles from home. He, too, is like an alien to the Greenlanders: “As soon as they saw me, all talking stopped.” But they like this curious stranger and one girl names him “Michel the Giant”: at 5ft 11in, he is 8in taller than most locals. As Kpomassie throws himself into life in Greenland, he finds his height is not the only thing on a different scale. Greenland’s only prison has six cells. He goes fishing in the “international port” of Færingehavn, population 13. And he is maddened by their nonchalance, where a direct question nearly always produces the answer “Immaqa!” (“Perhaps!”) But like many tourists, he has exoticised the country and is disappointed by ordinary life. “I wanted to live with seal hunters, ride in a sledge, sleep in an igloo!” So he travels to the far north, to experience the endless nights of winter and the nightless days of spring. Even difficulties are described with relish: Kpomassie reports only one incident of racial abuse, which he (perhaps vaingloriously) attributes to the man’s envy of his success with local women. Darkness, figurative and literal, becomes more common: we learn of “polar hysteria”, where a man leaves his home to beat up strangers, and of the symbiotic relationship between humans and dogs, not just as companions but as food. A poverty-stricken man slaughters his dogs one by one to feed his family; when permafrost is too hard for burial, huskies break coffins open and “gorge themselves on human flesh”. Once, Kpomassie is attacked by a ravenous dog and is saved from injury, aptly, by his thick dogskin trousers. Dogs and men come together when seal blubber is on the menu: Kpomassie finds it “nauseating” – and seal intestines take “a lot of chewing” – but he soon comes to enjoy the food. It’s a measure of his increasing happiness in Greenland, though he leaves after 18 months to return home and try to explain things such as snow to his family. “Imagine that all the white birds in the sky are shedding their feathers…” Michel the Giant is as much an ebullient snapshot of a vanished age as a travel book. In a new afterword, mostly an inessential account of the book’s success, Kpomassie makes clear that Greenland is his enduring love. He has gone back several times and now, he says, at the age of 81 he will return this year, for the final time, to live out his days in the home where his heart resides.

2/22/2022,"HSBC boosted its banker bonus pool by nearly a third after a global recovery from the Covid crisis helped profits more than double last year. The London-headquartered bank increased its staff bonus pool to $3.5bn (£2.6bn), a move it said was justified due to its strong financial performance and the need to compete for bankers in an “extraordinarily competitive labour market”.  “It is critical for our long-term performance that we continue to attract and retain the talent necessary to deliver our strategic priorities,” HSBC said in its annual report on Tuesday. The boost to bonuses came as the bank said it had paid its bankers 451 of its bankers €1m (£832,000) or more last year, marking a 40% increase on the number of staff with such payouts. That list included 15 bankers earning more than €5m, including one unnamed banker who was handed €11-12m – nearly double the £4.9m paid to the HSBC chief executive, Noel Quinn. Quinn’s pay increased by 18% after the cash bonus he waived during the first year of the Covid crisis in 2020 was reinstated. It came as HSBC reported a surge in its annual pretax profits, which rose from $8.8bn to $19bn. The increase was primarily driven by improving economic conditions, which allowed it to release hundreds of millions of pounds originally set aside for a potential jump in loan defaults during the pandemic. The bank released around $928m in loan loss provisions for the year. It is a significant improvement compared with the $8.8bn it was forced to put aside in fear of soured debts in 2020. Quinn said the bank had ended the year on a high note, recording profits in all of its regional businesses including the UK. However, he said the bank’s leadership “remain cognisant of the potential impact that further Covid-19-related uncertainty and continued inflation might have on us and our clients”.

2/22/2022,"A police officer involved in the attempt to arrest Kumanjayi Walker before his death has told a court he was “surprised” other officers had not used their guns when the Warlpiri man threatened them with an axe during a seperate incident days earlier. Remote Sgt Adam Eberl was the other officer in the room when Constable Zachary Rolfe shot dead Walker on 9 November 2019 in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs.  On Tuesday, Eberl started his evidence in Rolfe’s murder trial in the Northern Territory supreme court. He said that on the day of the shooting, when he, Rolfe, and two other officers were preparing to depart Alice Springs, the group watched footage of a previous incident involving Walker which had occurred on 6 November 2019. During that incident, Walker rushed at two Yuendumu-based officers with a small axe. The court has previously heard this incident was one of several factors that led to the Yuendumu deployment of Rolfe and the other officers from the Immediate Response Team (IRT), which had been trained to arrest dangerous targets. Eberl said that, after watching the footage, he remarked to the other officers he was surprised the two local police who had been threatened with the axe had not used their firearm. Later in his evidence, he clarified that “I said, ‘Wow, I’m surprised they didn’t use the firearm’.” Eberl said he was not angry at what had occurred during the axe incident. He could not recall Rolfe making any comment about it, or mentioning what he would do if threatened with a weapon by Walker. On Tuesday, the court was again shown footage from Eberl’s body-worn camera of the moments immediately before the shooting. It shows Eberl and Rolfe entering a property known as House 511 at about 7.20pm. Eberl agreed he suspected Walker was inside, because of information police had been given by community members only minutes earlier, but said he and Rolfe had not had any discussion about what they would do if Walker confronted them with a weapon. Eberl described the lighting in House 511 as very poor, and said he switched on his torch. Soon after the officers entered they saw Walker walking towards them. Eberl was asked a series of questions by Philip Strickland SC, the crown prosecutor, about his recollections of these moments immediately before the shooting. Eberl told the court he noticed Walker was trying to walk past the officers, but he did not notice him putting his hands in his pockets. He agreed he had been trained to ask suspects to show them their hands, but that he did not do it on this occasion, and that he had been trained that weapons could be hidden in hats. Eberl said that at this time he did not consider Walker to be dangerous, did not consider withdrawing from the house and setting a cordon or the need to put distance between himself or Walker, and did not consider grabbing Walker by an arm or both arms or the need to gain physical control of him. The officers were about 2m from the only door to the property when they came across Walker, Eberl said. Strickland told the court in the prosecution opening earlier this month that soon after the officers confronted Walker, he stabbed Rolfe with a pair of scissors. Eberl has not yet given evidence about the critical moments in which Rolfe shot Walker, and his evidence is expected to continue on Wednesday. Strickland says Rolfe then shot Walker once while he and Eberl were standing about a metre away. This shot is not subject to any charges. Prosecutors say Walker then fell or was wrestled to the ground by Eberl, and the pair struggled on a mattress which was on the floor of House 511. The prosecution alleges Rolfe then walked across the room to the pair, placed his left hand on Eberl’s back, extended his right hand until the barrel of his handgun was within 15cm of Walker’s body, and pulled the trigger twice more. It is the second and third shots which are subject to the murder charge. Rolfe has pleaded not guilty, with one of his barristers, David Edwardson QC, saying the officer acted within his training as he feared for his safety and that of Eberl when he fired the shots. Strickland has previously told the court the prosecution alleges Eberl, a larger man than Walker, was in control of him at the time Rolfe fired the second and third shots, a claim that the defence disputes. Eberl was not questioned on Tuesday about wrestling with Walker, but gave evidence that he had more than a decade of experience in a variety of martial arts disciplines including jujitsu, kung fu and aikido, that he was 184cm tall, and that at the time of the shooting he weighed about 95kg.",News/Australia news,Zachary Rolfe trial: other officer present when Kumanjayi Walker was shot begins evidence,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/zachary-rolfe-trial-other-officer-present-when-kumanjayi-walker-was-shot-begins-evidence
