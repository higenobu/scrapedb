3/15/2022,"Down on the bench, Jordi Alba leaned towards to Ronald Araújo, said something cheeky and grinned. At which point, the Uruguayan, a little slow to click at first, went from huh?! to a line of his own and both of them started laughing. They covered their mouths so you couldn’t work out what it actually was but it was more fun to guess anyway, a kind of Camp Nou caption competition. Something like: “And then he only goes and says: ‘surely love is a kind of blackmail,’” perhaps. Or: “Should have gone to Spurs.” They had just gone into the 92nd minute of Sunday’s game and Barcelona were leading Osasuna 4-0. Alba had been withdrawn, invited to enjoy the rest the night off. To his left were Gerard Piqué and Ferrán Torres, their work here done, much like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Pedri who sat in the shadows of the second row. Alongside them, Adama Traoré, Araújo and the two De Jongs hadn’t been needed but they will be. For now, they had to sit it out and watch. Alba had turned to Araújo at exactly the moment Ousmane Dembélé had escaped up the right again. This time the Frenchman’s cross fell short, but they could laugh: the game was won and Dembélé had already created two goals for the second time in 14 days. In four league matches, he had as many assists as in the previous f45. Only two players, Karim Benzema and Óscar Trejo, have more in the league. And Dembélé has startedonly seven games. He wasn’t supposed to start any more. It was 53 days since he had been handed an ultimatum: renew your contract or leave now. Or, y’know, don’t. As negotiations fell apart – Barcelona unable to reach agreement with a player their president claimed was “better than Mbappé” – Xavi Hernández had warned that leaving someone in the stands wasn’t a good look. It was not something he was “contemplating,” he said, but he had little choice. And when the ultimatum was delivered, a decision taken by club not coach, he knew it could prove impossible to impose. Dembélé, he conceded, is the one “holding the frying pan by the handle”. Not least because they needed him to sign or go in order to register others. Dembélé said he wasn’t the kind of man who gives in to blackmail. “And surely love is a kind of blackmail,” he wrote but there wasn’t much love left, if there ever really had been. For too many of his four years in Spain he had been almost irrelevant; now his time was going to end the way it played out, watching others play, or so it goes. Barcelona left him out of the squad for the next game in the cup, which might have meant there wasn’t a next game in the cup: in his absence, Barcelona were eliminated by Athletic Club. They kept pushing him towards the door, desperately seeking a solution right to the end. You name a club, they named a club. They signed people to play in his position. They tried to make him go to Spurs. But Dembélé wasn’t moving. And so, in the end, they did. When the window closed and Dembélé was still there, the threat became worthless. “We have to be intelligent, leave egos to one side and make the most of Ousmane,” Dani Alves said. “A solution hasn’t been found; he’s part of the squad and he has a contract,” the coach insisted, convincing the club of that. “We can’t shoot ourselves in the foot.” Twenty-three days after being told to leave, Dembélé ran on away at city rivals Espanyol – which was one way of ensuring he didn’t get such a hostile reception on his return. Before Dembélé reappeared at the Camp Nou four days later, Xavi asked fans not to whistle him but they did it anyway. “They didn’t take any notice of me,” the coach said, but actually some probably had: their anger and rejection was expressed briefly and extremely loudly, a statement made, but they were here to support the team it not necessarily him, and so they moved on. So did he, acting as if nothing had happened, which is how he acts often, passivity apparently is part of him. He just went to train and played games, and did very well. “He’s been a good professional, his behaviour is irreproachable: I have no complaints,” Xavi said. “I’m pleased for him because it hasn’t been an easy situation, but I always said he could be the best in the world in his position. As a club I think we were intelligent and we have to make the most of him because he is a talent.” When he had replied to Barcelona’s “blackmail” Dembélé had said his days of ignoring the things said about him were over, declaring four years of silence “finished”, and then immediately went silent again. He scored a belter against Athletic, the ball rocketing into the net, but there was no finger in the ear or on the lip, no now what?! The assists followed and there was no vindication or redemption song, not a word. Perhaps more importantly, there were no injuries, at least not yet. Barcelona have played four league games since Espanyol and won them all; in three, they have scored four goals, the whistles fading away. You can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all the time but cannot fool all of the people all of the time. As for the Camp Nou people, you can’t fool them at all, Xavi said. Which was kind of ironic – Lord knows, Barcelona boards have tried – but this time it was right. “If you perform you make people happy: they see how he works, how he gives his life for Barcelona,” the coach said last night. “He made chances, passed, gave assists. There’s no debate now.” Not that it is only Dembélé, Xavi rightly starting to list the rest when the focus fell on the Frenchman on Sunday night. The league game before his return, Barcelona also scored four after all, against Atlético. They’re unbeaten in 12, and have won six of their last seven. A league table since Xavi took over from Ronald Koeman would have them second, two points behind Madrid, having lost a solitary game. The 2022 table would have them top. The actual table has them third, closing on Sevilla. Asked if they would win the league, Xavi replied: “quite honestly, it’s very difficult. Even if we did win at the Bernabéu, Madrid would still have to drop points three or four times so we can’t be very optimistic.” Not about that, no, but when it comes to it there are reasons to be cheerful, with Osasuna manager Jagoba Arrasate saying: “they’re developing an idea and the mechanics are better. They have more punch up front than the team we faced earlier in the season.” Atlético Madrid 2-1 Cadiz; Barcelona 4-0 Osasuna; Getafe 0-0 Valencia; Granada 0-1 Elche; Levante 1-1 Espanyol; Rayo Vallecano 1-1 Sevilla; Real Betis 1-0 Athletic Bilbao; Real Sociedad 1-0 Alavés; Villarreal 1-0 Celta Vigo Monday Mallorca v Real Madrid (8pm GMT) Traoré has provided more assists in 21 minutes than 20 games at Wolves. By his fifth game he had more than in the previous 73. Ferran Torres has five goals, two coming on Sunday just as doubts emerged about his finishing. Aubameyang has six. “He’s a gift from heaven,” Xavi said. Dani Alves is six weeks from his 39th birthday and flying. Sergio Busquets and Piqué aren’t finished. Nor is Alba. When it comes to talent, Pedri is the best in the world Xavi says, a footballer who “reminds me of Andrés Iniesta”. Gavi plays with his laces undone, but he’s “a wonder”, the Barcelona coach insisting: “he amazes me.” There is more, or at least there was on Sunday night. Leading 3-0 after half an hour, Barcelona could make changes, resting players ahead of a week when they go to Turkey and the Bernabéu. Walking in: Memphis, who has 10 goals; Riqui Puig who hadn’t played a minute in La Liga in 2022 and scored his first for 14 months; Clément Lenglet, who hadn’t started this year; Óscar Mingueza, who had started just once; even Martin Braithwaite appearing in the league for the first time since August. It was all almost too perfect, too good to be true. And so it proved. Just when it looked like things might actually turn out all right, they looked so wrong again, Barcelona were not even given 12 hours to enjoy the perfect evening. On Sunday night they scored four, taking their 19th point from the last 21, but by Monday lunchtime there were more worrying numbers put before them, reality returning to the surface when La Liga revealed the estimated salary limits for every club. Barcelona’s is minus €144m, the only club in the red.On Sunday night, Jordi Cruyff was asked if after all that Dembélé could even end up staying. “Hmm,” he said. “I think what matters is that when he plays he gives everything; we still can’t control the rest.”",Sport/Football,"Barça buoyant again thanks to Ousmane Dembélé, the man who wouldn’t move | Sid Lowe",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/14/barcelona-are-buoyant-again-thanks-to-dembele-the-man-who-wouldnt-move
3/15/2022,"On the night Boris Johnson finally threw his lot in with the Brexiters, naturally only his nearest and dearest were privy to his thoughts. His then wife, Marina Wheeler, was there, plus the leading leaver Michael Gove and his then wife, Sarah Vine. The odd one out over a supper of slow-roasted lamb at Johnson and Wheeler’s Islington home, meanwhile, was Evgeny Lebedev. The millionaire son of a former Russian KGB officer apparently hung out with the wives making “polite conversation in stage whispers” while Johnson and Gove talked by speakerphone to a fellow cabinet minister who was trying vainly to persuade them to back remain. Vine did not explain, in her subsequent newspaper column describing the evening, why Lebedev was playing gooseberry on such a momentous and sensitive night for the nation’s future. If the presence of the Evening Standard and Independent proprietor surprised her, however, she didn’t say so. For a famously shy man, Lebedev certainly gets around. Here he is with Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen, photographed for the annual Evening Standard theatre awards (at which, the Guardian’s veteran awards-coverer Hadley Freeman points out, winners would invariably thank “darling Evgeny” and mention his “beautiful house in Tuscany”). Here he is handing the Standard editorship to George Osborne, an ousted chancellor in need of a job but not noticeably a journalist. Here he is photographed with Prince William, with Peter Mandelson, with Tony Blair, with Elton John. And here he is hosting what Johnson’s biographer, Tom Bower, called bacchanalian weekends in his castle in Italy every summer, where Johnson could apparently behave “like a naughty schoolboy”. There are no photographs of those, of course; just reports of an unkempt Johnson the morning after one of them looking (according to a fellow passenger at the airport) like he’d slept in his clothes. Johnson was foreign secretary at the time. But those were the days when Russian money was coursing through London’s veins – supporting the arts, bailing out football clubs, filling hedge funds and keeping Chelsea builders busy excavating mega-basements – and asking where it came from was deemed horribly unsophisticated. Back then, Putin and the endless photographs of him stripped to the waist were treated almost as a joke. So London became the site of a kind of giant cultural exchange, where billionaires could trade money for class, for access, for feeling at the very heart of things. The journalist Camilla Long, who was working for Tatler magazine when it co-hosted a characteristically lavish, star-studded party with Lebedev’s father, Alexander, at the Earl of Spencer’s Althorp estate, remembers his son as “the oligarch it’s OK to be friends with”. Socialising with them might have felt a little risque, but excitingly so. Besides, most other sources of cash around – fossil fuel companies anxious to greenwash their reputations by sponsoring art galleries, or Saudi princes keen to buy football clubs – were morally compromised. If cool Britannia were to keep up appearances then the money had to come from somewhere, didn’t it? What the last few weeks have exposed, however, is how closely the British establishment resembles an aristocratic family on its uppers: all fur coat and no knickers, still clinging to the stately home but with no money to fix the leaking roof, and in no position to be choosy. That apparently starts at the top, judging by the current internal investigation into allegations that major donors to Prince Charles’s charity secured meetings with the future king in return for their generosity. But any institution whose cachet dwarfs its bank balance is potentially in the same boat, a category embracing both main political parties and the media. Newspapers still confer clout, prestige and access to the heart of power but increasingly struggle to turn a profit, leaving titles such as the Standard and the Independent unable to refuse a generous offer. “What I do find extraordinary,” Sasha Swire wrote in her 2020 memoir, Diary of an MP’s Wife, after meeting Lebedev at Chequers during David Cameron’s time in office, “is how he has managed to penetrate the very core of the English political establishment by buying a newspaper.” It was through the Standard that he first got close to Johnson, then mayor of London. The two men had been friends for a decade by the time British intelligence services allegedly warned against giving Lebedev a peerage on security grounds; years of texting, lunching and partying in the Umbrian hills. Johnson reportedly brushed off warnings about his confidant, just as he habitually rejects anything that sounds killjoy-ish or obstructive of his freedom to do what he likes. When he entered Downing Street, he reportedly insisted on Lebedev getting that peerage – and after further evidence was provided, the security services are said to have “reframed” their advice, allowing it to go through. Duly elevated in November 2020, Lord Lebedev of Hampton and Siberia has not contributed to a debate or cast a vote since. Presumably he could always pick up the phone, if he ever wanted to express a view. Some will wonder why any of this matters, given Lebedev this week publicly denied being an “agent of Russia” and has stated his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. It is hardly a crime to be a lover of the arts, pro-Brexit, or to want – as many rich men do – to seek his entree to an establishment happy to accommodate him. As his old friend Gove told Sky News, we must of course beware crude anti-Russian prejudice at a time when many ordinary Russian émigrés in Britain are appalled by Putin’s actions, and scared stiff their children are going to be bullied at school because of it. It’s just that this prime minister of all prime ministers is perhaps the last one you’d trust to take a sensibly precautionary approach to a millionaire – any millionaire – offering a lift on a private jet. According to his former aide Dominic Cummings, this is a man who sought money from private donors for the renovation of his flat, despite warnings that might be illegal, and was allegedly so blase about national security that he left highly classified papers lying around his flat. It’s highly unlikely any passing visitor ever sneaked a look, of course, but that doesn’t make it right. The trouble with men who never seem to think the rules apply to them is that all too often, they turn out to be precisely the men for whom those rules exist.

3/15/2022,"Facebook and Instagram users are not allowed to call for the death of Vladimir Putin, according to an update issued by their parent company. Meta had issued new guidance on Friday allowing content that condoned the harm of Russian soldiers, with media reporting at the time that it also permitted content urging violence against the Russian president. However, Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, has clarified the rules on posts, stating that “calls for the death of a head of state” are banned. Clegg said in an internal post to staff on Sunday, first reported by Bloomberg, that the new moderation rule “is never to be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general”. He added: “We also do not permit calls to assassinate a head of state.” Reuters reported last week that calls for the death of Putin, and his Belarusian counterpart and ally Alexander Lukashenko, would be allowed on Meta platforms in a limited number of countries, unless they contained other targets or have two indicators of credibility, such as the location or method. The posts would be permitted in countries in eastern Europe and the Caucasus including Russia, Ukraine, Georgia and Poland, according to internal emails to Meta’s content moderators, Reuters said. However, Clegg added in the internal post on Sunday that the revised policy allowing threats of violence against the Russian military only applied in Ukraine, and “only in the context of speech regarding the Russian military invasion of Ukraine”. Despite the clarification, Russia took down the Instagram platform on Monday, cutting off 80 million users from the service. It banned Facebook on 4 March. Last week Russia’s general prosecutor’s office said it had moved to recognise Meta as an “extremist organisation and ban its activities on the territory of Russia”. A statement by the Russian communications regulator confirming the Instagram sanction did not refer to Meta’s other large platform, the WhatsApp messaging service. The Russian news agency RIA Novosti has reported that WhatsApp will not be banned. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, said on Friday that the ban was “wrong” and would cut off millions of people from access to the world. On Monday, Instagram will be blocked in Russia. This decision will cut 80 million in Russia off from one another, and from the rest of the world as ~80% of people in Russia follow an Instagram account outside their country. This is wrong. Meta has blocked content from the Russia state news services Russia Today and Sputnik in the UK, the EU and Ukraine, while YouTube is blocking access to Russian state media channels globally.",News/Technology,Facebook and Instagram users not allowed to call for death of Putin,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/14/facebook-instagram-death-putin-meta
3/15/2022,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, will address Congress on Wednesday in what could prove his most powerful plea yet for the west to take a tougher line against Vladimir Putin. Zelenskiy is expected to use the virtual address to urge members of the House of Representatives and Senate to intensify pressure on Joe Biden to allow the transfer of MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a joint letter to members: “The Congress, our country and the world are in awe of the people of Ukraine, who have shown extraordinary courage, resilience and determination in the face of Russia’s unprovoked, vicious and illegal war.” They added: “The Congress remains unwavering in our commitment to supporting Ukraine as they face Putin’s cruel and diabolical aggression, and to passing legislation to cripple and isolate the Russian economy as well as deliver humanitarian, security and economic assistance to Ukraine. “We look forward to the privilege of welcoming President Zelenskiy’s address to the House and Senate and to convey our support to the people of Ukraine as they bravely defend democracy.” Zelenskiy, who will speak at 9am Washington time on Wednesday, has been seeking to drum up support with video briefings of foreign audiences. Last week he received a standing ovation from the British parliament and echoed William Shakespeare (“The question for us now is: ‘To be or not to be’”) and Winston Churchill (“We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets”). On Tuesday, the TV actor and comedian turned resistance leader, who has proved adept at communications under siege, is scheduled to address the Canadian parliament in Ottawa. He is also due to speak to Israel’s parliament at some stage. On 5 March, dressed in a military-green T-shirt and seated beside a Ukrainian flag, Zelenskiy spoke to more than 280 members of the House and Senate in a video call. He is said to have made a “desperate plea” for aircraft to fight Russian invaders. Most members of Congress back the White House’s refusal to attempt to impose a “no-fly zone” that could entail US pilots firing on Russians and trigger a wider conflict. Chris Murphy, chairman of the Senate appropriations homeland security subcommittee, told the Hill: “This is the most dangerous moment since the Cuban missile crisis. We have never been this close to direct conflict with Russia. “We made the right decision to openly support the Ukrainians but we just should understand the unprecedented moment that we’re living in today where we’re openly funding war against a nuclear power.” But there is a growing split over Poland’s offer to send Soviet-style MiG-29 fighter jets, which Ukrainian pilots are capable of flying, to Ukraine via a US airbase in Germany. The White House and Pentagon have rejected the proposal, wary that an increasingly reckless Putin could perceive it as escalatory and saying it raised “serious concerns” for the entire Nato alliance. Republicans and some Democrats say Zelenskiy’s request should be met. Mitt Romney, a Republican senator from Utah, said last week: “He has asked us for aircraft – specifically MiGs. We need to get him those MiGs. It is a bipartisan message.” Rob Portman, a Republican senator from Ohio visiting the Ukraine-Poland border, told CNN: “What we’ve heard directly from the Ukrainians is they want them badly. They want the ability to have better control over the skies in order to give them a fighting chance. I don’t understand why we’re not doing it.” The Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar, from Minnesota, was also on the visit. She said she had spoken to Biden “about 10 days ago” about the fighters, adding: “I’d like to see the planes over there.” The Democratic-controlled Congress approved $13.6bn in humanitarian and security aid to Ukraine last Thursday, as part of a $1.5tn spending bill that funds US government operations through 30 September. The US and allies have imposed broad sanctions on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Biden has announced a US ban on Russian oil imports, seen as politically risky amid soaring gas prices. Last Friday the president took more steps to punish Russia economically, targeting trade and shutting down development funds while announcing a ban on imports of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds. On Saturday he authorised $200m in additional military equipment for Ukraine. About 59% of Americans believe Biden has been making the right decisions when it comes to the situation in Ukraine, including more than one in three Republicans, according to Navigator Research. However, asked whether they approve of Biden’s handling of the issue, Americans are more polarised, with 49% disapproving and 43% approving. Biden’s predecessor as president, Donald Trump, again refused to condemn Putin at a rally in South Carolina on Saturday. “It happens to be a man that is just driven, he’s driven to put it together,” Trump said, while claiming the war would never have happened if he was still in the White House. On Monday a fourth round of talks between Ukraine and Russia were held via videoconference amid deadly air strikes in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. At the weekend, Russian airstrikes killed 35 people at a military base near Yavoriv, outside Lviv – perilously close to the frontier with Poland, a Nato member. In a video address, Zelenskiy warned: “If you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory, on Nato territory, on the homes of Nato citizens.” He urged Nato to impose a no-fly zone – a request he is likely to repeat to Congress on Wednesday.",News/World news,Volodymyr Zelenskiy expected to urge jet transfer in address to US Congress,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/volodymyr-zelenskiy-us-congress-address-mig-jets
3/15/2022,"Gaby Hinsliff’s conclusions on Westminster bullying are well-founded (Let the humiliation of John Bercow be a warning to bullying bosses everywhere, 10 March). Part of the explanation for this malignancy is that we tend to consider the few visible cases as exceptional rather than indicative. But while the reported behaviour of Dominic Cummings, Priti Patel or John Bercow may represent the higher-octane levels of outrageous conduct, it is hardly the case that lacerating tirades are rare in Westminster. In my brief stint as a parliamentary researcher I witnessed displays of unconstrained thuggery by some MPs towards their subordinates that certainly would not have been tolerated in any other branch of public service. It would also have appalled the public, who are used to seeing only the urbane, polished versions of these MPs on television. It was perfectly clear and wholly understood that, for some, party affiliations and personal ambition required these brutal tantrums to be endured as an occupational hazard. Such tolerance has three pernicious effects: lowering of the bar for what is permissible; encouraging a perception that abuse is the consequence merely of passion and perfectionism; and imagining that an elevated position should offer indemnity against sanction for behaviour for which the less exalted would be dismissed. Hinsliff is, of course, right to point to the heavy obligation that rests with the workplace “that makes the rules for everyone else”, but institutional cultures have long histories and deep roots, and their dismantling always has as many defenders as disruptors. That is why they endure despite good sense, public incredulity or common decency.Paul McGilchristColchester, Essex  Workplace bullying – which can be sideways between workers, upwards from workers to supervisors, or downwards from supervisors to workers – is rampant in many organisations. In the absence of clear policies against this, ideas about what is workplace bullying remain arbitrary and subjective. Employers should implement clear policies on this and raise awareness at all levels. People who are hurt are prone to hurting others and creating a negative work environment. Organisations should consider pre-employment psychological screening to identify people with personality disorders, while ensuring that the screening is not used to discriminate against vulnerable people, but to protect others from the harmful effects of unaddressed psychological issues.Mariam KhanLahore, Pakistan  Gaby Hinsliff does not mention Priti Patel’s history of bullying and harassment in three separate ministries. Protected by Boris Johnson’s instructions for MPs to “form a square around the Prittster”, Patel has somehow remained home secretary, while Bercow is ritually humiliated for seemingly the same (and, yes, inexcusable) offence.

3/15/2022,"As New Zealand celebrated a national holiday, one of the country’s largest city libraries was closed, with staff and security given the day off. But an error with the automated door programming meant Tūranga’s doors opened to the public as usual – and the unstaffed and unsecured library was happily used by the public, who browsed and checked out books for hours before someone realised the mistake. As well as its books, the library is home to a wide variety of artworks and sculpture – but staff say nothing was stolen, and there were no serious incidents to report. News of the incident emerged in correspondence documents released by the council last week. A library staff member at Christchurch city council said 380 people came into the building that Sunday morning. “Our self-issue machines automatically started up and 147 books were issued by customers. No book-theft alarms went off, and at this stage nothing has been reported missing, nor have we spotted any damage.” The library was supposed to be closed for Waitangi Day, a national holiday. There was one disgruntled punter – a person who couldn’t find a librarian to assist with checking out their CDs. The staffer wrote: “One customer left a note saying they were taking some CDs because there were no librarians in sight: ‘I’ve decided to take the CDs to teach you a lesson in how not to operate a functioning library.’ The returns room was full of books and the first floor … was quite messy. My team leaders will continue to check for any missing books or other items of value.” “Lucky nothing was stolen,” another staff member wrote. The council realised what was happening after seeing comments on the library’s lack of staff on social media, and a security guard was sent to usher out the city’s browsers. “We’re grateful for the honesty of the people who used the library during this time,” said Bruce Rendall, the head of facilities, property and planning at Christchurch city council. He said there had been an investigation and the door system failing was “very rare”. “We consider all of the materials in Tūranga to be valuable because of the knowledge, ideas and joy they bring people,” he said. “To the best of our knowledge, nothing has been taken. The people who accessed the library during this time used the self-checkout machines to issue books and other materials.” Facilities managers said in correspondence that the contractors in charge of the security door system “take responsibility” for the error and had “put in place a peer review for holiday programming to ensure this won’t happen again”.",News/World news,"‘Nothing was stolen’: New Zealanders carry on borrowing from closed, unstaffed library",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/nothing-was-stolen-new-zealanders-carry-on-borrowing-from-closed-unstaffed-library
3/15/2022,"Honeysuckle delivered the best performance of her career to win last year’s Champion Hurdle and there is no reason to suspect any of the also-rans 12 months ago can narrow the gap this time. Appreciate It and Teahupoo, by contrast, are fresh opponents for Honeysuckle with considerable scope for improvement. The time of Teahupoo’s recent Grade Three win at Gowran Park suggests the form is stronger than it might have looked. Honeysuckle (3.30), though, still has something to spare on form and gets the 7lb mares’ allowance too. The odds are short, but a win under Rachael Blackmore to elevate her further among the hurdling greats will be something to savour. 1.30 The “big three” in the market are unbeaten in seven starts over hurdles and closely matched on form and ratings. Dysart Dynamo’s winning time at Punchestown in January suggests the Irish form could be strongest and he gets the nod at around 5-2. 2.10 Edwardstone has been impressively consistent but he has little in hand on Timeform’s ratings and looks too short at 11-4. Haut En Couleurs (8-1) lacks his experience, which is a concern, but the market gave him a similar chance to stable companion Blue Lord before his fall at Leopardstown last time and his winning form on debut is rock-solid. 2.50 Our Power ran into traffic problems at a vital stage at Kempton last time, but removed any doubts about his stamina for this three-mile trip when staying on well to finish within eight lengths of the winner.

3/15/2022,"Ollie Robinson is poised to make his England return in Wednesday’s second Test against West Indies in Barbados – on what is another pitch shorn of any grass – provided he gets through one last training session unscathed. The 28-year-old missed last week’s drawn series opener in Antigua with a recurrence of the back spasms that dogged the back end of his Ashes tour but looked clear of the issue during yesterday’s voluntary training session at the Kensington Oval. A lengthy spell bowling out in the middle will still need to be repeated by Robinson on Tuesday before a final decision is made. But with Mark Wood out of the match due to an elbow injury – and awaiting scan results that will dictate his continuation on tour – at least one change to Joe Root’s attack is on the cards. That said, this proposed comeback for Robinson and the expectation of a true batting surface leaves England wondering whether Root has enough variety at his disposal. As such, it could be that Saqib Mahmood is handed a Test debut, adding slippery, slingy pace plus reverse swing if conditions allow. It would then be a choice between Chris Woakes and Craig Overton as to who makes way, with both struggling for any threat last week. The latter’s similarly to Robinson in terms of stature and release point – both are 6ft 5in – may see Woakes offered one last chance to address his ailing overseas record. Mahmood looked sharp during a session that also featured the heartening sight of Jofra Archer bowling briskly. Approaching a year since his last England appearance due to recurrent elbow stress fractures, Archer has linked up with the squad to continue his rehabilitation with an eye on a summer return. While England trained out in the middle, Andrew Strauss, interim managing director, provided an update on his search for a permanent successor and the first steps of a review into the English game prompted by the winter’s 4-0 Ashes debacle. Speaking on the day the role of managing director of England men’s cricket was advertised publicly https://app.beapplied.com/apply/smqkq0c7a6, Strauss said: “We’re very conscious there’s a ticking clock, both in terms of appointing a director of cricket and then of course the head coach or potentially coaches [plural] on the back of that. “The ambition is certainly to have the Test coach in place by the first Test of the summer [2 June versus New Zealand at Lord’s], although recruitment means there are all sorts of moving pieces, including notice periods.” Though Strauss will step aside after the first of these appointments, he remains chair of the cricket performance committee and an advisor to the ECB board. The wider review he is leading aims to have recommendations signed off this September to allow time before the start of the 2023 season. In its early stages – with independent consultants set to be hired – the project will look at the England men’s teams, the talent pathway and the domestic landscape. Strauss insists the goal is about England becoming No1 in all formats, rather than a specific drive designed to reboot the Test team, and the raising of standards. Strauss said: “I think there are a lot of areas where the game of cricket full stop can improve professionalism. That doesn’t mean it’s unprofessional. It’s just that if you start comparing it to other sports, and their approach, there are some areas.” Past such endeavours have either seen recommendations ignored – such as key strands of the Schofield Report in 2007 – or struggled to overcome an 18-team first-class structure that features a range of different priorities. Strauss, however, pointed to the ultimately successful World Cup project that began in 2015 as an example of how the game can come together. He added: “My gut feeling is that there will be a lot more that unites us than divides us through this process. If the shop window [the England men’s team] is functioning well, the knock-on effects for the game as a whole are enormous. And I sense an appetite for us to be bold in our approach.”",Sport/Sport,Ollie Robinson set to return for England in second Test against West Indies,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/14/ollie-robinson-set-to-return-for-england-in-second-test-against-west-indies
3/15/2022,"Richard Griffiths (Letters, 11 March) suggests that “the only way forward” from the current situation is for Ukraine’s independence to be guaranteed by a treaty to be signed “between Russia and the west”. Such a treaty already exists – the 1994 Budapest memorandum on security assurances. The memorandum guaranteed Ukrainian (and Belarusian and Kazhak) sovereignty and territorial integrity, prohibited the signatories from threatening or using military force against the three former Soviet and then independent states, and required the return of Soviet-era nuclear weapons on the three nations’ territory to be returned to Russian control. Russia has broken its obligations to Ukraine in 2014, by annexing Crimea and supporting breakaway statelets in Donbas, and by its current attack on Ukraine. It’s difficult to see how a treaty could resolve the situation when it is clear that Putin’s Russia has no intention of respecting existing treaties.Blaine StothardLondon  Prof Allan House (Letters, 8 March) is of course right to remind us that we all develop and assert ourselves within the social and political systems in which we exist. But he underestimates the sheer power of the narcissistic desperation that prevails among certain individuals who generate such vengeful rage against those who thwart them, way beyond the bounds set by those systems. Putin’s delusional “madness” stands out; so does that of Trump, Hitler and Stalin, to name but a few.

3/15/2022,"A teenager who is among three people accused of murdering a five-year-old boy had a “desire for violence” and threatened to kill the child and members of his foster family, a jury has been told. The 14-year-old boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, also used to “poke, pinch and kick” his social worker and would swear violently at her to try to aggravate her, the court heard. Logan Mwangi was found in the River Ogmore in south Wales on 31 July last year having suffered more than 50 injuries to his face, head and body. His mother, Angharad Williamson, 30, stepfather John Cole, 40, and the 14-year-old are on trial for his murder. In statements read to Cardiff crown court on Monday, members of a former foster family of the teenager claimed he made their lives “hell” when he lived with them in the months before Logan’s death. They claimed they had told his social worker that he had threatened Logan and them but she had brushed this off, an allegation she denies. The boy’s foster mother said she became concerned about what she called the teenager’s “desire for violence”, and said he wanted to spar with every person he met. She described his behaviour at one point as being like a “monster”. He allegedly told members of the family he wanted to kill them and said that if the plot of the film The Purge, which tells the story of a fictional holiday when all crime is allowed, was real, he would carry out his threat. The foster father said he became “terrified” of the youth, who had told him he wanted to “punch his lights out” and would walk around chanting about how he wanted to kill people. According to the family, the youth also tormented their dog, pulling him up by his hind legs and keep him dangling even though he was aware the pet had an injured pelvis. On one occasion he sprayed a can of deodorant into the dog’s eyes, the jury was told. The court heard how the teenager allegedly said he wanted to kill Logan. The foster family said they raised concerns about his behaviour and threats with his social worker Debbie Williams but they claimed she dismissed what they said as “nonsense”. “She just brushed it off as if it was nothing,” the foster mother said in her statement. Williams, giving evidence on Monday, broke down in tears when she described Logan as a “delightful little boy.” She said: “He was a happy boy. Bright eyes. He was very polite.” The social worker said that not long before Logan’s body was found she saw the teenager and he told her to “fuck off”. Williams said: “He told me to fuck off lots of time, it was more banter though sometimes he would go too far”. He had once called her a “cunt” and used to “poke, pinch and kick” her but she said he had never hurt her. Asked if the foster family told her that the youth had threatened to kill them and Logan, she said: “Absolutely not.” Williamson and the youth deny committing murder and perverting the course of justice. Cole denies murder but admits perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.

3/15/2022,"I was surprised that there was no coverage in the Guardian of the unveiling of a statue of the important suffragist Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy on International Women’s Day. The bronze statue – by the renowned artist Hazel Reeves, who also sculpted the wonderful “Our Emmeline” statue in Manchester – stands in the centre of Congleton, where Elizabeth lived for more than 50 years. Elizabeth, in partnership with Emmeline Pankhurst, helped to form the Women’s Social and Political Union and was described by Emmeline as “the brains behind the suffrage movement”. The statue was funded after a four-year campaign by a small group of local women, Elizabeth’s Group, who were determined to see the suffragist restored to her rightful place in history. The statue is one part of that campaign. I have little doubt that the Guardian archives contain many letters from Elizabeth, so prolific was she. She led many successful campaigns to address the issues of her day, including girls’ education, women’s property rights, the guardianship of infants, domestic violence – and, of course, her work to achieve votes for women.Susan MunroChair, Elizabeth’s Group  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/15/2022,"A police firearms officer is being investigated for potential homicide offences after an unarmed man was shot dead. Sean Fitzgerald, who was 31, was shot dead in January 2019 as he fled from a house in Coventry during an intelligence-planned raid by West Midlands police officers. Fitzgerald died after receiving a single gunshot wound to the chest. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) had previously said the officer was not the subject of a criminal investigation relating to the death of Fitzgerald. In April of last year, the firearms officer who shot Fitzgerald was served with a gross misconduct notice, although the IOPC did not call for the officer to be criminally investigated. However, the IOPC said on Monday it had now decided to conduct a criminal investigation. In a statement, Derrick Campbell, the IOPC regional director for the Midlands, said that the IOPC had “revisited” its position following a review of evidence obtained and legal advice. Campbell said it did not mean that criminal charges would necessarily follow. “At the conclusion of our investigation, we will decide whether to refer the matter to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether any charge(s) should be brought,” he said. “This was a tragic incident that led to a man losing his life and our thoughts remain with all of those affected by Mr Fitzgerald’s death.” The family of Fitzgerald, who have previously called for a criminal investigation to be opened following his death, welcomed the decision,. Liam Fitzgerald, Sean’s brother, said : “From very soon after Sean’s death, it has been my belief that this should have been a criminal investigation. I now hope that the investigation is concluded quickly and that a decision to bring criminal charges will follow,” he said. He added: “Sean was completely unarmed when he was killed, and I believe the force used was unnecessary and disproportionate.” Three murder or manslaughter charges have been brought against police involved in fatal shootings since Inquest began recording these incidents since 1990, it says. In all cases, the officers were found not guilty or the trial collapsed. Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, said while the IOPC’s decision was welcome, the fatal shooting of Fitzgerald “raises serious questions and concerns, and requires the utmost scrutiny”. She added: “Accountability to the criminal standard for police officers or forces involved in deaths is rare, leading to concerns that police are too often above the law. It is essential that fatal use of force by police is examined with this high level of scrutiny. “We hope this criminal investigation is conducted promptly, rigorously and sensitively in order to establish the truth and hold those responsible for any wrongdoing to account.”",News/UK news,Police officer faces criminal inquiry over fatal shooting of unarmed man,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/14/police-officer-faces-criminal-inquiry-over-fatal-shooting-of-unarmed-man

3/15/2022,"Keir Starmer turned down a lengthy photo opportunity with Evgeny Lebedev shortly after he became Labour leader, the Guardian can reveal, with aides citing a desire to keep the Russian businessman at arm’s length. Starmer, the MP for Holborn and St Pancras in north London, was invited to spend the day with the proprietor of the Evening Standard and the Independent during the first months of the Covid pandemic. The invitation in June 2020 involved a planned visit to a church in Kensington, where Starmer would be greeted by Lord Lebedev and see the church’s efforts to feed homeless people. The pair were to prepare meals with volunteer chefs and hand out packed lunches together. Starmer’s team turned down the offer to be pictured alongside Lebedev, though said they were prepared to send a supportive quote. Sources said the invitation had been extended after a Zoom meeting with Standard staff where the possibility of a visit was initially raised with Starmer. Lebedev, the son of a former KGB agent, was given a peerage by Boris Johnson, who has insisted he is not a security risk. Johnson denied he intervened to secure a peerage for Lebedev after intelligence services had warned it would be a security risk, after reports in the Guardian and Sunday Times. Lebedev has condemned the invasion of Ukraine and called on Vladimir Putin to withdraw his troops. “At the moment many with Russian roots are under scrutiny, including myself,” Lebedev wrote. “I understand the reason for this as it is inevitable when events of such magnitude occur and the world order as we have known it in recent decades suddenly gets torn up.” Lebedev, who joined the House of Lords in November 2020 as a crossbencher, said he was “not a security risk to this country, which I love” and that while his father had been a KGB agent, he was “not some agent of Russia”. “Being Russian does not automatically make one an enemy of the state, and it is crucial we do not descend into Russophobia, like any other phobia, bigotry or discrimination,” Lebedev said. Though he has said he is not supportive of the Kremlin regime, Lebedev has used some of his public profile to question the British line on matters related to Russia, including tweets that raised whether the defector Alexander Litvinenko was “murdered by MI6”, quoting a Mail article. In 2014 he told Andrew Marr that Crimea had been “for many years” part of Russia and that “Russia has reached out to the west and I think now it’s time to stop cold war rhetoric on both sides”. In 2015 he wrote that the Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, was better for the west’s “security and interests”, adding: “On this point I am emphatically with Putin.” Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions, wrote to Lord Bew, the chair of the House of Lords appointments commission, to ask him to reassess the peerage. “For Boris Johnson to nominate to the House of Lords someone who has promoted the worst conspiracy theories and defences of Vladimir Putin shows just how flawed the prime minister’s judgment is,” he said. “The accusations made by Lord Lebedev that the British security services had any involvement in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko is insulting. I have seen first-hand the real impact of Russian interference in Britain and the difficulties prosecutors encounter when dealing with those who act on behalf of Putin. This is a clearly a matter of national security.” Labour politicians have been courted by Lebedev in the past. Ed Miliband attended a party thrown by the mogul at Lebedev’s house in west London to mark the launch of London Live. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have also attended his events, with Blair interviewed by Lebedev personally for a piece in the Independent. Brown’s wife, Sarah, attended a black-tie fundraiser hosted by Lebedev. Lebedev has been approached for comment.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer turned down photo op with Evgeny Lebedev in 2020,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/14/keir-starmer-turned-down-photo-op-with-evgeny-lebedev-in-2020
3/15/2022,"Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, wife of the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, has admitted attending a rally which preceded the January 6 attack on the US Capitol but denied helping to plan it. In an interview with the Washington Free Beacon, Thomas, a conservative activist who runs a political lobbying firm, said she briefly attended the rally near the White House on 6 January 2021 but left before Donald Trump addressed the crowed. Trump used his address to tell supporters to “fight like hell” in support of his lie that his defeat by Joe Biden was the result of electoral fraud. A bipartisan Senate report said seven deaths were connected to the assault on Congress which followed. Thomas said brief attendance at the rally was the full extent of her involvement. “I was disappointed and frustrated that there was violence that happened following a peaceful gathering of Trump supporters on the Ellipse on 6 January,” she told the Free Beacon, a conservative site. Investigations by the New York Times and the New Yorker have raised questions about Thomas’s ties to organizers of the January 6 rally. According to the Times, Thomas sits on the board of a rightwing group that circulated “action steps” after the 2020 election, in an attempt to keep Trump in power. One of the organizers of the rally told the Times Thomas was a peacekeeper between various factions. Thomas denied those allegations. “I played no role with those who were planning and leading the 6 January events,” she said. The Times told the Free Beacon it stood by its “fair and accurate” reporting. Thomas, who has been involved in conservative activism for decades, also categorically rejected any suggestion her political activities present a conflict of interest for her husband. Some judicial ethics experts have called on Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from cases involving causes with which his wife has been involved. However, Ginni Thomas’s comments on the morning of 6 January only intensified questions about her husband’s possible conflicts of interest. In a series of Facebook posts that are no longer visible, Thomas said “LOVE MAGA people!!!!” and “GOD BLESS EACH OF YOU STANDING UP or PRAYING!” She later added a note that the posts were written before the attack on the Capitol, according to Slate. Thomas has insisted her activism has no bearing on her husband’s rulings, saying they have kept their careers separate since he was confirmed in 1991. “Like so many married couples, we share many of the same ideals, principles and aspirations for America,” Thomas told the Free Beacon. “But we have our own separate careers and our own ideas and opinions too. Clarence doesn’t discuss his work with me and I don’t involve him in my work.” Justice Thomas’s critics will closely scrutinize his work related to the Capitol attack. In January, he provided an early hint about his opinion of efforts to investigate January 6. The supreme court rejected Trump’s request to stop a House select committee accessing his White House records.

3/15/2022,"Liz Truss is expected to name hundreds of oligarchs, individuals and organisations to be added to the UK’s sanctions list on Tuesday, after a fast-tracked bill is passed that will make it easier for ministers to sanction those with Kremlin links. Whitehall sources said the UK’s sanctions list would soon be on a par with the European Union after the legal reforms. Officials are also understood to be exploring potential sanctions on Russia’s federation council members, equivalent to the US Senate. The EU sanctioned 146 members last week who voted to approve recognition of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine as independent states. “Liz has moved heaven and Earth to get this legislation done. It transforms our ability to sanction Russia and go further and faster than before,” one government source said. MPs and peers are expected to sit late into the the night to ensure the passage of the economic crime bill overnight, with ministers redrawing parts to close a number of loopholes that would allow oligarchs and kleptocrats to evade scrutiny under a new public register of beneficial interests. After criticism in the House of Commons last week, ministers have proposed a series of amendments in the House of Lords to toughen up the bill, including a new proposal that wealthy owners who try to sell off property in order to avoid it being listed in the register will be forced to declare their details upon sale. Peers hope to push the government to go further and reduce the time period given to owners to declare their interests from six months to three. Conservative MPs have signalled they could support the reduction if the amendment is returned to the Commons. The bill targets those who hide wealth in the UK, particularly through property purchases. These include those who might be seeking to shelter illicitly acquired money. The bill will reform Companies House in an attempt to verify the identity of every company director and beneficial owner, with the aim of preventing criminals or kleptocrats from hiding behind a UK shell company. Ministers have also scrapped the defence that owners did not commit an offence if they claim not to realise they have provided false information, as it must be given “knowingly or recklessly”, after objections in the Commons by the Labour MP Chris Bryant. Those who make an unintentional false declaration will still be penalised, but not as harshly, according to the government’s new amendment. The government has also moved to address a loophole highlighted by the Lib Dems’ Layla Moran, which would have given the government the power to grant individuals an exemption from its registration requirements if it was in “the interests of the economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom”. The government plans a second economic crime bill in the next parliamentary session, including further reforms of Companies House, in an acknowledgment that the fast-tracked bill is imperfect. MPs and peers have expressed significant concern about the enforcement of the new requirements, as well as new sanctions and the low budget for implementation compared with countries such as the US. The author and anti-corruption campaigner Oliver Bullough said there were numerous ways for oligarchs to get around the transparency declarations, including owning the offshore company in equal shares of 16.67% with five close relatives so none reach the 25% ownership level required to count as the person of “significant control”. Bullough said falsified ownership records had also been used for decades – because there were little to no checks on the information provided.",News/World news,UK to expand Russia sanctions list as bill is fast-tracked,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/uk-to-expand-russia-sanctions-list-fast-tracked-bill
3/15/2022,"As the coup against President Salvador Allende in Chile unfolded on 11 September 1973, Hugh O’Shaughnessy was one of the few foreign correspondents in the capital, Santiago, and was able to give an eyewitness account of the seizure of power by the armed forces, and the death of the president. Forty years later, O’Shaughnessy recalled that he walked back to his hotel through the deserted streets, hands in the air, to find Pinochet’s rich supporters already celebrating victory: “They whooped as he announced on television the closing down of congress, the political parties, the trade unions and the judges.” In order to report as a freelance journalist on Latin America, O’Shaughnessy, who has died aged 87, had taken the typically bold step of uprooting his family to the Chilean capital in 1966, when he first met and became friends with Allende, then the Socialist party leader. O’Shaughnessy’s view that the 1973 coup was engineered by the US made him a trenchant critic of that country’s role in Latin America from then on. In October 1983 he again found himself at the centre of events on the island of Grenada in the Caribbean when US forces moved in to overthrow the revolutionary government – the only occasion when there was direct confrontation between US and Cuban troops. He later published a book about his experiences there: Grenada: Revolution, Invasion and Aftermath (1984). For 30 years, O’Shaughnessy seemed to appear everywhere, from Argentina to Mexico, usually properly suited and booted, and taking advantage of his vast network of friends and contacts to send perceptive reports back for the Financial Times, and in later years the Observer and the Guardian, as well as being a regular contributor to the Tablet, the Catholic weekly. A lifelong Catholic, he also wrote regularly about the church, in particular its poor record on human rights in Argentina, Chile and elsewhere. He was a staunch supporter of the leftwing clergy in Nicaragua’s revolutionary Sandinista government, and of Oscar Romero, archbishop of El Salvador, and wrote a biography of Fernando Lugo, the Roman Catholic bishop who was president of Paraguay from 2008 until 2012 (The Priest of Paraguay: Fernando Lugo and the Making of a Nation, 2009). At the same time, he was scathing in his contempt for more reactionary elements in the church, such as Marcial Maciel Degollado, the founder of the Legionaries of Christ, whom he memorably described thus: “The pushy Mexican priest [was] the bisexual pederast, drug-addicted lover of several women and father of three who hoodwinked a succession of popes.” Born in Reading, Hugh was the only child of Irish immigrants. His father, Charles O’Shaughnessy, worked as a porter at the Home Office, and his mother, Mary (nee Donovan), was an administrative assistant. Evacuated during the second world war to stay with cousins in Cork, Hugh developed during his years there a love of Ireland and the Irish that remained with him all his life. When he returned to England at the end of the war, his family was living in Chiswick, west London; Hugh was educated at the Catholic St Benedict’s school in Ealing, and subsequently at Worcester College, Oxford, where he studied modern languages and met Georgina Alliston (Georgie), whom he married in 1937. After national service and a short spell working for Rowntree’s in York, he was determined to use his language skills to pursue a career as a journalist, in particular in Latin America. The 1970s was a decade of brutal dictatorships throughout the region, and O’Shaughnessy reported from many of the countries where grave human rights abuses were being committed. He was equally active in Latin American affairs when in Britain. He worked with Amnesty International and other organisations helping refugees from Chile, Argentina and other countries. A stalwart of the Catholic Institute for International Relations (CIIR), he was one of the founders of the Latin America Bureau, a charity promoting the defence of human rights and social justice in the region. He later helped launch the Latin American Newsletters, an influential weekly series of newsletters analysing events throughout the area. Somehow he also found time to write a series of books, perhaps most notably Latin Americans (1988); Around the Spanish Main: Travels in the Caribbean and the Guianas (1991); and Pinochet: The Politics of Torture (1999), written at the time of the Chilean dictator’s arrest in London. One of his most moving articles was written following the death of Georgie, his wife of “50 years and 36 hours”, of a brain tumour in 2011. In it, he spoke of the magnificent care offered by NHS doctors and nurses, but bemoaned how the service was being privatised even then: “It seemed bizarre that the NHS was manoeuvred by an aggressive privatisation lobby into accepting a clearly inferior service from a company run from a country incapable of organising a health service for its own citizens.” O’Shaughnessy won two British Press awards, the 1986 Maria Moors Cabot prize for journalistic contributions to inter-American understanding, and the Wilberforce Medallion from the city of Hull. Yet he was perhaps most proud of the honours that he received from Michelle Bachelet during her periods as president of Chile, in recognition of his support for its people during the years of repression. In his final years he suffered from increasingly poor health, but remained typically active and sociable. His son Thomas died in 1985. He is survived by his children Frances, Matthew and Luke.

3/15/2022,"Over the past five-and-a-bit series, Peaky Blinders has had no shortage of knowing cameos from genuine historical figures. So far, the current run has resembled an interwar history textbook that has come to life, then been moodily lit and mumblingly soundtracked, with Oswald Mosley, Diana Mitford and Winston Churchill all popping up. The BBC has even devoted an entire two-part crime documentary, The Real Peaky Blinders (whose finale airs tonight), to the show’s love of real-life history – presenting the true stories that inspired dramatist Steven Knight. But who was the best? Who was the most historically accurate? And who was fairly impossible to judge against their real-life equivalent, but we don’t care because they’re Tom actual Hardy? Here’s our ranking of every real-life figure that has rubbed tweed shoulders with the Shelby clan … Bottom of our ranking because Alphonse Capone hasn’t yet appeared on-screen, although Tommy was overheard on the phone to him. When Tommy sent cousin Michael to forge alliances Stateside, these included a bootlegging deal with the Chicago mobster. Rival mafioso Luca Changretta (Adrien Brody) sneered “You been talking to that fat fuck?” – shortly before Arthur spattered his brains all over a gin still. When Stephen Graham joined the series-six cast, there was speculation that he’d play Capone, as he did in Boardwalk Empire. However, writer Steven Knight told a podcast: “It’s a minefield once you get into Chicago gangsters. I referred to him but didn’t want to go too far west.” Watch this fat fuck-shaped space. Played by craggy character actor Donald Sumpter (AKA Game of Thrones’ Maester Luwin), Bigge was the desk-thumping King’s Private Secretary who dealt with the series four case against Polly, Arthur, John and Michael, which almost got them hanged until a last-gasp reprieve. The real Bigge was a decorated army officer who became an influential senior courtier to Queen Victoria and King George V, serving monarchs for 36 years. The Notorious B.I.G.G.E, as nobody has called him until literally just now. A fleeting incidental character, hence his low placing. A decent villain who loses points for lack of historical accuracy. This spivvy slimeball, portrayed by Charlie Creed-Miles in series one, was leader of The Birmingham Boys who ran local horse-racing rackets. The Peaky Blinders made a power-grab for their turf, resulting in a gunfight outside the Garrison, during which Tommy shot Kimber in the head. As The Real Peaky Blinders makes clear, Kimber was actually a far bigger figure in gangland history. The burly bruiser started out in Brum street gangs at the age of 12, worked his way up the underworld ladder, expanded his empire south and become Britain’s first nationwide crime kingpin. The documentary calls him “Britain’s answer to Al Capone”. The real Kimber was shot during a fight with Alfie Solomons (more of him shortly) but survived and fled to the US – where he ended up working for Capone himself. A cheeky entry who only appeared in pictorial form. After the Garrison was blown up in series two, Tommy visited the rival Black Lion pub to find answers. Behind the bar was a framed portrait of famed Irish revolutionary leader, Collins, mounted on a tricolour flag. Tommy was duly hooded and led to an abattoir rendezvous with the IRA. This tied into the conspiracy plot that saw Winston Churchill and Major Chester Campbell (Sam Neill) hiring Tommy to bump off Field Marshal Russell – a facsimile of loyalist politician Sir Henry Wilson. In real life, it was Collins who was suspected of orchestrating Wilson’s 1922 shooting. Collins was himself assassinated two months later. Billy “Brilliant” Chang has a pivotal role in the Peaky endgame as source of the plot-driving opium. Played by Andrew Koji, he’s the Triad leader who hired an assassin to pose as a sex worker and hold frisky Finn Shelby at gunpoint. This got the attention of big bro Tommy, to whom Chang offered a lucrative shipment from Shanghai: the purest opium ever seen on European shores. Its $5m value promised to make up for the losses Tommy suffered in the Wall Street Crash. The real Chang was a charismatic immigrant who ran a Cantonese restaurant in Birmingham before moving into the drug trade. The press dubbed him a “dope king” but his empire crumbled after he was implicated in the death by overdose of bar hostess Freda Kempton. Police found cocaine in Chang’s home and he was deported. Not so brilliant after all. He really did wear fancy fur-collared overcoats, though, so the show is at least sartorially specific. Smugly announcing herself as “Oswald’s most recent and last-ever mistress”, the Sieg Heil-ing Sloane arrived only last week but wasted no time becoming a hiss-boo villainess. Played by Amber Anderson, she name-dropped our “friend in Berlin”, flirted with Tommy and tried to humiliate Lizzie – who clapped back by pointing out that she’d “fucked your future husband”. Touché, bab. MI5 files described the real-life Mitford as “far cleverer and more dangerous than her husband”. Her 1989 episode of Desert Island Discs, during which she denied the extent of the Holocaust, was one of the show’s most controversial. Even Sue Lawley sounded shocked. Mitford’s dramatic alter ego is suitably vile but there have been grumbles that Anderson’s accent isn’t posh enough. Hints that she is an amphetamine-using bisexual are also a little fanciful. Series two saw the Shelby brothers “on fookin’ holiday” in London, causing a kerfuffle in The Eden Club – a bacchanalian nightspot belonging to scar-faced Italian mob boss Sabini (moustachioed Noah Taylor). In retaliation, Sabini’s men kidnapped Ada and performed impromptu dentistry on Tommy. The Peaky Blinders ultimately prevailed by seizing Sabini’s bookies’ pitches on Derby Day. Sabini resurfaced as a background presence in series four, helping Luca Changretta with his vendetta against Tommy. The real Charles “Darby” Sabini was a former welterweight boxer who carried a hammer and kept a revolver under his pillow at night. He headed a profitable Clerkenwell-based gang but deliberately dressed shabbily to keep a low profile (a detail that the style-conscious drama omitted). Humiliatingly, Sabini was bankrupted by losing a libel action against a newspaper that called him a gangster. Well, duh. The union firebrand arrived in series four, played by Happy Valley’s Charlie Murphy. Eden was the shop steward who led Tommy’s female factory workforce out on strike, before staging a mass equal-pay protest in the Bull Ring. When Tommy tried to broker a wage deal, she outmanoeuvred him by knowing about his murky past. They later bonded over their mutual postwar heartbreak and became lovers, with Tommy slyly using Jessie for information on her communist contacts. The portrayal cheesed off historians, who criticised the focus on a fictional romance rather than Eden’s real-life achievements as a champion of worker’s rights. Put it back in your worsted trousers, Tom. A cool cameo, albeit a fittingly silent one. The Little Tramp made a series two appearance when Tommy took lost love Grace on a night out in that fancy London. He knew Chaplin’s bodyguard, Wag McDonald (another name borrowed from a real-life gangster), who fixed it for the couple to meet the megastar (played by Robert Elkin) while he was in the capital promoting his latest film. There has long been speculation that Chaplin, who officially hailed from south London, was actually born on the Black Patch, a Gypsy camp in Smethwick, but kept his Romani roots secret. He was mentioned again in the series-six opener when Lizzie name-dropped: “This projector was a gift from Charlie fucking Chaplin. He sent it all the way from Hollywood.” Clang. “Shalom, Arfur, Shalom!” Played by a bewhiskered Tom Hardy since series two, fan favourite Alfie is the volatile leader of a Jewish gang in Camden. He runs an illegal rum distillery and aligned with the Peaky Blinders against his longtime rival Darby Sabini. He and Tommy have since been frenemies who take it in turns to do business, betray one another and swap ownership of Cyril the dog. It’s always a highlight when wind-up merchant Alfie tips up to chew scenery, ramble on like a glitching Guy Ritchie DVD and turn the air blue with baroque swearing. The real-life Alfred Solomon (singular) was a Jewish bookmaker with underworld connections who was involved in the racetrack wars and ran a bakery as a front. He was convicted for manslaughter after fatally knifing a fellow thug during a card game. It probably wasn’t Snap or Strip Poker. Alfie earns a high placing for loveability but only a bronze medal, due to cartoonishness. “You’ve met bad men before. But the man you’re about to meet is the devil.” So said Tommy in series five as fascist leader Oswald Mosley swaggered into view. Played by ‘tache-twirling Sam Claflin, he’s suavely sinister, shags anything that moves and has influential allies everywhere. Tommy’s attempt to assassinate Mosley backfired so badly that Tommy wondered if he was “the man I can’t defeat”. The real-life Mosley was a skilled orator, once tipped as a future prime minister, who crossed the floor from Tory to Labour before founding the British Union of Fascists in 1932. The party built a sizeable following as fascism spread across Europe but Mosley wound up disgraced and imprisoned. Couldn’t happen to a nicer bloke. Peaky Blinders captures his reptilian charm and influential connections well but Mosley can’t win, because, well, he just can’t. Well, who else could top our chart than dear old Winnie? As in real life, he triumphs for longevity and the reassuring sight of his hulking, Havana-puffing silhouette. Virtually an honorary Peaky Blinder, the jowly statesman has been a recurring presence since series one. Then secretary of state for war, he set the whole story in motion by sending prize git Campbell to Birmingham to recover a stolen cache of machine guns. In series two, cheeky Churchill was seen sketching a nude life model in his office. He saved Tommy’s life so he could serve the crown, mainly by carrying out assassinations. Tommy now feeds his twinkly old ally intel on the fascists. Churchill has been portrayed by a tag-team of actors: first Andy Nyman, then Richard McCabe, now Neil Maskell. Next in line is probably Churchill the insurance dog. Oh yes. Peaky Blinders airs Sundays at 9pm on BBC One. The Real Peaky Blinders airs Mondays at 9pm on BBC Two.

3/15/2022,"For the first mile or so Christopher Mallaby walked and stumbled through a maze of British rocks and puddles into the still raw and unfinished Channel tunnel. Then he got on to a makeshift buggy for the next 35 miles. The final mile he completed on foot to emerge in Calais as the new British ambassador to France. It had been Christopher’s idea to inaugurate his ambassadorship there in 1993 by becoming the first diplomat ever to make a land journey from Britain to the European mainland. Christopher, who has died aged 85, was one of Britain’s pre-eminent postwar diplomats. From 1960 to 1996 he was at the centre of diplomatic activity surrounding the end of the cold war and German reunification. Fluent in French, German and Russian, he was a fledgling diplomat in Moscow during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. He was back in Moscow in a senior position from 1975 to 1977, a period when the adoption of the Helsinki accords was beginning to help east-west relations, and from henceforth always landed in the right postings, either in the Russian capital, London or Bonn – later moving to Berlin – to help steer British policy as cold war tensions eased. As British ambassador (1988-92) in what was initially West Germany when the Berlin Wall came down, Christopher was an early convert to reunification and had the courage to be blunt with Margaret Thatcher over her unrealistic opposition to a united Germany. He battled hard to reconcile her to that inevitability, which, when it came in 1990, prompted crucial discussions about the future role of Nato. In his memoir, Living the Cold War (2017), he gave an account of the diplomatic manoeuvring at that time, which Vladimir Putin is now exploiting to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Christopher wrote that the US secretary of state, James Baker, “told Mikhail Gorbachev in early February 1990 that the borders of Nato would not move further eastward than united Germany. He offered a guarantee on this on the assumption that Gorbachev would agree that Nato would continue to exist and US forces would be stationed in Europe under Nato.” Christopher added that Helmut Kohl of Germany and the then prime minister, John Major, gave the Russians a similar undertaking. However, the US president, George HW Bush, “immediately decided that this undertaking should not be made”. Gorbachev did not ask for a written record of these exchanges and the way was left open for dangerous controversy. As he observed at the time of his memoir, “a truculent Putin and the Russian people now see themselves as surrounded by a truculent west … and believe that the west wants to add Ukraine to Nato”. While Christopher recognised the dangers of expanding Nato into the Baltics and eastern Europe, he nevertheless concluded it would give them essential security guarantees against Russia. Born in London, Christopher came from a military family and was only nine years old when his father, Maj Gen Aubertin Mallaby, was assassinated in Indonesia. His mother, Margaret (nee Jones), his brother, Anthony, and sister, Sue, were left in straitened circumstances, but both boys were awarded bursaries to go to Eton. After a stint of national service that took Christopher for his first extended stay in West Germany, he spent three years at King’s College, Cambridge, initially studying French and German before turning to modern history. The army experience taught Christopher that he did not want to follow in his father’s footsteps. In search of another form of public service, he turned to the Foreign Office, where in 1959 he passed the entrance exams with flying colours. He had found his metier. He had also found the love of his life, Pascale Thierry-Mieg, and they married shortly before going to Moscow in 1961. His first contact with cold war diplomacy came in 1960, when he was posted to the United Nations during the general assembly, where east-west tensions were on full display. He continued to be in the right place as a 23-year-old junior in Moscow, when he was conveniently at hand to replace an interpreter during a British businessman’s conversation with the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev. He was London-based as head of policy planning (1980-82) when he was asked to coordinate Foreign Office work on the Falklands crisis and had his first direct contact with Thatcher. He worked with the prime minister again during the negotiation of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. The three years of his final posting, as ambassador in Paris, gave him ample scope for promoting Anglo-French cooperation. He had considerable access to presidents François Mitterand and Jacques Chirac, and a kaleidoscopic cross-section of French society was invited to the palatial embassy. The former health minister and Auschwitz survivor Simone Veil became a close friend. Pamela Harriman, the US ambassador, would slip through the garden gate between the two embassies for informal chats. Christopher was managing director of what became UBS Investment Bank (2000-06), had a four-year term as chairman of Somerset House Trust, and six years as a trustee of the Tate. He also served as deputy chairman of Reuters (1998-2013), and chairman of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (2001-13). Knighted in 1996, he made lasting friendships in every post. “I loved almost every moment of my career,” he wrote in his memoir. Pascale died in 2020. Christopher is survived by a son, Sebastian, and three daughters, Emily, Julia and Charlotte.

3/15/2022,"When you have known someone for a long time, you can cover a lot of ground extremely fast. I met a friend of 30 years, by the recycling bins. She had just been on the phone to someone who was going with a fleet of ambulances to Ukraine, and had asked her to go with them. “I was just saying ‘yes’, when my phone ran out of battery. Then I realised that I don’t have a skill set for this. No nursing training. I haven’t driven since I was 11. Imagine how embarrassing that would be; driving across five countries and you can’t even take over for two hours. I don’t even have the competence to keep my phone charged when I’m right next to some electricity.” We just stood for a bit and boggled at the unimaginability of that idea. You might accidentally agree to drive into a war zone, having forgotten that you couldn’t drive, and that doomed enterprise was only averted because you’d forgotten to charge your phone. But the whole thing is unimaginable. It turns out it is possible to veer, all day long, between very strong emotions: impotent compassion, guilt and anger. Rage is the convenient feeling, more energising than compassion and much more comfortable than guilt. That’s why you always end up hating someone if you wrong them. Your infinitely creative brain finds a reason that it’s their fault. That’s the theory with domestic, day-to-day emotions, anyway. Geopolitical rage isn’t comfortable at all. Sit for any amount of time with the fact that one vapid, brutal autocrat can destroy so many lives, can extinguish a vast furnace of love with his ego, and you might just explode with anger. The guilt is over all the conflicts I didn’t wake up every morning thinking about, which tips into more impotence. In the end, what difference am I making by caring or not? What difference does it make to a mother going into labour while being shelled, later dying, along with her baby, that I tried to imagine her horror? This is the brain fog of war. It’s impossible to think straight, because thinking about violence goes nowhere, yields no new insight, has no texture. The alternative would be to not think about violence, an absurd idea. Everybody’s in the same state. If you’re not talking about Ukraine, you’re thinking about it, so everything else you say is gibberish. It’s better just to talk about it, but say what? So I read long analyses by mechanics about tank maintenance, and rubber perishing, and mud, and watch short videos of unimaginably brave Russian women being arrested, and listen to the amazing ingenuity and courage of families making their escape from Mariupol, and wish we had a better home secretary, and try to remember how to spell basic words. I read competing versions of Russia’s military prowess. (Is it much weaker than we thought, or is this just decoy incompetence to soften up the watching world for when the competence begins?) I roam about admiring acts of sabotage on social media. I never realised how witty brave people often are, but it makes a kind of sense, for humour and courage to come from the same root. I try to balance the probabilities on China’s next course of action, by my gut sense of who among the thinkers looks most trustworthy in their Twitter profile. This is a stupid thing to do. When all this is over, people say, the world will be changed. We keep saying that about things. Some phrases I don’t understand, because they don’t mean anything (“new normal”). Others, I’m only beginning to understand as they draw to a close (“rules-based order”). The brutal truth is as true for Ukraine as it was for Covid: that those who lose the people they love will be changed for ever, and the rest will find 100 really solid reasons why it’s time to move on. We might be more human while we’re not thinking straight.",Opinion/Opinion,The impotent fury of watching the war in Ukraine is giving us all brain fog,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/14/watching-ukraine-war-brain-fog
