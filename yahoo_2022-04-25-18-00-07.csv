4/25/2022,"Donald Trump‚Äôs one-time personal attorney Michael Cohen had a fit Sunday after his former boss yet again boasted that he aced an intelligence test in the White House that was actually an assessment to check for cognitive impairment. And that was just one of the ‚Äústupid, stupid‚Äù things Trump said at a political rally in Ohio on Saturday, a revved up Cohen complained in a video by the Meidas Touch PAC. Trump told the crowd he took the 2018 test to prove he was more intelligent than ‚Äúradical left maniacs.‚Äù As has been explained repeatedly in the media, it was actually a Montreal Cognitive Assessment, designed to detect things like early signs of dementia ‚Äî not intelligence. The questions are simple, and ask if the test subject can, for example, identify a camel, and remember five words ‚Äî in Trump‚Äôs case, ‚Äúperson, woman, man, camera, TV‚Äù ‚Äî which he has demonstrated he could do on TV. Cohen mocked Trump‚Äôs five words and how spectacularly unimpressive reciting them are. ‚ÄúThe only people who are amazed are you, you and you,‚Äù he snapped. Yet ‚Äúnobody really actually called you on it.‚Äù If Trump has such an impressive IQ, Cohen wondered, why did he have to write letters to all of Trump‚Äôs schools warning them not to release his grades or test scores? Cohen also asked why people still go to Trump rallies. ‚ÄúIs it to watch a shit show? To watch the clown carnival barker?‚Äù he asked. Cohen ended with a plea for everyone to vote. ‚ÄúI know the man better than all, and rest assured, this man does not belong in the White House,‚Äù he said.

4/25/2022,"Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko has outlined how Russian President Vladimir Putin can be defeated. In an op-ed, Yushchenko wrote that the Putin he once dealt with as Ukraine's leader ""no longer exists."" He said Putin is now a ""completely isolated and brutal despot who cannot stand any opposition."" Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, who led the country from 2005 to 2010, has outlined a three-prong approach that he believes will help defeat Vladimir Putin. In an op-ed for The Guardian published on Sunday, Yushchenko said Ukraine now faces a ""savage army"" led by someone he once had a personal history with but has since morphed into a ""dictator."" ""My own history with Putin goes back to 2000 when we were both prime ministers of our respective countries. It was only when I ran to be president of Ukraine in 2004 that he actively campaigned against me,"" Yushchenko wrote. ""The extreme lengths he was willing to go to in order to get what he wanted became clear. I could not allow this to deter me; after I won, I realized that I needed to try to keep a workable relationship with him as the leader of our neighbor in the east,"" he wrote. ""But the Putin I dealt with then no longer exists. He has since become a completely isolated and brutal despot who cannot stand any opposition,"" he added. According to Yushchenko, one thing that ""really bothers"" Putin is ""international solidarity and support."" He wrote that for Ukraine to succeed, there must not be fatigue in the global community towards ""the horrors of war."" This would help those fighting against Putin avoid losing sight of victory ‚Äî particularly now that the Russian army is re-grouping before the next onslaught. Yushchenko added that a second prong involves continued weapons and military assistance, which would be vital for the battle ahead. ""Our army continues to need weapons and military assistance from all our allies,"" he wrote. ""And we need monetary assistance to help us plug the holes that this war is blowing in our previously strong economy."" A third prong concerns how civil societies can and should continue helping Ukrainian forces to obtain ""non-lethal supplies"" and protective equipment. ""I strongly believe that victory for Ukraine is inevitable,"" Yushchenko wrote. ""When ordinary Ukrainians give everything up to fight for their freedom and dignity, victory is the only option.""

4/25/2022,"FIRST ON FOX: Hunter Biden sent an email to his brother‚Äôs widow, Hallie Biden, pressuring her to get an HIV test as their relationship deteriorated in July 2018, about a month before he fathered a child with another woman. In an email titled, ""YOU NEED TO GET TESTED FOR HIV HALLIE,"" obtained by Fox News Digital, Hunter demanded that Hallie get tested for HIV and inform him of the results that day. The email also accused Hallie of turning Hunter‚Äôs niece against him and called on Hallie to seek ""serious long term professional help."" HUNTER BIDEN‚ÄôS EX-LOVERS COULD COME BACK TO HAUNT HIM AS FEDERAL GRAND JURY INVESTIGATES HIS TAX AFFAIRS ""You need to inform me of the result. TODAY,"" Hunter wrote at the time. ""I am getting tested today. I have been sick scared Hallie and you [hang] up on me. The love you give is so disturbing."" ""I love you [Hallie] even when you‚Äôre cruel,"" he added. ""GET TESTED AND TELL ME RESULTS Today."" In earlier email exchanges that same month, Hallie called Biden a ""passive aggressive a--hole"" and Hunter advised her to ""focus on your sobriety."" ""I hope you have someone to turn to in bed in my brothers‚Äô house and that that act of love can be for him or her or them and not a secret someone,"" Hunter wrote to Hallie on July 15, 2018. ""And don‚Äôt feel as if you lost the two best men you or anyone could have ever even dreamed of."" Hunter revealed the details of his affair with Hallie in his 2021 memoir ""Beautiful Things,"" explaining that he and Hallie started a relationship in 2016 about a year after his brother, Beau, died of brain cancer. Hunter said he successfully convinced his dad, now-President Joe Biden, to issue a statement condoning the affair in 2017 after he was initially reluctant to offer public support. ""We are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness,"" the elder Biden said in a statement. ""They have mine and Jill‚Äôs full and complete support and we are happy for them."" BIDEN ‚ÄòTRYING TO HIDE‚Äô WHO HE HAS MET WITH, PETER SCHWEIZER SAYS Hunter was married to Kathleen Buhle but separated at the time of the affair, and the two finalized their divorce in April 2017. During that same time, while living with Hallie, Hunter started a sexual relationship with Hallie‚Äôs older sister, Elizabeth Secundy, in addition to ex-stripper Lunden Roberts. In July 2018, the same month that Biden sent his email to Hallie demanding she get an HIV test, Hunter was infamously blacklisted from the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles due to his drug use over the course of five months staying at the hotel, according to Miranda Devine‚Äôs book ""Laptop from Hell."" One month later, in August 2018, Hunter‚Äôs child with Roberts was born. Hunter and Hallie eventually split in late 2018, which became public in 2019. In one email Hunter sent to Hallie in December 2018, Hunter called her a ""clueless, middle-aged, over botoxed flat a-- loser."" One day later, Hallie responded, in part, ""Please stop the nasty emails and anger. I‚Äôm not against you."" Hunter's jab at Hallie came in response to an email from the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children's Vice-Chair Fred Sears to Hallie, Hunter, and Valerie Biden Owens, the younger sister of President Biden, discussing salary arrangements for Josh Alcorn. Alcorn was serving as the Beau Biden Foundation's ""Chief Operating Officer"" at the time. Biden initially denied being the father of Roberts‚Äô child, claiming in his memoir that he had ""no recollection"" of Roberts. In January 2020, an Arkansas judge ruled that Hunter was the ""biological and legal father"" of Roberts‚Äô child and ordered Hunter to pay back child support. In February of this year, Roberts became the latest to testify in response to subpoenas issued in the Department of Justice's investigation into Biden's finances. Hunter's ex-girlfriend, lingerie entrepreneur Zoe Kestan, also recently testified before the grand jury in Delaware, the New York Post reported. Kestan reportedly told the grand jury about Hunter's lavish spending habits at luxury hotels in New York and California. Hunter, who is now married to South African filmmaker Melissa Cohen, first revealed in December 2020 that his ""tax affairs"" were under federal investigation. David Weiss, the U.S. attorney for the District of Delaware, is overseeing the investigation. The Senate Homeland Security Committee and Senate Finance Committee conducted an investigation in 2020 into Hunter's foreign business dealings during his father's tenure as vice president and discovered that there were at least four large transactions that banks flagged as ""potential criminal activity"" to the Treasury Department‚Äôs Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Fox News inquiries sent to Hallie and Hunter‚Äôs lawyer went unreturned.
