1/12/2022,"It was unusually warm on 20 May 2020, with the mercury hitting 26C. The windows of No 10 Downing Street were still displaying rainbows drawn by children in support of the NHS and Boris Johnson had enjoyed an early morning run in shorts and T-shirt. The sunny weather coincided with a retrospectively misplaced sense of optimism inside the building that the worst of Covid was now behind us despite strict national lockdown measures still in place. Five days earlier, staff in a celebratory mood had enjoyed impromptu drinks in the garden of No 10 and inside their offices, with Johnson telling one that they deserved their drink for “beating back the virus”.  In public, cabinet ministers were sternly reminding people not to mix with more than one other person from outside their household. Schools and many businesses remained shut, people were dying alone, and many were suffering terrible loneliness after two months locked down. But according to those working in Downing Street at the time, there was a hopeful feeling at the top of government that the deadly wave of Covid was passing and the country would reopen before long. One insider said it verged on a “saviour complex”, whereby the hard work and sense of having triumphed over the virus divorced those inside the No 10 sanctuary from the reality of rules outside. It was against this backdrop that Martin Reynolds, Johnson’s principal private secretary, emailed more than 100 colleagues working in No 10 asking them to “join us” for a “bring your own booze” party later that day from 6pm. “After what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening,” he said. About 40 staffers attended the event, with long tables laid out in the garden with crisps, crudités and sausage rolls. “It was picnic stuff in plastic boxes, I think, not much ceremony,” one said. But the alcohol was flowing freely and people were “boozing”, they added. The prime minister, recently recovered from a spell in hospital with Covid, went along with his soon-to-be wife, Carrie, who had recently given birth to their son, Wilfred. At the time, several of those working in the building knew it was an ill-judged move and chose not to go, with one calling the idea of the gathering “absolutely mental”. Another person who claims to have raised the alarm is Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s senior adviser at the time, whose lockdown-busting travels were revealed by the Guardian and Daily Mirror two days later. A fortnight on, he appeared in the same No 10 garden to defend himself against accusations he broke the rules. Another No 10 source told the Guardian they also mentioned at the time that the 20 May party was not advisable. Former civil servants remarked on how unusual the Reynolds invite appeared to be, coming from a senior official. No 10 has declined to answer any questions about whether the gathering was sanctioned by Johnson. But staffers said it was not out of character for Reynolds. One former aide said the senior No 10 civil servant – who had previously worked alongside Johnson in the Foreign Office – was well liked by the prime minister. “He’s good at ‘not hearing things’ when the things being said are off-colour. He’s not uptight,” they said. Johnson has so far backed Reynolds to stay in post, while the inquiry into the party by veteran civil servant Sue Gray is ongoing. But there is a widespread feeling in Westminster that he will not survive in his job for long and rumours that Johnson is casting round for possible replacements. Reynolds, the former ambassador to Libya, is rumoured to be heading back to the diplomatic service, with one source saying he was keen to return to the Middle East. “Martin [Reynolds] literally sent an invitation to a large-scale party, bring your own booze, which totally breaks the rules; he can’t escape the rap,” one former staffer said. One Whitehall source who spent time in No 10 said they could understand the pressures junior staffers were under during the period. “They worked in the office the whole time when their colleagues were working from home. And you are working on something so important, it gets a bit ‘saviour complex’. You lose touch with how things are perceived.” Another source with knowledge of two No 10 parties later in 2020 said there had been an element of entitlement about the decision to ignore the rules, with a common theme that those working there felt they “deserved” the privilege after all they had been through. A former No 10 aide said this “bubble mentality” when it comes to sticking to the rules – evident from Cummings and his own trips during lockdown, Matt Hancock and his affair with an aide in breach of social distancing rules, and the multiple examples of Downing Street parties – goes a long way to “explain – but not excuse” the goings-on. “It is hard to see Sue Gray accepting this as any sort of mitigation,” they said.",News/Politics,Saviours in bubbles: how No 10 justified its ‘BYOB’ lockdown party,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/11/saviours-in-bubbles-how-no-10-justified-its-byob-lockdown-party
1/12/2022,"The world No 1 was given permission to play in Melbourne by Tennis Australia and the state authorities in Victoria only after providing a document showing he had a positive test for Covid on 16 December. In the eyes of their medical panels – although not the Australian government’s – that made him eligible for a medical exemption, which meant Djokovic did not have to quarantine for 14 days after arriving in Australia.  However on Monday, Der Spiegel claimed that when it scanned the QR code belonging to Djokovic’s PCR test at 1.19pm German time it said: “Test result Negative.” However an hour later, after another scan, it said: “Positive.” Several others – including the New York Times journalist Ben Rothenberg – reported the same findings, with Rothenberg also posting a photo of the two different results. When the Guardian tried on Tuesday it returned universally positive results. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Der Spiegel said it had found an anomaly in the timestamp for the digital version of Djokovic’s positive test which, it claimed, indicated the result may actually be from 26 December and not the 16th. When asked about Djokovic’s PCR test on Monday, his brother Djordje insisted the entire process was public and “all documents are legal”. Djokovic took a PCR test at 1pm on 16 December and received his positive result seven hours later. At the time of his test, Serbia legally required those who had Covid to self-isolate for 14 days or risk a fine. Instead Djokovic attended a ceremony for the unveiling of a stamp in his honour in Belgrade, which he posted about on Twitter, and then also posed with 23 young players at his tennis academy. Meanwhile on 18 December, the French newspaper L’Équipe said he took part in its Champion of Champions awards photo shoot in Belgrade. Djokovic is yet to comment. However when his brother, Djordje, was asked about those public appearances at a media event on Monday he suddenly announced: “This press conference is adjourned at the moment.” When Djokovic’s declaration was filed on 1 January, the answer “no” was ticked to the question: “Have you travelled, or will you travel, in the 14 days prior to your flight to Australia?” However Djokovic flew to Melbourne from Spain on 4 January, having apparently spent the new year in Marbella. On 31 December a social media post also purported to show him participating in an activity with children from the SotoTennis Academy in Cádiz, where he filmed a message. A tweet on Christmas Day from the tennis journalist José Morgado suggests Djokovic was in Belgrade alongside the Serbian handball player Petar Djordjic, in an image taken from the latter’s Instagram on the same day. A video of him playing tennis from a different account was posted on the same day and deleted on Tuesday. In an affidavit Djokovic submitted to the court, he said he “authorised” his agent to submit the travel declaration form although among the documents he also suggested it was Tennis Australia. In his interview with border officials, he seemed to credit it at different times to the Australian government and his agent or manager. The form states that “giving false and misleading information is a serious offence. You may also be liable to a civil penalty for giving false or misleading information.” Border officials also may have questions to answer, however. Serbia is not in the EU, but Spain is in the Schengen zone so if Djokovic had travelled, there should have been a stamp in his passport showing the date of his arrival in Spain. Tennis Australia’s chief executive, Craig Tiley, said last week the potential reasons for medical exemptions from vaccination to play in the tournament included previous adverse response to vaccines, recent major surgery or myocarditis or certified evidence of a Covid infection in the previous six months. However the deadline for applying for a medical exemption from vaccination to compete at the Australian Open was 10 December — six days before Djokovic’s positive test result. Yet on 30 December it allowed the Serb to play. So why did the authorities appear to bend their own rules? On the face of it, Djokovic appeared likely to sit out a tournament he has won a record nine times until he caught Covid on 16 December – which suddenly satisfied Tennis Australia and the Victorian authorities that he deserved a medical exemption. But would the world No 1 really have spurned the chance to win a men’s record-breaking 21st grand slam in Melbourne if he had not gotten ill? Djokovic practised again on Tuesday while he awaited the decision of Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, who could yet revoke his visa for a second time using powers granted to him by Australia’s Migration Act. That decision is now likely to be on Wednesday at the earliest.",Sport/Sport,Q&A: the key questions that are still to be answered in Djokovic saga,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/11/qa-the-key-questions-that-are-still-to-be-answered-from-djokovic-saga
1/12/2022,"The alleged parties hosted in Downing Street during lockdown have sparked a mix of horror, fury and cynical humour since the first reports emerged late last year. Every few days, a new piece of evidence has emerged, each more damning than the last and providing more fodder for outrage, dismay and humour on social media.The latest development, on the leak of an email inviting more than 100 Downing Street staff to a “bring your own booze” party during lockdown in May 2020, spawned tens of thousands of comments.On the trending #DowningStreetParties hashtag, one doctor whose tweet has gone viral recalled how she had to wear uncomfortable, sweaty PPE as she watched people die in May 2020, and had been left with post-traumatic stress disorder. May 2020. 9 weeks away from home. Trying to save lives. And they partied??I baked in these suits. I wept. I was isolated. We rationed PPE. We watched people die. I developed PTSD. We couldn’t even get a second phone line for the ward. AND THEY PARTIED???? #DowningStreetParties pic.twitter.com/leNfJAE8nb  Author Michael Rosen combined pathos and humour, ironically quipping “damn, I missed it” of the party – he was in a coma at the time due to coronavirus. May 20 2020 Number 10 party. Damn, I missed it. I was in a coma. Just my luck. Many commenters reflected on being unable to see relatives, including those who would later die of Covid, in May 2020. Some recalled saying goodbye to dying relatives over Zoom or FaceTime. On 20 May 2020 my baby brother was in ICU. He died on 23rd May. We couldn’t sit with him until they switched off his life support. My dad and I watched him take his last breaths over FaceTime. The words I want to use right now would get me kicked off Twitter #DowningStreetParties One commenter shared an image of her dad followed by a picture of a coffin, and said she had been unable to see her father in the 37 days between the photos “because I followed the rules set out by our prime minister”. These are the last 2 moments I spent with my dad. I didn’t see him at all in the 37 days between the 2 photos because I followed the rules set out by our Prime Minister. Rules he systematically & repeatedly broke for no good reason. #COVID19 #DowningStreetParties #JohnsonOut pic.twitter.com/poVjjCE6Ef Some shared pictures of empty public spaces, such as parks where police had broken up gatherings of more than two people from different households, or empty play parks where children were banned. Several commenters referenced Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore, who were fined by police for taking two warm drinks on a socially distanced walk in Derbyshire during the third lockdown last January on the grounds it was an “illegal picnic”. Photo of my local park taken in June 2020. The kids weren’t even allowed to play outside in a play park while these shits had a party #DowningStreetParties pic.twitter.com/biPiGtUXkh Some noted how challenging the early lockdowns had been for those living in small spaces without a balcony or garden, given rules in the first lockdown had prevented people from sitting down outside in public places. I lived in a small 3rd floor flat with no balcony or garden and wasn’t even allowed to sit on a park bench out side. It was so hot inside it was almost unbearable , we had to keep the curtains closed all day. Meanwhile, they were enjoying the weather at #DowningStreetParties Other commentators opted to seek comfort from the unhappy lockdown memories in gallows humour, likening festival scenes to the Downing Street party. The morning after the Downing Street party. pic.twitter.com/L8bFqlUEKv One commenter speculated that perhaps the prime minister’s feeble clap for the NHS had been due to a hangover from the party, which he has not denied attending. Only clapped the NHS for 11 seconds but to be fair, he had a hangover from the party the night before. #BYOB #BringYourOwnBooze #DowningStreetParties #downingstparty #BorisResign #BorisTheLiar #BorisJohnsonMustGo #BorisJohnsonOut https://t.co/wE7lg2jLNa There was much scepticism on social media over whether anyone would be held to account. One commentator referenced the allegations that the Metropolitan police have been accused of “deferring to the powerful” by not investigating the parties with an apt reference to Chief Wiggum, the bumbling and incompetent police chief in The Simpsons. Pictured: The Met Police now being forced to investigate the #DowningStreetParties pic.twitter.com/CxACNTWKCw And some recommended the public channel their anger at the Conservatives into their voting intentions.

1/12/2022,"Good morning. The world is waiting for news from Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, who has yet to decide the fate of Novak Djokovic. Covid is sweeping across Europe as health officials in Australia call for stronger public health messaging about ventilation. Djokovic has been training with his coach in Melbourneas he awaits a verdict from Hawke. Australian Border Force is investigating whether he incorrectly declared he had not travelled for two weeks before his flight to Australia, despite social media posts showing him in Belgrade before flying out of Spain. The fiasco reveals a much larger problem with Australia’s borders, writes Ben Doherty. “In its incompetent handling of Djokovic’s case, the Australian government has exposed not just one bizarre case, but systemic, structural flaws in the way Australia treats those who arrive on its shores.” Other tennis stars are now speaking out about the situation, with Andy Murray suggesting Djokovic has questions to answer, and Marton Fucsovics saying: “I don’t think Novak has the right to be here.”  Australia needs to improve its public health focus on air quality, rather than hand hygiene, to combat the spread of Covid, experts say. Health officials are calling for the government to implement an air safety campaign and set standards for safe indoor air as awareness of viral airborne transmission lags behind previous messaging. But physical distancing and mask-wearing may still be the most effective prevention methods after a new study suggests the virus loses 90% of its ability to infect us within five minutes of becoming airborne. So is it time to consider switching your reusuable mask for a respirator? Australia’s promised supplies of 51m doses of the Novavax vaccine may be approved within months after the company finally completed its approval applications with the health department. The WHO is warning Omicron could infect half of Europe’s population within the next two months if immediate action isn’t taken. The region recorded more than 7 million new cases in the first week of 2022. Hans Kluge, the WHO’s Europe director, said while vaccines provided “good protection” against severe disease and death, rising hospital admissions were “challenging health systems” and it was too soon to start treating the coronavirus as an endemic illness. Covid-related staff shortages in the disability sector are leaving some people without access to vital services and anger is brewing among providers who say they’ve been left to compete for rapid antigen tests with other businesses and the general public. A Labor government will commit up to $200m a year from the $4.7bn emergency response fund to disaster prevention and resilience, including measures such as flood levees, sea walls and cyclone shelters. Labor accused the Morrison government of sitting on the emergency respond fund, which had “done nothing to help” prepare the country for natural disasters. Farmers have committed to work with traditional owners after land in the Liverpool Plains of NSW has been bought back by local farming families. Gomeroi traditional custodians were still seeking assurances that their sacred places were safe and accessible to Indigenous people. Santos has been accused of failing Indigenous groups and treating one of the country’s biggest landholders with a “cavalier attitude” as it faces court action over a proposed expansion of its fracking operations in the Beetaloo Basin. Queensland police officers have been cleared of wrongdoing in the death of an Indigenous man in custody but a Queensland coroner wants the state’s police force review the use of a controversial neck hold which was used to restrain the man before he died of a heart attack. Protesters have gathered in Fayetteville, North Carolina, for a second night in a row after a Black man was killed by an off-duty sheriff’s deputy. The deputy told authorities Jason Walker, 37, had jumped on to his vehicle. The UK’s Metropolitan police have been accused of “deferring to the powerful” by not investigating Downing Street parties held in apparent breach of lockdown rules. Germany’s climate minister has called for cuts to carbon emissions to be trebled, arguing the country faced a race against time and required a “massive national debate” to achieve his ministry’s goals. Almost two decades after The OC first hit the screen, the glossy teen show is well worth a rewatch, writes Nathan Jolly. “The OC was one of those lightning-in-a-bottle shows, intended by its creators to be a cross between The Karate Kid and 90210 … Best of all, The OC was ridiculous, and knew it. The show was filled with self-knowing winks, wry references to its own craziness, and never painted its faulted characters as entirely aspirational – despite how many pool-houses and ponies they possessed.” Michael Sun grew up in a household eating copious amounts of chilli at every mealtime: heapings of chopped bird’s eye on eggs, extremely liberal lashings of Tabasco in popcorn, huge dollops of hot sauce consumed straight from the spoon. Sun shares this 10-minute chilli oil recipe that suits everything from toasties to tofu and spoonfuls straight in your gob. “Does too much of this chilli oil make my stomach ache with an intense burning sensation as I lay awake at 3am? Yes. Will I continue making it and then overindulging anyway? Also yes,” Sun says. In our weekly interview about objects, Rhys Nicholson talks cooking, heirlooms and airport mishaps. “A few years ago, I was heading to the airport in Auckland at 6am and realised I didn’t have my passport with me,” the comedian says. “I was coming back to Australia and was going to land and go straight to shows. It was too late to cancel them and my agent was calling people in a panic. It was the most useless I’ve ever felt in my life.” When released from prison, Darko Desic faces deportation to a country that no longer exists.

1/12/2022,"The BBC opposes so-called “cancel culture” and will actively provide a platform for individuals with contrary viewpoints, according to the man who enforces its editorial standards. David Jordan, the BBC’s director of editorial policy, said the broadcaster should “represent all points of view” and wanted to see a belief in impartiality triumph over identity.  “We are very committed to ensuring that viewpoints are heard from all different sorts of perspectives and we don’t subscribe to the ‘cancel culture’ that some groups would put forward,” he said. Jordan said everyone should expect their views to be appropriately represented by the national broadcaster – even if they believe the Earth is flat. “It’s critical to the BBC that we represent all points of view and give them due weight,” he said. “Flat-earthers are not going to get as much space as people who believe the Earth is round, but very occasionally it might be appropriate to interview a flat-earther. And if a lot of people believed in flat Earth we’d need to address it more.” Asked about issues such as transgender rights, Jordan told the House of Lords communications committee that impartiality should triumph over personal identity. He criticised the New York Times for some of its editorial choices in this area and said individual BBC staff should not be able to veto coverage. “Whether or not some members of our staff like it is not the point. They leave their prejudices at the door … they need to be prepared to hear viewpoints they might personally disagree with. It’s our job to get those viewpoints proportionately viewed on the BBC,” Jordan said. Tim Davie, the director general, is attempting to put impartiality at the centre of his pitch for the future of the corporation’s news division and has already cracked down on social media use and announced ongoing impartiality reviews. However, the corporation is currently dealing with internal staff battles over its approach to covering topics such as politics, race and gender self-identification with wider questions about who gets to define impartiality. Davie said he was aware of staff concerns that the focus on impartiality could leave BBC journalists reluctant to take risks and make bold editorial decisions. He also accepted that the BBC’s understanding of where it needs to change its editorial approach is often shaped by external forces. “We are beasts of the wider world. If we’re sensing there is genuine concern about an area or we’re getting more complaints in an area, that will help inform our decisions about where we want to focus our internal reviews,” Davie said.",News/Media,"BBC does not subscribe to ‘cancel culture’, says director of editorial policy",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/11/bbc-does-not-subscribe-to-cancel-culture-says-director-of-editorial-policy
1/12/2022,"Chopping onions is a recurring kitchen nightmare that often reduces home cooks to tears, but red eyes could be a thing of the past as “tearless” onions go on sale in the UK for the first time. Next week Waitrose will start selling Sunions in its stores, a “brown, tearless and sweet” onion variety that is being billed as a “gamechanger” for red-eyed chefs. The onions, which are being marketed using the strapline “not a single tear”, have taken more than 30 years to perfect.  The irritation caused by the vapours released when chopping into an onion means that every day, Britons go to great lengths to take away the sob factor at meal times. The hacks used include sticking onions in the freezer first, soaking them in water, or even wearing swimming goggles. Indeed, Waitrose’s sister chain, John Lewis, sells special “onion goggles” with anti-fog lenses for £23 to get the job done. However, onion goggles could soon be obsolete thanks to Sunions, which Waitrose says are “perfect for those with sensitive eyes as well as cooking in the kitchen with children”. With the vegetable a staple of many dishes, Paul Bidwell, the supermarket’s onion buyer, said Sunions would be a versatile ingredient. The “sweetness of this type of onion lends itself perfectly to a variety of dishes, from salads to hot meals”, he said. However, at a time when food bills are going up anyway, Sunions may yet make your eyes water, as they are a lot more expensive than regular onions. A three-pack of Sunions costs £1.50 – or 50p an onion. That is three times as much as Waitrose’s cheapest own-brand onions, which are 14p each. The race to develop a tearless onion has been a long one, with scientists around the world working on prototypes for decades. Sunions were launched in the US four years ago. They reached mainland Europe last year when the brand was picked up by a number of Spanish retailers. The onion was originally developed by the agricultural giant Bayer, but is now owned by the chemicals firm BASF, which acquired part of its seeds and crop business. It says Sunions are not genetically modified but the product of decades of cross-breeding of less pungent strains of onion. On the brand’s website it says that, unlike all other onions, they “become sweeter every day”. “Volatile compounds in onions are responsible for tearing and pungent flavour and the amounts of those compounds in other onions remain the same or increase over time. In Sunions, these compounds do the exact opposite and decrease to create a tearless, sweet and mild onion.”",News/Business,No goggles required: ‘Tearless’ onions go on sale in UK supermarkets,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/11/no-goggles-required-tearless-onions-go-on-sale-in-uk-supermarkets
1/12/2022,"Two of the world’s largest private equity firms are teaming up to bid for Boots, which is expected to be sold by its US owner this year for an estimated £10bn. The US group Bain Capital, which recently bought the bakery chain Gail’s and made a doomed bid for the British insurer LV= last year, is understood to have teamed up with UK-based CVC Capital. A one-time owner of the failed department store chain Debenhams, CVC now owns the Moto service station group, the RAC and the luxury watchmaker Breitling.  Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the US health group that has owned a stake in the UK’s dominant pharmacy chain since 2012, is considering a potential sale this year. Estimates on the price range from £5bn to £12bn. Any bid involving CVC and Bain is likely to mean a key role for Dominic Murphy, the CVC managing partner who currently sits on the WBA board. Murphy is likely to have to recuse himself from board discussions about the sale. His association with Boots dates back to 2007, when he teamed up with the Italian billionaire Stefano Pessina to take the chemist private. Then working for the private equity group KKR, Murphy helped negotiate an £11bn takeover of Alliance Boots, which had been formed by the merger of Pessina’s Alliance Unichem and Boots only the year before. The pair then brought about the even bigger merger with WBA, where Pessina is currently chairman. KKR retained a stake in Boots until 2016, and in 2019 the firm approached Walgreens about a buyout of the whole group, but a deal could not be agreed. Bain is thought to be interested in developing Boots’s online beauty and healthcare services, according to Sky News, which first reported CVC’s potential tie-up with the US private equity group. Other large private equity firms expected to consider a tilt at Boots include Apollo Global Management and Majestic Wine’s majority owner, Fortress Investment Group, which both missed out on the buyout of the British supermarket Morrisons last year. Apollo also attempted to buy Asda in 2020. British retail assets are seen as ripe for private equity investment as lack of certainty about winners and losers in a fast-changing consumer environment is prompting owners to sell up or seek new funds. A WBA statement said: “We can confirm that Walgreens Boots Alliance … has announced a strategic review, primarily focused on our successful Boots business. “This strategic review is at an exploratory stage and further announcements will be made in due course.” Any auction process is not expected to kick off until summer. However, the company previously said in a statement that Walgreens had “a renewed set of priorities and strategic direction for the group” that included “a more pointed focus on North America and on healthcare”. A stock market listing for the Nottingham-based retailer and pharmacist, which has more than 2,000 outlets and employs about 55,000 people, may also be on the cards as an alternative to a private sale. Boots has had a tough time in recent years as it has struggled to deal with a huge ageing store portfolio and difficulties in taking its brands worldwide even before the pandemic. In 2017, WBA sold off the Boots manufacturing business to the France-based specialist Fareva, including the Nottingham factory that it opened in the 1930s. In 2019, Boots said it would close up to 200 stores over two years. While the group, as an essential retailer, was able to trade during the recent high street lockdowns, its stores suffered from low visitor numbers while neighbouring businesses remained closed. Trading bounced back last year, with sales at established pharmacy counters up almost 9% in the three months to 30 November, while sales across the rest of its product ranges rose more than 16%. Online sales have almost doubled on pre-pandemic levels to account for 15% of the total. Boots, which was founded by the Quaker John Boot in 1849, has been in private hands since 2007, the year after it teamed up with Alliance Unichem, handing control to Pessina.",News/Business,Private equity firms Bain and CVC join forces for potential Boots bid,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/11/private-equity-firms-bain-cvc-join-forces-potential-boots-bid
1/12/2022,"The fight over voting rights in the US has arrived at a hugely consequential juncture. After watching Republicans ram through state bills that impose new voting restrictions, Joe Biden and Democrats in the Senate are set to make their most aggressive effort yet to push back.  Later this week, the Senate will vote on legislation that would amount to the most significant expansion of voting rights protections since the civil rights era. Here’s a look at how the fight over voting rights has unfolded over the last year: All of the data from the 2020 election points to it being one one of the most successful in American history. About two-thirds of eligible voters – 158 million people – cast a ballot, a record turnout. About a week after the election, a coalition of experts, including a top official in Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security, described the election as “the most secure in American history”. Nonetheless, Republican state lawmakers fueled an unprecedented surge of legislation to impose new restrictions on voting. In total, more than 440 bills that included measures to restrict voting access were introduced in 49 states in 2021, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Thirty-four of those bills became law in 19 states. Many of the measures impose restrictions on mail-in voting, which was used in unprecedented numbers in 2020 amid the Covid pandemic. Republicans in Florida and Georgia, for example, limited or prohibited the use of mail-in ballot drop boxes, widely used in 2020 to ensure ballots made it back to election offices in time. Some states also imposed new identification requirements for voters both when they request and return a ballot, despite no evidence of widespread fraud. Lawmakers in Georgia passed measures that prohibit providing food or water to people standing in line to vote. Republicans have also taken up measures to exert control over who runs elections and counts. Election administration in the US has long been seen as a non-partisan job run by under-the-radar officials. But experts are concerned this new trend, which some call election subversion, could lead to partisan meddling. Even though voter fraud is virtually non-existent, Republicans say their measures are needed to shore up confidence in elections. Polling shows significant numbers of Americans do not trust the results of the 2020 election. A recent UMass Amherst poll, for example, found that 33% do not believe the election was legitimate. That thinking belies reality. Much of the shaken confidence is because Trump continues to claim without evidence that the election was rigged. The Republican party has embraced his claims, ostracizing dissenters. Republicans also point to polling showing that voter ID is broadly supported, and to record high turnout as evidence voter suppression isn’t really a problem. Voting rights groups point out that while turnout was up in 2020, there are still persistent gaps between white and non-white voters. About 70.9% of white voters cast a ballot in 2020, compared with 58.4% of non-white, according to the Brennan Center. In Georgia, lawmakers have defended the ban on providing food and water to people in line by saying it’s needed to prevent unlawful electioneering. It’s not clear that new restrictions will benefit the GOP. A study from March 2021 found that vote-by-mail neither boosted turnout nor helped Democrats. That said, there is still deep concern that Republicans appear to be pushing restrictions in response to an election where more Americans than ever, including a high numbers of non-white people, cast a ballot. Republicans could benefit significantly from efforts to take over election administration. Election officials often wield tremendous power to set rules. The Democratic response is built around two pieces of federal legislation. One measure is the Freedom to Vote Act, which would overhaul rules for federal elections and set an expansive baseline for voter access. States would be required to offer 15 days of early voting, same-day voter registration and ballot drop boxes, among other measures. It also would prevent the removal without cause of elections officials. The second bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, would restore a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, requiring places where there is repeated evidence of recent voting discrimination to get changes to elections approved by the federal government. The US supreme court gutted a similar requirement in 2013. The filibuster is a longstanding rule in the Senate. It requires 60 votes to move legislation to a final vote. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats but Democrats control it via Vice-President Kamala Harris’s casting vote. Because there are not 10 Republicans who support the voting rights bills, Democrats have been unable to move either. There has been growing criticism of the filibuster from Democrats, who say Republicans have weaponized it into a tool of obstruction. Democrats can change the filibuster with a majority vote. The problem is that two Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, staunchly support leaving the filibuster in place. They say it is an important way to forge bipartisanship. And they argue that getting rid of the rule would allow Republicans, when back in control, to exert unlimited power. There have been aggressive negotiations to get both senators to support tweaking but not eliminating the filibuster. Ideas for such changes include requiring senators to actually talk on the floor of the Senate to hold up legislation, or to require 41 senators to actively show up to block a vote, instead of requiring 60 votes to advance. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, has pledged a vote on changes to the filibuster this week. It’s unclear what changes, if any, Manchin and Sinema support.",News/US news,Why are US voting rights under threat and how is the filibuster related?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/11/us-voting-rights-explainer-filibuster-republicans-democrats-senate
1/12/2022,"A cross-party group of MPs has delivered a scathing attack on a “shambolic” and “appalling” appointments process in which a successful candidate to chair the charities watchdog resigned just days before he was due to take up the job, amid reports about his conduct in a previous role. In a lengthy hearing on Tuesday morning, the digital, culture, media and sport select committee grilled senior civil servants over the “debacle” in which Martin Thomas was approved as Charity Commission chair by MPs in December, then quit soon afterwards when press reports that he had faced allegations of misconduct surfaced.  MPs said they were incredulous that the appointments system had not picked up an allegation that Thomas had been found to have acted inappropriately while previously the chair of a woman’s charity, despite the charity formally reporting the incident to the regulator. The committee chair, Julian Knight, compared the failure to successfully appoint a chair of the Charity Commission to delays and rows that have dogged the appointment of a new chair of the media regulator, Ofsted. Both roles have been unfilled for nearly a year. “By our viewpoint, what we have seen is a complete shambles in terms of appointments that are in the purview of this committee. They are huge appointments to the good of this country and they have been handled in a way that this committee is actually flabbergasted to the degree to which there have been such failings. “The British civil service used to be called a Rolls-Royce, didn’t it. When politicians were making mistakes the civil servant would pick up the pieces and glide the country through thick and thin. Is it more of a Reliant Robin now, rather than a Rolls-Royce?” The government is continuing to seek a new head of Ofcom after the former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre unexpectedly pulled out of the running in November after concerns were raised about the transparency of the recruitment process. The Ofcom role was advertised last February. Senior Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport civil servants, who oversaw the Charity Commission appointment, admitted to the committee that as a matter of departmental policy they had not taken up references for Thomas, and nor had they checked Thomas’s track record as chair of 14 charities with the commission. The committee also tore into the commissioner for public appointments, William Shawcross, after he at first refused to comment to the committee on the Charity Commission chair appointment because he was carrying out an inquiry into it, and then said he “did not think the DCMS was to blame” for the failure to appoint. John Nicolson MP told a visibly discomforted Shawcross he had effectively told the entire committee his decision before he had even started his inquiry. “Can you imagine the judge in a court saying before the trial begins: ‘Of course the defendant is clearly innocent, but I’m not pre-judging in any way, let’s proceed’?” Sarah Healey, the permanent secretary at the DCMS, denied the Charity Commission appointments process had been a failure, saying it had been carried out in line with official guidance. She defended not taking references from previous employers and said Thomas himself should have highlighted the incident to his interviewers. Thomas has said he left the charity in question, Women for Women International, in the summer and was unaware when he subsequently applied for the £62,000 a year Charity Commission role that a formal complaint made against him, relating to comments made on a zoom call, had been upheld by the charity. Three other formal complaints made against him had not been upheld, including a 2018 incident in which he mistakenly sent a photo of himself in a lingerie store to a female employee instead of the charity chief executive, whom he was trying to warn against taking a donation from the same lingerie store brand. Healey said ministers had not yet decided whether to re-run the appointments process for the Charity Commission chair post or to appoint from the list of seven candidates previously interviewed for the role and who were assessed as suitable for ministers to choose from. Knight said: “I’m absolutely astounded that your employer has not spoken to previous employers. You seem to do less checks for a £70bn sector of the UK economy [with] 180,000 charities than, frankly, if you were employing someone to do a paper round.” Healey said Whitehall departments each had different policies on whether to take up references, which could be a time-consuming process and often did not add much value other than to confirm the dates of a person’s previous employment.",News/Society,‘Shambles’: MPs attack appointment of Charity Commission chair,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/11/shambles-mps-attack-appointment-of-charity-commission-chair
