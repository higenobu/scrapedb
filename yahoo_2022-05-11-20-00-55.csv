5/11/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The rout in stocks isn’t over just yet, according to Morgan Stanley strategists, who see scope for both US and European equities to correct further amid mounting concerns of slowing growth.

According to his base scenario of “fire and ice,” he expects the S&P 500 to slide in the near term before climbing to 3,900 points next spring--which is about 2.5% below current levels--on slowing earnings growth and elevated volatility. “We continue to believe that the US equity market is not priced for this slowdown in growth from current levels,” Wilson said in a note on Tuesday. “We expect equity volatility to remain elevated over the next 12 months.” He recommends defensive positioning with an overweight in health care, utilities and real estate stocks. The call from one of Wall Street’s most vocal bears is in sharp contrast to some strategists including Peter Oppenheimer at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., who said on Tuesday that the powerful selloff in stocks in the past weeks has created buying opportunities, with headwinds such as inflation and hawkish central banks already priced in. After capping their longest streak of weekly losses since 2011 last week, US equities bounced slightly on Tuesday and futures pointed to more gains today ahead of a key inflation report. READ: Goldman’s Oppenheimer Sees Value in $11 Trillion Stock Rout Over in Europe, Morgan Stanley’s Graham Secker is also staying cautious on the region’s equities and expects them to drop further given the challenging economic situation, the war in Ukraine and the risk of earnings downgrades in the second half of the year from falling margins. “Let’s keep it simple – the macro backdrop is very difficult for stocks,” Secker said in a note on Wednesday, adding that a reduction in Russian gas imports was the biggest bear case risk. “Although investor sentiment is low and equity valuations are reasonable, the difficult fundamental outlook is likely to drive stocks lower over the coming months.” Secker cut his rating on European mining and construction and materials stocks to neutral and said it was “too soon” to add cyclical exposure back into portfolios, while lifting food, beverage and tobacco shares to neutral. Morgan Stanley strategists are overweight the FTSE 100 and prefer defensives over cyclicals, staying overweight value shares versus growth with a defensive tilt. Strategists at Barclays Plc also said market action in Europe is turning more defensive on slowing growth and more hawkish monetary policy.

5/11/2022,"Many retirees plan to earn extra income to supplement their retirement spending. But how much can a retired person earn without paying taxes?

The Social Security benefits you receive can be taxable if 50% of your benefits, plus all of your other income, is greater than the specific limits for your filing status. These amounts are as follows: Single filers, qualifying widowers and heads of households bringing in more than $25,000, based on the math above, may have to pay taxes on their Social Security benefits. Married couples filing separately that have lived apart for an entire year who bring in more than $25,000, based on the math above, may have to pay taxes on their Social Security benefits. A married couple filing jointly bringing in more than $32,000, based on the math above, may have to pay taxes on their Social Security benefits. With that, the benefits you receive may or may not be taxable based on your other income. For example, let's say that you are a single filer that received $20,000 in Social Security benefits. Additionally, you earned $20,000 at a part-time job. When you run the numbers, 50% of your benefits plus your other income would be $30,000. With that, Uncle Sam would require you to pay federal taxes on a portion of your Social Security benefits. As another example, let's say a married couple filing jointly receives Social Security benefits of $20,000. You also bring in $20,000 through other sources. With that, 50% of your benefits plus your other income would be $30,000. That's less than the base amount for married couples filing jointly. So, you wouldn't have to pay federal income tax on any of your Social Security benefits. Take the time to run the numbers on your unique situation to find out how much you can earn before you are taxed on that income. If a portion of your Social Security benefit is taxable, there's no avoiding the federal income tax. But you won't pay taxes based on your entire Social Security benefit. Instead, you will pay taxes on 50% or 85% of your total Social Security amount. If you're a single filer with an income between $25,001 and $34,000, you'll pay taxes on 50% of your Social Security benefits. But as a single filer who has a total income of more than $34,000, you'll pay taxes on 85% of your Social Security benefits. Married couples filing jointly with an income between $32,001 and $44,000, you'll pay taxes on 50% of your Social Security benefits. But as a married couple filing jointly that has a total income of more than $44,000, you'll pay taxes on 85% of your Social Security benefits. Exceptions to This Rule Every rule has an exception. In this case, filers in certain states need to be aware of their state's tax requirements. There are 12 states that tax Social Security benefits. These include Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and West Virginia. However, almost every one of these states allows for some kind of deduction, credit or income limit to minimize the tax burden at a state level. New Mexico doesn't provide a way to minimize the burden. Instead, you'll pay state taxes on all of the Social Security income taxed at a federal level. Filing your taxes is often an unwelcome chore. In some cases, there may be a point in your golden years when you can stop filing and paying taxes altogether. So how much can a retired person earn without paying taxes or even filing their taxes? For retirees 65 and older, here's when you can stop filing taxes: Single retirees who earn less than $14,250 Married retirees filing jointly, who earn less than $26,450 if one spouse is 65 or older or who earn less than $27,800 if both spouses are age 65 or older Married retirees filing separately who earn less than $5 Retired heads of household age who earned less than $20,500 Retired qualifying widowers who earned less than $26,450 For those with an income below the listed thresholds, you may not have to pay taxes. But even if you don't have to file your taxes, it's usually your best interest to file anyways. That's because you might qualify for a tax return, which could represent a big boost for your budget. If you aren't sure whether or not you can stop filing taxes, the IRS has a helpful tool to help you find out. But talk to a financial advisor before deciding to skip filing your taxes. It could mean missing potential benefits. Retirement can be expensive. But depending on your income, you may be able to save on tax costs. It is possible to earn money during retirement and not have to pay taxes on the earnings. Just be aware of what the limits are, given your own situation. Also, check in with the tax code changes regularly because there are frequent changes to the rules. Consider working with a financial advisor as you coordinate your earnings with your tax planning. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard.
