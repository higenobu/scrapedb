Velodyne is one of several startups that have gone public in the past two years by merging with so-called blank check companies, known as special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Months after that transaction, investor Ford Motor Co. disclosed that it had sold off its stake in Velodyne, though it was still using the company’s technology. Through the close of regular trading Monday, the stock had slumped 84% over the past year as the frenzy over SPACs has worn off.
