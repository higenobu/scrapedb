5/5/2022,"The Federal Reserve moved to tamp down soaring inflation in the US on Wednesday, announcing the sharpest rise in interest rates in over 20 years. The Fed’s benchmark interest rate was raised by 0.5 percentage points to a target rate range of between 0.75% and 1%. The hike is the largest since 2000 and follows a 0.25 percentage point increase in March, the first increase since December 2018. More rate rises are expected. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Fed to raise rates seven times in 2022, reaching 2.9% in early 2023. Starting in June, officials also plan to shrink their $9tn asset portfolio, a policy move that will further push up borrowing costs. In a statement the Fed said that although “overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment remained strong”. But it warned that inflation “remains elevated,” the invasion of Ukraine had implications for the US economy that remain “highly uncertain” and Covid-related lockdowns in China “are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions”. Rates were cut to near zero in March 2020 when the pandemic hit the US but they were already low and years of low rates left the US and other countries ill-prepared for a sudden rise in inflation. Until recently the Fed had dismissed rising prices as “transitory” and expected them to fall as economies recovered from the pandemic. All that has now changed. Making the case for sharper rate raises last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said: “It’s absolutely essential to restore price stability. Economies don’t work without price stability.” Thanks in large part to the unprecedented impact of the coronavirus on the global economy, inflation is now running at a 40-year high in the US. In March, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 8.5% higher than it was a year ago, driven up by rising prices for gasoline, shelter, and food. The increasing costs of essential goods and services are now outstripping average wage gains. Ahead of the announcement Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan Chase chief executive officer, warned that the Fed may have waited too long to raise rates. “We’re a little late,” he told Bloomberg. “The sooner they move the better.” The impact of the Fed’s policy is already being felt in the wider economy. Since the start of the year, mortgage rates have climbed at their fastest pace in decades, rising nearly two percentage points. Some hot property markets have started to cool as a result. The impact of tighter monetary policy has also triggered selloffs in the stock markets. Powell will give details about the Fed’s decision at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon.

5/5/2022,"Ocado shareholders have rebelled against high pay for directors at the online grocery specialist, with almost two-fifths voting against a plan to pay the chief executive, Tim Steiner, up to £100m over the next five years. Just over 29% of voting shareholders rejected the company’s overall remuneration policy and almost a similar proportion voted against a three-year extension of Ocado’s “value creation plan”, under which Steiner can earn up to £20m a year and other executives up to £5m each. The extension of the scheme to 2027 came after the company missed a share price target that would have triggered a £20m bonus for Steiner in March. Ocado’s share price has fallen by more than two-thirds to about 890p from a peak in January 2021, as the surge in online grocery shopping during the pandemic has rapidly unwound. The scheme, which is linked to the performance of the share price, was announced in 2019 and was originally meant to run for five years until 2024. A significant proportion of the group’s shareholders tried to block the deal in 2020, when 30% voted against it, while about 13% voted against last year. The deal replaced an earlier high-paying plan that also proved controversial. The latest pay proposals had been criticised by the investor advisers Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, and had prompted complaints from Ocado’s leading shareholder Royal London Asset Management (RLAM). RLAM said it had serious concerns about the value creation plan, adding that it was an “example of how poorly designed incentive plans” could “lead to excessive awards for management”. In a statement released after the annual meeting, Ocado said it was nevertheless going ahead with the pay plan. It said the chair of its remuneration committee had undertaken an “extensive programme of engagement with our largest shareholders and representative bodies” in developing pay policy for the next three years. “Many of our largest shareholders understood the strategic rationale for continuing to operate a non-standard, leveraged long-term incentive plan at Ocado and indicated their support for our proposals to extend the scheme beyond its original five-year term,” the company said, adding that investors had recognised the “challenges associated with recruiting internationally and competing for talent within the technology sector”.",News/Business,Ocado investors rebel over £20m-a-year bonus plan for CEO,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/ocado-investors-rebel-pounds-20m-a-year-bonus-plan-ceo
5/5/2022,"This time last year Boohoo had a stock market value of £4bn and seemed to be flying. It was lording it over the high street by buying up its deadwood brands for online rejuvenation; pandemic trading conditions were delivering a whoosh to revenues as the likes of Primark had to close their doors. And now? Two profit warnings later – plus a downbeat outlook statement on Wednesday – Boohoo is full of grumbles. Customers are returning more items, the bane of an online retailer’s life, as they ease out of lockdown joggers and into smarter kit. Freight rates to the US have doubled and delivery times have extended, undermining the economics of selling fast-fashion items to Americans from warehouses in Burnley and Sheffield. The marketing bill has exploded because brands like Debenhams and Karen Millen don’t reinvent themselves. And the backdrop is consumer demand described as “subdued”. Boohoo’s market value has fallen to £1bn and the share price stands at 70p, virtually the lowest it’s been since 2016, a year when annual revenues were £295m, as opposed to the near-£2bn just reported for the last financial period. Whistling cheerfully John Lyttle, the chief executive, reckons Boohoo is “well-positioned to rebound strongly as pandemic-related headwinds ease”. Well, maybe, just don’t expect the bounce to come soon. Top-line profits, having just fallen 28% to £125m, will likely go sideways since margins this year are pencilled in for 4% to 7%, as opposed to 10% that Boohoo used to knock out reliably in the old days. Meanwhile, a mammoth distribution centre has to be constructed in Pennsylvania to solve the US headache. In basic terms, costs are rising and the demand picture is unclear with price rises (probably) on the way. Aside from building some US infrastructure earlier, it’s hard to see what Boohoo should have done differently, but maybe that’s the point: the online clothing game is a fiddly business and requires a lot of things to run perfectly. Over at Primark, which resolutely sticks to fuddy-duddy physical shops, life looks easier. The sense of chaos at Just Eat Takeaway gets worse. Adriaan Nühn, chairman of the supervisory board, quit on the morning of the annual meeting on Wednesday, presumably to avoid a drubbing in the shareholder vote in Amsterdam on his reappointment. Meanwhile, the chief operating officer, Jörg Gerbig, was unexpectedly pulled from the poll while the company investigates a complaint regarding misconduct. The other directors got the necessary majorities to continue, despite the efforts of agitating shareholder Cat Rock Capital, with a 6% stake, to get half of them removed. But a weak endorsement, it is safe to assume, will not clear the air. Step one would be a sale of Grubhub, last year’s calamitous $7.3bn (£5.7bn) purchase in the US that is in large part responsible for the 75% collapse in Just Eat’s share price from its peak. The company has said it is reviewing its options, but, until it finds a workable solution, there’ll be a suspicion of going through the motions. Step two would be exit for Jitse Groen, the Dutch founder who led the acquisition drive that was clearly overambitious. If Just Eat still had its primary listing in London and had not decamped to the Netherlands, one suspects he’d be feeling more heat. The board of every luxury carmaker wishes their firm could be more like Ferrari, so there’s no shame in Aston Martin Lagonda hiring a former boss of the star Italian outfit as its chief executive. Amedeo Felisa, 75, actually retired from Ferrari six years ago but he’s definitely experienced and, since he’s already an Aston Martin non-executive director, should know what he’s walking into. One feature is a demoralised workforce, if Aston Martin’s heavy emphasis on adopting “a more collaborative way of working” is a guide; it read as a hint that the departing Tobias Moers, a former Mercedes-Benz chief who was Lawrence Stroll’s big hire after rescuing Aston Martin two years ago, overdid the hard-driving approach. If so, changing the driver is a risk worth taking. Aston Martin cannot, though, afford detours from here. A desperately needed refinancing looms next year with the aim of reducing the nosebleed rates of interest currently being paid on borrowings that totalled £957m at the end of March. The interest bill could be £195m this year, a legacy of the desperate financial position in 2020. Stroll thinks he’s got the right chief executive this time; he needs to be right.",News/Business,Boohoo tumbles as reality of online clothes shopping hits home | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/may/04/boohoo-tumbles-as-reality-of-online-clothes-shopping-hits-home
5/5/2022,"The Football Association has confirmed it is investigating Crawley Town’s manager, John Yems, after he was alleged to have engaged in racist behaviour at the club. Yems, 62, has been suspended indefinitely from his role at the League Two side since allegations were first made a fortnight ago. He has not commented publicly on the claims but is believed to deny them. According to reports first published in the Daily Mail, Yems presided over a culture of racist abuse. The reports, which have not been independently corroborated by the Guardian, include allegations that Yems:  Referred to players of Asian heritage within the squad as “terrorists, suicide bombers and curry munchers”.  Created a racially segregated dressing room, with white players told “don’t change in the black boys’ room”.  And made racial slurs about black players and players of Asian heritage. The extent of the alleged abuse caused a number of players to complain to the Professional Footballers’ Association, with reports suggesting some also sought counselling because of the effects on their mental health. On Wednesday the FA issued a statement confirming it was investigating Yems’s behaviour. Rule E3 of the governing body’s regulations prevents any participant in the game from using “threatening, abusive, indecent or insulting words or behaviour”, with a breach considered aggravated if it involves a racial component. An FA spokesperson said: “We are aware of allegations made against Crawley Town manager John Yems. We are treating the allegations extremely seriously and are currently conducting an investigation into them. We cannot comment further until that has concluded.” Crawley Town have previously described the accusations levelled against Yems as “serious and credible” and said they would “never tolerate racism or discrimination of any kind”. The club were recently the subject of a takeover, with the new owners – a US-based consortium of cryptocurrency investors – acting to suspend Yems within 24 hours of allegations being put to them by the Daily Mail. Crawley said they would not comment further on the reports pending the outcome of the FA investigation.",Sport/Football,FA to investigate racism allegations against Crawley manager Yems,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/04/fa-to-investigate-racism-allegations-against-crawley-manager-yems
5/5/2022,"José Mourinho has said people forget about the impressive job Brendan Rodgers did in taking Liverpool to the cusp of securing the Premier League title on a tiny budget compared with the one Jürgen Klopp is working with, as his Roma team prepare to take on Leicester for a place in a European final. Rodgers, who worked under Mourinho for three years at Chelsea, takes Leicester to the Stadio Olimpico on Thursday in the Europa Conference League semi-final with the tie finely poised after a 1-1 draw in the first leg. Rodgers can lead the club to their first European final but Mourinho is determined to cap his first season at Roma with a 26th major title. “I always say that there is only one match that I didn’t win, which is the next one,” Mourinho said. “I want to win the next one always. If the next one is a semi-final, even more, because a semi-final gives you the right to play the final … if you are not sacked before the final,” he said, alluding to his dismissal by Tottenham before the Carabao Cup final. “Of course it is not just the next match, it is a special match and of course we want to win the competition.” Of Rodgers, Mourinho said: “Brendan doesn’t surprise me. With Liverpool, people forget what he did with much, much less resources than Liverpool has now. He did amazing and then the Scottish history [with Celtic], people forget because people doesn’t focus much on Scottish Premier League. To win the [FA] Cup with Leicester and even the Community Shield, the stability in the club, the way they play, their recruitment, it is a perfect fit, Leicester and Brendan; very, very good.” Mourinho is adamant a partisan crowd of about 70,000 home fans can spur on his team to victory and Rodgers, whose side prevailed against PSV Eindhoven in the previous round, recognises his players must cope with the atmosphere. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, James Maddison and Jamie Vardy are expected to be fit to start, whereas Roma are without Henrikh Mkhitaryan because of a thigh problem. “It is a very young team playing at this level and we will gain from the experiences,” Rodgers said. “We have also shown that we can complete the task. This is another chapter in the story. “Our main objective is just to keep the story of this club going. Like we did in the FA Cup, we wanted to be the winners for the first time and it’s clearly an objective for us in this competition as well. Can we pick up the club’s first piece of silverware in Europe? Now this is another chapter for us to write in our history.” The Leicester captain, Kasper Schmeichel, dismissed the suggestion that winning the Conference League would not rank as high as winning the Premier League or FA Cup. “I don’t play football to finish fourth, fifth or sixth,” Schmeichel said. “You do it for the occasions where you’re in finals regardless of what competition it is. It’s about winning trophies. Those are the moments that fans and players will look back on, those moments when you got to lift trophies.”",Sport/Football,José Mourinho praises the ‘forgotten’ job Brendan Rodgers did at Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/04/jose-mourinho-praises-the-forgotten-job-brendan-rodgers-did-at-liverpool
5/5/2022,"The Scottish government is facing growing calls to impose buffer zones around abortion clinics amid fears that potential changes to abortion rights in the US are emboldening anti-choice protesters. A leaked US draft supreme court ruling overturning Roe v Wade has sharpened anxieties over delays in implementing the SNP’s 2021 manifesto pledge to support local authorities to establish protest-free zones around clinics. With increasing levels of protests outside hospitals in Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scottish Labour called for an emergency summit to discuss the “urgent” introduction of buffer zones. Similar zones exist in a handful of local authorities in England following a landmark case in Ealing, west London. The first minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, said that “the right of women to decide what happens to our own bodies is a human right” after reports that Roe v Wade, the 1973 case that guaranteed the right to abortion in the US, could be overturned. She tweeted on Tuesday: “Experience tells us that removing the legal right to abortion doesn’t stop abortions happening – it just makes them unsafe and puts the lives of women at much greater risk.” But Back Off Scotland co-founder Lucy Grieve said Sturgeon’s outrage “goes only so far”. “There are real, tangible threats to abortion access in Scotland that are going unchallenged by her government. The women’s health minister, Maree Todd, claims that she wants Scotland to be world leading on women’s healthcare, yet her inaction is emboldening these protesters. If she cannot show courage and legislate on this issue, then she must step aside for somebody that will.” Campaigners and opposition politicians have grown increasingly frustrated by delays, which Sturgeon last month blamed on “legal complexities”, with the Scottish Lib Dem leader, Alex Cole-Hamilton, saying her government had “stalled and dissembled”. Now Scottish Green party MSP Gillian Mackay intends to launch a member’s bill to implement legal restrictions later this month. Calling for an immediate summit of MSPs, healthcare women’s organisations and clinicians, Scottish Labour’s Monica Lennon said: “The Scottish government needs to be more transparent about what the potential legal obstacles are. Maree Todd has said that national legislation is not the answer, but unfortunately these delays have emboldened anti-abortion protests, which have got bigger and more intense in recent months.” Today, anti-abortion protestors at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow made their intentions clear.It’s time that SNP ministers did the same.Email @NicolaSturgeon and @MareeToddMSP and ask them when @scotgov will introduce buffer zone legislation. https://t.co/YADVH0GiPT pic.twitter.com/AqnkoS9VAR On Wednesday, Lennon confronted protesters standing with placards outside the maternity unit of the Queen Elizabeth university hospital (QEUH) in Glasgow. “I respect your right to pray and protest but you can pray at church, you can protest at the parliament, this is a place where women access healthcare,” she said before asking the group if they were aware of the upset they were causing. “This is a very difficult time for many women due to foetal abnormalities, women and girls who’ve been raped, women who are making a choice for their own reasons.” The group insisted “it’s a prayer vigil not a protest” but confirmed they wanted to end abortion care in Scotland. Last month, 76 consultants from the QEUH wrote to Todd calling on her to “show courage” and introduce protest-free “buffer zones” across all clinics providing abortions in Scotland. Lead signatory and consultant paediatric radiologist Dr Greg Irwin said colleagues were “seriously concerned” about the protests, which can be seen and heard by patients on wards in the maternity unit, adding: “We know first-hand how distressing this harassment is for our patients, which makes it infuriating for us as clinical staff to have to pass these groups day in, day out.”",News/UK news,Calls for buffer zones around abortion clinics in Scotland after protests,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/04/calls-for-buffer-zones-around-abortion-clinics-in-scotland-after-protests

Like the Britpop heroes to whom they owe a sonic debt, Pacific Avenue write songs of optimism against a backdrop of despair – when the future is burning, it sure is comforting to look back at how far we have come, and celebrate past, personal glories. Speaking of, the band’s previous single Easy Love just missed inclusion in Triple J’s Hottest 100 last year, polling at #108 after being flogged by the youth broadcaster. But in 2021, the climate was wrong for Pacific Avenue.

For more: Pacific Avenue tour nationally in June with Unearthed winners The Rions. For fans of: Julee Cruise, The Cocteau Twins, The Clouds It’s all about the guitars on Jodi Phillis’ haunting new single. Rarely have washes of reverb and tremolo been used to conjure such an unsettling landscape as Phillis unpacks the deceit of an unnamed lover over ripples of cascading chorus, lonely cowboy fingerpicking, and warped single notes. Every note in the sparse arrangement seems thoughtful. This is a complete mood piece, the likes of which Lana Del Rey would kill for. Phillis is a legendary figure in the Australian music scene, fronting The Clouds in the late 80s/early 90s before moving on to a more serene solo career. If this stunning single is any indication, Phillis’ best work may be on the way. For more: Phillis’ sixth solo album We Need To Be Free is out 10 June. For fans of: Silverchair, Björk, Brian Wilson Daniel Johns was originally meant to release his long-awaited solo album on April Fools’ Day, a date that was a little too on-the-nose for an artist well known for long periods of hibernation. He ultimately pushed the date back three weeks in order to facilitate this last-minute collaboration with the legendary composer/producer Van Dyke Parks, the eccentric genius who draped Silverchair’s Diorama in strings and gave Johns the nickname “Young Modern”. It’s a good thing he did, for this stunning pocket symphony is the highlight of Johns’ new album FutureNever. Emergency Calls Only is the sonic and emotional sequel to the pair’s epic Tuna In The Brine and is every bit as flooring as its predecessor. Johns uses his falsetto to devastating effect as Parks provides Disney-fied strings that swoop and swell. This is a beautiful piece of music. For more: FutureNever is out now. For fans of: Pusha T, Watch The Throne, Baby Keem “Sounds so soulful, don’t you agree?” Jay-Z famously declared as Kanye chopped an Otis Redding sample. Rising Indigenous artist Keith Tasman was clearly listening, echoing this same question after vamping alongside a soul sample in this hard-slapping collaboration. After a verse of pure spitfire in which Keith somehow manages to sound menacing while also referencing the Powerpuff Girls, the track warps into another sample before the crux of this charming, swaggering tune emerges. “My words made a cheque,” Keith proudly declares of his self-made success, before handing the song over to Owusu, who unleashes a dexterous, tongue-twisted verse filled with memorable boasts like “Aria, eight noms isn’t enough” and “you put your name next to mine, the audacity.” In and out in just over two minutes, this is a first-round knockout blow by two of the country’s finest. For more: Tasman Keith’s debut album A Colour Album is out 8 July. For fans of: Kitty Pryde, Grimes, Maggie Rogers Mallrat’s meteoric rise was never more apparent than when she revealed the first album she ever bought was 2014’s Broke With Expensive Taste by Azealia Banks. Less than eight years later, Banks was in the studio, telling the 23-year-old the pair “should Eve and Gwen Stefani this shit” on a fresh cut slated for Mallrat’s debut album. Time is a flat circle, it would seem. Mallrat continues her genre-hopping on Surprise Me, providing a breathy falsetto chorus over a hypnotic beat and underwater synths, while Banks offers up a typical brash and bonkers verse to cap the song. Banks even nods to the Aussie origins of the pairing, with a reference to a pussy “tighter than Nicole Kidman’s face”. Indeed. For more: Mallrat’s debut album Butterfly Blue is out 13 May. For fans of: Deep Forest, Washed Out, Neon Indian Flume moved to the Northern Rivers after returning to Australia from global touring commitments, and a cursory listen to his new music would suggest that his most important collaborator now is the flocks of native birds that open the atmospheric, beautiful title track to Palaces. Less a song than a statement of intent, this is clearly a slice of a larger construction, a snippet to whet the appetite. Despite not arriving until the track is nearly three minutes old, Damon Albarn’s unmistakable schoolboy choir vocal slides in and swarms. Flume’s musical influences are often inscrutable, and even with Albarn’s mockney threatening to drag Streten’s cauldron of sounds into Gorillaz territory, it’s to his own credit and lack of ego that Flume serves the song first and foremost, as any great singer would. This is dangerously close to being music to meditate to – the come down from the Technicolored rave of Flume’s earlier work. For more: Palaces For fans of: Joni Mitchell, Nick Drake, Holly Throsby Even as a 16-year-old, it was clear that Lisa Mitchell didn’t belong on the Australian Idol soundstage (she finished sixth in the 2006 season). Closer to the spiritual goddaughter of Sarah Blasko than a smiley duet partner for Millsy, her preceding three albums present a gentle, thoughtful artist who leans towards earthy instrumentation and slow-burning tunes that demand attention. Six years has passed between albums, and not a lot has changed for Mitchell. Apricot is the finest song from new album A Place To Fall Apart, and also the least instant – a barely-there tone poem that moves at a glacial pace, and will reward repeat listens. Delicately picked guitar lines stammer under the vocal like animals in the undergrowth, brushes scrape against the snare as if trying to slip past without disturbing the scenery, and Mitchell whispers melody across the top, in the apricot tree, watching it all unravel. For more: A Place To Fall Apart is out now. For fans of: WAAX, La Tigre, Yeah Yeah Yeahs The excellently named Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers are confused. The Canberra four-piece want to know what exactly men get from yelling at women from passing cars, from treating women as lesser beings. They aren’t too concerned with the faulty reasoning, however, instead gleefully chanting “fuck off” repeatedly throughout the tune, as if participants in the pep rally from hell in Nirvana’s famous Teen Spirit clip. Vocalist Anna Ryan describes the song in a press release as “a big middle finger to all the men that have treated us like we’re less than in the music industry”, and the righteous fury blasts through. The song’s premise stems from bassist Jaida Stephenson, who smashed her teeth in a skating mishap, only to be told by a male dentist she should “stick to girl sports”. Luckily, rock music is very much a girls sport. For more: New EP Pretty Good For A Girl Band is out 13 May For fans of: The Lucksmiths, Blur, The Mountain Goats Gold Coast quintet Pure Milk make adorably warm indie pop, the type that was once delivered a few songs at a time on short CD runs through Candle records at the turn of the century. Built on a jaunty rhythm track that recalls Blur’s Coffee and TV – and not unlike that ode to domestic normality – Dreams On A Platter speaks of dry Brisbane grass, dying flowers, and one kid’s move to the big city. As with Pure Milk’s earlier music, there is plenty of anxiety sitting just beneath the bouncy, lo-fi soundtrack. Vocalist Lewis Nitschinsk sounds like a less nasally John Darnielle, and like the Mountain Goats’ frontman, his wry, descriptive lyrics take centre-stage, separating Pure Milk from all the indie-pop hopefuls.

Party Ghost launches with brightly distorted guitars, and unfolds into an anthem that would have been perfectly at home on the American Pie soundtrack if not for Ben David’s Aussie twang and his penchant for Melbourne references. A song about feeling out of place, both emotionally and physically, Party Ghost takes on split personas at times, the jeering “I’m sure you’ll come back when the parties get boring,” seemingly coming from a naysayer doubting his commitment to his new environment. Cahli Blakers of Teenage Joans sweetly harmonises in verse two, adding a bright, Jimmy Eat World feel to David’s despair.

5/5/2022,"Victoria’s Coalition has reversed its opposition to state-based treaty negotiations with Indigenous peoples, saying it is prepared to work with traditional owners to “advance the treaty process”. Before the 2018 state election, the opposition leader, Matthew Guy, argued treaty negotiations should occur at a national level and said a state-based approach was bound to fail. On Wednesday, Marcus Stewart, co-chair of the body leading Victoria’s treaty process, said he was concerned that the opposition had not clarified its position on Australia’s first formal agreement framework with Indigenous communities, launched by the Andrews government. In a statement on Wednesday night, the opposition’s Aboriginal affairs spokesperson, Peter Walsh, told Guardian Australia the Coalition would work with traditional owners to “advance the treaty process in a way that supports self-determination and reconciliation while strengthening community and connection to country”. “Treaty is deeply personal, meaning that the road to achieving treaty will be different things to all people,” Walsh said. “As treaty negotiations progress, it must be in a way that meets the ideals and expectations of all Aboriginal Victorians and contributes positively to Closing the Gap on a whole range of measures, in addition to those set out in the Agreement between the states and territories.” Victoria is currently the only jurisdiction in Australia that is moving on both the treaty and truth-telling components of the 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart. Speaking ahead of an appearance before the Yoorrook truth-telling commission on Thursday, Stewart, who co-chairs the body leading Victoria’s treaty process, said he was keen for the opposition to “work with us”. “We hope that we will see them stand with us like we’ve asked Victorians to do, and work with us like we’ve asked Victorians to do, and we hope to see that sooner rather than later,” he said. “What we’re setting out to do here is put Aboriginal people in the driver’s seat on decisions that disproportionately impact them. “I think most people in this country would agree that First Nations people should be making decisions on First Nations issues.” The Yoorrook commission – Australia’s first formal truth-telling process – began hearing testimonies from Indigenous elders last week. The commission will help guide the state’s treaty process with Indigenous Victorians. Yorrook, which has the powers of a royal commission, has a mandate to investigate and document past and present injustices against Victoria’s First Nations people, including by the state and non-government bodies. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Stewart said the truth-telling commission would feed into the treaty process and ensure it could create “meaningful structural reform to right the wrongs.” “It will make sure that our people can once again make decisions about our communities, our culture, and our country,” he said. “Yoorrook will gather the evidence, treaty will deliver the reforms. Change will come with the winds of treaty … that’s what’s critically important.” The Victorian state budget, handed down on Tuesday, included $151m for the state’s treaty process, with $55.7m earmarked for the next financial year. The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Services has accused the government of underfunding its service, saying the state could not fulfil the potential of its treaty process, the Yoorrook commission and its Closing the Gap justice targets when Indigenous people could not “access the legal services that they need”. The Yoorrook commission will hand down an interim report next month.

5/5/2022,"As inflation hits 5.1%, shopping for the best value and quality groceries is high on the agenda. The colder months also mean that getting maximum nutrition for your dollar, to ward against winter colds and flus, is important. But what’s good and what’s not? And what should you grab while you see it, as produce shortages caused by lack of labour as well as unfavourable weather events continue to affect big supermarkets?“All the green leafy vegetables are starting to come into season,” says Joe Mirabella, produce buyer at Boccaccio independent grocer in Balwyn, Melbourne. “Think high-vitamin greens like silverbeet … at about $3.99 for a decent sized bunch.” A treat for those who like their vegetables tasty – the local season for baby brussels sprouts has just started, says Alan Li, from Fruits on Coventry at the South Melbourne market. At markets, the price for half kilogram is about $4 and coming down, but at supermarkets the cost can be much higher. Producer Scott Samwell, of Eastbrook Farms in Mount Barker, South Australia, says a wet spring and early summer followed by a dry Christmas and new year has affected yield, but all types of brussels sprouts including kalettes – a cross between red kale and brussels sprouts – now make good eating. “Some, like the red brussels sprouts, are sweeter than others with a more classic, peppery taste,” he says. While it’s easy to add silverbeet or spinach, wilted with a little olive oil or butter, to most meals, or turn them into something special like mushroom and silverbeet lasagne or spanakopita, brussels sprouts can seem a bit more challenging. Chef Justin James, owner of Adelaide’s award-winning Restaurant Botanic says brussels sprouts taste best when combined with other strong flavours. Mash them with bacon or pancetta, he suggests. “Or roast them and toss them in olive oil and lots of lemon juice.”“Sherry vinegar combined with brussels sprouts is also very good. You can marinate them in it, and add a little at the end.” With root vegetables coming into season, potatoes are a fantastic buy, says Georgina Dragwidge of Georgie’s Harvest. “My pick is Pontiacs, at around $5.50 a kilogram.” Says James: “I love a good potato salad, winter or summer, because it goes very well with a lot of dishes. “You can also add plenty of nutritious vegetables in to season it.” After boiling the potatoes in salty water, lay them out in the fridge to cool and dry. “A waterlogged potato is the enemy of a good potato salad.” James adds Kewpie mayonnaise, although any creamy mayo will do, olive oil, lemon juice, and finely chopped celery and apples. Celery is down to about $4 a bunch and it is apple season. Says Mirabella: “With the cooler weather, apples straight off the tree are crunchy, sweet and tangy.” Expect to pay about $5.99 a kilo for a popular variety like Kanzis at markets and around 70c an apple at supermarkets. Mushrooms are now in season with loose cups starting at $11.50 a kilo and portobello $14.50 a kilo. They’re delicious in stir-fries and casseroles, or pan fried with butter and garlic. For those who love a bit of gourmet grub, now’s the chance to grab wild-foraged pine mushrooms and slippery jacks, about $40 a kilo, at farmers’ markets. “They are only once a season and they are absolutely delicious,” Dragwidge says. “They have already started to feature on a lot of cook, chefs’ websites and will be found in most states except Queensland, which might not have the right weather.” James suggests grilling them with a lot of dry heat to remove some of the slippery moisture. “They’re not for everyone,” he says. Celeriac on the other hand, at about $5 a bunch, can be a crowd pleaser, especially when you shred it with carrots and apple for a coleslaw and add a dressing of apple cider vinegar, mustard, oil, salt and maple syrup. “Add a handful of chopped chives and parsley to season it,” says James. Other good veggie drawer fillers: sweet potato, at about $4.50 a kilo, zucchinis, about $4 to $5 a kilo, and cauliflower from $4.50 for a whole head. “Grapes, especially Black Sapphire, are really fresh, firm and juicy right now,” says Dragwidge. Expect to pay from $5 to $13 for fancier varieties. New season mandarins out of Queensland are sweet and a good size, for about $3.99 a kilo, says Li. Navel oranges are down to about $1 each, but pears are cheaper as autumn is prime season. Varieties such as William Bartlett, Beurré Bosc and Josephine, are priced at about $3.50 a kilo. Despite the Queensland floods, the current eating quality of pineapples is amazing, says Gavin Scurr from Pinata Farms in the Sunshine Coast. “It’s as good as it gets with awesome flavour and nice, big pineapples for $3 to $4.” For a special dessert, James suggests slicing them thinly and layering on mascarpone cheese flavoured with a little honey and lemon juice before rolling them up like a canoli.

5/5/2022,"Labor will appoint an ambassador for human rights if it wins the federal election, pledging to restore Australia’s leadership on the world stage and draw a line under Scott Morrison’s “negative globalism”. Weeks after it emerged the Australian Human Rights Commission risks having its global accreditation downgraded, Labor also promised to “defend” the institution with a return to merit-based appointments. The policy to be outlined on Thursday includes the appointment of a dedicated ambassador for human rights to “advance the rights and protections for people living with a disability, ethnic and religious minorities, and LGBTIQ+ individuals”. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, Penny Wong, said Australia must strengthen its capacity to uphold the international human rights system and to work with partners to counter attempts to undermine it. “Amid rising authoritarianism and repeated assaults on the global rules-based order, it is more important than ever to ensure Australia’s foreign policy advances our interests and our values – to shape the world for the better,” she told Guardian Australia. “There is a clear choice between more of the same under Scott Morrison – and restoring Australia’s place in the international community with Anthony Albanese.” Labor mentioned actions by authoritarian leaders in Russia, China and Myanmar in an accompanying policy statement. “From [Vladimir] Putin’s illegal and immoral war against the innocent people of Ukraine, to the undermining of the One Country, Two Systems arrangement in Hong Kong, and the military in Myanmar, authoritarian leaders are undermining the rule of law and the letter and spirit of the UN Charter,” the statement said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Amanda Gorely, a career diplomat, serves as Australia’s ambassador and permanent representative to the UN and to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. While Gorely’s responsibilities include engaging with the UN on human rights, she also has a much broader remit for disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control. It is understood Labor’s planned new position of a dedicated ambassador for human rights is intended to fill the gap between the Geneva-based representative and the Australian Human Rights Commission. The ambassador, to be based in Australia but who would travel as needed, would engage with human rights organisations and diaspora groups in Australia on international human rights issues. The AHRC was put on notice last month that it risks having its global accreditation downgraded. It is claimed the government bypassed open merit-based selection processes for the appointment of Lorraine Finlay as human rights commissioner in 2021 and Ben Gauntlett as disability discrimination commissioner in 2019. Labor vowed to appoint commissioners “in a transparent manner on the basis of merit, consistent with international standards”. To date, however, Labor has not committed to reversing the government’s funding cuts to the AHRC, which have contributed to the loss of one in three jobs. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said a Labor government would “do far more to stand up for our values by defending and promoting the rule of law in both the domestic and international arenas”. Labor argues Morrison’s previous comments about “negative globalism” amounted to “deriding the worth of international rules and norms”. In a speech in Sydney in 2019 when Donald Trump was still US president, Morrison warned against “an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy” or “any reflex towards a negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill-defined borderless global community”. Since the onset of the pandemic, however, Morrison has adopted a more positive tone about the importance of international cooperation, while raising concerns about a new “arc of autocracy”.",News/Australia news,"Human rights ambassador needed to restore reputation after Morrison’s ‘negative globalism’, Labor says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/human-rights-ambassador-needed-to-restore-reputation-after-morrisons-negative-globalism-labor-says
5/5/2022,"One of the hardy post-poll adages politicians routinely defer to is that the voters are never wrong when it comes to returning or rejecting governments at democratic elections. It’s a statement of the obvious, really: the punters hear what they hear and vote for the party or candidate or leader who best appeals to – or influences – their sympathies. With the major-party primary votes comparatively low (measured against many previous federal elections), and amid the rise of centrist “teal” candidates in blue-ribbon seats, a significant Green and undecided vote, a constant refrain in voter vox pops seems to be “there is no major difference between the big parties”. Despite an astounding absence of detailed argy-bargy between the Coalition and Labor on several critical policy areas (read climate crisis mitigation – about which there is significant policy difference – and fossil fuels, school and university funding, and foreign and defence strategies), the democratic choice between the major parties – let alone the independents – presents to me, contrarily, as pretty stark. After covering federal politics off and on for the best part of 20 years, these days I dedicate little attentive energy to the daily race-call ins and outs of opposing strategies and tactics. I invest trust in just a few professional political observers. I watch some TV news and alternatively eye-roll or curse the front pages of my city’s daily newspapers on my suburb’s front lawns when I exercise my dogs. Yes, I’m distracted by every single AFL match each weekend and by reading novels and foreign magazines and stuff on the internet about cooking and collie-cross dogs and how to teach them to catch Frisbees and about big-wave surfing and Sean Penn’s performance in Gaslit. But even then, the many stark differences between the Coalition and Labor are apparent to me – as black and white, if you like, as the coat of my collie-cross-bitzer, Olive, who just WILL NOT play Frisbee. Starting with the dignified call in the Uluru statement from the heart for a voice to parliament. Labor has committed to a first-term referendum to enshrine the voice in the constitution. The Coalition opposes it. “It’s not our policy to have a referendum on the voice, so why would I be doing that?” Scott Morrison has said. The major parties are poles apart on this issue that is central to Black and white conciliation in Australia and which is the first step in a voice, treaty, truth process determined at Uluru (on this front the Greens’ position – which prioritises truth and treaties ahead of enshrining a voice – also contrasts markedly with Labor’s, as pointed out here by Thomas Mayor, a signatory to the Uluru statement). Another major issue – and critical difference – between the major parties is their policies on public integrity and a federal commission to deal with corruption. Labor has, if elected, pledged to establish a powerful national integrity commission by Christmas. The Morrison government introduced to the last parliament an exposure draft (not the same as putting forward finished legislation) for a largely toothless commission. It blamed Labor (which wanted a more powerful anti-corruption watchdog and refused to support it in full) for its failure to meet its 2019 election promise to create a federal anti-corruption body. Morrison has repeatedly derided the New South Wales anti-corruption commission – the template for tough public integrity enforcement, which has scalped by Labor and senior Liberal figures – as a “kangaroo court”. That’s all pretty different – in tone and intent – when it comes to pursuing federal corruption. Amid the ongoing arm wrestle about who is best able to manage a faltering economy (the government’s message seems to be: We are, however on our watch it’s actually gone to shit in a bucket so you can’t trust them to deal with the consequences; but what would I know – I failed introduction to formal logic in second year!) in the past week alone significant differences have emerged on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (Labor would cut the price of a PBS medicine from $42.50 to $30, the Coalition, $42.50 to $32.50), housing, the gender pay gap, support for the introduction of electric vehicles and related infrastructure, and recommitment to manufacturing in Australia. One of the biggest and most influential social policy differences between the major parties is on nursing homes. Many have experienced the distressing nightmare of finding appropriate care for parents or other loved ones. For others it is an unpalatable contemplation of what, may, personally lie ahead not too distantly. It affects most of us one way or another and Labor has, correctly, identified it as an electoral slow burn. The differences relate to the cost of dignity and greater levels of care. Now to the glaring same-same that will rapidly become illusory should the Greens, teal and other independents hold the keys to government formation post-21 May. It is the vow by Morrison and Labor’s Anthony Albanese not to form a minority government in the event neither wins an outright majority. Morrison is an experienced prime minister, albeit one whose governmental, interpersonal and empathic capacities frequently fall hopelessly short. Albanese may be the lesser campaigner but he is a far more temperamentally adept negotiator and conciliator, as his success as manager of government business in the Gillard minority government (which remarkably passed 561 pieces of legislation) attests. And that looms as a really significant contrast – one that might count the most in a little over two weeks’ time. Amid all the tedium, the off-putting endless chatter about tactics and strategy and who’s ahead and what voters really want, that is the compelling political thought that keeps competing with all the distractions in a mind largely detached from the weeds of this election campaign.

5/5/2022,"Mortgage holders in Australia have this week faced the unwelcome but not completely unexpected news that they will be paying more, with the central bank lifting the official cash interest rate for the first time since 2010. So what can borrowers do to ease mortgage pressure as interest rates climb? Canstar’s editor-at-large, Effie Zahos, said the Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision on 3 May to raise interest rates from emergency lows to a new cash rate of 0.35% will translate to an increase of $88 each month on the average mortgage. Under the new rate, the monthly payment on a $600,000 home loan would rise to $2,324, an increase of $74, the Finder.com.au comparison website states. For someone with a $1m loan, repayments would rise by $130 a month. So the first thing borrowers can do is shop around to see which banks have the best interest rates on offer. Compare other lender offerings with your own mortgage and if you are not getting the best deal, take action. “Talk to your lender first, see if they have cheaper alternatives,” Zahos said. New customers get better deals than existing customers, she said, so it could be time to look at refinancing your loan. “We know new loans are [on average] at 2.49% interest and existing customers are at 2.92% – that’s a difference of 0.43%,” Zahos said. “That’s almost two rate hikes, so you can get yourself a buffer. The cheaper home loans will go up but you’re coming from a low base.” Zahos said the next step is going through your own bills. “It’s going to be boring, it means you’ll have to sit down, print out your statement and highlight everything recurring.” You need to look at everything from your home and contents insurance, to health insurance, energy bills, your internet plan, subscriptions and gym memberships. “Ask yourself: ‘Do I want it? Do I need it? And am I on the best possible plan?’” Zahos said. “Right now it doesn’t pay to be average, you want to be better than average.” Look for either the cheapest or the one that gets you the best value. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The chief executive of Financial Counselling Australia, Fiona Guthrie, says the other important thing to do is to see what concessions you might qualify for. “For instance, you might be entitled to electricity concession,” Guthrie said. “State governments have good concession finder websites, where you put the information into the site and it shows you what you’re entitled to.” When announcing the decision to increase the cash rate from the record low 0.1%, the RBA signalled more rises to come, with governor Philip Lowe saying it was “not unreasonable” to expect interest rates to rise to 2.5%. Zahos said it could be helpful to take some time now to check if a fixed or variable rate is better for you. With fixed rates at 2% last year, many Australians already switched in expectation that rates would rise. A fixed rate can offer certainty over two or three years, she said, but there were pros and cons, so doing your research was important. “You may want to consider locking it in – the cheapest fixed rate on Canstar’s database is 3.28%,” Zahos said. “You only need a couple of rate hikes to happen and you would be in a better situation at the end of this year.” Guthrie said the first thing you should do if you’re struggling is talk to your bank. “Definitely speak to your creditors and your bank. They have really improved after the last 10 years,” Guthrie said. They should be able to offer help – whether it’s reducing your repayments, offering you lower interest or temporarily pausing your home loan. There are options available. In some states, there are also mortgage relief schemes. You can look into these, and it’s always good to call in professional help.",News/Australia news,Worried about rising interest rates?

5/5/2022,"The Greens, Katter’s Australian Party and pro-climate action independents don’t often sing from the same songbook. But One Nation’s fielding of a candidate from suburban Melbourne to represent the north Queensland city of Townsville has drawn a chorus of condemnation from those rival candidates, one of whom says she is “flabbergasted and disgusted” by the move. It was not long after midday on 22 April that a representative from the Australian Electoral Commission read aloud the order in which candidates would appear on the ballot for the seat of Herbert. There were 11 candidates, but one name stood out: Diane Pepe. It was not Pepe’s party – One Nation – which raised eyebrows , but her home address in Pakenham, Victoria. Pepe was not present at the event, but most of the other candidates were, the Katter’s Australian party candidate Clynton Hawks said. “When they said ‘Victoria’, we all looked around at one another,” Hawks told Guardian Australia. “Victoria is classed as Mexico in my books. They get all the gold paved roads and the nice new trains, while up here in north Queensland we fight for the crumbs. “You are supposed to be representing the people and this person is a ring-in from three states away?” An AEC spokesperson confirmed Pepe’s address in Pakenham – in Melbourne’s outer south-east – was read out at the declaration of nominations. The spokesperson ​​said a candidate was not required to live in the division that they are contesting. A doctor running as an independent, Angela Egan, and the Greens candidate, Scott Humphreys, said they were as shocked as Hawks. “I was flabbergasted and disgusted,” Egan said. Egan said she had never heard of Pepe prior to her name being read out and had not seen her since. “This is exactly why I am standing,” she said. “To give people a local, independent option. Not even being in the state of Queensland, that’s pretty sad.” One Nation secured 11.09% of primary votes in Herbert at the 2019 election, more than the KAP, the Greens and the UAP, and behind only the two major parties. In such a crowded field, preferences proved crucial to electing the Liberal National party’s Phillip Thompson, whose primary vote was 37.11%. Pepe was contacted for comment. Her husband answered the phone but stopped responding after questions about her address. A private Facebook page under Diane Pepe’s name, last updated in late 2020 and displaying pro-One Nation and anti-Covid-19 vaccine-mandate posts, lists her as living in Melbourne. Pepe does not appear to have any official social media presence as a candidate and, as of Wednesday afternoon, her profile was not listed on One Nation’s candidates page. Her current Australian Business Number is linked to her address in Pakenham, stretching back to at least 2007. One Nation was asked where Pepe lived but did not respond. Graeme Orr, a politics expert at the University of Queensland (UQ), said there was “nothing morally or normatively wrong” in candidates living outside their electorates and that One Nation was not the only party to do so. Orr cited the example of Kennedy, where Bob Katter has held a stranglehold and, in the past, a Labor candidate might have been on a “hiding to nothing”. “So they might get a UQ student who’s an activist, to be the dummy,” Orr said. “But people living in Kennedy, who want to vote Labor, are entitled to have a Labor choice – we do have a party-based system.” One Nation, he said, was a “genuine party with a history” and was entitled to do similarly. The question was: why they had done so in a seat in which they polled so strongly in 2019? “One Nation, we’d always presumed, had a reasonably strong nationwide set of activists and supporters,” he said. “But that may be a false assumption based on 20 odd years ago, when Hanson exploded on the scene.” Greg Dowling, a former rugby league footballer, is representing Clive Palmer’s party in Herbert; the previously One Nation-linked Steve Clare is running as an independent; while the the Great Australian party and the Informed Medical Options party are also running candidates, in addition to KAP. “[One Nation] are not an astroturf party, they’re not even a Palmer party,” Orr said. “At previous elections where they might have been expected to do well, One Nation would get a swell of genuine of activists. But now they’re competing for candidates as well as activists with four or five or six other parties … There may just be too much competition on the libertarian right.” Pepe’s does not appear to be an isolated case. The Guardian has seen internal emails that show One Nation was still desperate to find people to run for it just hours before the nominating deadline on 21 April, telling one prospective candidate that the party didn’t “require you to do anything or campaign at all”. A similar, 11th hour scramble appears to have occurred with One Nation’s preference deals. Last week, the party’s candidate for the marginal seat of Longman – where One Nation preferences could prove decisive – told Guardian Australia that preference recommendations were his call and that he would be putting the LNP last. In contrast to Pepe, Ross Taylor’s picture and profile appear on One Nation’s website. The local electrician’s contact details are publicly available, and when contacted, Taylor spoke with some authority about his electorate and the issues that had been raised to him on the campaign trail. Taylor clearly wanted to win and believes he can do so. Asked about how he would recommend his voters order their preferences, Taylor texted a written list which had the LNP incumbent Terry Young last. “I made the final decision yesterday in consultation with HQ, just making sure that we get it right, making sure I’m in a position where I can actually win,” he said last week. Within days, however, Hanson had announced One Nation would preference the LNP in every seat in Queensland. Asked about this on Monday, Taylor confirmed that his preferences had since been “modified”. By this point, Taylor had party-endorsed, printed how-to-vote cards, which had Young now at fifth, Labor at sixth, the Animal Justice party at seventh and the Greens last. Taylor said he couldn’t remember when the order was modified but denied he had been railroaded into the changes by party operatives. “I just can’t put a Labor party in and I can’t put a Greens party in at all, there’s just no way, gotta put them down the bottom,” he said. He noted that Young’s how-to-vote card had since preferenced One Nation second. The LNP is recommending its Queensland voters preference One Nation second on their senate ballots, a move some political analysts believe could be “the deciding factor” that sees Pauline Hanson re-elected.",News/Australia news,‘Flabbergasted’: Melbourne-based One Nation candidate running in north Queensland seat,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/flabbergasted-melbourne-based-one-nation-candidate-running-in-north-queensland-seat
5/5/2022,"Conservationists fear new rules that regulate logging on private land in New South Wales will allow continued clearing of koala habitat in what an independent MP has described as a “win” for the National party. The Perrottet government this week released a long-awaited new code for private native forestry (PNF) that sets out rules for private landowners who undertake logging operations on their properties. The code formed part of negotiations within the Coalition following the near split of the government over koala protections in 2020. The new rules increase the area of the state mapped as core and highly suitable koala habitat – which triggers certain protections and land management requirements – and this has been generally welcomed by conservationists, the NSW opposition and some crossbench MPs. But there is concern that parts of the new provisions will lead to increased logging intensity and that the code still allows logging of core koala habitat in some circumstances. Under the rules, logging is prohibited in areas mapped as core koala habitat but an exception is made for logging of habitat covered by private forestry plans that had already been approved. The North East Forest Alliance said this exemption applied to hundreds of plans. The prohibition also applies to land identified as core habitat by councils that established a koala plan of management before the Coalition dispute over koala policy. But it will not apply to new core koala habitat identified by councils which develop a management plan in the future. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dailan Pugh, the alliance’s spokesperson, said the exceptions were concerning. “If we’re talking about doubling koala populations, you don’t do that by cutting down their feed trees,” he said. “We are relieved they’ve retained protections for existing core koala habitat but we are concerned about the hundreds of approvals already given despite the (NSW parliamentary) koala inquiry identifying this as something that needed fixing.” Pugh added that for other threatened plants and animals the new code offered “no real protection whatsoever”. Justin Field, an independent MLC, said he was concerned other parts of the code that require landowners to take certain precautions for the environment, such as retaining trees of a particular size and habitat suitability, appeared to have been weakened. He said the new rules would potentially increase the intensity of logging operations by reducing the number and size of trees that must to be retained. “At a time when there are warnings that the koala faces extinction in NSW in the next few decades, the Liberal party has again caved to the Nationals on koala protections,” he said.

It also said increased reporting requirements from landholders about their logging activities would improve enforcement and compliance. “The new farm forestry codes provide increased protections for koalas, whilst also providing certainty and consistency for farmers after a difficult few years of drought, bushfires, a mouse plague, Covid-19 and floods dramatically impacting primary production,” the agriculture minister, Dugald Saunders, said. Saunders said the codes increased tree retention in koala habitat, provided landholders with an updated list of primary and secondary koala feed trees, outlined harvest exclusion zones around trees used by koalas and prohibited harvesting in rainforest or old growth forest. A spokesperson for the NSW Environment Protection Authority said the prohibition on logging would apply to more than 10,000 hectares of koala habitat and there were now protections for an additional 2.8 million hectares mapped as highly suitable koala habitat. “Koalas will have more trees they prefer protected, with the PNF codes requiring that more koala feed trees are retained during forestry operations, increasing from 15 to 20 koala feed trees per hectare,” they said.",News/Australia news,"New NSW logging rules still allow clearing of koala habitat, conservationists say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/new-nsw-logging-rules-still-allow-clearing-of-koala-habitat-conservationists-say
5/5/2022,"Victoria is expecting overseas migration and international student numbers to return to pre-pandemic levels by the middle of 2024, though experts say more needs to be done to ensure it actually happens. Tuesday’s state budget forecasts Victoria’s population to grow by 1.2% in 2022-23 and 1.7% in each of the following three years, which is a return to the average growth rate of the past two decades. It comes after a 0.1% increase in population in 2021-22 and a decrease of 0.7% in 2020-21, when many foreigners and international students returned home due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “With border restrictions now eased, the flows of migrants and foreign students to Victoria are expected to gradually increase over the course of 2022, reaching around pre-pandemic levels by 2023-24,” the budget papers said. “Victoria’s strong labour market, highly ranked education sector, welcoming and diverse multicultural community, and liveability should once again attract an outsized share of Australia’s overall migrant intake.” The education policy lead at the Mitchell Institute at Victoria University, Dr Peter Hurley, said he expected it will take a couple of years for international students to return to pre-pandemic levels. “There’s still those lingering effects of the pandemic, particularly for places like China, where it’s still very difficult to come and go,” he said. “They haven’t quite got open borders, so that’s has a big impact on Chinese international student’s choice.” Hurley said there were about 90,000 students enrolled in Australia universities but studying remotely, mainly in China. He said Australia would probably have lost international students when its border was closed to other countries who offer easier pathways to citizenship, such as Canada or the UK. The government also expects interstate migration to improve over the course of 2022 and 2023, after Victoria lost tens of thousands of residents to other states after lengthy lockdowns. Simon Kuestenmacher, a co-founder of The Demographics Group in Melbourne, described the budget forecasts as “realistic”, given the state was unlikely to impose lockdowns again. “People might still harbour ill will towards the ruling party if they’re so inclined, but this will fade away and we’ll see a return to pre-pandemic population shifts, meaning the young people of Australia will move to Melbourne and stay put for a decade,” he said. “We’ll also see a return to pre-pandemic levels of migration sooner rather than later because we want migrants and I think there’s still plenty of migrants who want to come to Australia.” Kuestenmacher was optimistic the state could recruit 2,000 healthcare workers from overseas – as announced in the budget – but said the government should look beyond financial incentives to lure them to Victoria. “You obviously want to make sure those healthcare workers are being offered good money but they also need to be offered affordable housing close to their job,” he said. Make those two things happen and you’ve got it nailed. “If I was the government building a new hospital somewhere, I would also be buying up land next to it to build wonderfully spacious apartments for nurses and other healthcare workers who don’t make upwards of $250,000.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The chief executive of the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, Melinda Cilento, said she was pleased to see the government acknowledge the important role skilled migrants play in Victoria’s economy. “The Victorian government signalling that they have the welcome sign out is really important, because with the borders having been closed for two years, I think that messaging in and of itself is an important factor in getting back to where we were,” she said. Cilento said she wanted to see the federal government’s visa approval process sped up and easier pathways to permanent residency offered as Australia competes with other nations for skilled migrants.",News/Australia news,"Victoria’s population growth will soon return to pre-pandemic levels, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/victorias-population-growth-will-soon-return-to-pre-pandemic-levels-experts-say
5/5/2022,"Civil engineers have welcomed a move by the Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, to overhaul the way the state awards construction contracts in a bid to rein in cost blowouts in its $21.3bn a year “big build” infrastructure program. In Tuesday’s state budget, Pallas said the state government would work more closely on scoping projects with private industry, as well as standardising contracts and setting up a register of projects worth $100m to make it easier for contractors and suppliers to know what is coming down the infrastructure pipeline. It comes after the state last year paid $1.9bn to settle a dispute between the government, contractor Transurban and builder John Holland over who was responsible for toxic soil at the site of the West Gate Tunnel project. In 2020 the state paid an extra $1.3bn to settle a dispute with the consortium building the Metro Tunnel. Projects worth more than $100m are, on average, running 4% over budget – costing the state $5.8bn – and are 20% behind time, budget papers show. The government had already quietly begun carving bigger projects into more manageable chunks before the budget. In 2020, it withdrew a proposal to do the Northern Roads Upgrade project, which is part of a $2.2bn suburban roads package, through an overarching public-private partnership (PPP) and replaced it with a series of smaller jobs. Rowenna Walker, a senior executive at civil engineering group Aurecon and the president of Consult Australia, which represents civil engineers and design and advisory firms, said the reforms announced by Pallas would allow the state to use “more collaborative models of contracting design” which would give “a bit more flexibility”. “From Consult Australia and the broader industry, that’s what we’ve been advocating for a long time,” she said. Walker said that the enormous volume of infrastructure work coming through in Victoria and New South Wales over the next few years meant that contractors, who previously would have bid on work that had poor profit margins in order to keep their businesses going, could now choose not to. “Where they might see risk, or they may see that they won’t necessarily get a good commercial outcome they’re often not bidding,” she said. “For [the state government] to deliver their infrastructure pipeline, they’ve got to make the arrangement attractive to get the range of bidders that they need and that they want.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The $1.8bn Western Roads Upgrade project, which was done as a PPP, led to the collapse last year of key subcontractor Civilink. Work was then continued by construction consortium member WBHO Infrastructure, which admitted it underestimated how much work would be required and lost more than $100m on the job. WBHO Infrastructure and the wider Probuild group, which it was part of, collapsed in February. Walker said that across the industry, Consult Australia members were seeing delayed payments, lost income when senior contractors went under, and facing increased claims for compensation for shoddy work or other alleged problems from those above them in the supply chain. This was caused by “underestimation, underbidding or underestimation of risk or realisation of risk over and above what was originally anticipated,” she said. A spokesperson for Major Roads Projects Victoria said the Western Roads Upgrade was now finished and the agency was now using what it calls a “program delivery approach” (PDA) to finish the rest of the suburban roads project. The PDA “is a collaborative model, providing great opportunity for industry, and enabling businesses at all levels to get shovel-ready projects into delivery,” the spokesperson said. On Tuesday, Pallas said PPPs had caused “a bit of grief from time to time”, including on the Metro project, but the government would continue to use them because there was “no one size fits all approach to the way that we operate”. He defended the Western Roads project, saying the costs borne by the state were “relatively modest”.",News/Australia news,Engineers welcome bid to rein in cost blowouts in Victorian government projects,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/engineers-welcome-bid-to-rein-in-cost-blowouts-in-victorian-government-projects
5/5/2022,"When single mum Casey* bought a house in February with help from the Coalition’s Home Guarantee scheme, it helped her recover from the financial abuse she endured by her daughter’s father, and break the cycle of insecure renting. She was mindful of choosing a home that wouldn’t keep her “awake at night thinking of mortgage repayments”, a wise move given the interest rates rise, and bought a modest unit for $400,000. But she says she was lucky to find a home for that price and saving a 2% deposit and affording mortgage repayments can be a stretch for many single parents. It’s why she thinks Labor’s Help to Buy election promise, which offers shared equity in homes, could be good news for helping more single parents achieve the housing security she now has. “It has a lot of value in it because people can get into a home before they have the capability to fully own it themselves,” Casey said. A shared equity scheme, specifically targeted at single parents, is already being pursued by Melbourne based charity Ys Housing. It has just been given approval to build its first nine homes in the Melbourne suburb of Reservoir to help transition single mums out of social housing. “It’s basically very similar, if not identical to what the Labour party is proposing … And we think it’s a really interesting solution for low income single parents,” Oscar McLennan, a co-founder of Ys Housing, says. “It allows you security of tenure, it’s your house … And on a monthly basis, you’re spending, in some cases, substantially less than you would if you’re in the private rental market. “You’re actually proportioning risk with the government, but more importantly you’re not putting families under housing stress month to month, and that is the key.” Labor’s Help to Buy scheme, announced on Sunday, is not specifically targeted at single parents. It promises to contribute up to 40% of the house price for new homes, and 30% for existing homes, for 10,000 low income earners. Homeowners would then pay a minimum 2% deposit and mortgage repayments on upwards of 60% of the property price. It is modelled on similar schemes in Western Australia and Victoria, which was praised by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, when he was treasurer in 2017. The Coalition has expanded its Home Guarantee scheme to 50,000 places annually, with 5,000 spots targeted to single parents with incomes up to $125,000 who can buy a home with only a 2% deposit and have lenders mortgage insurance waived. Financial experts have flagged that entering the property market with a 2% to 5% deposit is risky as mortgage rates rise. According to analysis by Ys Housing, if interest rates rise from 2% to 4.5%, single parents who bought a $600,000 house with a 2% deposit with a 30-year mortgage under the Coalition’s scheme will have their mortgage repayments rise by $900 a month. Those buying a house under the same terms, but with 40% under Labor’s shared equity scheme, would have their repayments rise by $500. The chief executive of the Union for Single Mothers and their Children, Jenny Davidson, praises the Coalition’s scheme for helping single parents buy homes. Over the last year, more than 2,300 single parents out of the 2,500 places available under the Coalition’s Home Guarantee scheme have bought a home, with 85% being single mums. But Davidson says a shared equity scheme would expand this help to the many single parents who can’t afford 2% deposits or mortgage repayments on current house prices. She told Guardian Australia this in an interview prior to Labor’s Help to Buy policy announcement. Speaking after Labor’s announcement, she said: “It’s going to help a tiny percentage of single mother families in Australia.” “We also need more social housing, we also need better support for families that are renting and in reality are probably going to be renting for their entire lives,” she said. Matt Grudnoff, a senior economist at the Australia Institute, says that while Labor’s policy would help expand the Coalition’s scheme to people who can’t afford mortgage repayments, he is weary of it pushing up house prices. “Both major parties aren’t keen to actually reform the system,” he says. “They just sort of tinker around the edges and the tinkering often is about privileging one group or another at the expense of making housing less affordable in the future. “If you wanted to really help single parents, then I think strong rental reforms would be another way you could do it.” Julia*, a single mum renting in an outer suburb in Melbourne, says she has lived in three different rentals in the past three years, and has been on the waiting list for social housing since 2019. Julia has been trying to secure a spot under the Coalition’s Home Guarantee scheme, doing her best to save the 2% deposit. “I only drive when necessary. Put extra jumpers on in winter, keep the curtains closed during summer. Never throw out food,” she says. “If I got a house I would just spend six months in disbelief that I’m no longer [at] risk of being kicked out. I’d have stability for my daughter. I could paint her room.” But Julia hasn’t been able to get approval for a loan. Asked if she would seek the Labor government’s Help to Buy scheme if they are elected, Julia says she was weary of co-ownership with the government but would like to find out more information. Julia is considering moving to a rural area where homes are cheaper, but that means leaving her job and support network. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning McLennan says he thinks the stacking cost of living single parents face when moving further away and into lower standard housing is often lost in the debate, but it is driving how Ys Housing set up their scheme, as is the need to build new housing stock so as not to push up housing prices. “For us, building new, building along public transport corridors, building with renewables to power the homes and save on energy costs is front of mind and it is key.” * Names have been changed",News/Australia news,A shared equity scheme could help break the cycle of insecure renting for single parents,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/a-shared-equity-scheme-could-help-break-the-cycle-of-insecure-renting-for-single-parents
5/5/2022,"Three years after heated clashes between Adani coalmine supporters and environmental groups created a lingering climate of “fear and scepticism”, regional Australians living in areas with economic ties to fossil fuel industries now overwhelmingly acknowledge the inevitability of the energy transition, a landmark new report says. The report, What Regions Need, is the result of a year’s qualitative research consulting local workers, civic leaders, unions, the energy sector and others by the chief executive of the not-for-profit organisation The Next Economy, Dr Amanda Cahill. It argues for a national plan for net zero with detailed targets and policy settings, and the formation of national and regional transition authorities to help strengthen and diversify regional economies. Cahill describes a significant shift in public sentiment in places like regional Queensland and the New South Wales Hunter valley, as well as a renewed willingness from industry, energy companies and environmental groups to engage after the bruising experiences of the last federal election campaign. “When we started our consultations two years ago, most [regional] people were questioning the whole concept of the energy transition,” Cahill said. “Now people see that things are changing quickly, with early closure announcements for coal plants, our trading partners increasing their climate ambitions and the rapid expansion of renewable energy projects across the country. They want to see a clear plan and support so they can manage these changes.” Cahill, a Churchill scholar whose work focuses on helping regional economies affected by transition in the energy sector, said an “overwhelming majority” of participants in the group’s engagement activities now acknowledge the inevitability of decarbonisation. The Next Economy held a summit in Gladstone last year after hearing concerns from industries, energy companies, local and state governments that they felt unable to have an “open and productive discussion” about the need to plan for a transition. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The hesitancy across all groups stemmed from violent scenes that occurred in central Queensland in the lead-up to the 2019 federal election, when supporters of the Adani Carmichael coalmine led by a group of conservative politicians clashed with environmental protesters. “Two years later, industry and energy players did not want ‘to be seen to be getting political’, government employees were concerned about ‘keeping their jobs’, and union and environmental groups did not want to be responsible for ‘a repeat of what happened in 2019’,” the report said. “The risks taken by some participants to attend, let alone participate in this conversation in central Queensland cannot be overstated and pre-summit meetings with potential participants were dominated by fear and scepticism.” At the summit, the Queensland government-owned Stanwell Corporation, the state’s largest power generator, announced plans to transition to renewables and curtail coal plants. The chief executive of Stanwell, Richard van Breda, resigned a few days later. In the longer term, the report says the summit gave industries and local governments confidence to act. And conversations in communities have now changed. The Queensland government, on the eve of an election, is promoting Gladstone as a potential “renewable energy powerhouse”. Kahn Goodluck, a boilermaker and the acting mayor of Gladstone, said the community with a “proud industrial heritage” needed to plan and adapt for coming changes. “We have some of the biggest industry players in the world but we can’t leave it to industry and business alone, we need government policies and investment that support success,” Goodluck said. “Failure is not an option. Our workers and their families’ livelihoods depend on it.” While sentiment about the inevitability of transition has shifted, workers remain concerned that new industries will develop in a way that affects their working conditions. Participants at workshops cited the LNG boom during the last decade, where the rapid expansion of the industry created jobs but also created cost of living concerns, and, ultimately, left many locals in the lurch when construction ramped down and property prices collapsed. Policy certainty, however, remains difficult while political discussion – and the messaging of some national political parties to regional people – remains fraught. “We can no longer afford to avoid talking honestly and plainly about what the transition really means for everyday Australians, or to play political games with everyone’s future wellbeing and prosperity,” the report says. “If we can bring people together around a clear vision, plan and targets, we are well placed to attract the investment needed to develop new skills and industries that will not only decarbonise our economy, but create thousands of new jobs and economic benefits for regional areas. “We have everything we need to manage this change well. The only thing missing is clear and decisive leadership at a national level.”",News/Australia news,"Mining towns now accept the need for energy transition, new report says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/mining-towns-now-accept-the-need-for-energy-transition-new-report-says
5/5/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and his treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, have both said voting for independent candidates in the federal election could lead to the “chaos” of a hung parliament. However, a Guardian Australia analysis of legislation passed and not passed under various governments shows the minority government led by Julia Gillard actually had a better success rate in passing legislation than the Morrison government. Using records published by the parliament of Australia, it’s possible to see a summary of the number of bills introduced by the government and how many were passed by both houses. This excludes private member’s and senator’s bills. You can read more details about the methods below. The data shows that despite having to negotiate with independents to pass legislation through the House of Representatives, Julia Gillard’s government has the second-highest percentage of passed legislation: Gillard’s government ranks behind only the 41st parliament in which John Howard won control of both the House and the Senate, something which rarely occurs. Lowest on the list are the Abbott, Turnbull-Morrison and Rudd governments – all of which involved governments having to make deals with Senates described as “hostile“ and “feral”. The 2019 Morrison government has had notable struggles passing its own legislation, with the voter identification legislation lacking support, and its religious discrimination bill failing to move through the Senate. Another key policy, legislation to establish a federal anti-corruption body, was not introduced at all, with Morrison blaming a lack of support for the government’s preferred approach. Gillard’s government also scores higher than Morrison’s when looking at the overall rate of legislation passed a day, an index I’ve previously described as “productivity in parliament”. This is an updated version of an analysis I’ve done previously, which makes an attempt to look at the ability of a government to pass legislation, and the volume. Basically, it takes the number of acts passed within a prime minister’s term, and divides this number by their term length. This is a quantity over quality approach, and obviously not all governments will try to pass as many bills as another. Some will prefer a “small government” approach, for example (but even removing “red tape” mostly requires legislating). As with previous versions of this analysis it again shows the Gillard minority government ranking the highest, with Morrison’s term as prime minister sitting between Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott: Last month Frydenberg warned in a media conference this was not the time to take a chance on “the chaos of a hung parliament”. Similarly, when asked during an interview on Tuesday whether he would negotiate with independents, Morrison said he would not. “This is a real question for the people who are voting at this election,” he told 3AW. “Voting for the independents is a vote for chaos.” It should be noted that both of the above analyses do not count the number of bills lost to failed negotiations prior to the introduction of legislation. However, in the context of minority governments, or governments that have a minority in the upper house, these indexes may give us an indication of which governments were better and worse in their negotiations with crossbenchers or the opposition. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The amount of passed and not passed legislation was obtained using the parliament of Australia’s bills search with the relevant options checked. These results were crosschecked with counts obtained from the parlinfo export legislation tool here. For the rate of bills passed a day, the methods are the same as for previous articles. I took all of the Commonwealth of Australia Numbered Acts and assigned them to a prime minister, political party and parliament based on the date it was passed through the Senate. From this dataset, I counted the total acts for each prime minister, party and parliament. Then I determined the number of days in office for each prime minister and the number of days each parliament and party governed.
