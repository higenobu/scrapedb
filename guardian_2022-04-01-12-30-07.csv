4/1/2022,"Almost half of all young people in detention in Australia are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, even though the overall number of children going to jail has fallen in the past five years, research shows. Young Indigenous people are only 5.8% of all young people aged 10-17 in Australia but make up 49% of all young people in detention, according to the latest data released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). Indigenous children were younger when they entered the criminal justice system than their non‑Indigenous counterparts, and more likely to be from remote and lower socio-economic areas. Young people from very remote areas were six times as likely to be in detention as those from major cities. Young people spent an average of six months in detention. The majority of all young people in detention were unsentenced or awaiting trial, the AIHW found. More than a third (37%) of Indigenous young people were first in contact with the criminal justice system when aged 10 to 13, compared with just 14% of non‑Indigenous youth. Cheryl Axleby, the co-chair of Change the Record, an Indigenous-led coalition of welfare and legal groups, said she was appalled by the latest report. “This paints a really clear picture of exactly how our criminal legal system is working – it’s targeting poor kids and black kids,” Axleby said. “On top of that, First Nations kids are more likely to be targeted and dragged into the criminal legal system when they are extremely young. It is outrageous that Aboriginal children in primary school are being arrested by police.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The AIHW found that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth detention rates have fallen over the past five years, but remain disproportionate. Since 2016, the rate of Indigenous young people in detention fell from 161 to 117 per 10,000. The rate of non-Indigenous young people fell from 9.5 to 7.2 per 10,000 over the same period. While rates of youth justice supervision varied among jurisdictions, the Northern Territory fared the worst – 108 of the 115 (or 94%) young people aged 10 and over in the NT youth justice system were Indigenous. The AIHW acknowledged efforts to raise the age of criminal responsibility in Australia from 10 years old. Some jurisdictions, including the NT, are considering raising the age to 12. But the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recently deemed 12 was too young. Since 2019 the UN has recommended that nations increase their minimum age to at least 14 years which, according to the AIHW report, reflects research in child development and neuroscience which provides evidence that children aged 12 and 13 have not fully developed the capacity for abstract reasoning. “Once again the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has confirmed what we already know: if governments are serious about closing the gap and giving our children the opportunity to grow and thrive they must raise the age to at least 14 years old and end the discriminatory and punitive policies that are driving our kids into the criminal legal system,” Axleby said.",News/Australia news,"Half of Australia’s youth detainees are Indigenous children, research finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/half-of-australias-youth-detainees-are-indigenous-children-research-finds
4/1/2022,"New South Wales Labor MPs have expressed disquiet over their party’s support for a bill that would see protesters who block major roads, ports or train stations face up to two years in prison. The NSW government arranged a special sitting of parliament on Friday after it failed to pass the bill following a late-night filibuster by the Greens. Introduced this week after a series of climate protests targeting Port Botany, the Roads and Crimes Legislation Amendment bill 2022 introduces fines of up to $22,000 and up to two years in prison for anyone who causes “damage or disruption” on major roads or other “major facilities” such as ports or railway stations. Despite alarm from unions, environmental groups and human rights organisations, as well as questions about the bill’s constitutionality, the government is determined for the bill to pass this week before parliament rises for a month. Labor has moved a series of amendments to carve out industrial action from the bill. Other amendments, including one which exempted “peaceful protest” from the bill, was opposed by the government and defeated on Friday morning. Despite that, Labor has committed to supporting the legislation, prompting some MPs to privately express unhappiness that the opposition leader, Chris Minns, declared the party’s support for it before it was discussed in the party’s caucus. During a late-night sitting on Thursday, a number of Labor backbenchers, including left faction members and former trade union official Anthony D’Adam, made clear their discomfort with supporting the bill. “I have put my body in front of cars and I have obstructed traffic, and so I feel the legislation is a profound challenge to the rights I have exercised in my political life,” D’Adam said. “I am concerned about the narrative the house has adopted in the debate. Direct action is an old form of protest. Suffragettes chained themselves to Parliament House in a form of direct action not dissimilar to the kinds of direct action the bill is trying to criminalise. “I am concerned about the proportionality of the approach in the bill.” Veteran Labor MP Peter Primrose also expressed disquiet about the bill, telling parliament he would support it because the party’s caucus had already made the decision. He questioned why the government had taken such a hard line on the climate activists – including the establishment of a police strike force – but not anti-lockdown protests which occurred throughout Sydney last year. “It is unclear why this particular protest is worthy of its own strike force given the range of protests, including violent protests, that we have seen across the state, including by a number of far right groups who not only cause property damage and inconvenience to the public but also engage in outright violence against the police and other emergency services personnel and other members of the public,” he said. Despite the government winning Labor’s support for the bill, a late-night filibuster by the NSW Greens prevented the bill passing on Thursday. Instead, the government ordered a rare special adjournment forcing the parliament to sit through Friday in an attempt to pass the legislation. The Greens intend to move a swathe of amendments in a bid to delay the bill, and that debate was continuing on Friday. The government says the bill is necessary to target a series of climate protesters who have caused disruption at Port Botany and on the Spit Bridge in Manly in recent weeks. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The roads minister, Natalie Ward, insisted the bill would not target “legal” protests, and the government has also amended the bill to exclude “spontaneous protest”, at the request of some Coalition MPs. But she said the climate protests had caused “significant inconvenience” to the state and claimed the cost was “estimated to run into the millions of dollars through direct economic loss and lost productivity”. “I sat on the Spit Bridge that morning and I felt it like every other commuter around me,” she said on Thursday. “I saw people sitting in their cars with their schoolchildren trying to get to school … [The protests] have been repeated, and we are on notice that those protesters will continue to repeat their disruptive protests.”",News/Australia news,NSW Labor MPs uneasy about party’s support for bill aimed at road-blocking protests,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/nsw-labor-mps-uneasy-about-partys-support-for-bill-aimed-at-road-blocking-protests
4/1/2022,"Respite from gloomy weather is finally on the way for Sydney, but not before it is battered by damaging winds and dangerous surf conditions. Severe weather warnings for damaging winds, damaging surf and high tides were issued on Friday morning, covering much of the New South Wales coastline. Sydney can look forward to three days of sunshine after the wind though, with the Bureau of Meteorology forecasting warm weather and little chance of rain from Sunday to Tuesday. Monday’s forecast of zero rain will be a welcome reprieve for a city battered by storms and heavy rainfall for weeks. But across Friday and Saturday, the bureau is warning that gusts of around 100km/h are possible from Newcastle all the way down to the South Coast. Gusts measuring 102km/h were recorded at Murrurundi in the Upper Hunter region at 9.27pm on Thursday, while Cabramurra in the Snowy Mountains recorded a 98km/h wind gust at around 4am on Friday. The winds could pose an increased risk, as soil saturated from days of rainfall could lead to gusts toppling trees and powerlines. A hazardous surf warning has been issued for the entirety of the state’s coastline, with the BoM warning that waves in excess of five metres could persist into Saturday morning. The bureau is urging people not to go near the water, saying Port Macquarie, Taree, Newcastle, Sydney, Wollongong and Batemans Bay will all be affected. The strong waves could also affect beachside properties, with the bureau warning of coastal erosion and localised damage also continuing into Saturday.

NSW police issued their own warning on Friday morning, saying Sydneysiders should stay out of the water and away from walking near surf-exposed areas. “Rock fishers should avoid coastal rock platforms exposed to the ocean and seek a safe location that is sheltered from the surf.” “Boaters planning to cross shallow water and ocean bars should consider changing or delaying their voyage,” the NSW police force Marine Area Command said in the statement. “Boaters should remember to log on with their local Marine Rescue radio base, via VHF Radio or the Marine Rescue App, and consider their safety management plan.” The NSW State Emergency Services are urging people to be wary of the wind, to move their vehicles from under trees and to secure loose items around the house. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a statement, the NSW SES said residents should avoid fallen power lines, and remain vigilant amid the dangerous conditions. “Keep at least eight metres away from fallen power lines or objects that may be energised, such as fences.” “Trees that have been damaged by fire [from fallen power lines] are likely to be more unstable and more likely to fall. Stay vigilant and monitor conditions.” Flood warnings are still in place along the Wilsons River at Lismore, but it is expected to fall below moderate flood levels on Friday evening. Waters are receding at Grafton, Ulmarra and Maclean, with flood waters also likely to drop, however the Orara River at Coutts Crossing is expected to remain above the moderate flood level throughout Friday.",News/Australia news,Wild winds and surf in NSW to finally give way to reprieve from stormy weather,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/wild-winds-and-surf-in-nsw-to-finally-give-way-to-reprieve-from-stormy-weather
