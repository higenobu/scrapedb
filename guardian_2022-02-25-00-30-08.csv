2/25/2022,"Hundreds of Ukrainians, many clad in their national colours of yellow and blue, have gathered outside the gates of Downing Street to protest against Russia’s invasion of their country. But while shock, anger and defiance were among the common sentiments, events in the early hours of Thursday morning had also heralded difficult personal dilemmas for many such as Aleksandra Legosteva, a tech worker, and her mother, Olena, who had come to visit on Saturday.  “I don’t want her to go back,” said Legosteva, who told of a largely sleepless night as the family monitored Russia’s invasion and worried about relatives in northern Ukraine who were now stockpiling food and other supplies. Like others, she was eager for the UK government step up and imposed “sweeping sanctions” on Russia while calls for military assistance and British military boots on the grounds was a common refrain among the crowd outside Downing Street. Yuriy Yurchuk, 35, a principal singer at the Royal Opera House, said he had been due to perform at Moscow’s Bolshoi theatre in two weeks time but that would now not happen. “There’s still a place for talking but there should be a comprehensive response to what is happening in Ukraine, including a military one and also international condemnation. Otherwise what is the UN for?” added Yurchuk. Ukrainian flags, large and small, were meanwhile scattered throughout the crowd, along with homemade placards variously condemning Vladimir Putin as a war criminal or drawing a link between his regime and that of the Soviet Union. The bishop of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of the Holy Family of London, the Right Rev Kenneth Nowakowski, was among those who had gathered. “I don’t want to criticise the British government because we’re grateful for what they’ve done so far but there is so much more that can and should be done now,” he said. “It’s also worth remembering that this is a war that has been going on for eight years now. The rest of the world is now waking up to it and the fact that Putin may not just stop at Ukraine.” Dennis Ougrin, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist at Queen Mary University of London, was meanwhile eager to get back to Ukraine to help with what he said would be the inevitable toll on his country’s very youngest as a result of the Russian bombardment. “It’s horrific but, as we know from Russian actions before, the type of offensive they undertake really strikes fear into children in particular. I’m thinking the children in Ukrainian orphanages who’ve had to take shelter underground while missile and artillery attacks take place,” he said. While those gathered were almost entirely Ukrainian, a small group of young Russians working in in sectors ranging from IT to fashion were also present, though they declined to give their names – such were their concerns at the consequences of speaking out against Putin. “I literally couldn’t look at my colleagues in the eye this morning,” said one woman, who spoke of a feeling of shame. Alongside her were friends who had taken part in some of the last major protests against the Putin regime in Moscow before the clampdown on the opposition movement led by Alexei Navalny. They spoke of mixed feelings among their compatriots living in the UK, saying they included a rich elite that was in hock to Putin’s nationalism but also many who were just as disgusted as they were about the invasion and his stranglehold on their country. “It’s a feeling of shame that this is being done in our name,” said another, with tears in her eyes.",News/UK news,Ukrainians protest at Downing Street gates over Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/24/ukrainians-protest-at-downing-street-gates-over-russian-invasion-uk-military-sanctions
2/25/2022,"In the wake of what the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, described as Russia’s “fully fledged invasion of Ukraine”, the west has to decide how to respond to what France’s Emmanuel Macron has called a turning point in European history. Yet can the west now offer Ukraine more than a mixture of prayers, sanctions and diplomatic demarches? Throughout this conflict western intelligence has shown it has been able to predict Putin’s next step, but less capable of stopping it. Boris Johnson told the Ukrainian people “we are with you”, but what this western solidarity means in practice is now up for debate.  The 30-nation Nato alliance will stick to its pledge that it will never send forces to protect Ukraine as a non-Nato member. Backbench Tory calls to give Ukraine air support have no support in Nato. Instead the west will test Russia’s resolve through tough sanctions and by some countries providing arms if there is a resistance. The coordinated sanctions in Washington, London, Berlin and Brussels being announced on Thursday are billed as massive, but Putin sits on a $600bn (£450bn) war chest and will benefit from oil prices soaring past $100 a barrel. That makes him less dependent on the west to raise capital than five years ago, and such is his dominance of the Russian media that the chances of internal protests pressurising, let alone toppling, the 69-year-old president look minimal. The oligarchs may complain if sanctions are placed on them, but Putin is in too deep to retreat. One London-based diplomat said this week after viewing Russia’s televised and cowed national security meeting “We used to talk about Putin’s inner circle. There is no inner circle. There is only Putin”. Another said “the only thing that will change Russian public opinion is the mothers of Russia seeing the bodybags”. Nikolai Petrov from the Chatham House thinktank warned “all infrastructure of political opponents and opposition has been destroyed, making it much easier for the Kremlin to to mobilise public opinion”. Dire predictions by the British of Putin being mired in a battlefield quagmire will now be tested. Many Ukrainians appear on western media to attest Putin has underestimated Ukraine’s will to fight. They insist they will not tolerate a puppet government loyal to Moscow. But the long queues of traffic fleeing Kyiv in the westward direction speaks to another story. It is as likely Ukraine’s prisons will be filled with dissidents. In the short term there will be a debate, including in Germany, whether to arm the resistance, with some Green party and CDU leaders already advocating this. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, at the weekend said this was not the moment for Germany to make a 180-degree turn on such a strategic policy. Yet the debate is live. The former German defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said “I’m so angry at us for historically failing. After Georgia, Crimea and Donbas, we have not prepared anything that would have really deterred Putin”. Keir Giles, also from Chatham House, urged the west to be cautious. “Looking at Russia’s 100% success record on suppressing resistance movements in territories it has occupied – often using medieval levels of savagery and inflicting terror on the civilian population – we ask what would aid to a resistance achieve and would it make the situation better worse or better.” The images of destruction in Aleppo, Grozny and Afghanistan shows how merciless the Russian military can be. Stoltenberg has said that it is a matter for individual nations to decide the help they provide to any resistance. But the risks are high. In his speech announcing the invasion, Putin warned outsiders tempted to interfere that there would be “consequences you have never encountered in your history” – a chilling veiled reference to nuclear war. There is also a danger that an insurgency would exacerbate a refugee crisis likely to be triggered across central Europe. Plans are in infancy in the EU’s Frontex border agency to prepare for an influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees. Some diplomats are optimistic that unlike with Syria in 2015, there will not be a political backlash, pointing out many Ukrainians have already been welcomed to Europe. As many as 15,000 Ukrainians already live in Berlin. But autocrats have learned refugees are weapons of war. The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has been clear that there is a serious risk that Putin, judging by his words, will not stop at Ukraine, but wants to restore Russia’s empire, and remove western forces from all former Warsaw Pact countries. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, has also warned Putin has gone “full tonto”, and almost every western politician who returned from Moscow was disturbed by his demeanour and inability to focus on realistic solutions to the crisis. It means once Ukraine is swallowed by Putin, Russia will be able to station forces – land, air and missile – in bases in western Ukraine as well as Belarus, which has effectively lost independence. He may not invade the Baltic states, but he is in a better strategic position to demand a retreat by Nato to Warsaw Pact boundaries and a land corridor through Poland to link Kaliningrad, the headquarters of the Russian Baltic fleet. It will mean high defence spending, less dependence on Russian energy and more troops on Nato’s frontiers. Finland and Sweden may seek to join Nato. If Putin wanted less Nato, he may get more. Finally, the west has to confront questions about the validity of the whole postwar diplomatic security architecture. On Wednesday night UN diplomats gathered to condemn Russia at an emergency meeting, one chaired by Russia, this month’s presidents of the UN security council. It symbolised the degree to which the UN has become utterly compromised. But there may have been one diplomatic voice in New York that will disturb the west most – that of the Chinese envoy. In his brief remarks he remained studiously on the fence, refusing to condemn Russia and knowing the west’s anguish may provide it with nothing but opportunities ahead.",News/World news,What can the west do about Russia invading Ukraine? ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/russia-invading-ukraine-putin-nato-what-can-west-do
2/25/2022,"Thousands of Ukrainians are already on the move and leaving the country, with tens of thousands more preparing to flee, after the Russian attack ordered by Vladimir Putin. Videos and photos on social media show lines of cars moving out of cities and heading west, as well as an increase of people on foot near the southern and western borders.  The United Nations refugee agency said on Thursday that the situation was quickly deteriorating after Russia’s invasion. It appealed to neighbouring countries to keep their borders open to people seeking a safe haven. “We have already seen reports of casualties and people starting to flee their homes to seek safety,” said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees. Reuters reported dozens of people, some carrying luggage and accompanied by children, crossing into the Polish city of Medyka, and lines of cars stretching for miles were reported on the approach to Ukraine’s border with Moldova. The UNHCR said it had stepped up its operations and was working with Ukrainian authorities to provide greater humanitarian assistance. It was also working with governments in neighbouring countries “calling on them to keep borders open to those seeking safety and protection”, it said. For weeks, central European countries on Ukraine’s western border have been making preparations for a potential influx of millions of refugees. Authorities in the countries next to Ukraine have already identified border crossings through which people can leave the country by land, such as Vyšné Nemecké in Slovakia, Záhony in Hungary, Siret in Romania, and Palanca in Moldova. Maia Sandu, the president of Moldova, said on Thursday there was an increase in traffic flow on the border. Poland is preparing a train, with medical equipment, to transport wounded civilians from the Ukrainian border to Polish hospitals, said the country’s health minister. “We are preparing a sanitary train with full rescue service and medical equipment to transport the injured,” said Adam Niedzielski. “This solution was created completely from scratch and, so far, has not been used in Poland. At the same time, we already have a list of 120 hospitals throughout the country to which victims may go. In total, we estimate at the moment that it would be possible to admit several thousand patients.” Poland, in particular, has been preparing for various scenarios, including a wave of up to a million people fleeing Ukraine, said Maciej Wąsik, the deputy interior minister. Poland is already home to about 2 million Ukrainians, many of whom moved after the 2014 conflict, and they have taken advantage of a relatively easy scheme to gain work permits. The government has said it is planning to house Ukrainian refugees in hostels, dormitories and sports facilities. A few days ago, local authorities in the countries bordering Ukraine were asked to indicate the list of accommodation facilities for refugees, the number of people it would be possible to accommodate, the costs involved and the timeframe for the adaptation of buildings. The ground floor of the exhibition centre in the south-eastern Polish city of Rzeszów has been equipped to receive people who may flee Ukraine, about 30 miles to the east. Germany has said it will offer support to countries in eastern and central Europe, especially Poland, facing an influx of refugees. German media have cited estimates that between 200,000 and a million people may flee to the EU from Ukraine in the event of a war. “We will offer massive support to the affected states – especially our neighbour Poland – in the event of large refugee movements,” the interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said in a statement, adding she had been in touch with the Polish government and the European Commission. Franziska Giffey, the mayor of Berlin, told news outlet RBB 24 that the German capital was preparing for the arrival of refugees. “For next week, we have set ourselves the goal of discussing concrete implications, what preparations we can make, especially in the event of people fleeing this situation,” Giffey said. Other countries in Europe have offered support to countries in eastern Europe in case of a wave of refugees leaving Ukraine. António Costa, the prime minister of Portugal, said potential refugees from Ukraine were welcome in the Iberian country, home to a large Ukrainian community. “Ukrainian citizens who have family, friends and acquaintances here are welcome in Portugal,” Costa said, promising to facilitate the issuance of entry visas.",News/World news,Thousands of Ukrainians flee country after Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/ukraine-russia-flee-country-invasion
2/25/2022,"The Co-operative Bank has more than tripled its bonus pot for bankers after a “milestone year” that resulted in its first profit in a decade. The ethical lender, which has struggled to turn a profit since 2011, announced it was paying bankers a total of £13.3m in bonuses for 2021, more than twice the size of the £4.2m bonus pot shared among its more than 3,200 staff in 2020.  Its chief executive, Nick Slape, who is the sixth boss to run the bank over the past nine years, said the payouts were “completely appropriate” given the lender’s return to profit. “There’s been a huge amount of effort 24/7 to make this happen, so I think is appropriate,” he said. “The bar has been set for 2022, and if we don’t deliver … then that won’t be the sort of number you see [next year].” Slape took home a bonus worth nearly £1.2m, bringing his total pay to £2.4m for 2021. The bank’s annual pre-tax profit of £31m, up from a £104m loss in 2020, marks the first time it reported a profit since 2011, when its earnings were £54m. The bank benefited from a jump in mortgage applications and well as its cost-cutting programme last year. Like other banks, it also put aside much smaller amount of cash to help cushion the blow from the pandemic, compared to 2020. The strong financial performance suggests the bank is starting to emerge from its near-decade of troubles. The depth of its financial difficulties first came to light in 2013 when a £1.5bn hole was discovered in its accounts following its disastrous takeover of the Britannia building society in 2009. The problem resulted in the bank being rescued by a group of hedge funds, which have since taken control of the lender. Its reputation also suffered after the former chairman, the former Labour councillor and Methodist church minister Paul Flowers – nicknamed the Crystal Methodist – pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine in 2014. Slape said he expected the bank to report an even higher profit in 2022, which marks the bank’s 150th anniversary. “Our return to profitability and balance sheet growth at improved margins gives us a strong platform for further growth in the years ahead,” he said.",News/Business,Co-op Bank triples bonus pot after turning first profit since 2011,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/co-op-bank-triples-bonus-pot-after-turning-first-profit-since-2011
2/25/2022,"With Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine under way, the Kremlin’s grip on the gas taps and pipelines that supply heat and electricity to millions of homes and businesses in Europe is all too apparent. Gas is already in tight supply globally and has reached record market price highs in recent months.  In the UK, this has triggered a full-blown energy crisis, including the collapse of multiple electricity suppliers and a rise in household gas and electricity bills that has contributed to a growing cost-of-living squeeze. As Russia began its assault on Ukraine, prices surged again. The UK benchmark was up 32% to 281p per therm on Thursday, while the closely watched Dutch future gained 31% on contracts for March delivery. So, could Europe’s energy crisis become a catastrophe? “We must collectively cease the dependence on Russian oil and gas that for too long has given Putin his grip on western politics,” Boris Johnson said on Thursday. The good news, for the UK’s security of supply at least, is that less than 5% of our gas comes from Russian imports. About half comes from vast, though rapidly dwindling, North Sea reserves. Another third is sourced from Norway, while the rest comes in via pipelines connecting the UK to Europe, or in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is transported by tankers typically from Qatar or the US. All of this means, according to a report by the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies, that Britain is “unlikely to face a physical shortage of supplies”. The bad news is that Russia typically supplies 30-40% of Europe’s gas, meaning it still wields huge influence over prices, which are already eye-wateringly high. The UK’s market is closely connected to markets in Europe, so a price rise in Germany or the Netherlands means British suppliers must pay more to get hold of it. In January, the US bank Goldman Sachs said it expected gas prices to be twice as high as normal until 2025 and that was before Russia launched its attack on Ukraine. Nor can the UK turn to stored reserves of gas for relief from market prices. Storage capacity is very low by international standards since British Gas’s owner, Centrica, shut down the Rough facility off the coast of Yorkshire. Very. Russian gas flows into Europe via a complex network of pipelines that run through Ukraine, Belarus and Poland to Germany, including Yamal and Nord Stream 1. From Germany, pipelines carry gas to the rest of western Europe and through to the UK. If war in Ukraine were to damage or choke off those supply lines, it could cause severe market volatility and a shutdown of European factories to help conserve gas. “It’s possible to use other routes, particularly the Yamal pipeline through Poland and Germany,” said Michael Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick Business School. “But that depends on Russia being willing to do that.” So far, the government has stuck to the line that “thanks to our diverse mix of nuclear, natural gas and renewable technologies, the UK has one of the most reliable energy systems in the world”. But while security of supply does not appear to be at risk, price pressure could have huge ramifications. The efforts of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to help households cope with rising costs involves giving them £200 off their energy bills, with this “loan” paid back at a rate of £40 a year over five years from 2023. The idea is that part of the cost is postponed until markets return to normal. If the Ukraine conflict is prolonged, prices could remain higher for longer, meaning bills will still be high when households have to start repaying the government. When it comes to securing alternative supplies, LNG from the US and Qatar is one option. Officials were reportedly in talks late last year with Qatar over a deal that could result in the gas-rich nation supplying extra cargoes of gas in the event of an energy emergency, according to the Financial Times. But the government denied requesting that Qatar act as a “supplier of last resort”. Bradshaw warns that if LNG become a fallback option for Europe and the UK, particularly amid increasing demand for it in Asia, the maths might not add up. “The problem might then be that there isn’t enough LNG to make up for shortage of pipeline gas,” he said. “We’re in uncharted territory.” At 280p per therm, UK short-term gas prices are already more than seven times higher than this time last year and Tom Marzec-Manser, a senior gas expert at ICIS, thinks they could return to the record levels above 450p, reached in December last year. “I don’t think it’s unreasonable to believe that gas markets could return to the highs we saw late last year if things were to escalate to the point that gas supplies were affected,” Marzec-Manser said. For now, a few lucky breaks have helped to keep soaring gas markets in check, he added. Gas demand in Asia is lower, which allowed Europe to receive a record number of LNG deliveries from January. However, a major gas supply disruption could be enough to cause gas prices to soar back to record levels and the weather is always a factor. “We’ve got to hope we don’t have another cold spell,” said Bradshaw.",News/Business,How will Russia’s assault on Ukraine affect UK gas supplies?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/how-will-russia-assault-ukraine-affect-uk-gas-supplies
2/25/2022,"Unless Andris Nelsons is intending to record “Die Nullte” (the D minor symphony Bruckner composed in 1869 between the first and second numbered works), this will be the final instalment in his cycle with the Leipzig orchestra, which has unfolded in parallel with his Shostakovich series across the Atlantic in Boston. Like the previous instalments, the performances of the First and Fifth Symphonies are taken from concerts in the Gewandhaus over the last three years, and like the previous instalments, too, the set is bulked out with bleeding chunks of Wagner, in this case the Prelude and Liebestod (without the soprano soloist) from Tristan und Isolde.  The First Symphony was first performed in 1868, but Bruckner revised the score in the early 1890s, though the changes he made were relatively slight. It’s that final version that Nelsons conducts, and its generally extrovert nature well suits his approach to Bruckner – buoyant and as transparent as the scoring allows. He’s at his most convincing in the outer movements, in which his refusal to over-emphasise any detail and willingness to allow the music to flow as naturally as possible pays dividends. There are moments in the slow movement, though, when he appears to get carried away by the lyrical beauty of the music and the way in which the velvety Gewandhaus strings shape it so that the performance loses direction and, temporarily at least, its focus. Such lapses are an intermittent problem in the great spans of the Fifth Symphony, too, but they do have to be balanced against the sheer beauty of much of the performance; the magical opening bars of the first movement, emerging almost surreptitiously out of silence and steadily coming alive, set the standard of refinement for what follows. Nelsons may downplay the majesty of some of Bruckner’s climaxes, but his view of the work is undeniably an individual one. Christian Thielemann had hardly completed his Bruckner cycle on DVD and CD with the Dresden Staatskapelle than he began another, this time with the Vienna Philharmonic for Sony Classical, and scheduled to be completed in time for the composer’s bicentenary in two years’ time. The Second is the third symphony to appear, in an account that is as secure and all-embracing as one would expect from a conductor who regards Bruckner as a central pillar of his repertoire, and an orchestra with a peerless pedigree in performing these works. Thielemann’s approach is never heavy-handed or over-emphatic, but its traditional solidity contrasts sharply with Nelsons’ performances, which are, I suspect, ones more likely to convince the Bruckner agnostics.",Arts/Music,"Bruckner: Symphonies Nos 1 and 5, etc review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/24/bruckner-symphonies-nos-1-and-5-etc-review-andris-nelsons
2/25/2022,"Hello Fight to vote Readers,  I have an update in my reporting on the case of Pamela Moses, the 44-year-old Black Lives Matter Activist in Memphis who was sentenced to six years in prison for trying to register to vote. The case has attracted significant national attention because many see Moses’ sentence as too severe and a clear example of disparities in the US criminal justice system. The prosecution’s case is built around the argument that Moses knew she was ineligible to vote because she was on probation, and people on felony probation in Tennessee cannot vote. Indeed, a few months before she tried to register, a judge had issued an order telling Moses her probation was ongoing. But nevertheless, prosecutors argued, she convinced a probation officer into signing a form saying she was eligible to vote and then knowingly submitted the document knowing it was false. “You tricked the probation department into giving you documents saying you were off probation,” W Mark Ward, the judge who sentenced Moses, said in January. Moses, for her part, told me she did now know she was ineligible and her lawyers have said she went to the probation office genuinely seeking clarity about whether she could vote. A new email I obtained through a public records request adds to evidence undercutting the claim that Moses tricked the officer. In September 2019, just two days after a probation officer mistakenly signed a certificate telling Moses her probation was complete, officials at the Tennessee department of corrections investigated how exactly their employee made the error. Their investigation didn’t find that Moses had deceived a probation officer, but rather that the officer had made a good-faith mistake. The review found that the probation officer – referred to as Manager Billington – spent about an hour investigating whether Moses was still on probation. Billington came across a note in Moses’ file noting that in 2016, she had been placed on supervised probation for two years. Even though the system said that Moses remained on unsupervised probation, Billington thought this was a mistake. The person who handled the file, he believed, forgot to close out the case when the supervised probation ran out. That’s why he ultimately signed Moses’ voting certificate saying her probation had expired in 2018 and she was eligible to vote. “Manager Billington advised that he thought he did due diligence in making his decision,” Joe Williams, an administrator in the department of corrections, wrote to Lisa Helton, a top department official. “Manager Billington failed to adequately investigate the status of this case. He failed to review all of the official documents available through the Shelby county justice portal and negligently relied on a contact note from a court specialist in 2016.” Williams went on to note that if Billington had looked harder, he would have found additional documents, issued in 2019, that said Moses was on probation. Williams conceded that it was “tedious” to find some of that information. “The information that Manager Billington had at the time he signed the Voters Restoration was insufficient to reasonably affirm that an offender was off supervision.” The email says that Moses waited in the lobby of the probation office and seemed impatient while Billington investigated. It does not suggest that Moses bore responsibility for the mistake. “They acknowledged that the mistake was theirs in this letter,” said Blair Bowie, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, who is advising Moses’ defense on voting rights restoration issues. “This really runs contrary to the prosecution’s characterization of the incident as Ms Moses tricking the probation officer.” Claiborne Ferguson, the attorney who represented Moses during her trial, said he had not seen the email before I showed it to him Wednesday morning. He said it was consistent with Billington’s testimony during Moses’ trial in which he accepted responsibility for the error. Amy Weirich, the district attorney prosecuting the case, declined an interview request. “I gave her a chance to plead to a misdemeanor with no prison time. She requested a jury trial instead. She set this unfortunate result in motion and a jury of her peers heard the evidence and convicted her,” she said in a statement. Any acknowledgment of an error from the probation department is potentially significant because it challenges the argument that Moses knowingly voted illegally, experts said. “Mistake of fact is never a defense. But one of the major exceptions is if you’re relying on someone who is officially responsible for telling you whether you’re breaking the law or not then you’re not guilty of a crime,” Bennett Capers, a former federal prosecutor who is now a law professor at Fordham University, told me. When he sentenced Moses, Ward dismissed the idea that an error by the probation department meant Moses wasn’t guilty of a crime. Such an argument, he said, is like saying “a person who obtains money from a bank by posing as another person is not criminally responsible because the bank should have discovered the fraud and not given the money to the thief.” Steven Mulroy, a law professor at the University of Memphis who specializes in criminal and election law, told me he didn’t think that analogy was appropriate. “She was honest about who she was, and she knew that probation would check her records,” said Mulroy, who is also running for district attorney. “A better analogy would be the central bank branch said she had insufficient funds for a check; she doubted it and thought it might be a mistake. She went to her actual bank branch, who checked their records, said she had sufficient funds, and issued her a money order which she then tried to cash.” After reviewing the email, I asked the department of corrections whether it believed Moses had deceived its employee. An agency spokesperson didn’t answer directly. “I can only say that the officer did not conduct a complete review and should not have signed the form, said Dorinda Carter, a department spokesperson. “Corrective action was taken against the officer who mistakenly completed the form.” Bowie said the case spoke to wider problems with the confusing process people with felonies have to go through to get their voting rights restored. “The cost of those mistakes is always paid by the person trying to restore their voting rights,” she said.

2/25/2022,"A previously unpublished novel by Leonard Cohen is due for publication this autumn. Written in Montreal in 1956 – the year Cohen published his first poetry collection – A Ballet of Lepers focuses on “toxic relationships and the lengths one will go to maintain them”, according to a press release.  As detailed in the Cohen biography Various Positions by Ira B Nadel, the 91-page book “tells the story of a 35-year-old sales clerk who takes in his elderly grandfather” to live together in a cramped boarding house … The grandfather is given to fits of violence, and the narrator (who remains unnamed) finds an awakening violence within himself.” It opens with the lines: “My grandfather came to live with me. There was nowhere else for him to go. What had happened to all his children? Death, decay, exile – I hardly know.” The novel demonstrated “a growing sense of Jewish history and tragedy”, wrote Nadel, a theme that would develop in Cohen’s subsequent poetry, and reflected the “difficulties that Cohen faced with his own senile grandfather, although without the degree of violence”. The book was originally rejected by two publishers. Cohen, who died in 2016, once said that A Ballet of Lepers was “probably a better novel” than his celebrated first novel, The Favourite Game, published in 1963. The new publication of the novel will be accompanied by 15 short stories and the script for a radio play from Cohen’s archives, all written between 1956 and 1961, and titled A Ballet of Lepers: A Novel and Stories. The works explore themes “from shame and unworthiness to sexual desire in all its sacred and profane dimensions to longing, whether for love, family, freedom, or transcendence”, and “probe the inner demons of his characters, many of whom could function as stand-ins for the author himself.” The collection was assembled by Cohen scholar Alexandra Pleshoyano, who has written an afterword. Robert Kory, trustee of the Leonard Cohen family trust, said: “Leonard said before his death that his life’s true masterwork was his archive, which he kept meticulously for the benefit of fans and scholars one day to discover. I’m pleased that, with this book, his readers and listeners can begin that rich journey.” Canongate will publish A Ballet of Lepers: A Novel and Stories in the UK on 11 October 2022.",Arts/Music,Leonard Cohen: previously unpublished novel to be released in autumn,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/24/leonard-cohen-previously-unpublished-novel-to-be-released-in-autumn
2/25/2022,"The Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, was identified by the Home Office in 2019 as having links to the Russian state as well as to “corrupt activity and practices”, a Labour MP has told parliament, suggesting the UK should seize his assets and bar him from owning the football club. Chris Bryant told MPs he was quoting from a Home Office document leaked to him, and asked why nothing more had been done about Abramovich’s UK assets given this official verdict.  Raising the issue of tier 1 visas, the sort held by Abramovich, which allow very rich people to invest in the UK, Bryant directly quoted a section of what he said was the Home Office document. “I’ve got hold of a leaked document from 2019, from the Home Office, which says in relation to Mr Abramovich: ‘As part of HMG’s [Her Majesty’s government] Russia strategy aimed at targeting illicit finance and malign activity, Abramovich remains of interest to HMG due to his links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices,’” Bryant told the Commons. He went on, still quoting the document: “‘An example of this is Abramovich admitting in court proceedings that he paid for political influence. Therefore HMG is focused on ensuring individuals linked to illicit finance and malign activity are unable to base themselves in the UK, and will use the relevant tools at its disposal, including immigration powers, to prevent this.’” Bryant added: “That’s nearly three years ago. And yet remarkably little has been done. Surely Mr Abramovich should no longer be able to own a football club in this country? Surely we should be looking at seizing some of his assets, including his £150m home, and making sure that other people who have had tier 1 visas like this are not engaged in malign activity in the UK?” Abramovich, who made his fortune acquiring newly privatised Russian oil assets following the end of the Soviet Union, bought Chelsea in 2003 and has put enormous sums into the club. In 2018 he withdrew his application for a new UK investor visa, amid worsening links between the UK and Russia. Abramovich has an Israeli passport and has since travelled to the UK using that. A week ago the government said it was ending the tier 1 visa system over concerns it allowed people to invest “dirty money” in the UK. On Tuesday, speaking to the Commons as he announced a first wave of measures against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, Boris Johnson said Abramovich was “already facing sanctions” because of links to the Russian state. However, Downing Street later said the prime minister had made an error, and formally corrected the record. Abramovich has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit sanctions being imposed against him. Bryant cannot be sued for quoting the report and its claims about Abramovich, as statements in the Commons are protected by parliamentary privilege. Abramovich’s representatives were contacted for comment.",News/World news,"Roman Abramovich linked to Russian state and ‘corrupt activity’, MP says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/roman-abramovich-linked-to-russian-state-and-corrupt-activity-mp-says
2/25/2022,"Former co-stars of the late actor and comedian Jerry Lewis have accused him of sexual assault and sexual harassment. The women all met Lewis when he was at the height of his Hollywood career. In an investigation by Vanity Fair and accompanying short film, they allege Lewis – who died of natural causes in 2017 aged 91, had mistreated them.  The story and film are based in part on interviews conducted by Emmy-winning Allen v Farrow film-makers, Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick, who have been investigating Hollywood’s long history of abuse. They found that some of the most explosive accusations involved Lewis. Among those interviewed are Hope Holiday, who starred alongside Lewis in The Ladies Man, Jill St John, who starred opposite Lewis in Who’s Minding the Store?, Anna Maria Alberghetti, who worked with him on Cinderfella, Karen Sharpe, who played Lewis’s love interest in The Disorderly Orderly, Oscar-nominated writer Renée Taylor, and singer Lainie Kazan. Sharpe, now 87, alleged that after a costume fitting in his office in 1964, Lewis physically assaulted her. “He grabbed me. He began to fondle me. He unzipped his pants. Quite frankly, I was dumbstuck,” she said. “I put my hand up and said, ‘Wait a minute. I don’t know if this is a requirement for your leading ladies, but this is something I don’t do.’ I could see that he was furious. I got the feeling that that never really happened to him.” Sharpe alleged that after she rebuffed Lewis, he refused to rehearse with her and forbade the entire production, bar the director and assistant director, from speaking to her. “If anyone speaks to you … we’ll be fined,” a crew member allegedly told her. Holiday, 91, said she had known Lewis since she was 13 but was in her early 30s when he allegedly invited her to his dressing room, locked her in and began to “talk dirty” and masturbate. “He said, ‘You’ve got a great figure, you’ve got nice boobs, you’ve got lovely legs. That’s what I like to see,’” Holiday said. “I didn’t know what to do, so I just sat there. I wanted to leave so badly. I wanted to get out of there, and I couldn’t.” She said the incident made her depressed. “I didn’t want to go on dates. It wasn’t good.” Holiday said her friends urged her to report Lewis to the Screen Actors Guild but she was too afraid. “He was very big at Paramount. I was under contract to him and to Paramount, and I didn’t want to shake the boat. I figured I’ll just keep my mouth shut.” Taylor, 88, said she was in her 20s when Lewis arranged a meeting for her with Paramount executives, who immediately asked her if she was “one of Jerry’s Girls”. When she said no, she alleges they began speaking crudely about her anatomy and that of Lewis. “They said, ‘Well, how big is your pussy? Jerry has a salami and will use it on a girl’,” Taylor said. Lewis’s comedy and singing duo with Dean Martin propelled him to stardom on par with Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. He married singer Patti Palmer in 1944 and the couple had six children together. He later adopted another child with his second wife, SanDee Pitnick. In 1959, at the age of 33, he signed a seven-year contract with Paramount for $10m, the largest contract of its kind between a studio and performer at the time. The Vanity Fair film, titled The Dark Side of a Hollywood Icon, was released on Wednesday.",Arts/Film,Jerry Lewis co-stars accuse late star of sexual abuse,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/24/jerry-lewis-co-stars-accuse-late-star-of-sexual-abuse
