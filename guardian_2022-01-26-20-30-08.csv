1/26/2022,"My friend and colleague Fraser Woodburn, who has died aged 70 of cancer, was a top administrator in UK higher education for more than two decades. From 1977 to 1980, he carried out various roles in university administration at the University of Stirling. He then moved to Edinburgh University (1980-88), where he held administrative appointments with responsibility for postgraduate affairs, computing policy and, latterly, planning and resource allocation. Fraser was also academic registrar at Hull (1988-92), and university secretary at Essex (1992-98).  He served his longest tenure (1999-2015) as university secretary at the Open University, where he was responsible to the vice-chancellor for the administration of the university and to the council for the governance of the institution. Inspirational and dedicated, Fraser thought in a strategic way that won admiration from all who worked with him. He supported institutions through significant changes and made a huge contribution to the OU. With great deftness he navigated the institution through some very challenging times, particularly the changes in the higher education fees and funding regime in England, when he was pivotal in the university successfully making the case for part-time students to have access to loans on a par with full-time students. Fraser was responsible for unusually complex, panoptic briefs, stretching from governance and finance to government relations and capital projects. Many of the OU’s successes in groundbreaking research, world-class teaching and creative innovation were made possible thanks to his exceptional leadership. Known for his kindness, wit, willingness to listen, astute problem-solving and practical encouragement to staff at all levels, Fraser was a member of Humanists UK. He said the critical factor that had helped him to succeed in life was understanding that many people do difficult things well and make an important contribution. In retirement he became a member of the governing board, and, later, senior independent director, of the University of Suffolk (2016-21). He was also a member of the audit committee of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (2004-10). As well as reaching the pinnacle of his profession, he was a great family man. Born in Ayr, to Anna (nee Hogg) and Alexander, a civil servant, Fraser had a twin brother, Robin, and two older sisters, Rosemary and Sandra. After attending Boroughmuir high school in Edinburgh (1963-69), he graduated in 1973 with a BSc (Hons) in mathematical physics from the University of Edinburgh, where he attended lectures by Peter Higgs, of the Higgs boson. He obtained a diploma in public administration from the Napier College of Commerce and Technology, also in Edinburgh. Fraser met Anne De Roeck, now emeritus professor at the Open University, in 1992, when he first joined the University of Essex, where she was a lecturer in computer science. They married in 2005. He is survived by Anne, his children, Nicola and Graham, from a previous marriage that ended in divorce, by his stepchildren, Max and Emma, grandchildren, Alex, Poppy and Albie, and Robin and Sandra. Rosemary died in 2018.",News/Education,Fraser Woodburn obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/26/fraser-woodburn-obituary
1/26/2022,"Rob Wilkins, Terry Pratchett’s former assistant and friend, is writing the official biography of the late Discworld author, which will move from his childhood to the “embuggerance” of the Alzheimer’s disease he was diagnosed with in 2007. Pratchett was working on his autobiography when he died in 2015, but “following his untimely death from Alzheimer’s disease, the mantle of completing Terry Pratchett’s memoir was passed to Rob”, said publisher Transworld.  It will include “fragments” from the memoir Pratchett was working on before he died, the publisher added. Wilkins, who is now head of Pratchett’s literary estate, worked alongside the author for over 15 years as his assistant and business manager. He has drawn on his own memories, as well as those of Pratchett’s family, friends, fans and colleagues, in writing A Life With Footnotes – the title a nod to the author’s dab hand with an annotation. “The responsibility of documenting his life when I lived so much of it with him has been such an emotive experience. A Life With Footnotes is a book that I hope would have made Terry proud,” said Wilkins. “Living a life alongside one of the world’s greatest authors, then reliving every moment for his biography, has been an incredible journey. Terry was one of the most talented, complex, intellectually stimulating people I’ve ever had the privilege of meeting – a true genius.” The biography will be published in September. Publisher Transworld said it would move from Pratchett being told at the age of six by his headteacher that he would never amount to anything, through the writing of the bestselling Discworld series, his winning the Carnegie medal and his knighthood for services to literature. Wilkins will also cover how Pratchett coped with the challenges of Alzheimer’s. Transworld managing director Larry Finlay said that “only Wilkins” could have written the “intimate, engaging and revealing portrait of one of the UK’s most loved and most missed authors”. “A Life With Footnotes captures the genius that was Terry Pratchett, with warmth, poignancy and great good humour – and with no small amount of love,” said Finlay. “It is a masterclass in great biographical writing.’”",Arts/Books,Official biography of Terry Pratchett to be published ,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/26/official-biography-of-terry-pratchett-to-be-published
1/26/2022,"My father, Graham Pike, who has died aged 82, was an entrepreneur and academic with an infectious enthusiasm for travel, aeroplanes, maps and stamps. His company Green Cuisine Food Products Ltd grew to become one of the country’s leading herb and spice packing businesses. Born in London, the son of Bill Pike, manager of an autoparts company, and his wife, Pearl (nee Owen), who grew up in India, Graham spent his formative years in Leeds. His father’s wartime service in the RAF sparked in Graham a lifelong passion for aviation. Aged 17, he joined the Saunders-Roe aircraft company on the Isle of Wight as an apprentice engineer, going on to study aeronautical engineering at Southampton University, where he learned to fly.  In 1960 Graham’s irrepressible taste for adventure took him first to work in Canada, then across the US by car, before travelling by boat to Sydney, Australia where he completed a PhD in physics and met his future wife, Rhonda Jones, an occupational therapist. In 1966 he hatched a plan to sail back to Britain in the Eilander, a battered old Victorian fishing ketch, with a small crew of fellow adventurers. With little sailing experience and virtually no money they island-hopped around the Pacific to New Guinea and Indonesia, working to pay their way. From Borneo, Graham and Rhonda continued their adventurous journey overland. Arriving in London in late 1967, the couple first lived in a van inside a disused laundry, then in a caravan in the hold of the barge Ironsides, moored near Kew Bridge. When Graham took up a two-year postdoctoral research post in the Physical Chemistry Laboratory in Oxford, where he became a graduate member of St John’s College, they moved to Horspath, a village outside the city, married in 1969 and started a family. They spent a year, 1970-71, in Barcelona, where Graham taught maths, physics and chemistry. On return to Britain they moved to rural Norfolk and Graham worked as a tutor for the newly established Open University. Inspired by their travels and the fact that Graham’s parents had lived in India, my parents had a love of cooking world cuisine. The range of ingredients available in Norfolk at that time was limited and Graham went to London to buy herbs and spices direct from the importers. The wholesale quantities were much more than needed for home use so he started selling the surplus. Before long it became apparent that this sideline was going to be more lucrative than remaining in academia. In 1972 Graham started his own business supplying herbs and spices to shops, restaurants and the public. Early products included a successful range of mail-order curry-making kits, complete with accompanying recipes. The Green Cuisine factory was later established in Watton, Norfolk. Graham and Rhonda renovated the derelict Old Rectory in Foulden as a home for their growing family before finally settling in Norwich. Graham rekindled his interest in sailing and had many boating adventures with his family on the Norfolk Broads. He was a long-term supporter of charities including the 1st Norwich Sea Scouts and Action Village India. He maintained his interest in travel and was always keen to explore new places with family and friends. He is survived by Rhonda, their three children – my siblings, Alistair and Jules, and me – and three grandchildren.",Lifestyle/Food,Graham Pike obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/26/graham-pike-obituary
1/26/2022,"My father, Tony Moulam, who has died aged 94, was a pioneering rock climber and mountaineer. Born in Derby, the son of Albert, a clock repairer, and Mabel (nee Priestley), a housewife, he was rather a solitary child. Receiving a bicycle for his 12th birthday, he cycled out to the Peak District, which was a catalyst to a lifelong love of the outdoors. Tony was inspired by reading Let’s Go Climbing by Colin Kirkus while at Bemrose school, and his expeditions soon centred around scrambling on Derbyshire gritstone.  A chance meeting with Peter Harding, an established climber, at Black Rocks in Cromford, led to serious climbing with hemp ropes. The pair forged a longstanding partnership, tackling numerous climbs in the orbit of their cycle rides and became expert at harder gritstone routes. They employed “hand jams”, necessary when the only feature is a crack in the rock, and my father recalled introducing a young Joe Brown to this developing gritstone art along with Chris Bonington, who remembers Tony as “hugely important” in inspiring his passion for climbing. Volunteering for the army, Tony never saw active service but was commissioned into the Royal Corps of Signals. Posted to Worcestershire, Catterick and finally Vienna, where he oversaw the military telephone exchange, he used every opportunity to pursue his climbing and took advantage of the army’s encouragement to explore the crags and hills. Demobbed in 1948, Tony, with Harding, published A Guide to Black Rocks and Cratcliffe Tor the following year. Tony’s exceptional memory meant he could recall intricate details of each route – invaluable to upcoming climbers – a skill he maintained until the end of his life. Tony attended Manchester University from 1949 to 1951 and graduated with a BSc in electrical engineering. Thereafter, his climbing focused on north Wales, where he developed new routes and techniques in the Carneddau and Glyder ranges. He made many first ascents, including Mur-y-Niwl on Craig yr Ysfa in 1952, and contributed significantly to British rock-climbing, publishing guidebooks to these areas and elsewhere. Joining the Climbers’ Club in 1947, Tony was president from 1969 to 1972 and variously custodian of two club huts: Cwm Glas Mawr and Helyg. In 1970 he was also president of the British Mountaineering Council, overseeing key negotiations with the Central Council of Physical Recreation. He accepted a position with ICI in July 1952. Before starting, he had been invited by the Everest Committee to join an expedition to climb Cho Oyu in early 1952 and a year later to attempt Everest, if “his efforts this year should show him worth including in the 1953 party”. Declining this invitation was perhaps his greatest regret. He wrote articles about his adventures, and these are being collated into a single publication. Tony married Pauline (nee Chapman), my mother, in 1956; they separated in 1984, and she died in 2020. In 1985 he met Annie Price, and they were in a partnership until her death in 2017. He is survived by me and my brother, Peter, and by Annie’s children, Janice and Russell.",News/World news,Tony Moulam obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/tony-moulam-obituary
1/26/2022,"The tuba is an instrument of some magnificence. Warm bellied and low-rumbling, it’s been the bedrock of orchestras for quite some time, but is perhaps not what you might think of as a centre-stage star. As part of lauded London group Sons of Kemet (and a collaborator with Moses Boyd and Nubya Garcia), Theon Cross is making it his mission to rehabilitate its image. At the overlap between R&B, hip-hop and jazz, his second album Intra-I adopts a cinematic approach to brass beat-making, vibrating with contemporary cool. On headphones, Intra-I invites main character syndrome: it’s like an imaginary soundtrack for an enthralling inner city crime drama. In a venue as intimate as this, it’s a different kind of arresting; the kind of intense communal experience that makes you wonder how it can happen so casually on an otherwise regular Tuesday night. In a world of samplers and loop pedals, it’s remarkable how little he relies on tape; whether establishing a beat, texture, or buzzing-bee melody, Cross’s pause for breath is so imperceptible that you suspect he must have gills to generate his astonishingly full sound.  Chat between songs is minimal (“we’re going to keep it more musical than verbal”), and from the crash-bang jungle-jazz of Activate to the disco marching band of 40tude, every moment laces itself neatly into the next, attitude lingering like the trail of a sparkler on a winter’s night. Far from a showboat, he builds space for each player to shine; drummer Patrick Boyle whacking his cymbal with meticulous chaos, guitarist Nikos Ziarkas laying down math-rock melodies with eyes tight shut, and Chelsea Carmichael demonstrating exactly why she is one of the country’s most exciting young saxophonists, matching Cross’s energy with ease and joy. In a multigenerational room of attendees, many are left agog, wondering if it’s too late into the New Year to take up a new hobby. If you have pondered the tuba, now might well be the time – this instrument just got seriously hip.",Arts/Music,Theon Cross review – more oomph than oompah from jazz-tuba champion,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/26/theon-cross-review-more-oomph-than-oompah-from-jazz-tuba-champion
1/26/2022,"Good morning. Joe Biden has said he will consider personal sanctions against Vladimir Putin if Russia invades Ukraine, as western leaders step up military preparations and make plans to shield Europe from Russian gas being cut off.  The rare sanctions threat came as Nato placed forces on standby and reinforced eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets in response to Russia’s troop buildup near its border with Ukraine. If Russia attacked, Biden said, it would be the largest invasion since the second world war and would “change the world”. The president said he would consider adding direct sanctions on Putin to a raft of measures being drawn up. “Yes. I would see that,” Biden said when asked by reporters in Washington about targeting Putin, whom opponents have long accused of holding gigantic secret wealth. Why are Germany and France at odds with the Anglosphere over how to handle Russia? The differences reflect not just different short-term assessments on intelligence, but a deep fissure going back decades about what Germany and France, as opposed to the Anglosphere, regard as the best way to handle Russia. The British prime minister is facing the most perilous time of his premiership, with exasperated Conservative MPs due to see an official report on allegations of Downing Street parties that have now triggered a criminal inquiry. The report could lead to a vote of no confidence in Johnson, and in turn to a Tory leadership election and potentially a new prime minister for the UK. Or Johnson may choose to simply resign, although it is said he intends to fight. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, announced yesterday that her officers were investigating allegations of law-breaking at the heart of government on the basis of evidence unearthed during the inquiry by the senior civil servant Sue Gray. Former No 10 staffers have told the Guardian that the police inquiry will uncover evidence that has not yet been submitted to Gray. One senior Tory said the Scotland Yard inquiry was a “different ballgame”, adding: “Officials who don’t tell Sue Gray the whole truth will not hold back from the cops.” What’s happening today? Johnson faces MPs in the weekly prime minister’s question time today. You can follow along here. Last week during the fixed session, some of his own MPs called for him to resign. Did Johnson have a birthday party in lockdown? Apparently so, although one Tory MP claimed it wasn’t a proper party and that Johnson was “ambushed with a cake”. Social media erupted with mockery at the MP’s remarks. The US Coast Guard has been searching for 39 people missing for several days after a boat believed to be used for human smuggling capsized off Florida’s coast en route from the Bahamas. A good Samaritan called the Coast Guard early on Tuesday after rescuing a man clinging to the boat 45 miles (72km) east of Fort Pierce, the maritime security agency reported on Twitter. The man said he had been with a group of 39 others that left the island of Bimini in the Bahamas on Saturday night. He said the boat had capsized in severe weather and that no one was wearing a lifejacket. The Coast Guard is calling it a case of human smuggling. The agency tweeted earlier yesterday about the search and then later posted a picture of the stranded man. What has the agency said? “Navigating the seas in overloaded & less than seaworthy vessels is extremely dangerous and can result in loss of life,” it said on Twitter. It has been searching by air and sea over a roughly 135-mile area extending from Bimini to the Fort Pierce Inlet. A SpaceX rocket is on a collision course with the moon after spending almost seven years hurtling through space, experts say. The booster was originally launched from Florida in February 2015 as part of an interplanetary mission to send a space weather satellite on a million-mile journey. Space observers believe the rocket – about four metric tonnes of “space junk” – is on course to intersect with the moon at a velocity of about 2.58km/s in a matter of weeks. Bill Gray, who writes software to track near-Earth objects, asteroids, minor planets, and comets, has said the Falcon 9’s upper stage will very likely hit the far side of the moon, near the equator, on 4 March. Has anything like this happened before? “This is the first unintentional case [of space junk hitting the moon] of which I am aware,” Bill Gray, who writes software to track near-Earth objects, asteroids, minor planets, and comets, said. Will the collision be visible from earth? Gray says it will probably go unobserved. “The bulk of the moon is in the way, and even if it were on the near side, the impact occurs a couple of days after new moon.” A documentary film about Alexei Navalny, who narrowly survived an apparent poisoning attempt with novichok, has premiered at the Sundance film festival. The 90-minute film, simply titled Navalny, was filmed during the several months he spent in Germany in late 2020 as he recovered from the poisoning. Seattle’s cement workers are striking over unfair labor practices, accusing their employers of refusing to negotiate in good faith. The striking workers fear employers want to purge unionized workers from the area’s construction industry and attempt to bankrupt the union through litigation. Cardi B has been awarded $4m in damages in a libel lawsuit against a celebrity gossip blogger who claimed that the rapper was a prostitute who used cocaine and had contracted sexually transmitted infections. Cardi B, born Belcalis Almánzar, sued the blogger known as Tasha K in 2019. Joe Manchin, a darling of the US coal industry, has attracted global anger over the climate crisis.

A monkey with ghostly white circles around its eyes is among 224 new species listed in the World Wildlife Fund’s latest update on the greater Mekong region. The conservation group’s report, released on Wednesday, highlights the need to protect the rich biodiversity and habitats in the region, which includes Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar. There are also dozens of newly identified reptiles, frogs and newts, fish and 155 plant species. The author of a new book The Power of Fun says having more fun builds resilience and will help get us through the next stage of the pandemic. Fun, Catherine Price argues, is not something that’s nice to have, but actually essential to a happy, healthy life – and it’s possible to have more of it, even during a pandemic. But can she get the Guardian writer Elle Hunt out of her funk? China, the world’s biggest source of climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, has been under pressure to “enhance ambition” and take more drastic action to tackle global warming. However, President Xi Jinping has said China’s ambitious low-carbon goals should not come at the expense of energy and food security or the “normal life” of ordinary people, signalling a more cautious approach to climate change as the economy slows. Clear winter skies and the promise of a recent evening’s beautiful sunset led the photographer Simone Engels to a nearby park on Vancouver Island. But as she trained her lens on the pinkish hue of the landscape of the Pacific coast, she was shocked to see a large, iceberg-like shape on the horizon. “It was this huge, shiny, three-dimensional tubular structure,” she said. “It looked so real.” She later learned that the mysterious iceberg was really a mirage.

1/26/2022,"The number of trafficking victims locked up in immigration detention centres has increased more than tenfold in the last four years according to data shared with the Guardian. The charity Focus on Labour Exploitation (Flex) obtained freedom of information data showing that in 2017 86 people – 14% of those suspected of being victims of trafficking – obtained what is known as positive reasonable grounds decisions after being locked up.  This decision indicates someone is a potential victim of modern slavery. By 2020 the number had jumped to 1,053 people – 86% of those suspected of being trafficking victims – obtaining positive reasonable grounds decisions. While part of the increase is likely to be because of better Home Office procedures for identifying trafficking victims, anti-trafficking campaigners say it is concerning that such a large number of these victims are not identified before a decision is made to lock them up. Organisations such as After Exploitation, Women for Refugee Women and Detention Action have documented cases where trafficking victims have been detained for several months and in one case for more than a year. Campaigners say the data is particularly concerning because the government has admitted new policies will lead to more trafficking victims being locked up. Under new rules, potential victims of trafficking who are placed in immigration detention are likely to have to provide medical evidence of future harm for officials to consider releasing them – the same rules that apply to others who are detained. Prior to the introduction of the new rules there was greater recognition of the vulnerability of this group. The newly established Immigration Enforcement Competent Authority has the power to decide whether or not someone is a victim of trafficking when they are detained and in some circumstances when they are not detained. Peter Wieltschnig of Flex said detention was an unacceptable environment for victims of trafficking that could have a severe impact on detainees’ physical and mental health. He warned that the new rules could jeopardise victims’ willingness to come forward and seek help if their immigration status was uncertain. “This data demonstrates that the government’s immigration-enforcement-centred approach is failing victims. It shows a systemic failure in providing opportunities to disclose trafficking or modern slavery so that victims can be identified and supported rather than detained,” said Wieltschnig. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The government is committed to tackling the heinous crime of modern slavery; ensuring that victims are provided with the support they need to begin rebuilding their lives and that those responsible are prosecuted. “Decisions to detain are made on a case-by-case basis and vulnerable people will only be detained when the evidence of vulnerability in their particular case is outweighed by the immigration considerations, such as risk of escape or for the protection of the public. “Staff in immigration removal centres undertake training on the national referral mechanism and as a result potential victims of modern slavery are regularly identified in detention.”",News/UK news,Huge rise in number of trafficking victims in UK immigration detention,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/26/huge-rise-number-trafficking-victims-uk-immigration-detention
1/26/2022,"Morrissey has accused his former Smiths bandmate Johnny Marr of using his name in interviews for “clickbait” and playing into the British press’s appetite for “cruel and savage” remarks about him. “If you can, would you please just leave me out of it?” he wrote in an open letter published on Morrissey Central.  “The fact is: you don’t know me,” Morrissey wrote. “You know nothing of my life, my intentions, my thoughts, my feelings. Yet you talk as if you were my personal psychiatrist with consistent and uninterrupted access to my instincts.” Marr responded to Morrissey’s open letter, writing on Twitter: “An ‘open letter’ hasn’t really been a thing since 1953, It’s all ‘social media’ now. Even Donald J Trump had that one down. Also, this fake news business…a bit 2021 yeah?” Marr is promoting a new solo album, Fever Dreams Pts 1-4. His offending remarks appear to come from the March 2022 issue of Uncut magazine, in which he mentions Morrissey in a discussion about collaboration. “It won’t come as any surprise when I say that I’m really close with everyone I’ve worked with – except for the obvious one,” he said. “And that isn’t that much of a surprise because we’re so different, me and Morrissey.” Marr is a left-wing, teetotal vegan who runs 10 miles a day. Morrissey has descended into infamy for his remarks on race and politics. After Stormzy headlined Glastonbury in 2019, Morrissey shared a video that accused the British establishment of using the rapper to promote multiculturalism at the expense of British culture, which Morrissey posted under the title: “Nothing but blue skies for Stormzy … the gallows for Morrissey.” He has frequently denied accusations of racism. He has referred to Hitler as “left wing”, praised Brexit, expressed support for the far-right political party For Britain, criticised sexual assault survivors and said that immigration diminishes British identity. In 2019, Liverpool’s Merseryrail transport network removed posters advertising his album California Son following a complaint from the member of the public regarding his views. In the open letter, Morrissey accused Marr of hypocrisy. “You found me inspirational enough to make music with me for six years. If I was, as you claim, such an eyesore monster, where exactly did this leave you? Kidnapped? Mute? Chained? Abducted by cross-eyed extraterrestrials? It was YOU who played guitar on Golden Lights – not me. “Yes, we all know that the British press will print anything you say about me as long as it’s cruel and savage. But you’ve done all that. Move on.” Morrissey pointed out that the pair haven’t been close for 35 years, “which is many lifetimes ago. When we met you and I were not successful. We both helped each other become whatever it is we are today. “Can you not just leave it at that? Must you persistently, year after year, decade after decade, blame me for everything … from the 2007 Solomon Islands tsunami to the dribble on your grandma’s chin?” He told Marr to move on and “take responsibility for your own actions and your own career, with which I wish you good health to enjoy”. “Just stop using my name as click-bait. I have not ever attacked your solo work or your solo life, and I have openly applauded your genius during the days of Louder Than Bombs and Strangeways, Here We Come, yet you have positioned yourself ever-ready as rent-a-quote whenever the press require an ugly slant on something I half-said during the last glacial period as the Colorado River began to carve out the Grand Canyon.” Marr is not exactly voluble on the matter of Morrissey, and generally approaches journalists’ and fans’ curiosity about their relationship – and evident differences of politics and personality – with a measure of diplomacy. In 2019, Marr told NME he wasn’t concerned about Morrissey’s controversial views affecting the legacy of the Smiths. “I don’t think you can change history … I’m not worried. It’s got nothing to do with my world or my life. The songs are out there for people to judge, relate to and hear. I think that’s all going to be forgotten in a few weeks, as these things inevitably are – for better or worse.” That same year, he told the Independent that he and Morrissey weren’t still friends and repeated the line – as he often does – about them being “very different … but everyone knows that! Everyone knows everything there is to know.” Fans have thrilled to any potential sign of a reconciliation between Morrissey and Marr, who met in 2008 to discuss the possibility of reforming – a discussion that Marr said ended abruptly, the topic never raised again. In 2019, Marr responded to a fan on Twitter who asked whether rumours about a Smiths reunion were true. Marr responded: “Nigel Farage on guitar.”",Arts/Music,‘You don’t know me’: Morrissey accuses Johnny Marr of using him for clickbait,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/26/morrissey-accuses-johnny-marr-clickbait
1/26/2022,"The final point said it all. An 11-shot rally that started with a Kaia Kanepi serve and finished with Iga Swiatek’s racket somewhere other than in her hand. Poland’s world No 9 had spent the intervening 19 seconds stretching, sliding and almost slipping, but still somehow conjuring answers to each question set by her aggressor up the other end. “Defensive” can mean all manner of things. An over-concern with self-justification. A means of driving a car safely. A negative way of playing football. In Swiatek’s case it was steely resolve, the bedrock of her three-hour passage to a second grand slam singles semi-final and first on a hard court.  The 2020 French Open winner was on the back foot throughout this finale of a point, just as she had been at many junctures over the course of three hours in 36C heat. Kanepi was sending down smash after smash and it was surely only a matter of time before one stuck. But when the Estonian landed a shot outside the tramlines, Swiatek’s pressure valve finally released, and with it went her racket, slung into the humid air inside Rod Laver Arena. An emotion-charged exclamation point on the longest match of her major career. “I wasn’t even thinking a lot, I was just running,” Swiatek said. “I was actually thinking: ‘Where is like the biggest probability where she can hit the smash?’ It’s luck that you’re going to go the right way. There is that probability, but you never know what your opponent is going to do.” Swiatek’s last two matches have been dogged examinations. Against Sorana Cîrstea in the fourth round on Monday she lost the first set and rallied to win in three. On Wednesday she repeated the feat against Kanepi, the unseeded world No 115 and, at the age of 36, the oldest quarter-finalist across both the men’s and women’s singles. In the previous round Kanepi dumped out second seed Aryna Sabalenka in arguably the upset of the tournament, but here she found herself in the presence of a 20-year-old who would not go lightly, who saved eight set points before eventually ceding the opening set and then utilised old-fashioned grit to hold on at key moments in the subsequent two before eventually prevailing 4-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3. Swiatek, who is now 5-0 in three-set matches at grand slams in which she lost the first set, returns to action on Thursday to face American Danielle Collins in the semi-finals. The American 27th seed shattered Alizé Cornet’s bid to make a first grand slam semi-final at the 60th time of asking, cruising to a 7-5, 6-1 win against the French player to continue her resurgence after surgery last year for endometriosis. “It feels incredible, especially after some of the health challenges that I have had,” Collins said. “To be able to get back to this level and be able to compete the way I have and be as physical as I have has been so rewarding. “I definitely feel more free [without pain]. I feel like I have solutions to be able to manage it when there are things that come up. I certainly feel a lot freer just not having to deal with the symptoms that I used to deal with, that not being a continuous issue that I’m dealing with on a daily basis.” Cornet was resilient regardless of the scoreboard, but simply left her run too late and was still feeling Monday’s marathon win over Simona Halep. “Emotionally it was a lot to handle, I’m not going to lie,” she said. “But I felt pretty ready for this match today. Physically I recovered well. Mentally I was ready for another fight. I think the way Danielle was playing just didn’t help me at all. I couldn’t get into the rhythm.

1/26/2022,"Isaw a man in skinny jeans and winklepickers the other day, and found myself transported back to a time when I cared about men’s shoes. “I used to go wild for men dressed like that,” I told my bemused husband, who is older than me, and so didn’t buy into the early 00s indie scene and has never worn a pair of drainpipes in his life. Later that day I discovered that indie – or rather, the early-millennium indie aesthetic – is back, as popularised by the nostalgic Instagram account @indiesleaze and the TikTok trend. This is being old, I guess. “Are you ready for the return of indie sleaze?” Vogue asks, and the answer is no, I am not, because it was what, five minutes ago? I suppose it comes for all of us eventually, that feeling, which my mother fondly remembers as being encapsulated by the day I appropriated her boots from the 90s, declaring them “vintage”. Friends ponder whether the internet has accelerated trend cycles and, while there is probably something in that, it’s also time for ageing millennials to accept that, like every generation, we will be forced to see our youth subcultures appropriated and sold back to teenagers. “They’re selling Nirvana T-shirts in H&M now,” I remarked a few years back, offering an unwittingly late-capitalist bastardisation of Withnail and I (“They’re selling hippy wigs in Woolworths, man”).  I was an indie girl, as the boys called us then, though I was never as much of a scenester as some of my friends. Yes, I drank at the Hawley Arms and the Good Mixer in Camden, went to Trash, saw the Strokes at a tiny secret gig. I wore the skinny jeans and the ballet pumps and the leather jacket, though I was always too Welsh to fully jettison the fake tan and eyelashes. On balance I preferred the way we dressed for the less pretentious nights out at indie clubs in Liverpool and Manchester: Converse-puncturing stilettos, prom dresses, big beehives scaffolded by rollers, but all with that slightly down-at-heel, sordid edge – smudged eyeliner, bra straps showing, big wet pouts – complemented by how our clothes smelled the next day of stale cigarette smoke, sweaty dancefloors, Chance by Chanel, and snakebite (God, snakebite!). Of course there was the music, that was the point of it, though it quickly became so heavily commercialised and marketed that it became known as “landfill indie”, the history of which was memorably narrated in a 2016 Vice article by Johnny Borrell, a man whose hubris rose to such heights that his quip that: “Dylan is making the chips, I’m drinking the champagne” went down in music interview history. (A Guardian review of Razorlight’s 2018 single Olympus Sleeping sniggered: “Hey Dylan, fire up the deep fat fryer, because Razorlight are back baby”.) It still makes me laugh, because that’s what much of that scene boiled down to, really: male egos. A part of me will always love the Libertines, but when they sang “And they all get them out … for the boys in the band”, they basically summed the whole thing up. Though there were some magnificent exceptions, especially on the more dancey, electro-y side of things – Karen O, Beth Ditto, Lovefoxxx, Peaches, Karin Dreijer – the early-00s indie scene was in large part about dirty-haired men with guitars, posturing and preening for the girls watching them. As a friend (not one of those pictured) who was “big in Camden” at the time fondly remembers: “My overriding memories involve starving myself to fit into the required uniform of denim cutoffs, getting ghosted by men a decade older than me in their skintight Topshop jeans … and putting so many drugs up my nose that I still have no feeling in my right nostril. “As a skinny, white, conventionally attractive girl I was welcomed into this hedonistic world where the boys in bands were king and sad girls their courtiers. The girls forgave all their bad behaviour – stealing our money for drugs, serial cheating, rampant misogyny – to avoid being called boring.” This was all pre-Me Too, remember, and we were very young. I liked the feeling of men being attracted to me, that locking of eyes across the dancefloor, the “meet me in the bathroom”-ness of it all, and to the men’s credit, they all danced. But I was less certain what to do with the feeling of being objectified by them, and the way women were photographed and perceived within the scene, as exemplified by Terry Richardson’s lo-fi, pornified aesthetic. By the time the music had descended to the nadir that was Kings of Leon’s Sex on Fire and, that same year, druggy footage of Pete Doherty, Amy Winehouse and some baby mice appeared on YouTube, indie had faded. It all started to feel hollow and sad, all court dates and tabloid headlines and ballet pumps filling with blood. Then Amy died and the party truly was over. So, while Gen Z are welcome to borrow from that time, they should bear in mind that there was always a bit of a dark side to it all (and should also be prepared, should they decide to play the Libertines’ Death on the Stairs, to be joined on the dancefloor by an onslaught of ageing millennial indie kids gesticulating wildly and mortifyingly). My mind boggles somewhat at the feminist strides that have been made even over the past decade when it comes to toxic male behaviour. Progress is a wonderful thing. Perhaps prioritise the style over the substances, is my advice. But what do I know? I’m an old lady now. An old lady who is about to clean up selling my old clobber on Depop.

1/26/2022,"A new analysis of popular brand name products detected toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” in nearly 75% of items labeled stain- or water-resistant. The study’s authors say the companies are needlessly putting customers’ health at risk. The findings highlight how the compounds are widely used in everyday products and clothing despite mounting evidence that the entire class of PFAS chemicals is associated with a range of serious health problems, and safer alternatives exist.  “When companies use PFAS to make products stain- or water-resistant, they are using chemicals that contaminate homes, drinking water, and breast milk with highly persistent chemicals,” said Erika Schreder, one of the study’s co-authors and science director of Toxic Free Future, a Seattle-based group that pressures brands to stop using the chemicals. PFAS are a class of about 9,000 compounds most often used to make products water-, stain- and heat-resistant, and are called “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally break down. They’re so effective that they’re used in thousands of applications across dozens of industries, but they’re also linked to cancer, decreased immunity, liver disease, kidney problems, birth defects and more. The study analyzed a total of 60 products – including jackets, hiking pants, shirts, mattress pads, comforters, tablecloths and napkins – from large retailers including Amazon, Bed Bath & Beyond, Costco, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Kohl’s, Macy’s, REI, Target, TJX and Walmart. PFAS were detected in 34 of 47 products that were labeled water- or stain-resistant, or a similar variation like “waterproof” or “water repellant”. Independent laboratories conducted the testing. Among brand names that were found to use PFAS were jackets made by Alpine Design and Patagonia, or in partnership with Gore-Tex and Teflon. Jackets produced by Mammut and the North Face did not contain PFAS, though some of their products do. The chemicals are applied as a surface treatment to create a barrier against stains and water, or are used to create a membrane that makes rain gear more “breathable”. As the barrier or membrane breaks down, the chemicals can end up in the air and inhaled, or on surfaces where they can be ingested. “When you have these products indoors, depending on how many PFAS treated products you have, there will be high levels of PFAS in your indoor air,” Schreder said. The chemicals also can also be absorbed through the skin and are a problem for workers in textile factories, where researchers have found high exposure rates, Schreder added. The study also found 13 products that were labeled water- or stain-resistant but did not contain PFAS, which Schreder said highlights that alternatives are available. Some products use materials like polyurethane or polyester to help products resist water, while others have had success with paraffin wax. Sometimes companies will use different chemicals that they will claim as trade secrets and aren’t required to disclose. Even among companies like outdoor brands Patagonia and REI, which tout their green credentials on their websites, PFAS are still commonly used. Brands that have resisted pressure to eliminate the chemicals from their products and supply chains often say they haven’t found alternatives that perform as well as PFAS, Schreder said. “On the other hand, you can find plenty of information about companies that use alternatives and they find that the performance is excellent,” she added. All products tested that were not labeled stain- or water-resistant were found to be PFAS-free. Most companies won’t say if they use PFAS, which they claim as a trade secret. Without accurate labeling, it’s nearly impossible for consumers to determine if a product contains PFAS, though they can call the company to inquire. But the study stresses that it shouldn’t be up to consumers to determine if their clothing or home products are toxic. “Retailers, manufacturers, and state and federal leaders each have a role to play to bring a swift end to this unnecessary use of PFAS,” the study states.",News/Environment,"Nearly 75% of water-resistant products contain toxic PFAS, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/26/water-resistant-products-toxic-pfas-study
1/26/2022,"In 1966, a colliery spoil tip above the Welsh village of Aberfan collapsed; 116 children and 28 adults were killed when the village was buried under a wave of slurry. Jo Browning Wroe’s debut novel, A Terrible Kindness, purports to be the story of a young embalmer who attends the disaster. The first thing to say is that it resolutely isn’t: it is, in fact, the kind of novel I used to enjoy reading off my grandparents’ shelves, a domestic saga about a young man struggling to overcome his childhood while joining the family business. Mentally scarred by Aberfan, William Lavery tries, unsuccessfully, to break up with his girlfriend Gloria, and tells her he will never want to have children. The story then spools back to his chorister childhood in Cambridge, his falling out with his best friend, Martin, when Martin more or less assaults him in his sleep, and his determination never to sing again after inviting his uncle, who is gay, and his uncle’s partner to hear him at a service. His mother makes a scene on discovering them there, and William ends up moving in with his uncles. While taking Gloria around Cambridge, William bumps into Martin again; he later embarks on a redemptive trip to Aberfan.  This is the story of a man who has been profoundly affected by the death of his father and who, as a result, acts with extreme selfishness towards everyone in his life. William is a difficult character to like, no matter how much trouble he’s put through by Browning Wroe, a writer with a promising instinct for handling the tectonic elision of narrative events, so the next setback is always appearing round the corner in her well-structured tale. The novel affords limited emotional access to him, often relating the bare facts of events without letting the reader in on their impact. There is also a good deal of clunky writing throughout. Sentences such as “the roast pork … moved from William’s plate, to his mouth, to his stomach easily”, or “Ray’s baby is nestled inside her warm body”, sound like faltering translations, while the description “Aberfan is black, white or grey” will seem cursory to anyone who has seen images of the landslide. There are other difficult elements. A fair chunk of the book is preoccupied with the homophobia of the period, which is well drawn, but presented without comment, so that for sustained periods the reader is simply wading through pages of anti-gay prejudice; a strangely dated experience. More troubling still is the use of Aberfan, which is presented as an instigating incident, but by the end of the novel has been acknowledged to be actually quite incidental. As Gloria tells William: “You’re scared of help because of what else it will uncover. This isn’t just about Aberfan.” Gloria is one of several characters whose dialogue often seems to sum up the book’s themes. William’s mother, Evelyn, helpfully informs him, “There’s a madness that comes with grief”, and Martin is similarly educational: “You shut [music] out as if it was the thing that hurt you, when all along, it’s been the thing that can save you.” When William finally returns to Aberfan, the focus is not on the disaster that happened there, but on how a bereaved mother was comforted by hearing him sing. Frankly, it feels a little tasteless – a tragedy bolted on to a conventional 1960s family saga, written and published half a century later. Has the passage of time made it acceptable to use the dead of Aberfan as a literary device that prompts a character to re-engage with the troubles of their childhood?

1/26/2022,"Rahsaan “New York” Thomas the acclaimed journalist who co-hosts the Ear Hustle podcast from inside San Quentin prison, was granted clemency this month, prompting celebrations from listeners and supporters across the country.  But it could be months – or years – before he walks free. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, granted Thomas a commutation for his sentence of 55 years to life, acknowledging the “work he has done … to transform himself”. In addition to co-producing and co-hosting the Pulitzer Prize-nominated show, Thomas, 51, writes for the San Quentin News, the Marshall Project and Current; chairs a Society of Professional Journalists chapter; mentors youth; co-founded a non-profit for incarcerated writers; and directed a Sundance documentary short. The commutation of his sentence for second-degree murder and related charges allows Thomas for the first time to go before the parole board, which will then decide whether he is “suitable” for release. But it could be months before his hearing date, and if he is denied parole, as the majority of incarcerated people are after their first board appearance, it would be more than a year before he gets another shot. The uncertainty is not stopping Thomas from mapping out ambitious plans for life after incarceration. The New York native recently spoke to the Guardian by phone about his 21 years behind bars, his career goals and what he’s learned about the system. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Congratulations on the news. What was your reaction when you got the call? I was happy, of course, and proud. It’s a great honor for the governor to recognize that you’re a different person today than you were 20 something years ago. And I was relieved. Until he commuted my sentence, I didn’t have a path to freedom. Freedom was something that was hypothetical, with changes in law that might happen one day. But now the clock starts for my freedom. Now I get to be scheduled for a parole board hearing. I don’t know if I’ll make the first one, but at least I’ll get to talk about it. And if I get denied, I’ll go a couple years later and try again, and I’ll keep trying until I get out. For a guy like me in prison with all of these [Covid] lockdowns, the sooner the better. It’s a race against the next Covid variant. How are you feeling about going before the parole board? I’m grateful for this opportunity that I didn’t have before, but I also recognize that it’s going to be hard. You have to talk about the worst thing you’ve ever done and all your trauma. I know a lot of great people that are out [of prison] now, but the board didn’t see their greatness their first hearing. You can go in there nervous and blow your answers. Even though I’m not confident that I’ll make it the first time, I believe I’ll make it the second time, and hopefully be home by 2025. And in the meantime, I’ll keep doing Ear Hustle, keep writing and keep getting better. I know the parole hearing is a long process, but I’d love to hear what your overall message will be to the board? I think the primary thing is that I’m a different person, and the person I am today is an asset to the community. The debt I owe, I could never pay. But I’m not paying it in prison. Prison was a place to put me to punish me. But now, it costs $106,000 a year [to incarcerate me] – that’s money taken away from schools and Covid relief. And I think I’m a person that can bring violence down on the outside. I’m a person that is making a difference in this world and I just want a chance to pay taxes and pay society back. I don’t know how far ahead you have thought, but what are your plans for your first few years out? I hope I come home in time for Ear Hustle to still be there, for me to get a job. I’m also part of a program called Squires where I mentor at-risk youth. I want to continue that on the outside and be on the frontlines. That’s my way of staying grounded in the work and what’s going on in the community, so I can try to come up with solutions. But the big thing I want to do is to write books. I’m writing stories that take on the challenges of [prison abolition organizer and writer] Mariame Kaba who wrote a book called We Do This ‘Til We Free Us: Abolitionist Organizing and Transforming Justice. She talks about how people can’t imagine what change looks like, because they have never seen it before. They can’t imagine a world without prisons, because there are people who did really harmful, harmful stuff and will do it again if let out. So how do we change that behavior? How do we stop these cycles of violence? That’s great – how have you been thinking about solutions? I’m writing books that imagine these solutions, and they’re real. They’re real to me, because I’m in San Quentin, a prison that was once notorious and very dangerous – and it turned into one of the nicest places I’ve ever been, where celebrities come hang out [with arts, education and other programs that bring people in from the outside]. I’ve seen the impact of therapy, and having a connection to the community, feeling like you’re part of this society, and not some outcast that can’t even vote, like a refugee in your own country, being connected to a society that cares about you and has support for you, and what that looks like, and how that helps and how that changes people. If we can do that in a prison, why can’t we do that in our neighborhoods? How can we change the conditions so you don’t have to get these services after you’re incarcerated, after somebody is harmed and you can’t repair that harm, ever. I want to tell those stories. It sounds like the community in San Quentin and your work with Ear Hustle have really changed you. It’s life changing. When I was 19, I went to prison for two years and made the decision to do right when I came home, and I did at first. But my trauma got triggered. I got stressed about poverty, injustices with my little brother, all this stuff and I relapsed and went back to my old ways. My old ways were never gone because I never dealt with my trauma and I never healed. In San Quentin, not only have I found a trade I love, but I met all these incredible people and community members. Growing up [in Brownsville in Brooklyn], I lived in a segregated neighborhood with all Black and Puerto Rican people and limited resources. I felt like nobody cared about me, like the world was unjust and the laws were designed for me to fail. I didn’t feel an obligation to society, because I felt like society didn’t care about me. I don’t feel like that anymore. I learned why my neighborhood was so messed up, that it’s bigger than just the people and the trauma. That it’s systemic, it’s what was done to us for generations. I was also trying to be a writer for 13 years and it didn’t start really poppin until I got to San Quentin. It’s the worst conditions, but it’s the best prison for opportunities. I want that opportunity to exist in Brownsville, in Oakland, in Los Angeles. I want it to be a before, not an after. What do you want the public to know about others behind bars like you who may not get the same opportunity to come home? I’m going to go home with a list of names of people that I feel have been ignored or forgotten about. I have a little campaign going now at FreeRahsaan.com, with t-shirts to raise money, and when I get home I want to keep the momentum going. There’s one guy I know who has done 30 years already because of the three strikes laws. It was a horrible crime, but the person he is today, I know it will never happen again. I also created this program called Empowerment Avenue [for incarcerated writers and artists] to help people develop the right careers in prison and come home to a society that is ready for them with open arms. I’m creating the opportunity that I had in San Quentin the best way I can for people in other prisons. So these people exist to the world, because their writing is out there, they are making these connections, these editors know them. And so if they’re trying to prove their case to a governor, they’ll have that kind of support that I have, because they are known and part of society, and are not behind a wall, hidden and invisible. There is a lot of public attention on your case – what message do you want to share to your supporters? I can never say I deserve freedom. I can just say it doesn’t make sense for me to be here anymore. People say I earned it and ‘good job’, and I just want people to know I can’t earn it. There’s nothing I can do to make up for what I did, it’s impossible. I can’t bring this person back. I don’t say his name, without the permission from the family, but I try to honor him by making amends. And I can at least pay society back in a better way, or do the best I can to pay an unpayable debt. And for other people who are incarcerated, I say just keep doing good. Don’t give in to hopelessness. I was sentenced to 55 to life – and there was no reason to be a good person when you have that sentence. I started at 29 years old. I was going to be 85 before I saw a parole board, and Black people just don’t live that long. I had to find hope in the next life. I got into religion, became a Muslim. And that faith, whether God exists or not, kept me good enough and on the right enough path to have this opportunity now. Just find a way to be productive and be of service. Do you feel hopeful about progress and changes to the system? I do, though I was kind of shocked to see the stories about the retail thefts and see the news blow things out of proportion. It’s not anything new, but the news kept it on repeat. Homicides are up – not to the level of the 80s and 90s, but they are up. So we’re in this moment where money is shifting from the police to the neighborhoods, but with homicides going up, is it going to shift back? Are people going to understand that it’s Covid and the trauma and poverty and the other underlying root causes, and that we’re not going to solve this with handcuffs, and that if we leave the root causes, the next individual will take up the same cycle? I’m hoping that people are smarter than that. And we keep pushing to put resources into the neighborhoods that solve the root causes. I know it’s a cliche question, but what food are you most looking forward to eating? Shrimp, steaks and asparagus. All the Italian food. What else are you most excited to do? Besides finding a wife, sex and food (laughs), it’s the simple things, like driving around in a car, and traveling. I’ve never left the country. I want to go to Japan and France and Amsterdam and England. I’ve got about one more minute to chat with you before the [guard cuts us off], but I want to have an opportunity to just be free, and take what I learned in prison and apply it to the world, and see how it works. I’m looking forward to that challenge.",News/US news,"Rahsaan Thomas, the Ear Hustle host, on clemency and life after prison: ‘I want to tell our stories’",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/26/ear-hustle-podcast-rahsaan-thomas-sentence-commuted-interview
1/26/2022,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has unveiled plans to conduct unannounced inspections of plants suspected of air pollution violations in the heavily industrialized region in Louisiana known as Cancer Alley and other locations around the US south. The move, announced on Wednesday morning alongside other significant new enforcement and monitoring actions, is aimed at reining in pollution in an area with much of America’s most toxic air.  The agency intends to expand air monitoring in a number of locations visited by the EPA administrator, Michael Regan, last November, and will work to develop new measuring techniques for the “emerging contaminants” chloroprene and ethylene oxide. Both pollutants are likely or known human carcinogens that are emitted at dangerous levels in locations around the region, notably in St John the Baptist parish. Regan unveiled a new air monitoring program in the parish, which is the location of the Guardian’s extended Cancer Town series, around the fence line of a synthetic rubber plant operated by the Japanese chemicals firm Denka. The site is the only location in America to emit chloroprene and does so at levels regularly above the EPA’s lifetime exposure guidance of 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter. In a letter addressed to the CEO of Denka and the plant’s former operator, the chemical giant DuPont, which was shared with the Guardian, Regan expressed significant concern about the effects of chloroprene emissions on children at a nearby elementary school, which sits close to the Denka fence line. “As a parent I remain extremely concerned about the more than 500 children at the elementary school. I am writing to you today to reiterate what I hope are our shared concerns and expectations regarding the health and wellbeing of the students,” Regan writes. “The EPA expects DuPont and Denka to take other needed action to address community concerns.” In a press release, the administrator also announced his enforcement and compliance office would work with the US Department of Justice to seek “additional and timely avenues of relief” for residents around the plant. The EPA did not provide further details. A spokesperson for Denka said the company had just received the letter and would review it. “That said, we look forward to a continued dialogue with Administrator Regan and the EPA,” the spokesperson said, adding that the company had been “working with the community for some time and will continue to do so”. In neighboring St James parish, Regan said his department would provide technical assistance to the US army corps of engineers in an ongoing re-evaluation of a proposed plastics facility operated by the Taiwanese company Formosa, in effect placed on hold by the Biden administration last August amid widespread community concern. The gargantuan facility had been permitted to emit 13m tonnes of greenhouse gasses a year, the equivalent of three coal-fired power plants, along with 15,400lb of ethylene oxide. In the same parish, the administrator announced enforcement action against a steel plant, run by the industrial giant Nucor, which last year was revealed to have been quietly emitting cancer-causing sulphuric acid mist and hydrogen sulphide for six years without a permit. In unveiling a new plan of unannounced inspections in the region, Regan told reporters: “We want to keep these facilities on their toes so that they’re doing their due diligence all the time, not just when there’s a planned EPA inspection.” He added: “When facilities are found to be non-compliant, we will use all available to to hold them accountable.” The EPA also announced a $600,000 investment in mobile air pollution monitoring equipment to be used throughout the Cancer Alley region, in the town of Mossville, Louisiana and other locations around the south. In the neighborhood of Gordon Plaza, in New Orleans, a cancer hotspot built on top of a toxic waste site in the 1980s, Regan announced he would expedite a federal review of the site, which would commence in March this year.",News/US news,US to hold surprise plant inspections targeting pollution in Louisiana’s Cancer Alley,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/26/cancer-alley-epa-plant-inspections-pollution

1/26/2022,"It might not be your breakfast-table topic of choice, but we need to talk about cricket equipment. During the lockdown summer of 2020, Prof Martin Charter, from the Centre for Sustainable Design (CfSD) in Surrey, and the British Association for Sustainable Sport (BASIS) pulled stakeholders together to discuss the issues surrounding the manufacture of cricket gear. They weren’t quite sure what they would find. Following Tuesday’s hand-over-eyes showing at the DCMS committee hearing, it won’t perhaps come as much of a surprise to learn that one of the biggest issues they encountered in the game was a lack of transparency.  “Although there has been quite a lot of work done on sustainability and cricket at the macro level, for example on cricket stadia,” says Charter, “that is very different when you come to manufacturing. There is very little research in the public domain, especially when you consider that we are talking about the second-biggest sport on the planet. We know very little of the supply chain. There is a lot of outsourcing to Asia, for example, with details unknown.” The final report on Sustainability, Cricket Gear, Clothing and Apparel, published last week, reveals a dearth of information from manufacturers on topics ranging from employment rights and child labour to working conditions. As Charter points out, football started addressing a number of these issues in the 1990s (though stories of outrageous practice still crop up) – with the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WSGFI) working alongside Fifa to try to ensure that its licensed products are made in compliance with the WFSGI code of conduct. There appears to be no such scheme in cricket. There is also a lack of knowledge about the environmental footprint of the industry. There are big questions about water pollution, carbon emissions, micro-plastics and waste – but not many answers to be found. This lack of accountability does not, Charter stresses, mean that there are necessarily major problems. It does, however, mean that that no one buying in anticipation for the new season has much idea of how their new gear is being processed. Good practice is certainly not being shouted from the rooftops, with sustainability information not generally shared on cricket gear suppliers’ websites. And what happens to kit at the end of its life? Are there vast bundles of shirts, trousers, jumpers and pads stored in cupboards or garages or has it all been packed up, shoved on a boat and exported to landfill abroad? The answer, again, is that we simply don’t know. It feels like there is a huge potential for kit to be re-used in cricket, where interest often wanes after a season or as children move from softball to hard-ball cricket, and as kit is outgrown from summer to summer. This would both help the game become more accessible to those on a lower income – something highlighted recently with stories of families being charged fees running into hundreds of pounds to access county pathways – and feed into the circular economy. This might be something as simple as trousers being passed on, to the more complicated process of helmet grills being reused, or cricket nets repurposed. Professionals are often shining examples of this, mending and reusing their favourite bats until they fall to pieces. Charter hopes that cricket can plug into to the sort of work pioneered by Play it Again Sport, a small Welsh social enterprise that tries to ensure that all sports equipment gets reused and nothing goes to landfill. Cricket doesn’t always help itself. There was a test case in 2019 when Gray-Nicholls produced an up-cycled pair of batting gloves made from production waste – and cricket’s man of the moment, Sam Billings, wore them for a couple of warmup matches. The ICC then banned him from wearing them for the white-ball series against New Zealand because they contravened a pedantic rule on colour. With a dearth of available data to work with, the CfSD did some exploratory research on the environmental impact of five pieces of cricket equipment. The results led it to believe that it would be worth manufacturers investing in a vegan leather for cricket balls, something that the former Australia cricketer Jason Gillespie, a prominent vegan, has already called for. It also suggests investigation into possible alternatives to willow, with studies into the viability of bamboo cricket bats already under way by researchers at Cambridge University. Also tucked inside the report is a fascinating paragraph on the manufacture of bats and balls in the UK: sadly, the industry is on its knees. The Heritage Craft Foundation’s May 2021 Red List of Endangered Crafts records the manufacture of hand-stitched cricket balls in the UK as extinct. The UK’s cricket bat manufacturing industry is nearly as sickly, classed as an “endangered species.” With many of the practitioners heading towards retirement age, there may well be an opportunity here for the ECB, or even the PCA, to sponsor apprenticeships. With the help of BASIS, the CfSD has set up the PASIC website as a forum for information and to stimulate discussion around the sustainability of cricket equipment and clothing. Future projects plan to focus more closely on the circular economy and cricket clothing. During the process of compiling the report, Charter spoke to a number of past and present players, including the former South African opener Darryl Cullinan. He believes that there is a real interest in making the industry more sustainable, but that it will need both quality research to assess the environmental and social awareness in the sector and action from the game’s governing bodies.

1/26/2022,"Along a paved road that climbs the hillside to Celaque Mountain national park in south-western Honduras, one-room shacks are overshadowed by high-walled mansions – including the homes of President Juan Orlando Hernández and his political allies. Local people say the results of Hernández’s eight years as president are on full display.  “He worked hard for his own good – not for the good of the people,” said Jesús Martínez, 68, a farmer resting in the picturesque colonial park in the center of Gracias. “The people continue in calamity, and he’s leaving as a millionaire.” On Thursday, Honduras will inaugurate Hernández’s successor: the country’s first female president, Xiomara Castro. Her resounding victory in November’s general election was propelled by a wave of anti-Hernández sentiment that reached even into his home town of Gracias. “The results of the election are an expression of the overwhelming rejection of Juan Orlando and what he represented,” said Gustavo Irías, director of the Honduran watchdog group Cespad. Hernández is widely expected to be indicted by US prosecutors on drug trafficking conspiracy charges upon leaving office. It would mark a spectacular fall from grace for a president who was once considered one of Washington’s top allies in the region. The son of a prominent landholder who fathered at least 17 children, Hernández, 53, began his decades-long political career here in Gracias. He was raised in relative comfort compared with his rural counterparts – but far below that enjoyed by the urban elite. “[His father] had his properties, his cattle and a vehicle – and in those times a person who had a vehicle was wealthy,” said Ana Guillermina, a local historian and retired teacher who once counted Hernández among her primary school students. “I don’t recall that there was anything special about him.” When Hernández joined congress in 1998, fellow legislators from the time described him as quiet, humble, with few friends but with a keen interest on capitalizing upon his office. Hernández rose steadily up the political ladder, becoming president of Congress in 2010 and then president of the republic four years later. At the time, Honduras had one of the world’s highest homicide rates and was plagued by violent gangs and drug traffickers. To combat the crime wave, he deployed the military in the streets, filled the country’s prisons and started extraditing high-level drug traffickers to the United States. He was commended for his administration’s efforts by numerous US agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration. But at the same time, drug trafficking allegations mounted against one of his brothers, former legislator Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández, who was linked to a drug lab in 2014 and later to a helicopter that had transported cocaine, among other accusations. In 2016, Hernández announced that he would seek re-election despite a constitutional prohibition against it. That decision would ultimately turn many Hondurans against him, and the subsequent 2017 election was marred by allegations of fraud and violent repression of protesters by state security forces. “It would have been best for him to step aside because he was re-elected in a very unclear way,” said high school teacher Wilmer Oliva, as he sat in the shade of Gracias’s central park in December. Oliva voted for Hernández twice, but quickly regretted the second time. “These last four years have definitely been lousy. So many corruption and drug trafficking scandals.” In November 2018, less than a year into Hernández’s second term, Tony was arrested while visiting Miami and charged with drug trafficking and related weapons charges. A year later, a New York jury found him guilty on all counts following a trial that gripped the nation and exposed the depths of the government’s complicity in drug trafficking. Prosecutors named Hernández as an unindicted co-conspirator in the case against his brother and accused him of receiving millions in bribes from drug traffickers in what they described as “state-sponsored drug trafficking”. Hernández was then named by US prosecutors as a co-conspirator in two additional drug trafficking cases, including one in which he allegedly plotted with a drug trafficker to “shove the drugs right up the noses of the gringos”, Hernández has denied all allegations related to drug trafficking, calling them lies made up by violent criminals who are seeking to reduce their sentences. He did not respond to an interview request. The Trump administration turned a blind eye to the accusations while Hernández continued to bend to the will of its migration agenda. But the Biden administration, which has pledged to fight corruption as part of its plan to address the root causes of migration, has essentially shunned the outgoing president, preferring to wait out his term with the hope of a fresh start with the new administration. Meanwhile, the drug trafficking accusations piled on top of numerous corruption scandals, in which Hernández has also denied involvement. A bungled response to the Covid-19 pandemic and a devastating pair of major hurricanes in November 2020 made matters worse. Poverty rose to its highest level in four decades. Perhaps it was unsurprising then, that when the country went to the polls in November, Hernández’s party suffered unprecedented losses across the country, even losing control of city hall in Gracias, one of the party’s historic strongholds. “The king is dead, long live the king,” said the outgoing mayor of Gracias, Dr Javier Enamorado. With his party set to lose control of government and his power in Honduras withering away, Hernández has been forced to look abroad for allies – and potentially a place where he could avoid arrest and extradition to the United States. Until now, he has been protected from indictment by a Department of Justice policy of not presenting charges against sitting heads of state. On 10 January, he attended the inauguration of Nicaragua’s leader, Daniel Ortega, who was re-elected for a third time after an election broadly denounced as a charade. “He showed up as a defeated emperor without his great entourage,” said Irías, who noted that Nicaragua is already providing refuge to two former presidents of El Salvador who face corruption charges at home. “His intention was clearly to support one of the most authoritarian regimes of the region in exchange for an eventual refuge.”",News/World news,Honduran president’s fall from grace poised to end in US indictment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/honduras-juan-orlando-hernandez-president
