3/7/2022,"MEDYKA, Poland (Reuters) - Ukraine is not willing to compromise on its territorial integrity in talks with Russia but is open to discussing ""non- NATO models"" for its future, in a wider forum, one of its negotiators told Fox News. Ukraine has pursued membership of the European Union and NATO, both opposed by Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has cited Ukraine's potential membership of NATO as evidence of what he portrays as NATO aggression toward Russia. ""The response that we are getting from the NATO countries is that they are not ready to even discuss having us in NATO, not for the next period of five or 10 years,"" negotiator David Arakhamia said in remarks published on the Fox News website late on Saturday. ""We are ready to discuss some non-NATO models. For example, there could be direct guarantees by different countries like the U.S., China, UK, maybe Germany and France. We are open to discussing such things in a broader circle, not only in bilateral discussions with Russia but also with other partners."" Delegations from Ukraine and Russia have had two rounds of talks since Russia launched an invasion of its neighbour on Feb. 24. On Thursday, the sides agreed to open humanitarian corridors to allow civilians out of some combat zones, although there have been delays in implementing them. The next round of talks is due on Monday, according to the Ukrainian side.

 Kurt Volker, former U.S. envoy to Ukraine, said on Sunday that the Russian invasion will not end through negotiations, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""bent"" on destroying the country. ""Face the Nation"" host Margaret Brennan asked Volker on CBS if he could see any countries being able to negotiate an end to Russia's attack on Ukraine. ""Not at all. No, we have to understand that Putin is bent on a military victory. He wants to destroy Ukraine, decapitate the leadership. He doesn't care about how many casualties this causes, what happens to the civilian population. This is a messianic mission that he is on. This is why he has to be stopped,"" said Volker. Volker also called for the U.S. to provide A-10 aircraft to Ukraine, noting that Ukrainian pilots are trained to use the jets. Brennan noted that numerous other nations including France, Germany and Israel have attempted to diplomatically stop the war, and asked Volker who would be able to bring about an end. ""Ukrainian people can do this,"" Volker said. ""Ukrainian people are there, they are determined, they are fighting. We are fortunate that we don't have to be in a position of fighting Putin or trying to stop him. The Ukrainian people are ready to do this. And that's why it's critical that we give them every bit of support and assistance we can.""",World/The Hill,Volker says Russian invasion won't end with negotiations,https://news.yahoo.com/volker-says-russian-invasion-wont-165428756.html
