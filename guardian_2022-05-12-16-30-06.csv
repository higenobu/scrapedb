5/12/2022,"At an age where many of his contemporaries are winding down, the man they call the Grey Kenyan is somehow speeding up. On Sunday Jo Schoonbroodt, a 71-year-old from Maastricht, ran a marathon in a staggering 2hr 54min 19sec to become the fastest septuagenarian in history. A few days later, when the Guardian catches up with him, his achievement is still sinking in. “I only started jogging at 36 because my doctor told me I had high cholesterol,” he says, chuckling. “But last year I ran 7,242 kilometres [4,450 miles], which is more than double what I did in my car.” It also turns out that Schoonbroodt’s new 70+ world record, set at the Maasmarathon of Visé in Belgium, was inspired partly by an unlikely source: the Dutch crooner Eddy Wally. With a few miles remaining, he knew he was just ahead of the previous best, set by Gene Dyckes in 2018, because a friend was following him on his bike and barking out his lap times. But his legs were starting to get heavier. “However, my friend had a special trick to keep me on track,” says Schoonbroodt, who was wearing a yellow and blue kit in support of Ukraine. “He picked up his phone and put Eddy Wally’s song Chérie, Chérie on repeat. I’ve always loved it, I don’t know why. It gave me a boost in morale. I overtook one runner after another and, despite getting cramp in the final 500m, I was able to break the record by four seconds.” Incredibly it was Schoonbroodt’s 75th sub-three-hour marathon, and it came only four weeks after his 74th at the Rotterdam marathon. For good measure, the flying Dutchman also holds a number of ultra running records. He is clearly no ordinary Jo. But the secrets of his success might surprise you. “Most runners train too hard. I do a lot of my training with groups who run very slowly. And then I build on these basics with some faster interval training. But I don’t do the same stupid distance 10 or 20 times – I prefer to have a lot of fun with my running.” Schoonbroodt often runs at nine- or 10-minute mile pace, far slower than the 6:38min miles he ran for 26.2 miles to set his world record, but he says the crucial thing is he listens to his body. “A lot of people follow a training plan or coach and push on even when their body is saying: ‘No, this is not a good day to do it.’ But if you go out the door and just do what you feel, it’s easier to keep running and stay injury-free.” He also dismisses the idea that runners need to do anything special with their diets. “Diet? No, no,” he scoffs. “No diet! I eat double portions, of course, with all these calories I burn. I love pasta and potatoes. But whatever is on the table, I eat it.” He has a similarly relaxed attitude when it comes to alcohol. “I prefer the French wine and the Belgian beer. Not too much, and mostly on weekends. Wine is just a grape drink, so it’s made from nature. And Belgian beer is special. And if you do all this with your body,” he adds, referring to the 85 miles he still runs each week, “you need to give it something back. And this is what I give back to the body!” Schoonbrot is a former IT worker and can tell the exact day he started running – 1 January 1986 – and how many kilometres – 120,000 – he has done since. But he stresses he was no natural. At first people called him Jogger Jo, because he was slow. Nowadays he gets called the Grey Kenyan – a nickname given to him years ago by a race announcer as he blasted past athletes a third of his age. Being a late bloomer, he believes, has actually helped him because his ego never had to worry about chasing faster times of his youth. “Because I started so late, I missed my best years. But that’s no problem. Everything is still new to me.” Schoonbroodt also cites the new range of carbon-plated “super shoes”, which have swept the running world over the past five years, as a key factor. On Sunday he ran in the Asics Metapeed Sky, and is now a social media ambassador for the Japanese company, preaching the positive benefits of exercise to sceptics and lapsed practitioners. But while Schoonbrodt’s achievements are exceptional, he is not the only old master to defy conventional wisdom. Several men older than 70 have run a sub-three-hour marathon – the first of whom, Ed Whitlock, who died in 2017, also ran a 3:15 marathon after turning 80. So what might explain this phenomenon? John Brewer, a sports scientist at the University of the West of Scotland, points out that while we experience a 10% decline in muscle mass every decade as we age, the decline isn’t as sharp for endurance. “The scientific evidence shows that you can maintain your aerobic capacity – your Vo2 max – very effectively into old age,” he says. “And if you look at where we are now compared to 40 years ago, the advances in nutrition, sports science, recovery and technology, all mean that it is more feasible for people in their 60s and 70s to produce good performance if they follow the right training.” Brewer, who was also part of England’s backroom staff for the 1990 World Cup, says Schoonbrodt’s story carries another message – that it is never too late. “People think they can’t turn it around after years of no exercise or poor diets,” he says. “Well, actually you can.” Schoonbroodt, meanwhile, has no plans to put his feet up. “My next marathon is in two and a half weeks, on an old Roman road built 2,000 years ago,” he says, the excitement obvious. It will be his fifth in 2022. And with that he is off. After all, the quest for a 76th sub-three-hour marathon waits for no man. Not even one who is 71.",Sport/Sport,Age no barrier: how Jo Schoonbroodt smashed the 70+ marathon record,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/12/age-no-barrier-how-jo-schoonbroodt-smashed-the-70-marathon-record
5/12/2022,"The best, most compelling cricket going on anywhere last weekend wasn’t being played in London or Mumbai, but Hove, where Sussex were taking on Middlesex in the Second Division of the County Championship. There, one of the world’s best young fast bowlers, Shaheen Shah Afridi, was squaring off against one of its best old Test batsmen, Cheteshwar Pujara. The match was in the balance, Sussex were 40 runs ahead and had eight wickets left in their second innings and the two fought over it through that day and into the next. It felt like Championship cricket the way old salts tell you it always used to be back in their playing days. These are good weeks for county cricket, a reminder of the Championship’s strengths at a time when it is being blamed for so many of the English game’s failings, and a rejoinder to those who insist that the competition needs to be entirely reinvented. Sussex did well to sign Pujara while he has a point to prove to the Indian selectors who dropped him from their Test squad. He has scored four centuries in back-to-back matches now, and is racing against Pakistan’s opener Shan Masood, among others, to try to become the first batsman to score 1,000 first-class runs by the end of May since Graeme Hick did it in 1988. It’s a great story, but it is running alongside the Indian Premier League, which, as Graham Gooch once put it, is a bit like a fart competing with thunder. Some of the reports make Pujara sound like a man who has gone off to prove himself by serving on some wild and distant northern border of the sport. He’s not the only one out there. Pujara made a good chunk of his runs in partnership with his new teammate Mohammad Rizwan, who has just been named Wisden’s Twenty20 player of the year. The world’s leading Test batsman, Marnus Labuschagne, is at Glamorgan. His sometime teammates Marcus Harris and Matt Renshaw are trying to force their way back into the Australia side through their performances for Gloucestershire and Somerset respectively. And along with Afridi, Hasan Ali, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Abbas, Mohammad Amir and, until he was injured, Naseem Shah, are all out there terrorising batters. Pakistani quicks have replaced South African all-rounders as the season’s must-have accessory. The common denominator, of course, is that they are all players who did not make it to the IPL. Labuschagne, like Pujara, went unsold in the auction, while the Pakistanis are still shut out of it. But there’s a glimpse here of where the Championship fits into the sport, as a red-ball tournament partly run in parallel with the IPL. And right now, if first-class cricket is your thing, it’s where your attention is drawn too. Especially if you’re English. The overseas players may not have had a choice, but some of the homegrown ones did. Ben Stokes laid down a marker when he decided not to enter the IPL auction because he wanted to make Test cricket his priority. It was interesting to hear that he told Saqib Mahmood that he ought to do the same. The other reason why these early weeks of the Championship have been so interesting is that there are so many English players with something to prove, whether they’re older ones such as Dom Sibley and Rory Burns, who are trying to show they deserve another shot at Test cricket. Or younger ones such as Harry Brook and Tom Haines, making the case that they should get it instead. If you’re English and want to get ahead in Test cricket this season, you need to be playing in the Championship. Which invites the question whether that should go for coaches too. All the talk is that England may need to give one, or both, of the two head coaching roles to men who will want to double it up with their current jobs in the IPL. Brendon McCullum, who is apparently now the favourite for the Test job, has been working as the head coach of the Kolkata Knight Riders (although it’s interesting to see that there are reports that he may have fallen out with either, or both, of the captain and chief executive, so who knows how that will go), and another of the favourites, Gary Kirsten, is with the Gujarat Titans. England’s director of cricket, Rob Key, says it’s better to have the right man for 10 months of the year than the wrong one for 12. Better yet, of course, to get the right man all year round. Or is that really not an option? There’s a lot to like about McCullum, and the idea that he might oversee the sort of revival that he led in New Zealand when he was captain there. But unless he’s going to give up the IPL he needs to persuade English cricket that he will bring so much to the job that it would compensate for the fact that he would be away working in another country, in another format, for a significant stretch of the first-class season. Which is a hard case to make. Because as soon as the team loses the job share will become a problem for him and the England and Wales Cricket Board, in the same way that England’s rugby union head coach Eddie Jones’s (much smaller) consultancy role at Suntory Sungoliath has for English rugby. And understandably so. It would be different in white-ball cricket, where the two jobs might at least be complementary, but right now, it really feels like English Test cricket needs undivided attention.",Sport/Sport,IPL rejects and England hopefuls breathe new life into County Championship | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/12/ipl-rejects-and-england-cricket-hopefuls-breathe-new-life-into-county-championship
5/12/2022,"You had only to watch a few minutes of the state opening of parliament to know that, in Britain, an old order is passing. Most comment has focused, naturally enough, on the enforced absence of the Queen, and on Prince Charles deputising for her. But the process of change we are witnessing is not just about individuals, it’s about our governance too. It’s about our politics – and it’s even about the nation itself. The rituals and robes of a state opening appear familiar. But they are an invented tradition from the imperial age, like the building in which they take place. What we saw on Tuesday dates from 1852, during the reign of Queen Victoria, who only intermittently opened parliament herself. Most of the current uniformed flummery was created for Edward VII in 1902. It is important to understand this, because it is a reminder that things do not always have to be this way. It can be tempting to slip into the trap of thinking that Britain’s institutions constitute a settled order. In fact, they are always being changed. If they are not, they find themselves at risk. That is a point that Britain has reached many times in the past, including 1689, 1707, 1832 and 1918, and which it has reached once again in the 2020s. In the monarchy’s case, it is often said that Prince Charles gets this. He is depicted as favouring a slimmed down monarchy. But it is not clear how far he is prepared to go in other respects. Does he intend, as king, to open parliament in full dress admiral’s costume, as he did on Tuesday? Does he still hope to be an activist monarch, as he sees it, or an interfering one, as critics are likely to do? Is he prepared for Commonwealth countries to replace him as head of state? These things will recast Britain’s views of the monarchy too. But these questions are also part of a larger evolution in the way Britain sees itself. Last week’s local elections were understandably seen as a test for Boris Johnson. By that entirely valid yardstick, his Conservatives not only took a pasting but caught a vivid glimpse of worse electoral pastings likely soon to come. Yet the government programme read out this week does little to change that. It reflects a party that cannot agree what it stands for, does not know where its priorities lie and thus has no answer to the increasingly pressing questions about this country’s identity and the way that should be reflected in its institutions. As a result, the UK seems merely to be testing itself, if not to destruction, then certainly to something close to dissolution. This is happening on a daily basis in Scotland, where the SNP tries endlessly to manoeuvre itself into a referendum winning position, and sometimes in Wales too. But it is especially sharply evident in Northern Ireland, where the idea of the United Kingdom has always faced its most severe challenges over the past century. Sinn Féin’s success last Thursday in the Northern Ireland assembly elections was more than a symbolic victory. It was a real one, in political and demographic terms. It is not likely to lead any time soon to one Ireland. But it has reset the old balances. Today, unionism feels, looks and, above all, is in a new and weaker place in Northern Ireland. It needs to take stock and rethink. Yet at just this delicate moment, the Johnson government appears determined to unleash a wheel of fire rolling through Irish and European politics. By ripping up its own Brexit agreement with the EU, the UK does not just antagonise most Irish opinion, the White House and the EU – none of which are great moves during a European war – it also tears up a bit more of its own credibility as a trustworthy signatory of all international trade deals, treaties and conventions. In addition, it throws a phoney lifeline to the most uncompromising strains of unionism just when the DUP’s strategic failure has been dramatically exposed at the ballot box. Instead of using its influence to influence the DUP “to attract rather than antagonise”, as the former Ulster Unionist party official Alex Kane urged this week, the Johnson government is instead giving the DUP a free pass to adopt an intransigent and absolutist stance. The approach will not work on any level, not even in rallying support in the Tory party. It certainly will not win fresh support in Ireland, north or south, except within the DUP. Fintan O’Toole this week called it “a mutually fatal death grip”. Down the line, it is also likely to strengthen support for Scotland to break away from the union. One-nation Conservatism has never seemed more remote than it does today. However, the same is also true of other shared ideas of Britain. We still call ourselves the United Kingdom. But the local elections again exposed a nation state whose union is weakening, whose rival visions are sharper than ever and whose kingdom is even uncertain. David Miliband put it well in a speech last weekend, when he said that a modern idea of Britain remains trapped between “the obsolete and the utopian”. This is a country, Miliband argued, that is badly in need of a new national project of reform. That case will only strengthen as the pressures on the union and the constitution mount up. Yet we are still led, to our shared loss, by a prime minister whose only project is himself.

5/12/2022,"Ukrainian families could potentially be housed with a host who has failed a DBS check, a council has warned, as the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme continues to face a range of problems. A DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check allows employers or other bodies to check the criminal record of someone applying for a role. William Benson, chief executive of Tunbridge Wells borough council, said that if a host failed a DBS check, or their home was deemed unsuitable for the scheme, they would not necessarily be prevented from hosting a Ukrainian refugee as these two processes “run parallel to each other”. He added that refugees were matched to hosts before the DBS check process began. Benson said: “One of the big outstanding issues is that we do not yet know what we do if a host fails a DBS, or a house check. So under what power do we remove someone who has had a pretty traumatic experience coming over here? “There is a potential that a guest is on their way, or has arrived, to be hosted in a house that we don’t believe is suitable.” After a Ukrainian refugee is matched with a host, Kent county council performs the DBS check and Tunbridge Wells borough council performs the check to see whether the house is suitable. But, according to Benson, because they are “separate processes, it is entirely possible that the guests could have had their visa approved and have arrived in a home that we don’t believe is suitable”. Benson has called for more guidance from central government on what to do in such potential cases. Kent county council has also expressed concern regarding the lack of provision made for people coming to the UK through the Ukraine family scheme, which allows applicants to join immediate family members based in the UK, rather than through Homes for Ukraine. “We still retain concern about the operation of the family scheme,” said Roger Gough, the leader of Kent county council. “On one side, regarding the Homes for Ukraine scheme, there is clarity of how it should work, and there is government funding. On the side of those coming via the family route, there is nothing. “And equally, it is also not clear what happens if those relationships break down and people come into the system needing rematching.” According to Gough, there have been instances of family breakdowns and of Ukrainians coming to the UK through the families scheme and later presenting to the council as homeless. In one particular case, a person who occupied a room in a shared house signed up to host four people under the family scheme, who then had to be rehoused due to the unsuitability of the accommodation. Kent has seen about 7,000 households register interest in becoming a host under the Homes for Ukraine scheme and, of these, 1,104 have been matched with Ukrainian refugees so far. The Homes for Ukraine scheme has faced many problems since its launch. Most recently the government had to rehouse hundreds of Ukrainians granted visas because the people they were supposed to stay with had been deemed “unsuitable”. A government spokesperson said: “More than 37,400 people have arrived through both Ukraine schemes and the vast majority of these are settling in well. Very few sponsorships are breaking down. Where they do, councils are able to provide support or find a more suitable sponsor.”",News/UK news,"Ukrainian refugee families could get host who failed DBS check, says council",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/11/ukrainian-refugee-families-could-get-host-who-failed-dbs-check-says-council

5/12/2022,"Britain’s economy contracted in March as consumers cut back on spending in the face of the rising cost of living, the latest official figures show. Activity fell by 0.1% after flatlining in February – an even weaker performance than economic experts had been predicting – with spending in shops suffering particularly badly. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed the economy struggling even before households were hit by higher energy bills and tax increases in April and will increase pressure on Rishi Sunak to ease the inflationary squeeze. Sunak said: “The UK economy recovered quickly from the worst of the pandemic and our growth in the first few months of the year was strong, faster than the US, Germany and Italy, but I know these are still anxious times. “Our recovery is being disrupted by Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine and other global challenges but we are continuing to help people where we can.” Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow chancellor said the figures for gross domestic product would increase the public’s worries and urged the chancellor to produce an emergency mini-budget – a call echoed by the British Chambers of Commerce. In March, activity fell by 0.2% in services and production – two of the three main sectors of the economy – with only construction expanding. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: “The economy barely kept its head above the water during a volatile start to the year, but times look set to get that bit tougher. “Cost pressures and rising prices have tightened their grip, with both businesses and households feeling the pinch. The end result is a weaker economic outlook.” The ONS said the economy grew by 0.8% in the first three months of 2022 but this was entirely due to a strong performance in January as restrictions to combat the Omicron variant of Covid 19 were eased. Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics. said: “The UK economy grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and is now clearly above pre-pandemic levels, although growth in the latest three months was the lowest for a year. “This was driven by growth in a number of service sectors as the economy continued to recover from Covid-19 effects, including hospitality, transport, employment agencies and travel agencies. There was also strong growth in IT.” “There were, though, some downwards effects from other services, including retailing, wholesaling and car sales and also health, due to continuing decreases in the Test and Trace service and vaccination programmes. “Our latest monthly estimates show GDP fell a little in March, with drops in both services and in production.

5/12/2022,"In vitro fertilization treatment is facing a “clear and present danger” and could be a “casualty” of some of the proposed anti-abortion laws that are emerging across the US, according to a key advocate of reproductive medicine. The warning comes as US states, including Louisiana, have passed or are debating new proposed legislation that would give full rights to embryos, which in some cases means fertilized eggs, created in the process of IVF and not implanted in a woman, would have the same legal rights as children. “What we’re seeing is that in their fervor to curry the most favor with the forced birth movement, politicians are crafting some really sloppily worded legislation,” said Sean Tipton, the chief advocacy and policy officer of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. “There is a fever to be as restrictive as you can.” Experts say that the passage of so-called “personhood” laws, which give rights to fertilized eggs, could dramatically curtail the availability and practice of IVF in some states, and could in effect make it illegal for IVF facilities to freeze or discard embryos created in the process. Tipton said he believed that proposed laws – which could be passed if Roe v Wade is overturned by the supreme court in coming weeks – could have “unintended consequences” on issues ranging from ectopic pregnancies to IVF. If, for example, Tipton said, laws are not written to give doctors the right to perform abortions for women who have an ectopic pregnancy, it would represent a “death sentence for the mother”. While most Republican legislators have not explicitly criticized IVF, some of the most extreme anti-abortion activists – especially those affiliated with the Catholic church – have long been critical of the practice. Steve Aden, chief legal officer for Americans United for Life, recently likened the process of IVF to “eugenics”, a term coined in the 1880s which refer to the bogus science of selecting desirable characteristics to improve and strengthen future generations. Aden said in an interview with the Guardian that “most” forms of IVF created “embryonic human beings” in a “eugenic way”, making it “inevitable” that embryos would be destroyed. “I do think that as as people understand better what IVF does – even people who are engaged in the process of IVF sometimes don’t understand the implications of it – that we will turn away from this creation and freezing of hundreds of thousands of distinct individual human beings who remain in limbo forever or are ultimately cast off as if the trash,” Aden said. “I think that’s untenable in a culture that respects all human life.” Students for Life, another anti-abortion group that has gained traction in recent years for its support of total abortion bans, has said IVF comes with its own “unique set of risks” and called it a “damaging and destructive process”. The group has instead promoted what it has called a “breakthrough” in reproductive health called NaProTechnology. The process, which is backed and promoted by Catholic institutions that oppose IVF, relies on the monitoring of cervical mucus and bleeding changes in a woman’s menstrual cycle to try to assess why a woman might be experiencing infertility. Republican legislators have in the past sought to ensure that IVF procedures were carved out of anti-abortion bans. But Tipton of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine said he believed some legislators were increasingly seeing “scientific realities” as political “compromises”. If the draft decision that was leaked last week that overturns Roe vs Wade is ultimately passed by the supreme court, it would leave questions around abortion up to individual states. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who sided with the majority in the draft opinion, was asked about her views about IVF during her 2020 confirmation hearing. The questions followed a report in the Guardian that detailed how, years earlier, when Barrett was a law professor at Notre Dame, she publicly stated her opposition to Roe v Wade and signed a newspaper advertisement by an extreme anti-abortion organization that said it believed life began at “fertilization”, a common refrain for anti-abortion groups that oppose IVF and certain forms of contraception. The organization, called St Joseph County Right to Life, has said it believes that discarding excess embryos created during the IVF process was akin to the act of having an abortion and that the process of discarding embryos ought to be criminalized. Pressed on the matter by Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, Barrett said the statement she signed had validated the views of her church. She declined to answer questions about whether criminalizing IVF would be constitutional, saying the question was “abstract”. Barrett said in her confirmation hearings that her personal religious views would not have a bearing on her legal judgements. In Indiana, before she was a supreme court justice, Barrett served on the council of St Joseph Catholic church, which is part of the Fort Wayne-South Bend diocese in Indiana. The diocese has spoken forcefully against IVF, including one 2019 newsletter report by a priest, Tadeusz Pacholczyk, who said creating children in the “cold, clinical and commercial venture that is in vitro fertilization” was an act against the “human dignity of our offspring”. “The heart of the IVF process itself, the practice of joining sperm and egg together in the fertility clinic, remains an intrinsic evil, flowing from the decision to allow our offspring to be “manufactured,” he wrote.",News/US news,IVF treatment faces ‘clear and present danger’ from US anti-abortion effort,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/12/ivf-treatment-us-anti-abortion-laws-bills
5/12/2022,"The UK government has been urged to give the hunger crisis gripping the Horn of Africa “proper attention”, as new polling showed just two in 10 people in Britain are aware that the worst drought in 40 years is even taking place, let alone threatening famine. As the war in Ukraine rages, the combined effect of three failed rainy seasons has pushed parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia to the brink, killing livestock, forcing people to leave their homes and increasing levels of child malnutrition. The Russian invasion has exacerbated the situation, pushing up the price of staples such as wheat and sunflower oil, as well as fuel. However, according to polling commissioned by Christian Aid, while 91% of the British public is aware of Vladimir Putin’s war, only 23% know about the worsening humanitarian crisis in east Africa. Patrick Watt, CEO of Christian Aid, said the findings were “deeply concerning”. “Across the Horn of Africa, up to 20 million people are facing hunger. Droughts have become increasingly severe and frequent, and so this is not a surprise. However, the war in Ukraine has turned a bad situation into a dire crisis. With rocketing food and energy costs around the globe, we are seeing people in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia facing a crisis like no other,” said Watt. “While we cannot thank the public enough for their response to humanitarian needs in Ukraine, the fact that so few people in Britain are aware of the crisis in the Horn of Africa is deeply concerning.” For months, international NGOs and UN agencies have been warning that, while welcome and necessary, the unprecedented outpouring of funding and compassion for Ukraine is diverting attention from some of the world’s other humanitarian crises. In Somalia, about 6 million people, 40% of the population, are suffering extreme levels of hunger, and the World Food Programme warned last month there was “a very real risk of famine” if the drought continued and assistance wasn’t received. In Kenya, the number of people in need of food assistance has risen more than fourfold in less than two years, WFP said. In southern and south-eastern Ethiopia an estimated 7.2 million people wake up hungry every day, it added. With the G7 foreign ministers meeting in Germany this week, a coalition of aid charities is urging the UK government to act to prevent famine, keep food affordable and commit to reversing its cuts to international aid. “We must sound the alarm and give hope to people in need in the region. The cost of living crisis is global and demands urgent action from the government and the development sector,” Watt said.

A search through the major party leaders’ public appearances over the past week reveals little-to-no discussion of climate science, how the country should adapt to deal with worsening extreme events or the news that 91% of reefs surveyed on the Great Barrier Reef recently bleached. But climate change policy, and its impact on consumers, still rears its head. With nine days ago, here are some of the claims being made by Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese in press conferences, interviews and debates, and how they stack up. Morrison: “The teal independents are putting forward policies that the government doesn’t support. I mean, we don’t support a 60% reduction in emissions. That would be catastrophic for our economy.” Reality: Morrison presumably doesn’t mean what he says here. The Coalition’s policy remains to reach net zero emissions by 2050 – though that is a point of internal contention. It suggests Morrison thinks the country can make a 60% cut and avoid economic catastrophe at some point between 2030 and 2050. When? He hasn’t said. Might be a good question for someone to ask. The government’s net zero plan does not actually map a path to net zero. It suggests new cheap clean technology will arrive after 2030 and business and consumers will adopt it. Several analyses have found much of the technology needed already exists and that an emissions cut of more than 60% – in the ballpark of what Australia could do to help limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial times – could be reached by 2030 without wrecking the economy. Corporate Australia mostly hasn’t gone as far as 60%, but key players support a 50% cut by 2030 as good for the economy and have suggested how it could be reached. Morrison: “We’re already 20% down on our 2005 [emissions] levels.” Reality: True – but the bulk of the cut happened when Labor was in power between 2007 and 2013. It was mostly due to state policies that slowed the country’s extraordinary pace of forest destruction for agriculture, particularly in Queensland. Government climate data suggests Australia is still clearing native forests, just at a slower pace (though there is some evidence that emissions from the land may be higher than reported). Either way, fossil fuel emissions – the main game – were rising before the Covid-19 lockdowns hit due to increases from transport, mining and major industry. Government projections suggest those sectors will do little to reduce their impact before 2030 under current policies. Morrison: “We are investing $22bn to take us to meeting our net zero [target] by 2050.” Reality: More than half the $22bn investment Morrison touts is just topped-up funding for existing government agencies until 2030. Most of that is dedicated to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, sometimes called the green bank, which the government wants to expand to invest in gas-fired power. The $22bn includes additional spending outside the agencies on gas, “clean” hydrogen – including hydrogen made with fossil fuels as well as renewable energy – and attempts to develop carbon capture and storage to limit emissions from fossil fuels. The budget papers showed the Morrison government expects its annual spending on climate change will fall by 35%, from $2bn to $1.3bn, over the next four years. Morrison: Electricity prices have come down by more than 10% “and there are many reasons for us being able to achieve that”. Reality: Not exactly a climate claim, but it goes to the continuing weaponisation of climate policy – basically, the idea that more action would be terrible for power prices that are otherwise coming down. The reality is that while it is true that power bills have come down over the past couple of years, Morrison’s repeated claim about what his government has been “able to achieve” is a selective take. As the University of Melbourne’s Dylan McConnell has shown, the national retail electricity price increased by nearly 20% under the Coalition in 2017-18, largely due to the skyrocketing cost of gas power and the closure of the Hazelwood coal-fired plant in Victoria. It then started to come down – gradually at first, and more significantly after 2019. They are now roughly back to where they were in 2016. In part, this was due to the influx of cheap solar and wind energy into the grid – a shift the Coalition has taken steps to slow. But the key point about Morrison’s power bills claim is that it ignores what is happening right now. Wholesale prices – which make up roughly a third of the bill – have more than doubled due to outages at old, failing coal plants and the impact of Russia invading Ukraine. This is starting to flow through to bills. Power prices are going up whoever wins the election. Tony Wood, from the Grattan Institute, has suggested the default offer for consumers might increase by 5-10%. Will the Morrison government also take responsibility for that?

Reality: We have already written about this. The claim was initially made by Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister: nothing has been released to back it up and no-one outside government backs it. Morrison continues to roll it out at press conferences. Labor says modelling by the consultants RepuTex suggests this would lead to power bills coming down by $275 by 2025 and $378 by 2030. Morrison has quoted several organisations – Frontier Economics, the Victorian Energy Policy Centre and the Grattan Institute – as agreeing that Labor’s sums are implausible. This is broadly true, with some caveats: these organisations each have their own position, but they all either doubt or outright dismiss the suggestion that Labor’s policy will cut prices to this extent suggested. None of them endorse the Coalition’s position either. All believe significant additional investment – whether in transmission, batteries, other “firming” power or all of the above – will be needed whoever is in government. Albanese: Compared to a carbon pricing scheme, which is backed by most economists, Labor has “got a better system”. Reality: Few, if any, experts agree. Labor’s main climate policies are a $20bn fund to quickly build electricity transmission links, a commitment to use the Coalition’s “safeguard mechanism” to gradually reduce industrial emissions and lower taxes on electric cars. It is a deliberately modest and piecemeal approach building on what’s already in place. Overwhelming, the expert view is a well-designed carbon price should be part of the answer. Of course, Labor once agreed: it introduced a scheme with the Greens and independents and then got badly burned at the 2013 election after imploding internally. There is no political appetite to return to a fight over a misnamed “carbon tax”, but the current policy is a reflection of what the ALP believes is electorally achievable, not best practice. Albanese: Labor’s policy will “end the climate wars” because it is supported by the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Chamber of Commerce & Industry and the ACTU. Reality: It’s true – and still extraordinary, given the history – that those groups are now comfortable with Labor’s policies. Labor based its plan for the safeguard mechanism on a business council recommendation. But many of the listed groups actually want whoever is in government after 21 May to go faster than the major parties propose (up to a 50% cut by 2030, versus Labor’s 43% and the Coalition’s 26-28%). As for ending the climate wars if Labor was elected … it’s not impossible. But given the history, and the ongoing attacks on climate action from the Coalition and News Corp papers, the best that can be said is: good luck with that.

5/12/2022,"The Victorian opposition leader, Matthew Guy, has delivered a budget reply speech focused on attacking the government’s response to the pandemic, without announcing any new policies ahead of the November state election. Guy characterised the premier, Daniel Andrews, as an “arrogant and unchecked” leader, who would send Victoria “broke” as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns, cost overruns on major projects and record debt levels. “What we are living today is the handiwork of long-term Labor and a long-term premier. A man whose ego says, ‘I need to be here longer than Bracks’ – his ego says, ‘I need to be here longer than Kennett’,” he told parliament’s lower house on Thursday. “A man motivated by a bronze statue of himself and not motivated by fixing the many problems he and his government have caused.” Guy was referring to the statues outside Treasury Place, awarded to Victorian premiers who had led the state for 3,000 days or more. If Andrews wins a third election in November and serves until next May he will qualify for one, though he has said he has given no thought to the matter. The speech criticised the government’s response to the pandemic, including failures in hotel quarantine and decisions to close playgrounds, impose curfews and separate metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria at various stages. “While this horror played out and people were dying … the government’s focus was, of course, on itself. Covid management to this government was about PR management first and health second,” Guy said. He repeatedly referred to the government as a “one man show” and “Dan show”, in an apparent reference to the daily press conferences held during the state’s second wave of Covid-19. “That hectoring voice, it’s driven us all mad for far too long. We all want to change the channel,” Guy said. Treasurer Tim Pallas’s eighth budget, handed down last week, committed $12bn to repairing the healthcare system, which the government says has suffered as a result of Covid-19. The budget also outlined a path to a modest surplus in 2025/26, though debt will rise to a record $167.5bn in the same financial year. Guy said Victoria was on track to have the equivalent debt to New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia combined. “Now that’s a special kind of recklessness. Who would have thought that in 2014 when the government changed and Labor came to office, and debt levels were around $20bn, that we’d be genuinely looking at putting another zero on that within two terms of office? And let’s not believe the lie that it was all for Covid,” he said. While not unveiling any new election promises, Guy repeated commitments outlined earlier this year, including a commitment to no longer impose lockdowns, fix the state’s healthcare and mental health “crisis” and slash hospital waiting lists, cut the cost of living and build an infectious disease hospital. He has previously said the initiatives would be funded by reining in over-spending on the government’s infrastructure projects. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Asked what he made of the speech, Andrews told reporters outside parliament: “I’m not here to respond to the leader of the opposition and his politics.” He said he will outline the government’s “positive, optimistic plan” for Victoria in the months before the November election. “Victorians at that point will have a very clear choice between those who build and invest and get things done – our Labor government – or an alternative, which is people who, whenever they get a chance, cut the things that matter most. Hospitals, schools, auditing projects – just a fancy word for all the building that’s been going on grinding to a halt,” Andrews said. “My job is to govern and then to put a positive plan before the community and that’s what I’ll do.”",News/Australia news,Matthew Guy uses budget reply speech to attack Victoria’s response to the pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/matthew-guy-uses-budget-reply-speech-to-attack-victorias-response-to-the-pandemic
5/12/2022,"Good morning. It’s quite hard to visualise a number like 646 gigatons. That’s the amount of CO2 emissions which will be produced by 195 major fossil fuel projects currently in the works, and I can tell you that it’s about the same weight as 627bn Volkswagen Polos or 3,230bn Shetland ponies, but that probably isn’t a lot of help. Luckily, there are more straightforward descriptions available. 646 gigatons in emissions is, on its own, 146 gigatons more than the entire carbon budget available if we are to have a chance of avoiding catastrophic global heating. And the projects that will produce those emissions are known as carbon bombs. Damian Carrington, the Guardian’s environment editor, knew that major oil and gas firms had a lot of these projects under way – but the data on the scale of the problem just wasn’t available. So, along with a number of other Guardian journalists, he set about finding it. The results are at the heart of a remarkable investigation published yesterday online and on the front of today’s print edition. For this morning’s newsletter, I spoke to Damian about the challenges of reporting the story, and what he made of the results. That’s right after the headlines. Brexit | Liz Truss has been warned of a major rebellion over plans for a bill that could revoke parts of the Northern Ireland protocol. Ministers were said to be ready to resign rather than vote to support such a bill. Cost of living crisis | The Treasury moved to dampen speculation on new measures to tackle the cost of living. Sources played down the possibility after Boris Johnson appeared to suggest that an announcement was imminent. Defence | Finland and Sweden are both expected to announce bids to join Nato, with membership expected to be granted swiftly. Boris Johnson signed mutual security agreements with the two countries yesterday, promising mutual support against potential Russian threats. Middle East | Veteran Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh has been killed by Israeli forces while reporting on a military raid. Al Jazeera said Abu Akleh was shot despite wearing a helmet and body armour that were clearly marked “press”. Social media | Allowing Donald Trump to return to Twitter will prompt a backlash and clash with online safety laws, Elon Musk has been warned. Musk, who is in the process of buying Twitter, said Trump’s removal was “foolish in the extreme”. So let’s begin with a definition: a carbon bomb is an oil or gas project which will result in at least a billion tonnes of CO2 emissions over its lifetimes. Massive though these projects are, Damian Carrington says, “getting hold of solid information about them is an absolute nightmare”. “We’re talking about future projects, and that means you’re dealing with uncertainty. And the big oil and gas companies are … not all that open about it. There’s some information out there, but it’s not in the same format, or it’s hidden away, and a lot of it is extremely technical. Yeah, this was a big old thing.” To achieve the big old thing, Damian led a team of Guardian reporters who hunted out the information wherever they could find it – working with thinktanks, academics, analysts, and retrieving what they could from private industry databases to piece it together. “It was pretty messy,” Damian said. “Fortunately, we worked with some very big brains, people who spend their lives going through these things, who could help us wrangle 40,000 line spreadsheets into forms we could make sense of. And then we had to build the clearest view possible of this paradox – that the climate crisis is real, and accepted, but we are still planning to produce way more oil and gas than we can safely burn.” The resulting stories are rich, detailed, worrying, but remarkably clear. Damian’s lead piece is well worth reading in full – but here are just a few of the takeaways: Oil and gas giants’ investment in renewables is relatively tiny That 646 gigaton figure, remember, is far from a complete picture of future emissions: it ignores the production of cement and steel, deforestation, the ongoing burning of coal, and anything at all which isn’t CO2 produced by a carbon bomb. There was another figure in Damian’s story that has stuck with him: the dozen biggest players are on track to spend at least $103m a day for the rest of the decade on exploiting new oil and gas fields that cannot be burned if global heating is to be kept well below 2c, the internationally agreed target. “More than $100m a day! That really made my eyes widen,” he said. “It’s an extraordinary sum.” And, whatever their rhetoric, it dwarves the amounts the same companies are committing to investments in renewable energy. If the press releases tell you one thing, and the financial statements tell you another, it’s not difficult to see which is the better guide. The US is a huge part of the problem We’re used to seeing the Middle East and Russia as the leading enthusiasts for future oil and gas projects, but new research shared with the Guardian reveals that the US is the leading source of potential emissions through carbon bombs. Canada and Australia also feature high on the list. A forthcoming study shared with the Guardian and reported by Nina Lakhani and Oliver Milman estimates that new fracking projects in the US will release 140bn metric tons of planet-heating gases over their lifetime if fully realised - four times more than the entire world produced last year. And domestic drilling is only expected to increase in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “I was surprised that the US was number one,” said Damian. “It’s only a decade ago that the US was a big importer of fossil fuels. But the fracking revolution has really changed things. And that creates the very difficult situation of, on the one hand, John Kerry striding around the world trying to lead on climate action, and on the other the US OK-ing all of these projects and looking to expand on them.” Fossil fuel firms don’t believe governments’ carbon pledges This is fairly straightforward: if these companies seriously believed that world governments were going to keep global emissions somewhere close to a 1.5C rise by 2050, they would not be pumping money into the projects that are bound to bust that target. Damian’s story puts it starkly: “These firms are in effect placing multibillion-dollar bets against humanity halting global heating.” One reason for that problem: while companies like ExxonMobil and Shell are the most familiar corporate faces of fossil fuel extraction to most people in the West, about half of the industry worldwide is nationalised – “one and the same as their governments,” Damian said. “It’s hard to get governments to turn their noses up at profits which are just lying there to be taken.” Even when they are not operated by state firms, these projects are sometimes seductive enough to governments to be forced through against the objections of local residents. To zoom in on one example of that, read Eleanor de Jong and Adam Morton’s report on a $12bn carbon bomb in Australia which protesters from the Murujuga First Nations community say will destroy unique local marine life and damage irreplaceable carvings dating back 50,000 years. The companies are too committed to change course on their own Even if fossil fuel firms are persuaded of the seriousness of the global commitment to staving off the worst impacts of the climate crisis, Damian adds, they are already highly committed to their carbon bomb projects – with 60% already pumping and many others well on the way. “There is only a relatively small amount of oil and gas that can be still be burned without disaster and they are all chasing the same prize - but they can’t all do it,” he said. “Somebody once made this nice analogy to me – it’s like they’re all on a train heading towards a broken bridge across a ravine, and they all say, I’ll be the last one off. But if they all try to get off at the same time, they’re going to get stuck in the door.” We have the technical capacity to turn this around – but very little time “It’s not technicalities or the legal side that are stopping this from changing,” said Damian. “It’s the political will. That’s the good news, in a way: we know what the solution is. But that is as far as the good news goes. It’s not quite too late, but we have a very, very very small window of time to act.” Matthew Katzman didn’t volunteer for the culture war - but when he became the target of right-wing fury over a stunningly trivial story about a picture of the Queen, the consequences were life-changing all the same.
