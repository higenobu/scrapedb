4/23/2022,"The vagina is an important part of the female anatomy, but many people know very little about it. ""When we do exams in the office, we get out a mirror, show women their vaginas and point out the anatomy of the area,"" Dr. Lauren Streicher, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and creator of the podcast Dr. Streicher's Inside Information, tells Yahoo Life. ""For the majority of women, this is the first time they take a close look."" Many people, Streicher adds, ""don't know the correct terminology and anatomy"" for describing the area. Dr. Christine Greves, an ob-gyn at the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies in Orlando, agrees. ""A lot of women don't know a whole lot about their vaginas,"" she tells Yahoo Life. As Dr. Jennifer Wider, a women's health expert, tells Yahoo Life, ""Whether the fault lies in sex education in the schools, public health messaging, self-reluctance or a combination, not knowing and understanding how the entire body functions and what is normal or abnormal could have health consequences. ""It’s vital to understand our bodies,"" she says, ""even the parts we can’t see all that well."" With that in mind — and in honor of National Vagina Appreciation Day on April 23 — we checked in with some ob-gyns and came back with a few fascinating facts about vaginas. The vagina is sometimes compared to a ""self-cleaning oven,"" as Greves puts it. The bacteria in the vagina include good bacteria called lactobacillus, she says, adding that they work something like a robot vacuum. ""It just takes care of your vagina,"" Greves says. ""If you have the appropriate amount of lactobacillus, it's able to combat the bad bacteria and yeast that could overgrow otherwise."" The vagina also sheds its outermost cells to clean itself, flushing them out in discharges and mucus, Wider says. Horror stories float around online about women ""losing"" tampons in their vagina, but although foreign objects can get stuck in the vagina, losing them isn't possible, Streicher says. ""Everybody thinks the vagina is this open-ended road, but the truth is that it's a dead end,"" she says. ""You can't lose a tampon or anything in there, because it stops at the dead end."" For most women, she says, that's the cervix, the lower part of the uterus, which typically only opens during childbirth. In a hysterectomy, the back of the vagina is sewn closed, ""So it's still a dead end,"" Streicher explains. Ob-gyns say they often hear their patients confusing the two. ""I still have women come into the office and say that their vagina hurts when they mean their vulva,"" Greves says. ""People just use one term for the entire area."" Streicher agrees. ""No one uses the term 'vulva,'"" she says. ""But the vagina is completely internal. Anything you see is the vulva."" Streicher says the reason for this is probably cultural. ""Little girls aren't taught the proper terminology, and no one uses it,"" she says. Most women aren't aware of this, Streicher says, but ""During arousal, there is increased blood flow to the genitalia,"" she explains. ""It also lengthens in order to accommodate a penis — biologically, that's why we have sex."" In general, ""the aroused vagina is longer and a little more dilated than a non-aroused vagina,"" she adds. Despite the frequent use of douches and other feminine deodorizing products, Streicher points out that it's ""normal for a vagina to have a scent."" (The use of douches and deodorant sprays are not recommended by ob-gyns, since they can lead to vaginal infections.) ""It's normal for the vagina to have a light scent,"" Streicher says. However, a strong, foul odor or fishy smell could be the sign of an infection — such as bacterial vaginosis, the most common vaginal infection in women — and should prompt a trip to the doctor, she says. Just like other body parts, every vulva and vagina looks slightly different. ""Many women feel self-conscious about the appearance of their vulva, but they shouldn’t,"" Wider says. ""Vulvae come in all different shapes and sizes. There is a wide range of normal."" Greves agrees, noting that the labia (the folds of skin around the vaginal opening) can be longer in some women and asymmetrical. ""Every one is different,"" she adds.

4/23/2022,"Matt Gaetz criticized Kevin McCarthy after a tape leaked of McCarthy saying he would push Trump to resign as president. McCarthy made those comments on January 10, 2021, days after the Capitol riot. Gaetz said, ""You should have trusted my instincts, not your own."" GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz on Friday slammed House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy after an audiotape leaked of Trump-critic Rep. Liz Cheney and McCarthy discussing how to get President Donald Trump to resign shortly after the January 6 Capitol riot. ""While I was rallying in Wyoming against Liz Cheney … Kevin McCarthy was defending Liz Cheney among House Republicans,"" Gaetz wrote on Twitter. ""@GOPLeader - you should have trusted my instincts, not your own."" Gaetz's and other loyal MAGA lawmakers' reactions will be closely watched in the wake of the tape's release. In an audio recording first played on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow show on Thursday night, McCarthy can be heard talking to Cheney about what to do about Trump in the wake of the insurrection. ""I'm seriously thinking of having that conversation with him tonight. I haven't talked to him in a couple days,"" McCarthy tells Cheney, then-the No.3 House Republican, and other top party leaders during a call on January 10, 2021, referring to Trump. ""But what I think I'm going to do, is I'm going to call him. This, this is what I think, we know that it'll pass the House. I think there's a chance it'll pass the Senate, even when he's gone."" McCarthy was talking about pushing for Trump to resign in the face of a possible swift and bipartisan impeachment effort to remove him from office. His comments are all the more notable because McCarthy has publicly denied that he ever considered pushing for Trump to resign. He issued a blanket denial of his reported comments from the forthcoming book by two New York Times reporters, ""This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for American Democracy."" If Republicans were to retake the House in November, McCarthy would be in line to become Speaker of the House. But depending on how many seats Republicans flip, he could have very little room to lose support from far-right lawmakers like Gaetz. Gaetz also accused Cheney of recording and leaking the audio from the call. Cheney has denied the claim. McCarthy defended Cheney from Trump and fellow GOP critics for months before bowing to an effort by Republicans to force her from her leadership post. He now opposes her reelection. ""The select committee has asked Kevin McCarthy to speak with us about these events but he has so far declined. Representative Cheney did not record or leak the tape and does not know how the reporters got it,"" Cheney's office said in a statement to CNN. A representative for McCarthy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

4/23/2022,"Donald Trump Jr. previously railedagainst mask mandates aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, but former President Donald Trump’s eldest son admitted on Thursday that he would continue to mask up. Why? “For anonymity,” so he can “stay under the radar,” he wrote on Twitter. He’s not alone. Trump Jr.’s admission came as he questioned polling showing the majority of Americans support mask mandates on airplanes and trains after a federal judge struck down the federal coronavirus mask mandate on public transportation. The Department of Justice is appealing the ruling. “Must be a lib poll,” the Trump scion wrote, noting how “about 90%” of people he’d seen while flying out of airports in Miami and Cleveland this week weren’t wearing face coverings. “I’m sitting in an airport now and I can see 60+ people and can count 5 masks including me but I’m wearing one for anonymity not bc I think a small cloth does anything,” Trump Jr. added. Must be a lib poll. I’ve flown out of Miami & Cleveland in the last 2 days and about 90% of people are massless.

4/23/2022,"LONDON — The first shipments of the Biden administration’s $800 million military aid package have arrived in Ukraine. Included among the first round of weapons are 18 155 mm howitzers, in addition to another 72 cannons that were announced this week. The howitzers heading to Ukraine will have a “significant” impact on Ukrainian firepower, according to a senior U.S. defense official, as the war with Russia enters its third month. A howitzer is a short cannon, placed at a steep angle of descent, used to fire at relatively high trajectories. The cannons can fire up to four rounds per minute, according to the U.S. Army. The weapons can be traced back to the 15th century when similar models were used by the Czechs and were known as “houfnice” cannons. Since World War I, the word “howitzer” has been used to describe these weapons. The Department of Defense confirmed that 18 155 mm howitzers would be sent to Ukraine as part of the $800 million in military aid. In a second $800 million military aid package, announced by Biden on Thursday, an additional 72 howitzers, 72 tactical vehicles to tow the cannons and 144,000 rounds will be sent to Ukraine. The weapons are from U.S. Army and Marine Corps stocks. A senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Wednesday that howitzer rounds, ammunition for the cannons, arrived in Europe on Tuesday to be sent to Ukraine. The official added that more were arriving on Wednesday and in the “coming days.” Training of Ukrainian soldiers on how to use the howitzers — expected to last about a week — “has begun,” a defense official said this week. The official declined to say where the training was taking place, but said it was not in Ukraine. “This is training the trainers,” the official told the Washington Examiner. “It’s a smallish number of Ukrainians, a little bit more than 50.” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told the Military Times on April 14 that there were no more plans to deploy U.S. troops to handle the training and instead, the trainees will return home to train other soldiers. The U.S. sent howitzers after Ukrainian officials asked for artillery. It is believed the cannons will play a significant role in Russia’s new battle for the Donbas region, which consists of flat, rolling plains, a defense official told Stars and Stripes. “We knew from talking to Ukrainians that artillery was going to be a critical need because of the way the terrain lays,” the official said. “And so we saw early on the Russians were moving artillery [for the battle in the Donbas].” Meanwhile, the Pentagon spokesman reiterated on Thursday that sending the assistance has been in full “consultation” with Ukraine, and that the weapons sent by the U.S. “provide enough artillery now to equip five battalions for Ukraine for potential use in the Donbas.” “I want to stress again that what we’re providing is done in full consultation with the Ukrainians and that they believe that these systems will be helpful to them in the fight,” Kirby said. “Where and when they employ them and how they employ them is, of course, up to them.” _____",World/Yahoo News,What are howitzers?
