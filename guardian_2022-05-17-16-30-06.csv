5/17/2022,"Both leaders demonstrated their walking-while-being-questioned skills on Tuesday, as Anthony Albanese brushed off persistent queries about campaign costings and Scott Morrison deflected an invitation to appear on National Indigenous Television. The Coalition also foreshadowed $3.3bn in spending cuts across the public sector to pay for its election commitments. Four sleeps to go: here’s how today unfolded. By Josh Butler Anthony Albanese again pulled up stumps on his public campaigning before lunch on Tuesday, finishing a press conference in Perth then heading back to the east coast. He wrapped his daily presser after 10 minutes, abruptly leaving as journalists pressed him on Labor’s election costings. After batting away numerous questions and saying only that the information would be released on Thursday, Albanese walked to another part of the complex. He was followed by reporters and cameras, before walking through a door that was shut behind him by a security guard. “Is this how you’ll conduct press conferences?” one journalist asked as the door closed. “You’ll have to answer eventually,” said another. Coalition finance minister Simon Birmingham posted the footage on Twitter, criticising Albanese. Mr Albanese started the campaign saying he would answer every question. Now he storms out of press conferences.Labor’s first ad said all policies were costed. Yet 4 days until #ausvotes  & none have been.Mr Albanese’s not up to the job of PM. Don’t risk his weak leadership. pic.twitter.com/Xn39NFqmvV Journalists on Albanese’s travelling press bus have been growing increasingly frustrated with the shifting “rules” by which Albanese conducts his press conferences. He has said he will give questions to “polite” reporters, has chided journalists for “interjections”, and refused to take follow-up or clarifying questions from the same person. Starting the day with a speech and Q&A at a West Australian newspaper event, the Labor leader told gathered business leaders that his “twin goals” in politics were “social good and economic growth”. Barely two minutes in, Albanese poured praise on his “good friend” McGowan, talking up the WA premier’s “true character and true leadership”. In a place as parochial as Perth, both Albanese and Scott Morrison have been tripping over themselves to plug their links to the Emperor of WA. Albanese announced $1.5bn for medical manufacturing under Labor’s National Reconstruction Fund, and a joint funding plan with the McGowan state government for $50m for an Aboriginal cultural centre in Perth. Asked what his legacy would be – win or lose on Saturday – he sat thinking for several seconds before answering “acting on climate”. But asked “will you increase your climate targets if that’s a condition of the teal independents” in a potential hung parliament, the Labor leader gave a flat and instant “no”. (Labor’s 43% pledge upgrades the Coalition’s formal target of a 26% to 28% reduction, which remains at the level first pledged by Tony Abbott.) Albanese will address Canberra’s National Press Club tomorrow and spend the final countdown to election day on the east coast. By Paul Karp Scott Morrison started the day at a project home in Zuccoli, in the Darwin satellite town of Palmerston in the Labor-held electorate of Lingiari. His wife, Jenny, has become a fixture of the final week of the campaign, and the couple met Country Liberal Party candidates Tina MacFarlane and Damien Ryan. For the second day in a row, Morrison met a few first home buyers and recipients of the government’s $25,000 Homebuilder grant, before spruiking the super for housing policy. At his press conference, he warned Territorians to be fearful of the Chinese government, before a round of local radio interviews arguing the NT government needs to “get on top of law and order issues”. At his next stop, the Palmerston Over 50s Tuesday club, he commented to a group of seniors that he didn’t want people “living in fear” in their communities and they should “be able to walk around freely”. Nor should they fear the pandemic, which should be treated like the flu now and social connections maintained, he said. There were 251 new cases of Covid on Monday in the NT, and 1,962 active cases. So China: be afraid. Crime: already feared but ideally it shouldn’t be. Coronavirus: nothing to fear despite active cases. What’s most notable about Morrison’s whirlwind photo opportunities is that he is only meeting a few young people at a time, when they’re pre-vetted, and ideally recipients of Homebuilder grants. Retirees and over-50s are safer for Morrison, and can be risked in medium-sized groups. Morrison also faced questions from SBS about why he wasn’t making announcements on Indigenous issues, and whether a Coalition minister would appear on NITV. (He briefly mentioned Coalition efforts to close the gap before he hopped in a vehicle and the door closed.) SBS Political Correspondent @ShubaSKrishnan tried to get the Prime Minister on why no one from the Coalition was available for NITV while campaigning in Lingiari (the seat with the highest percentage of Aboriginal voters in the country)Here is the response. 👇🏽 👇🏽👇🏽 pic.twitter.com/B1PCjWu7GE Morrison’s last stop for the day was at CareFlight in Darwin, where he spruiked (old) money contained in the budget for emergency flying medical services. Coalition costings: The Coalition says spending cuts across the public sector will deliver $3.3bn in savings to pay for its election commitments, as the government turns the pressure on Labor to submit its plans to Treasury for costing. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and finance minister, Simon Birmingham, released the Coalition costings in Melbourne on Tuesday, revealing that the proposed increase to the public sector efficiency dividend and changes to super contributions would offset the $2.3bn in new spending promises made by the Coalition since the beginning of the election campaign. Secret weapon?: Labor is deploying frontbencher Penny Wong to the electorates of Brisbane and Higgins in the final days of the election campaign, as the opposition becomes increasingly bullish about its prospects in the Liberal-held seats due to voter disaffection with Scott Morrison. Strategists say Labor’s internal polling points to opportunity in four Liberal-held seats – Brisbane and Ryan in Queensland, Bennelong in Sydney and Higgins in Victoria – because disapproval of Morrison is high in these electorates and disaffected centrist progressive voters don’t have a teal independent to back. Pay pressure: Scott Morrison has softened his language on pay increases as he faces mounting concern about the cost of living, stating “wage rises are good things”. The prime minister on Tuesday also urged drivers to dob in operators suspected of price gouging on petrol. Morrison made the comments in the Northern Territory ahead of Wednesday’s release of the latest wage statistics, which will show whether the Reserve Bank’s prediction of an increase in pay has materialised. Western Sydney: There is a growing “electoral volatility” in western Sydney, with experts saying residents have “departed from the script” in a region which could prove critical to deciding the federal election. A new study from the Centre for Western Sydney that analysed federal election voting patterns found a level of volatility above national trends. Five of western Sydney’s 14 federal electorates are now marginal, with the report outlining a confluence of issues that are combining to alter the electoral landscape. Aukus latest: Scott Morrison’s Aukus middleman has not lobbied any US officials since the landmark security deal was announced, despite a previous agreement with the prime minister “to engage with US personnel to facilitate Australia’s engagement with US and UK per Aukus agreement”, according to a newly filed document. The other mob are hiding until Thursday to bring it out … that’s not how you should treat the Australian people. – The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, blasts Labor for not releasing its costings document until the Thursday before the election, without mentioning that the then-Coalition opposition did the very same thing before winning the 2013 election.

5/17/2022,"Jake Daniels, the UK’s first male professional footballer to come out as gay since 1990, has been lauded for his bravery by Josh Cavallo, the Australian player whose own coming out provided inspiration for the Blackpool forward. Daniels’s announcement on Monday that “the time is right to be myself, be free and be confident” in his identity prompted widespread support from across the football world, just like Cavallo’s decision to come out last year. Daniels, 17, said he had been inspired by the Adelaide United player, who made global headlines in October when he became the only openly gay man playing top-flight professional football anywhere in the world. At the time, Cavallo said he suspected there were other players “living in silence”, but until Daniels’s landmark revelation, no other gay men had felt comfortable enough to go public with their sexuality. Cavallo, whose team meet Melbourne City this week in a two-leg A-League Men semi-final, said on Tuesday he was proud to have been able to help provide Daniels with the confidence to make the public revelation. “As myself and Adelaide United prepare for the A-League semi-final, I want to stop and take a moment to acknowledge Jake’s announcement and say how very proud I am for his bravery,” Cavallo said. “It’s a wonderful feeling knowing that my story has helped guide Jake to be his true self. “It’s touching to see the millions of people that my story has impacted and inspired around the world, and to see it help evolve the world game at all levels, is fantastic. This world and the game of football has a place for everyone. Love will always win.” Gerard Piqué, Raphaël Varane and Marcus Rashford congratulated Cavallo last year, and there was no shortage of big names lining up to praise Daniels on Monday; Harry Kane, David de Gea, Gary Lineker and Rio Ferdinand were among those to offer support to the promising striker. But football’s apparent inability to keep pace with wider societal advances on inclusivity was put into sharp relief for Cavallo in January, when he was targeted by homophobic abuse from the crowd during an A-League Men game at Melbourne Victory. There have been only a handful of openly gay male players, and none besides Daniels and Cavallo have come out while actively playing top-flight football. Thomas Hitzlsperger of Germany is arguably the most high profile, although, like the American former Leeds player Robbie Rogers, he waited until after retirement to reveal his sexuality publicly. In 2019, the former Newcastle Jets player Andy Brennan became Australia’s first professional male footballer to come out while still playing.",Sport/Football,‘Proud of his bravery’: Josh Cavallo reacts to Jake Daniels coming out as gay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/17/josh-carvallo-reacts-jake-daniels-coming-out-as-gay-footballer
5/17/2022,"The US’s most powerful pro-Israel lobby group is pouring millions of dollars into influencing Democratic congressional primary races to counter growing support for the Palestinian cause within the party, including elections today in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s money is focused on blocking female candidates who, if elected, are likely to align with “the squad” of progressive members of congress who have been critical of Israel. But it is funneled through a group, the United Democracy Project (UDP), that avoids mention of its creation by Aipac and seeks to decide elections by funding campaign messages about issues other than Israel. The UDP has thrown $2.3m in to Tuesday’s Democratic primary race for an open congressional seat in Pennsylvania – one of a handful of contests targeted by the group where a leading candidate is overtly sympathetic to the Palestinians. The money has mostly been spent in support of a former Republican congressional staffer turned Democrat, Steve Irwin, in an attempt to block a progressive state representative, Summer Lee, who is leading in opinion polls in the solidly Democratic district which includes Pittsburgh. Lee has spoken in support of setting conditions for the US’s considerable aid to Israel, has accused Israel of “atrocities” in Gaza, and has drawn parallels between Israeli actions and the shooting of young black men in the US. She is endorsed by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, members of “the squad” who support the Palestinian cause. Irwin has defended Israeli government policies and questioned whether Lee has “a strong conviction that Israel has a right to exist”. The UDP has also spent $2m in support of North Carolina state senator Valeria Foushee in today’s Democratic primary in an attempt to block Nida Allam, the political director of Senator Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign and the first Muslim American woman to hold elected office in North Carolina. Allam has participated in pro-Palestinian rallies and has been endorsed by members of the squad. She has also spoken out against antisemitism. Aipac launched the UDP in December as a super political action committee, or Super Pac, which is permitted to spend without restriction in support of candidates but cannot make direct donations to campaigns. The lobby group’s move into financial support for political campaigns for the first time in its 70 year history was prompted by alarm in Washington and Israel at the erosion of longstanding bipartisan support for the Jewish state in the US. Opinion polls show younger Democrats are growing more critical of Israel, including American Jews, and that there is rising support for the Boycott, Sanctions and Divest (BDS) movement. Israel is also concerned by the breaking of a longstanding taboo on comparing Israel’s domination of the Palestinians to apartheid South Africa after the publication of a series of international and Israeli human rights groups reports accusing Israel of practicing a form of apartheid. The UDP has also spent $1.2m to protect the Texas Democratic congressman, Henry Cuellar, who faces a run-off later next week against Jessica Cisneros, a 28-year-old immigration lawyer who has spoken in support of the Palestinians and is endorsed by members of the squad. Cuellar is described as an ally by Aipac and co-founded the Congressional Caucus for the Advancement of Torah Values to combat “anti-Israel bigotry”. After Amnesty International joined other human rights groups in accusing Israel of imposing apartheid, Cuellar accused the group of endangering Jews. “Israel is not an apartheid state. Full stop. These inaccuracies incite antisemitic behavior against the Jewish people,” he tweeted. A smaller and more liberal pro-Israel group, J-Street, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of Cisneros, saying she is committed to a more just solution to the conflict with the Palestinians. J-Street’s spokesperson, Logan Bayroff, accused Aipac of being a Republican front organisation that strongly supported Donald Trump, and of attempting to intimidate candidates into avoiding criticism of Israel by implicitly threatening to fund campaigns against them. “Aipac are taking all this money from Republican donors, and they’re obfuscating the fact that they’re a very Republican-aligned organisation while trying to persuade Democratic voters who they should support,” he said. “The United Democracy Project sounds innocuous and the advertising that they’re running in these districts is about healthcare and reproductive rights and things that have nothing to do with Israel. Which makes sense because those are the things that decide elections, not Israel. But the reason that they’re aligning with certain candidates is because they are more aligned with their more hawkish positions on Israel, and because they fear that other candidates will be more progressive and aligned with the Palestinians.” A UDP spokesman, Patrick Dorton, said the group was doing no more than running legitimate political advertising. “All we are doing is talking about candidate’s public record and that is something voters deserve to know,” he said. Dorton said the group will be funding more campaigns. “Our goal is to build the broadest bipartisan coalition in congress that supports the US-Israel relationship. We are proud to support pro-Israel progressive candidates including women of color,” he said. “We are looking at 10 to 15 other races where there is a pro-Israel candidate and a candidate that, if elected, would undermine the US-Israel relationship.” Earlier this year, Aipac was accused by other leading supporters of Israel of being “morally bankrupt” and of putting Israel’s interests ahead of American democracy after it launched a separate political action committee that endorsed 37 Republicans candidates who voted against certifying Biden’s victory after the 6 January 2021 storming of the Capitol. Aipac said that it supports politicians from both parties who will “advance the US-Israel relationship. “It requires bipartisan support in Congress to adopt legislation that would advance that relationship. Consequently, we support members from both parties in their election races. In addition to the Republicans we have supported, we have made contributions to over 120 House Democrats, including half of the Congressional Black Caucus, half of the House Progressive Caucus, and the top Democratic leaders in the House,” Aipac said in a statement.",News/Politics,Pro-Israel lobbying group Aipac secretly pouring millions into defeating progressive Democrats,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/17/pro-israel-lobby-defeat-democrats-palestinians-2022
5/17/2022,"Manchester City’s victory over West Ham in the semi-final meant that they were heading for Wembley for a fourth FA Cup final in the last six seasons. The match against Chelsea was a repeat of March’s League Cup final which City won 3-1. Whichever team triumphed would be winning a double, after Chelsea secured the Women’s Super League title last weekend. A victory for Emma Hayes’ side would also mean that following 2020-21’s Treble, Chelsea would have won five of the six domestic trophies on offer over the past two seasons. The two sides have developed a strong rivalry in recent years, with Chelsea’s dominance only punctured by City’s success in the cup competitions. Fans, merchandise and a police horse on a rainy Wembley Way Presenter Joelah Noble interviews Kimberly Wyatt, who is a former Pussycat Doll and is taking part in the half-time show Wembley starts to fill up with Chelsea and Manchester City fans Fans and players sing the national anthem (above); City’s Georgia Stanway and Chelsea’s Sophie Ingle in action. After a blistering start by City, with Caroline Weir going close on a couple of occasions, Chelsea steadied the ship and the game developed into a cagey one with both teams playing cautiously, desperate not to concede the first goal. Sam Kerr did breach the City defence in the 18th minute (below) when she raced through and finished with aplomb, but her effort was chalked off for offside. Kerr found the net again 15 minutes later, when she headed home Millie Bright’s looping cross. This time the goal stood, and Chelsea had the lead. Differing emotions in the stands following Kerr’s goal, while her teammates celebrate (below). Manchester City equalised just before half-time courtesy of a wonderful curling effort by Lauren Hemp, seen below surging past Chelsea defender Millie Bright. Chelsea’s lead was restored shortly after the hour mark when Erin Cuthbert’s piledriver of a shot from outside the area flew past Manchester City keeper Ellie Roeback, going in off the underside of the bar. Manchester City stepped up the pressure in the search for an equaliser and in the 89th minute, Hayley Raso chested down a long ball, held off the challenge of Magdalena Eriksson and poked the ball home, sending raptures of delight through the City fans as the game went to extra time. City carried that momentum into the first half of extra-time and went close on a number of occasions – but the pendulum swings again in the 99th minute. City’s Alanna Kennedy misjudged a bouncing ball just inside the Chelsea half, which allowed Sam Kerr time and space to break forward. From just inside the City area, the Australian hits a shot that takes a big deflection off the stretching Alex Greenwood, wrong-footing Roebuck and putting Chelsea in front for a third time. City search in vain for another equaliser but time is against them, and the final whistle sparks scenes of joy among Chelsea players and fans. The victory over City was Chelsea’s fourth FA Cup triumph, all of them under Hayes and it takes her trophy haul with the club up to 13. “That was so amazing for the women’s game today,” she said afterwards. “I love playing Manchester City – it is football of the highest level.

5/17/2022,"Spare a thought for the Conservative MP Lee Anderson, who has spent the past few days single-handedly trying to solve Britain’s cost of living crisis with very little thanks. It all started after he stated in the Commons that food banks are unnecessary in Britain because the main cause of food poverty is a lack of cooking and budgetary skills. “I think you’ll see first-hand that there’s not this massive use for food banks in this country,” the MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire proclaimed. “You’ve got generation after generation who cannot cook properly. They can’t cook a meal from scratch. They cannot budget.” Nutritious meals, he added, could be easily cooked for 30p a time. Not one to see a hole and stop digging, Anderson has launched an ill-advised media round to defend himself after a backlash, including criticism from the anti-poverty campaigner and budget cooking expert Jack Monroe. Anderson told Times Radio he was glad he had whipped up a “leftwing” furore “because at the moment all we’re hearing in chamber is ‘food bank use is on the up’”. Probably because it is. Anderson doubled down in an interview with the deputy leader of the Reclaim party, Martin Daubney, even alleging that Monroe was profiteering from the poor. Monroe has since instructed libel lawyers. It’s all very Wagatha Christie, except rather than embarrassing himself by allegedly selling soundbites to the press, Anderson is seemingly doing it for free. He is hardly the first Conservative MP to make such comments. Multiple ministers over the past decade have publicly argued there isn’t really a reason for food banks, coincidentally just as they pulled tens of billions of pounds from the social safety net. Jacob Rees-Mog thinks food banks are “rather uplifting”. Michael Gove believes those turning to food donations just haven’t made the right “decisions … to manage their finances”. Dominic Raab said people visit food banks because they have a “cashflow problem”. Indeed, Anderson isn’t the only Tory MP to make such a remark this week. On Monday, minister Rachel Maclean suggested that in the long term, people struggling with the cost of living could just take on more hours at work or move to a better-paid job. Such comments are grossly insulting at the best of times, but land particularly badly with the public in a time of a mounting food and energy costs. When people are hungry from skipping meals, I suppose they do tend to get tetchy. It would be easy to dismiss such comments as thoughtless anger-bait, but they serve a political purpose. Discrediting food banks or casting work as an easy route out of poverty suggest that hardship isn’t down to low wages, benefit cuts, high energy prices or unaffordable housing, but rather that working-class people are too stupid to budget properly or too lazy to look for a better job. This reduces the fact of millions of people going hungry and cold in this country to a few families who can’t cook. Fundamentally, such remarks attempt to shift responsibility from the government and place it firmly on the individual. If a single mum is wasting her universal credit, why should ministers increase benefits in line with inflation? Tory MPs are playing their get-out-of-jail cards, taken from the old deck that if only the poor tried hard enough, they wouldn’t be in poverty. Or as rightwing commentator Isabel Oakeshott put it recently: having to survive on low rate benefits “concentrates the mind”. It is ignorance that leads to these comments, sure, but it is also a wilful refusal to accept the facts. Charities such as the Trussell Trust have been explaining the reasons for growing use of food banks for years. (Spoiler for Anderson: it is less their copy of Nigella’s latest cookbook people have lost, more their disability benefits.) Similarly, as Monroe points out, it is not hard to understand that “30p meals” don’t actually exist, not least because buying a hot meal means being able to afford both food and the energy to cook it. These are not exactly radical ideas; even the boss of Iceland recognises that some food bank users are declining items such as potatoes because they can’t afford the energy it would take to boil them. Rightwing MPs and pundits choose to believe these myths because it suits them. It is in the Conservatives’ interests to depoliticise poverty, to propagate the idea that hardship is a result of an individual’s bad decisions rather than government policies. We see this in the bizarre trend of Tory MPs posing at food banks in their local constituencies, which is not dissimilar to an arsonist taking a selfie next to the fire. The problem for Anderson and his ilk is that the rising inflation crisis means the dots are only going to get easier for the public to join: families are well familiar with the political events that mean they’re now unable to afford the weekly shop. No amount of budgeting will help if the money coming in is less than the bills going out. What people in Britain need is benefits that match inflation, a living wage, energy profit taxes – and politicians that understand the position they’re in. I’ll give Anderson that food for thought for free.

5/17/2022,"A fresh batch of balls has been delivered to every first-class county before the County Championship fixtures this week after Dukes admitted there have been issues with some of those used so far this season. The Durham captain, Scott Borthwick, said the quality of those balls he has seen had been “shocking”. Though some counties have reported no complaints with the batch of balls they received before the start of the season, others have had repeated problems and Borthwick’s complaints came after there were seven unscheduled ball changes during Durham’s victory against Glamorgan last week, including five on a single day. Beyond going out of shape, the balls are said to have skewed games in the batters’ favour: in the entirety of the County Championship last season there were just 12 scores above 500, while this season there have already been 13 in Division One – including four last week alone – and another seven in Division Two. “The balls have been shocking this year,” Borthwick said on Sunday. “This batch are just different. They seem to go soft pretty quickly and then when they get soft they swell a bit and go out of shape. It’s something to do with Dukes, they have obviously got this batch wrong. I know the seamers want them to go back to last year’s batch because I think the seams are actually smaller on them as well, so you get a little bit less sideways movement. I guess that’s why there’s so many big scores already this season.” Dilip Jajodia, whose company British Cricket Balls Ltd produces the Dukes balls, told the Guardian he believed the problem had been addressed. “There’s been a quality issue, on the basis that balls are going out of shape,” he said. “It’s not a major issue. We’ve tightened up our process, we’re sending balls out all the time, and hopefully the feedback will be better.” One experienced bowler told the Guardian the problem has been so widespread that entire boxes of balls were being rejected and returned. Jajodia said: “We had no idea there was an issue until people started complaining. When the balls leave me I can tell you they all look perfect. When they’re played with, if there’s anything at all wrong with them it shows up. “We do everything exactly the same: the same procedures, the same raw materials. Then if there’s a problem you have to react. Unfortunately we’ve had a batch where there seems to be a problem.” Though some bowlers have identified a less prominent seam in this year’s balls they have been produced to precisely the same specifications as last year’s, even if some variation is inevitable. “Each stitcher is different,” Jajodia said. “Some pull stitches tighter than others. It’s like handwriting. “Cricket balls are made out of natural raw materials by human beings. We’ve come through a very difficult covid period that affected the entire production line and the sorting of materials, and the whole thing’s been a nightmare. We’ve had issues with staffing, issues with raw materials, and we’re trying to please everybody in difficult circumstances. “It might be there was a batch with an issue with the elasticity of the leather. One cow hide produces around 12-15 balls, you get about 40 hides in a drum, and all that takes time to work through the system. If there’s something inherently wrong with raw materials that started their journey nine months ago there’s not a lot I can do about it, and I can’t see it until they’re in use. A handmade, natural product can’t always be perfect. It amazes me how successful we are, actually.”",Sport/Sport,New balls please: counties receive fresh batch after Dukes cricket balls go soft,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/17/counties-receive-fresh-batch-after-dukes-balls-go-soft-cricket
5/17/2022,"Why are we talking about the ‘great replacement’ theory? On Saturday, a white man armed with an AR-15-style rifle entered a supermarket in Buffalo in New York state and killed 10 people, almost all of whom were African American. The gunman is suspected of having posted a 180-page racist diatribe in which he repeatedly referenced the extremist conspiracy theory known as the “great replacement”. The Buffalo shooter drew heavily on the white supremacist rantings of the gunman in the 2019 massacre at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, in which 51 people were killed. His similarly hate-filled statement was titled “The Great Replacement”. At its heart, the theory claims falsely that white people are being stripped of their power through the demographic rise of communities of color, driven by immigration. The lie has been integral to many of the most horrifying recent acts of white supremacist violence in the US. Far-right protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which led to the killing of a woman, chanted “You will not replace us”. Replacement theory featured in the rants of mass shooters at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018 in which 11 people were murdered; a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, in which 23 were killed in 2019; and a synagogue in Poway, California, the same year in which one person died. What is the theory and how did it emerge? Replacement theory is a set of racist and antisemitic paranoid lies and delusions that has cropped up around the world in the past decade. In the US it is expressed as the false idea that an elite cabal of Jews and Democrats is “replacing” white Americans with Black, Hispanic and other people of color by encouraging immigration and interracial marriage – with the end goal being the eventual extinction of the white race. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) traces replacement theory back to early 20th century French nationalism. It began to receive popular attention in 2011 with the writings of the French critic Renaud Camus. In the US, the racist ideas were initially adopted by fringe websites including the chat boards 4chan and the technically now defunct 8chan. How has it spread through US society? More recently, the idea has been enthusiastically embraced by rightwing news outlets that have injected these hate-infused falsehoods into the mainstream of American public life. In particular attention is now falling on Tucker Carlson, the most avidly watched host on Fox News. A recent deep exploration by the New York Times found that his show, Tucker Carlson Tonight, had on occasion drawn inspiration from white supremacist sites such as the neo-Nazi Stormfront. The newspaper found that in more than 400 episodes Carlson took up the idea that immigration was being exploited by elites to change the demographics of the US. Last year the ADL called for the TV host to be fired after he accused the Democrats on-air of “trying to replace the current electorate … with more obedient voters from the third world”. What has the theory done to American political debate? Having metastasized from fringe websites to Fox News, the idea of the imperiled white voter has spread its tentacles through the nation. An opinion poll last week by the Associated Press and the NORC center for public affairs research found that one in three US adults now subscribe to the false idea that a plot is under way to replace US-born Americans with immigrants, and that those US-born citizens are losing influence and power as a result. The notion has been taken up by Republican politicians at the highest levels. In the wake of the Buffalo shooting Liz Cheney, the Republican congresswoman from Wyoming, accused the leadership of her own party in the House of enabling “white nationalism, white supremacy, and antisemitism”. Cheney did not mention by name Elise Stefanik, who took over the number three role in the Republican House leadership from her after Cheney was ousted for having criticized former president Donald Trump. Stefanik has promoted a politicised version of replacement theory, claiming that Democrats are attempting a “permanent election insurrection” by seeking citizenship for undocumented immigrants in order to “overthrow our current electorate”. Other prominent Republicans who have amplified the lie include Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House, and far-right members of Congress, including Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar. Is pressure mounting for something to be done about this? Cheney has called for Republican leaders to “renounce and reject” white supremacy. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican member of Congress from Illinois, has gone further, calling for several top Republicans themselves to be replaced. “The replacement theory they are pushing/tolerating is getting people killed,” he said. Charlie Sykes, a moderate conservative commentator who edits The Bulwark, wrote that responsibility for the Buffalo murders “lies with the murderer himself … But as conservatives once understood, ideas also have consequences; and poisonous demagoguery can have deadly results”. Such comments reflect a growing unease about the accommodation with replacement theory within rightwing politics and media. So far though the criticism is coming from individuals who have been pushed into the margins of the conservative movement, with no sign of change coming from the top.",News/US news,What is ‘great replacement’ theory and how did its racist lies spread in the US?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/17/great-replacement-theory-explainer
5/17/2022,"The prime minister’s office has blocked the release of text messages that comprised Barnaby Joyce’s reports to Scott Morrison in his time as drought envoy, claiming the texts are not documents of a minister despite Joyce having staff and travel expenses paid for by taxpayers while in the role. In April, the office of the Australian information commissioner issued two rulings for two-year-old freedom of information requests for the text messages, ordering the prime minister’s office to process the requests. The PMO had initially argued that processing the requests would take too long and would be an unreasonable diversion of resources. For nine months between 2018 and 2019, while Joyce was on the backbench and before he returned to the deputy prime ministership, he served as a drought envoy, visiting and reporting back on drought-affected communities, accruing $675,000 in total expenses in that time, including the costs for two staff to assist Joyce and his normal work as a backbencher. After criticism from Labor that no public report on his work was produced, Joyce said he had sent reports via text message. “If you say a report is a written segment to the prime minister … then they definitely went to him, I definitely sent them, I sent them by SMS to him and they were read,” Joyce told the ABC in September 2019. In a decision provided to the applicants today, just days out from the federal election, the prime minister’s senior adviser, John Harris, has ruled the text messages are not the document of a minister and refused the requests. “Your purported request relates to documents that, if they existed, would not fall within the meaning of ‘an official document of a minister’ as they would not relate to the affairs of an agency or of a department of state.” No further explanation has been provided. During his time as envoy, Joyce made four trips to drought-ravaged Queensland, with about a week spent on the ground. The first was a day trip to Longreach, Bedourie and St George, for which a private charter cost more than $15,000. The second was a chartered day trip to Charleville costing $5,600 for a delivery of hay bales by the rapid relief team. The third was an overnight trip to Gympie, also by charter, costing $5,300, while the fourth was an overnight trip to Rockhampton in March 2019. Joyce made two trips to Tasmania as part of his duties, a two-day trip in March 2019, and a three-day trip in October 2018.

At the time, Joyce defended his reports to the PMO in a Facebook video, saying he provided “quite detailed” feedback, and at one point read out letters he had received from the prime minister in response to his work. “Thank you for your letters; your appraisal drawn from your on-the-ground experience and local contact with farmers and drought-affected communities plays an important part in forming our national drought response,” he recited. It is the second decision of its kind from the PMO in recent weeks, after Harris also refused a request for text messages between Morrison and prominent QAnon conspiracy theory supporter, Tim Stewart, on the basis that any such texts which might exist would not be “an official document of a minister” as they would not relate to the affairs of an agency or a department of state.",News/Australia news,"Barnaby Joyce’s drought envoy texts not ‘documents of a minister’, prime minister’s office claims",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/barnaby-joyces-drought-envoy-texts-not-documents-of-a-minister-prime-ministers-office-claims
