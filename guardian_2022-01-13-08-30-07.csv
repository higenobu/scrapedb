1/13/2022,"Hospital admissions for common childhood infections in England dropped by as much as 94% during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the first major study of its kind. Doctors have previously reported anecdotally how Covid measures such as lockdowns inadvertently led to children being better protected against other illnesses.  Now a large study by the University of Oxford has revealed the sheer scale of the “dramatic” fall in hospital admissions for a whole range of non-Covid infections in the 12 months after March 2020. Researchers found there were “substantial and sustained” reductions in admissions for common and severe childhood infections, most likely due to social distancing measures, school and workplace closures, and travel restrictions. Other measures such as enhanced cleaning, better hand hygiene, and the use of face masks may have also contributed to the reduction. Altogether, tens of thousands fewer children were admitted for bronchiolitis, meningitis, flu, tonsillitis and pneumonia and other conditions as England went into lockdown, schools closed and children’s social contacts significantly reduced. The findings were published in The BMJ. Some children with pre-existing conditions such as asthma were also “protected from severe and potentially life-threatening infection”, the study found. Before the pandemic, exacerbation of asthma caused by acute respiratory infections was one of the most common reasons for hospital admission in children. Many of the measures seen in the first year of Covid in England are unsustainable outside the pandemic, the researchers acknowledged. Such measures have also significantly had an effect on other areas of health, such as mental health. However, the researchers said the huge fall in admissions meant there should be a further evaluation of interventions that could be continued, especially during winter months, to minimise the burden on health systems and protect vulnerable children. It was previously known that child immunisation programmes globally have been disrupted since the onset of the pandemic owing to barriers in accessing or administering vaccines. Data from lab surveillance studies indicated worldwide reductions in some childhood infections. In the new study, researchers found that 12 months after the onset of the pandemic, large and sustained reductions were found in rates of hospital admissions for “a wide range of severe, respiratory, and vaccine preventable childhood infections” in England. Absolute numbers of deaths within 60 days of hospital admission for sepsis, meningitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, viral wheeze and upper respiratory tract infections also decreased. The researchers examined hospital admissions for children up to the age of 14 for common and severe childhood infections in England between March 2017 and the end of June 2021. They examined information on admissions for common respiratory infections including tonsillitis, influenza and bronchiolitis, severe invasive infections including sepsis, meningitis and a bone infection called osteomyelitis. The team also looked at admissions data for vaccine preventable diseases included measles, mumps and several bacterial causes of serious illnesses. Researchers found “substantial and sustained” reductions in hospital admissions were found for all but one – kidney infections – of the 19 conditions studied. The largest fall in admissions was for flu, with a 94% reduction in admissions from an average of 5,379 each year before the pandemic to 304 in 2020/21. For bronchiolitis, admissions decreased by more than 80% from an average of 51,655 to 9,423 in 2020/21. Tonsillitis admissions fell by 66% from more than 54,000 each year before the pandemic to just over 18,000. Meningitis admissions dropped by almost 50% from an average of 3,917 before the pandemic to 1,964 in 2020/21. “This study has shown dramatic overall reductions in hospital admissions for respiratory, severe invasive, and vaccine preventable infections in children during the Covid-19 pandemic in England,” the researchers wrote in The BMJ. “Children with potentially life threatening co-morbidities were also substantially protected. “Further evaluation of non-pharmacological interventions that could be sustained beyond the pandemic is required to inform policymakers about potential strategies, especially during winter months, to minimise the burden on health systems and protect vulnerable children. Continued monitoring of hospital admissions for these infections is required as social restrictions evolve.”",News/Science,Pandemic brought ‘dramatic’ fall in English hospital admissions for childhood infections,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/12/pandemic-brought-dramatic-fall-in-english-hospital-admissions-for-childhood-infections
1/13/2022,"Antonio Conte defended his decision to rest Hugo Lloris and start Pierluigi Gollini in goal after Tottenham’s hopes of reaching the Carabao Cup final were dashed. Gollini was at fault when Antonio Rüdiger headed Thomas Tuchel’s side into a 3-0 aggregate lead at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Wednesday night, but the Spurs manager insisted he had no regrets about picking the Italian goalkeeper instead of his captain.  Conte, who wants backing in the transfer market this month, argued he has bigger things to worry about than Lloris’s deputy and admitted his side were unable to compete with Chelsea. “Before my arrival at Tottenham, Pierluigi has always played in Carabao and the Conference League,” he said. “I think when you’re in a team like Tottenham, it’s important to give chances to the keeper because Pierluigi has shown to be reliable. Then we have to play three games in seven days against Arsenal, Leicester and Chelsea again. “I think he deserved this chance to play an important game. In this moment we cannot compare Chelsea with Tottenham. I think that Gollini played a good game. In the first game we lost 2-0, today we lost only 1-0. I think that we have to try to think about situations that are much more important than this. Believe me.” Conte also said he was following the “club line” after he dropped Tanguy Ndombelé from his matchday squad. The France midfielder was booed off during Sunday’s FA Cup win over Morecambe after he taking his time to leave the pitch when substituted. “It was a technical decision, but I don’t take the decision if I don’t consult the club,” said Conte. “There is the club line and I have to follow the club line.” Conte refused to criticise the officials after Spurs, who host Arsenal on Sunday, had two penalties and a goal correctly chalked off following VAR reviews. “I don’t like to comment on VAR decisions,” the Italian said. “I did this in the past and I’ll continue to do this in the present and in future.” Tuchel became the first manager to lead Chelsea to the finals of the Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup. “We are very happy because Wembley is waiting – full house, cup final, this is where you want to be,” the German said.",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte defends decision to rest Hugo Lloris after Chelsea defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/12/x
1/13/2022,"There was a moment midway through the first half of this Carabao Cup semi-final second leg, with Chelsea already 1-0 up, when Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic just seemed to stop, shrug, and pass the ball three times between them: a kind of shared footballing shrug, a raise of the midfield eyebrows. We can do this all day you know. You’re on your own time here. This was a game Tottenham did their best to chase, and with some urgency in the second half. But they were up against opponents who seemed always to be holding them at arm’s length, a palm flat against their forehead, arms windmilling in the space between.  There was no lack of effort from Antonio Conte’s team, no lack of shots, no lack of chaotic energy. But in the end Chelsea controlled this game without having to raise their pulse, and did so via the most diligent of midfield throttlings from that Kovacic-Jorginho fulcrum. Kovacic-Jorginho, Jorginho- Kovacic: this wasn’t always a thing. Frank Lampard tended to rotate the two, perhaps seeing a sameness, a lack of thrust, an absence of goal threat. Under Thomas Tuchel they tend to play together. And work has been done here, spaces allocated, movements drilled. Tuchel went with a back four in north London, with Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic the twin midfield prong, valve, and rotational ball carousel just in front. And at times Chelsea’s twin midfielders just seemed to orbit one another like amorous hummingbirds. Sometimes they kept the ball in their allocated space, like a whispered secret, passing to each other to rest, change the angle, find a space. Nobody is “covering every blade of grass” here or racking up the tackles. This is instead about positioning and control. And under Tuchel Kovacic and Jorginho have become one of those brilliantly frictionless things that you only notice when they’re not there, when suddenly that hum from the air conditioner breaks the silence and you realise it’s still beavering away. For long periods they sat like a fulcrum: Jorginho stays, Kovacic moves five yards on, before rotating the roles, covering that midfield like two men roped together on a mountain. Between them Jorginho-Kovacic had 128 touches in 45 first‑half minutes, or a touch every 14 seconds while the ball was in play. There are, you know chaps, 20 other players on that pitch. By the end of that half Chelsea’s central duo had completed 111 passes. Harry Winks and Pierre Emile-Højbjerg made 38 in the same time. The difference is in part tactical: Tuchel wants to keep the ball. Conte demands quick, vertical passing from his midfielders. But it’s not just tactical. It’s also a matter of, craft, impact, patterns, pitch-status, presence. There are no doubt weaknesses to this system and limitations in the game of both players, days when they will be circumvented by opponents good enough to get close. But it is also 18 months since Chelsea lost a game with both Jorghino and Kovacic on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes. What these two fine moving parts offer is control; but also an emblem of just how deep the investment in this squad goes, how high spec, how finely engineered even these everyday working parts have to be to compete at that elite level. Conte had a meeting to discuss acquisitions and departures before this game, a chance, it is to be hoped for a little upwards-management. “It was good to tell the truth,” he said afterwards. Hopefully that truth included some simple sums. Jorginho cost £50.4m, aged 26. Kovacic cost £40m, major fees for un-starry, boiler room players. By contrast Pierre-Emile Højbjerg cost £15m. Harry Winks was an in-house product. There are levels here. On 52 minutes Winks found himself in space in the centre circle, with just a simple pass required to put Kane in on goal. He spanked the ball out of play – not because he can’t make the pass, but because every moment of his game to that point had been spent chasing, harrying, trying to find a moment to let the mercury settle. And that sense of never quite landing a blow was the defining note. The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was a wonderful spectacle at kick-off, the vast craning kop seething with its own massed barks, cheers, yelps, songs. It was from a simple switch of play, Ben Davies finding Matt Doherty, that Spurs first chance came, a free-kick on the edge of the box. One day, when all this has passed, a forensic deep-dive is required into exactly who told Harry Kane, and at exactly what point, that he was good at taking free-kicks. As ever Kane paused, took a breath, felt the energy lines settle, found his inner peace, opened his footballing third eye, and smashed it into the wall. The game’s only goal arrived not long after. It came straight from a corner, headed in by Antonio Rüdiger, who stood his ground on the edge of the six-yard box as Pierluigi Gollini came cartwheeling out. This was decisive, assertive, aggressive goalkeeping from Gollini. He just missed the ball. Spurs had their moments, but there was something ragged even in their best attacks in the absence of Son Heung-min. Chelsea will now play another final, Spurs reflect on another near-miss. The reasons why are there in the detail. This isn’t a mentality thing, a hex, a witch’s curse. Chelsea simply have a better-resourced, more powerful squad – evident here in that note of high-grade control.",Sport/Football,Chelsea’s frictionless Jorginho-Kovacic axis puts Tuchel in total control | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/12/chelsea-frictionless-jorginho-kovacic-axis-puts-tuchel-in-control
1/13/2022,"Staff shortages in one of Sydney’s best-resourced hospitals have sent nurse-to-patient ratios soaring as new data shows the share of Covid patients occupying intensive care beds has shot up from one in five beds to one in three in just one week. The high dependency unit of the hospital, which treats almost two dozen patients not yet sick enough to need intensive care, has about one fifth of its nurses absent because of Covid, according to a senior nurse who requested anonymity because of a ban on speaking to the media.  New South Wales may soon record as many as 100,000 new Covid cases a day as people taking rapid antigen tests report their positive results. Even though the Omicron variant is less virulent than the Delta strain, the explosion in cases means even if a small proportion get very ill that number threatens to overwhelm the hospital system. Unlike in previous Covid waves, the hospital’s HDU is now housing Covid-positive patients even though it does not have specialised air treatment to filter out the virus. “We’ve got a few patients with literally no immune system,” the nurse said. “They can die if they got [Covid] pretty instantly.” Fresh figures from the Critical Intelligence Unit of the NSW health department show that as of 9 January the share of staffed ICU beds occupied by Covid patients across the whole state stood at 33%, up from 19.9% on 2 January. The average length of stay of admissions for the week ending 10 January was 4.5 days, up from 3.6 days for the previous week, the data shows. For those in ICU, the average stay was 4.7 days compared with six days a week earlier. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning As of 9 January, NSW had 4,941 healthcare workers in isolation, up from 2,457 on 3 January, the data shows. Senior medical staff were told on a conference call on Wednesday that Westmead, one of Sydney’s biggest hospitals, was now treating 350 Covid patients while the Royal Prince Alfred hospital had 150, a senior doctor told Guardian Australia. The strains on the state’s health system were “dire”, the doctor said, adding that staff were again told not to speak to the media. “We’re pretty much at full capacity,” the senior nurse said. “From what I understand, our ICU is basically completely full.” Staff with Covid at the nurse’s hospital who had previously been required to isolate for 14 days, with tests every three days, had now been reduced to seven days’ isolation. The nurse said the halving of isolation was “absolutely ridiculous” because some people can still be “quite infectious by day seven”. “In the workplace environment, the moment you remove your gown … before you put on another one, you will still be touching other equipment,” the nurse said. “So imagine that this particular person who got asked to come back to work as Covid positive, who happened to spread it to everyone in the workplace … the whole HDU will crumble.” Having Covid patients in the HDU was also complicating the work because of the onerous wearing of “hazmat” level personal protective equipment. A patient needing resuscitation would typically require a team of eight staff in normal times. Such work was now being done by two to three staff. “Basically, one of them is responsible for compression, one for airways and other one medication, and all the others they have to stay outside” to give advice to a crew “already under a lot of stress”, the nurse said. Normally the HDU would have a minimum of one nurse per three patients. That ratio had now risen to one to five on occasions, and may reach six or seven. Such a level would be “very, very dangerous”, the nurse said. “It defeats the whole purpose of having more close and more intensive monitoring and observation.” Staff had been told to minimise their exposure to the virus by wearing masks, maintaining social distance and washing hands, the nurse said. “But you were in a hospital situation. You can’t maintain social distance when you’re in a place like giving an injection to a patient,” the nurse said. “It’s not a dart. Just you know, stand outside the door and grab the patient’s arm, it doesn’t work like that.” The dearth of rapid antigen tests had also affected the hospital, the nurse said. Staff were supposed to test every second day, but could not get access to a test even at the hospital. “In my particular HDU, we haven’t have received any RAT tests at all,” the nurse said. “Staff members were literally asked to go buy the RAT test or order some from some other units.” NSW Health has been contacted for comment.

1/13/2022,"A man has been arrested after allegedly damaging a statue outside the BBC’s Broadcasting House on Wednesday. Officers were called to reports of a man scaling the building in Portland Place, central London, and using a chisel to damage the statue in question.  Police attended and arrested the man on suspicion of criminal damage after he was helped down by London fire brigade at 8.45pm. The man accused of damaging the statue was taken into custody after being checked over by medics. A police spokesperson said: “Police were called at approximately 4.15pm on Wednesday, 12 January, to reports of a man damaging a statue on a ledge outside a building in Portland Place, W1. Officers attended. “The man came down with assistance from London fire brigade at around 8.45pm. He was checked by London ambulance service before being arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and taken into custody. “The property owners are examining any damage to the statue and building.” Another man was also arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and remains in custody. The carving, which depicts Prospero and a part-naked Ariel from Shakespeare’s The Tempest, was installed by the artist on the front of the BBC’s Broadcasting House headquarters in London in 1933, shortly after the building opened. The sculptor, Eric Gill, was one of the most prominent early 20th-century British artists and designers until his death in 1940.
