4/15/2022,"(Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Moscow would work to redirect its energy exports eastward as Europe tries to reduce its reliance on them, adding that European nations would not be able to ditch Russian gas immediately. Russia supplies around 40% of the EU's natural gas, and western sanctions over what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine have hit its energy exports by complicating the financing and logistics of existing deals. While the EU debates whether to slap sanctions on Russian gas and oil and member states seek supplies from elsewhere, the Kremlin has been forging closer ties with China, the world's top energy consumer, and other Asian countries. ""The so-called partners from unfriendly countries concede themselves that they won't be able to make do without Russian energy resources, including without natural gas, for example,"" Putin told a televised government meeting. ""There is no rational replacement (for Russian gas) in Europe now."" Putin also said that Europe, by talking about cutting off energy supplies from Russia, was driving up prices and destabilising the market. He said Russia, which accounts for around a tenth of global oil production and around a fifth of gas, would need new infrastructure to boost energy supplies to Asia. He ordered the government to present a plan by June 1 including on ""expanding transport infrastructure to countries of Africa, Latin America (and the) Asia Pacific."" He also sought clarity on the possibility of including two pipelines - China-bound Power of Siberia and the far-eastern Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok in Russian unified system of gas supplies. Plugging those routes into the wider network may allow Russia, in theory, to switch gas flows from Europe to Asia and visa versa. Russia launched pipeline gas supplies to China in the end of 2019 and in February agreed a 30-year contract via a new pipeline, yet to be built, with plans to settle sales in euros. Putin also said that the role of national currencies in exporting deals should rise, amid Russia's plans to switch to roubles in payments for its gas supplies, mainly to Europe. Russia has seen a steep decline in production of oil, its key source of revenues, amid difficulties with payments for trading and vessels. Major global trading houses are planning to reduce crude and fuel purchases from Russia's state-controlled oil companies as early as May 15, sources said, to avoid falling foul of EU sanctions on Russia. Putin said the sector's most acute problems were related to the disruption of energy supply logistics.

4/15/2022,"Most Americans have less in their retirement accounts than they’d like, and much less than the rules say they should have. So, obviously, if that describes you then you’re not alone. Now, most financial advisors recommend that you have between five and six times your annual income in a 401(k) account or other retirement savings account by age 50. With continued growth over the rest of your working career, this amount should generally let you have enough in savings to retire comfortably by age 65. Consider working with a financial advisor as you flesh out your retirement plan. What Your Retirement Savings Should Look Like by Age 50 Financial experts sometimes suggest planning for your retirement income to be about 80% of your pre-retirement income. So, for example, someone who earned $100,000 per year going into retirement would plan on having about $80,000 per year while retired. The reason for this discrepancy is that most households tend to have fewer needs and responsibilities while in retirement, and therefore fewer expenses. The only major exception to this rule is when it comes to healthcare. You should expect those costs to rise in your later years. To make your savings last, financial experts recommend that you plan on withdrawing about 4% per year from your retirement fund. This will depend on three main factors: How much money you have in your retirement fund The average rate of return that your retirement fund generates Your anticipated Social Security income So, for example, say you plan on needing $80,000 per year in retirement. First, you should look up how much money you can expect each month from Social Security. This income will depend on how much you made during your working life, as well as when you choose to retire. If you are an average Social Security recipient it will come to approximately $1,650 a month, or $19,800 a year. So you should plan on withdrawing an additional $60,200 per year to make up the difference. Applying the 4% rule of thumb, $60,200/0.04, suggests that this household will want about $1.5 million in their retirement fund. Other, more conservative, recommendations suggest making these plans without accounting for Social Security. In that case, you would want about $2 million in your retirement fund.

Sign up today. The 4% rule may entail withdrawing too much. It comes from, in part, conservative estimates of your retirement fund’s returns. By the time you retire you should have shifted your portfolio to safe assets. Many retirement funds, with comparatively safe assets, will have a return rate of around 3% to 5% by this point, allowing you to hover right around the replacement rate for your withdrawals. So someone who earns $100,000 per year will want to have around $1.5 million in their retirement fund by age 65. At age 50, then, many experts suggest that this retiree would need to have – at a bare minimum – around $600,000 up in a 401(k), or other tax-advantaged account. That would give the retiree 15 years to boost their retirement nest egg by an additional $900,000, or grow by an average of $60,000 annually for each of the next 15 years. That is unlikely to happen without significant capital appreciation in the retiree’s tax-advantaged account. Many advisors recommend seeking a rate of return around 7% to 8% to reach the needed $1.5 million. Reaching the Retirement Finish Line Besides making sure that the asset allocation of your retirement fund is sufficiently aggressive, there are at least four other steps you can take to get from $600,000 at 50 to $1.5 million at 65. Max Out Your Catch-Up Contributions This is the most important thing you can do. The IRS limits how much you can contribute to 401(k), individual retirement account (IRA) and Roth IRA in a single year. After you turn 50 it raises the cap, allowing you to make what are called “catch up contributions.” In 2022, for example, most workers can only contribute up to $20,500 to their 401(k) account. However, anyone age 50 or older can contribute up to $27,000. That extra $6,500 is significant, and between age 50 and age 65 it has time to add up to something very real. Take advantage of it. Open Simultaneous Retirement Funds The IRS allows you to contribute to a 401(k), an IRA and a Roth IRA in the same year. However, there is overlap between the contribution limits for an IRA and a Roth IRA. If you are already maximizing your contribution limits to your 401(k) but are still concerned that it isn’t enough, consider opening an IRA or a Roth IRA to supplement your savings. Doing so will allow you to put money into multiple retirement accounts at the same time, helping you to boost your savings considerably. If you already have simultaneous retirement accounts, consider simply opening an earmarked account. Even though it won’t see the same tax advantages, there’s no reason that you can’t save for retirement with an ordinary investment portfolio. You can put as much money into it as you like then just plan on leaving it there for retirement. Manage Debt, Manage Spending An excellent way to free up some cash is to stop making interest payments on debt. If you have existing debt, paying it off more quickly will reduce the amount that you spend on interest and fees. This will, in turn, give you more cash to dedicate toward your retirement account. When it comes to long-term debt, like a mortgage, paying it off more aggressively can also reduce your potential expenses in retirement. You won’t have to make those payments, which can reduce the amount of money you’ll need each month once you’ve stopped working. At the same time, consider your overall lifestyle. If you think you may not have enough for your retirement, are there ways that you can shift your lifestyle over the long run that will reduce expenses? Is there someplace less expensive you could live, for example? This isn’t as simple as skipping your morning latte. Instead, consider whether you can shift your monthly needs in a way that might significantly change your budget both today and in retirement. Consider Working More and Retiring Later If you don’t have enough money to fund additional retirement accounts, consider taking on additional work to earn that money. This can range from freelance or gig work to a formal part-time job. This is not a recommendation we make lightly. By the time you’re in your 50s, the last thing most people will want to do is “hustle.” However, secondary work is a good way to boost your finances, and if you need the money for retirement then it has to come from somewhere. More importantly, while it would be unpleasant to need a second job at 55, it would be far worse to need a job at 75. Working today might help ensure that you don’t have to do so tomorrow. The jump in Social Security payments from normal retirement age to 70 is significant. If you were born between 1943 and 1954, If you start receiving benefits at age 66 you get 100% of your monthly benefit. Should you start receiving retirement benefits at age 67, you’ll get 108% of the monthly benefit because you delayed getting benefits for 12 months. If you start receiving retirement benefits at age 70, you’ll get 132% of the monthly benefit because you delayed getting benefits for 48 months. Bottom Line Most financial experts suggest that retirees should have around five to six times their annual income saved up in their retirement account by age 50. If you haven’t hit that mark, it’s probably a good time to maximize catchup contributions and consider opening one or more additional retirement accounts. In addition, make sure your investments are poised for capital appreciation, which of course entails more risk, and cut your discretionary spending.

4/15/2022,"Elon Musk offered to buy Twitter (TWTR) for $54.20 per share in a filing made public Thursday, calling it his ""best and final offer."" But the Tesla (TSLA) CEO will have to reconsider that offer if he’s serious about taking over the social media company, according to one analyst. “No one believes this is the final price. No board in America is going to take that number,” said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill. Twitter shares jumped 4% on news of the all-cash offer, before falling in the afternoon session Thursday. In the amended SEC filing, Musk wrote his offer to pay $54.20 per share amounted to a 54% premium on the stock, compared to its price the day before Musk began investing in the company. But in comments at TED2022 Musk cast doubt on his plan to take Twitter private, saying, “I’m not sure I will actually be able to acquire it.” “The intent is to retain as many shareholders as is allowed by the law in a private company,” he said. “So, it's definitely not from the standpoint of let me figure out how to monopolize or maximize my ownership of Twitter.” Musk added that his move was not about finding a way ""to make money."" “I don’t care about the economics at all,” he said. Regardless of Musks’ motives, Thill said his offer simply doesn’t add up for Twitter’s board, in part because the billionaire hasn’t laid out how he plans to ""transform"" the company. Thill also alluded to Musk’s use of the number “420,” a popular reference to marijuana, as ""borderline unprofessional."" “It's not going to be anything with a 420, OK, so take that out. Bring the bid to $60 and then put together a constructive structure around how they would run it,” Thill said. “Then maybe, maybe, but that's what it’s going to take.” Twitter publicly acknowledged the takeover offer Thursday, saying in a statement that it plans to “carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the Company and all Twitter stockholders.” But behind the scenes, the board reportedly views the offer as ""unwelcome,"" suggesting it is willing to put up a fight, according to The Information. The potential battle comes just five months after new CEO Parag Agrawal assumed leadership from Twitter Co-founder Jack Dorsey last fall. Thill said Musk’s offer could open the door to other bidders interested in the social media company, although Washington’s increased antitrust scrutiny on big tech firms will likely prevent any deal from getting done. “It's hard because the government is going to say no to any large transaction even if the rest of tech wanted to do this,” Thill said. “It’s hard to see who the next logical player will be.” Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

4/15/2022,"Despite the vast depth of information and education available today, financial literacy isn't improving among adults in the U.S. A financial advisor can help you improve your financial literacy to better understand your money. Find a fiduciary advisor today. On average, American adults correctly answered only 50% of the questions in the 2022 Personal Finance Index, an annual survey conducted by the TIAA Institute and the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center (GFLEC) at the George Washington University School of Business. Since researchers from the TIAA and George Washington University started gauging financial literacy among adults in 2017, functional knowledge hasn't improved. The area where people struggle the most? Understanding financial risk. Here's a look at the survey's findings and some of the questions that were asked. Financial Literacy Isn't Improving Unfortunately, this year's survey and previous studies have revealed that many adults in the U.S. function with a poor understanding of financial topics. On average, U.S. adults answered only 50% of the index questions correctly in 2022, a figure that has remained steady since 2017. While only 18% of respondents could correctly answer between 76% and 100% of the 28 questions that were posed in this year's survey, nearly a quarter of adults (23%) incorrectly answered at least 75% of questions. What's worse, the percentage of adults with poor financial literacy is on the rise. In 2020, only 17% of respondents got three-quarters of the questions wrong. Assessing financial risk is the one area where functional knowledge is consistently lowest among U.S. adults, the survey found. Only 36% of questions related to risk were answered correctly, a 3% drop from the first survey in 2017. ""Comprehending risk involves, for example, understanding that the expected outcome in a given scenario depends on the range of possible outcomes, the financial implication associated with each outcome and the likelihood of each outcome occurring,"" according to the study. Which financial topic are American adults most knowledgeable about? Borrowing money. On average, 60% of questions related to borrowing were answered correctly, followed by questions focusing on saving (53%) and consuming (52%), the survey found. Can You Answer These Questions Correctly? TIAA shared with SmartAsset a sampling of the questions that respondents were asked as part of the 2022 survey. The questions touch on financial risk, as well as how interest accrues on savings and how it impacts a loan balance. Here are three questions that were part of the 2022 survey: There's a 50/50 chance that Malik's car will need engine repairs within the next six months which would cost $1,000. At the same time there is a 10% chance that he will need to replace the air conditioning unit in his house, which would cost $4,000. Which poses the greater financial risk for Malik? Anna saves $500 each year for 10 years and then stops saving additional money. At the same time, Charlie saves nothing for 10 years but then receives a $5,000 gift, which he decides to save. If both Anna and Charlie earn a 5% return each year, who will have more money in savings after 20 years? Jose owes $1,000 on a loan that has an interest rate of 20% per year compounded annually. If he makes no payments on the loan, at this interest rate, how many years will it take for the amount he owes to double? (Possible answers: less than 5 years; 5 to 10 years; More than 10 years; Don't know) Answers: 1.Despite the air conditioning repair potentially costing Malik $4,000, the likelihood of a $1,000 car repair is far greater, meaning it poses a more significant financial risk. 2. Anna would have more money after 20 years than Charlie, considering her savings would have a 10-year head start to accumulate interest. 3. If your answer to the third question was ""less than 5 years,"" you would have been among the respondents who answered it correctly. Without making payments on his car loan, Jose's loan balance would double within four years. Why Financial Literacy Matters The TIAA-GFLEC points to a direct correlation between financial literacy and financial well-being. The more knowledge adults have about the money, the better off they are. The survey found those with low levels of financial literacy are six times more likely to have difficulty making ends meet compared to adults with high levels of financial literacy. They're also five times as likely to lack enough emergency savings to cover one month of expenses and three times more likely to be unable to withstand a $2,000 financial shock. ""It is evident again that greater financial literacy tends to translate into higher financial well-being and lower financial literacy is generally associated with lower financial well-being,"" the study's authors concluded. Meanwhile, a separate study calculated how much a lack of financial literacy could actually be costing someone. At the end of 2021, the National Financial Educators Council (NFEC) conducted a survey among 3,389 adults and found that the average adult loses about $1,389 annually due to a lack of financial knowledge, including personal finance and investments. Bottom Line Unfortunately, financial literacy isn't improving among American adults. On average, respondents to the 2022 TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index correctly answered only half of the questions, a troubling figure that has hasn't improved since the survey's first year in 2017. Comprehending financial risk is the one area where adults need the most improvement, as only 36% of questions related to risk were answered correctly in 2022.

4/15/2022,"Cryptocurrency has divided the celebrity ranks into two camps: Boosters and skeptics. Gwyneth Paltrow, Snoop Dogg, and Justin Bieber — all have joined the growing camp of crypto supporters. But digital assets also have their detractors, including former ""The O.C."" star Ben McKenzie, who's co-authoring a book on the risks posed by cryptocurrency. Best-selling author Michael Lewis, whose 16 books include deeply reported chronicles of the thrills and flaws of Wall Street, appears to fall in between the two camps. In a new interview, Lewis cautioned that the value of cryptocurrency may dramatically plummet and its wide adoption could threaten traditional capital markets. But he also lauded crypto innovations that he says could establish fairness between traders. ""The whole thing may come crashing down,"" says Lewis, whose podcast ""Against the Rules"" recently returned for its third season. ""Crypto is an act of faith — like gold, like the dollar."" ""It's hard to judge — impossible to judge — whether that faith is sustainable or not,"" he adds. ""But the longer it goes on, the more of a threat it poses to the existing financial order."" While the major stock indexes have suffered losses so far this year, the widely held cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) have seen sharper declines. Bitcoin has dropped 16% so far this year, and Ethereum has fallen 21%, as of early Wednesday morning. But proponents of cryptocurrency say volatility is to be expected for a relatively new asset class, often noting that regulatory uncertainty helps foster market swings. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last week called for regulation of cryptocurrency in a comprehensive speech, saying government intervention would monitor the rapid spread of digital assets and prevent illicit uses. The remarks came just weeks after President Joe Biden signed an executive order on cryptocurrency in March. Many top players in crypto praised the Biden administration for the move. Lewis, whose 2014 book heightened criticism over the lucrative use of high frequency trading on Wall Street, said cryptocurrency markets could improve upon equity markets in their removal of brokers who otherwise provide an advantage for some traders. Cryptocurrency ""eliminates middlemen,"" Lewis says. ""If you are trading on a cryptocurrency exchange, you have an account with the exchange; you don't account with a broker who's moving your stuff in and out of the exchange."" ""There are not high frequency traders who are paying the cryptocurrency exchange for faster information about the exchange,"" he adds. ""The whole jerry-rigging of the stock market isn't happening here.""
