2/12/2022,"Ghislaine Maxwell’s lawyers cannot keep sealed their detailed legal arguments about a juror in her trial who might not have disclosed childhood sex abuse during jury selection, a judicial decision issued Friday said. Judge Alison Nathan wrote: “[The] defendant’s motion to temporarily seal, in their entirety, all documents related to the motion for a new trial, is denied.”  This ruling stems from Maxwell’s filing of detailed arguments for a new trial, relating to this juror, under seal. Maxwell was found guilty on 29 December of sex trafficking and associated counts for facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of girls, some as young as 14. Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender, was apprehended in July 2019 for sex trafficking minor teens. Epstein killed himself approximately one month later in a New York City jail while awaiting trial. The arguments on sealing documents stem from controversy about Juror 50, who has been identified as Scotty David. After Maxwell’s trial, David gave interviews where he claimed to have been sexually abused as a child. Maxwell’s lawyers claimed that filing their defense documents publicly, before Nathan makes a decision about a hearing or retrial, “will provide a roadmap of the defense’s examination of Juror 50 and will allow him to plan out and tailor his responses, or even potentially spoliate evidence, to paint himself and his conduct in the best light possible”. David publicly said that he told other panelists about this sexual abuse during deliberations, allowing them to understand circumstances from a victim’s perspective. David’s statements about alleged abuse spurred questions because potential jurors filed out questionnaires as part of the selection process. These questionnaires inquired about sexual abuse. David reportedly said that he did not remember a question on abuse but said he had answered every question truthfully. In the wake of David’s statements, prosecutors asked Nathan to investigate his comments. Maxwell’s lawyers promptly asked for a hearing and new trial. In issuing her decision about sealing, Nathan said: “The court is unpersuaded by the defendant’s concern that media interest in the motion warrants temporary sealing of the documents in their entirety.” Nathan said that both sides must propose “narrowly tailored” redactions. It is unclear when these redacted documents will be made public.",News/US news,"Ghislaine Maxwell lawyers cannot keep retrial arguments under seal, judge rules ",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/11/ghislaine-maxwell-lawyers-motion-juror-retrial
2/12/2022,"Boris Johnson has been sent a questionnaire by Scotland Yard over alleged parties in Downing Street, in a move that could raise fresh concerns among Tory MPs about his leadership. No 10 confirmed late on Friday night that the prime minister received the document, and vowed he would respond to it “as required”.  About 50 people were asked to account for their presence at the dozen events under scrutiny by the police as part of their inquiry into Covid law breaches, named “Operation Hillman”. Johnson has continued to insist he broke no rules, but apologised for attending one gathering which was a “bring your own booze” garden party organised by his principal private secretary on 20 May 2020. He is also believed to have been present at a birthday celebration in No 10 on 19 June 2020 and leaving dos for aides in November that year, and January 2021. Police are also investigating a gathering in his personal flat in Downing Street. In a clear signal officers are investigating if the prime minister personally broke the law, a No 10 spokesperson said: “We can confirm the prime minister has received a questionnaire from the Metropolitan police. He will respond as required.” The move has the potential to spark fresh concerns among Tory MPs about Johnson’s future, though with parliament in recess, many will spend the next nine days back in their constituencies. Some backbenchers have held off calling for a ballot on his leadership until the outcome of the Met’s investigation, though suggested that they could submit a letter of no confidence if Johnson is found to have misled parliament or is fined for breaking the Covid rules he set. The Met declined to confirm the news that the prime minister had received the questionnaire nor whether those receiving them were being treated as potential suspects or witnesses. Earlier this week, Scotland Yard explained its approach and the role the questionnaire would play. It said the document “asks for an account and explanation of the recipient’s participation in an event” and “has formal legal status and must be answered truthfully”. The Met added: “Recipients are informed that responses are required within seven days. In most cases contact is being made via email. “It should be noted that being contacted does not mean a fixed penalty notice will necessarily be issued to that person. “Nevertheless, if following an investigation, officers believe it is appropriate because the Covid regulations have been breached without a reasonable excuse, a fixed penalty notice will normally be issued.” If police decide laws have been broken, then they will send the paperwork to the criminal records office, who will formally issue the fixed penalty notice. Cressida Dick, hours before she was forced out as the Met commissioner, said of those sent questionnaires: “Some, but probably not all, may very well end up with a fixed-penalty notice.” She added the scandal had “hugely disgusted many members of the public to see”.",News/Politics,PM sent Downing Street lockdown party questionnaire by Met police,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/11/pm-sent-downing-street-lockdown-party-questionnaire-by-met-police
2/12/2022,"Christian Eriksen knew there might be question marks in the minds of his new Brentford teammates so he decided to address them head on. He felt more than ready for his first training session on Monday but did not want it to feel different for anyone else, so the previous night he told Thomas Frank he had something to say. “There was a meeting before training and he said ‘welcome’ to me, and then I said a few words,” Eriksen said. “I said: ‘I’m here because everything has been cleared; if there are any questions you want to ask me, you can always ask me. Don’t go easy on me, because if there was any concern I wouldn’t be here.’ I told them that from the beginning.”  According to Eriksen, he was taken at his word. Nobody has held back over the past five days and that is exactly how he wants it. The trauma of his cardiac arrest last June during Denmark’s Euro 2020 match with Finland remains fresh in many minds and there is the knowledge, too, that Eriksen has been fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to alleviate the worst-case scenario of a recurrence. But Eriksen has not returned to the Premier League looking for favours and it was clear, in his formal unveiling as a Brentford player on Friday, that he does not see west London as a place to take life slowly. The aim is to reach his old levels and, in doing so, show that he is no special case. “I felt from the beginning of this that I need to prove you can play with an ICD, if something that bad has happened,” he said. “You can return to normal life afterwards. That is more motivation for me, to show I am capable of that. Of course, at the same time, I have not forgotten how to play football. My body is still the same and my vision and my ability will still be the same – that has not changed.” It is a mouthwatering prospect for an out-of-form Brentford, although Eriksen will not play against Crystal Palace on Saturday and the visit to Arsenal next weekend may also be too optimistic a target. “It was a long process to be where I am today, to get the full green light and really be convinced that I am able to play again,” he said. That has always been the intention, beyond early moments of dejection when he told ambulance workers and his partner, Sabrina: “Keep my boots, I won’t need them.” Eriksen quickly found himself itching to get back and it was striking to hear the range of emotions that swirled around his head, five days after the incident, as he watched his teammates play Belgium on a television in Copenhagen’s Rigshospitalet, which is within sight of the national stadium. It was a heady summer’s day in the Danish capital: it felt as if the entire country had come out for Eriksen. “It was tough, also because you’re in hospital 200 metres away from the stadium where you would have played if this hadn’t happened,” he said. “So there was a bit of sadness to be watching; at the same time you were annoyed because ‘why did it happen to me, why can’t I play because I feel normal? I feel good, why can’t I just go out now and play?’ It was a bit of a mix but it was tough to see, because I wanted to be there, I wanted to play that game. “Even the Finland game, watching in hospital, I wanted to play the last 30 minutes. But that was the weird feeling: that I hadn’t felt what happened, that I don’t feel anything bad has happened, I just know it has happened. That’s also why mentally I was in a good place really quickly, luckily. It’s also thanks to the doctors – they saved me quickly.” Eriksen has taken advice from Daley Blind, his former teammate in Ajax’s youth system, about playing with an ICD. Blind was fitted with the device in December 2019 after being diagnosed with heart muscle inflammation; the former Belgium Under-21 player Anthony van Loo also has an ICD and it was shown to work when, in 2009, it shocked his heart back into its normal rhythm after an arrhythmia episode during a match. “That’s what you have the ICD for, in case that happens,” Eriksen said. “Two players when I was younger had ICDs. I’ve never seen it in use, and it’s also something you don’t want to see, but you’re lucky that it’s there to help. But I spoke to Daley a lot of times about everything: the rehab, the feeling, what it feels like with and without it.” Eriksen has the option of playing with padding to protect his chest and tried that for the first time in Friday’s training session, although his instinct is that it will not be necessary. He feels ready for whatever is thrown at him – joking that, besides, “I don’t do tackles” – and hopes opponents go about their business with as few scruples as his Brentford colleagues. “I hope they treat me the same as everyone else because I am,” he said. “I will be the same, as I told everyone at Brentford on the first day. I think it will take a few games or less and people will see nothing has changed: they don’t need to be worried about me as a person or a player.” The clear aim is that the journey back picks up inexorable speed from here. “One of the first things I told my heart doctor at the time was that if I’m going to come back, my aim is I want to be fit before the World Cup,” he said. That is still nine months away, a few weeks longer than the time since Eriksen’s collapse caused such horror; the sight of him smiling for photos on Brentford’s pitch suggests no target is unreachable any more.",Sport/Football,Christian Eriksen urges Brentford teammates: ‘Don’t go easy on me’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/11/christian-eriksen-urges-brentford-teammates-dont-go-easy-on-me
2/12/2022,"Pep Guardiola believes it is inconceivable Jürgen Klopp has given up hope of catching Manchester City in the title race because the Liverpool manager is such a fierce competitor. City lead the Merseyside club by nine points having played a game more and Guardiola said his team may need 96 points to retain the title – a figure Liverpool could reach only by winning all their remaining matches. After Liverpool beat Leicester on Thursday Klopp played down his side’s chance of catching City. Guardiola was told – wrongly – that the German had said it was impossible to overhaul the leaders and was asked for his response.  “Just I don’t believe him,” Guardiola said. “Absolutely [it’s possible] and he thinks the same, otherwise he wouldn’t be the competitor that he is. Of course he believes. In football, everything can happen. He knows that he has to win a lot of games, like we know we have to win a lot of games to fight to be champion again. “Both teams have shown over the years that they can make an incredible run of victories in a row. Both have the same managers, more or less the same squads and ideas. Both could make 16, 17 wins in a row. They can do it – we can do it, too. “The opponents are [always] so tough. We have to win the next game, next game. That is why the Premier League is the nicest title, because you have to fight against an incredible amount of problems. It’s who is more consistent and these two teams are incredibly consistent. The run we’ve done over the last 14 games [winning 13, drawing one] and we are just potentially six points ahead – it’s because the opponent is so good too. In normal circumstances an opponent would be 10 or 12 points [behind] with the amount of games we’ve won.” City’s manager feels that his team’s greatest opponent is themselves. “We have to perform for ourselves as high as possible,” he said. “If the opponent is better we accept it. We face an opponent but this is not important – what’s important is ourselves.”",Sport/Football,Guardiola says Klöpp ‘absolutely’ believes Liverpool can still catch City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/11/guardiola-says-klopp-absolutely-believes-liverpool-can-still-catch-city
2/12/2022,"The Australian Capital Territory’s top prosecutor has issued a warning against “officers of the court and public figures” making public comment on active cases following the furore over prime minister Scott Morrison’s comments to Brittany Higgins. Morrison was forced to clarify comments to Higgins earlier in the week relating to her time in parliament.  The comments prompted a rebuke from Warwick Korn, the lawyer representing the man accused of her rape, Bruce Lehrmann, and other leading legal figures, who feared they could be prejudicial. Korn said the comments could reduce the chances of a fair jury trial, saying “the behaviour of our prime minister and others in this past 24 hours truly beggars belief”. Morrison’s office later said the prime minister was speaking generally and his comments were “by no means a reflection on the matters before a court”. The courts have long-held practices for dealing with pre-trial publicity, including through jury selection procedures and judicial directions. The ACT’s director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, has sought to allay fears about any potential impact of the publicity, telling Guardian Australia that the criminal justice system has “managed high-profile cases for as long as there has been media”. But he also cautioned against further public commentary on active cases, including “commentary about commentary”. “I strongly discourage all public commentary on active cases, including commentary about commentary, and particularly by officers of the court and public figures,” he said in a statement. Several high-profile barristers spoke out to condemn Morrison’s comments on Friday. The trial is expected to take place in June in the ACT supreme court. Lehrmann faces one charge of sexual intercourse without consent and is alleged to have raped Higgins in a parliamentary office in 2019. He has pleaded not guilty and the trial is expected to last three to four weeks. Judge-alone trials are no longer allowed for sexual assault cases in the ACT. Such matters must go before a jury.",News/Law,Brittany Higgins case: top prosecutor warns against ‘commentary’ after Scott Morrison’s remarks,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/12/brittany-higgins-case-top-prosecutor-warns-against-commentary-after-scott-morrisons-remarks
2/12/2022,"In fairness, they did warn us. Perhaps, on reflection, we should have listened to Jonas Eidevall and Emma Hayes when they urged us not to treat this game as a title decider. It was many things: taut, tense, turbulent, controversial, stressful in the extreme, particularly in the closing minutes when it felt as if the entire game could pivot on a single lucky bounce. In the end, though, nothing was decided and nothing was settled. Chelsea maintained their seven-match unbeaten run, their fate still in their own hands. Arsenal retained their two-point lead at the top of the Women’s Super League, and the knowledge that the hardest games of their season – Chelsea home and away, Manchester United home and away, Manchester City home and away, Tottenham away – are now behind them. The most open WSL in years still feels as if it will go down to the wire.  For all this, it was probably Arsenal who departed the happier of the two sides. Arguably it was they who had more to prove here. Results had been poor. Performances had been even worse. And on a broader level they were fighting an entropy and self-doubt that seems to have set in ever since their three heavy defeats in the Champions League. It is, in effect, the same entropy the men’s team have been fighting for 15 years: a sensation that the elite are pulling clear, that the future lies elsewhere, that their best player is about to move to Barcelona for nothing. It was in this context that Eidevall made the decision that may well define the rest of Arsenal’s season. Vivianne Miedema, the all-time top scorer in WSL history, started in midfield, with new signing Stina Blackstenius leading the line. It was not even, as many on social media suggested, a pure No 10 role. Although Miedema often played just behind Blackstenius, at other times she was the deepest Arsenal midfielder on the pitch, given the licence to go pretty much where she wanted to get the ball and build attacks. There are two ways of looking at this, really. On a tactical level, it made plenty of sense. For all her goalscoring achievements in the English game, Miedema has always been at least as good at creating and linking moves as finishing them. It follows, then, that if you want your most technically gifted player to see more of the ball, it makes sense to move her nearer the centre of the pitch. Miedema has often liked to drop into midfield anyway. Why not formalise the arrangement? And for about 40 minutes, Miedema pulled the strings delightfully. She popped up on the right to clip a cute little cross to the near post. She won the ball high up the pitch. She played a lovely through-ball to Beth Mead, delaying the pass for just long enough to wrong-foot the Chelsea defence. She hit the post herself from a knock-down. She was noticeably, and by some distance, the best Arsenal player on the pitch. But as Chelsea began to come into the game towards the end of the first half and at the start of the second, we also glimpsed the plan’s limitations. Whether as a lone forward or false No 9, Miedema has never really been the sort of player who grabs a match by the lapels and dominates it. A big part of her game is opportunism and disappearance. She stays off the radar just long enough for defenders to drop their guard for a split second. And when you are as sharp as Miedema, a split second is often all you need. The problem comes when your job is not simply to run up the score but to define the team around you. As Arsenal began to retreat in the second half, as Sophie Ingle started to mark her more tightly, you could occasionally see Miedema’s team-mates looking to her for inspiration, for an outlet. Miedema herself was still finding little pockets of space, making clever runs, barely putting a foot wrong. But at a time when Arsenal were craving presence in the middle of the pitch, it felt like a misalignment. On balance, there was enough here for Arsenal fans to feel quietly encouraged. Blackstenius had a quiet night here, but will thrive against weaker opposition; the partnership with Miedema deserves time to gel and flourish. The great unknown, of course, is whether Arsenal are building a vision of the future or an expedient for the present; whether they are grooming Miedema’s partner-in-crime, or her eventual replacement.",Sport/Football,Miedema pulls strings from midfield before Chelsea pull out the scissors | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/11/miedema-pulls-strings-from-midfield-before-chelsea-pull-out-the-scissors
2/12/2022,"The Russian State Ballet of Siberia may be based 3,500 miles away, but you could say it does more to promote ballet in the UK than many of our own companies. This is its 18th UK tour, zigzagging across the country with a small troupe of dancers, a live orchestra and a bagful of classical ballets, mostly the obvious (Swan Lake, Nutcracker etc) and one lesser known story, The Snow Maiden. Not to be confused with The Snow Queen, it’s the Russian folk tale of a magical snow maiden who wishes to live and love among people, but when given the capacity for human emotions, she melts under the sun. There’s plenty of potential for a ballerina to explore the limpid fragility of her icy form and emotional transformation, but Natalia Bobrova in the title role remains pleasantly impassive throughout (her dancing is perfectly nice).  Georgy Bolsunovsky puts in the most dramatic effort as cocky merchant Mizgir, an entitled cad who picks a wife out of a lineup of villagers but then drops her for the supernatural snow girl (shades of La Sylphide). When all goes awry, he finds angst and gusto in his grand allegro. And as his poor ex, Elena Svinko manages some elegant sadness alongside her lovely long lines. The choreography by artistic director Sergei Bobrov and Mark Peretokin is unspectacular, although it has some nice lifts. There’s a general lack of brio – even on a small stage you can dance with energy and joy – and the tragedy is slight. They’re hindered by the score, made of incidental music Tchaikovsky wrote for a play of the same title (plus some other choice extracts); it’s missing the composer’s magnificent melodies and the magical affinity between music and steps. In the first act especially the sound is sometimes turgid, very much the mood of an orchestra midway through an 84-date tour. But the fact is, it’s an 84-date UK tour. You’re never going to get the Bolshoi doing that, or the Royal Ballet. At under two hours, Bobrov and co keep things tight, with nice costumes and snowy CGI backdrop. If you take it for what it is, this is a perfectly serviceable evening at the ballet.
