2/19/2022,"Soaring gas prices have been making headlines but for some households heating bills are nowhere near reaching record highs. These are the residents of Passivhaus homes. There are 1,500 Passivhaus buildings in the UK – and they have never been more popular. Each one is built – or retrofitted – to an internationally recognised “energy and comfort standard”, which typically involves very high levels of insulation, triple-glazed windows and an airtight, draught-free structure.  “It’s a way of ensuring that your building or home is very energy efficient, by reducing the energy demand – particularly for heating – down to very low levels while, at the same time, making sure the building is comfortable inside and has high levels of good indoor air quality,” says Jon Bootland, the chief executive of the Passivhaus Trust. The trust is a non-profit organisation that supervises the awarding of the Passivhaus standard in the UK. Bootland says over the past 18 months the number of Passivhaus projects in the pipeline has soared. “At the last count, there were over 7,000 homes in development – some only at the planning stage, others in construction and nearly complete.” Membership of the trust has also doubled, from around 250 members in August 2020 to 500 today, suggesting there are now twice as many companies providing specialist design and construction services. To qualify as a Passivhaus in the UK, a building must meet the standards required by the trust and undergo a strict compliance process with an expert consultant who is an accredited certifier. “The certifier supervises the process from the beginning,” Bootland says. “They check the drawings, they check what’s built on site and they check the end result – and then that gets certified, at that point.” It is much more rigorous than the typical building regulations inspections that always occur during the construction of a house, he says. The owners receive a certificate and a plaque, which they can incorporate into the building. Although there are no official statistics, Bootland says that based on anecdotal evidence, he would expect a Passivhaus to sell for between 5% and 10% more than a similar property built to normal energy efficiency standards. Because of the desirability of these homes, Bootland warns anyone looking to buy a Passivhaus to be wary of unclear marketing claims. “A lot of people will say a house has ‘Passivhaus principles’, which actually has no meaning really.” A true Passivhaus will always have a certificate to prove its status and your solicitor should be sent the paperwork during the conveyancing process. Interest in Passivhaus buildings exploded, Bootland says, when local authorities started declaring climate emergencies and setting targets to become carbon neutral – or net zero – in their activities. “If you’re trying to deliver net zero, new-build social housing, one of the best ways to do that is to build a Passivhaus and then have some renewable energy provision locally, possibly on the site.” If the energy demand of a home is small, then you only need to invest in a small amount of renewables in order to balance that usage out. Last year, Camden council in London won an award for its Agar Grove development. Consisting of 216 council homes it is the largest Passivhaus scheme in the country and the council says residents have seen a reduction in their energy bills of up to 70% over their old homes. Flora Irani, 60, recently moved into one of the council homes with her husband and three children. “I love it,” she says. “It is a two-storey, four-bedroom house but we have just two radiators – one downstairs and one upstairs. And we never feel cold. It is amazing.” She has been a social-housing tenant for 15 years and used to pay £100 a week for gas and electricity but never felt warm enough. Now, she doesn’t pay anything for gas, as heating and hot water are incorporated into her rent, and pays £70 a month for her electricity. “My rent has gone up a little bit – not much – but it’s worth it,” she says. Unfortunately, inflation and the increased cost of living means spending the money she has saved on her energy bills now goes on essentials such as food. “It’s very helpful but it’s not money for saving or doing something fun with because everything else is more expensive.” As awareness of the climate emergency has grown, Passivhaus designs have become more popular with self-builders. Juraj Mikurcik built Old Holloway cottage, a three-bedroom, single-storey property in rural Herefordshire, for £135,000 in 2017 – and hasn’t had to pay a gas bill since. “We don’t have any central heating, just two towel rails in the bathrooms and a wood burning stove,” he says. Yet even in the depths of winter, his home always feels perfectly comfortable, he says. “It’s this fairly constant temperature. It doesn’t matter if it’s winter or summer, it’s very even.” He uses electricity and an air source heat pump to heat his water. In total, his electricity bills come to £65 a month and he gathers firewood to heat his stove. But he rarely needs to light it – only nine times so far this winter. “Even during the ‘beast from the east’, when we had a foot of snow on the roof, we only put the wood burner on for maybe a couple of hours a day. And we were fine,” he says. It is a far cry from the winters he and his wife used to experience in their previous home, an old stone cottage. “We used to spend £1,500 a year on heating oil just to keep barely comfortable, and another £500 on electricity,” he says. As an architect, who works for Architype, a firm that specialises in sustainable architecture, he had always dreamed of building his own Passivhaus but had only £50,000 in savings. He and his wife bought a plot of land with planning permission for £100,000, putting down a £20,000 deposit and borrowing £80,000 from Ecology building society. They used the remaining £30,000 of their savings to start the build and took out a self-build mortgage – again from Ecology – to fund the rest of the construction costs. The society currently offers builders of Passivhaus homes a discount of 1.25% off its standard rate. In total, the build cost £135,000 but Mikurcik thinks he saved at least £50,000 by managing the project and doing some of the work himself. The 100 sq metres property is now estimated to be worth just under £400,000. “We’ve got used to high levels of comfort, so going away on holidays or staying with friends at certain times of year can be a bit of a shock to the system,” Mikurcik says. “It can be quite surprising to go into a normal house and feel cold spots and draughts.” These homes are typically about 4% to 8% more expensive to build than a normal home, according to the Passivhaus Trust. This is partly because of the stringent quality assurance process builders must undergo, and partly because you are likely to spend more on insulation, ventilation and glazing. A Passivhaus is also likely to be more time-consuming and difficult to build than a normal home – but “only a tiny bit more”, Bootland says. “The building materials aren’t any more difficult, they can be the same as for other buildings. It’s the attention to detail, in terms of getting the design right, and the fact that the quality control on site is more rigorous.” He recommends using builders and architects who are on their fourth or fifth Passivhaus project. “They’ve already been through the learning curve and worked out what works and what doesn’t.” With the right budget, it is possible to turn an existing property into a Passivhaus via a process known as retrofitting. Harry Paticas, an architect for Arboreal Architecture and the founder of Retrofit Action For Tomorrow, is currently retrofitting his 1978 mid-terrace home in London. So far, he has spent about £100,000 and cut his energy bills from £1,500 to £600 a year. “The most noticeable impacts were the loft insulation and windows. That is because they were installed in one go, so we could feel the immediate impact before and after,” he says. He estimates that he has added at least £100,000 of value to the property. This is partly because he has converted a garage, which has had the added benefit of making his home more thermally efficient while increasing the size of his living space. The house is also much quieter inside, thanks to the triple-glazed windows, and the roof is now watertight. “It’s so much warmer in the winter and so much cooler in the summer. And that, I think, is really worth a lot,” he says. Anyone thinking of retrofitting their existing home should ask a Passivhaus consultant to go through their property and develop a staged plan with them before they undertake any work. This consultation can range in cost from a few hundred pounds to a few thousand pounds, depending on where you live in the country and who you hire, but it is particularly important if you live in a period property, a listed home or a conservation area. “If you’re living in a period property, I would highly recommend getting a very experienced person to help you because of the potential risks,” Bootland says. “In some cases, going to the full Passivhaus retrofit standard might not be the best answer because of the amount of work needed and the effects on the fabric of the building or restrictions such as conservation area rules.” In Victorian terraces, for example, walls are breathable and absorb moisture. “If you put insulation on them in the wrong place, or use the wrong kind of insulation, then you can trap the moisture and it can damage the fabric of the building, particularly if you’ve got timber joists,” he says. You may still be able to improve the insulation, “but it might not be financially viable or appropriate to take a building like that to the full Passivhaus retrofit standard. So definitely get expert advice. Don’t try to do it yourself.” If you are buying or building a Passivhaus, you may be able to fund it with a green mortgage. These mortgages reward you for owning an energy efficient home, typically by offering you discounts or cashback. Ecology building society, for example, offers owners of these homes a discount of up to 1.25% off its standard rate, and will lend on retrofit costs or for self-build, or to help you buy a new Passivhaus. The discounted rates on offer range from 2.4% to 2.9%, depending on what you are buying and whether you are renovating or building the property. Nationwide building society offers up to £500 cashback to borrowers buying an energy efficient home, while Halifax offers £250. You can also get up to £500 cashback from Halifax or Lloyds Bank when you make one of several eligible “green living” improvements to your home, such as insulating it or installing triple-glazed windows. If you install a ground or air source heat pump, you may qualify for up to £1,000 cashback.",Lifestyle/Money,Passivhaus: how to insulate your home against soaring heating bills,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/19/passivhaus-how-to-insulate-your-home-against-soaring-heating-bills
2/19/2022,"It was April 2020, the sixth week of home schooling, and eight-year-old Lara was fed up. Her father, photographer Helge Skodvin, along with his wife and two elder daughters, was stuck inside with Lara at home in Norway. The first wave of Covid had closed schools across the country, so at 9am every day, each of Skodvin’s daughters took a room in the house to join online classes; his youngest was supposed to be in the kitchen. Instead, Skodvin found Lara hiding under her bed, refusing to go back to her screen, table and lesson. He is pretty sure it was maths she ran away from.  “I was walking past her bedroom and spotted her legs sticking out. I had my phone in my hand, so I just snapped the scene,” Skodvin says. “I loved the colours, the chaos, the authenticity, and there was beautiful spring light coming in through the window. There was no need for my work camera, or even any edits.” After a few minutes, Lara went back to the kitchen, and returned to school a few days later. Soon afterwards, her sisters followed suit, much to the relief of their exhausted parents. In the months that followed, the image was included in two books about lockdown, and in one of Skodvin’s exhibitions. Lara, now almost 10, loves the photo. In fact, she considers herself something of a celebrity.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘I was walking past her bedroom and spotted her legs sticking out’: Helge Skodvin’s best phone picture,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/19/chaos-authenticity-helge-skodvins-best-phone-picture
2/19/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of people are still without power following Storm Eunice. A cleanup is set to begin after the storm brought damage, disruption and record-breaking gusts of wind to the UK and Ireland, leading to the deaths of at least four people.  The Met Office said a wind speed of up to 122mph was recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight on Friday, provisionally the highest ever in England, and described the storm as the worst since the Burns’ Day storm 32 years ago in which 47 people died. About 435,000 homes were left without power early on Friday evening. Hundreds of train services and flights were cancelled, and major roads closed. Millions of people were urged to stay at home due to safety fears over the impact of Eunice, while transport woes meant many were unable to travel. National Rail said “routes across most of Great Britain” remain affected on Saturday morning, with disruption set to continue throughout the day. “Do not travel” notices have been reissued for a number of services, including for the Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern networks, where some routes are not expected to reopen until the afternoon. South Western Railway expects significant disruption across their network in the morning, while Great Western Railway and Greater Anglia services are suspended until approximately 10am. Train networks were disrupted by flying debris, while there was damage to buildings and homes. A woman in her 30s died after a tree fell on a car in Haringey, north London, on Friday afternoon, the Metropolitan police said. It was the first confirmed death in England related to Eunice. A man in his 50s died in Netherton, Merseyside, after debris struck the windscreen of a vehicle he was travelling in. Another man in his 20s was killed in Alton, Hampshire, after a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter pick-up collided with a tree in Old Odiham Road just before midday. Earlier, a man in County Wexford, Ireland, was also killed by a falling tree. A member of the public suffered “serious injuries” after being struck by debris from a roof in Henley-on-Thames. Two men were also in hospital after being injured in similar, separate incidents in south London. The Met Office has issued a less severe yellow wind warning for much of the south coast of England and south Wales on Saturday, which it said “could hamper recovery efforts from Storm Eunice”. Areas affected by the warning could experience more bridge closures, travel delays and further power cuts. Icy stretches are also expected widely across Northern England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, with some snow in the regions. Five flood warnings were also still in place. Winds of 122mph were provisionally recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight on Friday, which, if verified, would be the highest ever recorded in England. The previous record was 118mph at Gwennap Head in Cornwall in 1979. Footage shared online captured planes struggling to land in high winds, damage to the roof of the O2 arena in London, and the spire of St Thomas Church in Wells, Somerset, crashing to the ground.",News/UK news,Storm Eunice: hundreds of thousands still without power in UK ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/19/hundreds-of-thousands-without-power-in-uk-after-storm-eunice-disruption-services
2/19/2022,"When The Handmaid’s Tale first came out in 1985, the initial response was broadly that people thought such threats to women’s bodies and reproductive rights “couldn’t happen here”. By the time it aired as a TV series in 2017, just after Donald Trump was inaugurated in the US, people were no longer so sure. With every headline about gains in reproductive rights – Ireland repealing the eighth amendment in 2018, which had effectively banned abortions – there are others that underscore how fragile these rights are, wherever you live. Recent changes to abortion law in Texas, which have prohibited abortions after six weeks – one of the most restrictive rules in the nation – and Poland’s near total ban on the procedure last year make it clear just how slippery the slope still is. We have to ask: what kind of country do we want to live in? A democratic one in which every individual is free to make decisions concerning their health and body, or one in which half the population is free and the state corrals the bodies of the other half?  Women who are not allowed to make their own decisions about whether or not to give birth are, in fact, owned by the state, as the state claims the right to dictate the uses to which their bodies must be put. The work of the Abortion Support Network (ASN) and the need for it in apparently progressive Europe is a stiff reminder: democratic rights don’t grow on trees. They must be struggled for and maintained. Those at risk of forced childbearing should be very grateful to have such organisations and their volunteers in their corner. – MARGARET ATWOOD In the evenings, after she is done with her day job in London, Ciara makes phone calls to people across Europe. Everyone she calls has contacted the ASN, a UK-based charity that helps people from European countries to access abortions. She is one of about 80 volunteers providing logistical advice, travel planning, a place to stay and solidarity to people who live in countries with restrictive abortion access. Mara Clarke, who founded ASN in 2009, says, “People think that abortion travel is an American or developing-world thing, but it isn’t.” While there has rightfully been extensive coverage of the US, given the introduction of restrictive abortion laws in Texas and the potential for the Roe v Wade ruling to be overturned this year, the evolving situation in Europe has received little attention. When she set up ASN, Clarke was told there was no demand for a European abortion helpline. “I knew that wasn’t right,” she says. “If there were women who could afford to pay to travel for an abortion, there were other women who couldn’t.” Clarke was proved right. Calls came first from the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, and the charity began helping hundreds of women every year. As abortion laws became more liberal in those countries in 2018 and 2019, ASN opened their services to Poland, Malta and Gibraltar, and anyone else in Europe who needs it (just because abortion is technically legal in a country does not mean it is always straightforward to access). ASN also works with partner organisations across the continent who direct people to one another for local advice and funding. I grew up in Dublin. Abortion was something I’d talk about with my friends, but the “going to England” part it entailed was mysterious to us. There was always this concern that if one of us needed an abortion, none of us would know how to go about it. I heard about ASN when I went to a vigil at the Irish embassy in London in 2012 for Savita Halappanavar. Savita had died from a septic miscarriage at a Galway hospital after her requests for an abortion were denied. Her death underlined to me that the fight for reproductive rights is about life and death, and it drove the campaign to repeal Ireland’s eighth amendment, which effectively banned abortion. I began donating to ASN, and soon after responded to a call for volunteers. Working on the helpline was scary at first. I got training and support, but I was speaking to people in vulnerable situations. In my second week, a man called from a Northern Ireland hospital because his wife’s pregnancy was in danger. He thought they might have to travel to England to get an abortion and wanted to know what he needed to do. We work with each caller to see what they need. It can be anything from a simple question about arranging an appointment at a clinic, to figuring out the most efficient travel plan for them and assisting with money. The later the abortion, the more expensive it becomes. The cost of the procedure, which is £1,300 in England for a second trimester abortion, plus travel, childcare and time off work, can be high. Money is often the biggest hurdle for our callers. I’ve given a grant of £5 before – that was all that was preventing a woman from accessing an abortion. You need to speak to most clients several times. I fit the calls around my day job, either during lunchtime or in the evenings. When I was in the office, I’d find a meeting room where I could speak privately. It can require a mental shift to go from speaking to someone about something that is so emotionally challenging for them, to returning to my regular life. You really get the warm and fuzzies from doing this. In 2018, when the eighth amendment was put to a referendum in Ireland and repealed, an ASN colleague was approached by a woman who mentioned me by name and said I saved her life. I think about that often. A few years ago I joined some activist groups on Facebook and saw ASN’s ad for Polish-speaking volunteers. This work combines my two favourite things: feminism and logistics. When someone calls, I can give tangible support. There are people who know what they need, and others who are completely lost and just say, “Please help me.” We have a checklist of questions to understand their circumstances. We find out how far along they are, as there are different legal limits in different countries – sometimes abortion pills can be an answer. The UK has the longest limit at 24 weeks. That, and where they live, helps us figure out the most suitable place for callers to travel to. Most people from Poland travel to the Netherlands or Spain, and most people from Ireland go to England. We get calls from other countries where the law is more liberal; in Italy, many doctors conscientiously object to abortion and in France abortion is permitted on demand only up to 14 weeks. Now we ask about passports; Brexit means people from the EU can no longer travel to the UK using only their national ID card, which affects many callers. We also find out how much money they have, to give grants. Callers are often angry, especially from Poland. They feel abandoned by the government and stigmatised by society. It can be nice to offer solidarity and say, “It’s not you, it’s the system. It shouldn’t be like this.” And to remind them that they are not alone. There’s this unspoken assumption that abortion is always a difficult choice, or there is suffering to endure, but that’s not the reality. No one wants an abortion, but there are people who don’t feel guilt. I’ve also spoken to callers who didn’t believe in abortion, but need one. The work can get stressful and busy, but there’s a feeling of solidarity. We have a few WhatsApp groups, and when something happens, the volunteers reach out and lift each other up; that support is tremendous. My daughter works at the city’s Merseyside Clinic and told me there were women coming over from Ireland seeking abortions who had nowhere to stay. This was nine years ago and I thought, “I’ve got a spare room.” I became ASN’s first host in Liverpool. There are about seven of us now. We get emails asking if anyone can take a client on particular dates. When I say yes, I’m given their name, age and when they’re coming. It’s not a lot of background, but it’s as much as I need. Everybody I’ve hosted has come from Ireland. Even though the law has changed there, access to an abortion after 12 weeks is permitted only in limited circumstances, so the women who come now tend to be further along than they used to be. I’ll pick them up, make a meal and we’ll eat together. Some want to tell you everything about their lives and you have a laugh; others are feeling more vulnerable and don’t want to engage. I let people talk as much or as little as they want. Why they are having an abortion has nothing to do with me. Most come on their own. Many have children at home. Often they haven’t told anyone what they’re doing. I had a young woman who was a refugee in Ireland. There was also a grandmother who brought her 15-year-old granddaughter. The people who come are so brave and strong to travel such a distance. They’re having to make decisions and organise things quickly. It’s rewarding to be able to support them through that. I was against abortion when I was younger because that was the only reality I knew. Malta is a Catholic country and there is anti-abortion sentiment in its institutions. We’re taught from a young age that abortion is synonymous with murder, and that a woman who seeks one is evil. Maltese law states that abortion is a criminal offence, with no exceptions. Any person who seeks or helps with one can face up to three years in prison. The penalty is higher for medical professionals. I became interested in women’s rights around 2016 when the morning-after pill became legally available. I’ve volunteered for the Family Planning Advisory Service in Malta since it started in 2020. It’s a pro-choice helpline providing information about reproductive health choices. Because of the law in Malta, we cannot help people get an abortion or give them money towards travel to get one, but we can share publicly available information, like the fact that ASN exists. The main danger in this work is the social stigma. Malta is a small country and you can be easily identified. The stigma is greater if you’re a woman and even more so if you are a person of colour. It’s framed as, “Look at this person who is foreign and bringing this evil on us.” Sometimes people are surprised that I do this. I wear a hijab and people associate being religious with being anti-choice and anti-abortion. But that is misinformation and ignorance about how Muslims view abortion. This work is my way of standing up against damaging patriarchal structures that affect me and my peers. My job is to make posts for ASN’s Instagram that help people understand the charity’s work and encourage people to donate. I fit it in around my day job. I became interested in abortion access when I was 17. I was at boarding school and a girl asked me for help getting an abortion. She felt alone and terrified – and this was in England where abortion is legal. I hate that people from countries where abortion isn’t legal are panicking about money, childcare and booking flights. Being an openly queer person, I’m no stranger to online abuse and harassment, which helps with the moderation side of the job. We have a coordinated response which boils down to, “Don’t feed the trolls.” So on Instagram, hateful comments get deleted immediately and people get blocked. We have a lot of evangelical Christian, American men harassing us. “Murderers” is a common insult. And there’s a lot of misogynistic harassment and insinuations that if a woman wants to have unprotected sex, then she should have to deal with the consequences. An American man was repeatedly making threatening comments on our Facebook page and one of our followers reported him to the FBI. He was recently sentenced to 20 months. You can feel powerless in the face of the wave of restrictions on people’s bodily autonomy. But it does feel powerful to know the work we’re doing changes lives. After the recent death of a 37-year-old woman who was denied an abortion in Poland, there’s been an atmosphere of grief here. It’s the third known case reported since a near-total ban came into force in January 2021. Three years ago, I moved to the Netherlands and a friend told me the Abortion Network Amsterdam (ANA) needed Polish-speaking volunteers. I did email shifts responding to people and helping them set up travel and appointments. I once accompanied someone to a clinic; my role was to translate, but there was a support element, too. ANA helps people with costs, and when their funds aren’t enough, they contact ASN. Both are part of the Abortion Without Borders network, which is made up of groups across Europe. The volume of emails increased dramatically in the run-up to the Polish abortion ban. After I returned to Poland six months ago, I had to stop helping individuals directly: I work as a translator, helping with medical records and press releases, but I no longer set up abortions myself because when you’re in Poland, you have to be far more careful. You need to find where the line lies and that’s murky; the way the laws are set up means there’s a lot of room for interpretation. We’re very careful to stick to things we can’t be prosecuted for. While we don’t have control over what happens in Polish hospitals, and we can’t change the law on our own, doing this work gives me a sense of agency in an otherwise overwhelming situation. “I am 21 weeks and three days pregnant. I wish I could have this baby, but it has been diagnosed with severe brain defects. I need help in arranging a trip abroad. I have no idea how to go about this.” “I am eight or nine weeks pregnant. I have a very difficult family and financial situation. My husband beats me and my children, and abuses alcohol. I don’t want the same for my third child. My husband raped me and it turns out that I am pregnant.” “I am pregnant: 21 weeks. I only found out at 16 weeks. I live in Poland. I cannot have this baby. I have no money or support because the baby’s father left me as soon as he found out. I don’t have money to go abroad to a clinic, so I ordered abortion pills, but after over a month, they still haven’t arrived. I don’t know what to do.” “I am 18 weeks pregnant and the baby has a serious heart defect. The doctors told me to expect that at any moment the baby may die. I can’t bear it, I can’t function normally. All the antenatal tests so far have ruined us financially because they are not covered in Poland.” “I feel incapacitated in my country and am ashamed that I live here and have to get help from people from a foreign country. I know that after the procedure a stone will fall from my heart. Carrying such a sick child is probably every mother’s worst nightmare. I will be grateful to you till the end of my life, and I will support you as much as I can because there will be more women like me because of the stupid law in this country.” “The doctor told me the baby was very unlikely to survive in the womb, but because of our legislation I was not able to access an abortion. I wish that I lived in a country where they trusted women to make the right choices for themselves.” “I don’t want to write that our pregnancy was a matter of life and death, but it was. You gave us a chance for further life. We are still so shocked and grateful that there is still such a thing as genuine, honest kindness and selflessness in this world.”",News/World news,"The abortion travel agents: ‘Some women know what they need, others just say: help’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/the-abortion-travel-agents-some-women-know-what-they-need-others-just-say-help-europe-margaret-atwood
