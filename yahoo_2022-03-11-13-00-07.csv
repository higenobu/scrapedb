3/11/2022,"By Karen Lema MANILA (Reuters) - When Philippine Catholic priest Father Nap Baltazar raised his hands to bless the people attending mass, the sleeves on his white vestment slid back to reveal a pink bracelet inscribed with the words ""Let Leni Lead"". Baltazar, 47, belongs to a group of like-minded priests in Asia's biggest Catholic nation who have abandoned their neutrality to oppose the presidential bid of Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the late dictator's son and namesake, and openly endorse his closest rival Leni Robredo, whose team colour is pink. The presidential election is set for May 9, and latest opinion polls show Marcos, also known as ""Bongbong"", holds a double-digit lead over closest rival Robredo, while his running mate, Sara Duterte-Carpio, daughter of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte, remained the top choice for the vice presidency. ""I will do everything I can to make sure he does not sit as president,"" Baltazar said of the 64-year old Marcos. The priest, who says he has never before campaigned publicly for a politician since being ordained, drives a van adorned with an image of Robredo and the words ""Pray and Choose Wisely. Your future depends on it"" written in pink. Back in 1986, the Catholic Church championed a ""People Power"" uprising that overthrew Marcos's father and drove his family to exile. But now, Marcos Jr, a former congressman and senator, appears poised to clinch the presidency, following a decades-long political fight back by a family accused of leading one of Asia's most notorious kleptocracies. The elder Marcos ruled for two decades, almost half of it under martial law during which thousands of his opponents were beaten and tortured, and disappeared or were killed. UNTHINKABLE Robredo, 56, narrowly defeated Marcos in the 2016 vice presidential contest. She is the leader of the opposition and the only female candidate in this year's presidential race. A former human rights lawyer, she has been a thorn in Duterte's side, questioning his war on drugs, his embrace of China and recently the handling of COVID-19. ""Leni happens to encapsulate the values of the Church and that is why I am not afraid to show my face and support her,"" said Father Edwin Gariguez, while meeting with people in his diocese in Calapan, south of the capital, in a pink mask and pink shirt promoting Robredo. The return of a Marcos to the country's seat of power is unthinkable for millions of Filipinos, including for Father John Era, who started the ""Pari, Madre, Misyonero Para Kay Leni (Priests, Nuns and Missionaries for Leni)"", hoping to use their ""influence"" to rally support behind her. Marcos has been campaigning on a promise to bring unity to the Philippines but is not entertaining questions about atrocities during his father's rule, which his critics say his family has neither apologised for, nor properly acknowledged. ""While presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos is calling for unity, we are saddened by the men and women of the Catholic clergy who are doing the exact opposite and have abused the pulpit, allowing it to become a platform for hateful and negative campaigning,"" his spokesman, Vic Rodriguez, said. ""As men and women of the cloth, they should be more circumspect, refrain from openly meddling with politics and stop making reckless imputations or statements that only serve as spiritual, moral, social and cultural poison,"" he added. The Catholic Church, which also participated in a popular movement in 2001 that led to the ouster of another president, Joseph Estrada, is at the Philippines' core. Four-fifths of the nation's over 110 million population are Catholics, and many still practice their faith with gusto. PARTISAN POLITICS Not everyone in the Church approves of the priests' actions, which have also drawn mixed reactions from Filipinos, who have taken to social media to either praise or decry the clergymen for taking political sides. Father Jerome Secillano, Public Affairs executive secretary at the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), said the Church law forbids clergymen from engaging in partisan politics, and the role of the Church and clerics is ""only for education and formation of consciences."" Leaders of other religious groups in the Philippines, like the Kingdom of Jesus Christ and El Shaddai, which politicians have courted in the past because their members are known to follow their leaders' advice, have also come out to back Marcos's candidacy. And while Bishop Pablo Virgilio David, the president of CBCP, said the Church would not dictate who its members should vote for in the election, he has hinted which side he favours. During a mass on Feb. 8 at his diocese in Caloocan, he gave his blessing over the decision of its lay leaders to support Robredo. ""It is not right to be neutral when truth and the country's future are at stake,"" said David who was wearing a pink face mask. ""To be neutral means that you support evil.""

3/11/2022,"Legislation restricting how race is discussed in the workplace was approved by Florida lawmakers and sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis, paving the way for the first law of its kind in the country. The measure takes aim at any corporate training that makes employees feel discomfort or distress by suggesting that they are responsible for actions “committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex or national origin.” It is part of a nationwide push to control how issues of race and identity are taught in corporations. DeSantis has made battling ""critical race theory"" one of his top legislative priorities. The state Senate on Thursday voted 24-15 along party lines to approve the measure. If signed by DeSantis, workers could sue their employers. CRITICAL RACE THEORY BAN: ""Corporate-sanctioned racism""? How war on critical race theory spread from schools to big business RUSSIA UKRAINE WAR: ""The more doom I see, the more I want to see it"": Why we can't stop doomscrolling Ukraine “This is a major moment for the anti-critical race theory movement. We have translated our intellectual efforts into concrete public policy,” conservative activist Christopher Rufo, who advised DeSantis on the legislation, wrote in his newsletter. Across the country, conservatives are pushing bills that put varying limits on workplace diversity training. The measures tend to use language banning “divisive concepts” such as “an individual, by virtue of their race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive.” In December, DeSantis urged his state’s GOP-led Legislature to pass legislation. “How is it not a hostile work environment to be attacking people based on their race or telling them that they are privileged or that they are part of oppressive systems when all they are doing is showing up to work and trying to earn a living?” DeSantis told supporters at a campaign-style event in December at which Rufo spoke. “We believe this corporate CRT is basically corporate-sanctioned racism.” State Senate Democrats argued the proposed legislation would lead to frivolous lawsuits and accused DeSantis, a possible 2024 presidential candidate who is up for reelection this year, of ""fanning the flames of a culture war for political gain.""

3/11/2022,"The new Hulu documentary ""Two Men at War"" features a 2021 interview with Biden. Biden said he once told Putin ""I don't think you have a soul"" during a 2011 visit to Russia. He said Putin replied, ""We understand one another."" When asked if he could trust Russian president Vladimir Putin at a 2001 summit in Slovenia, President George W. Bush famously said he looked Putin in the eye and ""was able to get a sense of his soul; a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country."" President Joe Biden looked Putin in the eye and saw something different. In the new Hulu documentary ""Two Men at War"" by ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, Biden recalled meeting with Putin at the Kremlin in 2011 — a story he also shared in a 2014 profile in The New Yorker by Evan Osnos. ""You said you know he doesn't have a soul,"" Stephanopoulos said in an interview with Biden recorded in March 2021. ""I did say that to him, yes,"" Biden said. ""And his response was 'We understand one another.' I wasn't being a wise guy, I was alone with him in his office. That's how it came about. It was when President Bush had said, 'I've looked in his eyes and saw his soul.' I said, 'I looked in your eyes and I don't think you have a soul,' and [he] looked back at me, he said, 'We understand each other.'"" ""So you know Vladimir Putin,"" Stephanopoulos said. ""You think he's a killer? ""Mm-hmm. I do,"" Biden said. ""Two Men at War,"" exploring Putin's and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's backgrounds, leadership styles, and relationships with the West amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, is currently streaming on Hulu.
