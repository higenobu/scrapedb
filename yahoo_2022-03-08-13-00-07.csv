3/8/2022,"One day after Russia revealed that it had detained seven-time WNBA All-Star Brittney Griner on drug charges, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was asked what the Biden administration planned to do to help her. Blinken, speaking Sunday from Moldova, was reluctant to comment specifically on Griner, citing “privacy considerations.” Answering generally, Blinken told reporters, “Whenever an American is detained anywhere in the world, we of course stand ready to provide every possible assistance, and that includes in Russia.” Griner was arrested at an airport near Moscow last month after Russian authorities searched her luggage and allegedly found vape cartridges containing hashish oil. The Russian Federal Customs Service issued a statement Saturday that it had opened a criminal investigation into the large-scale transportation of drugs, which in Russia can carry a prison sentence of up to 10 years. The timing of Griner’s detainment raises concerns that her fate could become entangled in the confrontation between Russia and the West over war in Ukraine. A former top Pentagon official told Yahoo Sports on Saturday that she’s concerned Russia may view Griner as a “high-profile hostage” who could serve as a valuable bargaining chip. If so, freeing Griner quickly could prove challenging. William Partlett, an associate professor at Melbourne Law School and an expert on Russian politics, told Yahoo Sports that the “decreasing connections and trust” between the U.S. and Russia are an obstacle, as is the possibility that Russia could demand more than the U.S. is willing to offer. “Maybe the U.S. has someone in custody who they could exchange?” Partlett said. “But the sanctions and aid to Ukraine will not be lessened in order to get her out.” It’s unclear exactly how long Griner has been in custody because Russian authorities have not specified when in February she was detained. At the time of her arrest, Griner had just flown from New York to Russia, where the two-time Olympic gold medalist plays for European basketball powerhouse UMMC Ekaterinburg during the WNBA offseason. In an Instagram post on Saturday night, Griner’s wife thanked “everyone who has reached out” with prayers and support. Cherelle Griner said she loves Brittney “wholeheartedly” and called this “one of the weakest moments” of her life. “I understand that many of you have grown to love BG over the years and have concerns and want details,” Cherelle Griner wrote. “Please honor our privacy as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.” Griner is not the first U.S. citizen Russia has held in custody as tensions between the two nations have escalated. The U.S. so far has been unable to negotiate the release of two former U.S. Marines that Russia has imprisoned. Trevor Reed was sentenced to nine years in a Russian prison in 2020 after he allegedly got into an altercation with Russian police. Paul Whelan was sentenced to 16 years in Russian prison in 2020 for alleged espionage. On Sunday, when responding to the question about Griner, Blinken brought up Whelan and Reed, and described both as “unjustly detained.” Blinken concluded, “We have an embassy team that’s working on the cases of other Americans who are detained in Russia. We’re doing everything we can to see to it that their rights are upheld and respected.” LGBTQ groups have expressed particular concern about the treatment of Griner given that she is an openly gay woman being detained in a country that has a history of restricting LGBTQ rights. Athlete Ally, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ rights in sports, tweeted Sunday, “Thinking of the countless times @brittneygriner has spoken out for LGBTQ+ equality. We all must speak out for her now and call for her to be safely released back home to her family.”",World/Yahoo Sports,U.S. Secretary of State responds to Russia's detainment of Brittney Griner,https://news.yahoo.com/us-secretary-of-state-responds-to-russias-detainment-of-brittney-griner-021344931.html
3/8/2022,"Mikhail Khodorkovsky was once Russia's richest man, before spending almost a decade in prison. He told CNN that the Ukraine war has ""significantly reduced"" Putin's ability to stay in power. ""We are no longer thinking in terms of him being around another decade,"" he said in the interview. Mikhail Khodorkovsky — an exiled oligarch who was once the richest man in Russia — said on Friday that Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has ""significantly reduced"" the longtime president's chances of remaining in power. ""I'm convinced that Putin hasn't got much time left. Maybe a year, maybe three,"" he told CNN during an interview, adding later, ""Today we are no longer thinking in terms of him being around another decade as we thought a week ago."" Khodorkovsky is the former CEO of the Russian oil giant Yukos, a position that temporarily made him Russia's richest man in 2003 with a reported net worth of $15 billion. In 2001, he founded Open Russia, a diplomacy initiative that was later shut down by Russian authorities. After being charged with fraud and tax evasion, Khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2005. He was later pardoned by Putin and released a year early in 2013. Khodorkovsky said his imprisonment was politically motivated. Putin's former prime minister testified that the Kremlin ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest due to his funding of the opposition party, according to a 2010 Reuters report. Now the exiled businessman lives in London and is known as one of Putin's most outspoken critics. In his interview with CNN, Khodorkovsky said Putin is his ""personal enemy"" but also ""the enemy of humankind."" A handful of Russian billionaires have spoken out over the past week to similarly denounce the invasion of Ukraine. His prediction that Russia's attack on Ukraine will eventually end Putin's rule has been echoed by experts at the Kennan Institute, a Russian research center in the US.

On Sunday, the 26-year-old model posted photos of herself curled up on her bathroom floor after suffering the after effects of drinking just ""one cup of coffee on an empty stomach."" The daughter of actors Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin went on to explain how coffee — which she admits drinking because ""I'm a silly goose"" — is a ""major esophageal irritator and reflux trigger for me, which leads to anxiety."" ""If you are an anxiety sufferer like myself, coffee isn't your friend,"" said Baldwin, who says she has to lie down ""until I can't cry or throw up anymore"" after a caffeine-trigged episode. ""Writing this and being open with y'all about my struggles helps it pass,"" she added, urging others with similar experiences to share. Indeed, many commenters noted that they too experience anxiety or even full-blown panic attacks after having coffee. The model's father, meanwhile, chimed in with a message of support, writing, ""I love you"" in response to her post. Baldwin, who shared a rare selfie with her actress mother over the weekend, has been candid about her mental health, from posting about self-love to sharing how social media can warp her view of herself. In January, she revealed that she has cardiophobia, admitting that she lives ""in a constant fear that I’m dying from a heart attack."" In addition to seeking treatment from anxiety specialists, using her own at-home blood pressure monitoring device has helped her find calm and distinguish the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as heart palpitations, from those of a cardiac episode. ""I just want anyone who suffers from their own anxieties to know that I am here and you are not alone. It can be so embarrassing and isolating at times,” she told her followers. “My anxiety has made me miss out on a lot in this life and my true 2022 goal is not let it get in my way.

3/8/2022,"Japanese scientists have started investigating the mysterious “mermaid mummy” that has long been an object of worship at a temple in Okayama Prefecture.

A team of researchers from the Kurashiki University of Science and the Arts are conducting scientific analyses of the mummified remains of the mysterious icon to determine what they are actually composed of.

The “mermaid mummy,” which measures around 1 foot, has earned its name for having an upper body that appears to be human and a lower body that looks like a fish tail.

The 300-year-old mummy, which has retained its nails, teeth and hair over the years, has also maintained the eerie expression of a screaming child.

Kozen Kuida, the chief priest at Enjuin temple in the city of Asakuchi, took out the artifact from the wooden box where it has been stored inside the school’s veterinary hospital for an examination on Feb. 2.

“We have worshiped it, hoping that it would help alleviate the coronavirus pandemic even if only slightly,” the head priest was quoted by Asahi Shimbun as saying. “I hope the research project can leave (scientific) records for future generations.”

According to Kuida, the mummy had been put on display for public viewing about 40 years ago, but it was recently stored in a fireproof safe so it won’t deteriorate.

A note inside the box claims that the mysterious creature was caught in a fishing net on the coast of Tosa Province (now Kochi Prefecture) between 1736 and 1741. The mummy was passed on to other owners after the turn of the Meiji Era (1868-1912) and ended up being acquired by the Enjuin temple.

The remains are to be studied from a variety of academic perspectives. Hiroshi Kinoshita, a 54-year-old board member of the Okayama Folklore Society, will study the mummy from the viewpoint of folklore studies, while Takafumi Kato, a 54-year-old paleontology professor, will conduct morphology analysis on the upper body of the artifact. Meanwhile, an associate professor that specializes in ichthyology will study the fish-like lower body, and an associate professor with expertise in molecular biology will do the DNA analysis.

The researchers are set to release their findings in fall of this year.

3/8/2022,"Naked and Afraid featured the first transgender woman contestant in the show’s history on Sunday's episode. Terra was assigned the male gender at birth, but four years ago began her transition to become female. “Things on the outside aren't what they are supposed to be at this point in my transgender transition,” Terra said. “I do have breasts and I do have the male genitalia still.” Terra is only the second transgender person to compete on the show. In 2019, transgender man Quince Mountain appeared on the show. Still, Terra was quite nervous what her partner would think. She was paired with a South African farmer named Shaun. While he described himself as “conservative,” he was nothing but welcoming to Terra. He even gave her a hug. “It is a bit of a shock to me,” Shaun admitted. “We're all unique and special. I'm open-minded and we're gonna do this together. Don't worry. I've got your back.” Unfortunately, Shaun only lasted three days into the trial. He collapsed and sustained a concussion from the fall. He was forced to tap out for medical reasons. Terra was able to complete the 21-day challenge, despite not finding much food and sustaining a lacerated nipple. Her appearance on the show was special from the standpoint of representation, but also for her own journey. “I'm not a gender, I'm not a label, I'm just a human,” Terra said while being extracted. “It's empowering. I'm going through my own transitional journey. And I know now that if I just stick with it there's nothing I cannot do in this world.” Naked and Afraid airs Sundays at 8 p.m. on Discovery.

3/8/2022,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Western countries could face oil prices of over $300 per barrel and the possible closure of the main Russia-Germany gas pipeline if governments follow through on threats to cut energy supplies from Russia, a senior minister said on Monday. Oil prices spiked to their highest levels since 2008 on Monday after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington and European allies were considering banning Russian oil imports. ""It is absolutely clear that a rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market,"" Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said in a statement on state television. ""The surge in prices would be unpredictable. It would be $300 per barrel if not more."" Novak said it would take Europe more than a year to replace the volume of oil it receives from Russia and it would have to pay significantly higher prices. ""European politicians need to honestly warn their citizens and consumers what to expect,"" Novak said. ""If you want to reject energy supplies from Russia, go ahead. We are ready for it. We know where we could redirect the volumes to."" Novak said Russia, which supplies 40% of Europe's gas, was fulfilling its obligations in full but that it would be entirely within its rights to retaliate against the European Union after Germany last month froze the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. ""In connection with ... the imposition of a ban on Nord Stream 2, we have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline,"" Novak said. ""So far we are not taking such a decision,"" he said. ""But European politicians with their statements and accusations against Russia push us towards that.""

3/8/2022,"TELLURIDE, Colo. — Set in a box canyon surrounded by 13,000-foot peaks, Telluride has long appealed to adventure-seekers and vacationers. But as the Covid-19 pandemic drags on, a balance has shifted: Out-of-towners working remotely have moved in, forcing longtime locals out. In Silverton, a remote town in southern Colorado, workers are living in campers or cars because they can’t find homes. Others are forced to commute up to 100 miles over mountain passes to get to work or crowd into one-bedroom apartments to afford rent. In Telluride, there were some days last summer that restaurants had to close their doors because of the number of tourists and lack of employees, said Hayley Nenadal, a filmmaker who lives in the historic town known for its challenging ski slopes and annual film festival. “You just don’t get coffee anymore, or you just don’t go to dinner anymore, or you just don’t have a place for your friends to gather anymore,” Nenadal said. “The large impact people feel is a loss of community and the loss of quality of life.” With the pandemic affecting people and institutions across the U.S. in countless ways, housing has become an inflection point for cities struggling to retain their workforces and local businesses. The issue has long been a challenge in Colorado’s mountain communities, but the pandemic has pushed it into overdrive, residents and experts say. “It took what was a slowly growing problem and made it a rapidly growing problem,” said Jason Peasley, executive director of the Yampa Valley Housing Authority in Steamboat Springs. “It’s very difficult for the local wage earners to compete with those folks that are coming from out of town with significantly higher resources.” An issue that once affected mostly low-wage earners has moved to the middle class, impacting teachers, police officers and nurses. The situation has forced high-country locales to come up with creative ways to ease the shortage, like limiting the number of short-term rentals in a community or raising taxes on people who own second homes and leave them vacant for long periods of time. Nenadal and other residents proposed a citizens initiative in 2021 that would have capped the number of short-term rentals in Telluride at just under 600. But voters rejected the plan and instead approved a two-year pause that will keep the number of short-term rental licenses at its current level of 787. “Housing has such far-reaching consequences,” said Margaret Bowes, executive director of the Colorado Association of Ski Towns, which represents 40 cities and counties. “It’s impacting the level of service that a mountain town can provide to their guests, and that has the potential to really impact the reputation of that town.” For years, housing authorities and cities have been buying or converting properties to sell to workers at below-market rates. Recently, they’ve begun experimenting with more innovative ideas, such as providing down payment or rental assistance to local buyers; placing deed restrictions on properties so they have to be sold to area workers; placing appreciation caps on properties to keep them affordable over time; and providing cash incentives to property owners to shift from short-term to long-term leases. Even some business owners are buying properties that they then rent to employees. Eagle County, which encompasses the ski town of Vail in central Colorado, plans to soon launch a loan program for property owners who want to build or renovate accessory dwelling units that would be rented to area workers. “It really is a struggle,” said Anne Lowe, open space and trails manager for the city of Breckenridge. “It’s rare to find a single-family home under $1 million, and any of those require tons of work.” Lowe and her husband bought a single-family home in 2019 through Housing Helps, a program in Breckenridge that pays homeowners, buyers and investors to place deed restrictions on their properties guaranteeing they will be used for local housing. Currently, 11 percent of Breckenridge’s housing stock is resident-occupied, but its goal is 35 percent. Through Housing Helps, Lowe and her husband received 15 percent of the purchase price of their home to use as a down payment, which lowered their monthly mortgage payment and allowed them to save money for needed repairs. “We didn’t have to stress and pick up second jobs to afford to live close to town,” Lowe said. A lease-to-locals pilot program that Breckenridge started in October has converted 55 bedrooms from short-term to long-term rentals. Still, progress is slow. The waitlist for Eagle County’s deed-restriction program jumped from 100 potential buyers to nearly 500 over the last couple of years, said Kim Bell Williams, executive director of the Eagle County Housing and Development Authority. Some of these efforts may soon get a boost as state lawmakers debate how to spend $400 million in leftover federal Covid relief money, which they’ve earmarked for housing. Despite these new initiatives, Colorado faces a significant supply shortage. Fading West Development, a construction company in Buena Vista, hopes to help fill that void by manufacturing 600 to 700 modular homes a year in an 11,000-square-foot factory it opened in November. Buena Vista’s first modular housing community, The Farm at Buena Vista, opened in 2016 with homes built in Nebraska. Fading West is currently pre-building homes for high-country communities throughout the state, including Gunnison, Leadville and Montrose. “There’s no way you can build affordable housing with the resources in these communities,” Fading West founder and CEO Charlie Chupp said. “There are just not enough electricians, plumbers, general contractors. “The ability of off-site construction to increase the supply side is critical. … I believe this is the most efficient way to deliver housing.” Bowes, with the ski town association, said it will take some time to see broad-scale success, but “we know every unit that can be gained is a win.” CORRECTION (March 7, 2022, 1:20 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the year a citizens initiative was proposed in Telluride.

3/8/2022,"SEATTLE (AP) — Tampa Bay Buccaneers cornerback Richard Sherman pleaded guilty in Seattle on Monday to two misdemeanor charges stemming from a drunken driving and domestic disturbance last summer, as part of an agreement that spares him further jail time. Sherman was arrested July 14 after police said he crashed his SUV in a construction zone and tried to break into his in-laws’ suburban Seattle home. His father-in-law, Raymond Moss, told officers that he armed himself with a handgun and fired pepper-spray at Sherman to protect his family. The break-in attempt was captured on the home’s surveillance camera, which was later released by the court. Sherman, who said after the arrest he was “deeply remorseful,” pleaded guilty Monday in King County Superior Court to two misdemeanor counts, first-degree negligent driving and second-degree criminal trespass. He also admitted to a criminal infraction of speeding in a roadway construction zone. “I’m grateful for the community we have and the way people continue to accept you even though you're a flawed human being and made a mistake,” Sherman told the court. Sherman, a former star with the Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers, will pay about $825 in legal fees, plus $500 for speeding in the construction zone, and be under court supervision for two years. He will be responsible for paying an as-yet-undetermined amount in restitution for damage to his in-laws' house and to the state transportation department. The judge gave Sherman credit for the two days he spent in custody when he was first arrested and suspended the 88 days remaining on the sentence, meaning he won’t be required to serve any additional time behind bars if he keeps out of trouble. In an email, the King County prosecutor's office said the resolution was in line with comparable cases. “Mr. Sherman did not get special treatment one way or the other,” spokesman Casey McNerthney wrote. Sherman originally faced several misdemeanor charges, including driving under the influence, reckless endangerment of roadway workers, second-degree criminal trespass, resisting arrest and third-degree malicious mischief. Sherman had been belligerent, drinking heavily and had spoken of killing himself when he left his home in Maple Valley the night of July 13, according to police reports. His wife, Ashley Sherman, called 911 to try to have police stop him. He crashed in a construction zone along Highway 520 and then went to his in-laws' home in Redmond. Sherman, 33, became a Seattle sports legend during seven seasons with Seahawks. The cornerback was a star in their run to a 2014 Super Bowl victory, making a game-saving play to deflect a pass in the NFC championship game against the 49ers.

3/8/2022,"By Catherine Belton LONDON (Reuters) -Russia has told Ukraine it is ready to halt military operations ""in a moment"" if Kyiv meets a list of conditions, the Kremlin spokesman said on Monday. Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was demanding that Ukraine cease military action, change its constitution to enshrine neutrality, acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory, and recognise the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent states. It was the most explicit Russian statement so far of the terms it wants to impose on Ukraine to halt what it calls its ""special military operation"", now in its 12th day. Peskov told Reuters in a telephone interview that Ukraine was aware of the conditions. ""And they were told that all this can be stopped in a moment."" There was no immediate reaction from the Ukrainian side. Russia has attacked Ukraine from the north, east and south, pounding cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv and the port of Mariupol. The invasion launched on Feb. 24, has caused the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two, provoked outrage across the world, and led to heavy sanctions on Moscow. But the Kremlin spokesman insisted Russia was not seeking to make any further territorial claims on Ukraine and said it was ""not true"" that it was demanding Kyiv be handed over. ""We really are finishing the demilitarisation of Ukraine. We will finish it. But the main thing is that Ukraine ceases its military action. They should stop their military action and then no one will shoot,"" he said. On the issue of neutrality, Peskov said: ""They should make amendments to the constitution according to which Ukraine would reject any aims to enter any bloc."" He added: ""We have also spoken about how they should recognise that Crimea is Russian territory and that they need to recognise that Donetsk and Lugansk are independent states. And that’s it. It will stop in a moment."" NEW TALKS The outlining of Russia's demands came as delegations from Russia and Ukraine prepared to meet on Monday for a third round of talks aimed at ending Russia’s war against Ukraine. It began soon after Putin recognised two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014, as independent - an action denounced as illegal by the West. ""This is not us seizing Lugansk and Donetsk from Ukraine. Donetsk and Lugansk don’t want to be part of Ukraine. But it doesn’t mean they should be destroyed as a result,"" Peskov said. ""For the rest. Ukraine is an independent state that will live as it wants, but under conditions of neutrality."" He said all the demands have been formulated and handed over during the first two rounds of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, which took place last week. ""We hope that all this will go OK and they will react in a suitable way,"" Peskov said. Russia had been forced into taking decisive actions to force the demilitarisation of Ukraine, he said, rather than just recognising the independence of the breakaway regions. This was in order to protect the 3 million Russian-speaking population in these republics, who he said were being threatened by 100,000 Ukrainian troops. ""We couldn’t just recognise them. What were we going to do with the 100,000 army that was standing at the border of Donetsk and Lugansk that could attack at any moment. They were being brought U.S. and British weapons all the time,"" he said. In the run-up to the Russian invasion, Ukraine repeatedly and emphatically denied Moscow's assertions that it was about to mount an offensive to take back the separatist regions by force. Peskov said the situation in Ukraine had posed a much greater threat to Russia’s security than it had in 2014, when Russia had also amassed 150,000 troops at its border with Ukraine, prompting fears of a Russian invasion, but had limited its action to the annexation of Crimea. ""Since then the situation has worsened for us. In 2014, they began supplying weapons to Ukraine and preparing the army for NATO, bringing it in line with NATO standards,"" he said. ""In the end what tipped the balance was the lives of these 3 million people in Donbass. We understood they would be attacked."" Peskov said Russia had also had to act in the face of the threat it perceived from NATO, saying it was ""only a matter of time"" before the alliance placed missiles in Ukraine as it had in Poland and Romania. ""We just understood we could not put up with this any more. We had to act,"" he said.

3/8/2022,"It’s time to celebrate, Idaho, so cut yourself an extra-large piece of cake. Make it angel food. And chase it with a bottle of O’Doul’s. For the first time in the history of humankind, Idaho officially can declare itself America’s least sinful state. That’s according to an annual study from WalletHub, the personal finance website that invents a ranking for everything. Its new article, “2022’s Most Sinful States in America,” places Idaho at the absolute bottom of the list: No. 50. We out-goody-two-shoed our prissy, sanctimonious Utah neighbors by a whopping eight spots. Go jump in a Salt Lake, sinners! WalletHub says it compared all of the states “across 47 key indicators of immoral or illicit behavior. Our data set ranges from violent crimes per capita to excessive drinking to the share of the population with gambling disorders.” Here’s where the Gem State finished in the major categories — 1 being most sinful, 50 being least sinful: ▪ Anger & Hatred: 41st ▪ Jealousy: 50th ▪ Excesses & Vices: 36th ▪ Greed: 38th ▪ Lust: 41st ▪ Vanity: 41st ▪ Laziness: 30th What makes us so morally superior in Idaho? Is it our willingness to suffer with a smile — and an alcohol ban — while floating the Boise River on 100-degree days? Is it the fact that Boise strip clubs actually are “bikini” bars? No nudity allowed. By law. By God! Is it because the Gem State will never, ever, ever legalize the devil’s lettuce? Not even for medical reasons? No clue. I’m too busy adjusting my halo in the mirror to worry about that stuff. So which state is the most sinful? Unsurprisingly, that brothel-loving, gambling-ravaged gutter Nevada. (I haven’t set foot there in, like, four months.) What’s worrisome, though? The runner-up for most sinful state is California. Right behind Nevada. How much longer can Idaho maintain its innocence with all those depraved Golden Staters invading our pristine land? If things get bad, we could all just move next door to Oregon. Despite its gazillion pot shops and nudie bars, Oregon is a respectable No. 35 on the list. Which does bring the entire exercise into question. Incidentally, if you feel like you’ve read this column before? You sorta have. We Idahoans have come very close to being the least sinful state in the past — third place in 2020, fifth in 2019. I’ve run out of ideas on how to write about it, so I just recycle. And it’s impossible for me to plagiarize off myself. It wouldn’t be a sin, anyway. After all, I’m an Idahoan.",U.S./Idaho Statesman,"Utah, stick this in your pipe and smoke it!

3/8/2022,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan hit out on Sunday at Islamabad-based Western envoys who last week urged Pakistan to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine, asking them if they thought Pakistan was their ""slave"". The heads of 22 diplomatic missions, including those of European Union member states, released a joint letter on March 1 urging Pakistan to support a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine. The move to release the letter publicly was rare. ""What do you think of us? Are we your slaves ... that whatever you say, we will do?"" Khan said while addressing a political rally. In the event, Pakistan, a traditional ally of the West, abstained from voting as the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly reprimanded Russia for invading Ukraine. ""I want to ask the European Union ambassadors: Did you write such a letter to India?"" Khan said, noting that Pakistan's arch-rival had also abstained. Khan also said European countries had not censured India for its actions in Kashmir, a mountainous region over which Pakistan and India have fought two wars. He said Pakistan had suffered because it had supported the Western NATO alliance in Afghanistan, and instead of gratitude faced criticism. Khan and his government found themselves in the spotlight after he went ahead with a visit to Moscow in late February as fears of an invasion were growing, and met Vladimir Putin a few hours after the Russian president had ordered his troops into Ukraine. ""We are friends with Russia, and we are also friends with America; we are friends with China and with Europe; we are not in any camp,"" Khan added, saying Pakistan would remain ""neutral"" and work with those trying to end the war in Ukraine. On Friday, a Pakistani foreign office spokesman said it was ""not usual diplomatic practice"" for envoys to make appeals such as their letter public, ""and we have made that clear"".

But sometimes The Act star will drop a pic that’ll completely blow you away. Case in point... Joey just casually shared a photo of herself working a bra top and she accessorized the whole thing with a six-pack you could grate cheese on. She kept the caption simple, tagging “@boss 🖤.” Aaand people totally lost it in the comments. “Omg Joey😍😍😍,” one person wrote. “Abs for days!!!!” another said. I mean, seriously: This is hardly the first time Joey has gifted the world with an impressive abs shot lately. She shared these of herself hanging by a waterfall in Costa Rica with her fiance Steven Piet last week: And then there was this one of Joey (and jacked abs) from a hike she took back in November. Joey hasn’t given a ton of details about what, exactly, she does to look like that, but she has been open about the fact that exercise is important to her. She told The New Potato that she exercises four to five times a week and focuses on running and boxing. Joey also shared that she’s big into exercise ""because I feel energetic and happy when I work out on a regular basis.” She also does some of her own stunts, which doesn’t hurt. Joey told Byrdie that she spent three to four hours a day learning stunts for her upcoming role in The Princess, and it all sounds pretty intense. ""I wake up, I pack my Gatorade and many liters of water. I eat a big breakfast: a bowl of oats with lots of fruit and some toast. I head to training, where I f*ckin' go for it for a few hours,” she said. Joey told The New Potato that she tries “to eat as healthfully as possible, but I don’t make myself crazy.” That means listening to her body and having things that she feels like, while still aiming to be healthy overall. ""If I’m craving a piece of bread or a bowl of pasta, sometimes I just need to listen to my body and indulge,” she said. “You definitely have to find a balance, though, because eating the right things has incredible health and healing benefits. It’s not about how you look–it’s about taking care of your body so you can be the best you."" Joey has been more than clear about the need to have a balanced, kind view of health and her body. “Above all else, I practice self-love,"" she said.

3/8/2022,"TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — They railed against politicians, conducted military-style exercises and spoke darkly of confronting tyrants scheming to seize their guns and enslave them. Yet historian JoEllen Vinyard says the “citizen militia"" activists she got to know in the 1990s didn't seem like the types who would abduct a governor or stage a coup. “I don't think they were dangerous,"" said Vinyard, an Eastern Michigan University professor emeritus and author of a book about far-right movements in the state. “They reminded me of the good old boys I knew growing up in Nebraska."" But as four men charged with conspiring to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer go on trial Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Grand Rapids, Vinyard and other political extremism scholars say things have changed in recent years. Their arrests came about three months before the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection that led to charges against many right-wing extremists and militants. In contrast to militants from before, who mostly avoided bloodshed with the horrific exception of the Oklahoma City bombing, some modern successors have taken a more radical and potentially violent turn. “This is a different type of domestic terrorism phenomenon than we've faced in previous decades — completely different from anything I've observed,” said Javed Ali, a University of Michigan professor who served with the FBI and intelligence agencies. “You've got all these points on a very diverse threat spectrum — not centralized in any one corner, no single groups, no national leadership, completely disorganized and disaggregated,” Ali said. “It's difficult for law enforcement to spot these threats. The Whitmer plot is a case in point."" The alleged kidnapping conspiracy involved members of a little-known cell called the “Wolverine Watchmen” and others who attended a July 2020 meeting in Ohio of self-styled “militia” leaders from several states, according to court documents. They were angry about pandemic lockdowns and other policies they considered dictatorial, investigators said. Some had joined a protest months earlier at the Michigan Capitol in Lansing, where armed demonstrators faced off with police and some carried guns into the Senate gallery. Federal prosecutors in October 2020 charged six suspects in the alleged plot, including Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks, who have pleaded guilty. Garbin received a six-year prison term; Franks will be sentenced later. The other four defendants are Adam Fox, Daniel Harris, Brandon Caserta and Barry Croft Jr. All are Michigan residents except Croft, who is from Delaware. Eight other men accused of aiding the conspiracy have been charged in state court. The Wolverine Watchmen  are among the small, secretive groups that have appeared in Michigan since the initial burst of paramilitary activism faded, Ali said. They began recruiting members on Facebook in November 2019 and communicated through an encrypted messaging platform, according to a state police affidavit. It said they held firearms training and tactical drills to prepare for “the boogaloo,“ an anticipated ""uprising against the government or impending politically motivated civil war.” The scheme against Whitmer was hatched the following summer during a meeting at which Watchmen discussed invading the statehouse and using explosives to distract law enforcement, Garbin acknowledged in his plea agreement. They considered executing the Democratic governor or putting her on trial, eventually deciding to abduct her at her family’s vacation home in northern Michigan, the document said. Informants and undercover agents helped foil the alleged plot. Vinyard, who attended meetings of self-described militia groups in southeastern Michigan for her research during the 1990s, said threatening language was rare then. Members had long lists of grievances, some targeting the United Nations and a federal government they believed had exceeded its constitutional authority, she said. But others involved local law enforcement and courts. “People talked about police harassment, truckers getting stopped by cops, fathers who had not been treated fairly when they got divorced and couldn't see their kids,” she said. Norman Olson, an Air Force veteran, gun shop owner and Baptist preacher who initially led the Michigan Militia, said then its members were outraged by deadly sieges involving federal agents at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and Waco, Texas. The militia drew international attention after the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building, which killed 168 people. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, convicted in the case, had attended meetings in Michigan. Olson said they'd been kicked out for advocating violence. By the early 2000s the movement appeared to lose steam, experts said, perhaps because of public revulsion over the bombing, internal strife, the presidency of gun-friendly George W. Bush and a crackdown on terrorism after the 9/11 attacks. Following President Barack Obama's election, it resurfaced on a wave of right-wing populism embodied by the Tea Party movement and Donald Trump that crested amid fury at COVID-19 restrictions. In 2010, the FBI charged nine members of a fundamentalist Christian sect in southeastern Michigan called Hutaree with conspiring to rebel against the government. The judge dismissed most of the case, but it signaled what some observers describe as the rise of a more incendiary segment of the far right. Even other paramilitary groups were uneasy with the Hutaree and notified authorities, according to a paper by Vanderbilt University sociologist Amy Cooter, who studies right-wing militancy. Lee Miracle, a longtime leader of the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia, urged restraint in a statement on the group's website after the Wolverine Watchmen arrests in 2020. “Our capacity for violence, as a free people, should always be well maintained, and kept within reach, but it should always be the LAST option,"" said Miracle, who did not return an email seeking additional comment. But organizations that track the more belligerent groups say they've made inroads in Michigan, which has an extensive history as a far-right breeding ground. The nonprofit Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project says among the most active are newcomers such as the Boogaloo Boys and the Proud Boys, a self-described “Western chauvinist” association. Another is the Michigan Liberty Militia, which had a visible presence at the state Capitol protest. The movement has splintered into many factions over the years because of leadership rivalries and ideological differences, said retired FBI agent Greg Stejskal, who dealt with the Michigan Militia in its early days. Still, it has remained overwhelmingly white, male and rooted in conspiratorial fear of losing guns and freedom. “They feel like they're subjugated, and this is their way of fighting back,"" he said. They've kept a somewhat lower profile since the kidnapping arrests and the invasion of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters seeking to overturn the 2020 election, said Rachel Goldwasser, a research analyst with the nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center. The outcome of the Michigan conspiracy trial, she said, may “indicate whether they stay in their foxholes or come out as a force in public again."" ___ Find AP’s full coverage of the Whitmer kidnap plot trial at: https://apnews.com/hub/whitmer-kidnap-plot-trial ___ Follow John Flesher on Twitter: www.twitter.com/johnflesher",U.S./Associated Press,Experts: Alleged plot against governor signals ominous shift,https://news.yahoo.com/experts-alleged-plot-against-governor-151402604.html
