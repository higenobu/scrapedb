3/23/2022,"Time is running out for governments to reach an ambitious Paris-style agreement for nature, say campaigners, who warn that crucial negotiations to protect biodiversity are moving at a “snail’s pace”. Amid increasingly alarming scientific assessments about the state of life on Earth, negotiators are meeting in Geneva for talks aimed at halting and reversing the destruction of wildlife and ecosystems that support human civilisation. Governments are hoping to make up for lost time in the much-delayed process, which should have seen an agreement in autumn 2020, with three concurrent meetings running until 29 March, the first time they have met in person since talks in Rome in March 2020 as the pandemic closed in. The draft UN convention on biological diversity (CBD) sets out targets for the end of the decade. These include protecting 30% of land and sea, eliminating billions of dollars of environmentally harmful government subsidies, and restoring at least a fifth of degraded freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems. The final version will be negotiated in Kunming, China, at the Cop15 summit, which is expected to be held at the end of August, the first time China has held the presidency for a major UN environmental agreement. At Cop15 – the 15th conference of the parties to the UN convention on biological diversity – governments will negotiate new targets to protect biodiversity for this decade. The accord, “a Paris agreement for nature”, aims to slow rampant biodiversity loss around the world and is part of the UN’s overarching plan that humanity should be living in harmony with nature by 2050. The summit was originally due to take place in October 2020 but after several delays it is hoped that a face-to-face meeting will happen in 2022. Why is it a big deal?Time is running out to take action. An international group of scientists, including Prof Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb, warned in January 2021 that the planet is facing a “ghastly future of mass extinction, declining health and climate-disruption upheavals” that threaten human survival. The world has failed to meet a single target agreed a decade ago to stem the destruction of wildlife and life-sustaining ecosystems. Are only governments worried?No. At the 2021 World Economic Forum, business leaders said biodiversity loss was the third biggest existential, or long-term threat, to the world and was among the top five risks in terms of impact, alongside infectious diseases, climate action failure, weapons of mass destruction and natural resource crises. What might the Kunming agreement look like?In January 2021, the UN convention on biological diversity published a 21-point draft of the agreement. It commits signatories to protect at least 30% of the planet, control invasive species and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%. Governments are yet to negotiate properly on the draft targets.  But campaigners say negotiations are moving slowly and another meeting before the final summit in China might be necessary. Guido Broekhoven, head of policy at WWF International, said: “Despite countries arriving in Geneva committed to making progress on a global plan to tackle nature loss, the complexity of the issues discussed have led negotiations to move forward at a snail’s pace over the last week. We are yet to see governments try to close the enormous gap between the unambitious draft global biodiversity framework currently on the table.” These concerns were echoed by Li Shuo, a policy adviser for Greenpeace China, who has been following the biodiversity negotiations closely. “Many of the issues, we simply don’t have enough time to deal with,” he said. “Several of the most important discussions have not happened yet and I don’t think there will be time in Geneva. I am worried watching the sessions and we can’t keep kicking the can down the road.” Unlike its sister climate convention, which has one overarching aim, the CBD balances three main goals: conservation, sustainable use of biodiversity and the fair sharing of benefits from genetic resources. Its scope and complexity mean targets can sometimes compete with each other, and sources said another in-person meeting might be needed ahead of the final talks in China later this year. Curbs on agricultural pollution and sharing the benefits of digital genetic resources are expected to be particularly controversial, but a recent decision by 173 governments to draw up a legally binding treaty on plastics pollution has bolstered negotiations. Despite concerns about the speed of negotiations, UN diplomats leading the process said there were signs of hope. “I am cautiously optimistic,” said Basile van Havre, co-chair of the CBD working group responsible for drafting the agreement, from the talks in Geneva. “We need to find the bliss point between ambition and resources. For example, there will be a good discussion here on 30 by 30 [the target to protect 30% of land and sea by 2030] with the provision that it will be approved if there is money on the table. I am interested to see how the discussion on pollution unfolds, particularly on pesticides and nutrients,” he said. Last month, the UK, US, Canada and Argentina blocked proposals to halve nitrogen waste – commonly the result of intensive farming and fossil fuels – at the UN environment assembly in Nairobi, Kenya. The decision raised questions about a draft target to reduce nutrient runoff by at least 50% by 2030. How this decade’s targets will be enforced and monitored is also under discussion in Geneva. Governments have never met a target to halt the destruction of nature. “The previous targets didn’t inspire public and political action. I don’t think they were very well known,” said Bernadette Fischler Hooper, head of international advocacy at WWF UK. She said becoming “nature positive” by 2030 must become the north star for biodiversity, akin to the 1.5C and 2C targets in the Paris agreement. “If we get an inspiring mission from this new framework, it will become a joint rallying cry like the one we have for climate,” she said.

3/23/2022,"With this superb true-crime drama from 2000, now on re-release, director Andrew Dominik made a brilliant debut. But in terms of sheer star-birth impact, Dominik had nothing on the breakthrough made by the leading man he’d found, former TV comic Eric Bana who gave the big-screen performance of his life, reeking with lairy anti-charm and black comic charisma. Bana plays Mark “Chopper” Read, the notoriously violent and misogynist Melbourne criminal on whose unreliable but bestselling memoirs the film is based. We see him in jail in the late 70s, grinning, giggling and monologuing with eerie lack of fear; first launching a savage attack on rival tough guy Keithy George (David Field) in the prison association room, then snarlingly informing his cringing lieutenant Jimmy Loughnan (Simon Lyndon) that he intends to put the whole prison under siege by attacking some warders. Rather than get involved in this crazy scheme, Jimmy tries to murder Chopper with a knife, but his victim withstands the assault with almost superhuman strength, cuts his own ears off to get to a segregated wing, defends himself successfully in court against the charge that he was the one who attacked Jimmy first and then, once out of prison, his fear and casual loathing of women explodes and he uses his informant status with local police to claim he has carte-blanche to attack bad guys with the cops’ blessing. It’s an arrangement which leads to nonstop chaotic mayhem, fuelled by Chopper’s coke-addled paranoia. Bana is simply superb, both as the clean-shaven moon-faced young sociopath we encounter first of all, and then as the chubbier, gold-toothed, moustachioed headbanger he turns into. In every scene – cell, courtroom, dodgy club, sordid flat – Bana holds your attention effortlessly, often getting big laughs. It’s a performance you could compare with Joe Pesci in GoodFellas, and actually appreciably better than Tom Hardy’s performance as the comparable British convict Charles Bronson in Nicolas Winding Refn’s Bronson from 2008, which surely took some inspiration from Chopper. As for Bana himself, I said at the time that if he could do an American accent, he was all set. And that happened … kind of. Chopper was the dilithium crystal that powered the 20-year-plus career in movies and television that Eric Bana has gone on to have as a perfectly plausible lead in straight roles; some are interesting, but not like Chopper. I don’t think anything he has done has matched the toxic thrills and the hideous laughs he got as the scary joker and monstrous non-charmer. But why hasn’t Bana, evidently a great comic, gone more into film comedy? Did he think that comedy was something he’d outgrown? Did he want to avoid Chopper/larrikin typecasting? Maybe – and maybe the roles haven’t been there for him. A few years back, Bana was hinting at a return to standup – but still nothing. There’s still time, though. Well, who cares? Chopper is a great film. I still laugh when Chopper is utterly unconcerned at the first stabbing he receives in prison, merely inquiring mildly: “Bit early in the morning for kung fu, isn’t it?” There’s his dismissal of Keithy’s blood-splattered agony: “Whinge, whinge, fuckin’ whinge.” And then his lofty refusal to turn against his friend Jimmy for stabbing him – on grounds of loyalty: “If your mum stabbed you, you wouldn’t get upset …”  Chopper is released on 25 March in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Chopper review – Eric Bana’s star-making turn reeking with lairy charm and charisma,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/23/chopper-review-eric-banas-star-making-turn-reeking-with-lairy-charm-and-charisma
3/23/2022,"Joe’s Norfolk town might be an idyllic place. Marshes stretch to the sea, eels wriggle up creeks and oystercatchers stalk the mudflats. Here “mirrored pools … burst with sky”, and the tide “comes and goes, like one huge breath”, transforming water into land and land into water. Yet Ransom’s powerful debut is as bucolic as a fish hook through the cheek. Fishermen scrape a living near rusted tankers and burnt-out cars, the water below them “the same filthy grey” as the sky above. Feelings are bottled up and families strain with violence and resentment. Almost everything is old, battered or rotten. Prosperity and progress feel a long way away; the internet barely gets a mention. Joe is back after a sort-of escape – a spell working at a nearby fish and chip shop – looking for Tim, a red-haired charmer who is the love of his young life. But Tim has married a woman, Joe’s bullying father is in and out of hospital, and Joe’s head is a busy place. A river drowns out his thoughts, whispering of doubt and despair. He fixates on a sperm whale carcass he once saw on the beach, “bruise-coloured in beach-light”, and thinks of death. It does not take long to come. Ransom, who grew up in Norfolk, wrote the first draft of The Whale Tattoo on his phone on the bus. The result is a novel of fractured immediacy and growing menace that clings close to its protagonist and flits back and forth in time. Its focus on Joe and his shifting, watery thoughts – smoke is “blue”, hair “like wet sand” and Tim’s surname is Fysh – means that the supporting cast and plot take a while to coalesce. It’s testament to Ransom’s skill that The Whale Tattoo still grips throughout. He has a fine sense of place and a wonderful command of language, whether writing of flies “shiny with summer” or a rabbit’s “brown smudge against silvered marsh”. Ransom’s focus on the dreariness of Joe’s town makes moments of beauty precious; his exploration of inner life gives the sudden drama of public toilet trysts or boat-bound brawls a jolting physicality. As spring moves to summer, Joe acquires surprising allies and must choose between forgiveness and revenge. The Whale Tattoo is a book about trauma, but it’s also about healing, trust and a young man working his way through the gloom like a boat in sea mist. This eloquent, heartfelt debut pulls the reader right beside him, and announces Ransom as a writer of real talent.  The Whale Tattoo by Jon Ransom is published by Muswell (£9.99).

3/23/2022,"Fifteen years after he won the Pulitzer for his last novel The Road, it was confirmed earlier this month that Cormac McCarthy would be publishing two new books later this year. The first of the long-awaited novels is due out in October, allowing plenty of time to catch up or re-familiarise yourself with the great US author’s back catalogue. Booker-shortlisted novelist Chigozie Obioma, who has been a fan of McCarthy’s since picking up a copy of The Road from a friend’s shelf in 2010, suggests some good ways to start. The work of an eccentric writer such as McCarthy is best approached by reading the book that comes closest to being mainstream: All the Pretty Horses. The first of the Border Trilogy, it won McCarthy a national book award in 1992 and has been adapted into a popular film starring Matt Damon and Penélope Cruz. Set in the American south-west, it tells the story of two friends, John Grady and Lacey Rawlins, who decide to travel to Mexico and end up in trouble when they try to recapture a stolen horse. What makes the story more accessible than most of the author’s work is that McCarthy allows his characters to fully interact with each other. Grady even falls in love with a woman, who is both developed and alluring – a rarity in McCarthy’s fictional universe. McCarthy is intent on revealing the violence inherent in nearly every human endeavour. This is especially true in Blood Meridian, which is about a band of war veterans travelling through 19th-century America wreaking violence. Like much of McCarthy’s work, the novel is near-plotless, so its beauty lies in its acutely lyrical language, weaving a tapestry through landscape and characters. While Blood Meridian is widely considered McCarthy’s greatest work, The Road has been recognised as a classic in its own right, particularly within post-apocalyptic fiction. In the aftermath of an unexplained global catastrophe, an unnamed man and his son trek through the burnt landscape that was once America. The bleak, searing setting and relentlessly visceral language might seem like a journey into an impenetrable darkness, but this devastating, tender novel will speak straight to your heart. I think all McCarthy’s work is brilliant, but if you’re going to miss one out it should be the middle book of the Border Trilogy, The Crossing. While the language soars as ever, McCarthy’s gaze here is much narrower. Much of it revolves around the journey of Billy Parham, who is trying to cross the US-Mexican border with a wolf. The novel harbours environmentalist sentiments and is in some ways reminiscent of Jack London’s The Call of the Wild. But the story is not his most exciting, and Parham’s lack of interaction with other humans will test readers’ patience. Child of God has a classic McCarthyian plot: a degenerate, stripped of all familial relations and alone in the world, drifting. Lester Ballard’s story is told through a third-person impersonator – as I have come to refer to McCarthy’s narrators, since they break all conventions of the third-person narrator. It is this voice which pronounces Ballard, a character who kills and abuses the scant inhabitants of the forests of Appalachia, a “child of God”. There are acts here that would shock even the most ardent of McCarthy’s fans. Suttree, McCarthy’s fourth novel, is, in my opinion, one of the most artistically satisfying of the modern era. It focuses on the titular Suttree, a man who lives alone in a dilapidated houseboat on the Tennessee River, having abandoned his wife and son. He has no clear attachment to anything and the romantic relationships he pursues all end badly. McCarthy never allows his third-person narrator to delve into his characters’ psyches, instead presenting them through gestures. But it is through these gestures that we get a full image of a truly memorable character.  An Orchestra of Minorities by Chigozie Obioma is published by Abacus (£8.99).

3/23/2022,"Some food bank users are declining to accept products such as potatoes as they cannot afford the energy to boil them, the boss of the supermarket Iceland has said, as the soaring cost of living pushes vulnerable groups to the financial brink. Richard Walker, who says the 1,000-stores in the budget chain are in the “poorest communities in the UK”, also called on the government to help businesses that are being forced to increase prices significantly as their own costs dramatically increase. “I think the cost of living crisis is the single most important domestic issue we are facing as a country,” the Iceland managing director told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. “It is incredibly concerning. We are hearing of some food bank users declining products such as potatoes and other root veg because they can’t afford to boil them.” The cost of living continues to rapidly increase, with inflation rising to a three-decade high of 6.2% in February, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics, fuelled by the rising cost of petrol and diesel and a wide range of goods from food to toys and games. Annual food price inflation was 5.1%, the ONS said. Food prices rose by 0.9% between January and February – the largest monthly increase since 2012. Walker said that, in reality, the inflation on food was actually “pushing 10%”, and was already higher on items such as milk because of the cost of all the processes involved in producing it. He said that while some issues affecting inflation, such as supply shortages, would eventually ease, others would not, and, ultimately, the age of cheap food shopping in the UK might be over. “Systemically, if you look at it you could argue food has been too cheap for too long but [price increases] have to be matched in wages and productivity and everything in between,” he said. “We are doing everything we can, our customers are depending on us for that value, but of course the pressure is relentless and coming at us from all angles at the moment. We are not an endless sponge that can soak it all up.” Walker said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who is due to announce a mini budget in his spring statement on Wednesday, could alleviate the pressure on businesses and help consumers. He suggested the energy price cap on households could be extended to businesses, potentially paid for by a “windfall tax” on the rocketing profits of energy companies. That could mean an extra £100m saving on consumers, he said, pledging that Iceland “would pass on every penny”. Walker also said the government could perhaps delay the introduction of the increase in national insurance, and postpone the introduction of environmental taxes, which Walker said would cost Iceland £16m this year. “We have to focus on business as well because, ultimately, it is the consumer that is affected by the squeeze on cash and profits,” he said. The Iceland managing director said costs are rising across the entire supply chain from oil – which affects the price of all food products – to worker shortages, higher transportation costs and soaring electricity bills. He also pointed to factors including shortages in the supply of fertiliser from Russia, sunflower oil from Ukraine, and a £20m increase in the staff pay costs this year as the national minimum wage is raised.",News/Business,"Food bank users declining potatoes as cooking costs too high, says Iceland boss",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/23/food-bank-users-declining-potatoes-as-cooking-costs-too-high-says-iceland-boss
3/23/2022,"Good morning. Almost 100,000 people remain trapped in the ruined city of Mariupol, facing starvation amid “constant” Russian bombardment, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said, as he appealed for the release of a convoy he said had been captured by Russian forces. In a video address late last night, he renewed calls for Russia to allow safe humanitarian corridors, and said civilians faced “inhumane conditions. In a total siege. Without food, water, medication, under constant shelling and under constant bombing”. This morning, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said nine humanitarian corridors had been agreed, but Iryna Vereshchuk added that no agreement had been reached with Russia to establish a safe corridor from the heart of Mariupol. What has the UN said about the invasion? Its secretary general, António Guterres, has said it was time for Russia to end its “absurd” and “unwinnable” war in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters at the UN’s headquarters in New York, Guterres said the war was “going nowhere, fast”. How are negotiations going? Negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv have held several rounds of peace talks that have so far made little headway towards ending nearly four weeks of fighting What else is going on? Here’s what we know on day 28 of the invasion. Ketanji Brown Jackson gave a passionate defense of her sentencing of child sexual abuse imagery offenders as a rebuttal to Republican attacks that she has been unduly lenient in such cases, as her confirmation hearings for a seat on the US supreme court entered a critical second day. In the course of some rigorous questioning, Jackson strongly rejected claims that were first made last week by Josh Hawley, the Republican senator from Missouri. Hawley has spent several days advancing the theory that the Biden nominee, in her eight years as a federal district court judge, handed down sentences that were far more lenient than federal guidelines suggested or prosecutors requested. The accusations have been debunked as misleading and false. On Tuesday, Jackson gave a personal response to the claims. What did she say? “As a mother and a judge who has had to deal with these cases, nothing could be further from the truth,” Jackson said, adding that child abuse cases were among the most difficult she had dealt with as a judge, and described child sexual abuse imagery as a “sickening and egregious crime”. The US’s most powerful pro-Israel lobby group has been accused of putting support for Israel before American democracy after it declared its backing for the election campaigns of three dozen Republican members of Congress who tried to block President Biden’s presidential victory. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) has defended the move by saying that support for the Jewish state overrides other issues and that it is “no moment for the pro-Israel movement to become selective about its friends”. In December, Aipac launched a political action committee that enables it for the first time to spend money directly supporting congressional candidates in this year’s midterm elections. Earlier this month the committee released a list of 120 political endorsements that includes 37 Republicans who voted against certifying Biden’s victory following the 6 January 2021 storming of the Capitol. Who was on the list? Among them are two members of Congress, Jim Jordan and Scott Perry, who plotted with Trump’s White House to overturn the election result. Perry has also publicly promoted racist “white replacement” conspiracy theories. What’s the reaction been like? The lobby group’s move has been met by a storm of criticism, including from other pro-Israel organizations. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been accused of benefiting from the “blood, tears and sweat” of slaves as they arrived in Jamaica to be met by a protest calling for reparations from the British monarchy. William and Kate are said to be aware of the protests and the prince will address slavery in a speech. The spectre of Elizabeth Holmes loomed over the opening day of a trial that will determine whether Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, her former romantic and business partner at Theranos, was also her partner in crime. In opening statements, a prosecutor depicted Balwani as an instrumental accomplice. Even though only a small percentage of Walt Disney Co workers participated in a walkout yesterday, organizers felt they had won a moral victory with the company issuing a statement denouncing the anti-LGBTQ+ legislation (dubbed the “don’t say gay” bill) that sparked employee outrage. The Dutch publisher of a discredited cold case investigation into the betrayal of teenage Jewish diarist Anne Frank said it was recalling the book following a critical report on its findings. The Betrayal of Anne Frank: A Cold Case Investigation by Rosemary Sullivan has been widely criticised by experts. California counted 113,660 “unsheltered” people in 2020, making it home to more than half of all people without shelter in America and the only state where more than 70% of the homeless population is unsheltered (by comparison, just 5% of New York’s homeless population was unsheltered). The consequences of so many people living outside are severe and fatal. In a new series that will be published over the next several months, Guardian US will examine California’s homelessness crisis. Tamara Tunie is limbering up to play the vice-president of America in Mike Bartlett’s new political satire, The 47th. The Law & Order: SVU star is returning to the stage for the White House satire which finds Kamala Harris in 2024 in a world still dominated by the Trump family. Tunie talks to the Guardian about the “black-lash” after Obama’s election, brokering a new deal for Broadway diversity – and her role as Whitney Houston’s mum in the upcoming biopic I Wanna Dance With Somebody. An extreme heat event in the Arctic could cause it to reach the maximum of the extent of its ice for this year “considerably earlier” than usual, a scientist has warned. Temperature records were broken in Norway last week, with rain falling at Svalbard airport, and unusually warm temperatures recorded in Greenland and the Russian archipelago of Franz Josef Land. The American rapper Pusha T has issued an extraordinary attack on McDonald’s, releasing a diss track with a rival fast-food chain, Arby’s. The 75-second song was inspired, the rapper told Rolling Stone, by resentment over what he claims is McDonald’s failure to pay him and his brother properly for their part in writing and performing the famous I’m Lovin’ It jingle. “I’m the reason the whole world love it, now I gotta crush it,” he raps in the new track.
