1/23/2022,"The UK is past the worst of the Covid pandemic but should be braced for some “possible bumps on the road”, according to the scientist who helped shape Britain’s lockdown strategy. Prof Neil Ferguson, a leading epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said things were looking up as the country passed the peak of yet another wave of coronavirus infections.  “I am optimistic that the bulk of the pandemic, in terms of deaths and hospitalisations, is behind us. Though we should still be prepared for some possible bumps on the road,” he said, adding that any new variants – which were highly likely to arise – may have a less dramatic impact than Omicron. “The very high level of immunity in the UK population – acquired via both vaccination and infection – means that the risk of a new variant causing unmanageable levels of healthcare demand is much reduced,” he said. “An additional positive is that if any new variant arises from Omicron – not a certainty – there is a fair chance it will retain the reduced severity of that strain,” he added. Ferguson said a key development was Covid vaccines, in particular those based on mRNA technology, while important lessons had also been learned, such as the need for data to make informed decisions. “Compared with now, in March 2020 we were basically blundering around in the dark in terms of our real knowledge of how much infection was in the country.” Another lesson was the need to tailor the speed of policymaking to the speed of the virus. “That means in particular, you may have to make decisions before you have the full picture on severity,” he said. With Omicron spreading rapidly in the UK late last year, ministers were faced with a stark message from scientific advisers: to avoid the potential worst case scenarios, measures needed to be brought in quickly. But while the UK government introduced plan B in England, it resisted calls to go further, despite stronger measures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Ferguson said the political stance had evolved over time. “I think we’re in a different place, in terms of how policymakers think about this two years in than we were back in February, March of 2020,” he said, adding that the change had led to more nuanced and difficult decisions. On Wednesday, the prime minister announced that plan B measures in England would be lifted as cases were now falling. But Ferguson does not believe this will cause Omicron to come back in force. “Restrictions are always a trade-off between infection control and economic cost,” he said. “However, given that case numbers are in decline in all regions and that hospitalisations are starting to drop, I don’t think lifting restrictions poses a large risk of causing a major resurgence. Though obviously trends will need to continue to be monitored closely.” According to Ferguson, scientists rarely interact with politicians, with Sir Patrick Vallance and Sir Chris Whitty acting as mediators. But at times there were frustrations, such as in autumn 2020 when the Alpha variant took off. “Because then we were seeing case numbers go up. There was a lot of misinformation around frankly, at that point,” he said. Covid was evolving to become more transmissible and was not yet in a classic endemic disease scenario in the UK, he said. Flu mutated each year, and could cause seasonal epidemics, but the immunity we have acquired over our lifetimes meant it was manageable. And, as experts have noted, endemic does not necessarily mean mild. “[Covid] is going to become an endemic disease, which unfortunately kills people every year,” said Ferguson. But, with careful management and building immunity, he hoped waves of infection would bring a lower toll of hospitalisations and deaths – although it may be necessary to expand hospital bed capacity. But politicians have short memories, he said, and he worries that we may stop preparing for the next pandemic once the immediate shock of coronavirus starts to fade from the national consciousness. “I’m sure for the next 10 years, pandemic preparedness will be a top priority for governments, for research funders around the world,” Ferguson said. “What I worry about is in 15 or 20 years’ time, does that memory fade? That’s the real risk.”",News/World news,"UK is over worst of Covid, but beware of bumps on the road, says Prof Ferguson",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/covid-uk-over-worst-says-prof-neil-ferguson
1/23/2022,"Rishi Sunak is the Covid chancellor. Few outside of Westminster had heard of him when he replaced Sajid Javid in the role in early 2020, but since then he has spent two years in charge of the government’s economic response to the pandemic. Now, as restrictions are lifted, he is the bookies’ favourite to replace Boris Johnson if the prime minister is forced to quit over ‘partygate’. It is a meteoric rise. Since the second world war, only three former Conservative chancellors have made it to 10 Downing Street, and one of them, Winston Churchill, had left the Treasury more than a decade before the exceptional circumstances of 1940 won him the premiership.  Indeed, the list of postwar prime ministers Britain never had includes a long list of chancellors – both Conservative and Labour. Rab Butler, Roy Jenkins, Denis Healey and Ken Clarke were all big beasts that didn’t make it to the top job, suggesting the Treasury is not always the best government department to be running if you want to make and keep friends. In the early part of the pandemic, Sunak’s political stock rose as quickly as one of Wall Street’s must-have technology stocks. It wasn’t just that he seemed to know what he was doing; what he was doing – spraying the economy with money – was popular. Not many chancellors say money’s no object, which was Sunak’s message when the economy went into its first lockdown. In truth, he had no choice. Shutting people up in their homes in late March 2020 caused the economy to shrink by a quarter in just two months; without the furlough scheme and a variety of business support measures the damage would have been not just massive but permanent. There are times, normally when things are looking really bad, when the British state functions well – and this was one of them. Life has become tougher for the chancellor since those early months in the job. He was keen to end the furlough in the autumn of 2020 but was then forced to extend it in one of a series of mini-budgets. The eat-out-to-help-out scheme in August 2020 was a gimmick that may well have reseeded the virus. The stamp duty holiday for property was unnecessary and has helped fuel a house-price boom. Even so, the fact that unemployment is back to pre-pandemic levels and never reached the double-digit levels predicted by the Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility is a real achievement. Sunak had a good war, which explains why he is the frontrunner to replace Johnson. Peacetime brings its own set of challenges, though, especially for those who see themselves as the custodian of the nation’s finances. By the autumn of last year, it was no longer a case of “money no object” but rather a case of trying to reduce the government’s record deficit while providing scaled-back support for the economy. As a result, furlough came to an end, the £20-a-week uplift to universal credit was removed and it was announced that extra money for the NHS and social care should come from raising national insurance contributions. The first of these – winding up wage subsidies – was a gamble that paid off; the UC and NI changes look a lot less clever against a backdrop of soaring energy prices, inflation at 5.4% and falling real wages. It is never good news for governments when prices are rising faster than incomes, which is why Sunak – assuming he has not moved next door by then – will be stumping up extra money in his latest mini-budget on 23 March. So much has happened in the past two years that it is easy to forget this is still mid-term in the current parliament, a time when governments tend to be unpopular. Even if 2022 is the stinker it threatens to be, there is still time for the Conservatives to pull things round by the time of a 2024 election. By that time, the Bank of England expects inflation to be back close to 2%, there could be scope for tax cuts, and memories of Downing Street parties will be fading. The political calculation of those Tories who want Sunak to replace Johnson is that Labour’s opinion poll lead is a function of public unhappiness with the prime minister rather than any great affection for Sir Keir Starmer. That said, the longer Johnson clings on the worse it will be for the chancellor’s hopes of being the first Tory since John Major to move from 11 to 10 Downing Street. There is a lot of talk about the UK being on course for a period of 1970s-style stagflation (a period when the economy is stagnant and prices are rising rapidly) but it looks more likely that in 2022 there will first be a period of surging inflation and then a period of stagnation. Rising energy bills, higher taxes and falling real wages are all going to put the brakes on the economy in the second half of the year, and if Sunak is still chancellor he will be blamed. One of those who did move next door from 11 Downing Street, Gordon Brown, used to quip that there were only two sorts of chancellor: the ones who failed and the ones who got out in time. Looking at the prospects for the economy for the rest of this year, Brown’s advice would presumably be for Sunak to get out while the going is not too bad or risk being the political equivalent of the Omicron variant: someone who bursts on the scene, is everywhere for a while, but fades away just as quickly. Sunak is smart as well as ambitious. He has probably worked that out for himself.",News/Business,Sunak as PM?

1/23/2022,"Italian parliamentarians will begin casting their votes for a new president on Monday after scandal-plagued Silvio Berlusconi abandoned his dream of becoming the next head of state. More than 1,000 lawmakers and regional delegates will participate in the complex secret ballot, described as being akin to the appointment of a new pope, that could go through several rounds before a successor to Sergio Mattarella, who is due to step down on 3 February, is elected.  The winner of the seven-year mandate requires a two-thirds majority in the first three rounds of voting; from the fourth, an absolute majority is sufficient. Only on three occasions in the history of the election has a new president emerged in the first round. Berlusconi, who served Italy four times as prime minister, failed to garner enough support for his bid and in a heartfelt letter wrote that in the spirit of “national responsibility” he asked his backers to “give up” identifying him as a contender. Even though there are no official candidates in Italy’s presidential election, the 85-year-old broke from tradition and campaigned by calling up unaffiliated parliamentarians to tap them for votes, while augmenting his public persona by publishing full-page adverts in national newspapers highlighting personality traits and accomplishments that made him the best person for the job. His renouncement removed an obstacle to negotiations on a mutually agreeable candidate between the political party leaders. However, as of Sunday, no clear candidate had been named. Berlusconi, who leads Forza Italia, vetoed the endorsement of the current prime minister, Mario Draghi, arguing that the former European Central Bank chief must remain premier until the end of the legislature in 2023. Draghi, who has been credited with restoring stability in Italian politics, is seen as the frontrunner, even if broad support is not guaranteed over fears his move to the presidential palace could trigger early elections. The most crucial issue at stake is the Italian government’s adherence to the reforms that need to be enacted in order to secure instalments from the EU’s post-pandemic recovery fund, of which Italy is the biggest beneficiary. “With Draghi there’s not so much enthusiasm on behalf of all parties,” said a source from the centre-left Democratic party (PD). “The Five Star Movement fear it will lead to early elections, and some within the PD fear there could be a government in which they will lose their ministerial jobs.” Italy’s president is a largely ceremonial role, albeit with the power to resolve political crises, pick prime ministers, call early elections and approve or scrap laws. Mattarella was forced to step in several times to resolve crises, including calling on Draghi to form a unity government in February last year after the administration led by Giuseppe Conte collapsed. Draghi, 74, has neither confirmed nor denied his interest in becoming president. If elected, Vittorio Colao, the minister for technological innovation and a former Vodafone CEO, is reportedly being readied to replace Draghi as prime minister. “The problem is that it’s a bit complex to move Draghi out of the prime ministership and put him in the presidential palace, “ said Franco Pavoncello, a political science professor and the president of John Cabot University in Rome. “Here we have a star prime minister who is regarded as one of the big leaders of the western world. On the other hand, there is the sense that he might be more reassuring as president than as prime minister as long as he finds a good replacement, and that’s why the name of Colao is floating around.” Other possible contenders for the presidency include Pier Ferdinando Casini, a centrist senator who reportedly has good cross-party relations, Marta Cartabia, the justice minister, and Giuliano Amato, a former prime minister. Meanwhile, a faction of the Five Star Movement is pushing for Mattarella to stay on for another year. “Amato is a possibility because Berlusconi likes him, as do the whole of the centre-left,” said the PD source. “The difficulty is getting the rest of the rightwing to accept his name. Amato could be a compromise for Forza Italia, but maybe not the League.” Matteo Salvini, who leads the League, and his far-right ally Giorgia Meloni, the leader of Brothers of Italy, said they would not accept any more “vetoes from the left” following Berlusconi’s withdrawal from the race. However, neither the left nor the right holds enough power in parliament to call the shots, so the deadlock will need to be broken. Parliamentarians will vote once a day until a winner emerges.",News/World news,Secret ballot to elect president of Italy begins as Berlusconi drops out,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/italy-secret-ballot-president-berlusconi-drops-out
1/23/2022,"In her new memoir, I Came All This Way to Meet You, the American novelist Jami Attenberg describes meeting a man who is not on any social media at all, and who therefore has no idea what it’s like to receive a like or retweet. Attenberg considers this state wildly unusual, not to say bizarre; she’s all over Instagram and the rest. But her amazement is tempered with what sounds like envy. “You goddam beautiful unicorn,” she writes of him. “What’s that like, being entirely self-validating? What’s it like to wake up every day and not worry what anyone else thinks?” As it happens, I’ve spent the past 18 years of my life with just such a unicorn, though the man I’m talking about is – or was – an even rarer beast than hers. So, a guy isn’t on social media. So what? Lots of people aren’t. Facebook is for dinosaurs. The more important fact by far when it comes to my mythical creature is that, until three weeks ago, he did not, in a Britain in which around 87% of adults own a smartphone, even have a mobile. Not only had he never used social media, he had never sent, let alone received, a text. The exquisite torture that comes of WhatsApp and its blue ticks was entirely unknown to him, a man whose body is very far indeed from being hard-wired to respond to alerts. Nothing pinged in his pocket as he strolled along. When he was lost, he had to ask a stranger, not Google Maps. When he was out late, he had to rely on his legs, not an Uber. Calls? You’d be surprised. The last time he needed urgently to contact me while out and about, he walked into a hotel bar and, drawing on all of his great David Niven-like urbanity, casually asked a waiter if he might “use your telephone for a moment”.  Unsurprisingly, friends and strangers alike professed themselves astonished by this refusal to get with the programme (I mean the programme that involves being available 24 hours a day, seven days a week), their manner hovering between amusement and exasperation. Do you, people would ask sarcastically, still recite your number when you answer your landline? But I always found irritation the more interesting response, suggestive as it was of feelings of exclusion and hurt (“Don’t you want me to call you?”). Sometimes, it bordered on anger, a low-level rage that might possibly – I’m only guessing – have been connected to a sense of unfairness. While T had escaped the constant hassle, the stress and the surveillance, they had not, and never would. (Not that they would ever admit to this. Far too much – their entire existence! – was, is, at stake for that.) What about me, though? At some point, eyes would inevitably glide in my direction. Wasn’t I the long-suffering one! How did I cope? I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t sometimes annoying. A couple of months ago, I left a party before him only to find that I didn’t have my keys with me; I had to wait on the doorstep for an hour. I used to roll my eyes if he asked to use my phone, not least because I would then have to explain how to use it. “Useful, aren’t they?” I’d say, jaw clenched. But, like Attenberg, I was admiring, too. Such a refusal spoke of confidence and ease; in his stubbornness, he reminded me usefully of a past in which we all survived perfectly well without being contactable at any moment. His phone-less state also, I think, helped to maintain the privacy that is vital for peaceable coupledom. Even if I wanted to check up on him, I couldn’t, and he, in turn, had no interest in my phone because, well, phones were not something he cared about. I watched others being pestered by – or pestering – those closest to them and found that I was relieved to have been exempted from this regime, however unwillingly at first. But the biggest benefit of all was undoubtedly to him – and this is where envy sets in. All that extra time! When people asked how he managed to write so much – in the first lockdown, while I stared at my tiny screen, he began, and finished, his recent memoir – the answer was blindingly obvious. Unlike the rest of the world, he never wasted a single moment wondering why someone hadn’t answered his last message; nor did he indulge in doom or any other kind of scrolling. For his time to be his own, he required so little discipline. His in-between times were calm and quiet, to be used for good things like reading or listening to music. Mine were – they still are – punctuated by incoming fire I’m seemingly forbidden to ignore (“Didn’t you see my email?”). My phone has the capacity to make me deeply unhappy. But as you’ll have noticed, this piece is written in the past tense. At Christmas, T asked me to give him a phone and this I duly did, sneaking it into his stocking so as not to make too big a deal of it. What had penetrated his defences? I had told him a hundred times – usually as I printed out yet another boarding pass – that he was in danger of becoming disenfranchised in a world where the phone is the key to everything, and yet still he would not crack. In the end, there were two things. First, his beloved iPod was obsolete; he wanted to be able to use Spotify while he was running. Second, there was Covid, which requires so much paperwork, all of which is best kept on a mobile phone. Outwardly, I was triumphant. “It’s for the best,” I said, in the level voice I reserve for these situations. But inwardly, something else was going on. My goddam beautiful unicorn was about to disappear. When the Christmas post went to pot, and not one but two sim cards went missing, and the shiny new phone could not be used, there was no ignoring it: relief rose inside me. A stay of execution for us both. Soon after this, the sim having finally arrived, there came a moment when I found him in an armchair, AirPods in his ears, utterly absorbed in the black rectangle in his hand. For how much longer would he remain a free man? Never such innocence again, I thought, mournfully. But there is hope. Having spent all of his adult life phone-less, some rules have been set; some habits are hard to break. T is not your typical phone user, and perhaps he never will be. Only me and his sister have his number, and I’m forbidden to give it out to anyone else. The other night, a friend begged for it – the phone is the talk of our circle; everyone wants to be the first to break the long silence/ruin his life – and thumb screws having been applied, I relented. The friend sent a text, but there came no answer – not then, or for the rest of the evening. “It’s probably switched off,” I said. “What?” said the friend. “No one switches their phone off.” Hmm. When I got home, I inquired after the text that had been sent. Had T received it? He proffered his phone, showing me his reply, sent the following morning. “Automated message,” it read. “This number is no longer available.” It was very convincing; he’d added dashes to the words “automated message”, and somehow this made it look official. “I feel a bit guilty,” he said, shoving it in his pocket. But his face, which wore a smile, told a different story – of a phone that is not quite a phone. Or not yet. People were often incredulous that I’d never had a mobile. They talked to me about it as if I were missing a limb or afflicted with a serious illness. But it truly wasn’t that difficult to live without one. Thirty years ago nearly everybody did, and life was fine. Why, though? I suppose because I never wanted one. From the outside, looking in, I noticed the way mobiles changed everyday behaviour. Insidiously, the sleek pocket devil became what a pack of cigarettes was to a previous generation: something to occupy your hand, hugely antisocial, bad for your health. At some point it became acceptable to interrupt a conversation by raising a finger and saying, “I just need to take this”; to place your phone on a dinner table and check your incoming, surreptitiously or not; to stalk along a pavement, head down, eyes absorbed by your screen (so I have to step out of the way for you?). I travel mostly by bus, which used to be a good place to daydream, to mooch, to worry about the next chapter of my book. Solitary mooching must be a cornerstone of any civilised society. Alas, the upstairs deck is now a bedlam of jabberers, droners, performative monologuists. The dream was over after the pandemic. It no longer felt viable – or fair to Rachel – to have someone nannying me with NHS apps and Covid passes on a phone that wasn’t mine. It’s not all bad. No more trouble over entry at galleries, theatres, football stadiums. And I have Spotify when I go for a run – genius. For the rest, though, I’m hoping to maintain a low block on access. I don’t intend to give out my number. Email is the saviour. Honestly, I love my friends! I just don’t want them to call me – ever.

1/23/2022,"Rolling Stone journalist Jason Fine is driving around southern California. Beach Boy Brian Wilson is in the passenger seat. A camera mounted on the dashboard observes as they play Wilson’s back catalogue through the car’s speakers. Wilson doesn’t like interviews. Formally diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, the singer-songwriter and producer has survived addiction, family loss and an abusive relationship with a quack doctor. It’s no wonder he’s reluctant to rehash the details of his life. The gentle approach taken by director Brent Wilson and co-writer Fine here shows they are keenly aware of their subject’s vulnerability, less interested in extracting anecdotes than they are creating a safe space for the 79-year-old to reflect on his remarkable legacy. Archive footage of a round-faced, 22-year-old Wilson flirting with a newsreader makes for a poignant contrast with the artist today. Still, there remains something boyish about the septuagenarian. Cultural context is provided by celebrity talking heads including Elton John and Bruce Springsteen. Linda Perry, formerly of 4 Non Blondes, is the film’s sole female contributor, and its most insightful too. “You can tell this man is troubled, and trying to escape something,” she says.

1/23/2022,"The big idea in Femi Elufowoju Jr’s reading of Rigoletto for Opera North is so powerful and so current and at the same time so true to the artistic force of Verdi’s setting of Victor Hugo that it is somehow surprising that it has taken until now for someone to put it on the stage. Elufowoju Jr’s production rediscovers the otherness of Rigoletto and his daughter Gilda for the 21st century. In Hugo and Verdi, the title role is a 16th-century hunchback court jester, who keeps his daughter hidden away to protect her from philandering aristocrats. Here, however, Rigoletto’s otherness is as a black man with a vulnerable daughter existing on the margins of an entitled bunch of rich white party animals who cannot be trusted around young women. Sound familiar? The political topicality is never explicitly stated, but it gives the idea searing extra credibility.  Believe me, this new take on Rigoletto really works. It does so, in the main, because of the two black artists – Eric Greene as Rigoletto and Jasmine Habersham as Gilda – who don’t just inhabit their demanding roles vocally, Habersham in particular, but who constantly convey how everything in their lives is precarious, with danger (and excitement) lurking literally just outside the door. All this is elevated by the luxury casting of Willard White as Count Monterone, dressed in a shining agbada, who curses the corrupt court, and – crucially for the drama that unfolds – curses Rigoletto’s collusive involvement with it. It is important to say that not everything about this conception of Verdi’s opera comes off. The revelatory impulse of this production sometimes struggles to make its point. There is some overly fussy stagecraft. A pantomime setting, in which an infantilised Gilda, guarded by a pistol-packing chaperone, sleeps on a stuffed zebra exemplifies the show’s occasional overstatement. And the final act confirms the rule that sticking a car on the stage is generally more hindrance than help. Overall, though, Opera North achieves its customarily high musical standards. Garry Walker conducts very idiomatically, and the wind writing, in which Verdi achieved such breakthroughs, is particularly well played. Roman Arndt is a stylish Duke of Mantua, delivering his big numbers reliably, and Callum Thorpe a chillingly excellent Sparafucile. Greene is a light-voiced Rigoletto, and his Italian diction could do with more rasp, but the warmth of his singing is beguiling. It’s Habersham, though, who provides most of the special moments, not just in her big scenes but in the ensembles that are such a notable feature of this opera. Rigoletto is at Grand theatre, Leeds, until 19 February, then touring until 1 April.

1/23/2022,"England captain Heather Knight has said that her side will be going all out to win the Ashes Test in Canberra, after consecutive wash-outs in the second and third T20s at Adelaide left both sides frustrated at the lack of opportunity to get early points on the board in the series.  Australia won the first match by nine wickets but the second game on Saturday was called off after 4.1 overs, while Sunday’s final T20 was abandoned without a ball being bowled. The series scoreline stands at 4-2 to Australia, and with the Test worth four points, a win is crucial to England’s hopes of regaining the Ashes. “It’s been a very frustrating couple of days,” Knight said. “We didn’t have the chance to try and get back in the series with the two games. With Test match cricket you have to earn the right to be aggressive. It’s about getting ready mentally. We’ll sit down as a group and try and work out the best strategy to try to win us the game and take that four points. If we can get a win in the Test match, it puts us in a strong position going into the ODIs.” Knight also spoke on how reserve days should be introduced into the Women’s Ashes schedule and repeated her call for five-day Tests. “I’ve been pretty clear that when you play Test matches so rarely, it should be at least five days,” continued Knight. But the Test is obviously going to be four. If we lose a day to rain - or even half a day - we’ve seen how hard it is in previous Test matches to force a result.” England’s last visit to Australia – for the T20 World Cup in 2020 – was also hit by rain, with a semi-final washout controversially ending their tournament due to a lack of contingency options in the playing conditions. “I think reserve days in Ashes and World Cups would be very useful,” Knight said. “It would be useful if they could be worked in and potentially a five-day Test match would make things better for everyone, the players, the viewers, and make sure you don’t miss the contest that you want to see. In a hotly-contested series that might be tight, you don’t want the weather to be the main story, do you? I’d be open to looking at different things.” Australian morale has been dented by the news that fast bowler Tayla Vlaeminck will miss the remainder of the Ashes and the World Cup in New Zealand with a stress fracture in her right foot – a recurrence of the injury which kept her out of the 2020 T20 World Cup. “It was a pretty quiet changing room when we found out the news last night,” teammate Rachael Haynes said. “We’re so disappointed for her.” In happier news, Australia coach Matthew Mott confirmed that Beth Mooney would be returning to the squad for the remainder of the series. Mooney, who only days ago underwent surgery to mend the fracture in her jaw, was spotted at the Adelaide Oval jogging around the outfield and has been described by Mott as looking “in good nick”. “It’s pretty incredible,” Haynes added. “The swelling around her face has gone down quite substantially and she’s feeling really confident. She had a hit today in the nets and a run around and by all accounts she’s not in any pain. Without a doubt she’s definitely got her eye on [playing in] that Test match.” Both teams fly to Canberra on Monday and will immediately commence preparations for the Test, which begins on Thursday.",Sport/Sport,‘Frustrating’: England’s Knight looks to Canberra Test after Ashes T20 washout,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/23/frustrating-england-australia-heather-knight-canberra-test-ashes-t20-washout
1/23/2022,"Dominic Raab has refused to confirm that the Sue Gray report into alleged Downing Street parties will be published in full next week, saying that the amount of detail released publicly would be a matter for Boris Johnson. In what appeared to be a scaling back of the government’s commitment to openness on the report, Raab, the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, promised there would be “full transparency”, but declined to give any specifics.  Gray, the senior civil servant tasked with investigating claims of lockdown-breaking parties at Downing Street and elsewhere in government, is expected to publish the report in the coming week. Asked whether the public would be able to see it in full, Raab told BBC One’s Sunday Morning programme: “Quite the way the process for it will be for the prime minister to decide. But there will be full transparency. He has said he will come back to the Commons and make a statement, so there will be full scrutiny.” Pressed on whether this meant it would be fully published, Raab said: “I’m not quite sure the shape and the form it will come, but the prime minister has been clear there will be full transparency around this, so that people can see. We welcome that transparency, we need to learn lessons.” It has been reported that Gray’s investigation has been expanded to consider claims that Johnson and his wife, Carrie, held parties in their flat above 11 Downing Street. According to the Sunday Times, Gray is looking into whether visits to the flat amid lockdown by government aides who are close friends with Carrie Johnson were necessary for work. Raab declined to say whether Gray was looking into this, but did agree that Johnson would be expected to resign if he had misled parliament over the issue of parties. “The whole point of Sue Gray conducting this investigation is that she can look without fear or favour at whatever she wants to look at, and we avoid trial by media or the soap opera of things coming out without being substantiated,” Raab said when asked about the new claims. “What I would say in relation to any of this is, if it’s significant, it’s important, Sue Gray should look at it.” Asked if Johnson should go if parties in the flat did happen, Raab said he would not answer “hypothetical questions”, but added: “We’ve been clear that the ministerial code of conduct is there for everyone, including the prime minister.” Quizzed on whether Johnson would have to go if he lied to the Commons, he said: “The code of conduct for ministers is very clear, that if you mislead parliament it’s a resigning matter.” Speaking earlier, the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown said it seemed unlikely that Johnson’s career would “end in anything other than scandal”. “My fear is that scandal is going to follow Boris Johnson as long as he is prime minister,” Brown told Sky’s Trevor Phillips On Sunday. “We don’t just have the scandal – and all the details will probably come out later this week about partying – we have the conflicts of interest, we have the dubious appointments, we have foreign money and question marks over that, who is paying the bills for what? And I don’t think we are going to see this administration end in anything other than scandal.”",News/Politics,Dominic Raab refuses to confirm full publication of Sue Gray partygate report,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/23/sue-gray-partygate-report-dominic-raab
1/23/2022,"The title of Jean-Daniel Broussé’s solo show is a pun on the French word for bread and, of course, the English word for suffering. Over 55 minutes, Broussé – or JD, as he calls himself – gives a practical demonstration of how to make baguettes while sharing the pain of having to choose between continuing the family business or becoming a performer. A batch of lively scenes, devised and developed by JD with director Ursula Martinez, deploy dance, music, film and acrobatics to tell the story, in this fourth-ever performance (not all are oven-ready). JD comes from a line of bakers. His father, grandfather and great-grandfather ran a boulangerie in the south of France. Donning an apron, he mixes his ingredients: “1kg patriarchy, 750ml Christian values, 70g sentimentality, 20g small-town mindset”. As a voiceover narrates the process by which dough is formed, JD climbs into a white, stretchy, fabric sack, Martha Graham-style, and mimes being kneaded, thrown, twisted, turned. The making of bread as a metaphor for the shaping of a life is unforced and very funny.  We are introduced to the area where JD grew up, its dances and customs (he delivers a tale in the regional language Occitan to his own bagpipe accompaniment). On screen, his mother gleefully sings a scabrous lyric she devised to describe past dissatisfactions with her life; his father, packing up the business his son will not carry on, philosophically contrasts endings and beginnings. We meet the doctor who diagnoses JD’s gluten intolerance – the rejector rejected. The darker side of JD’s experiences, as a queer man in a small town, is suggested in his mischievous comparisons between himself and Jesus – naughty, but nicely done. This comparison is implicit also in the conclusion. JD invites the audience to eat the six loaves baked in his on-stage oven; his sharing of self through performance is also a celebration of our communality. The bread tastes good. This performance was part of the London international mime festival, which runs until Sunday 6 February.

1/23/2022,"Teenage girls are taken seriously in Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige’s lively coming-of-age drama. In Montreal, a blizzard rages as Alex (Paloma Vauthier) pores over her mother Maia’s “memory box”, a trove of correspondence from her youth in 1980s Beirut. Notebooks, photographs and cassette tapes form a self-portrait of Maia’s adolescence, detailing her vices (smoking), secret boyfriends (“Raja”) and favourite songs (Fade to Grey by Visage). They are also a portal to her memories of the Lebanese civil war, a painful experience she has chosen not to share with her daughter. Hadjithomas and Joreige thoughtfully explore trauma while remaining joyful, animating Maia’s photos, which fizz, crackle and dance to life on screen.
