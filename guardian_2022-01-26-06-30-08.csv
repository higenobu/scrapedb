1/26/2022,"About 150 yards from the turnstiles at the Olembe Stadium stands a plain white-painted metal fence. There are Vs at the top of the posts for the addition of barbed wire, but none has been added. There are three gates in the fence, but only the left-hand one was open on Monday night. Separating it from the central gate was a temporary barrier. On Tuesday, it lay flat, buckled over a kerb by the side of a road, flattened by thousands of feet. It was there, during Cameroon’s Africa Cup of Nations last-16 victory over Comoros, that eight people died and a further 38 were injured.  An attempt has been made to clear up but inside the left-hand gate and on the avenue leading up to the South Stand, debris remains. There are shards of broken vuvuzelas, a sandal and a shoe, a pair of broken sunglasses and the shattered lens from another. An advertising banner lies twisted on the dusty concrete, wrenched in the chaos from its kiosk. Eyewitnesses say that, as they left the game on Monday, there were dozens of shoes and broken vuvuzelas in this area. It appears that several thousand fans approached the stadium from the south and were funnelled up a broad avenue towards Covid-testing tents and security checks. About 20 yards beyond security, across the road, is the fence. It seems that in the minutes leading up to kick-off, at 8pm, the area became crowded and fans began to push towards the open left-hand gate. “There were only 10 or 20 police officers for about 1,000 people – it was not enough,” said Romaric, a fan who attended the match with his fiancee. “I clearly heard one of them say that the stand was full, that they should start locking the gates.” That was at 7.50pm and, with the bottleneck building, officers began advising fans to walk to the less busy entrances on other sides of the ground. “Policemen were telling everyone that other gates were open but many wanted to take the shortest route rather than go round,” Romaric said. “We kept moving and walked to the entrance that was the most free.” Video footage shows fans climbing the fence even then, even if the area does not seem unduly full. But at kick-off there was a surge, crushing fans against the fence, although doctors at the Centre des Urgences de Yaoundé (Cury) said most of the injuries they had seen had been caused by fans being trampled upon. “Everybody wanted to get into the match and it caused people to start forcing their way in, treading over others,” said Dr Diana Bikele, one of the medics at Cury. She and her colleagues treated four severely injured patients and two who were moderately hurt. The casualties had initially been taken to the Messassi hospital, a few minutes from Olembe, but by 4am most had been moved to specialist facilities such as Cury. Few inside the stadium realised anything untoward had happened. Romaric joined everyone else in watching Cameroon edge through, departing soon after Vincent Aboubakar scored their second goal in the 70th minute. “We went out and realised there were a lot of people covered in dust, as if they’d been in an accident,” he said. He was told people had died. The Guardian has seen photographs of seven of the eight who lost their lives. At least two were women and at least two children. One was said to be 14; the other looked a lot younger. Footprints are clearly visible on the vest of one man. “I asked one woman who had dirt all over her body: ‘What happened? Why did people have to die?’” Romaric said. “She told me: ‘People were pushing each other, pushing everywhere trying to enter.’ Some fell and were trampled on; that’s how some of them died on the spot and others were injured.” The fence was not there three months ago but, along with the road behind the security tents, was part of the infrastructure added in late November after the Confederation of African Football (Caf) threatened to move games from Olembe. Tragically, the decision to install it appears to have been a key factor among several that caused the disaster. “Some of the people came just to be part of the atmosphere,” the president of Caf, Patrice Motsepe, said in a hastily convened press conference on Tuesday. “Including those who didn’t have tickets, so I think we do accept that thousands of people more than what was expected did arrive.” He acknowledged that a gate “was closed for inexplicable reasons. If that gate was open as it was supposed to, we wouldn’t have had this problem we have now, this loss of life.” Covid restrictions mean the stadiums are only supposed to be 80% full for games featuring the hosts but with fans not allocated to specific parts of the ground, let alone specific seats, the south end, nearest the centre of town, was dangerously full. “When the second goal went in and everybody was celebrating, I saw one person near me who was almost dead,” said Francis, a salesman for a print company. That may or may not have been the 20-year-old male who was admitted to Cury on Monday night. Sitting up in his hospital bed the following afternoon, he said he remembered falling and feeling “a pressure on my chest” after Aboubakar’s goal. He was unconscious at the triage centre at the stadium for between 45 minutes and an hour before being sent to Cury. On Tuesday afternoon, he was one of only two from the initial half-dozen admissions not to have been discharged. To his right lay Salomon, who required a number of tests and received intravenous treatment after being caught in the crush. “I went to support my team, the game had started there were many fans at the gate and they surged,” he said. “I fell down, just like that, and people trampled over me.” There are suggestions that an incident like this had only narrowly been averted during at least one of the three group-stage games played at Olembe. One eyewitness at Cameroon’s draw with Cape Verde said security personnel had appeared to lose control there, with the stands eventually becoming hazardously packed in places. Sunday’s quarter-final between the winners of Wednesday’s Ivory Coast v Egypt tie and Morocco has been moved from Olembe to the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium in Yaoundé. Although renovated in 2016, that is a creaking old ground with a capacity of 42,000 and harbours its own question marks. Its gates were shut early at an Africa Women’s Cup of Nations match six years ago, with fans reporting being trampled on in the resulting crush. On that occasion the consequences were less serious. Sunday’s fixture is unlikely to pose major problems but a semi-final and final involving Cameroon are a different matter. It remains to be seen whether Olembe, with its 60,000 capacity, can be made safe for those games. Another alternative venue, the Japoma Stadium in Douala, has significant problems with its pitch and is unlikely to take any extra workload. “There must be a committee that’s set up to immediately investigate what happened and in that context to find out who was supposed to do what and who did not do and perform their responsibilities,” said Motsepe. “We want that report by Friday. My duty is always to not just take responsible steps but also I am more inclined to be as conservative as possible to put measures in place that minimises the loss of life.” The Cup of Nations will go on, and both Caf and the local organisers have significant questions to answer. The Olembe Stadium was built at a reported cost of about $300m (£222m) and was supposed to be the centrepiece of a tournament Cameroon has been waiting to host again for 50 years. Inside it is magnificent, but for now it stands as a vast cenotaph to the eight fans. The broken vuvuzelas may be swept up, but the memories will not be.",Sport/Football,‘Why did people have to die?’: Cameroon mourns after stadium tragedy,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/25/why-did-people-have-to-die-cameroon-mourns-after-stadium-tragedy

1/26/2022,"For weeks now, it has seemed, just about every question to a minister has met the same response: we need to wait for the Gray report. Its publication is now seemingly imminent – so what is the report, and what might it find?  It is an investigation into allegations of lockdown-breaching parties inside Downing Street and more widely in government, ordered by No 10 in December and carried out by the Cabinet Office. The probe was originally led by Simon Case, the cabinet secretary – the UK’s most senior civil servant – but he stepped down soon after the process began, after reports his office also held a social event. Sue Gray took over. Another senior civil servant – her official job is second permanent secretary at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. The title, however, belies her status and reputation. A longtime civil servant, who once ran a pub in Newry with her country and western singer husband, Gray spent years heading the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team, in charge of investigating alleged breaches of discipline, including by ministers. The initial remit handed to Case was to look at two alleged events at No 10 in the winter of 2020 – on 27 November and 18 December – and one in the Department for Education on 10 December 2020. But the terms of reference, kept under Gray, add: “Where there are credible allegations relating to other gatherings, these may be investigated.” Many more other claims have been added. Most recently, these include allegations of a party in Boris Johnson’s private Downing Street flat, and of a birthday party for the PM. Gray and her team were promised access to “all relevant records” and could speak to members of staff. While it has no judicial status, meaning Gray has no powers to compel non-staff members to talk or submit evidence, some have, such as Johnson’s former chief aide, Dominic Cummings, and police officers who were on duty. The main purpose, as set out in the terms of reference, is “to establish swiftly a general understanding of the nature of the gatherings, including attendance, the setting and the purpose”. It adds: “If required, the investigations will establish whether individual disciplinary action is warranted.” If there is any evidence of potential criminality, this can be passed to the Metropolitan police – as has happened. No. If she were to recommend disciplinary action against civil servants or political advisers, the expectation is that this would take place, using normal HR procedures. But ministers are only held accountable to the ministerial code, which is ultimately enforced by the prime minister. In theory it is possible, but this does not seem likely. To do so would effectively end the prime minister’s career, and as a civil servant, however senior and influential, this would seem well beyond Gray’s remit. It is, however, very possible that the sheer weight of facts laid out could make Johnson’s position untenable. Time will tell. Only Gray knows for certain, although it is understood to be completed, so this could happen as early as Wednesday. There was a brief assumption that the police investigation could delay this for weeks, but the Met have made clear they are happy for the report to come immediately. That does not seem likely. When Johnson announced the Case inquiry he told MPs that a copy of Case’s full report would be put in the library of the House of Commons. But the terms of reference say only: “The findings of the investigations will be made public.” In recent days, ministers have talked only of the findings being published, with Johnson deciding how complete this is. It could be as little as a précis of a couple of pages, or could be notably more. Ministers have said that as soon as it is out, Johnson will want to make a statement to the Commons and take questions. This is seemingly to try to allow the PM to set out the narrative of what it finds. However, MPs, journalists and others will also be reading it – and coming to their own conclusions.",News/Politics,What is the Gray report investigating and what happens when it’s published?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/25/what-is-the-gray-report-investigating-and-what-happens-when-its-published
1/26/2022,"Boris Johnson is braced for the most perilous 48 hours of his premiership, with exasperated Conservative MPs due to see an official report into Downing Street parties that has now triggered a criminal inquiry. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, announced on Tuesday that her officers are investigating allegations of law-breaking at the heart of government on the basis of evidence unearthed during an inquiry by the senior civil servant Sue Gray.  In what appeared to be a hint about what Gray has discovered, Dick said: “I don’t anticipate any difficulty in obtaining the evidence that it is … necessary, proportionate and appropriate for us to obtain in order to get to the right conclusions”. Those found to have breached regulations could be fined. Former No 10 staffers told the Guardian that the police inquiry will uncover evidence which has not yet been submitted to Gray. One senior Tory said the Scotland Yard inquiry was a “different ballgame”, adding: “Officials who don’t tell Sue Gray the whole truth will not hold back from the cops.” Downing Street sources refused to be drawn tonight on whether the prime minister could give the green light for the report to be released as soon as Wednesday, but it is certainly expected within days. A senior government source cautioned it was unlikely to be published in full, saying: “You don’t need to be a lawyer to realise that if there’s an ongoing police investigation, there are constraints on what you can publish.” Gray has interviewed witnesses and examined key evidence including security logs showing who was in Downing Street and when. She is also thought to have been shown photographs of parties though Cabinet Office sources stressed these were unlikely to be included in the report. It is understood the Met’s decision to investigate a number of parties in Downing Street and Whitehall was made on Sunday. Johnson had been informed in advance but opted not to tell his cabinet at their weekly meeting on Tuesday, leaving them to find out as they emerged and triggering consternation. Asked why cabinet ministers were not told, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: “From what I understand it’s important not to pre-empt a police statement on this sort of issue at any point.” Many Tory MPs are awaiting Gray’s findings before deciding whether to add their names to those calling on the 1922 Committee chair, Graham Brady, to trigger a vote of no confidence. One senior MP suggested Tory backbenchers would be likely to come to a “collective decision” when they see how Johnson responds. “Those colleagues that still have a foot in the real world will recognise that there is no world in which a police investigation is anything but very bad,” they said, adding that in any normal workplace those under investigation would be suspended rather than coming to work as normal. A former cabinet minister suggested Brady may already have received 40 letters. The threshold for triggering a confidence vote is 54. If it is reached, a vote would be held within days, and if Johnson lost it, his premiership would effectively be over. His press secretary insisted last week that Johnson would be determined to fight any vote of no confidence, rather than resign. The prime minister continued to adopt a defiant stance on Tuesday, briefing MPs on the crisis in Ukraine and entertaining wavering colleagues at No 10. “I welcome the Met’s decision to conduct its own investigation because I believe this will help to give the public the clarity it needs and help to draw a line under matters,” he told the House of Commons. His spokesman, asked whether Johnson believed he had broken the law, said: “It’s fair to say he does not.” At cabinet, Johnson hailed the benefits of Brexit and urged his colleagues to be “bold” and “go further and faster in driving forward the government’s reform agenda”. One backbencher said Johnson’s team “have been working hard” in winning over MPs tempted to call for his removal, saying they had been trying to “charm” backbenchers. Another pointed to an “atmosphere of intimidation”, however, after a series of reports in recent days about the heavy-handed tactics of Johnson’s whips and other close allies. On a day of twists and turns at Westminster, it initially appeared the Met’s inquiry would delay publication of Gray’s report. Johnson’s spokesman subsequently suggested just those aspects of the report unrelated to the parties being investigated by the police could be released. “My understanding is that she can publish those elements that are not subject to further work,” he said. But it later emerged the Met had no objections to the report’s publication. Tory MPs lined up to defend the prime minister during an urgent question on the investigation by Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner. The Conservative MP Giles Watling described the urgent question as a “vexatious waste of everybody’s time” but was forced to withdraw his claims by the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who decides urgent questions. Sir Edward Leigh said: “When Europe stands on the brink of war and there is a cost of living crisis can we please have a sense of proportion over the prime minister being given a piece of cake in his own office by his own staff.” The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said later: “A sitting prime minister is under police investigation. If he had a scrap of shame, he’d resign. He thinks he’s above the law – but he’s not. And it’s time for him to go.” On Monday ITV News reported that up to 30 staff gathered in the Downing Street cabinet room in June 2020 with a cake and picnic food from Marks & Spencer to sing Happy Birthday to the prime minister and give him birthday cake. The event, which No 10 has denied was a party, was said to have been organised by his wife, Carrie, and briefly attended by the interior designer Lulu Lytle. Seeking to defend Johnson against that allegation on Tuesday evening, one of his close confidants, Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns, claimed the prime minister had been “in a sense, ambushed with a cake”.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson braced for perilous 48 hours with release of Sue Gray’s report,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/25/boris-johnson-braced-for-perilous-48-hours-with-release-of-sue-grays-report
1/26/2022,"“The other thing in the diversity bit is the football and rugby worlds become much more attractive to the Afro-Caribbean community. In terms of the south Asian community, we find that they do not want to commit the time that is necessary to get to the next step. They prefer to go into educational fields.” “I know one Caribbean overseas player … who termed himself ‘Token’, so there was a degree of humour in it … It’s difficult to call it offensive.”  “We have a women’s section.” “We have a full-time female physiotherapist.” “I had dinner with Desmond Haynes recently.” Thank you gentlemen. Thanks for coming. Thank you for shedding an entirely unintended shard of light. In decades to come, as future historians of what was once the national summer sport come to pick over those jealously tended ashes, trying to understand how English cricket fostered its self-sabotaging culture of exclusion, they would do well to examine the contents of Tuesday morning’s hearing before the digital, culture, media and sport select committee into how the county game hopes to address the problems around diversity and reach identified by Azeem Rafiq and others in the last year. Called to give evidence, Mike O’Farrell and Rod Bransgrove, the chairmen of Middlesex and Hampshire, dished up a performance that was often tin-eared, frequently painful, at times verging on parody; but always unintentionally illuminating. There were some good intentions here and some fine words, mixed in with the dreadful, elbow-gnawing ones. Mainly, what the men in the committee chamber told us was exactly why English cricket is in trouble: because people like this are in charge. The most notable moment came as O’Farrell tried to explain why black and south Asian cricketers don’t progress through his county’s academy to the first team. His comments, quoted at the top of this page, sparked a spasm of digital disbelief. They were subsequently retracted and “clarified”, where “clarified” means using completely different words to describe a totally different idea. Which is at least a step up on saying the unsayable thing out loud by mistake. It was a moment of genuine double take. Here we had the chairman of a professional county in one of the largest and most diverse catchments appearing to state, with a reassuring smile, that the problem is black people just don’t like cricket; and that Asian people are interested in schoolwork and therefore not committed enough. Where to start with this? Most obviously, it involves taking a trite observation and spinning it out into generalised gibberish. The popularity of football isn’t pigment-specific. Neither is wanting to do well in school. But these are tropes that are often trotted out around cricket, pub-chat nonsense that becomes genuinely restrictive, the blanket dismissal of an entire slice of humanity, when it is being trotted out by the head of a pathway that goes down to age 11. Ask yourself, Mike, exactly why some of those kids might prefer to get an education. Perhaps the most significant element was that nobody in the parliamentary committee room batted an eyelid. Presented with some entry-level stereotypes, literally the exact thing they were there to dissect, a room full of MPs and cricket chairmen just waved it through. These are people in positions where there is a duty to be informed, to understand how talent is shut down and opportunity denied. There it is, right in front of you, speaking into the mic. Nobody present heard a false note. Within a couple of hours Middlesex had issued a formal rebuttal. “I wholly accept that this misunderstanding is entirely down to my own lack of clarity … I was aiming to make the point that as a game, cricket has failed a generation of young cricketers,” O’Farrell said. And to be fair he did make exactly that point. Just not in the way he intended. On balance Bransgrove of Hampshire had an even more haphazard time in front of the cameras. His first act was to deny he had recently told a gathering of county chairmen that he understood racism because he was a 60-year-old white man, and that the real problem is people have “forgotten the worth of the white man”. Ah. Some potential problems there, Rod. Bransgrove said it was “absolute nonsense” to suggest he would ever say this. Perhaps by way of example, he proceeded to offer up some absolute nonsense of his own, including but not limited to the anecdote about “Token”, a story that seemed to make him feel good, as opposed to ashamed and uneasy. At one point Bransgrove said: “I don’t know how a streaker runs across the pitch. If you did that in public you’d be on the sex offender list.” Rod: thanks for that. A bit later he suggested that one of the best things about cricket is you don’t need height or muscle mass, and as a result is also open to “disadvantaged people”, who perhaps in his mind seem to live in Dickensian squalor drinking rainwater and eating toenails. It was Rod who had dinner with Desmond Haynes. His favourite cricketer no doubt. Along with Mr Gordon Greenidge. It is of course easy to laugh, without humour or pleasure, at the clueless executives, charged with overseeing cricket’s farrago of structural problems. And while we should still laugh at the clueless executives, it was the afternoon session at the DCMS committee that provided the more pertinent action. Tom Harrison, the ECB’s chief executive, had been unctuous and slightly harried at the initial DCMS committee hearing in November. Here he came tooled up with slogans, numbers and mission statements, a marketing man with his pitch down pat. Harrison began by saying that everything in his seven years at the head of English cricket had been geared towards growing the game, and that the Rafiq affair had only given extra impetus to his reforming zeal. Both of these statements are demonstrably false. Harrison has overseen a continued shrinking back of the summer game. He also had prior knowledge of Rafiq’s complaint but only began to act or make any comment when public opinion left him no option. But hey! Why spoil a good line? There is now a hard edge to these concerns. A quarter of a century after the first alarming report into systemic racism was delivered to the ECB, and after decades of window dressing, the DCMS committee has suggested future public funding might be dependent on the ECB showing it is making tangible efforts to remove barriers to entry and progress. Nothing will be resolved by these televised talking shops. But by providing a stage for the ECB’s slick corporate deflections, for the half-formed thoughts of the county chairmen, they do at least tell us one thing. It’s pretty obvious where the problem lies.",Sport/Sport,Tin-eared county chairmen show why English cricket is in trouble | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/25/tin-eared-county-chairmen-show-why-english-cricket-is-in-trouble
