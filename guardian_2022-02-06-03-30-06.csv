2/6/2022,"You can tell there’s a World Cup on next year: Ireland are just hitting their peak. Still, this was an ominous statement of intent by Andy Farrell’s side at a blustery and bellicose Aviva Stadium: standards set, gauntlets thrown down. Next week’s trip to Paris already feels like the potential crux of this tournament, which feels like a faintly ridiculous statement to make after just 80 minutes of play. But for Ireland and their long-agonising supporters, it may just be time to start believing the hype. It was a measure of Ireland’s dominance that a normally edgy Dublin crowd had begun to relax well before the end.  Ten minutes from time the Mexican waves were already swooping around the stadium, and a little air had drained from the place. At which point, as if to chide Ireland for their contentment, Taine Basham promptly pilfered a late consolation try following a rare moment of slackness from Tadhg Beirne. Still, the magnificent Beirne had more than earned his little late siesta, and in a way so had Ireland. Certainly you might argue that the scoreline flattered the losers, not the victors. Ireland could have put the game to bed within 20 minutes, but even without the points their supremacy deserved, the way they made Wales suffer during that opening quarter would tell later on. It was a great day for Bundee Aki and Garry Ringrose at centre, for Ronan Kelleher and Tadhg Furlong in the front row, for Andrew Conway and his two tries, for Jack Conan who won a crucial breakdown penalty late in the first half just as Wales were threatening to strike back. Indeed, pretty much the only Irishman who wasn’t enjoying himself was Rob Baloucoune: left out in favour of Mack Hansen, and now forced to watch the debutant rip up the defending Six Nations champions. Doubtless the talented Baloucoune will get a chance to add to his two Ireland caps before long. But here it was Hansen who seized his chance and seized the moment, earning the man-of-the-match award (probably out of sentiment as much as anything else) and almost certainly an extended run in the side. He made 94 metres, more than anyone on the pitch, two clean breaks and the sumptuous assist for Aki’s early try. But more important than the raw numbers was the spirit of enterprise, the sense of invention, an approach in ideal harmony with Farrell-ball and its preference for scruffy, virtuoso creativity. Farrell likes his wings to play “untidy”, to come in off the flank and start directing unstructured play in more central areas. Hansen fits this brief perfectly: according to Andy Friend, Hansen’s coach at Connacht, his preferred position is actually at 15 or 10. Now it was Hansen flinging the ball from midfield to Aki plunging over in the corner: a kind of Total Farrell. And yet, like all the best debuts, it owed itself to a tiny stroke of fortune. It came with barely a minute on the clock. Deep in his own territory, Jonny Sexton tried a little bunt-kick to try and get Ireland going. Only it bounced off Josh Adams, making his first start at centre for Wales. In that moment, perhaps, the entire fate of the game might have turned. The ricochet could have gone anywhere. It could have bounced up into Adams’s hands, from which he might have had an easy score and doubtless a much easier afternoon. Instead, it looped to Hansen, whose first act in senior international rugby was thus to sprint 60 yards up the wing and bring the crowd to their feet. Would Ireland still have won? Yes, probably. But it was instructive and perhaps a little poignant to see how wildly the fates of Hansen and Adams – the two big selection calls ahead of this game – would diverge from that moment on. Hansen set up the early score, was at the heart of Ireland’s attacking engine, helped to create Conway’s crucial third try by selling Dan Biggar an empty pair of arms and taking him out of the game. Meanwhile Adams would find himself badly exposed for Ireland’s second try, gave away a soft penalty in the build-up to the third and was then put in the sin bin for a brainless shoulder charge on Sexton. You can always tell a well-oiled team from how smoothly it accommodates newcomers, or players in new roles. In this respect Ireland look brilliantly drilled: aggressive in defence and maverick in attack, a team in which everyone knows their role and new players can hit the ground running, and yet which still has room for growth. For Wales, it is not yet the time for introspection and obsequies. Lose to Scotland next week, however, and the vultures may just start to circle.",Sport/Sport,Mack Hansen makes impact as Ireland aim for Total Farrell | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/05/mack-hansen-makes-instant-impact-as-ireland-aim-for-total-farrell
2/6/2022,"Johnny Sexton spoke of the relief his Ireland team feel at claiming maximum points from their first game of the Six Nations. Having lost the first two games of their campaign last year, Ireland opened with a resounding 29-7 win over the champions Wales in Dublin. “I would have snapped your hand off at the start of the game,” said the Ireland captain. “Big time, against the reigning champions, to come away with five points.  “When I looked out of the window this morning I knew it wasn’t going to be pretty. Thankfully, the rain stayed away for the most part, but the wind played its part in both halves really. “We knew if we could get a good foothold in the game in the first half playing into the elements, that second half we’d have the breeze behind us and we could use it to our advantage.” Last season, Ireland opened with defeat in Cardiff, a match that launched Wales’s successful championship. A week later, they lost at home to France, where they travel next. “I can’t tell you how demoralising the first game was last year,” said Sexton. “The Triple Crown was gone, the Grand Slam gone. You’re up against it to win the championship. That’s what we’re pleased about most. “We feel there’s plenty of stuff to brush up on next week. France away is arguably one of the biggest tests in world rugby. We need to be at our very best and we need to learn some lessons from today, even in victory. We did that over November, and hopefully we can continue in that vein.” After the low of that second defeat, Ireland ended up third in the table and embarked upon a winning run that now stands at nine and includes the scalps of England and New Zealand. “There’s always been confidence in the group, even when times were low in the first two games last year,” said Sexton. “We weren’t too far away and thankfully we’ve turned things around results-wise.” For Wales, there were few positives. Josh Adams was shown yellow a few minutes into the second half, but Wales were 17-0 down at that point – and another try down when he returned. Wayne Pivac was philosophical. “We made 100-odd tackles in the first half,” he said. “When you are defending for long periods like that, it makes it very difficult when we do get our hands on the ball. “It is certainly a game we will go away and improve on very quickly.. We always look at performance; you can look at the result. After that many tackles, a bit of fatigue does set in. It happens to any side. “The boys came back very strongly in that last quarter of the game and kept fighting towards the end, which is what we want.” Wales were not awarded a penalty until the 54th minute. “There was a lot of assistant referee interjection from one side of the field. He saw it a certain way and we might disagree with some of those calls, in particular the scrum. They see it the way they do and we have to go with those decisions at the time.”",Sport/Sport,"‘I knew it wasn’t going to be pretty,’ says jubilant Johnny Sexton after Ireland win",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/05/i-knew-it-wasnt-going-to-be-pretty-says-jubilant-johnny-sexton-after-ireland-win
2/6/2022,"Lord Michael Grade has admitted that he has “kept his hat in the ring” for the position of Ofcom chief executive, after having had “second thoughts” about applying. “I became suspicious of the process, until I realised Sue Gray was back in charge of the appointment after her ‘partygate’ exertions,” the former head of the BBC, 78, said, in an interview in the Telegraph.  “I was fully reassured and am now happy to keep my hat in the ring.” The process to fill the senior position at the media regulator has been marred by a series of delays since it began two years ago. After an initial round of interviews failed to produce a suitable candidate, renewed efforts to fill the position are now under way again. The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre withdrew his application despite reportedly being Boris Johnson’s preferred candidate, claiming the civil service had influenced the process to his disadvantage because of his right-of-centre “convictions”. Grade also criticised the BBC’s tone in its coverage of certain political events as “too aggressive” and “gleeful and disrespectful”. The Conservative peer, who was appointed by David Cameron in 2010 and has also held top jobs at Channel 4 and ITV, said the corporation was right to hold the government to account and that he was “not questioning [the BBC’s] news values” or objectivity, but stressed that he felt its “macho culture” was “unnecessary”. He told the Daily Telegraph: “They’re right to hold the prime minister to account. I have no problem with that. “But there seems to be a sense at the BBC that if you ask difficult questions politely, your colleagues are going to say: ‘You let him or her off the hook’. “It’s a macho culture. It’s unnecessary, and I don’t like it.”",News/Media,Michael Grade has ‘kept his hat in the ring’ for role of Ofcom chief executive,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/05/michael-grade-has-kept-his-hat-in-the-ring-for-role-of-ofcom-chief-executive
2/6/2022,"Two steps forward, one step back. That has been the pattern for Great Britain’s mixed doubles curlers so far at these Olympic Games. But despite a 7-5 loss to Italyon Saturday, Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds believe they can make a medal push – with the help of the “super powers” in Mouat’s Team GB cap. Mouat decided to start wearing the cap in matches after mixed performances in the opening three games, and he believes his form is now coming to the boil as a result. “It’s a wee bit of a superstition,” he said. “I didn’t play very well in the first three games and I was quite disappointed, so I put the hat on and it has got super powers, apparently.  “Potentially I play better with it on. Maybe it’s a vanity thing, my hair is all over the place. It just covers up a bad-hair day and people don’t worry about my hair, so I don’t worry about it.” Mouat said the idea of wearing a hat had first occurred to him in the Champions Cup final in the grand slam bubble last year. “The commentators were slagging me off for having quiffs and stuff in my hair,” he said. “The next day we were playing and I put a hat on, and someone made a Twitter account with it. I just kept it going and I think there are more Twitter followers on that than my own account now.” But while Mouat and Dodds are playing better, they know that one false step could end their dream of a mixed curling medal. After the Italy defeat they stand fourth, with four wins and two losses in their round-robin games. Two wins from their remaining three against China, Norway and the United States will surely be enough to make it to the semi-finals. “We’re pretty happy with how we’re doing,” he said. “It looks like a lot of teams are beating each other. The ideal situation is that we win all three of our remaining games and then we’re on seven, which would be nice. Six is the goal, though, and two wins out of the next three would be amazing.” Elsewhere, there were a series of disappointing British performances on the first day of the Games, including from Katie Ormerod in the snowboard slopestyle. Four years ago in Pyeongchang, Ormerod broke her heel in a fall that required seven operations. This time, in temperatures of -20C, she froze in the women’s slopestyle qualification, finishing 19th to miss out on the final. But the 24-year-old remained upbeat after two disappointing runs of 47.38 and 44.01, mainly because it meant so much to her to become an Olympian. “I stood at the top before my first run when I was about to drop in and I was like: ‘Wow, this is my moment, I’ve become an Olympian, finally’,” she said. “It was a really special moment and just to land that first run and get down, I’ve never felt a feeling like that. It was pure joy, and I’m so proud of myself for everything I’ve gone through, to finally get there again.” There was no joy either in the short track speed skating as Kathryn Thomson crashed within 15 seconds in the women’s 500m, Niall Treacy had a spill in the men’s 1000m, and his brother Farrell finished last after he thought he heard the bell and attempted a sprint finish a lap too early. Farrell revealed that he overcame “crazy anxiety” to reach the starting line in Beijing after testing positive for coronavirus in mid-January. “I got Covid before I came, and with the protocols in China, it was looking very unlikely that I was even going to be here,” said the 26-year-old, who made his Olympic Games debut in Pyeongchang in 2018. “Ten days of isolation is not fantastic when you’ve got the Games coming up, and I only came out here on Tuesday. Even before then I was having Covid tests every day to try to get negatives.” Rupert Staudinger sits 24th after the first two luge runs in the men’s singles, but he was able to make headlines for different reasons by wearing a special helmet in tribute to his former team-mate and three-times Olympian AJ Rosen, who died of cancer in December. “He played a huge part in my career and I decided that it’s a little thing to keep his memory alive,” said Staudinger, whose helmet said “rest in peace AJ”. “He was such a great guy. I’m a little bit speechless because it’s ever so sad that he’s not here any more. I had to get special permission to have the message on the helmet; it had to go through the IOC. But that wasn’t a problem.”",Sport/Sport,Mouat and Dodds hopeful of curling semi-final place despite loss to Italy,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/05/mouat-dodds-curling-gb-italy-winter-olympics
2/6/2022,"The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, reportedly blocked the appointment of a leading academic to run a £200m economic research body because he was allegedly considered too leftwing. Jonathan Michie, the president of Oxford University’s Kellogg College and a professor of innovation and knowledge exchange, was selected by an independent selection panel to be executive chair of the government-funded Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), reports the Financial Times.  But last month Michie, who was awarded an OBE for services to education this year, was reportedly vetoed by Kwarteng, who has restarted the selection process, infuriating academics who fear the body becoming politicised, according to the newspaper. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said none of the candidates were “deemed suitable”. A BEIS spokesperson said: “While the initial recruitment campaign returned a strong field of candidates, none were ultimately deemed suitable. Another campaign will start shortly with a view to attracting a wider range of candidates.” Boris Johnson’s government has been accused of stoking culture wars, attacking so-called “woke” culture and attempting to stifle debate at cultural institutions. A Kwarteng ally told the FT that the business secretary feared that Michie, who has connections to the circle of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, had previously been a member of the Communist party. Another reportedly said the business secretary was concerned about ESRC impartiality under Michie’s leadership and “what sort of research” it would finance. Michie did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. A person who knows him told the FT that Michie did not belong to any political party. Another reportedly said he did not hold extreme political views and has a history of being strictly non-political in academic roles over 30 years. In 1989 Michie wrote a book, Beyond the Casino Economy, with Seumas Milne, an old university friend and Corbyn’s former head of communications. The ESRC receives more than £200m a year of government funding for academic research in the social sciences. A spokesperson for the ESRC declined to comment, saying appointments are dealt with by BEIS. But they confirmed that the council has been led by an interim executive chair, Alison Park, since January last year.",News/Politics,Kwasi Kwarteng reportedly vetoed appointment of leftwing academic,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/05/kwasi-kwarteng-reportedly-vetoed-appointment-of-leftwing-academic
