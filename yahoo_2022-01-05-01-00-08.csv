1/5/2022,"Paris — Controversial French TV stars and famous twins Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff were inseparable in life, and in death. They had refused to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, believing their good health would save them, but were admitted to a hospital on the same day last month and diagnosed with COVID-19. The younger twin, Grichka, died in an intensive care unit on December 28. Igor followed him six days later on January 3. They were 72. The Bogdanoff twins were TV stars in France in the 1980s, famous as much for their offbeat popular science shows as for their good looks, multiplied by two. The pair were inseparable, and they were in and out of the spotlight for most of their adult lives. In 1979, they launched the first TV show entirely about science fiction, Temps X. Accused by academics of dumbing down science, it was that approach that made the show so popular with their audience. They were born on August 29, 1949 in southwest France. Descended from German and Austrian nobility, they were raised by their grandmother, a countess. The two studied applied mathematics before taking their science to television. They later went on to scrape just enough points to earn doctorates in physics, though there was huge controversy surrounding their theses on the Big Bang theory and on space-time links. There were also accusations of plagiarism. An internal university investigation concluded there was no scientific value to their work, but they were still awarded the doctorates. One scientist called the twins' writing, ""delightfully meaningless combinations of buzzwords,"" but worried that their evidence had nonetheless been taken seriously. Later the two prompted speculation that they had undergone cosmetic surgery, as their prominent cheekbones and facial features became even more pronounced. They denied ever having surgery. However, seeking as always to maintain an air of mystery, they said they had experimented with unnamed ""technologies"" to enhance their features. Neither brother was vaccinated against COVID-19. Asked about it on French radio last month, Igor Bogdanoff cited the controversial French scientist Dr. Didier Raoult – the man who made hydroxychloroquine a household name. Raoult said he had more confidence in future vaccines than those available now, and Igor Bogdanoff agreed that it was better to wait. Former French Education and Research minister Luc Ferry was a longtime friend of the brothers. He told French media he had spoken with the twins about the COVID vaccines and told them ""you're crazy"" not to get it. He said they were not anti-vaxxers, but did not want to have the vaccines themselves, believing that their good health and fitness would save them from the virus, but perhaps not any ill effects of the vaccines.

1/5/2022,"Melania Trump is auctioning off a collection of White House memorabilia. The ""Head of State"" collection includes a white hat, a watercolor painting, and an NFT. Bids starting at the equivalent of $250,000 in cryptocurrency will be accepted beginning on Jan. 11. Former first lady Melania Trump is auctioning off a collection of White House memorabilia including an Hervé Pierre hat, a watercolor painting, and a non-fungible token (NFT) commemorating French President Emmanuel Macron's 2018 state visit to the United States. Bids for the ""Head of State"" collection, which previews on Trump's website on Tuesday, will start at the equivalent of $250,000 in SOL cryptocurrency and will be accepted between January 11 and January 25, Trump announced on Tuesday. The centerpiece of the collection is an ""iconic wide-brimmed white hat"" that was custom designed and fashioned by Pierre. It features the same fabric as the Michael Kors suit worn by the former first lady during the 2018 state visit. ""It is important to note that Mr. Pierre designed Mrs. Trump's inaugural gown and served as her fashion stylist and consultant during the President,"" according to a statement announcing the auction. ""Indeed, Mrs. Trump's iconic white hat garnered media attention worldwide."" The collection also comes with an ""original watercolor"" painting created by fashion artist Marc-Antoine Coulon to commemorate and celebrate the occasion, and an accompanying NFT that will live on the Solana blockchain. All three items will be signed by Trump. Trump launched her first foray into the world of NFTs in mid-December with a digital artwork titled ""Melania's Vision"" representing her ""cobalt blue eyes,"" which was also designed by Coulon. Part of the proceeds from both Trump's initial NFT and the newly-announced ""Head of State"" collection will go to her ""Fostering the Future"" initiative, which helps children who have been in the foster care system access ""computer science and technology education,"" per the announcement.

1/5/2022,"Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in an interview Monday that it is likely that Republicans will win back the House in 2022, and said if they do, they will probably consider impeaching President Biden. Cruz appeared on ""Verdict with Ted Cruz,"" his podcast, and said Democrats ""weaponized impeachment"" during the Trump administration for partisan purposes, according to the Washington Times. ""One of the real disadvantages of doing that is the more you weaponized it and turn it into a partisan cudgel, you know what’s good for the goose is good for the gander,"" he said. He reposted an interview where he put the odds of Republicans taking back the House at 90-10 and 50-50 about taking back the evenly split Senate. Last September, four House Republicans filed impeachment articles against Biden over his handling of the southern border and the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. DALLAS MORNING NEWS RIPPED FOR ‘UTTERLY CLASSLESS STORY’ ON TED CRUZ’S TEENAGE DAUGHTER ""I filed articles of impeachment against @POTUS based on what I believe to be clear violations of his duties,"" Rep.
