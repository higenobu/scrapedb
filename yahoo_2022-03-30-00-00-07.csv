3/30/2022,"A Ukrainian mother has recounted being raped at gunpoint by Russian soldiers while her young son sobbed nearby. Speaking to The Times, the 33-year-old woman - whose identity has been hidden - described the shocking experience, which she says took place at the hands of two drunk soldiers who had shot her husband moments before. The case is believed to be the first official rape investigation into Russian solders carried out by Ukrainian authorities following the invasion. The woman says that, on 8 March, Russian troops entered her village, and her and her husband hung a white sheet from their gate to show ""there is just a family here and no one wants any harm”. Watch: Vehicles, apartments damaged as strikes hit residential zones in Kyiv The following day, she says, the soldiers returned and shot dead the family dog before going to look for petrol to use for a quad bike they had stolen from neighbours. After a confrontation with the commander of the soldiers, who is said to have ""leered"" at the woman, the troops left. However, two of the solders, including the commander, returned later that evening. Upon hearing noises at the front gate, the victim's husband - who has also not been named - went to investigate where he was summarily shot dead. The two soldiers are then accused of subjecting the mother to hours of abuse, raping her multiple times while her son cried nearby. “He said ‘you’d better shut up or I’ll get your child and show him his mother’s brains spread around the house’,"" she told The Times. “He told me to take my clothes off. Then they both raped me one after the other. They didn’t care that my son was in the boiler room crying. They told me to go shut him up and come back. ""All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying ‘how do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?’"" They left her for around 20 minutes, before returning and raping her once more. She said they were so drunk that they eventually fell asleep, at which point she grabbed her son and fled. The pair eventually escaped to the city of Ternopil where her husband’s sister had already been evacuated with her own children. Almost three weeks on, the child's son is still not aware that his father is dead.

Last week she was told he had been killed in fighting, but has not been able to confirm this information. The case has now become the first alleged rape by Russian soldiers to be officially investigated by Ukrainian authorities, Ukraine’s prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova announced last week. Maria Mezentseva, an MP for the city of Kharkiv, spoke of the case on Sunday, and insisted the country ""will not be silent"" about the crimes being committed against the women. She said: ""There is one case which was very widely discussed recently because it’s been recorded and proceeded with [by] the prosecutor’s office. ""We’re not going into details, but it’s quite a scary scene when a civilian was shot dead in his house in a small town next to Kyiv. ""His wife was – I’m sorry but I have to say it – raped several times in front of her underage child. ""There are many more victims rather than just this one case which has been made public by the prosecutor general. ""And of course, we are expecting many more of them, which will be public once victims will be ready to talk about that."" Ukrainian politicians have reported the systematic sexual abuse of women by Russian forces since the invasion began on 24 February. Rape was officially recognised as a war crime in 2008, with Dymtro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, vowing to prosecute troops who had committed such actions. Kuleba has previously welcomed a call to create a special tribunal to punish Putin, but added it was “difficult” to talk about international law amid the country’s current suffering.",News/Yahoo News UK,Ukraine: Mother 'raped by Russia troops in front of her son' recounts horrifying ordeal,https://news.yahoo.com/mother-raped-russia-troops-front-her-son-speaks-out-about-horrifying-ordeal-090644393.html
3/30/2022,"Max Mosley, the Formula One boss, shot himself dead after learning he had terminal cancer, an inquest has heard. The 81-year-old, son of the fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley and an ardent privacy campaigner, was found with a fatal gunshot wound to the head at his home in Chelsea, west London, last May. His family had announced his death in a statement at the time, but said only that he “died after a long battle with cancer”. On Tuesday, an inquest was told Mr Mosley took his own life after learning his lymphoma was incurable and he had just “weeks” to live. Mr Mosley’s housekeeper and personal assistant raised the alarm after growing worried about him and then finding a note on his bedroom door saying: “Do not enter, call the police.” Police officers entered the room, where the body of Mr Mosley was lying in bed with a double-barreled shotgun, Westminster Coroner’s Court was told. Nearby, a suicide note lay on his bedroom table which said: “I had no choice”. He tried to text Mr Mosley asking whether he wanted his breakfast upstairs, before eventually venturing up himself with the housekeeper, where he phoned 999 upon seeing the note. Mr Alexander said: ""He had an aggressive form of cancer and had been down. He said he had had enough.” The family doctor arrived at the scene shortly after the discovery of the body, a police officer told the inquest. Det Con Ben Benlounes said: ""(The doctor) did say the consultation was he may have two to three weeks left and this could have been the reason why he killed himself."" The officer confirmed Mr Mosley had a gun licence and kept four firearms on the property, but there was found to be nothing suspicious about his death. Dr Christopher McNamara, a consultant haematologist who first saw Mr Mosley in October 2019, said he had diagnosed a high-grade lymphoma and recommended a course of chemotherapy for prostate cancer. The treatment did not stop the cancer, however, leading Mr Mosley to undertake further treatment, including some against his doctor’s advice such as proton beam therapy, the court heard. Dr McNamara said he eventually referred Mr Mosley to palliative care colleagues and he initially “accepted” he had a terminal illness. A fistula soon developed which left him with an “uncomfortable” quality of life, the doctor said. He told the inquest: ""Mr Mosley had expressed ideas of committing suicide to myself and other colleagues and had been referred to appropriate colleagues. ""He never expressed a plan of doing this and always said the problem was that his wife would not accept this.” Dr Rasha Al-Qurainy, who led his palliative care, said that Mr Mosley never gave any indication of suicide ideation.

3/30/2022,"Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens have previously criticized US support for Ukraine. Wladimir Klitschko told Newsmax that anyone who opposed helping Ukraine is ""part of this invasion."" Klitschko, a champion boxer whose brother is Kyiv's mayor, recently joined the Ukrainian military. Wladimir Klitschko told Newsmax on Monday that Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens, who have vocally opposed helping Ukraine, are ""part of"" Russia's invasion of Ukraine, citing their opposition to US support for the country. Wladimir Klitschko, the former boxing champion whose brother Vitali is mayor of Kyiv, made the comments during an appearance on ""Eric Bolling The Balance"" on Monday. He was responding to a question by Bolling about what he would say to the ""small group"" of American who believe the conflict in Ukraine is ""not America's problem."" He named Owens and Carlson as examples. ""If you passively observe what is going on, and we do share the same principles of freedom and democratic principles, like the United States, like the Western world, so to speak. If you are passively observing, you are part of this invasion, blood is on your hands, too,"" Klitschko said. ""If you still have business and trade with Russia and you don't isolate Russia economically, you're bringing bullets and rockets into the Russian army's hands..."" he said. ""Those disturbing images of my country ... you should feel a connection with that."" Klitschko, a former heavyweight boxing champion, joined the Ukrainian Territorial Defence Forces in Kyiv a few weeks before Russia's invasion of the country. Vitali Klitschko, also a former boxing champion, has been mayor of Kyiv since 2014. Carlson has repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin in the lead-up to the invasion and also questioned why America should assist Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Even though he has changed his view of Putin since the invasion, Carlson was still critical of the support for Ukraine by Americans earlier this month, calling it ""the largest political flash mob in American history,"" The Independent reported. Owens also received backlash for her claim that Ukraine ""wasn't a thing until 1989"" and that it was ""stupid"" to suggest Putin was carrying out a ""genocide"" in the country, according to The Independent. Her words were endorsed by the Russian embassy in Washington D.C. after tweeting the phrase ""Russian lives matter,"" Salon reported. Owens and Carlson did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
