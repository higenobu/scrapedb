4/25/2022,"Assured of another five years in the Élysée after beating his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen, on Sunday, Emmanuel Macron faces a second term at least as challenging as his first, if not more so. Here we look at some of the key challenges and priorities of the re-elected president: Parliamentary elections in France take place on 12 and 19 June, with Macron’s La République en Marche (LaREM) and its allies needing a majority of 289 MPs in the 577-seat lower house. The first round of the presidential poll produced the near-collapse of France’s parties of government, with the rightwing Les Républicains and the Socialists each scoring less than 5%, and the emergence of three equal blocs: the radical left, Macron’s diverse centre, and the far right. Without a majority, a French president’s room for manoeuvre is significantly reduced, and even if the first-round voting pattern does not repeat itself in the parliamentary poll, Macron will need outside support. Some will doubtless come from the moderate wing of Les Républicains. Macron has said his government will be open to “anyone who supports his project”, but negotiations will be tough. He has also said the environment will be central to his second term and his new prime minister will be tasked with with “ecological planning”. Data suggests only the poorest 5% are worse off than they were five years ago, but following a sustained squeeze large numbers of voters said they had trouble making ends meet and the cost of living became the key issue of the campaign. Macron has said he will maintain price caps on gas and electricity and a government rebate on fuel prices at the pumps if energy costs continue to rise. He has also outlined further measures including greater support for the low-paid and self-employed. Macron has promised the unpopular pension reforms he failed to implement in his first mandate – aising the retirement age progressively to 65 by 2031 except for those in hard physical jobs – will be in place by autumn. He aims to launch an initial consultation with unions and employers before the summer and has promised not to push through the plans by presidential decree, but will not drop them, saying they are economically essential and were in his manifesto. Street protests are highly likely. He is due to launch early consultations on reforms to France’s centralised education system, introducing further autonomy for schools and universities, and healthcare regime, aiming in particular to improve provision in rural areas. He has also pledged to recruit more police, magistrates and judicial support workers. France’s six-month presidency of the EU – with its priorities of securing the bloc’s external borders and controlling clandestine migration, deepening defence cooperation and developing a European economic “growth model” based on hi-tech investment – still has more than two months to run. Russia’s war on Ukraine is still raging and a crucial Nato summit is scheduled for June. Macron, the EU’s most visible leader, has since his 2017 election demonstrated his wish to be an outspoken defender of western values with a clear desire to shape world events; that will not change. A major underlying challenge for Macron reflects the fact that while both contenders had their supporters, a significant percentage of ballots cast in France’s 2022 presidential election were votes of rejection. The number of spoiled votes, and the abstention rate, were also alarmingly high. He may have been reelected, but about two-thirds of the electorate do not much like Macron. If an even more traumatic race is to be avoided in 2027, the president has acknowledged he must prioritise rebuilding ties with those who stayed away, or lent him their vote solely to block Le Pen. He has promised to listen and consult more. He will have to.",News/World news,What’s in Emmanuel Macron’s intray after his re-election as French president?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/whats-in-emmanuel-macrons-intray-after-his-re-election-as-french-president
4/25/2022,"The progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told Amazon’s first unionized workers in New York on Sunday that their victory was “the first domino to fall” in what she expected to be a wave of similar votes for representation across the country. The leftwing Democrat joined Vermont senator Bernie Sanders on stage in Staten Island to celebrate the historic achievement and to call for workers in more Amazon facilities in the US to follow their example. “What happened out here … what you guys did in Staten Island was just the beginning. It was the first domino to fall,” she said, noting that workers at a second Amazon sorting facility in the New York borough were voting on Monday. “We have another election tomorrow, and we’re going to support them in that. And the day after that, and the day after that, all the way. But what we need Amazon to do first and foremost is to recognize the union that won their election.” Amazon has so far refused to acknowledge the vote at its Staten Island fulfillment center, after it was accused of intimidating and hounding workers during the campaign with anti-union messages, and spending millions of dollars to try to ensure the vote failed. Immediately after the result, Amazon, owned by the world’s second richest man Jeff Bezos, whose personal wealth is estimated by Forbes at $170bn, went to court to try to get the outcome overturned. “First and foremost, Amazon, Jeff Bezos, everybody, we got to recognize the fact that they did this thing, and they won a union election fair and square,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “You got to treat our people right. You can give our workers a bathroom break, you can ensure you’re treating people well and giving them solid health care benefits, and that they don’t have a three-hour commute to and from work, that they can afford a house they can live in, that people are not going to be sleeping in their cars in order to work for Amazon. “All of this is an indignity and an injustice and it has no place in New York city and we’re going to change that, and right here our workers out here are going to change that.” Sanders was equally scathing of Amazon’s treatment of workers. “When you got a corporation that is making huge profits, you know what, you can pay your workers good wages, provide good benefits, and you can have decent working conditions, not what you got right now,” he said. Addressing Chris Smalls, the union organizer behind the successful New York vote, and fellow activists in attendance, Sanders added: “You may not know this, but you have been an inspiration for millions of workers all across this country, who have looked at you and said, ‘these guys in Staten Island stood up to an extraordinarily powerful corporation. If they can do it in Staten Island, we can do it throughout this country’.” Sanders also took a shot at centrist Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, whom he said were “sabotaging” America’s working class with their opposition to Joe Biden’s social reform agenda. Although he did not mention them by name, it was clear he was attacking the two Democrats whose opposition to Biden’s Build Back Better package of social spending, welfare assistance and climate measures blocked its passage through Congress. “To get it passed we need at least 50 Democrats who are going to stand up with the working class of this country, we don’t have it,” he said. “We have a couple of people who are busy sabotaging the working-class agenda.”",News/US news,Ocasio-Cortez to unionized Amazon workers: victory is ‘just the beginning’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/24/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democrats-bernie-sanders-amazon
4/25/2022,"As Ukraine celebrated the high point of the Orthodox year, the capital’s Pechersk Lavra – a monastery complex that has allegiance to the Moscow Patriarch – held an Easter service under unusually strained circumstances. Normally, streets across Ukraine on the night before Easter Sunday would be dotted with Orthodox believers walking to church. Easter services in the Orthodox world start the night before and end at dawn on Sunday – to symbolise Jesus rising from the dead. But in wartime Ukraine, every city is subject to strict curfews that usually start in the mid-evening and last until early morning. To allow for Easter celebrations, a few Kyiv churches, including the Unesco-protected Pechersk Lavra, were granted permission to hold lock-ins. Instead of coming and going as they pleased, believers had to stay inside the historic walled complex from 11pm on Saturday until 5am on Sunday. For more than 400 years, the only Orthodox church in Ukraine recognised by Constantinople was the Ukrainian Orthodox church, aligned with the Moscow Patriarch. But in 2018, after decades of campaigning, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, which is viewed as the leading authority for the world’s 300 million Orthodox worshippers, granted Ukraine the right to an independent church. Hundreds of Ukrainian parishes voted to switch, though thousands more remained with the Moscow Patriarch. Key historic sites around Ukraine, the birthplace of eastern European Orthodoxy, are now controlled by priests of different affiliations. The Pechersk Lavra is one that remained with the Moscow Patriarch (the 1,000-year-old St Sophia’s Cathedral is controlled by the Kyiv Patriarch), and until recently Ukrainian intelligence services deemed its religious leaders to be agents of the Kremlin for their Moscow links. The clerics now say they are independent of Moscow and have come out against “Russia’s war against Ukraine”, earning the support of advisers to Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. On invitation from one of Pechersk Lavra’s senior priests, the Guardian was let into the hand-painted interior of the 18th-century Trapezniy church – one of the 12 churches of the monastery, which sits on Kyiv’s riverbanks – for its night-time service. In the main part of the church, believers were saving their places for a long night around the altar. On the other end of the church, a line of believers had formed for confession, which in Orthodoxy is achieved by kissing an icon with a priest standing over the believer, covering the believer’s head with his stole. The service was broadcast live for those who could not attend. But less than an hour later, the priests at the altar stopped chanting to issue an unscheduled notice: “It is forbidden to photograph, would the person photographing please stop now.” The cleric Metropolitan Pavel, who was leading the Easter service and whom the Ukrainian authorities have investigated under charges of whipping up religious hatred, said we had to leave. “You have to understand the [Ukrainian] ministry of culture won’t like there being lots of people here,” said an assistant cleric. “We don’t want them to close down the Lavra.” The official live broadcast was allowed because the church video cameras were placed in such a way as to obscure the number of believers, the assistant explained. “We don’t want anyone to know [how many came],” he said. Showing the live broadcast of a lock-in service being held by the “others” at the independent Ukrainian Mykhailivsky Cathedral in Kyiv, he pointed out that there were fewer people in attendance. “No one wants to be photographed,” said a second assistant, who lamented the fact that before the war, hundreds of journalists would attend the Easter service. The first assistant said the ministry of culture had restricted the number of believers who could attend the lock-in and that even by holding the services, they were breaking the law – though, a priest at Mykhailivsky Cathedral whom the Guardian spoke with said there were no such restrictions. “We live in a rightwing state,” said the first assistant. “The president supports us but there are people who want to take the Lavra away from us – physically take it away.” Asked who he meant, he named the far-right Ukrainian battalion Right Sector, which formed to fight Russian-backed separatists in 2014. Since then, Kremlin propaganda has exaggerated the power and popularity of the group in Ukraine and repeatedly accused Ukrainians who have come out against Moscow of being Right Sector members. “This war is a mistake,” said the assistant. Vladimir Putin has used Moscow’s historical dominance over churches in Ukraine as a key argument for Russia’s right to control the country and was angered when Kyiv was granted independence. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Moscow Patriarch, Kirill, has portrayed it as a holy war and has been a vocal supporter of Russian soldiers’ work in Ukraine. But during an Easter Saturday service, Patriarch Kirill was notably more restrained. He appeared to have ditched his pro-violence stance and called for an end to the conflict – though he did not criticise it. The Metropolitans’ assistants said it was not their place to comment on Patriarch Kirill’s position. “We have helped lots of refugees – housed them in our dormitory in the Lavra. Ten of our priests are travelling right now to Mariupol to oversee funerals,” one said. “Metropolitan Onufriy [the head representative in Kyiv of the Moscow Patriarch Church in Ukraine] has called it Russian aggression but some people in the authorities have put us in a box.”",News/World news,‘We don’t want people to know’: Moscow-aligned Easter service in Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/we-dont-want-people-to-know-moscow-aligned-easter-service-in-kyiv
4/25/2022,"It was third time unlucky for Marine Le Pen, who failed to convince French voters to elect her president on Sunday. She detoxified her far-right National Rally party and threw out the Holocaust denying, xenophobic thugs – including her own father – softened her image with stories of how much she adores her cats and appeared on television with reassuring smiles and a wardrobe of soothingly neutral coloured clothes. She even dropped Frexit – though many argued that her intention to create an “alliance” of European nations within the European Union was effectively leaving the EU by stealth – dropped support for the death penalty and apparently abandoned the idea of banning the right to dual nationality while remaining firmly anti-immigration. But despite repeatedly trumpeting her rival Emmanuel Macron’s alleged “arrogance” and “disdain for the French people”, her programme still did not appeal to enough voters to give her the keys to the Élysée Palace. On Sunday night, Le Pen conceded defeat while claiming her projected 42% share of the vote represented “a victory in itself” and said she would continue the political fight against Macron . “Millions of our compatriots have chose us and change. We are more determined than ever and our determination to defend the French people is greater than ever. This defeat is in itself a form of hope,” she told supporters. Warning that the next five years would be “as brutal as the last five years” she pledged: “I will continue my commitment to France and the French. It’s not over. In a few weeks we have the legislative elections.” Her speech, which did not include the traditional congratulations to the winner, ended with a rendition of La Marseillaise. Le Pen’s promise to continue the fight and “never abandon France” throws in doubt her pledge to relinquish her presidential ambitions. She had said she would not stand again but her speech left the door open to another bid to lead France. At 53 years old, she is still a youngster in French political terms, though Macron, 44, and his team have lowered the age average by some decades. However, she has also indicated she will not give up politics altogether to spend more time with her cats. “I have become a cat breeder. It’s a passion. One can do politics while having a profession, or turn a passion into a profession,” she told RTL radio last year. Last month, she told France’s Sunday newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche: “A priori I will not stand [for president] again. But I will continue to do what I have done for years, I will defend the French. I don’t know in what role, but it will be in one where I am most effective.” Le Pen took over her father Jean-Marie Le Pen’s Front National party in 2011 and set about cleaning up its image. Le Pen père had caused a political earthquake in France in 2002 when he unexpectedly won a place in the second round of the presidential with only 17.8% of the vote. Marine Le Pen scored 17.9% in the first round of the 2012 presidential election in which the socialist Ségolène Royal faced Nicolas Sarkozy in the second round. Sarkozy won. In 2017, Le Pen scored 21.3% in the first round and faced Macron in the second. Macron won and Le Pen changed the party name to the Rassemblement National (RN). This time, Le Pen increased her first round score to 23.25%. However, the far-right vote was split between her and Éric Zemmour, who scored 5.1%, suggesting her score could have been much higher. Antoine Bristielle, director of the Observatory of Opinion at the left-leaning Jean-Jaurès Foundation, said Le Pen could face an internal party struggle if she steped back from frontline politics. Le Pen handed over the reins of her party to the up-and-coming far-right star Jordan Bardella, a 26-year-old son of Italian immigrants who grew up in a gritty Paris banlieue. There are several other youngsters waiting in the wings, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who dumped family loyalty to support Zemmour in the first round. “A danger for the radical right family is that there will be an internal war to take over as leader,” Bristielle said. “Even if Marine Le Pen is not great at campaigning, she is very good at organising the party. Her strength has been to maintain a united front within it. The risk is that this will fracture without her.”",News/World news,What’s next for Marine Le Pen?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/whats-next-for-marine-le-pen-france-election
4/25/2022,"The pro-European centrist Emmanuel Macron has won a second term as French president, becoming the first leader to win re-election in France for 20 years, after a bruising campaign in which he beat the far right’s Marine Le Pen by a decisive 58.2% to 41.8%, according to initial projected results. Macron, who is to address supporters in a victory rally at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, beat Le Pen with a lower margin than the 66% he won against her in 2017. Turnout was also lower than five years ago, with abstention estimated at 28%. Le Pen succeeded in delivering the far right its biggest-ever score in a French presidential election, after campaigning on the cost of living crisis, and promising a ban on the Muslim headscarf in public places as well as nationalist measures to give priority to native-French people over others for jobs, housing, benefits and healthcare. She called it “a shining victory in itself”, adding: “The ideas we represent are reaching summits.” During a frantic final two weeks’ campaigning, Macron had travelled to town squares across France to shake off what he felt was the unjustly persistent tag of a being an aloof “president of the rich”. He had promised to dedicate the next five years to restoring France to full employment, arguing that his policies such as loosening French labour laws had already succeeded in creating jobs and that he would definitively put an end to the country’s decades of mass unemployment. But although Macron has promised his own swift new package of laws to address the cost of living crisis and tempered his time frame for raising the retirement age, he ultimately focused far less on his own manifesto in the final days and more on stopping what he called the “unthinkable”: the far-right, anti-immigration Le Pen taking the helm in France, the eurozone’s second biggest economy and a nuclear power. Macron had described the final days of his re-election campaign as a “battle for Europe” against the Eurosceptic Le Pen. He will use his win to bolster his push for an increased EU defence project, closer collaboration on immigration and more regulation to counter the weight of giant tech platforms such as Google. France holds the rotating European Council presidency until the end of June. Macron had framed the choice between himself and Le Pen as “a referendum on Europe, ecology and secularism” and said the far-right leader’s demands for EU treaty change would have seen France pushed out of the bloc. He called her a “climate sceptic” and said her plan to ban the Muslim headscarf from all public places, including the street, would breach the French constitution and religious liberties, and spark “a civil war”.  Macron accused Le Pen of being financially “dependent” on Vladimir Putin’s Russia, after she took out a Russian loan for her party in 2014, and said her ties to the Kremlin meant she would have been a dangerous choice at the time of war in Ukraine. Le Pen, in turn, had said that “fear was the only argument he had left”. But Macron knew that, after campaigning to stop Le Pen, his support at the ballot box would reflect as much the rejection of the far right as support for his own programme. “If the French put their trust in me on April 24, I know full well … that there will be a part of the people who voted for me who would have done it to block the Front National,” he had told the TV programme Quotidien, deliberately using the former name for Le Pen’s party, now renamed the National Rally. “And so it won’t mean they have given me a blank cheque and that they support and find brilliant every point of my programme.” A significant number of the 7.7 million first-round voters for the radical left’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who narrowly missed reaching the final, had said they felt torn over abstaining or voting to keep out Le Pen. Macron had leaned to the left in the final days to try to court Mélenchon voters, promising to speed up measures against climate breakdown and expand environmental policy. His first task is to appoint a new prime minister, who he promised would be specifically devoted to addressing the climate crisis. The focus will now shift to the parliamentary elections in June, where Macron will seek to get a majority for his centrist grouping, possibly expanding alliances with the right. He had promised a “big new political movement” and could go as far as rebranding his party, La République En Marche. Both Le Pen and Mélenchon are seeking to increase their parties’ lawmakers. For his first step, Macron has promised to introduce a package of measures to ease the pressure of the cost of living crisis before summer, including continuing caps on gas and energy prices.",News/World news,"Emmanuel Macron wins French presidential election, projected results show",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/emmanuel-macron-wins-french-presidential-election-say-projected-results
4/25/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has admitted that the sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich made keeping Antonio Rüdiger at Chelsea virtually impossible. The Germany international, whose contract expires in the summer, was offered a new deal worth £200,000 a week before the sanctions started. When the defender requested a large signing-on fee and a payment to his representatives, Chelsea’s hands were tied. Speaking after his side’s 1-0 victory over West Ham on Sunday, Tuchel confirmed that the player would be departing and said: “We fought hard; I fought hard on a personal level. We made big offers to him, and the club tried everything. But for some weeks we cannot fight any more because we have the sanctions. We cannot adjust. We cannot continue, and so it is what it is.” Tuchel then praised the player who joined from Roma for an initial £29m in 2017: “He deserves my full support because he delivered incredible performances right until today. I’m just happy that I had the chance to coach him and to have him in the team. Because he was nothing but brilliant.” With Andreas Christensen also out of contract and set to join Barcelona, Tuchel was asked whether he hoped the sanctions would soon be lifted: “It would be ideal but even if we wish for it, you cannot pull grass so that it grows faster. We have to deal with the reality and at the moment the sanctions are still in place. The situation is not clear for next season, so we try to focus on what we can influence. This will be the next match.” West Ham have suffered a contract setback of their own, with Declan Rice rejecting an extension that would have made them the best-paid player in the club’s history. David Moyes drew a distinction between Rice’s and Rüdiger’s situations, with the former’s deal running until 2024 and the club holding the option to extend for a further 12 months. “The difference is he [Rüdiger] is out of contract,” Moyes said. “I think we’ve said what we think. We like Dec, he’s got three and a half years to go. I don’t think there’s any big panic.” Rice kissed the West Ham badge after the recent Europa League quarter-final victory over Lyon, and Moyes was asked whether the latest move may confuse fans. “Maybe he just wants more money,” the manager said. “People do turn down contacts. It’s not unusual that players at clubs turn down contracts. Maybe it’s a negotiation tactic.”",Sport/Football,Tuchel admits sanctions ended Chelsea’s hope of keeping Rüdiger,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/24/tuchel-admits-sanctions-ended-chelseas-hope-of-keeping-rudiger
