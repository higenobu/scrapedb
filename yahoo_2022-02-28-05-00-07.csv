 A veteran interpreter broke into tears on Sunday while translating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's speech for a German news outlet. An emotional video shared on social media showed the translator, who has not yet been identified, starting to choke up while interpreting Zelensky's speech for the German news service Welt. She translated part of his speech and was heard saying, ""Russia is on the path of evil, Russia must lose its voice in the U.N."" She then starts to struggle as she continues the translation. ""Ukraine, we definitely know.."" she says, before pausing briefly, ""what we are defending."" As she speaks, her voice begins to break and she tries to calm down. Then, after a breath, she quietly says ""sorry"" and goes off the air. Zelensky spoke to the Ukrainian people on Sunday after several cities in the country were attacked by Russian forces. ""The night was hard,"" he said. ""The people rose to defend their state and they showed their true faces. This is terror. ""They are going to bomb our Ukrainian cities even more,"" the Ukrainian president added. ""They are going to kill our children even more insidiously. This is an evil that has come to our land and must be destroyed.""",World/The Hill,Veteran interpreter breaks down in tears after Zelensky remarks,https://news.yahoo.com/veteran-interpreter-breaks-down-tears-182409302.html
2/28/2022,"BERLIN/BEIJING (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stressed China's ""special responsibility"" with regard to Ukraine in a telephone call with Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, the ministry said on Twitter on Saturday. China had abstained on Friday from vetoing a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would have deplored Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, a move Western countries viewed as a win for showing Russia's international isolation. Wang said China supported NATO, the European Union and Russia in resuming dialogue on building a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism, China's foreign ministry said. ""China does not support the use of sanctions to solve problems and is opposed to unilateral sanctions that have no basis in international law,"" it quoted Wang as saying on the call, in a statement issued on Sunday. ""We believe that the Council should contribute to a political solution to the current crisis, rather than instigate new confrontations,"" Wang said on the call. China had been preventing the use of expressions authorising use of force and sanctions, he added.
