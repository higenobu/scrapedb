3/23/2022,"There is a photo of Ash Barty that never seems to get old. A six-year-old on a rain-soaked tennis court. Racket in one hand, junior trophy in the other. Familiar dimpled grin under a well-worn Nike cap. It is miniature Barty, a small kid with big stars in her eyes. That picture was taken in 2002 – 20 years before she would leave that tennis court for good, with all of those big things achieved. And perhaps there should have been even more. After Barty won the Australian Open in January, all the questions were around not whether she would win another grand slam, but how many she would win. That the answer is now and will forever be zero feels incomprehensible. She is a player at her peak – literally at the top of the rankings. She has stood there for the best part of three years and remains unchallenged. But then there is that other part of Barty. The person, not the player. Who has always acted on her own terms and refuses to be defined by the sport she happens to be absurdly good at. Who retired once before when it didn’t feel right and returned when it did. In this sense, her latest bombshell is peculiarly refreshing. Barty is ambitious, but that ambition has always been tempered with perspective. She knew what she wanted and was content once it was achieved. As she said on Wednesday, that thing was Wimbledon. It was “the one true dream that I wanted in tennis”. Last year, after she did it, something inside her shifted. The Australian Open was unfinished business, so she made that happen too. Then she was spent, physically and mentally, and ready to retire on a high. Athletes across all sports speak about going out on top. Often it entails a requisite number of trophies, awards or other tangible measures of accomplishment. Barty has that, too – more than most players could ever imagine. Yet she is not a record-chaser. Everything she has said and done suggests that there will never be regrets or what-ifs. That she is not interested in the history books. She will be a part of them anyway. Because in making this stunning, staggering decision, Barty has reframed the definition of success. She has told all the statisticians that it can be calculated in quality instead of quantity, and that the quality does not always have to be experienced in the form of titles. That moments can make careers. Sometimes, of course, the moments and the titles collide. When she won Wimbledon, it was 50 years after Evonne Goolagong Cawley did so, while wearing a replica of her mentor’s outfit from half a century ago. After she reigned at Melbourne Park, she took her trophy to Uluru and played tennis on the red dirt with Indigenous kids who are just like she was in that childhood photo. She has told us on many occasions that she knows and cherishes her roots. In 2014, when tennis yanked her away from those roots before she was ready, she retired at 18. She went home to Australia, and played cricket in the Women’s Big Bash League and a heap of golf, a detour that ultimately restored the hunger she had lost. The second coming was guided by a careful blueprint to ensure such burnout did not occur again. Her partner and family travelled everywhere she went, part of her ubiquitous “team”. She picked her tournaments, and in between retreated to Queensland to recalibrate. The result on the court was an inexorable rise from outside the top 200 to world No 1 and a French Open title. It showed itself in a bewitching all-court game and a composure rarely matched by her peers. And in an era blighted by on-court misbehaviour and off-court controversy, Barty also gave tennis the wholesome, humble character it so urgently needed. Humility trumped hype, and modesty made her a mate of most on the tour. She felt like a friend to the fans, too. They had travelled with her through her psychological struggles to find her place within the bizarre machinations of a sport driven my big money and big personalities. Even those indifferent to sport had a reason to watch. “Barty Party” became a cliche, but it also required no explanation because they were at the soiree too, with the most personable sports star who relished winning in the right way. That is partly the enigma of Barty, who is endearingly predictable in so much of what she says and does but also keeps her cards close to her chest. Not a soul outside her inner circle saw this coming. On Wednesday she told her good friend and former doubles partner Casey Dellacqua this was the first time she had said the word “retiring” out loud. “And it’s hard to say,” she said. “But I’m so happy, and I’m so ready, and I just know at the moment in my heart for me as a person this is right … I’ll never stop loving tennis. It’ll always be a massive part of my life. But now I think it’s important that I get to enjoy the next phase of my life as Ash Barty the person, not as Ash Barty the athlete.” Even since those early days, when miniature Barty banged balls against her family’s garage wall in Ipswich and stood grinning with her trophy, she has somehow managed to be both.",Sport/Sport,"Ash Barty redefined what sporting success looks like – as quality, not quantity",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/commentisfree/2022/mar/23/ash-barty-redefined-what-sporting-success-looks-like-as-quality-not-quantity
3/23/2022,"Rishi Sunak will give his spring statement on Wednesday on the second anniversary of the initial Covid lockdown, with the economy still reeling from the effects of the pandemic and facing fresh headwinds from war in Ukraine. In the two years since the government first ordered people to stay indoors to guard against soaring infections, the country has been through huge economic changes. Initial turmoil and uncertainty eventually gave way to a gradual recovery, but now UK households face a worsening cost of living crisis amid high inflation and a surge in energy prices made worse by Vladimir Putin’s invasion. Britain’s economy suffered the worst recession in 100 years as the initial wave of Covid-19 and late entry into a tight lockdown caused a sudden stop in activity across the country. UK GDP plunged by almost 20% in the second quarter of 2020, and by 9.4% for the year as a whole – the worst performance in the G7. The economy has since grown at the fastest rate in the group of wealthy nations, partly because of the snapback from a bigger fall, and returned to pre-Covid levels in December. However, other G7 nations are further above their pre-pandemic levels, including the US and France. Inflation has risen to the highest rate since 1992 in the fallout from Covid-19, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatening to add to the problem. Disruption to global supply chains, shortages of workers and materials, and a boom in demand after lockdown have led to the cost of living soaring around the world. In the UK, trade disruption has been added to by Brexit. Inflation had sunk close to zero early in the pandemic as businesses struggled with evaporating demand. However, stimulus from central banks and governments helped soften the blow and maintain spending power. With war in Ukraine now fuelling a sharp rise in global energy prices, the Bank of England expects inflation could reach 8% this spring. It has forecast that the rate could peak close to 10% this year. The UK government budget deficit – the gap between spending and income – surged to a peacetime record of about £318bn in 2020-21, as tax receipts collapsed and the state pumped billions of pounds into emergency pandemic support such as furlough, business grants and loans. The national debt – the sum of every budget deficit – has risen to about £2.3tn, or about 95% of GDP, the highest level since the early 1960s. Borrowing has fallen sharply in 2021-22 as the economy recovers, to about £150bn, although is expected to remain higher than pre-Covid levels in each year until at least the middle of the decade. Public transport use has been slow to recover from the pandemic amid a rise in working from home. The number of car journeys is close to pre-Covid levels, although the number of trips on buses remains at 80% and usage is lower in London. A minority of Britons worked from home during the pandemic, with rates reaching a peak of about 48% in February 2021 – with more people in the capital working from home because of a higher proportion of office-based jobs than in smaller cities and towns. Figures show the London underground is quieter on Mondays than later in the week, as office staff embrace flexible working in a trend that could persist after the pandemic. Lockdown fuelled a boom in internet shopping as consumers stayed away from the high street. While online sales have fallen back as physical shops reopened, experts expect a permanent shift to higher rates of internet sales after the pandemic. Online spending rose from about 19% of total retail sales in February 2020 to a peak of 37.8% during the January 2021 lockdown, before cooling back to about 27% in January 2022. The shift has prompted a wave of shop closures, changing the landscape of Britain’s high streets. Online firms have recorded bumper profits – enriching their billionaire owners – while fuelling rapid growth in warehouse and delivery jobs. House prices have soared during the coronavirus pandemic, in an unusual trend during a recession. The average UK house price was £275,000 in December 2021, a rise of £27,000 from a year earlier. The government’s stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland, launched by Sunak in the summer of 2020 amid concerns of a housing market crash, spurred demand. Helped by savings built up during lockdown for wealthier households able to get on the property ladder, and employment levels remaining robust, homeowners looking to move for more space during lockdown also fuelled the market outside urban centres.",News/Business,How has the UK economy fared in the two tumultuous years since Covid?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/23/how-has-the-uk-economy-fared-in-the-two-tumultuous-years-since-covid
3/23/2022,"Wednesday 23 March marks two years since the first lockdown. The Guardian has collated 24 tributes for people who have died from coronavirus – one for every month since the first lockdown began. March 2020 Covid took the life of Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab at the age of 13, a little more than a week after England locked down for the first time. It also took his family’s chance to lay him to rest. Two siblings of Ismail, believed at the time to be the first child in the UK to die with the virus, began displaying symptoms shortly before his funeral, meaning his relatives had to self-isolate. They described him as a “gentle and kind” boy with a “heart-warming” smile, the BBC reported. His sister later told reporters: “I think, with everything happening so fast, it is hard to accept reality, especially when you don’t see them during their last moments.” His case was among those to prompt government ministers to rethink the rules around funerals, with the then health secretary Matt Hancock saying the sight of his coffin “being lowered into a grave without a member of his family present was too awful”. April 2020 Belly Mujinga’s family are still waiting for answers nearly two years after she died. The rail worker was on duty at London’s Victoria station in late March 2020, when it was alleged a person claiming to have the virus coughed and spat at her and a colleague. Mujinga, mother to Ingrid and wife of Lusamba Gode Katalay, died two weeks later. She was remembered as a generous woman who would leave no one behind; her family recounting several stories of her bringing people lost and alone on London’s vast transport network home with her, feeding them and paying for them to get where they needed to go. Yet they felt she was abandoned when she needed help. She was a woman with underlying health conditions sent to work in direct contact with the public during a pandemic, a woman who died alone and whose funeral was limited to only 10 people. An independent scientific expert is to examine her case but the inquest it is hoped will finally provide some clarity is not expected to start until this summer. May 2020 Thought to be the youngest victim of the pandemic, Coolio Morgan lived only three days. His father Carl Morgan told reporters that said medics kept Coolio alive just long enough for him and the child’s mother, Kimberly Phillips, to see him. “The only time I saw him was on the last day of his life,” his father told an inquest into the child’s death. Speaking after the hearing at Pontypridd coroner’s court, he said: “They told me he’d tested positive for coronavirus too, which meant I wouldn’t be allowed to see him or hold his hand.” The inquest heard how Coolio’s mother tested positive after giving birth. Maternal Covid-19 was listed as a secondary cause of his death. His brain had also been starved of blood and oxygen due to another condition. June 2020 One of the many health workers who fell victim to the virus as they worked to save other people from it, Richzeal Albufera was a biomedical scientist at Castle Hill hospital in Cottingham, near Hull. His death with Covid on 9 June at Hull Royal Infirmary prompted a fundraising campaign to repatriate his body to the Philippines. His widow was moved to offer her thanks when the £10,000 target was met, as she acknowledged the “caring messages” she had received from wellwishers. July 2020 The 91-year-old tested positive for Covid while receiving hospital treatment for a fractured femur, having tested negative when he arrived at the facility. Within two months, he had died – with an inquest hearing later that Covid had been a contributory factor. Dick Lukehurst’s wife, Thelma, said that, while he later appeared to be free of infection, it had “done a lot of damage” to his body. “Being in that bed alone and unable to move must have been hell for him,” she told the Kent Messenger. Recalling one of their final conversations, she told the paper: “He told me not to reproach myself and that we had had 43 wonderful years together. After that he was just too weak to hold the phone. Being so cut off from his family and alone broke his spirit completely. “I was the only one allowed to visit. His son, Paul, didn’t see him in all the time he was in hospital, which was very sad for them both.” August 2020 Andrea Maftei, a cafe worker, became the first person to die in Northern Ireland after a four-day reprieve during which the authorities had recorded no deaths in summer 2020. Maftei, originally from Romania, was described as a “trusted employee [and] a very loyal friend” by colleagues, who said they were “astounded at the news [of her death] and utterly heartbroken”. According to the BBC, her father spoke of his anguish that restrictions meant she had “left us far away in Ireland in a hospital bed”, saying: “Our daughter Andrea passed away among the angels, killed by this miserable virus at only 32 years old.” September 2020 The 79-year-old John Fleming died as an outbreak struck patients and staff at Craigavon Area Hospital, in Co Armagh. Fleming’s death followed his admission to the haematology ward for bone cancer treatment. The BBC reported that the father of four was one of two haematology patients with Covid-19 to die within 48 hours at the hospital. His daughter, Yvonne Stewart, said she wanted her father’s death to serve as a warning. “This could happen to anybody, anywhere. I’ve such an ache in my heart, we all have. People need to wise up. Yes, you may get Covid, and it might be a mild attack, but you could pass that on to somebody else unwittingly, who passes that on to their parents or somebody who is very, very ill already.” October 2020 The moment Roehl Ribaya left Blackpool Victoria hospital to applause from staff in July 2020 was heralded by one senior medic as an indication that the hospital had “survived the first wave of this silent killer”. But Ribaya never fully recovered from the illness and died on 15 October, having slipped into a coma two days earlier. When he returned home after his lengthy stay in hospital for treatment for Covid, he frequently struggled for breath and to carry out even straightforward tasks, such as walking up the stairs. “He was depressed when he came out of the hospital because he is 47 and should be fit and well but he felt like a 90-year-old man,” said his close friend, Mark Delabajam, at the time. November 2020 Sonia Partridge was described as the “backbone of our family”, who “put magic into everything she did” by her partner after her death at the age of 35 on 17 November. Partridge, a mother to 13 children, “loved everyone with a passion”, Kerry Ann Partridge said. She added: “I just walk into a room and expect to see her and she’s not there. I’m watching the younger children running around like nothing has changed, and it’s very hard to accept she’s never going to see them grow up. “It’s left a massive hole in all our lives. It’s hard telling the little ones she’s gone away with the angels and she’s not coming home.” December 2020 Aged just 25 when Covid killed her on 30 December, Lauren Jones’ family said her death should serve as a warning to the country that the virus was claiming the young as well as the elderly. Her father, Paul Jones, told the Guardian he believed Lauren fell ill so quickly she did not have the chance to fight the virus. “It’s shocked everyone,” he said. “People just don’t realise what can happen with this virus. It is taking lives and can take young lives too. Sadly it took Lauren’s. It must have taken its grip so quickly on her she never really had the chance to fight it. It all happened so quickly.” January 2021 The teacher and charity volunteer Claudia Marsh, whose relatives said “loved giving back to people less fortunate than herself” died on 20 January – her 25th birthday. During her life, she worked with the Merseyside-based charities Talking Eating Disorders (TEDS) and the Whitechapel Centre, where she had previously sought help for her own eating disorder. “Claudia was very special, kind, caring and a dedicated teacher,” said family friend Leigh Best, the founder of TEDS. Best added: “She was full of positivity, kindness and hope, and had a smile that would brighten up the whole room.” February 2021 The NHS nurse from Croydon reportedly turned down remote working in favour of caring for patients in person. Her son, Colin Udeagbala, said she had inspired her whole family to go into healthcare, telling reporters. “My family is full of NHS workers and it all started from my mum, all the inspiration came from her,” he said. “She was first and we saw her do it then everybody started to follow suit. “That’s what she wanted for all of us, to study medicine or study nursing … to help people. She instilled in us to care for others and that’s it’s not just a job. She was just a wonderful lady, always going above and beyond for others.” He described how she had ignored the possibility of working remotely, adding: “She didn’t listen and wanted to have direct contact, she loved the job. She was all about caring for one another, loving one another, no matter your race or background, and she was loved by everybody.” March 2021 Margaret Waine, a healthcare assistant, died on 1 March 2021. Waine, who was 64, had worked for St Helens and Knowsley teaching hospitals NHS trust since 1981. According to the Nursing Standard, she was a mother to Michael, Elizabeth and Gregory, and grandmother to Olivia and Mason. The trust’s chief executive said: “Margaret was a much-loved member of staff, always kind and caring towards her patients and colleagues. She will be greatly missed by everyone at the trust.” April 2021 Rev John Anderson lost his life due to Covid on 17 April 2021, when he was 46. He had been rector of Billy and Derrykeighan, in Ireland, since June 2005. According to the Diocese of Connor, Anderson – a Church of Ireland clergyman – became ill around a week before his death, and died in the Intensive Care Unit of Causeway Hospital, Coleraine. The Bishop of Connor, the Right Rev George Davison, paid tribute to Anderson, saying: “John Anderson’s death has come as a terrible shock to us all. “He will be missed by so many people, but none more so than his wife Eleanor and their precious children.” May 2021 The former ambulance technician George Cairns died aged 71 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley after testing positive for coronavirus nine days earlier. Cains had been director of Bipolar Scotland, as ran the Glasgow group of the organisation, and according to Bipolar Scotland he was a “big presence in the organisation over the years”. According to the BBC, his daughter, Gillian, paid tribute to his caring nature, saying: “Even if you only met him once he would tell you a story, a terrible joke or offer a supportive ear when you needed it the most.” June 2021 Julie Lewis was 66 when she died of Covid-19. The former nurse died six days before her birthday. Her daughter, Lucy, was vocal in calling for an inquiry into how the pandemic was handled. “My mum was everyone’s mum – nobody was not welcome around our house. She was the warmest person, and would do anything for anyone. Her whole life was dedicated to looking after others so much so that she put herself last,” she added. July 2021 John Eyers was a “fit and healthy” 42-year-old who died of Covid-19 in July 2021, with friends describing him as “incredibly fit” and “one of the most active and fit people” they knew. Paying tribute to her twin brother, Jenny McCann said that his death was “a tragedy”, and also detailed why he was unvaccinated at the time of his death. “He thought if he contracted Covid-19 he would be OK. He thought he would have a mild illness. He didn’t want to put a vaccine in his body. His was pumped full of every drug in the hospital. They threw everything at him,” McCann said on Twitter. “It should not have happened. He leaves a mum and a dad, a sister (me), and a 19-year-old daughter. My two children have lost their fun uncle. The uncle who would always play with them.” August 2021 Samantha Willis was only 35 when she died of Covid-19, after spending 16 days in hospital. She was unable to hold her newborn baby daughter before she passed away. Her husband, Josh Willis, said that he tried to arrange for her to hold her child before her condition had worsened. “She carried her for eight months but she never held her in her arms … the one thing I wanted was for her to see her baby and to hold her,” told the BBC. Willis had not been vaccinated for Covid-19 when she died – her husband said he wanted to raise vaccination awareness after his wife’s death. “I just want to put her story out there … I think if she could help one person, one family, she would be happy,” he said. September 2021 Veronica Guy, who worked as a senior staff nurse at County hospital in Stafford for more than 20 years, died in September 2021 at Royal Stoke University Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent. Sally Davies, a colleague, paid tribute to her in the Nursing Standard, saying: “She was an advocate for her patients, having had a renal transplant herself, and was able to share her lived experience with our patients. “She was incredibly well known and extremely loved by her colleagues at County hospital.” October 2021 In early October 2021, it was reported that Jorja Halliday, 15, from Portsmouth, died of coronavirus on the day that she was due to receive her vaccine. Her mother, Tracey Halliday, described her daughter as a “loving girl”. She said: “She was very active, she liked to go out and spend time with her friends and loved spending time with her brothers and sisters. “Growing up, she turned into a beautiful young lady, always wanting to help others, always there for everybody. It’s heart-wrenching because your kids are always meant to outlive you and that’s the one thing I can’t get over.” November 2021 Irfan Halim was a doctor working in the intensive care unit at Swindon hospital, when he contracted coronavirus and died nine weeks after testing positive. Siân Hughes-Pollitt, a family friend who met the doctor through a school fencing club, told the Evening Standard that Halim’s death had left “an enormous gap in many places and spaces”. She said he would frequently commute for more than two hours from his home in Barking to Swindon to treat patients. “Irfan had a kind word for everybody,” she said. “It is so difficult to accept that a man who took every medical and clinical precaution against Covid died of the disease.” She added: “When I picture him now, I see him standing beside his wife and family – a tower of strength. He is the husband, the dad, the best friend. I see him living through his wife and children.” Hughes-Pollitt said she had spoken to Halim’s wife, Saila, hours after she watched her husband pass away in intensive care. “She was broken … The first thing she told me was: ‘He went out to work and he never came home.’” December 2021 Fila Lutu was just 37 and weeks away from receiving her first coronavirus vaccination when she died in December 2021. Her brother, Christopher David Lutu, said at the time that it felt like she has been “snatched away from us”. “She was an amazing person in the family. It’s going to leave a hole,” he added. Although the family are devastated by their loss, Lutu hopes that, even after her death, Fila will still be able to continue helping people. He had fundraised for the local hospital in her memory, and hopes that her experience will encourage others to get vaccinated as quickly as possible. “I’d say, if you’re going to get it anyway, do it as soon as possible and don’t delay it, because we don’t know if it would have changed anything.” January 2022 Fiona Denison, an academic at the University of Edinburgh, died after a long battle with ­Covid-19 on 9 January 2022. Denison, who was a professor in the department of reproductive health at the university, was 51 when she died. She was credited with contributing to award-winning research into reproductive health “which changed the health outcomes for mothers and babies in Scotland and beyond”. Many paid tribute to her, including Alan Denison, her brother, who said on social media: “My sister Fiona Denison died yesterday following a long battle with Covid. A gifted, kind and compassionate obstetrician, researcher, teacher, academic, musician, friend, wife, mother, auntie and daughter. RIP.” February 2022 Jon Wain, 49, who worked as a police officer for Greater Manchester police for more than 17 years, died in February after contracting coronavirus. Brett Grange, one of Wain’s colleagues, paid tribute to him in the Manchester Evening News, saying: “I last saw Jon late last year walking his dog, we had a brief socially distant chat on the street and I left him with the words ‘look after yourself Jon’ – as we both knew as an operational officer he faced enhanced risk. “He faced that risk gallantly and we have all lost a true gentleman to this horrible virus.” “Our thoughts are with Jon’s family, friends and close colleagues at this very sad time, and we will be supporting them as best we can.” Wain leaves behind his partner and two children.",News/World news,"Two years of Covid grief: tributes to family, friends and colleagues who died in the UK",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/two-years-of-covid-grief-tributes-to-family-friends-and-colleagues-who-died-in-the-uk
3/23/2022,"Long Covid could create a generation affected by disability, with people forced out of their homes and work, and some even driven to suicide, a leading expert has warned. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Prof Danny Altmann – an immunologist at Imperial College London – said that the UK’s current approach to Covid fails to take the impact of infections sufficiently seriously, adding that more needs to be done to aid diagnosis and treatment of long Covid. “It’s kind of an anathema to me that we’ve kind of thrown in the towel on control of Omicron wave infections and have said ‘it’s endemic, and we don’t care any more, because it’s very benign’,” he said. “It just isn’t. And there are new people joining the long Covid support groups all the time with their disabilities. It’s really not OK, and it’s heartbreaking.” According to data from the Office for National Statistics, by the end of January this year about 1.5 million people – or 2.4% of the population – in the UK said they were experiencing ongoing symptoms more than four weeks after their first suspected Covid infection, with 45% reporting that infection was a year or more ago. The findings chime with a recent UK study that found only around one in three patients who had ongoing Covid symptoms after being hospitalised with the disease reported feeling fully recovered a year later. Asked whether long Covid could lead to a generation affected by disability, Altmann agreed. “Totally,” he said. But he emphasised that long Covid is not limited to the UK. “This is a global problem,” said Altmann. “We’ve got at least 5 million people on the planet with long Covid – [that is] very much a lower limit estimate. And they’ve all got a wide array of problems and they are big problems. It’s going to drive people out of housing, out of work and in some cases, to suicide.” An expert on T-cells and autoimmunity, Altmann has recently teamed up with journalist Gez Medinger – who himself has long Covid – to write the Long Covid Handbook, set to be published later this year. For Altmann, the decision to become involved in research into Covid and its ongoing impact was a no-brainer. “We were people who had decade’s worth of viral immunology, and autoimmunity. So, you know, what else we’ve been training for?” he said. But long Covid is far from simple. One study has suggested the condition is associated with more than 200 symptoms, from brain fog to heart palpitations, while microscopic damage to the lungs, microclots and low levels of certain antibodies are among the mechanisms experts have suggested could be linked to long Covid. One problem, said Altmann, is that different groups of researchers are all following their own favourite hypotheses. “All the scientists and medics working in this mean really, really well,” he said. But, he added: “I think we’ve all got to kind of put our egos to one side and get out of our silos.” Perhaps unsurprisingly, however, Altmann believes his own field could play an important role. “I think that some of the immunological hypotheses can form a kind of unifying umbrella for lots of those things, in the same way as lupus is a very diverse disease that is all at the end downstream consequences of a relatively focused autoimmune assault,” he said. The idea appears to match data suggesting long Covid is more common in women. “Nearly every autoimmune disease I’ve ever looked at is quite skewed towards women,” said Altmann, adding it is not difficult to see how sex hormones could be involved in immune regulation. But Altmann seems dismayed at a lack of urgency, or appreciation of the devastation long Covid can bring, among those in power. On Tuesday a report published by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on coronavirus found the UK government’s policymaking on Covid has “continuously failed” to take long Covid into account and has not “adequately funded” research into treatments for the condition. “We’ve kind of paid lip service to it, and not really taken it sufficiently seriously,” said Altmann, adding that while long Covid clinics have been set up in the UK they vary enormously in terms of the service they offer. And there is, potentially, another cause for unease: Altmann notes some people who were infected with the earlier Sars coronavirus were still experiencing symptoms eight years later. Altman said an important step is to tackle the rising Covid infection level in the UK, adding the debate should not be polarised to “pro-lockdown” or “pro-Covid”. “Then we need to be seriously joined up on our efforts to work out what long Covid is and how we’re going to diagnose it and how we are to treat it,” he said. One frustration, keenly felt by many of those living with long Covid, is the slow pace of research. It is an issue Altmann appreciates, although he maintains standards must be kept. “I think, alright, research projects around the world have been put in place. But it’s hard to imagine that they’re going to deliver the big answers in less than nine to 12 months from now,” he said. When asked what has surprised him most about long Covid, Altmann’s answer is stark: “Partly just how ghastly and pernicious and prevalent it is,” he said, adding another surprise was new cases emerged even among those who have been vaccinated. For Altmann, the current Covid situation in countries from Scotland to Hong Kong is no reason to be sanguine. “You can’t just shut your eyes and turn away and say I’ve lost interest and it’s not a problem to me any more,” he said. “Because the virus calls you out on that.”",News/Society,"Long Covid could create a generation affected by disability, expert warns",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/23/long-covid-could-create-a-generation-affected-by-disability-expert-warns
3/23/2022,"On 23 March 2020, the day on which the prime minister announced the first UK lockdown, just over 1,000 people had died of a new and frightening coronavirus. Two years later, that figure now stands at above 188,000. The UK endured several more lockdowns over the next two years as new variants emerged and cases soared, causing unprecedented disruption. But as 2021 wore on, the vaccine rollout gave cause for optimism, with numbers of deaths and seriously ill patients on ventilators lower during the most recent Omicron wave than in previous spikes. However, as we mark the two-year anniversary of the first lockdown, some experts are concerned that cases are increasing again just as the government has ended all Covid restrictions and intends to phase out free testing. In Scotland, the number of Covid patients in hospitals has reached its highest ever level. Dr Simon Clarke, biology professor at the University of Reading, said: “I understand that the UK government is keen to stop spending on expensive testing infrastructure, and people have had enough of isolation requirements. “But the government must be careful not to dismantle all the systems which have allowed UK planners to stay ahead of the Omicron wave through a successful vaccination drive.” The UK’s Covid-19 case rate has risen throughout March and stood at 832 per 100,000 residents on average in the week to 16 March. The rise has been partly attributed to the highly infectious Omicron B.2 variant. Scotland has seen the sharpest rise in cases, with 1,639 new cases per 100,000 reported on average in the same week, its highest figure since mid-January. In England and Wales, case rates are lower but have been rising throughout March to reach 780 per 100,000 and 392 per 100,000 respectively. In Northern Ireland, rolling case rates have been falling for several days but remained at 787 per 100,000 in the week to 16 March. The latest ONS infection survey, which does not rely on individuals getting tested but extrapolates a sample over the whole population, estimated that 1 in 20 people in England had Covid-19, compared to 1 in 14 in Scotland and Northern Ireland and 1 in 25 in Wales. The number of people living with “long Covid” – whose common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog and chronic pain – remains a concern as the government ploughs ahead with its “living with Covid” plan. An estimated 1.5 million people living in private households – or just over 2% of the population – were experiencing self-reported long Covid, according to the Office for National Statistics. Of this group, an estimated, 344,000 (22%) first had (or suspected they had) Covid-19 less than 12 weeks ago, 1.1 million (71%) first had it at least 12 weeks previously, and 685,000 (45%) first had it at least one year previously. Around two-thirds of those experiencing long Covid symptoms said their ability to undertake day-to-day activities had been limited. A separate ONS survey on social attitudes to the pandemic revealed that some disabled people remain concerned about the future. They were almost two times less likely to think that their life had returned to normal (6%) than non-disabled people (11%) as of February. The number of Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals has been rising throughout March and stood at 13,876 as of 18 March, according to the seven-day average figure. However it remains well below the peak of 38,400 seen in January 2021. However, while cases soared last winter, the number of patients on mechanical ventilation was much lower than in previous waves, in part due to the success of the vaccine rollout. The number of patients on ventilators has been falling since January, and stood at 287 patients UK-wide as of 18 March, compared to a peak of over 4,000 in January 2021. There have been 188,078 deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate as of 11 March, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. London has had the highest death rate of any region over the course of the pandemic, with 171 deaths per 100,000 residents, according to age-standardised mortality rates from the ONS at the end of January. It is important to adjust for age when comparing death rates due to the increased vulnerability of older age groups. The north-west had the next highest rate, with 157 deaths per 100,000, while the south-west had the lowest rate by some distance, with 69 per 100,000. The economic impact of the pandemic was initially devastating: GDP declined by 9.7% in 2020, the steepest fall since consistent records began in 1948, according to the House of Commons Library. This was followed by growth in spring 2021, leaving GDP 0.5% below pre-pandemic levels in October 2021. Other business estimates also show signs of economic recovery. The proportion of companies open for business was 94% in February, the highest level since June 2020, according to the ONS Business Impact Survey. Three in 10 businesses had cash reserves to last six months or more as of January, up from 22% a year earlier, according to the same survey. A higher proportion – 38% said their cash reserves would last less than three months. However the survey also showed approximately one in six (16%) businesses experienced global supply chain disruption in the last month; this is unchanged from January 2022.

3/23/2022,"Online sexual harassment rose sharply for university students during Covid-19 lockdowns and remote learning, including on private messages during Zoom lectures, a report has found. The national student safety survey, released by Universities Australia on Wednesday, found one in 20 students had been sexually assaulted since starting university and one in six had been sexually harassed. The survey of 43,189 students was conducted by the Societal Research Centre. Rates of harassment and assault were highest for gender diverse students, with 13.7% of transgender students and 22.4% of non-binary students saying they had experienced sexual harassment since staring university. Students who lived in on campus accommodation or student housing were also more likely to have experienced sexual assault or harassment, with 6% reporting having been sexually assaulted in the past 12 months, compared with 1.1% of the student body as a whole. Interviews with 1,800 students revealed an increase in online harassment. Students said they had been “pestered” to send nude photos by fellow students or been sent nude photos without their consent. They also reported having male students “message me inappropriately during online classes”. Prof John Dewar, chair of Universities Australia, said the survey results were “distressing, disappointing and confronting”. “As a nation, this cannot be tolerated, and as a sector, we will continue to be part of the solution,” he said. Dewar offered an “unreserved apology” to those affected. “To every single University student who has experienced sexual harassment or sexual assault, or has a friend, family member or loved one who has – I am sorry,” he said, in a video statement released alongside the report. “I am sorry for what you endured. I am sorry for how that may have affected your relationships, your mental health, your studies and your life.” The figures in the 2021 survey showed some improvement on those in a landmark 2016 survey conducted by the Australian Human Rights Commission, but the change has been slow. Only 3% of students who were sexually harassed while at university and 5.6% of those who were sexually assaulted made a formal report to their education institution about the incident. And of those who reported, half felt the university did not explain the complaints process to them. Just 41.3% of those who reported sexual harassment and 29.7% of those who experienced sexual assault were satisfied with the reporting process. Universities Australia cautioned against direct comparisons between the 2016 and 2021 because the survey methodology had changed.",News/Australia news,‘Distressing and confronting’: online sexual harassment rises for Australian university students during Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/23/distressing-and-confronting-online-sexual-harassment-rises-for-australian-university-students-during-covid
3/23/2022,Britain’s annual inflation rate rose to 6.2% in February and now stands at its highest level in three decades. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed a jump in the government’s preferred measure of the cost of living from 5.5% in January. The February inflation figure for the consumer prices index was higher than the 5.9% predicted by a Reuters poll of economists. Further increases in the annual inflation rate are expected as higher motoring costs triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and April’s increase in domestic energy prices take effect. The Bank of England said last week it expected inflation to be about 8% in April with the risk of a double digit increase in the Autumn if there is another sharp increase in the energy price cap.,News/Business,"UK inflation hits 6.2%, the highest level in three decades",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/23/uk-inflation-highest-level-in-three-decades
3/23/2022,"I have been living with exposed asbestos in my flat for nearly four years and my housing association, Notting Hill Genesis (NHG), has repeatedly ignored my calls to have it removed. The problem came to light in 2017 when a carpenter, who was repairing a board covering a disused fireplace in my bedroom, discovered it contained asbestos. Four other areas of asbestos were then found in the living areas. Masking tape was used to seal them, but nothing has been done since. I am a 73-year-old African with various health conditions and have also had to endure a rotten kitchen floor and a holed, cracked wall which have become an entry route for vermin and bed bugs. In 2020, after two years without action, I was told surveyors were only attending urgent cases. Months later, four appointments were cancelled by NHG. I asked to pay for an independent surveyor to inspect my flat and reclaim the cost from NHG, but was refused. I am being treated for post traumatic stress disorder which I attribute to the appalling conditions.SA, London Photos of the flat where you’ve lived for 30 years make shocking viewing. They show mildewed woodwork, decaying wall plaster, gaping holes between fixtures and a collection of bed bugs. Plus thin strips of tape covering the walls where asbestos has been exposed. NHG says you were unable to make several appointments it suggested before the pandemic put a hold on repair work, a claim you deny, but it admits it should not have let it drag on so long. “The sticky tape was a short-term measure to identify where the asbestos was. As long as the area was not disturbed it was deemed low-risk,” it says. “The job should have been picked up when restrictions were lifted, but unfortunately this was not the case. We’re sorry the resident was left in this situation for such a long period and we’ve assessed our processes to make sure this doesn’t happen again.” Four days after I raised your plight, NHG managed to dispatch a surveyor who recommended extensive renovations. The asbestos was removed soon afterwards, and a new kitchen was installed in December. You were paid £1,800 for the disruption during the works, but your problems were not over. You claim that a substandard installation left you with holes in the kitchen wall. NHG initially contested this, but has now finally acknowledged it was wrong. You also say you are still blighted by bed bugs: NHG says its pest-control team was unable to find evidence of these when they visited. It promised to return for another inspection. In January NHG, which manages more than 66,500 homes, announced a procurement plan worth nearly £2bn to invest, among other things, in upgrading kitchens. I hope other tenants can get their homes overhauled without the long hard battle you’ve endured. Email your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

3/23/2022,"Haven’t heard of BimboTok? Then it’s time to wake up and smell the lip gloss. It’s a subsection of TikTok where self-proclaimed bimbos are proudly reclaiming the title. A bit of fun. You won’t catch me trying to stand in the way of evolving language. My efforts to keep up with the right words to use often feel like standing in a rough sea while the waves smash me in and out, occasionally flooring me. Thrilling, if precarious. Take my own sexuality. I experimented with identifying as pansexual only to find out from Twitter that I had accidentally “erased” bisexuality. I didn’t know I was able to do that, let alone all by myself. I don’t know if you’ve ever felt simultaneous sadness, shame and incredible power, but it’s very confusing. Eventually, I settled on “queer” as my personal badge of honour. The only problem with that is that the boomers in my life are baffled. “We’ve only just stopped using that one as a slur.” I paraphrase, but they have. There’s no way that isn’t the future waiting for me, too. I can picture my six-year-old, in a decade’s time, muttering to his mates: “Oh my God, did you just hear my mum say ‘neurodivergent’? Ugh. The shame.” It’s funny and I think really valuable to acknowledge that many of the words we’re using now in an effort to be as kind as possible will, at some point, be the wrong ones. So let’s get into bimbogate. What is it? And why is it making me laugh? A prominent self-proclaimed bimbo called Chlapecka describes a bimbo as being “a leftist who likes to have their tits out”. I mean, what’s not to love? This bit. Another bimbo called Princess Faux Rich explains that a modern reclaimed bimbo is “a hyper-feminine person”. They must be pro-surgery while also being “truly authentically themselves”. I see. It’s about being “loved and respected by being themselves without having to change who they are”. Well, maybe don’t advocate people paying surgeons to physically change who they are, then. Nip and tuck that one flaw in the plan, though, and I’ve gone from thinking, “Well, we wouldn’t reclaim the term ‘silly sausage’,” to becoming a bimbo-ally. A bimbally. TikTok’s revolutionary bimbos hold firm that women can wear whatever they want, however revealing it is. Yes please. They’re against the far right, including pro-lifers. So far, so fabulous. They are fiercely inclusive, carefully inviting all genders to revel in their glorious bimbodom. Lovely. And they are furious at the term bimbo being used by misogynists to claim that women can’t be beautiful and brainy. I mean, I thought Carol Vorderman had sorted that out for us decades ago, but the important thing is, sentiment-wise: hard agree. These new, improved bimbos delight in the “pink and the girly”, and good on them. At this stage, I should admit that no one has ever called or will ever call me a bimbo. I’ve got brown hair and miniature knockers and if it weren’t for the cruelty of time melting my face, I’d barely even bother with makeup. But I get it. Of course, we should celebrate taking pride in our appearances, if that’s something that brings those people joy, let alone power and purpose. I love these bimbos showing that a feminist doesn’t have to look like one type of person or another. And Princess Faux Rich’s argument that it’s as important to know the number of Justin Bieber’s social media followers as it is to know astrophysics is funny. I’m delighted to welcome the term “bimbo” into the once-banished cannon. “Babe”, “slut” and “bitch” have been waiting for you in there with very open arms.

3/23/2022,"Julian Assange’s fiancee has told how she believes authorities blocked journalists from the couple’s witnesses on their wedding day at Belmarsh prison because they don’t want him being seen as a “human being”. The WikiLeaks co-founder was granted permission last year to marry Stella Moris – with whom he has two children – at the prison where he has been held since 2019 after the US took legal action to extradite him to face trial on espionage charges. In an article for the Guardian ahead of her wedding on Wednesday, Moris describes the wedding venue as “the most oppressive high-security prison in the country”. Moris, a lawyer, is expected to arrive at the prison in south London shortly before noon wearing a dress designed by two supporters of Assange – Dame Vivienne Westwood and Andreas Kronthaler. But she also writes of how, behind the scenes, the couple have been locked in a dispute with the Ministry of Justice and prison authorities, who she says have denied their proposed witnesses because they are journalists. A proposed photographer has also been denied because he also works for the press, even though they would all attend in a private capacity, she added. “The prison states that our wedding picture is a security risk because it could end up in social media or the press,” she writes. “How absurd. What kind of security threat could a wedding picture pose?” Belmarsh regularly permits photography, says Moris, adding that the far-right activist Tommy Robinson and other convicted prisoners were allowed to be interviewed on camera when ITV filmed inside Belmarsh prison. “But for Julian, who isn’t even serving a sentence, there appear to be a different set of rules. What are they so afraid of? I am convinced that they fear that people will see Julian as a human being. Not a name, but a person. Their fear reveals that they want Julian to remain invisible to the public at all costs, even on his wedding day, and especially on his wedding day. For him to disappear from public consciousness.” The couple – who will be married by the prison registrar – will be joined by their two children, Assange’s father and brother, and the sister and mother of the bride. Moris is expected to cut a wedding cake and give a speech after the ceremony has concluded. Instead of sending gifts, supporters have been asked to donate to a crowdfunder campaign supporting his battle against the US government’s bid to extradite him. A Prison Service spokesperson said: “All weddings in prisons must meet the requirements outlined in the Prison Service policy.’ They added that photography for weddings in prisons is facilitated by prison staff, in line with established national policy on photographing prisoners and that policy makes clear the governor can block images being taken if it is believed they will be shared publicly, which can compromise prison security. As a result, photos are taken by prison staff, they said. Earlier this month, Assange moved a step closer to a US trial on espionage charges after the UK’s highest court refused to hear his appeal against extradition. He was attempting to appeal against a judgment by the high court in December that ruled he could be extradited after assurances from the US authorities with regard to his prison conditions there. But the supreme court said it had refused permission to appeal “as the application didn’t raise an arguable point of law”. After the decision, the case is expected to be formally sent to the home secretary, Priti Patel, to approve the extradition. Assange’s lawyers have had a number of weeks to make submissions to the home secretary before her decision. Other routes to fight his extradition remain, for instance by mounting a challenge on other issues of law raised at first instance that he lost on and have not yet been subject to appeal.",News/Media,Julian Assange’s fiancee believes journalists barred from wedding so he is not seen as ‘human’,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/23/julian-assanges-fiancee-believes-journalists-barred-from-wedding-so-he-is-not-seen-as-human
3/23/2022,"Estonia is calling for Nato to abandon its current “tripwire” posture in eastern Europe and build up a permanent force in the region capable of stopping a Russian offensive. Ahead of Thursday’s Nato summit, Jonatan Vseviov, the permanent secretary of the Estonian foreign ministry, said the Europe and the North Atlantic alliance could never return to the world it knew before the 24 February Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We will be in a totally new security environment. There will be a new Ukraine. There will be a new Russia. There will be a new Europe. There is no going back to February 23,” Vseviov told the Guardian in an interview in Washington. More than 20,000 Nato troops, the overwhelming majority of them US forces, have been deployed to the Baltic states, Poland and the rest of eastern Europe in the aftermath of the invasion. There had previously only been a few thousand alliance forces in the region, intended to serve as a tripwire which would be overrun in the event of a Russian attack. The presence of US and western European soldiers among them, however, was intended to leave Moscow in no doubt that those countries would send in large reinforcements. Vseviov, a former Estonian ambassador to Washington argued that the Kremlin had miscalculated so badly in Ukraine – over its own military strength, Ukrainian capability and determination, and western resolve – that it could no longer be taken for granted Moscow would get the message, and believe Nato reinforcements would come to the rescue. “The tripwire– based approach is dependent upon an assumption that the one that is being deterred understands the link between the tripwire and reinforcing forces,” he said. “Knowing this and understanding that we need to now build Nato’s defense and deterrence, and European security in general, for the long haul,” Vseviov said. “We need to move from a tripwire-based deterrence towards a forward defence-based deterrence, or a deterrence by denial, if you will.” He said the amount of troops and equipment needed would depend on military planners and on different situations in different countries. The force did not have to be big enough to stop Russia making any territorial gains, but sufficient to put up stiff resistance. “We need to be less reliant on reinforcements, and we need to have more of the defensive forces in the frontline states on day one,” Vseviov said. “I think there will be wide political consensus in Nato on the need to move that way, and the exact details are being worked out.” The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, confirmed that long-term changes in Nato’s posture in Europe would be discussed this week. “Right now, our secretary of defence and the supreme allied commander in Europe believe that they have an effective posture today for what’s necessary today,” Sullivan said. “The second [question] is what is the longer-term force posture, not just for this contingency, this emergency, this invasion, but over the course of time? That is something the president will discuss with his allies at the Nato summit on Thursday.” Since the end of the cold war, Nato’s ability to move armies from west to east has decayed. Retired rear admiral Mark Montgomery, a former deputy director for plans, policy and strategy at US European Command, said the number of rail carriages for transporting tanks and other heavy equipment diminished from the high hundreds to a handful, for example. The infrastructure has only recently begun to be rebuilt. “I think this actually shows that the Baltic plan to try to get the United States further and further integrated with increasingly larger sets of units is the right play,” Montgomery, now a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies thinktank, said. “You want the US with boots on the ground from day one.”",News/World news,"Nato needs permanent force in eastern Europe to deter Russia, says Estonia",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/estonia-nato-tripwire-eastern-europe-ukraine-russia
3/23/2022,"When refugee crises occur, I think of my late father, Karel Reisz. A celebrated film-maker, he was someone who helped radically transform British cinema during the 1950s and 1960s. But in early 1939, at the age of just 12, he left his family behind for ever and set off on the last Kindertransport from Prague – shortly before the Germans took over Czechoslovakia and closed the borders – and became a child refugee in the UK. His knowledge of English then was restricted to the name of the former prime minister, “good old Mr Baldwin”, and the remedy an uncle used for his stomach problems, “Carter’s little liver pills”. If my father hadn’t been saved, his three sons, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren wouldn’t be here today. That’s why I support an openhearted welcome for those fleeing persecution anywhere and have been deeply unimpressed by the responses of recent British governments. Yet what is happening in Ukraine feels even closer to home. It is partly a question of geography, the constant evocation of the Kindertransports and the parallels drawn between Adolf Hitler and Vladimir Putin. But what makes it even more poignant for me is that my oldest grandchild, one of my favourite people in the world, turns 12 at the end of this month. She has just hit puberty. Often, she flicks her beautiful long hair into a “Fabulous fashion show!” and she shows signs of incipient teenage moodiness. But she is also still very much a little girl who takes comfort from cuddly toys when she is sad. She is the age my father was when forced to flee, but it is almost unimaginable to think of her having to cross Europe to make a new life for herself alone, though there will surely be cases of Ukrainian children being forced right now to do just that. Reflecting on her – and what my father went through – helps me clarify just why the recent actions of the British government have been so appalling. The Kindertransports were an essentially private initiative by people such as Nicholas Winton, to whom the government eventually gave their rather reluctant support, provided the sponsors agreed to pay £50 to ensure that the incoming children would not be a financial burden on the state. It was the saving and the making of my father, who became a central figure in the Free Cinema movement of the 1950s, determined to get out of the barracks, the castle and the drawing room, and to put very different aspects of British life on screen. Films such as Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960) were applauded as a breath of fresh air even by the rightwing press, not least because they offered powerful new outsider perspectives on English society. The French Lieutenant’s Woman, his 1981 success, was nominated for five Oscars. And he was not alone. Many other refugees and émigrés of the time made a deep impact on our national life. There is talk now about the risks; to security, of safeguarding, and certainly there were cases of Kindertransport abuse, when sponsors took in children because they were looking for cheap servants or because they felt they had a mission to convert Jews to Christianity. The much larger numbers of Jewish women allowed into the UK to work in domestic service sometimes faced harassment or cruelty. So it might make sense to impose checks on those offering to host Ukrainians. What is inexcusable is any policy that further traumatises already deeply traumatised refugees. All this should be obvious to a cabinet that includes people whose families experienced persecution. Dominic Raab comes from a paternal Czech-Jewish background similar to my own; Nadhim Zahawi left Iraq in 1979 at the age of nine, near the start of Saddam Hussein’s regime; and Priti Patel is the daughter of Ugandan Asians who fled to the UK shortly before Idi Amin ordered them all to be expelled. Yet at the Conservative party spring conference last weekend, the home secretary struck a familiar note of shrill patriotic paranoia. She called it “naive and misguided to think that only men can be covert operatives, or that refugee flows could not be subject to some form of exploitation”, warning darkly of people coming to this country “who plot to strike at our very way of life”. Only four years ago, said Patel, “the Russian military intelligence services used a chemical weapon on British soil”. Is it not possible to tell the difference between the spies from central casting who carried out the Salisbury poisoning and the desperate Ukrainian refugees we see on our television screens every day? And do we now regard children too as potential “covert operatives”? Where would that approach have left my father; what would it have meant for the contribution he and so many others made to British life? Is it really too much to ask that our guiding principle should be compassion, not suspicion?

3/23/2022,"The last run of the day is often a scrum as everyone hurtles down the same slope in pursuit of an après-ski beer. As the afternoon light faded, I was cruising from the 3,000-metre Col de Thorens down an empty piste, wondering where everyone else was. Val Thorens, probably, or Les Menuires or Méribel. But here in little Orelle, on the fringe of France’s Trois Vallées, you wouldn’t know you were in the largest ski domain in the world. That’s the beauty of these small back-door resorts: you get a share of 600km of slopes but you’re not in the thick of the crowds – nor paying top whack. And that back door has become considerably easier (and cheaper) to open with the arrival of two new cable cars in Orelle. One whizzes you up from the village to the ski area of Plan Bouchet at 2,350 metres, replacing an older, slower lift. But the big news is the Orelle-Caron cable car that takes you directly to Val Thorens and its 150km of slopes, opening up the highest resort in the Trois Vallées to pedestrians as well as skiers. As the ski season here is currently slated to stay open until 8 May, that leaves plenty of time for spring skiing on high-altitude slopes. Orelle itself is less a village and more a series of 10 minuscule blink-and-you-miss-them hamlets scattered around zigzagging roads. It’s a sleepy slice of Savoie, its traditional stone cottages mingling with more modern chalets and residences. It’s as far as you can get – economically and spiritually – from the Trois Vallées’ northernmost outpost of Courchevel. Budget, not bling, is the key word in Orelle where an apartment in Le Hameau des Eaux d’Orelle residence, where I was based, costs from €520 in April for a week for four. To say the accommodation is basic is somewhat of an understatement (bring your own soap, cleaning supplies, etc), and there are extra charges for towels, linen and a final cleaning. But there is an indoor pool, hot tub and sauna, not to mention a decently stocked (and well-priced) food shop and a good restaurant and bar. It’s a 10-minute cab ride from the nearest train station at St-Michel-de-Maurienne (on the TGV line from Paris), and a free ski bus that runs every 15 minutes drops you off at the cable car 700 metres away. About 20 minutes after I left Orelle’s lower station, I was at the top of Cime Caron, which towers over Val Thorens at 3,195 metres. From here, non-skiers can reach the centre of Val Thorens by using the Cime Caron gondola and two more cable cars – handy for those who might want to check out the restaurants, sports centre, spa and cinema. Instead, soaking up the late-winter sun, I skied down into the heart of Val Thorens. From here it was easy to carry on towards Les Menuires, where another new cable car opened this season. The old lifts I last took up to Pointe de la Masse a few years ago have been replaced with a speedy gondola that transports skiers and pedestrians in search of stupendous views in just eight minutes. La Masse used to be a bit of a secret, relatively speaking, but that secret is truly out now with the construction of an enormous 360-degree viewing platform at the summit. Along with the now obligatory #lesmenuires Instagram-friendly giant letters facing the mountains, there are artistically arranged metal sculptures highlighting the peaks and glaciers you can see. I spotted Cime Caron where I had skied down earlier. But unlike Cime Caron, where there are only red and black runs, La Masse has beginner-friendly blues, a picnic area and a little fun park for kids. And its 1,000-metre descent is one of the loveliest in the resort. Méribel was just as easy to explore the following day, as I meandered through Val Thorens across to the 2,850-metre Col de la Chambre and up and down Mont Vallon. By this time the wind was turning fierce, bringing with it the red Saharan sand that was blowing across parts of Europe that week. It was surreal to see pink tinges on white snow. It was just as surreal when, at the end of the ski day when we gathered at Orelle’s little bar by the lower cable car station, I paid €3.60 for a glass of wine. Not quite Courchevel prices. The wind had calmed down when I queued up the next morning for my first attempt at a zipwire, La Tyrolienne. From Orelle’s highest point, Sommet des Trois Vallées at 3,230 metres, I was wedged into a harness, skis and poles strapped to my back, and off I went. One minute and 45 seconds of a simultaneously exhilarating and soothing whoosh across 1,300 metres to Col de Thorens. At €55 a go, it wasn’t quite in keeping with Orelle’s budget-friendly ethos, but it was an invigorating taste of the high life. Accommodation was provided by Le Hameau des Eaux d’Orelle and lift passes by Trois Vallées.

3/23/2022,"Sales of stickers calling on voters to “bin” the prime minister have surged after the Liberal heavyweight Philip Ruddock’s Hornsby Shire Council threatened residents that garbage collection services may be suspended if they weren’t removed from wheelie bins. On Wednesday Ruddock, the Hornsby mayor and NSW Liberal party president, defended council’s decision to insist upon the removal of stickers containing photos of Scott Morrison and Barnaby Joyce emblazoned with the slogans “bin him” and “chuck them out”. He insisted the decision was taken by council officers, and had nothing to do with his office as mayor or his fellow elected councillors, of which five of nine are Liberal. “The council officers took the decision in relation to the bins – which are council property – that they should not be interfered with by putting on them advertising material,” Ruddock said during one of many media interviews on Wednesday. “This was not my decision. It was made by the professional staff but if you have signage that you want to put up, put it up in your garden on a post on your property, but don’t use council property. “The bins are public property; you don’t own them; you hire them from the council to remove your waste and we ask you not to deface them with advertising material of any form.” On Wednesday, the Sydney Morning Herald reported a resident with the stickers had received a letter saying they were “not appropriate”, and warning “you risk council’s collection contractor not servicing your bins as they cannot identify council’s logo on the bin”. But the issue may be about to escalate, with dozens more stickers sold in Hornsby since the warning was made public, according to Wayne Smith, the director of the organisation that makes the stickers, Smart Voting. “They have gone off,” he said, noting surges in other parts of the country as well. “Sales have soared. People are absolutely outraged.” Other Sydney mayors criticised the move, saying that while technically the bins were owned by council, politicians needed to have thicker skins. The Labor mayor of Randwick, Dylan Parker, said he wouldn’t have an issue with stickers targeting his side of politics. “Standing over residents expressing themselves looks pretty average to me,” he said. “If people want to express their views, that’s up to them. “It’s a free country.” The Inner West mayor Darcy Byrne, also from Labor, agreed. “Our policy is to focus on getting garbage and waste collection right and to leave residents’ political views to them,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Politicians need to accept that criticism is part of political life … you don’t get to withhold services from people because they have a different political view to you.” In a statement, a spokesperson for Hornsby council said it was “not opposed to free speech in any way” and that residents were able to display signage on private property and covering parts of bins could lead to confusion. “Council takes its commitment to collect residents’ waste very seriously and wants to avoid any situation where this could be prevented,” the spokesperson said.",News/Australia news,Sales of anti-Scott Morrison bin stickers surge after Liberal council threatens rubbish services,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/23/sales-of-anti-pm-stickers-surge-after-council-threatens-rubbish-services
3/23/2022,"A Foreign Office minister has flown to the British Virgin Islands (BVI) to hold urgent discussions on how sanctions against Russian oligarchs with cash stored in the secretive islands can be implemented, amid fears. UK tax havens may provide a loophole for those trying to escape the international clampdown. Amanda Milling’s visit follows news that a succession of oligarchs appeared to have hidden their assets in trusts based in the BVI in a bid to put them beyond reach of UK sanctions. British sanctions laws apply in the overseas territories, and enforcement officers are supposed to have full access to registers of beneficial ownerships. It comes after the Guardian has published a series of stories tracking the assets held outside Russia of some of the country’s all-powerful oligarchs and officials. Milling’s four-day visit also came weeks before the report of a UK government-commissioned public inquiry into corruption in the government of the island is due to be published. The inquiry chaired by a retired appeal court judge Sir Gary Hickinbottom is expected to be critical of the management of the island’s government by its prime minister, Andrew Fahie. The island’s prime minister has claimed the inquiry has not unearthed the predicted widespread corruption, but some of the most sensitive aspects of the inquiry were conducted in private. Milling met both Fahie and representatives of the BVI financial services industry to explain that they needed to implement the new sanctions laws passed by the UK government. The BVI has promised, as it is required by British law, to impose the sanctions levied by the UK government on individual oligarchs sanctioned in the UK, but there have already been reports of oligarchs shifting large sums to the BVI in an attempt to prevent their fortunes being frozen. A Russian oligarch, Alexei Mordashov, was reported to have moved $1.3bn shares to the BVI the day he was sanctioned in the UK. The Guardian, in conjunction with other news outlets, has identified that Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov’s £82m London home and Surrey mansion were put in BVI-based trusts linked to the oligarch. An FCDO spokesperson said: “The BVI and other overseas territories already share confidential information on company beneficial ownership with UK law enforcement bodies and have agreed to introduce public registers. UK sanctions apply in all overseas territories and we will continue to support their implementation.” During her visit Milling urged the government to get on with preparations for a central publicly available register of beneficial ownership, seen by campaigners as a key weapon in fighting money laundering. UK ministers have insisted a public register must be in place by the end of 2023, but some of the overseas territories are resisting the proposal by planning to insert loopholes so that beneficial owners can continue to keep their identities secret. In 2018 the UK voted that these registers should be installed by 2020, but the Foreign Office reinterpreted the legislation to give the overseas territories an extra three years. The Cayman Islands, another British overseas territory, is further down the road since it has published a consultation paper on how the register would operate in 2023. The paper contains plans to introduce a major potential loophole into the legislation that will allow anyone to ask for their name not to be publicly available “due to the nature of activities of the associated entity, or because of their characteristics or personal attributes when associated with that entity, that will put the beneficial owner, or any person living with them, at serious risk of harm or intimidation”. Some of those seeking anonymity say they want to protect their privacy not because of wrongdoing but to reduce the risk of threats from terrorists, kidnappers or stalkers. The BVI cabinet on 19 January took its first steps to set up a publicly accessible register by 2023. Fahie told a press conference on 11 March he was fully committed to the register coming into force, but then added caveats saying he was making the case for a different strategic approach. The BVI premier said: “As such, while we continue to monitor developments on the subject of publicly accessible registers as they feature in various international fora, and while we continue to make the case for a slightly different strategic approach, we must, of course, take the appropriate steps to honour our commitment if and when called upon.” In 2018, a report by Global Witness, the transparency campaign group, said £34bn was currently invested by Russians in the UK’s OTs. The British Virgin Islands was identified as the second most popular destination for money leaving Russia, behind Cyprus. The BVI was last month on the EU grey list for lack of tax transparency.",News/World news,UK minister in BVI for urgent talks on sanctioning Russian oligarchs,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/uk-minister-in-bvi-for-urgent-talks-on-sanctioning-russian-oligarchs
3/23/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray bringing you the top stories. Almost 100,000 people trapped in the ruined city of Mariupol face starvation amid “constant” Russian bombardment, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said. More than 7,000 people escaped the city in the past 24 hours, he said. The besieged southern port city has been left a “freezing hellscape riddled with dead bodies and destroyed buildings”, Human Rights Watch says. According to 39-year-old Viktoria Totsen, who fled to Poland: “During the last five days, the planes were flying over us every five seconds and dropped bombs everywhere on residential buildings, kindergartens, art schools, everywhere.” A local official said: “It is clear that the occupiers are not interested in the city of Mariupol, they want to raze it to the ground, to reduce it to ashes of a dead land.” There have been signs of Ukrainian forces going on the offensive, retaking a town near Kyiv and launching counterattacks in the south. The Pentagon has said Russia’s forces may have been reduced by as much as 10% in the four weeks of fighting. Ukraine’s military, meanwhile, has alleged the Russian invasion forces have only three further days of fuel, food and ammunition after breakdowns in their supply lines. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, speaking on CNN, has refused to rule out that Russia might use nuclear weapons if it sees itself as facing “existential threat”. The US defence department spokesman John Kirby branded the remarks “dangerous … not the way a responsible nuclear power should act”. Russian forces “looted and destroyed” a laboratory at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials have said, with “highly active samples” falling into the invaders’ hands. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has said it is time for Russia to end its “absurd” and “unwinnable” war, as the EU prepares to set up a “trust fund” to help Ukraine repel the invasion and rebuild afterwards. “Even if Mariupol falls, Ukraine cannot be conquered city by city, street by street, house by house,” Guterres said. Russian forces have “kidnapped” 2,389 children from the Russian-controlled areas of Luhansk and Donetsk, the US embassy in Kyiv has said, citing figures by Ukraine’s foreign ministry. The embassy said: “This is not assistance. It is kidnapping.” Keep up with further developments at our live blog. ‘For me, this is right’ – Ash Barty, the world No 1, has stunned the tennis world by announcing her retirement at the age of 25. Barty delivered the bombshell news in an online interview released this morning. “I just know at the moment in my heart [that] for me as a person, this is right … I’m so grateful for everything tennis has given me – it’s given me all my dreams plus more.” Barty said she had been thinking about retiring “for a long time” and had “a gut feeling” after last year’s Wimbledon win but there was “a little part of me that wasn’t quite satisfied, wasn’t quite fulfilled”. Winning the Australian Open “feels like the perfect way, my perfect way to celebrate what an amazing journey my tennis career has been”. “I just know that I am absolutely – I am spent – I just know physically I have nothing more to give. And that to me is success. I have given absolutely everything I can to this beautiful sport of tennis.” Barty departs at the peak of her powers, as the reigning Australian Open and Wimbledon champion who has held the world No 1 position since winning the 2019 French Open. It was the Queenslander’s second coming after she took an indefinite break in 2014, while ranked outside the Top 200, because “it was too much too quickly for me as I’ve been travelling from quite a young age”, saying she wanted to experience life “as a normal teenaged girl”. Barty was the Wimbledon girls’ singles champion in 2011, aged 15. ‘Confront this challenge’ – Rishi Sunak will promise “security” to cash-strapped families today as he announces measures to tackle the cost of living crisis while committing to fixing the public finances. Sunak is predicted to use his spring update to announce a cut in fuel duty of at least 5p a litre, but hinted on Tuesday night there may be a more extensive package of support. Options include raising the threshold at which workers start paying national insurance contributions (NICs); deferring the 1.25-point NICs increase; uprating state benefits in line with the 8% inflation rate expected for April; and providing help to energy-intensive businesses. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has accused the chancellor of introducing the controversial NICs rise to give himself the scope to promise tax cuts ahead of the next general election. The statement has been turned by Russia’s war on Ukraine into the latest of a string of mini-budgets. In pre-released extracts of his speech, Sunak says: “We will confront this challenge to our values not just in the arms and resources we send to Ukraine but in strengthening our economy here at home.” The cross-party Treasury select committee has warned the invasion of Ukraine will damage the UK economy. In its report on the impact of sanctions on Vladimir Putin, the committee said Russia was heading for “economic catastrophe” but the war would have as yet unquantifiable costs to the UK.

Government by WhatsApp – Communication within government during the pandemic was often by instant messaging, such as by WhatsApp, a senior Cabinet Office official has accepted. It has emerged a series of messages were lost from Boris Johnson’s phone in April 2021 amid security precautions after it was found that the prime minister’s phone number was listed on the internet, according to Sarah Harrison, the chief operating officer at the Cabinet Office. The loss of the messages comes despite ministers being “required to make a separate record of any conversation” relevant to work. WhatsApp is only supposed to be allowed “for ephemeral chat and/or unclassified material”. A court challenge over the use of private messaging in government is being undertaken by the Good Law Project and the Citizens, a non-profit media organisation. Takes the biscuits – It was about 9pm in late November when a rare Marsican brown bear nicknamed Juan Carrito sauntered into Roccaraso, a ski resort town in Italy’s Abruzzo region, before turning into a side alley, smashing a small window of Dolci Momenti (Sweet Moments) bakery and clambering in to scoff a batch of biscuits. Juan Carrito, who was a fixture in the town, has since been tranquilised and moved away, though some residents want him back. “It was a disaster at the time, we had to throw everything away and disinfect everything,” says the bakery owner, Marina Valentini. “Now I have to deal with the crazy publicity: tourists come in and ask: ‘Are these the biscuits the bear ate’?” Two years after the first UK coronavirus lockdown, Laura Spinney reflects on what the years after the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic looked like, and what we might expect in a post-Covid era.

Jason Roy has been hit with a suspended two-match ban from international cricket and a £2,500 fine, the reasons for which are being kept out of the public domain by the England and Wales Cricket Board. An ECB statement said the limited‑overs opener had accepted a charge of bringing the game into disrepute, with the suspended element of his ban “dependent on good behaviour” over the next 12 months. Left-arm spinner Jack Leach heads into the deciding third Test against West Indies today, fresh from a gruelling workload of 94.5 overs during the drawn second Test at Kensington Oval that returned six of his 11 wickets on tour but in which both he and England were thwarted by Kraigg Brathwaite’s stickability. Two late goals saw Barcelona beat Real Madrid by three goals to two in their Women’s Champions League quarter-final first leg; while Paris Saint-Germain’s record goalscorer Marie-Antoinette Katoto showed her class yet again as she scored twice to help secure a 2-1 victory against Bayern Munich. Paul Canoville, the first black footballer to play for Chelsea, has increased the pressure on the Ricketts family by becoming the latest figure to speak out against their attempt to buy the club. Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has revealed his World Cup winner’s medal was among the items stolen during a recent burglary at his home. Rafael Nadal’s preparations for the upcoming clay-court season have hit a setback after he was diagnosed with a rib stress fracture following his straight-sets defeat against Taylor Fritz in the Indian Wells final on Sunday. Nadal will be out for four to six weeks. The government has drawn up plans to take over the funding of the UK operation of the Russian energy giant Gazprom, should the state-backed supplier collapse as customers cut supply contracts due to the invasion of Ukraine. The war continues to cause great volatility on financial markets with stocks surging in Asia overnight as investors fled a rout in government bonds. Oil was up 1.7% to $117 a barrel.

Also on the front, the continuation of the Russian asset tracker project – “Revealed: Usmanov ‘donated’ assets to family trust”. “Landmine danger in Ukraine for decades” says the i while the Times warns “Ukrainian troops are running out of weapons”. The Telegraph is more hopeful, with “Ukrainians regain key territory in fightback”. The Metro has “Sling your hook” after the floating “gin palace” of Roman Abramovich was intercepted on approach to a Turkish port by Ukrainians in a dinghy. It says sanctioned oligarchs are playing “cat and mouse” at sea to avoid their superyachts being seized. In news at home, the Mirror has a “Spring statement plea – we need your help, Rishi”. Rachel Vango, a “mum with two jobs”, is shown with children and quoted as saying “Please help us with fuel and bills and don’t put up national insurance”. The Daily Mail assures the chancellor that “You CAN spike the hike” and the Daily Express is sure he will – “Rishi: I’ll ease economic pain”.
