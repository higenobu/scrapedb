2/8/2022,"British teenager Kirsty Muir branded the standard in the women’s Freeski Big Air contest as “insane” after finishing an inspiring fifth on her Winter Olympics debut. Muir, 17, is the youngest member of the British Winter Olympics team in China, and went into the last of her three runs knowing that she needed a big score to lift herself up among the medals. In pushing for the podium, Muir attempted a trick she had not performed before and a crash left her out of the top three.  “I went for a switch misty 10 in the last jump which I’ve never tried before,” she said. “I just wanted to go for it. I’m just so happy I went and tried it.” Muir eventually scored 169.00 points behind China’s US-born Eileen Gu, who won gold on 188.25. The silver medal went to France’s Tess Ledeux, with the Swiss skier Mathilde Gremaud taking the bronze. The event, like Muir, was making its first Olympic appearance, and when asked to sum up her performance afterwards, she said: “I’m so happy right now honestly, the level was insane. I couldn’t have hoped to have skied better today and I’m so proud of all the girls.” Muir had landed a rare dub 12 trick on her opening jump. “Getting to the final,” she said, “I knew I’d be happiest if I really went for it. I’ve landed the [dub 12] trick before, but I tried it with a different grab which I’ve only landed in competition once before, and that was definitely the best I’ve ever done it.” The Aberdeen-born teenager, who previously won the silver medal in the sport at the Lausanne 2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games, had said in a social media post on Monday that qualifying in the top 12 for the finals was “a dream come true”. Muir will now go on to compete in the women’s slopestyle competition on Sunday. She told the BBC that after that, it will be back to education for her, saying “I’ve got a bit of studying to catch up for sure. I’m focused on my next event, and then it’s back to school.”",Sport/Sport,‘The level was insane’: British teen Kirsty Muir proud of fifth on Olympic debut,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/08/the-level-was-insane-british-teen-kirsty-muir-proud-of-fifth-on-winter-olympic-debut
2/8/2022,"Labour shortages, in particular of HGV drivers, have held back growth at Ocado, but the online supermarket said it had managed to keep price rises lower than the 3.8% level of grocery price inflation reported last week. It made total sales of £2.5bn last year, up 7.2% on 2020, as more people shopped online. Ocado Retail, the joint venture it runs with Marks & Spencer, contributed £2.3bn in sales, up 4.6%. Customer numbers increased by 22% to 832,000, driving a near-12% increase in orders, although this was partly offset by a 5.8% reduction in average basket size to £129.  Ocado’s pretax loss widened to nearly £177m from £52m, reflecting higher investment in its automated warehouses and the solutions division that sells its technology to other retailers. The sales growth was weaker than that of rivals such as Sainsbury’s and Ocado’s share price fell more than 11% to £12.49 in early trading on Tuesday. The company said order growth had been restricted by worker shortages in the second half, coupled with a warehouse fire caused by a robot collision in Erith in south-east London. Drops made by each van a week dropped to 177 last year from 184 in 2020. However, labour shortages are easing, and its vacancy rate has dropped from 8% in October to 3.5%. Tim Steiner, the chief executive, said: “The past year has further reinforced that demand for online grocery is here to stay.” Online sales make up 12% of the total UK grocery market, and the research firm GlobalData expects the online share to increase to 18% by 2025. As the cost of living crisis continues to worsen, with food and energy bills soaring, Steiner indicated that price rises at Ocado had been lower than the 3.8% grocery price inflation reported by the market data firm Kantar last week. The company uses vast warehouses, with robots crisscrossing a giant chessboard-style grid layout to sort its orders. Ocado opened five new big warehouses globally last year for itself and partners including the US retailer Kroger, including its first two in the US, and has 13 that are operating, with a further six to open this year. After the opening of a Zoom micro-warehouse in Acton in west London, Ocado Retail expects to open a second Zoom site in Canning Town by the summer, followed by three others across the UK in the coming 18 months. It is competing with rapid delivery startups including Getir and Gorillas. Late last month Ocado’s shares enjoyed a bump after it unveiled robots that are 80% lighter than the previous ones, along with lighter warehouse grids for them to run on. Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Next year’s profits are expected to be lower than the market was hoping. The trouble is, Ocado’s impressive robotic grid systems and software are a fundamentally attractive product for retailers looking to boost their online footprints, but Ocado has been unable to scale as quickly as would have been ideal.”",News/Business,Ocado hit by labour shortages but insists it is holding down prices,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/ocado-labour-shortages-prices-growth-inflation
2/8/2022,"Good morning. After five hours of negotiations, Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin did not appear to reach a breakthrough in marathon talks at the Kremlin on Monday evening aimed at fending off a Russian attack on Ukraine.  Macron is due to travel to Kyiv on Tuesday, where he will hold talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He said he plans to brief Putin on the results of the discussions in a phone call. “Right now the tension is increasing and the risk of destabilisation is increasing,” Macron said, according to a simultaneous translation of his remarks after the talks. “Neither Russia, nor the Europeans want chaos or instability, when nations have already suffered from the [coronavirus] epidemic. So we need to agree on concrete measures.” Is Russia still moving troops to the Ukraine border? It certainly looks like it. A recent trip by the Guardian to the Voronezh and Kursk regions in Russia found a hive of barely hidden military activity as Russian troops continued to position themselves for a potential assault on Ukraine. What have Nord Stream 2 and gas got to do with the Ukraine standoff? Gas is not just a source of energy, sometimes it is a political weapon. As western countries weigh possible sanctions against Russia for an invasion of Ukraine, the future of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline hangs in the balance. Thousands of demonstrators have successfully occupied Canada’s capital for days, and say they plan on staying as long as it takes to thwart the country’s vaccine requirements. The brazen occupation of Ottawa is the result of unprecedented coordination between various anti-vaccine and anti-government organizations and activists, and has been seized on by similar groups around the world. It may herald the revenge of the anti-vaxxers. The so-called “freedom convoy” – which departed for Ottawa on 23 January – was the brainchild of James Bauder, an admitted conspiracy theorist who has endorsed the QAnon movement and called Covid-19 “the biggest political scam in history”. Bauder’s group, Canada Unity, contends that vaccine mandates and passports are illegal under Canada’s constitution, the Nuremberg Code and a host of other international conventions. Are neo-Nazis and QAnon really involved? Since protesters have arrived in Ottawa, the extreme elements of the protest have been visible: neo-Nazi and Confederate flags were seen flying, QAnon logos were emblazoned on trucks. Alabama does not have to redraw its congressional map for the 2022 elections, the US supreme court ruled on Monday, a win for Republicans that will leave in place a plan that has been described as a textbook example of discrimination against Black voters in the US. The court ruling boosts the party’s chances to hold six of the state’s seven seats in the House of Representatives. The court’s action, by five votes against four, means the upcoming elections will be conducted under a map drawn by Alabama’s Republican-controlled legislature that contains one majority-Black district, represented by a Black Democrat, in a state in which more than a quarter of the population is Black. The chief justice, John Roberts, joined with the court’s three liberal justices in dissenting from the ruling. A three-judge lower court, including two judges appointed by Donald Trump, had ruled that the state had likely violated the federal Voting Rights Act by diluting the political power of Black voters by not creating a second district in which they made up a majority, or close to it. What did the ruling say? Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito, part of the conservative majority, said a lower court acted too close to the 2022 election cycle. So does this mean the state may still have violated the Voting Rights Act? Kavanaugh said he had not reached a conclusion on the larger question in the case but cited a legal principle saying that courts should not change election rules close to an election. With his second executive action, Virginia’s new governor, Glenn Youngkin, made masks in schools optional, causing uproar among educators and parents. A Virginia judge has blocked Youngkin’s order, allowing school districts to continue to enforce mask mandates in schools but there is still turmoil. An employee at a Home Depot in Arizona has scammed the company out of hundreds of thousands of dollars since 2018, by swapping cash from registers with fake $100 bills, according to a criminal complaint. Adrian Jean Pineda allegedly siphoned $387,500 over four years. Germany has been left fuming after a night of ski jumping mayhem at the Winter Olympics. A series of disqualifications for the favourites meant the world champions failed to make the final. “This is a parody, but I am not laughing,” Germany’s head of Nordic events, Horst Hüttel, said. Chimpanzees have invented a creative method for treating injuries: catching insects and applying them directly to the open wound. Scientists observed this behaviour in chimpanzees in Gabon, noticing that the apes not only use insects to treat their own wounds, but also those of their peers. BP’s annual profits reached an eight-year high of $12.8bn in 2021 as it benefited from a surge in energy prices, prompting renewed calls in the UK for a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies to relieve the financial pressure on households facing a sharp rise in bills. Natural gas and electricity prices have soared since last summer because of tight gas supplies and rising demand as economies bounced back from the pandemic, and the standoff between Russia and Ukraine pushed gas prices higher. After years of playing insecure braggarts, the Will Arnett is taking on a new challenge – as star of the improvised celebrity cop show Murderville. The actor was one of the breakout stars of Arrested Development, going from a complete unknown to being cast in movie comedies such as Blades of Glory and Hot Rod, playing characters not a million miles from Gob. “I like characters who are really cocky and really dumb. That always seems to be a really great cocktail for me,” he says. He talks to Hadley Freeman about his “weird” period, his split with Amy Poehler, and having a baby in his 50s. PFAS are a family of thousands of human-made substances – nicknamed “forever chemicals” because they do not break down in the environment – that have been widely used since the 1940s in a huge range of everyday consumer products and industrial processes. The devastating impacts of PFOA was first exposed by US lawyer Rob Bilott who has been fighting for decades on behalf of people exposed to the chemicals. But what risk do they actually pose? A tourist from Arizona won $229,000 on a Las Vegas slot machine but walked away unaware of his windfall, due to an error in the machine. It took nearly three weeks for gaming board agents to track him down and enrich him. On 8 January, Robert Taylor hit a jackpot on a slot machine at the Treasure Island Hotel & Casino on the Vegas strip. But the “slot machine experienced a malfunction that prevented Mr Taylor and casino personnel from realizing that a progressive jackpot had been won”, the Nevada Gaming Control Board said.

2/8/2022,"“If you take the door off the hinges, you can fit a bed in here,” a Brooklyn broker told me on a weekend tour of a one-bedroom apartment. I’d gain space because the door wouldn’t have to swing, and the landlord would let me store it in the basement – but I’d still have to crawl over the bed to get anything from the closet. The bedroom window perfectly framed the jail on Atlantic Avenue and the apartment’s tub looked like it was last used to mix cement. No, there were no plans to reglaze it, the broker told me. “This place will be rented by Monday,” he said. So glib. So right.  I actually considered renting this place. It was October 2021 and the city’s rental inventory had dropped by 52.4%, the lowest in 10 years. The pandemic deals my friends were eating up at the beginning of 2021 – when Brooklyn’s median rent fell by 10% and a third of apartments came with at least one month free rent – were over. It felt like everyone was competing for the same prizes, but only half as many were available. Hopeful home buyers who left New York only to find themselves priced out of a nationwide housing boom returned seeking rentals. So did everyone else who left during the worst of the pandemic, and we all needed a one-bedroom immediately. The dramatic ebb and flow led to Manhattan being the most expensive city in the country to rent in as of January, and every other borough is also experiencing rapidly rising rents. Real estate experts don’t see a break coming any time soon. Our new seven-piece Guardian US series, The Rent Is Too Damn High, looks at how the pandemic further strained one of the country’s toughest rental markets. We talk to striking low-income renters on edge now that the eviction moratorium has been lifted. We ask a broker to explain the tricks they pull on us. We investigate why co-ops, which make up 74% of Manhattan’s apartment stock, are able to operate with such power and impunity. They have no legal obligation to explain a rejection – though any longtime New Yorker would, and did, shrug and tell me: “It’s because you’re Black” – as I found out in November after a grueling application process only to be denied. Why do we stay here? Why’d we all come back? Is it the hope that one day we might win the housing lottery, or luck into a rent-stabilized dream in the East Village? (We will meet some of those lucky ones later in the week.) Or knowing bad rental luck can’t last for ever? After five months of searching, a broker I met back in November sent me an unlisted apartment, one of the best I’ve ever toured. I signed the lease last week. If you’ve also recently searched for an apartment – in New York or elsewhere – tell us about your experience.

2/8/2022,"“Iwould’ve never thought that this moment would be happening right now,” Dr Dre said in an October interview heralding his headlining slot in this year’s Super Bowl halftime show. “Everybody’s gonna leave here happy and excited about what we’re about to do.” On paper the 55-year-old Dre (real name: Andre Romelle Young) seems a perfect fit for this showcase – not just a famous Angeleno of the City of Compton but arguably the most influential maker of modern Black music besides Quincy Jones and Kanye West.  In addition to the Dre and NWA rap catalogues, the Super Bowl halftime show – the world’s most watched musical performance – will include collaborators Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Kendrick Lamar, plus hip-hop soul queen Mary J Blige. Midway through next Sunday’s title clash between the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams, Dre and friends will play to a global audience in the hundreds of millions for 12 precious minutes. The F Gary Gray directed trailer, titled The Call, features Dre organizing his team like chess pieces as Still Dre and Mary J’s Family Affair and other Dre-produced hits play in the background. The slick production harks to the naughties era of million-dollar music video budgets. It’s an audacious return to the spotlight for a man who once ruled the radio, stage and screen as a solo rap artist – and who is barely a year removed from suffering a brain aneurysm. But in the age of #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter, frankly, the gangster rapper turned super producer is a tone deaf choice for a league grappling with raging gender and race crises. This year’s music lineup, with its cumulative 43 Grammys, puts most music festivals to shame and is already being feted as the best ever Super Bowl halftime bill. But apart from the conservative pundit Jason Whitlock (who upbraided the Dr Dre Super Bowl halftime as an exhibition of “lyrical pornography”) and Howard University Africana studies professor Greg Carr (who dismissed it as a “21st century minstrel show”), it wouldn’t be a stretch to say that everyone else is looking forward to this show. Who couldn’t be? The trailer, which immediately went viral, has more than 12m YouTube views. At the very least it marks an emphatic turnabout from five years ago, when Rihanna, Cardi B, Adele and other high-profile artists reportedly rejected opportunities to perform at the Super Bowl halftime in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, the mega-talented quarterback who knelt during pre-game performances of the national anthem to bring awareness of anti-Black racism. He touched off an activism movement in sports that contributed to his apparent blackballing, a contention that became the basis of his 2018 collusion lawsuit against the league. This led to Super Bowl halftime bills featuring Justin Timberlake in 2018 and Maroon 5 in 2019. In an attempt to win back the big-name artists and disgruntled fans, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell joined forces with Jay-Z, a prominent Kaepernick advocate and adviser who was among the most prominent artists to boycott the Super Bowl halftime show. The idea was that Jay-Z would provide the NFL’s aggrieved Black worker class a platform where they freely speak out about pressing issues while negotiating with the NFL’s billionaire owners behind the scenes to engineer Kaepernick’s return. But instead of a Kaepernick sequel or better representation within the sport’s decision-making ranks, the Jay-Z-Goodell alliance yielded hashtags on the field and other performative gestures, including the playing of Lift Every Voice – aka the Black national anthem. Months after Kaepernick settled with the league in 2019, Goodell and Jay-Z went public with their relationship, which gave the hip-hop mogul’s Roc Nation entertainment company significant power to choose the acts for the NFL’s signature events. But Jay-Z, who arguably sold his friend out for a content deal, has yet to say anything in defense of a halftime show lineup that celebrates a league whose racial woes appear to be worse than ever. Just last week Brian Flores, a bright Afro-Latino coach who was fired after three overachieving seasons with the Miami Dolphins, filed a class action suit against the NFL, his former employer and two other teams he interviewed with in the past, branding the sport as systemically racist. And with only Pittsburgh Steelers longtime head man Mike Tomlin remaining as the NFL’s only Black head coach, the Flores lawsuit has reignited the debate about the efficacy of the Rooney Rule, an exemplary league policy that requires teams to interview ethnic-minority candidates for head coaching and executive football operations vacancies. For the past two decades team owners have gotten around this by bringing in Rooney Rule candidates for token interviews only to wind up hiring the white guy they wanted all along. Before that bombshell, in October the NFL was rocked by the release of eight years of emails from the Las Vegas Raiders Jon Gruden, the league’s highest-profile coach; his misogynistic, racist and homophobic correspondence, which was unearthed in a larger inquiry into the Washington Football Team’s frat house-like workplace culture, ultimately cost Gruden his $10m a year job. While the NFL was attending to that crisis, it was seeking to put an even bigger one to bed, agreeing to a $1bn settlement with former players after being outed for using the practice of “race norming” – which, among other things, assumed Black people to be cognitively inferior – in determining payouts for concussions claims. But this, too, became headline news and left the league with another black eye. “Jay-Z is one of the main reasons we’re sitting here right now,” Dre said in October, flanked by Snoop Dogg – an early collaborator and mentee. “See that’s hip-hop, Dre,” Snoop said. “See how hip-hop has been implemented at a high executive level to where the NFL trusts him? He’s a part of our culture; we’re a part of his culture. So it’s a beautiful thing to where the NFL is catching up.” Dr Dre has yet to really answer for his own fraught history with women. In 1991 Dre assaulted television host Dee Barnes after an episode taping, “slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall near the stairway,” according to Barnes’ $22.7m lawsuit. (After pleading no contest, he was fined $2,500 and given a community service sentence that included a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement.) In 2015, the singer Michel’le, the mother of one of Dre’s children, accused him of committing domestic violence against her throughout their entire time as a couple. In a 2016 book Lisa Johnson, the mother of three Dre kids, alleged Dre “hit me in the mouth and bust my lip”. (She never filed criminal allegations against him, but was granted a restraining order.) In 1990 label-mate Tairrie B claimed Dre punched her twice at the Grammys for releasing a song slagging him and his NWA bandmates, an altercation that the police allegedly broke up. She further claims that she was paid to drop the charges against Dre because her album wouldn’t come out if she moved forward. In December Dre finalised a $100m divorce settlement with Nicole Young, his wife of 24 years. And during a contentious 18 months of back-and-forth exchanges, she alleged the music tycoon held a gun to her head, punched her in the face and slammed her against a wall, lifting her off her feet by her neck. While Dre refuted those claims, he did somewhat address the other allegations before the 2015 release of his third album Compton, apologising to “the women I’ve hurt”. “We have 11 or 12 minutes to go out and do something spectacular,” Dre said in October. “We have to figure out, creatively, how we’re just gonna, like, blow people’s minds.” At this point, the lineup’s too big to fail. The show is this weekend, and the league’s partners have so much at stake already – not least Dre and Jay-Z, the pen behind Still Dre. The Dr himself is said to have invested millions in the show. Like the league’s efforts to address its race and gender problems, this too appears to be a no-win proposition. Most disappointing: it’s a moment we all should have expected.",Sport/Sport,Will Dr Dre’s halftime Super Bowl show move the NFL beyond its race crisis?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/08/super-bowl-halftime-show-dr-dre-nfl-race-crisis

2/8/2022,"The influential rightwing lobby group the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) is driving a surge in new state laws to block boycotts of the oil industry. The group’s strategy, which aims to protect large oil firms and other conservative-friendly industries, is modelled on legislation to punish divestment from Israel. Since the beginning of the year, state legislatures in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Indiana have introduced a version of a law drafted by Alec, called the Energy Discrimination Elimination Act, to shield big oil from share selloffs and other measures intended to protest the fossil fuel industry’s role in the climate crisis. A dozen other states have publicly supported the intent of the legislation.  Texas has already begun compiling a list of companies to target for refusing to do business with the oil industry after the state passed a version of the law last year. Top of the list is the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock. The push to blacklist firms that boycott the oil industry follows a meeting in December between politicians and Alec, a corporate-funded organisation that writes legislation for Republican-controlled states to adopt and drive conservative causes. At that meeting in San Diego, members of Alec’s energy taskforce voted to promote the model legislation requiring banks and financial companies to sign a pledge to not boycott petroleum companies in order to obtain state contracts. The wording closely resembles that of laws drafted by Alec and adopted in more than 30 states to block support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel’s oppression of the Palestinians. Similar laws are also being promoted to protect the gun industry from boycotts. The legislation written by Alec, which has a history of extreme denial of the climate crisis, claims that “American and European fossil energy producers … are among the most socially and environmentally responsible companies in the world”. It laments that “corporations are boycotting fossil energy companies by refusing to provide them with products or services”, and says that share selloffs by financial funds hurt investors. “Banks are increasingly denying financing to creditworthy fossil energy companies solely for the purpose of decarbonizing their lending portfolios and marketing their environmental credentials,” the draft legislation says. “This model bill proposes a strategy in which states use their collective economic purchasing power to counter the rise of politically motivated and discriminatory investing practices.” The drive to pass the legislation follows the refusal of major financial firms to fund new oil and gas drilling in the Arctic. Banks and other financial institutions are also under pressure from environmental groups and customers to divest from fossil fuel companies. JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Goldman Sachs are among those firms to publicly commit to supporting the transition away from oil. As with anti-BDS laws, any business with more than 10 employees would have to certify that it is not boycotting fossil fuel companies in order to do business with a state government. State funds, such as pensions, will usually be obliged to sell investments in corporations that refuse loans to the oil industry. Alec’s push comes after the Texas legislature passed a version of the law in June 2021. That legislation was backed by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, an active member of Alec that is funded in part by Koch Industries, which accused Wall Street firms of “colluding in a coordinated attack against Texas and our way of life” by denying capital to oil firms. TPPF, which has several members also working inside Alec and maintains close ties to Senator Ted Cruz and rightwing former Texas governor Rick Perry, then pushed for the law to be adopted by other states. Jason Isaac, a former Texas state legislator who now heads TPPF’s initiative to defend the oil industry, sent a memo to participants in the Alec meeting in San Diego in which he criticised “woke” banks and other financial institutions he accused of “colluding to deny lending and investment in fossil fuel companies”. “The following model policy is based on anti-BDS legislation supported by ALEC regarding Israel and was recently passed in Texas to include discrimination against fossil fuels. Voting for this model policy, and encouraging more state legislatures to adopt it, will send a strong message that the states will fight back against woke capitalism,” the memo said, which was obtained by Alex Kotch of the Center for Media and Democracy. In January, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick asked the state comptroller to put BlackRock, which manages an estimated $10tn worth of assets, at the top of its list of blacklisted companies because he said its pledge to work toward decarbonising the energy sector “will destroy the oil and gas industry and destabilize the economy worldwide”. Patrick accused BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink and his executives of making reassuring statements in private by saying the company “was committed to Texas and Texas’s vast energy footprint” but taking a different position in public by pledging to pressure energy firms to work toward net zero. “Therefore, BlackRock is boycotting energy companies by basing investment decisions on whether a company pledges to meet BlackRock’s ‘net zero’ goals,” Patrick wrote. BlackRock, which stands to lose about $20bn in Texas public sector pension funds, in fact remains a significant shareholder in oil and gas companies through index funds. “BlackRock does not boycott energy companies,” it said in a statement to the Guardian. “We do not pursue divestment from oil and gas companies as a policy. We expect to continue to be invested in these companies and will work with them as they drive the energy transition to maximize long-term value for our clients. Our primary concern with the law is the potential negative consequences it could have on current and future Texas pensioners.” The anti-BDS legislation has faced legal challenges after residents of Dickinson, Texas, were required to sign pledges not to boycott Israel in order to receive hurricane damage relief and a teacher in Kansas was told she had to do the same to keep her job. Several states were forced to amend anti-BDS laws to restrict it to larger companies after courts ruled that requiring individuals to sign pledges not to boycott Israel intruded on free speech rights.",News/Environment,Rightwing lobby group Alec driving laws to blacklist companies that boycott the oil industry,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/08/rightwing-lobby-alec-blacklist-companies-boycott-oil-industry
2/8/2022,"At the end of last summer, Claire and her partner, Alan, found the perfect New York apartment. “At the time we naively thought the mortgage process would be the most difficult part,” recalled Claire. “Little did we know.” The first-time buyers were suddenly confronting the reality of trying to purchase an apartment in a market-rate co-op building.  They worked on their application for a month. “We submitted every piece of financial paperwork you can possibly imagine,” said Claire. “Bank statements, W2s, tax returns, gift letters explaining any sums of money we had received from third parties. No stone was left unturned in terms of our financial history.” They wrote a letter stating why they wanted to live in the building and provided 12 other letters including personal and professional references. A month later, they got a response. “I remember I looked at my phone,” she recalled, “and all the blood drained out of my brain.” Alan had texted to say they’d been rejected by the co-op board. Their broker couldn’t explain why – he didn’t know. “It could have been based on the fact that my partner is Asian American, or it could have been that they wanted someone with more money, someone who would pay all cash,” Claire said. “The point is, we have no idea.” Co-op boards – a small group of building shareholders entrusted with overseeing everything from the financial health of a building to maintenance – are seen as directors of a private corporation, which is what co-ops are, so they aren’t legally required to disclose their reasons for denying applicants. Co-ops are a significant part of New York City housing, making up about 74% of Manhattan’s apartment stock. They’ve been around for more than 100 years, a 20th-century model for an urban “planned community”. They resemble country clubs and private social clubs, assuring shareholders – those who have bought units in the building – that they’ll be surrounded by others who look and earn money like they do. The upside for anyone who’s accepted is the guarantee of community, but the incalculable downside is exclusion for countless others – the secrecy allows for discrimination with impunity. The model hasn’t adapted to modern transparency standards and is little inclined toward doing so, given the political power that comes with such economic might. It’s a danger for buyers and renters who don’t fit the mold of any given building, and the broader effect is fewer housing options in a city that’s already short on affordability. Despite their significant footprint in New York real estate, little data exists on co-ops because of their lack of transparency. In 2006, the then New York governor, George Pataki, signed a law requiring that co-op sales be publicly recorded – so it is possible to track, say, the rise in the median asking price for a Manhattan co-op from $625,000 in June 2010 to $850,000 in November of last year. But about the people who live in the buildings – and those who are kept out, both renters and buyers – we know very little. Setha Low, a professor of anthropology and the director of the public space research group at the City University of New York (Cuny), has spent 12 years studying co-ops. She has collected and is still analyzing data on 50 buildings in New York. Individuals with sound finances who were turned away by boards told Low that subtle hostilities or the feeling that the board was going through the motions during the application process often left them feeling like they were rejected because of some aspect of their identity. “There’s no question,” she said, “there’s all kinds of discrimination going on. It works in a variety of ways. Some buildings don’t want high-profile people, sometimes it’s about race or ability, a lot of buildings won’t consider a single mother. It’s unbelievable that we still live this way.” The Fair Housing Act of 1968 creates a federal prohibition on housing discrimination, but without disclosure from co-op boards it’s not practically possible to enforce the law. A 2010 lawsuit brought against a co-op in the Bronx (with only 1% of its 1,100 units owned by African Americans) went on for three years and resulted in a modest settlement that included a revised application process and required fair housing training for board members. But that case is an outlier. Testing, or getting actors to apply for housing, is often used to screen for housing discrimination but it’s far more complicated to test co-ops. As Claire and Alan learned, the process can take months and involves extensive financial reporting. “The co-op penetrates all the way through to your very personhood,” said Low, “because you are all collectively part of something.” This idea of “collectively being a part of something” through the co-op model began flourishing in New York during the 1910s and 20s, just as the country instituted some of its first and most sweeping limitations on immigration, and as Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, less that 25 miles from the city, became an important center for the country’s new and thriving eugenics movement. In those early days, developers pushing the co-op model assured prospective buyers that they’d not only be surrounded by financially stable neighbors but also acceptable neighbors, whatever that might mean to any group of people – it became the model for socially engineering who has access to a building. Matthew Gordon Lasner, who wrote extensively about co-ops in his 2012 book High Life: Condo Living in the Suburban Century, said: “In Europe, where apartment-dwelling was extremely common, there was no prevailing social anxiety about who your neighbors might be. In the US, there has always been a tremendous amount of anxiety about this. So developers figured out how to exploit that anxiety, introducing and encouraging screening and exclusion as a way to add value to this form of real estate.” This market-driven co-op model was an American creation. Earlier European co-ops had a non-profit model, which placed caps on things like sale prices and shareholder income, in order to foster inclusion. The market-driven model, by contrast, is for profit and it isn’t afraid to discriminate in order to protect those profits. In his book, Lasner highlights one co-op developer who bragged to the Chicago Tribune in 1924 that his building was going to “be about as hard for the first five [buyers] to prove their right to residence as it would be for a Chinaman to get into the KKK. Ability to pay the purchase money will be only a minor consideration in the searching scrutiny into the applicant’s claims to entrance.” While such overtly inflammatory language may not be acceptable today, the same basic idea of the screening process, shrouded in secrecy, remains in place. This archaic system not only affects those seeking to buy; it also makes co-ops even less accessible to renters. Though most co-ops maintain a certain percentage of apartments as rental units, shareholders are preferred over renters because they are viewed as more reliable individuals who bring more financial stability to the building. The sense is that a building is less transient with shareholders because they’re generally more inclined to stay in the building longer while their investment grows. More rental units disappear every year as buildings convert to co-ops. Landlords empty out a building of renters, form a corporation, and start advertising to potential shareholders. The financial incentives for this type of conversion go beyond the initial windfall: it saves the landlord from shouldering long-term maintenance costs (shareholders pay monthly maintenance fees) and co-ops enjoy several favorable tax valuations and exemptions. In New York City, these conversions started in 1941 and over the last 80 years, 3,278 rental buildings have become co-ops, according to the real estate data company Property Shark. During the 1980s, hundreds of buildings were converted every year. In 1985 alone, 48,176 apartments were taken off the rental market and sold to shareholders, according to a report from Cuny’s Baruch College. Steven Goldschmidt has served on his Upper West Side co-op board for the past 17 years. His building went co-op in 2004, leaving only 15% of apartments available for renters. Goldschmidt, who works as senior vice-president and director of sales at Warburg Realty, said co-ops would “tolerate” renters to a certain point, but the dynamic between shareholders and renters was often fraught. Co-ops don’t extend many rights to renters; they are often left off email lists and barred from shareholder meetings. It’s ownership that grants these rights, in the eyes of the co-op. Natalia Nakaszawa experienced this treatment when she moved into a co-op in Queens’ Jackson Heights neighborhood as a renter with her husband, Patrick, in 2014. They assembled the lengthy application package and sat for an in-person interview with the board – a common part of the screening process. “We ended up sleeping on the floor of our new apartment for about 15 days,” said Nakaszawa. While they had been approved as tenants, the board had not yet approved their move-in date, so they weren’t allowed to bring furniture into the building. “It felt like they had all the cards.” Surrounded by boxes in the hallway after they got permission to bring in their belongings, they were approached by a neighbor who questioned whether they had, in fact, received board approval. That kind of surveillance persisted. While she said she could not be sure what was driving the suspicion, Nakaszawa, who is Asian Latina, did take note that “in general, the makeup of the board was, unsurprisingly, white and older”. A year after moving in, she gave birth to her son and soon after, shareholders in her building took a vote on whether to ban children from the roof deck, with 25% voting in favor. A couple of years later, a babysitter called Nakaszawa to explain that a neighbor was threatening to call the police because her son was crying. Experiences like this became routine. “One neighbor,” she said, “told us she hoped our child would die.” Eventually they decided to move. “It became so toxic,” she said. “Every person I knew who had a child ended up moving out. It’s very hard to live peacefully with this level of power play. You’re never safe to just live your life.” Addranna Montgomery is an attorney with the housing rights staff at TakeRoot Justice, a legal advocacy organization in New York. She understands the systemic problems that define the market-driven co-op model; as a lifelong New Yorker preparing for a move, she might soon have to apply to live in one but is trepidatious about doing so as a single Black woman. Montgomery has known others, particularly Black women, who have experienced trouble with the screening process. “It’s a known thing that getting into a co-op in some of these neighborhoods, particularly as a Black, single woman, is not going to be an easy feat,” she said. “There’s no reporting. You just talk about it to your friends and your community and it becomes known fact. The process is replete with racism – let’s just be frank.” Over the years, her frustration with New York City housing – the cost, the lack of access – has fueled a stronger sense of determination. “At times,” she said, “I’ve felt locked out of my hometown. And I say to myself, ‘I’ll be damned if that’s going to happen.’” She lives in a rent-stabilized apartment but is ready to become a homeowner in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Park Slope. From an early age, she was in the neighborhood most weekends for choir practice or visits to the Brooklyn Public Library. She remembers enjoying the view of Prospect Park across the street from the library steps. “I love the park. I want to be close to it. That’s always been a dream of mine.” In some ways she’s already moved into the neighborhood, having joined the Park Slope food co-op and taking yoga classes in the area; she spends weekends walking the tree-lined streets off of Seventh and Eighth Avenues. She often walks past buildings she’s tracking for available units. Sometimes she contemplates approaching a doorman or security guard to chat and get a feel for the place, for whether the building might be receptive to her as an applicant. Montgomery said that often when she peers into lobbies, seeing the people going in and coming out, she thinks: “I don’t know anyone in there.” As Lasner points out in his book, the exclusionary aspects of the market-driven co-op structure don’t directly affect the shareholders. “Once you’re in and through with the headache, well, people enjoy power,” he said. “I feel like a lot of shareholders participating in this process of exclusion don’t really realize what they’re doing – that they’re part of a larger, problematic system.” New York is the last city in America where the co-op model continues to thrive. While its endurance might be worrying, it is not surprising. “At this point, there’s just too much skin in the game – a lot of capital and political power. It’s not going to disappear any time soon,” Goldschmidt said. Within the real estate industry, there is some movement for more disclosure, including revealing reasons for rejecting applicants, which Goldschmidt supports. “I wouldn’t be thinking about this if it wasn’t for the terrible abuse by co-op boards, rejecting buyers for absolutely no sane reason,” he said. Goldschmidt said he loved being on his board because it afforded him the opportunity to be directly involved in his most immediate community. But he also acknowledged how dysfunctional the governing bodies can become. “It’s a very inbred world,” he said. In January of 2021, the New York state senator Brian Kavanagh introduced S2874, which would require New York City co-ops to operate within a “uniform application process” with timelines, guidelines for clear communication throughout the process, and written statements of approval or denial provided to the applicant and to a state agency for discrimination monitoring. There would still be room for dishonesty in the disclosures, but requiring them would be a first step in curbing some of the more egregious abuses of the screening process. “There were a lot of issues we saw consistently with co-ops and that’s what we’ve targeted in the bill,” said Britny McKenzie, who, as a policy coordinator at the Fair Housing Justice Center, worked closely with Kavanagh’s office on the bill’s language. “We think it’s vital.” McKenzie notes that similar bills have recently passed in Westchester and Suffolk counties, just outside New York City. Kavanagh is trying to garner more support for his bill with help from McKenzie and other advocates. Claire and Alan asked to use only their first names because they were still applying to other co-ops. They recently began the application process again, in another building. No naivety this time, and maybe a little less hope. Particularly when they came to a question in the new application that asked if they had ever been rejected by a co-op board. “Not only do we need to disclose that this happened,” Claire said, “but we are also being asked to give an explanation.” An explanation that – as anyone familiar with a co-op would know – Claire does not have. “It feels like an unjustified mark on us,” she said. “We feel like we’ve been tarnished without any recourse for defending ourselves. Boards act with total impunity.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘All kinds of discrimination’: inside the secretive world of New York housing co-ops,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/08/new-york-housing-co-ops-apartments-discrimination
2/8/2022,"Getting an hour or so more sleep each night can help people to cut calories, according a small clinical trial in overweight adults. Researchers in the US found that people who typically slept for less than 6.5 hours a night shed an average of 270 calories from their daily intake when they got an extra 1.2 hours of sleep.  Sustained over three years, the reduction in calories could lead people to lose about 12kg (26lbs) without changing their diet during the day, the scientists believe. Some participants in the study consumed 500 fewer calories a day after improving their sleep. The study was not designed to look at weight loss, but researchers noticed the fall in calories within two weeks of patients changing their sleep patterns. “If healthy sleep habits are maintained over longer duration, this would lead to clinically important weight loss over time,” said Dr Esra Tasali, of the University of Chicago’s sleep centre. “Many people are working hard to find ways to decrease their caloric intake to lose weight – well, just by sleeping more, you may be able to reduce it substantially.” The trial studied 80 adults aged 21 to 40 with a body mass index between 25 and 29.9, meaning they were overweight. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive personalised sleep hygiene counselling aimed at extending the amount of time they slept each night. The study did not ask the volunteers to restrict their diets or change their exercise routines. All slept in their own beds and used wearable devices to track their sleep duration. Previous studies have shown that getting too little sleep can lead people to put on weight by increasing their food intake. The latest trial, published in Jama Internal Medicine, suggests the effects may be reversed by helping people to sleep for longer. “Most other studies on this topic in labs are short-lived, for a couple of days, and food intake is measured by how much participants consume from an offered diet,” said Tasali. “In our study we only manipulated sleep and had the participants eat whatever they wanted, with no food logging or anything else to track their nutrition by themselves.” One of the most surprising findings from the study is that a single sleep counselling session could change people’s bedtime habits enough to improve the amount of sleep they got. “We simply coached each individual on good sleep hygiene, and discussed their own personal sleep environments, providing tailored advice on changes they could make to improve their sleep duration,” Tasali said.",News/Science,Sleeping longer can help cut calorie intake – study,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/08/sleeping-longer-can-help-cut-calorie-intake-study
2/8/2022,"Long-term paracetamol use could increase the risk of heart disease and strokes in people with high blood pressure, a study suggests. Patients who have a long-term prescription for the painkiller, usually used for the treatment of chronic pain, should opt for the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time, researchers say.  The University of Edinburgh study, published in the scientific journal Circulation, is the first large randomised clinical trial to address the issue and complements earlier work in observational studies. Paracetamol has often assumed to be a safer alternative to another class of painkillers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, which have long been known to increase blood pressure and the risk of heart disease. In the study, 110 patients with a history of high blood pressure were prescribed 1g of paracetamol four times a day – a routinely prescribed dose in patients with chronic pain – or a matched placebo for two weeks. All patients received both treatments, with the order randomised and blinded. Those prescribed paracetamol had a significant increase in their blood pressure, compared with those taking the placebo. This rise was similar to that seen with NSAIDs, and might be expected to increase the risk of heart disease or stroke by about 20%, experts say. The lead investigator, Dr Iain MacIntyre, a consultant in clinical pharmacology and nephrology at NHS Lothian, said: “This is not about short-term use of paracetamol for headaches or fever, which is, of course, fine – but it does indicate a newly discovered risk for people who take it regularly over the longer term, usually for chronic pain.” Prof James Dear, personal chair of clinical pharmacology at Edinburgh, added: “This study clearly shows that paracetamol – the world’s most used drug – increases blood pressure, one of the most important risk factors for heart attacks and strokes. Doctors and patients together should consider the risks versus the benefits of long-term paracetamol prescription, especially in patients at risk of cardiovascular disease.” The study found that after people stopped taking the drug, their blood pressure returned to what it was at the start of the study. Researchers said they did not have accurate numbers of the people in the UK who are on paracetamol long-term and have high blood pressure. But it is estimated that one in three adults in the UK have high blood pressure, increasing with age, while one in 10 people in Scotland – where the research was conducted – take paracetamol regularly. There were limitations to the study. It involved only 110 people, it did not look at patients with chronic pain, and the results do not reveal anything specific about what might happen in people who did not have high blood pressure to begin with. Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, the medical director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the study, said the research showed “how quickly regular use of paracetamol can increase blood pressure in people with hypertension who are already at increased risk of heart attacks and strokes”. However, he also stressed: “If you take paracetamol occasionally to manage an isolated headache or very short bouts of pain, these research findings should not cause unnecessary concern.”",News/Science,Long-term paracetamol use may be a risk for people with high blood pressure,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/08/long-term-paracetamol-use-may-be-a-risk-for-people-with-high-blood-pressure
2/8/2022,"China’s Olympic committee has pledged to increase production of merchandise after unexpected demand from people looking for a way to get involved in the Games led to shortages of the local mascot. The official mascot, a panda named Bing Dwen Dwen wearing a transparent snow suit, has featured across the Games events and promotions. A large dancing Bing Dwen Dwen appeared in the opening ceremony, while plush toys have been held aloft by athletes on the podium.  Its popularity has led to shortages of merchandise across retail outlets, exacerbated by factory shutdowns across the lunar new year holiday period, according to officials and state media, which have reported hours-long queues of people outside shops. On Monday, the Beijing Olympic Committee said it was working with factories to increase supply. At one flagship store, the Tmall Olympic, 50,000 mascots had been sold already, according to local media, while an online store sold out within 15 minutes. Other outlets were instituting limits of one per customer, and “one Dwen at each family” became a trending topic on Weibo, with more than 10 million viewers in 24 hours. Analysts from Shanxi Securities estimated the total revenue from official Olympic merchandise could reach 2.5bn yuan (£291.4m). Olympic mascots and associated merchandise are often hit and miss. Some remain largely unrecognised even during the Games, as was the case at the 2018 Rio de Janeiro Olympics with Vinicius or the 2002 Salt Lake City trio of Powder the hare, Copper the coyote and Coal the black bear. London’s 2012 mascots were described at the time as “phallic bugbears”, while at Sydney in 2000 the trio of native Australian animal mascots were upstaged by an unofficial wombat named “Fatso” on a late-night comedy TV show about the Games. But in Beijing, the furore around Bing Dwen Dwen has provided a way for people to feel more involved in an event they are blocked from attending. Strict pandemic protocols mean few Chinese fans can attend events, and those who do must quarantine for weeks before and after entering the dedicated Olympic bubble. Instead, people have gathered at homes and in bars and restaurants, crowding around TV and phone screens to watch a competition happening in their capital city. “It is such a shame that I can’t watch the Winter Olympics in Beijing when it is happening so close to me. However, I got my Bing Dwen Dwen today!” one Weibo user commented. Mr Tang, an employee at the Olympics media centre inside the bubble, said he was among many locals and foreigners lining up to buy one. After he posted pictures of his Bing Dwen Dwen on his WeChat, he received about a dozen offers from people wanting to buy it from him. The mascot’s popularity was “beyond [my] imagination”, he said.

2/8/2022,"The security landscape of the Baltic states and eastern Europe may be changed permanently if Russian troops amassed on the Ukraine border start to integrate with Belarusian troops, Lithuania’s prime minister has said. “This is a 1938 moment for our generation,” Ingrida Šimonytė said in an interview. “Neutrality helps the oppressor and never the victim.”  Šimonytė, who is due to meet Boris Johnson on Tuesday, is one of the European politicians most willing to make a case for democracy and expose the methods of autocracies. Her stance has led her country of only 2.8 million people on to the frontline of ideological conflict not only with Russia but also China. Belarus is threatening to block potash exports to her country, and China punished Lithuania for the opening of a Taiwanese representative office in Vilnius by cutting trade and pressing companies to pull out of Lithuania. The UK has joined Lithuania to take China to the WTO over its behaviour. Šimonytė said the twin threats from the superpowers showed it was necessary for the west not to be mired by self-doubt, internal divisions and self-satisfaction. “The first response is not to be afraid but to speak up,” she said. “We never see the masses on the streets demanding more autocracy.” The 47-year-old argued that the massing of Russian troops in Belarus may be changing the security landscape in her region and was being driven by the political weakness of Belarus’s president, Alexander Lukashenko. “After the elections and demonstrations in August 2020 in Belarus, Lukashenko is now out of options about what he can do,” she said. “Before he was flirting with the EU, releasing some prisoners for money. He played this dual strategy, but he cannot do that any more. No one regards him as legitimate in Belarus. He needs money and Russia’s help to survive. He is dependent on them. “This current buildup of Russian forces in Belarus is unscheduled. There was a Russian military exercise in 2021. If these military exercises mean weaponry and troops will remain on Belarus soil indefinitely, that changes the calculations substantially. “It will mean an increase in Nato presence, and that would not be a provocation, as Moscow claims, but a reaction to what has changed on Nato borders. This is now an area full of weaponry. Russian troops that are in the south of his country can be moved very quickly. There are sorts of hybrid attacks under way. Pipelines falling apart. This is how unfortunately these regimes operate. There are no red lines they will not cross.” Already a further 300 German troops are being flown to Lithuania. On Monday, French diplomats claimed Vladimir Putin had reassured Emmanuel Macron that the Russian troops massed in Belarus would leave, but Šimonytė said Putin pursued a policy of strategic ambiguity. “What he will definitely not do is to declare his true intentions in advance,” she said. She showed some wariness about Macron’s diplomatic mission to Moscow, saying: “I know Putin was probably feeling very happy because he feels an important guy. Everyone is coming to talk to him, and maybe that is one of his motives. This debate should not be constructed around the question of ‘what can we do to make you happy?’ but rather ‘we are serious now and when we are saying every country has the right to choose the security net for itself, we mean it’. When you are saying ‘Nato is increasing at your expense’, that is completely fake. The truth is the opposite.” She sidestepped the question of whether she felt Germany was acting as a drag anchor on sanctions, saying what would be scary was if there was a disagreement about what the west was seeing. “Sometimes decisions in democracies take longer,” she said. But she did not disguise her opposition to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, saying it increased European dependency on Russian gas and was a “very significant tool” for the Kremlin. “Even though we are close partners with Germany, we have been saying for a very long time do not increase your dependency on Russian gas,” she said. “With Putin there are no purely commercial projects. Everything can be turned into a geopolitical project.” Šimonytė questioned whether Germany’s past faith in changing autocratic regimes through trade remained valid. “For a very long time there was a consensus that if you increase trade, cultural and people’s exchanges, then somehow there will be a change in standards of living, and perceptions will become more similar. In many cases that has happened – it happened in Lithuania – but it is not universal. Perhaps empires do not change.” She called on the west to call out the hypocrisy of Russia’s oligarchs. “We have overlooked how these people are using our way of living. They like our universities, our hospitals, banks, because they know rules exist in this part of the world and no one will come and strip them of your possessions. You can go to court to protect yourself, yet at the same time they are trying to undermine our way of living in any way they can. It is very dangerous schism.”",News/World news,‘A 1938 moment’: Lithuanian PM warns about Russian troops in Belarus,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/a-1938-moment-lithuanian-pm-warns-about-russian-troops-in-belarus
2/8/2022,"The consensus that has prevailed for the past 40 years told us that monetary policy must be depoliticised, so that central banks can independently pursue the goal of price stability in the economy without catering to politicians, private finance or corporations. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, threw that impression aside last week when he suggested that workers should not demand higher wages in order to contain the inflationary pressures confronting the British economy in 2022. “I’m not saying nobody gets a pay rise” he said. But “we do need to see restraint in pay bargaining, otherwise it will get out of control”.  When central banks call for workers to yet again shoulder the pain, their role as guardians of the distributional status quo – the struggle over the distribution of national income between labour and capital – becomes clear for everyone to see. It is a misjudged call, tearing off the veil of carefully curated neutrality, and showing whose interests the Bank really protects. Bailey’s reasoning is clear. The 1970s left central banks scared of the prospect of wage-price spirals, when powerful unions obtained worker pay rises that kept pace with higher living costs, and in turn companies transferred those higher labour costs into higher prices, triggering renewed wage demands. Covid-related labour shortages, global supply bottlenecks and renewed appetite for striking threaten to reignite these cycles. But Bailey did not explain that wage-price spirals only occur if firms dump wage increases into prices, instead of simply reducing their profits. It was not, he implied, up to capital to moderate profit expectations to address inflation. Rather, workers must take (another) one for capital. Yet the Bank is aware of how bad the post-2008 decade has been for British workers. In 2017, its then chief economist, Andy Haldane, explained that the “weak wage puzzle” – surprisingly weak wage growth even during periods of booming labour markets – was not just about slow productivity growth, or slack in the labour market, but also the power of capital to “divide and conquer” workers. Decreasing unionisation eroded workers’ power to negotiate better wages and defend, let alone increase, their share of national income. The Bank’s clear stance here raises key questions about its future. First, are we seeing the limits of the institutional arrangement that put central banks in charge of targeting inflation in the first place? After all, outsourcing inflation control to workers smacks of monetary impotence. If interest rate increases, however painful to mortgage holders, cannot deliver price stability, perhaps it is time for another approach, learning from experiments of the postwar era. While these are typically dismissed as the failed wage policies of the 1970s, the National Board for Prices and Incomes, created by a Labour government in 1965 and dismantled by a Conservative one in 1970, offers a better starting point. In the words of its chairman, the Conservative MP Aubrey Jones, the NBPI sought to restrain both powerful employers and unions. In more than 160 reports on various industries, public and private, it asked whether firms could absorb higher wage and other costs by lowering profits, particularly if those profits arose from excessive market power. And rather prescient for today’s British economy, it warned that allowing firms to pass wage increases off into higher prices reduces their incentives to seek productivity gains. While the board had no powers to enforce its findings, it made a clear case for governments to engage in strategic price controls where firms could not justify price increases. Today, it would probably ask if instead of raising interest rates and removing existing caps on gas prices, the response to energy-related inflationary pressures should maintain caps, introduce a windfall tax on gas producers’ record earnings and an overdue structural reform, including public ownership, to align the energy sector with the ambitions of a low-carbon economy. The Bank, alas, is not asking these questions. Second, can we rely on the Bank to discipline fossil capital, as required by its March 2021 environmental mandate? Then, the Bank had raised expectations that it would pioneer an ambitious strategy to make private finance greener, the first among high-income countries. Shortly after this, it outlined an innovative “proof of concept” plan to decarbonise its portfolio of corporate bonds, by first lowering the carbon intensity by 25% until 2025. While its gradualism fell short of expectations, the plan ignited constructive debates about how to reduce the Bank’s subsidies to fossil capital. But in its rudderless fight against inflation, the Bank threw that plan out of the window when it announced in February that it would get rid of its corporate bond holdings entirely by the end of next year. Rather too keen, you suspect, to absolve itself from the task of penalising dirty finance, a task for which its governor seems ideologically ill-suited. Third, the Bank of England has the power to obstruct governments intent on assuming greater responsibility for price stability or climate policy. Its inflation-targeting framework dictates that it should unwind its massive purchases of government bonds undertaken to support Covid-19 fiscal measures. This would push borrowing costs higher just as governments come under increasing pressure to shield citizens from eye-watering increases in living costs and support the low-carbon transition via public investments. A central bank that is proving remarkably unwilling to discipline capital has at its disposal tools to discipline governments, all in the name of a policy framework that, by its own admission, is rather ineffective. It should instead develop new mechanisms to coordinate with fiscal authorities such as the Treasury to tackle the twin challenges of inflation and climate. If Alan Greenspan was long worshipped as the central banker who always made the right call, Andrew Bailey is now in danger of always making the wrong one – on interest rate increases, wage restraint, government debt or climate. But these times demand more credible leadership and openness to institutional change. Otherwise, to quote Ariana Grande, thank you, next.

2/8/2022,"Early one morning last February, a group of young people gathered on a street corner in Myanmar armed with brushes and buckets of paint. In the faint light of dawn, they quickly completed their task and dispersed. “I felt excited and nervous. I was scared too, because I didn’t want to get caught,” says Tu Tu, a pseudonym for the group’s organiser.  Hours later, the streets were teeming with people demanding that the military, which had seized power on 1 February, stand down. Media reports from that day show people marching and drone photographs of huge resistance slogans painted on the road. Tu Tu’s group had succeeded in its mission. It was one of many ways that the arts have invigorated the pro-democracy movement. During the first weeks after the coup, as protest chants and revolutionary songs reverberated across the country, artists energised the crowds with dance and music, and covered walls and streets with murals and graffiti. Within weeks, however, the sound of gunfire and the screams of protesters filled the air while blood stained the streets. One year on, the military has killed about 1,500 people and arrested more than 11,000 – 8,700 of whom remain behind bars. These violent crackdowns have made it too dangerous to make art in public. But some artists continue to work underground. “Art is as powerful as a weapon,” says Tu Tu. “When we fire a gun, one bullet can only hit one enemy, but if we can illustrate something clearly through art … we can spread our message much faster.” In February 2021, Myanmar's progress towards democracy was brutally stalled when the military seized power and took control of the country.   In the year since, the country has been plunged into violence, poverty and mass displacement as the military attempts to crush widespread resistance to its rule.  Internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, a ruthless curtailing of freedom of speech and escalating military attacks on civilian areas have silenced the voices of people from Myanmar.   For this special series, the Guardian’s Rights and freedom project has partnered with a diverse group of journalists from Myanmar, many working in secret, to bring their reporting on life under military rule to a global audience. Journalists in Myanmar are working in dangerous and difficult circumstances, as the military government attacks the free press and shuts down local media outlets. Many reporters still inside the country fear arrest, with others forced to leave their homes and go into hiding in areas increasingly under attack from military forces.  All the reporting in this series will be carried out by journalists from Myanmar, with support from the editors on the Rights and freedom project. These are the stories that journalists from Myanmar want to tell about what is happening to their country at this critical moment. After protesting became a life-threatening endeavour, few of Tu Tu’s friends were willing to keep painting words on the ground. They went out a few more times, but finally had to stop. “My friends were worried, so they didn’t participate any more. I understood, but I wanted to do so many things,” says Tu Tu, who requested the Guardian use pseudonyms for them and anonymise their gender and location. Determined to keep resisting, Tu Tu began making illustrations instead, and took on the artist’s name Black Art. “I don’t need much to make illustrations; I can even do it with just a pen or pencil. I can express anything based on my ideas,” they say. They have since made dozens of illustrations highlighting the crisis in Myanmar. Broken Heart shows a girl holding a pink balloon and facing a row of police; in a second image, a police officer guns her down and her balloon floats into the air. Coup Makes Orphan shows a child crying in front of a soldier shooting a protester in the head. Black Art also makes illustrations based on photographs taken across the country. The Last Kiss shows a boy at his father’s funeral, while Screaming from Myanmar has a crying girl clutching her dead father’s photograph. Spring Revolution and The Last Bow depict parents grieving over their children. Two illustrations, Heroes Never Die and They are Free Now, are tributes to five youths who jumped from the roof of a building in August to avoid being arrested by military forces; two of them died. “I even cried when I drew some illustrations,” says Black Art. “My illustrations are based on real stories and they are sad stories.” Since May, armed resistance has grown across the country and the military has responded with indiscriminate attacks on civilians. Black Art’s more recent illustrations highlight the military’s use of airstrikes and arson attacks on towns and villages. The artist told the Guardian that they see art as a way to document what is happening in Myanmar. “I want art to be left as a form of history which can be seen by the next generation, to prevent something like this from happening again,” they say. Although many of their friends have decided to take up arms against the military, Black Art remains committed to fighting through art. “I believe that everyone should be involved in this revolution, but holding guns is not enough,” they say. “We can only win this by participating in every way, and I am participating in mine with the belief that we will win.” Aye Win, a hip-hop artist in Yangon, uses music to rebel. During the protests in February, he and a group of friends held two freestyle rap events under the name Rap Against Junta before they had to go underground. “When [the military] started the crackdowns, we couldn’t meet any more,” says Aye Win. “We all moved to the internet and used different applications to connect.” In the following months, some of Aye Win’s friends joined the armed resistance against the coup, and others left the country, but Aye Win took on the role of Rap Against Junta’s director and persevered as an artist. On 30 June, the group released Dictator Must Die, a track featuring artists from Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, India, Taiwan and Myanmar. After that, they released a full album on 21 October. Called Dick Council – a play on Sitt Council, the Burmese name for the junta – it included 12 tracks by local artists. It was followed by Blood on 7 January, which features singers from eight different ethnic backgrounds rapping in their own languages. Throughout this entire process, Rap Against Junta has not held a single in-person meeting. With the military increasing its use of informants to break down the resistance movement, many of the contributing artists have kept their identities secret even from one another. “Most of the other rappers don’t know who I am and I also don’t know who they are,” says Aye Win, who connected with contributing artists through an open submission process on social media. The need to maintain anonymity, however, has made it difficult to identify people to support the project. “When we approach people for help using a fake identity, they don’t really trust us and they always put aside the proposals to collaborate,” he says. Rap Against Junta also had to adapt creatively when promoting their music. In their music videos, their faces are masked or shown in silhouette, while Aye Win has only allowed himself to be photographed behind a full mask or interviewed using voice-distorting technology. As the country’s economic crisis worsens, Aye Win also says it is becoming harder to find people who can give time to Rap Against Junta because they need to earn an income. “People are trying to make money and put food on the table, so they cannot commit like before,” he says. Aye Win is also facing pressure from his family. “My parents are discussing my future plans. I have just been stuck [at home] and doing nothing for one year. I am doing something, but it is not an established way of making a living for them,” he says. “[They said] I should go somewhere else and survive while I am still young; the future is nowhere to be found here for me.” But Aye Win sees making protest art as a serious mission. “It is a kind of revolutionary work, and we need to finish by deadlines – we have to pay attention to every detail,” he says. “We have a lot of very raw protest art here, but we have to maintain our course and go on consistently, without letting up.” Emily Fishbein is a freelance journalist writing on human rights and social justice in Myanmar.
