4/3/2022,"It seems I have got to that awkward age when I am simultaneously old enough to recoil from the new vocabulary of hipster-speak, yet still young enough to know that within a week or so I will find myself using it. The whole raft of new, often colourful gardening terminology that has accompanied the sudden influx of younger and more diverse voices into horticultural media, largely thanks to platforms such as Instagram, fascinates me. My favourite term is one I learned only yesterday from my suitably bearded and tattooed Instagram buddy @botanicalotter: plant-flexing. Adapted from 90s US rapper slang, to “plant-flex” is the horticultural version of performatively displaying one’s wealth via the use of status symbols – in this case the status symbol might be something like a variegated monstera. The idea that a humble houseplant can now be equated to a sports car or fat wad of cash might seem surprising, but single leaf nodes of some must-have species now sell for tens of thousands of pounds on online auction sites. Sadly, such inflated prices have led to online scam artists selling counterfeits, and to widespread theft from botanic gardens. They can also leave the rest of us who lack the resources (or frankly desire) to play the plant-flexing game feeling a little inadequate. Of course, having plants as status symbols is nothing new – think of the craze for tulips in 17th-century Holland or the 19th-century British obsession with unusual exotic trees. But what does this latest surge in the price of houseplants say about a hobby that was once seen as an accessible oasis in the world of gardening, relatively free from the stuffy class fixations of the rest of horticulture? As you can probably tell, I feel this new fetishisation of some plants risks creating the kind of barriers that, until recently, left a whole generation feeling excluded from the industry. However, there is another perspective. Ever since I started working in horticulture, 20 years ago, we have been complaining about how little we are paid and how no one values our skills. So it seems a bit rich to start getting cross when some of us are finally getting some kind of recognition. Do these high prices actually encourage commercial growers to adopt rare plants into the mainstream, making them available to the mass market within years (sometimes just months) of them first taking off online? The actions of a few big spenders might help expand the whole market, which ultimately may benefit regular gardeners. A few years ago there were only about 10 houseplant species to choose from as big-box garden centres continually slashed their ranges to replace them with shelves of orthopaedic shoes and meerkat-shaped solar lights. I guess the same arguments apply to industries such as fashion, art and tech, and the truth is probably somewhere in between. But for the present, I find it exciting that I am finally not the only person fascinated by house plants – even if I am now one of the oldest.

4/3/2022,"If you want a case study of how not to handle the question of transgender athletes in sport, look to the treatment of British cyclist Emily Bridges. As a talented male junior, Bridges won three silver medals at national championships and seemed destined for the Olympics. Bridges came out as trans in 2020 but had continued to participate in men’s events while transitioning. Having sufficiently reduced her testosterone levels, she became eligible to compete in women’s races. Her first such race would have been yesterday at the National Omnium Championships alongside the likes of five-time Olympic champion Laura Kenny. Bridges’s inclusion raised considerable controversy. Then, on Thursday, cycling’s global governing body, the UCI, ruled that she was ineligible as she is still registered as a male cyclist and cannot compete as a woman until that registration expires. It’s a situation unfair both to Bridges and other women riders. Having raised Bridges’s expectations and led many women riders to fear unfair competition, she was barred at the last minute – but only on a technicality. Currently, once Bridges is no longer registered as a male, she will be eligible to race in women’s events. And the whole debate will begin again. Bridges’s case closely follows another controversy, when last month Lia Thomas became the first transgender woman to win the US college swimming championship. At the heart of these debates – and not just in sports – is the distinction between sex and gender. Sex refers to an individual’s biological traits, such as their chromosomes, hormones and reproductive organs; gender to social ideas about “masculinity” and “femininity” and of male and female roles. Transgender people have a sense of their gender identity being at odds with their biological sex and resolve it by changing gender. How should society respond to the distinction between sex and gender and to differences of identity rooted in each? There is no single, simple answer. When it comes to political and civil rights, we should defend those rights for all individuals whether they define themselves by sex or gender. For trans people, we should, just as we would for women, oppose discrimination in employment, demand equal treatment in services, support equality in marriage and adoption procedures and stand up against bigotry. There are, though, areas in which the distinction between sex and gender is significant. Sport is one. In many sports, there are separate men’s and women’s competitions because having a male physique provides physical advantages. Men have, on average, larger hearts, bigger lungs, longer limbs and greater muscle mass. To give a sense of the advantage this provides, Bridges’s junior male 25-mile record (as Zach Bridges) is two minutes faster than that of Hayley Simmonds, the fastest-ever British woman at the distance. All sporting champions have physical advantages – that’s why they are champions. But the advantages Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps had over male competitors is of a different kind to their advantage over female competitors. This does not mean that men are “better” at sports than women, any more than the fact that world heavyweight boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk would probably knock out flyweight champion Julio Cesar Martinez means that he is a better boxer. Nevertheless, without sex-based categories we would see few women in the Olympics or at Wimbledon. To mitigate such advantages, many sports, including cycling, require trans women to reduce their testosterone levels. This is both unfair on athletes who may not wish to be subject to such treatment for non-medical reasons and a misplaced obsession with testosterone. Trans women who have transitioned after puberty retain many advantages of a male physique despite testosterone reduction. A study led by Joanna Harper, herself a transgender athlete and a strong advocate of trans inclusion in sport, concluded that hormone therapy reduces haemoglobin levels to normal female levels but strength and muscle mass, while reduced, nevertheless “remain above that observed in cisgender women, even after 36 months”. Another study showed that after a year of testosterone reduction, “the muscular advantage enjoyed by transgender women is only minimally reduced”. One suggested solution is to have an “open category” for all athletes, irrespective of sex or gender, together with a protected sex-based women’s category. It’s not a perfect answer. It would disadvantage trans women who lose some of their male advantage in transition. And women’s sport may end up seeming like a kind of ghetto. Nevertheless, it’s an attempt to think through the conundrum of sex and gender in sport rather than ignore it or pretend it does not matter. Some dismiss the worries as overblown hysteria, pointing out that there are only a few trans athletes and that, far from taking over sport, they are underrepresented. That’s true, though the numbers may not be so low in 20 years’ time. In any case, it’s a question not of numbers but of formulating principles and practices that welcome trans athletes without undermining sex-based categories in sport. Some argue, too, that any restrictions on trans athletes taking part in women’s sports are “transphobic” because they suggest that trans women are not women. It’s an objection that fails to distinguish between sex and gender. Cyd Zeigler is co-founder of Outsports, a website about LGBTQ athletes. He supports “inclusion for [trans] athletes in their gender category”. Disagreeing with that, though, he points out, is not necessarily transphobic. Many “who think that trans women should be treated as women in employment, in housing, in education, on their driver’s license” nevertheless also question their place “in women’s sports”. To discriminate against trans people in the workplace, to refuse to serve them in a shop, to object to trans adoptions, to deliberately misgender as a means of humiliating someone – that is bigotry. To argue for sex-based categories in sport – that is not. To deem both “transphobic” is to diminish the meaning of the word. We can only work our way through these conundrums with open discussion rather than dismissing disagreement as “hatred”. Such rhetoric only stokes fear and resentment and makes it more difficult to come to an equitable solution. Trans people face considerable prejudice and discrimination. We cannot challenge that, though, by undermining women’s rights. The problem does not lie with Lia Thomas or Emily Bridges. It lies with sports authorities who have ducked the issue and those who would shut down the debate rather than work through the difficulties. Sooner or later, we’re going to have to debate this as grownups.

4/3/2022,"Ninety-nine years and eight months old, Anna Bahatelya has survived every ordeal a tumultuous century of Ukrainian history has thrown at her. Born in August 1922, four months before the proclamation of the Soviet Union, Bahatelya lived through the Holodomor, when Joseph Stalin’s regime visited an artificial famine on large areas of Ukraine by confiscating its grain stocks. She survived the second world war, even after spending two years in a Nazi slave camp in Austria. She has outlived the Soviet Union and then made it through the difficult 1990s, when the Ukrainian economy left many in poverty. This January she survived a vicious bout of Covid, despite being unvaccinated. Now, four months short of her century, she faces yet another challenge: Vladimir Putin’s war on her country. “Now again, the people are suffering,” she said at her home on the outskirts of Kyiv, where she lives with her 69-year-old daughter, Olha Punyk. Speaking loudly, with an imploring tone and the cadence of poetry, Bahatelya gives sharp and clear recollections of the various ordeals she has been through, but grew angry when asked about the Russian president, making a rude hand gesture and calling him: “The worst man in the world.” Her hearing these days is not so good, but even she can hear the loud booms coming from Brovary, just a few miles from her home on the edge of the capital, which was pounded by Russian strikes in the first part of the war. Punyk taped over the windows in her mother’s room and has brought dark curtains for the windows, but said the renewed military action has brought back traumatic memories for her mother.Most people over 80 in Ukraine have lived through a lot. One historian has termed Ukraine and the wider region “the bloodlands” – the territories caught between the violence of Hitler and Stalin that saw terror, war and the Holocaust in the mid years of the 20th century. Sometimes, the most practical option has been to try to shield older people from the realities of the new war to prevent the traumas of the past returning. At one old people’s home in Kyiv, the director has spent the past weeks doing everything to shut out the fact that life outside is in any way different. “A lot of my people have absolutely no idea what is happening outside the fence,” said the director, who asked not to be named. Some elderly people are all too aware, however. Anatoliy Ruban, 84, lives alone on the far western outskirts of Kyiv, just a short distance from the Russian forward positions outside the city. There has been constant shelling nearby since the war started. “I hear everything: the explosions and the sirens. When it’s loud, I sit in the bathroom until it’s finished,” he said. Ruban was a child during the second world war in Kyiv, but he remembers it vividly, and the recent action has brought the memories flooding back. “I remember my mum put me on a cart and we rode out of the city, and I remember bullets flying around above my head,” he said. After the outbreak of this war, Ruban declined the suggestion that he should leave Kyiv for a safer place in western Ukraine or Europe, and indeed has still been going to work for the past month, working 24-hour shifts as a janitor at a youth sports hall.“I take it all calmly, I’ve seen war with my own eyes before. A person is forced to adapt to everything. I refuse to go anywhere, and nobody is waiting for me anyway,” he said. Ruban served in the Soviet army in the late 1950s and used to count Russians among his friends, but said he was now disgusted with the neighbouring state and particularlyits leader. “Putin is the scariest man in the world – I just hope that lunatic doesn’t press the nuclear button. That’s what I’m really scared of,” he said. Bahatelya is also aware of what is happening, though her daughter does her best to shield her from the worst of it. “I try to turn the television off when there’s news about the war – she just gets very upset and starts talking about the last war,” she said. In June 1943, after the Nazis occupied Bahatelya’s village, she was sent along with millions of other women to be an Ostarbeiter, the term the Nazis gave to civilians captured in occupied territories and forced into slave labour inside the Third Reich. She spent two years living in a camp in the small Austrian town of Ternitz and working in a factory there. “We had a quarter loaf of bread in the morning and a thin soup twice a day, then potatoes on Sunday,” she recalled. When the war was coming to a close, as Soviet soldiers moved westwards, Bahatelya went the other way, walking to Budapest before journeying home by train to find her whole village destroyed. Back then, she considered herself a patriotic Soviet citizen and the Russians to be a fraternal nation. Her daughter said: “She told me that when Stalin died, she cried. She cried sincere tears, because they thought it was a tragedy. They were zombified back then, just like the Russians are zombified by their propaganda today.” Asked what she would like for her 100th birthday, Bahatelya said she had one wish: “I’d like him to die,” she said. It was clear who she meant.",News/World news,‘What would this Ukrainian like for her 100th birthday?

4/3/2022,"How long will the western democracies maintain present levels of support for Ukraine? The war’s economic impact, already manifesting itself through spiralling inflation and living costs, could have seriously negative political consequences for elected leaders in the US, Germany, France and the UK. If public willingness to make difficult sacrifices diminishes in the months ahead and the conflict slips off the front pages, will they stay the course? As Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is keenly aware, western love for his country is already highly conditional. Military assistance is limited by Nato’s fear of provoking Vladimir Putin. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, is “over-eagerly” pushing for a negotiated deal at the risk, British officials claim, of overriding Kyiv’s best interests. Accused by his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen, of ignoring domestic problems, Macron’s poll lead has narrowed before this month’s two-round election. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is currently fixated on the security of domestic energy supplies, not the future security of Europe. He knows Putin’s threat to cut off the gas, if implemented, would spark a national emergency. Scholz’s ruling coalition is creaking after a row with the Greens, who say he and his former boss, Angela Merkel, were “blind” to the risks of energy dependence on Russia. This argument will only intensify, the longer the war continues – and not only in Germany. “Europe should stop spending up to €800m per day on purchasing Russian gas,” a new paper from the Centre for European Reform argues. “In 2021 … Russia exported more than 49% of its oil and 74% of its gas to Europe.” Halting all such purchases voluntarily, it said, might be the most effective sanction Europe could impose. “The political will to take such a radical step is still absent.” And, sadly, likely to remain so. Joe Biden’s Nato and EU summitry last weekend did not produce a much-needed long-term plan for defeating Russia or better weapons for Ukraine’s defenders. But it did raise questions about his leadership. Biden’s crisis management has brought a modest poll boost. A new survey showed 61% of Americans believe higher petrol prices, up 20% in a month, are worth it to beat Russia. Most support additional US troop deployments. But this spirit of solidarity is finite. Biden looks tired and vulnerable, with a low overall approval rating of 41%. Only 39% approve his handling of the economy. This is the battlefield that matters most in the US as a neo-Trumpist Republican party eyes a takeover of Congress in November. This is why the White House has tapped its strategic oil reserves. Will stumbling Biden stay the course, or seek a quick way out? In the US and EU, early anti-Putin momentum seems to have stalled and may even be reversing. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, urged Brussels last week to swiftly introduce a fifth sanctions package. But foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the EU would “maintain” rather than “elevate” pressure on Moscow – the overly cautious approach favoured by Paris and Berlin which infuriates Poland and the Baltic republics. Russia is actively exploiting these divisions. “The irresponsible Brussels sanctions already negatively affect the daily life of ordinary Europeans,” a foreign ministry official said. Western leaders risked making their peoples’ situation worse, the official added, amid fresh Russian threats to block food and agricultural exports. Meanwhile, China and India give succour to Putin by buying discounted Russian oil. Ukraine-related pressures on western leaders are undoubtedly escalating across the board. The IMF warned last month that the war would cause “devastating” damage to the global economy as well as deep recessions in Russia and Ukraine. One forecast published last month predicted a £90bn hit to the UK alone as consumers and businesses struggle to recover from the pandemic. In Spain, the far-right populist party, Vox, has used rising prices to fuel anti-government demonstrations. Similarly politicised protests have been seen in France, Italy and Greece. Worries about a wider war, meanwhile, may help Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s Putin-friendly prime minister, win re-election this weekend. It may be that western politicians will keep their word and honour their commitments to Ukraine. Or maybe not. Zelenskiy, for one, has his doubts. Speaking to the Economist, he expressed reservations about the trustworthiness and reliability of some leaders, including Boris Johnson. “Britain wants Ukraine to win and Russia to lose … It is not performing a balancing act,” Zelenskiy said. But he added that he was unsure whether Johnson secretly hoped the war would drag on, thereby weakening Putin (and strengthening Johnson). Zelenskiy said Germany’s “pragmatic” Scholz was mistakenly “on the fence” and urged Orbán to pick a side. His harshest words were reserved for Macron’s government. “They are afraid,” he said bluntly. If the war grinds on into the autumn, as many predict, economic pain, especially over energy costs, resulting political stresses, “sanctions fatigue”, increased public apathy, and the daunting financial cost of open-ended military assistance, humanitarian aid, and millions of refugees could combine to critically undermine governments’ support for Ukraine’s fight. A western failure on this scale would be a disaster for Ukraine’s people, Europe’s security and common decency. But it’s possible to see how it might happen. Putin, of course, is watching, waiting for fatal cracks to appear. Yet he, too, faces deeply threatening internal tensions and challenges, as western intelligence chiefs noted last week. They suggest he’s at odds with his generals, is out of touch, and could be losing control. Maybe this is how the war ends. Not with a bang or a shabby deal but with a slow collapse. Who will last longer: Putin the deluded, paranoid war criminal, or the motley crew of unreliable western politicians who oppose him?",Opinion/Opinion,Will western leaders cut and run as the costs of the Ukraine war mount?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/03/will-western-leaders-cut-and-run-as-the-costs-of-the-ukraine-war-mount
4/3/2022,"After her wonderfully engrossing feature debut, Only You, writer-director Harry Wootliff turns to a rather more toxic relationship, balancing elements of romantic melodrama and psychological thriller in a film powered by modern gothic passions. Loosely adapted from Deborah Kay Davies’s book True Things About Me, it’s a disturbingly seductive (and often unexpectedly funny) portrayal of manipulation and deceit that gets right under the skin of its protagonist, brilliantly played by Ruth Wilson, who walks a tightrope between enchantment and endangerment. With great physical poise and precision, Wilson (who optioned and developed the source book) engages the audience on a visceral level, her deceptively low-key performance taking us deep inside her character’s dreams, desires and insecurities. Wilson plays Kate, a somewhat tremulous thirtysomething daydreamer whose personal life has stalled and who is just about holding down a humdrum job at a benefits office in Ramsgate. When a charismatic claimant (Tom Burke) cockily asks what she’s doing for lunch, Kate flirtatiously throws caution to the wind and soon finds herself in an unexpectedly erotic car-park encounter that is as thrilling as it is risky. Like Kate, we know little or nothing about her mesmerising new lover, whom she names Blond, but whose particulars (his history, his status, even his whereabouts) remain enigmatically vague. What we do know is that Kate becomes instantly addicted to his pointedly unpredictable attentions, craving his calls and his company, infatuated with his presence – all the more so in his frustratingly frequent absence. Kate’s friends and family are understandably suspicious, none more so than Alison (Hayley Squires), who has been trying to fix Kate up with a suitable partner with whom to settle down. For Alison, this interloper is just another bad decision – a chaotic presence that has overtaken the needy Kate’s life, clouding her senses and her judgment. “So you’re going to rescue him are you?” asks Alison when Kate insists that their dependence is mutual, even when Blond effectively makes off with her car. Yet whenever he reappears, the spark is rekindled, keeping alive the possibility that a better, more exciting life awaits Kate, just beyond her reach. Wootliff has described True Things as “a cautionary tale of a destructive sexual relationship that is both complex and ordinary”, adding that this relationship seems “so familiar” as to be “almost a rite of passage”. While Wootliff may be referring specifically to “a woman’s sense of self” as explored or defined through relationships, the film’s appealcrosses gender boundaries. Anyone who has ever defined themselves through the eyes of others, or sought self-worth in unworthy romance, will recognise both the agony and ecstasy of Kate’s predicament. That tension burns at the heart of True Things, making Kate both a passive observer of and active agent in circumstances beyond her control. Crucially, no matter how much her passion devours her, it also drives her – albeit to distraction. Having brilliantly embodied the suavely duplicitous Anthony in Joanna Hogg’s The Souvenir, Burke here seems to channel the spirit of Oliver Reed, investing his character with a blend of animal magnetism and fear of intimacy that feeds hungrily upon Kate’s own conflicted responses. When he tells her that she’s “lovely”, there’s something of the fairytale wolf about his words, as if he were preparing to eat her. Yet, like Red Riding Hood, Kate is more resourceful than she seems. In Only You, Josh O’Connor and Laia Costa danced to the anguished strains of Elvis Costello’s I Want You in a scene that showcased Wootliff’s ability to tell a story through movement and music. Dance plays a crucial role in True Things too, as PJ Harvey’s Rid of Me soundtracks a defining scene of character-driven choreography in which Wootliff and Wilson work in perfect harmony with cinematographer Ashley Connor, whose close-up expressionist images have a tactile, sensuous quality. Plaudits, too, to composer Alex Baranowski, whose plucked, processed sounds create a sonic backdrop that perfectly captures Kate’s anxiously evolving spirit, simultaneously evoking impending catastrophe and ecstatic escape.",Arts/Film,True Things review – seductively dangerous liaisons in Ramsgate,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/03/true-things-review-seductively-dangerous-liaisons-in-ramsgate

4/3/2022,"Iceland is often labelled the best place in the world to be a woman, as well as the safest country on Earth. But many Icelandic women roll their eyes in frustration at such claims. “That is crap,” says 35-year-old Hulda Hrund Guðrúnar Sigmundsdóttir. “This has been shoved down our throats ever since we were little. We’re told we’re so safe, while at the same time our mothers are warning us not to talk to men.” Sigmundsdóttir is a member of Öfgar, a new feminist group made up of nine Icelandic women who have been collating and sharing anonymous stories of sexual violence by powerful men. Their recent actions have taken the small country by storm and sparked a resurgence of the #MeToo movement. Over the last year, several Icelandic men in positions of power have stepped down or been fired over allegations of harassment, misconduct or sexual offences. The list includes men who had been working in the media, politics, business and football, as well as others in positions of power. Some have apologised but most have denied the allegations against them. Sigmundsdóttir says Iceland’s long-held reputation as a feminist paradise has prevented women such as her from speaking up about abuse. “It’s a silencing tactic,” she says. “We are told we should be grateful because other countries have it worse than us.” One in four women in the country have been raped or sexually assaulted, according to a study by the University of Iceland, which had more than 20,000 participants. That is higher than estimates for the EU and the UK. On top of this, many women feel the justice system works against them when it comes to allegations of gender-based violence, with the vast majority of cases reported to police not making it to trial and few resulting in a conviction. A number of women have even gone as far as to sue Iceland at the human rights court, accusing it of failing to protect them from gendered violence. That’s why Öfgar – which means “radical” or “extreme” in English – decided to take the matter into its own hands when it formed last summer. Öfgar began when the women, who are all survivors of sexual assault, started to talk on a feminist Facebook group and decided to start a TikTok account together. At first, they posted educational videos about consent and sex education. But when they say they received 32 allegations of assault against the same Icelandic musician, they decided to post the women’s stories. He has denied the allegations. “Overnight, the ball started rolling really fast,” says Helga Ben, 28, one of the members of the group. Since then, hundreds of survivors have shared their stories. They have also taken on Icelandic football, promoting an allegation of sexual abuse against a forward for the men’s national team. Following their campaign, the entire board of the Icelandic Football Association resigned over the alleged cover-up. Öfgar says it checks that the women who write to them are real by looking up their names in the “Book of Icelanders”, a database that contains genealogical information for most of the Icelandic population. It says it also fact-checks the claims by trawling through old social media posts. On top of sharing allegations, Öfgar has had meetings with members of the media in Iceland and tried to persuade them to change the way they write about survivors of sexual violence. “We had a meeting with one of the biggest media in Iceland [DV] and we held a masterclass,” says Sigmundsdóttir. “They promised to do better – and they have done.” In Iceland, women who speak out against abuse are often “slut shamed”, Ólöf Tara Harðardóttir says. So people find it easier to speak anonymously with Öfgar as a buffer. “Survivors feel they can trust us,” says Ben. In a small country where everyone knows everyone, the women have met with a backlash. “The media have portrayed us as angry women, and as money-greedy attention whores,” Harðardóttir says. “They use the ugliest pictures they can get of us.” The women in Öfgar also say they have received death threats, along with calls begging them to stop. “I have had phone calls, saying they knew where I lived,” says Harðardóttir. “I also had messages on Instagram saying I should kill myself. We got an email saying someone will end up dying if you don’t stop.” Þórhildur Gyða Arnarsdóttir, 26, says she has also been the subject of abuse. “When you step forward with your name, you get these vicious attacks. The comment sections are horrible. You get slut-shamed,” she says. In public forums, people have written that they should be shot, raped or sent to Afghanistan. Ben says some posts also imply people are following them and taking photos. Sigmundsdóttir says some of the abuse scares her. “I loved the time that Covid [rules] made us wear masks,” she says. “Because we were hidden.” However, the group insists it won’t stop them. “For me, it isn’t a choice,” says Tanja M Ísfjörð, 27, another member. “We need to do this.” “We have had enough,” says Harðardóttir. “We need to stand up and say, ‘this is going to stop here, we’re not going to be afraid of you’.”",News/World news,The safest place in the world to be a woman?

4/3/2022,"Ministers are being warned against loosening the rules around the number of children nursery staff can care for, after it was revealed that regulations are being examined as a way of cutting costs for parents. Expanding the number of children per staff member or relaxing other rules are being reviewed by children’s minister Will Quince, who is undertaking an international comparison as part of attempts to tackle the cost of living crisis. It comes amid evidence of spiralling childcare costs. One recent survey found that some pay as much or more for their childcare as for their rent or mortgage, while 43% of working mothers said they were considering leaving their jobs because of high childcare fees. However, the authors of a government-commissioned study warned that dialling down regulations would make the childcare staffing crisis even worse. Low-paid staff could leave, with no guarantee that any savings would be passed on to families, they said. Quince caused immediate concern among nursery providers when he revealed he was looking at the issue last week. A 2013 study concluded that allowing more children per staff member would lead to “a reduction in quality”, adding: “Quality childcare is expensive but there is little evidence that high fees are a function of regulatory requirements. However, the converse is true – that very lax regulatory regimes lead to poor-quality provision.” Eva Lloyd, professor of early childhood at the University of East London and a co-author of the report, said the report’s findings were “even more relevant today than they were then”. She said so-called “ratio relaxation”, which would allow staff to care for more children, “might prove a disaster for the sector”. “Current staff recruitment problems already threatening quality are likely to be exacerbated by ratio relaxations,” she said. “More staff may leave – having to work even harder for abominable rates of pay. The recent growth of large private for-profit childcare groups has seen staff costs kept down, while parental fees increased substantially.” Professor Helen Penn, her co-author, agreed that loosening the regulations would be “a very bad idea”. The number of children a childminder or nursery worker can look after varies by the setting they work in, their qualifications and the age of the children. For nurseries, one adult can care for four children aged two. For children three and over, where a staff member has the appropriate qualifications, they can be responsible for 13 children. Dr Sara Bonetti, director of early years at the Education Policy Institute, warned that comparisons with other nations were potentially misleading. “It’s positive that the children’s minister wants to learn from successes abroad but we would caution against ​comparisons,” she said. “Some European countries may have higher staff-child ratios but it’s important to note that their approaches to the early years can be very different, with staff qualified to degree or master’s level, and with a wider team of support staff in place in settings that aren’t counted in ratios.” Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said ministers were returning to an idea rejected by government nine years ago after a fierce backlash. “Relaxing ratios will do little to reduce childcare costs and will simply place increasing and unnecessary pressure on an exhausted workforce. Education ministers are well aware we have a recruitment and retention crisis never witnessed before, so it beggars belief that they would wish to consider such a shortsighted approach. “What’s more, this completely ignores the interests of the child. They are not a commodity in some financial calculation to balance the books.” The costs of childcare have been growing, with experts suggesting they will rise significantly this year. “Every business will see costs increase through increases in national insurance contributions and the minimum wage coming in,” said Ellen Broomé, managing director of the Coram Family and Childcare charity. “I don’t think the UK is an outlier [on regulations]. Actually, we have quite low-qualified and low-paid staff, compared internationally.” Ministers are also said to be looking at other ways to help with childcare costs. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, said recently that he was seeking to “improve the cost, choice and availability of childcare”. A government spokesperson said: “The early years of a child’s life are the most crucial, which is why we have invested more than £3.5bn in each of the last three years to deliver the free childcare offers, including the 30 hours per week for working parents, which is supporting thousands of families. We are also investing millions to transform services for parents, carers, babies and children, including through Family Hubs, where families can access important support services. “We continue to look for ways to improve the cost, choice and availability of childcare, and alongside this we have recently announced the biggest ever increase in the national living wage, from April 2022, to support working families more widely.”",Lifestyle/Money,Easing nurseries’ staffing ratio in the UK would be childcare ‘disaster’,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/03/easing-nurseries-staffing-ratio-in-the-uk-would-be-childcare-disaster
