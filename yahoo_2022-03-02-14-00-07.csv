3/2/2022,"Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) was booed by her colleagues for heckling President Joe Biden as he spoke about Afghanistan and Iraq veterans and his late son, Beau Biden, during his State of the Union address. Biden was speaking about the effects of “burn pits” that “incinerated wastes of war — medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more,” saying some veterans battle “a cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. I know.” After that remark, Boebert shouted, “You put them in, 13 of them,” referencing 13 service members who died last year in a bomb attack in Kabul. Democrats booed Boebert after the outburst. Biden continued without acknowledging Boebert’s comment, mentioning his son, who died of brain cancer in 2015, by name. “I don’t know for sure if the burn pit that he lived near ... in Iraq, and earlier than that, in Kosovo, was the cause of his brain cancer, or the disease of so many of our troops, but I am committed to finding out everything we can,” he said. Boebert tweeted about the moment after the speech, claiming she “couldn’t stay silent” when she heard Biden refer to “flag-draped coffins.” Earlier in the speech, Boebert and her colleague Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) attempted to start a “build the wall” chant as Biden spoke about immigration, but it didn’t take off. The Daily Beast’s Matt Fuller reports someone told them to “sit down.” Boebert also made a sartorial statement during Tuesday’s event, wearing a shawl featuring the phrase “drill baby drill.” Outbursts from lawmakers during presidential addresses aren’t particularly common. In 2009, Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) made headlines for shouting “You lie!” at President Barack Obama during a health care address in front of a joint session of Congress. The taunt was later used against him by his own constituents at campaign events in 2017. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/2/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Several dozen Japanese men have answered a Ukrainian call for foreign volunteers to fight Russia's invasion, according to a media report on Wednesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Sunday for the formation of an ""international legion,"" prompting dozens from the United States and Canada to volunteer. As of Tuesday, 70 Japanese men - including 50 former members of Japan's Self-Defense Forces and two veterans of the French Foreign Legion - had applied to be volunteers, the Mainichi Shimbun daily said, quoting a Tokyo company handling the volunteers. A Ukrainian Embassy spokesperson acknowledged receiving calls from people ""wanting to fight for Ukraine,"" but said they knew nothing further about volunteers. A Feb 28 social media post from the embassy said it thanked Japanese for their many inquiries about volunteering but added a proviso. ""Any candidates for this must have experience in Japan's Self-Defence Forces or have undergone specialised training,"" it said. In a new post on Twitter on Wednesday, the Ukranian embassy in Japan said it were looking for volunteers with medical, IT, communication, or firefighting experience. It was not immediately clear if the volunteer positions were remote or involved travelling to the country. Japan has told its nationals to put off travel to Ukraine for any reason, a warning reiterated on Wednesday by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, who said he was aware of the reports about the volunteers. ""The Japanese foreign ministry has issued an evacuation advisory for all of Ukraine and we want people to stop all travel to Ukraine, regardless of the purpose of their visit,"" he told a news conference. ""We are communicating with the Ukrainian embassy in Japan and pointed out that an evacuation advisory is in place.""

3/2/2022,"Li Yayuanlun, the 31-year-old Chinese man who previously claimed he had been kidnapped as a “blood-slave” in Cambodia, reportedly fabricated his story, according to the Chinese embassy.

Li had allegedly been lured into a false job advertisement by a gang before he was abducted and sold into another gang running an online fraud company who had used him as a “blood slave” for months, according to previous news reports. He then had supposedly managed to escape while in a poor physical state and was admitted to a hospital on Feb. 12.

The Chinese Embassy requested Cambodian police conduct an investigation after the case caused a stir on Chinese social media. They concluded on Monday that Li’s story was a “fabrication.”

The Cambodian police informed the embassy that Li had been smuggled into Cambodia before he contracted a serious liver disease, which led him to ask for assistance from a local social organization, according to the Sixth Tone.

While no names were publicized, the police have detained three people who reportedly assisted Li in fabricating his story to hide his illegal entry into Cambodia.

The case will be transferred to the Cambodian judicial authorities, according to the Global Times.

The Chinese embassy remains “highly concerned” about the case and will continue to follow up on it to “protect the legitimate rights and interests of relevant parties under the legal framework of China and Cambodia,” according to The Star. The embassy has also called on Chinese people residing in Cambodia to “abide by the laws of both countries,” urging them not to engage in deception.

3/2/2022,"Fox News’ national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin again called out her own network’s questionable coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On Sunday, Griffin slammed retired U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc’s on-air suggestion that America should provide more “combat help” to Ukraine as being “way off the mark in terms of talking about what the U.S. could do on the ground.” U.S. and NATO don’t have soldiers fighting in Ukraine amid fears it could spark a nuclear war, Griffin noted. “The Ukrainians are very good fighters,” she said. “They are a tough group of fighters. They do not need Americans to fight for them. That would cause this to spread.” “Clearly, Brig. Gen. Bolduc is not a student of history,” she continued. “He’s a politician. He ran for Senate in New Hampshire and failed. He’s not a military strategist, and to suggest that the U.S. would put indirect fire or special operations or CIA on the ground to give Putin any sort of excuse to broaden this conflict is extremely dangerous talk at a time like this.” Watch the video here: More fact checking of guests from Jennifer Griffin: Clearly he isn’t a student of history.

I share those facts internally so that our network can be more accurate. That’s what I’ve always done.
