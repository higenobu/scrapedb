5/2/2022,"Watching plays on television does require a certain mindset. Appearing as part of BBC Four’s Sunday Night Performance strand, Prisoner C33 is a brand new one-man play about Oscar Wilde’s time in Reading Gaol. It’s written by Stuart Paterson, directed by Trevor Nunn, and stars a very good Toby Stephens as Wilde, playing two very different versions of the writer in conversation with each other. If you are in the mood for an hour of one man talking to himself about the great misfortunes of his life, in a dim, candlelit cell, while the perforated eardrum that would contribute to his death causes him great pain, then this is a poetic and well-crafted play that I imagine would be even more electric on stage. That hour doesn’t stretch patience or outstay its welcome. It begins with an animalistic moan, deep in the bowels of the Victorian prison, its candles and iron gates lending this a gothic chill. The moan is not coming from Wilde, yet, but from a disturbed man a few cells down, whose mutterings earn him an off-screen beating from a guard. This is 1895, and Wilde is in prison for gross indecency after the details of his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas, his beloved Bosie, became public knowledge. He would emerge from his sentence having written De Profundis and with the material for The Ballad of Reading Gaol, but C33 is more concerned with what Wilde had to endure, and the ultimate cost of that. Stephens plays him as a wretched, tortured soul brought to the depths of despair by his predicament. He’s cold, hungry, sick, dirty – and bored. “I can bear anything except losing my mind,” he says, as if the prospect is imminent. Perhaps it was. Most of the drama concentrates on this wretched version of Wilde, a man who can only refer to himself by his prisoner number, in conversation with his younger self – a witty, elegant man, dressed in immaculate velvet, with rouged cheeks, who is urging his counterpart to strive for survival. “I say, remember yourself for who you are. A great and exceptional man,” says the young Oscar to the prison Oscar, who refers to his surroundings as “this tomb for those who are not yet dead”. Nunn directs with utter sparseness, as if for a stage production, and, clearly, this is about the dialogue and the performance (or should that be performances?). Wilde debates grand subjects with himself. He rails against England and “sound English common sense” and the English education system. He talks of morality and art and faith and God. Is art useless? Is he ashamed of the success of The Importance of Being Earnest, a play he wrote in haste for money, that the young Oscar says will be performed for the rest of time? Wilde’s ego and snobbery come and go. He is ashamed of his materialism, yet finds solace in imagining rich fabrics and good French soap. There is much to say about love, too, from the betrayal of “sweet Bosie” to his adoration of his wife and children, though we know that he would never see them again. He wonders if his ability to see “all the beauty in the world”, in men and in women, makes him a superior man. It would truly be a crime if this famous wit were not allowed a glimmer of comedy in his musings, and among the trauma and the horrors, there are plenty of moments of sly humour. If his sexuality is superior, should he expect an honour from the Queen? “Well, certainly a tax rebate, at the very least,” he quips. It is not an easy watch, and I mean that quite literally. The conditions of a prison in 1895 were grim, and the idea that his cell “lacks a woman’s touch” is laughable; no woman could improve on that filthy, freezing cesspit. It is dark and gloomy (if this were BBC One prime time, there would be issues raised by the viewers who complain about mumbling), its protagonists looking for light in the shadows, and there is a piercing, high-pitched noise every time Wilde repeats his refrain of “If it was not for my ear …” But Stephens is remarkable, and gives it his all as both the wreck of a man who would live only for another four years, and as the suave, younger Wilde, exhorting his older, ruined counterpart to live. A man imprisoned for gay sex might be a relic of the past in this country, but it makes a pitch for contemporary relevance in other ways, too. “We cannot keep on living like this, governed by fools who think only of wealth and of war and the size of their estates,” Wilde rages, adding a touch of timelessness to this sorry, sad tale.",Arts/Television & radio,"Prisoner C33 review – Trevor Nunn directs a wretched, wonderful Wilde ",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/01/prisoner-c33-review-trevor-nunn-wretched-wonderful-oscar-wilde-toby-stephens
5/2/2022,"Good morning. An Australian climate scientist says the national science agency has been turned into a “very extravagant consulting company”. US President Joe Biden’s $33bn request for more aid to Ukraine is likely to be approved. Scott Morrison will be campaigning in Sydney, while Labor leader Anthony Albanese will be in Brisbane. Housing, social care and electric car charging are expected to be on the election agenda. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, made a pitch for a “better future” at his official campaign launch in Perth, outlining new policies to try to capture voter attention. The party has veered away from the big-spending and revenue-raising promises of the last election campaign. But Albanese pledged on Sunday that if he wins the 21 May election “the work of building that better future will start the very next day”. Here are the five key policies unveiled by the Labor party on Sunday. Notably, Labor has promised to reduce the cost of medicines on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, roll out new charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and focus on improving pay equity for women. Some believe Albanese presents as a leader who wasn’t born thinking he was owed the prime ministership. Joe Biden’s $33bn request to Congress for more aid for Ukraine is likely to receive swift approval from lawmakers, a senior Republican said on Sunday, as the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, made a surprise visit to the war-riven country. The US president on Thursday had asked for the money for military and humanitarian support for Ukraine as it fights to repulse the Russian invasion now in its third month. Meanwhile, Russia has bombarded Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, as part of its renewed push in the east of the country, while claiming the “draft of a possible treaty” between the two countries is being discussed on a daily basis. A leading Australian climate scientist says the national science agency, CSIRO, has been turned into a “very extravagant consulting company” under the Coalition, with its scientists barred from speaking publicly about government policy. The warning from Prof David Karoly follows his retirement from the Commonwealth Science and Industry Research Organisation in February after more than 40 years as one of the most respected voices in climate science. Karoly says scientists at CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology are routinely blocked from speaking publicly and have their work suppressed if it could be interpreted as at odds with government policy. An area of heritage-listed bushland that formed part of the environmental offset for the western Sydney airport has been bulldozed for a car park at a new defence facility. The clearing was revealed in an independent audit of the federal government’s progress in delivering the offsets required to compensate for the destruction of endangered habitat for the new travel hub in Badgerys Creek. Irrigation issues dominate the federal election in Coalition-held Nicholls, the nation’s sixth-safest seat, with Liberals, Nationals and an independent all in the running. The Reserve Bank of Australia finds itself in a strategic and political bind. Will the RBA lift the cash rate this week to counter inflation – or wait until after the election? In the central highlands north-west of Melbourne, farmers are fighting plans to install 85-metre towers through their properties. We asked Guardian readers across Australia what mattered to them at the local level. These are some of their responses. A report released in April by BirdLife Australia reveals the economic impact of birdwatching tourism, with domestic birding trips contributing an estimated $283m to the Australian economy annually, much of this in regional communities. John Coates, the vice-president of the International Olympic Committee and outgoing president of the Australian National Olympic Committee, said “to a large extent” Sydney was awarded the summer Olympic Games in 2000 because it “bought the Games”. Jacob Zuma has been accused of systematic and “unlawful” efforts to give business allies control of billions of dollars worth of state assets by the judge charged with investigating wrongdoing during the former president’s years in power in South Africa. Ministers are under increasing pressure to help free a retired British geologist at risk of facing the death penalty in Iraq over smuggling allegations. A petition urging the release of father-of-two Jim Fitton, has received more than 95,000 signatures in the three days since it was launched. The United Kingdom government faces intense pressure from its own MPs and opposition parties to take action over misogyny and harassment in Westminster after a senior minister denied institutional problems, saying the issue was simply “some bad apples”. In the final minutes of the final episode of the genre-defining mockumentary The Office, our favourite disenchanted worker, Tim (Martin Freeman), neatly summarises the banal rhythms of the early 2000s workplace. “The people you work with are people you were just thrown together with,” he muses, noting that he spends more time with colleagues than his own friends or family. “But probably all you’ve got in common,” he adds, “is the fact that you walk around on the same bit of carpet for eight hours a day.” From The Office to Severance, Amelia Tait writes about how the fictional workplaces went from bad to worse. At the beginning of each month, Guardian Australia editors and critics pick out the upcoming book titles they’ve already devoured – or can’t wait to get their hands on. From Janine Mikosza’s Homesickness to Isobel Beech’s Sunbathing, here are the best Australian books out in May. Losing someone you love dearly is devastating, but the bond couples shared in life is vital to those who live on. “In my work I have seen many examples of how love continues, transforms even, when the loving object is gone,” writes Juliet Rosenfeld. “Eventually, someone becomes defined, not by loss, but by love.” The announcement last week that the Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, had secured the funding to buy Twitter sent shockwaves across the internet. Rightwing free speech absolutists celebrated the acquisition, while many on the left sounded alarm bells about the implications of one wealthy man taking control of such an influential communication platform. The Guardian’s UK technology editor, Alex Hern, tells Michael Safi that Musk’s acquisition of Twitter is a classic case of a billionaire splurging on a hobby.

5/2/2022,"Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has fallen victim to cutbacks at Netflix, according to a US report that said the struggling streaming giant has dropped plans for her animated series Pearl. Announced to fanfare last summer, with Meghan as its creator and executive producer, the “family series” was to have focused on the adventures of a 12-year-old girl inspired by historically influential female figures. It was to have been the first animated production under Meghan and her husband Prince Harry’s Archewell brand, which was created in 2020 as a vehicle for their new careers in the US, following their separation from the British royal family. Netflix, once dominant among streaming platforms but now wrestling with slumping subscriber numbers and a collapse in share value, dropped the project amid a wave of cutbacks, according to Deadline. Referring to the decision unflatteringly as “a royal flush”, the entertainment industry website said the project Meghan was co-executive producing with David Furnish, who is married to Elton John, was axed in the development stage. “Word in town is that even before recent events, Netflix had been telling producers to take some development projects elsewhere,” the report said. “Clearly, Netflix’s inordinately high content spend is being reevaluated. It is just unreasonable to expect its execs to manage that many projects, and have enough of them turn out to be memorable.” Netflix did not immediately comment. There was also no immediate reaction from Archewell, leaving it unclear if the company would continue production on Pearl or attempt to move it elsewhere. Other Archewell projects with Netflix, including the documentary series Heart of Invictus, about Harry’s Olympics-style Invictus Games for disabled former service members, are believed to be unaffected. The former working royals, who live in Montecito, California, signed a multi-year deal with Netflix in September last year. Netflix has dropped two animated series not produced by Archewell, Dino Daycare and Boons and Curses, according to the Hollywood Reporter. In publicity material for the announcement of Pearl last summer, Meghan said she was excited. “Like many girls her age, our heroine Pearl is on a journey of self-discovery as she tries to overcome life’s daily challenges,” she said. “I’m thrilled that Archewell Productions, partnered with the powerhouse platform of Netflix and these incredible producers, will together bring you this new animated series, which celebrates extraordinary women throughout history. “David Furnish and I have been eager to bring this special series to light.”",News/UK news,Netflix drops Meghan Markle’s animated series amid cutbacks – report,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/01/meghan-markle-netflix-drops-animated-series
