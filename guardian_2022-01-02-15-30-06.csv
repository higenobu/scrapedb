1/2/2022,"New year, new you, new sowing plan? Happy 2022. May your gardens grow. Rows of cockleshells, optional. Now we know January can be a cold month, likely to harbour frost. So it’s worth checking your plot one early-ish morning to see where the icy patches are. Avoid siting tender plants there. There’s still much other stuff to do – Including staying snug inside.  It is time, from now, to order seed potatoes for planting out in late February or March. We stick to first earlies, probably something waxy, though I am also prone to being seduced by a pretty burgundy or purple potato. Rules as usual: leave in a tray on a cool (unheated) dry place in natural light. I will stick to chitting in egg trays with most ‘eyes’ upwards as I learned from Dudley, my dad. You must do what you think best. If your ground isn’t frozen, you can catch up with broad beans. And even garlic, but we will wait a couple of months and maybe add onions (though I’ll admit to quite constant disappointment). I often choose to admire Mary’s instead. Either way, you should be able to buy/order onion sets and garlic now. Sort though seed packets and planting plans for the year if you haven’t already. It takes me a few goes in a fairly futile attempt to be ruthless. If nothing else, it’s good to check for damaged packs or insect infestation, particularly if you store seed in a shed. We’ll also order our rarer stock around now in case it sells out later in the season. We’ll flirt with making plans for what to grow where through the year, though it is unlikely we will stick to it if past years are an indicator. Howard or I tend to stand where we think the bed or row might go while the other has a think. So please be more you than me. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

1/2/2022,"Guinness, 0.0%, from £4, 4x440ml can, Tesco, Asda, Morrisons There are two ways to approach a month off the sauce, as many of us have vowed to do this January. Either you go for non-alcoholic drinks that are their own thing, and always have been (of which more below). Or you can adapt what I like to think of as the Linda McCartney model: weaning yourself off your favourites with a clever simulacrum that doesn’t contain the substance (animal products for Linda; alcohol for you) you’re trying to avoid. As someone who would happily own up to being vegan-curious but not quite ready to move beyond flexitarian status, I’ve eaten my share of Quorn sausages, beetroot-blood burgers and fake chicken schnitzel- type things, and I’m impressed by just how far they’ve developed in the past couple of years. Realistic booze substitutes have moved on, too, with the choice now extending far beyond the lonely bottle of Clausthaler (itself much better than it was), and with the latest big brand 0.0% contender from Guinness coming extremely, satisfyingly close to the real thing. La Gioiosa Italian Sparkling White, 0.0% £5, 75cl, Morrisons Other convincing low-alcohol beers that I’ve found can fill in a flavoury gap without the alcohol include Estrella’s crisply refreshing Spanish lager Free Damm (from £4.50, 6x330ml, Sainsbury’s Morrisons and others) and two IPAs: Connecticut-basedzero-alcohol specialist craft brewer Athletic Brewing Co’s citrussy, balanced IPA (£10.99, 6x355ml, uk.athleticbrewing.com) and East Anglian brewer Adnams’s 0.5% version of its trusty Ghost Ship (£10.99, 8x500ml bottle, adnams.co.uk). What all four beers I’ve mentioned here (and other top-notch no-alcohol brews)get right are the richness of texture and depth of flavour : there’s nothing watery about them. This is something winemakers haven’t managed to achieve just yet. The best wines are low-alcohol (with around 7-9% abv)rather than no alcohol. The most drinkable zero-alcohol wines make up the textural shortfall with sugar and bubbles, so the sweetly fizzy end result of a wine, such as La Gioisa’s, is more fizzy pop than prosecco-alike.  LA Brewery Strawberry & Black Pepper Kombucha, £35, 12x300ml, LA Brewery The most common advice that vegan chefs proffer to people making the switch to a plant-only diet (as, again, so many of us are doing for what I suppose I’m going to have to call ‘veganuary’ this year) is to try to break away from meat-centred thinking – don’t treat vegan cuisine as coping with something missing; think of it as an opportunity to celebrate all the many and diverse ingredients found beyond the meat counter. And of course, you can take the same approach to going alcohol-free. Admittedly, this is easier to achieve online: outside big urban centres, pubs and restaurants still rely on standard sweet fizzy drinks or mineral water as alcohol-free alternatives. Still, it would be hard I think, for any palate used to the complexity of the best alcoholic drinks to feel they were missing out if they were offered something as deliciously sweet-sour-spicy as the strawberry and black pepper kombucha (fermented tea) of Suffolk’s LA Brewery.

1/2/2022,"Sarap Filipino Bistro, 10 Heddon Street, London W1B 4BX (020 3488 9769; saraplondon.com). Starters £8.50-£13; mains £18-£25; desserts £5.50-£7.50; wines from £27 Eating a whole piglet is like staging an orgy; you need more than two people to get the job done. The problem is that, when I review a restaurant there are only ever two of us, and that makes both propositions very tricky. Admittedly the latter is rarely on the menu during restaurant visits; neither of us is likely to be orgy fit. But at Sarap Bistro the former most certainly was an option, and I was at least four people short of a piglet party.  Sarap belongs to the chef Ferdinand “Budgie” Montoya, and is part of his ongoing exploration of the food of the Philippines, where he was born. Key to that is the famed lechon: roast piglet, with golden, shattering skin and the tenderest, sweetest of meat. (If you are a meat eater with a taste for lamb, but still want to be absolutely livid about the consumption of young pigs, muster your arguments now.) Here, the lechon comes stuffed with lemongrass and truffled adobo rice. Sounds great doesn’t it. There’s only one problem: you have to order a whole damn piglet two days in advance, and muster a party of six to eight people to do the eating. It costs £295. About 10 minutes after we arrive there is a cheer from the far end of the dimly lit dining room. A small crowd is gathered, cameraphones aloft. I wander down to find them recording the portioning up of their piglet, plumes of steam rising from the chopping board as Montoya works the cleaver over the meat. The legs go one way, the snout another. I take a few pictures, but end up feeling like an interloper at the celebration of a stranger’s birthday. I am not friends with these people. I cannot share their piglet. Well, in truth, I probably could have done if I’d asked nicely. I could have told them I was Grace Dent and they’d instantly have told me to fill my boots. I can rock a leopard-print wrap dress, me. The point is that, the most diverting item on the menu here at Sarap (which means delicious) is the one I can’t order. Still, there are a bunch of other things available and by the end of the night, following the beguiling instructions of our waiter, I will have tried all but one of them. Montoya has been on a long and twisting journey to get here, both figuratively and literally. He only started cooking professionally when he arrived in the UK in 2012 from Australia. He worked at Restaurant Story, Foley’s and the Dean Street Townhouse, while all the time nurturing a desire to interrogate his family’s favourite dishes. It began with a supper club which led in turn to various pop ups, and then a casual place in Brixton Market. Now he has taken over this spot on Heddon Street, which has become a bit of an incubator for new restaurant ventures; previously, it was home to the rugged nose-to-tail Italian Manteca, which has moved on to Shoreditch. Montoya describes what he is doing here as delivering authentic flavours “proudly inauthentically”, a thoroughly engaging term I first came across in chef Ravinder Bhogal’s Jikoni cookbook. It’s a short menu. Our enthusiastic waiter tells us we should order three starters between the two of us. There are only three starters. The food here strikes me as a softer, often warmer version of the sharp, sweet and salty flavours I am used to from elsewhere in southeast Asia. Pearly pieces of seabass are cured in a soft sour coconut vinegar. There is a gel made from calamansi, or Philippine lemon, and for crunch there are pieces of cucumber. It’s all bright and refreshing. In the mellifluously named Ensaladang Talong it is the addition of crumbled salted duck egg which shifts a rough smoked aubergine purée and slices of tomato away from the Mediterranean. But the most compelling dish, because it nods towards the lechon, is a boned out, rice-stuffed pig’s trotter, with skin that is hinged in a remarkable place between crisp and chewy. It feels a little like a consolation prize for not being able to give the piglet a seeing to. It’s a good consolation prize. There are four main courses. We are told we should order three. The most diverting are the hunks of roasted celeriac in a ripe, creamy peanut sauce, with the lightest waft of truffle. Poussin has been marinated in lemongrass, citrus and vinegar before being grilled over charcoal to produce the kind of savoury blackened skin which gives point to these small, often flavourless birds. Finally, there are rosy slices of beef, in a thick citrus and soy sauce. It’s very good beef indeed, though the £25 charged for four less-than-vast slices is ambitious. (Amusingly, they plated six slices of the beef for the dish prepared for the photographer who visited a few days later.) Still, we have a bowl of rice with which to absorb the gorgeous liquor. These are I think, all meant to be showstoppers. Intriguingly, the most thrilling dish is actually a simple side of kale braised for hours in coconut milk, ginger, garlic and chilli. It is both comforting and a wake up; an intense, rich vegan stew which I wanted to lean over and focus on. At £6 it also feels like the best moment of value on the menu, for we are just off Regent Street and that is rarely a cheap place in which to be. I am amused by what feels like blatant upselling by our waiter at the start, however encouragingly done. It does mean the bill mounts. Then again, we do not finish up over fed. Desserts are solid and sustaining rather than light and refreshing: a mildly rubbery cassava cheesecake with coconut milk; a log of sweetened glutinous rice with a coconut caramel. Those aside, I like Sarap Bistro very much. The food is unfamiliar in a good way and the execution is precise. It just seems unfortunate that lechon which, for good or ill, is the Philippine’s most famous dish, is not available to individual punters. Without a way to access that roast piglet it makes the experience feel a little like the culinary equivalent of Hamlet without the prince, or Jaws without the shark. Or maybe it’s just that it forces me to confront the fact that I don’t have enough friends; or at least not the kind of friends happy to help me demolish a piglet.

1/2/2022,"New York City’s new mayor, Eric Adams, was sworn into office soon after midnight yesterday. It was a fitting time of day for a cop-turned-politico who has indicated that he plans to return some personal panache to a metropolis knocked by a pandemic, political strife and an outgoing mayor whose polling ranks beneath even Donald Trump with state voters. For the moment, Adams’s administration is, as one acquaintance put it, “in the ether”. The Democrat told the city council last week: “We must allow our city to function. We have thrown $11bn at Covid, so the day has come when we need to learn to be smarter.”  Adams got right to work. He took the subway to City Hall on 1 January to be at his desk by 8.30am, and held a cabinet meeting half an hour later. Signs are he’ll be more focused than his predecessor Bill de Blasio, who campaigned on raising taxes and spoke divisively of a “tale of two cities”. On Friday, the New York Post described Democrat De Blasio as the city’s worst ever. And that’s with 109 mayors to choose from. The New York Times, nominally friendly, found space to list his achievements only as creating universal kindergartens, eating pizza with a fork, setting a record for tallest mayor and accidentally dropping a groundhog named Charlotte, which later died of its injuries. De Blasio’s major achievement, the Times noted, was spending money – the city’s budget is at a record $102.8bn and its workforce at a 325,000 record high. Yet over the eight years of De Blasio, the city has come to seem slower and more ponderous, as if the mayor were re-making it in his own image. Traffic lights were set for delayed green, confusing the timing of jaywalkers, incensing drivers and perhaps benefiting only angry cyclists. Ubers began clogging up the city where yellow cabs had sped – sometimes without stopping for a fare in a fashion that looked anti-Darwinian. Adams comes with less ideological baggage than De Blasio, whom the Post calls “Cuba-loving” . He is unlikely, for instance, to make his first order of business to try to ban horse-drawn carriages from Central Park and then pointedly allow wealthier sections of the city to go unploughed after a major snowstorm to indicate that he, as a populist Brooklynite, does not consider Manhattan the centre of the New York City universe. He appears, in many ways, more accustomed to the rhythm of the city and its relationship with its commercial reason for being. Business leaders, hoping to stem an exodus of firms and high-earners, say they see signs that Adams will be more focused on economic development and on addressing rising crime levels. He has promised not to restore “stop-and-frisk” policing that unfairly targeted minorities, and to revive a plainclothes police unit to focus on gun crime. Black Lives Matter chapter leader Hawk Newsome threatened “riots, fire and bloodshed” if Adams restored the unit. Adams replied: “We’re not going to surrender to those who are saying, ‘We’re going to burn down New York.’ Not my city.” He has told business leaders to construct a database to match vacant jobs to jobseekers, adding: “This is going to be a place where we welcome business and won’t turn into the dysfunctional city that we have been for so many years.” But he may find resistance from the city council, centre of New York’s shift to progressive politics. Clashes are brewing over a plan to reinstate solitary confinement at the city’s brutal Rikers Island pre-trial detention complex. “I’m going to ignore them,” Adams said last week. “If they like it or not. I’m the mayor.” But there are subtleties to Adams’s approach. He loves the nocturnal nightlife scene, looking in on a charity dinner, or a play, before dropping by Zero Bond, one of the city’s new private clubs. “When you’re out at night, it helps decrease crime. It attracts tourists to the city,” he said recently, adding that every time a New Yorker goes to a restaurant “we’re making sure that a dishwasher, a cook, a bartender and a waiter is employed.” It’s a strategy that Serge Becker, nightlife force behind art nightclub AREA, La Esquina restaurants and others, says helped the city reinvent itself in the late 70s and 80s. “Populated streets are safer than abandoned ones. It helped build communities, and Mayor Adams is sending encouraging signals that he has a nuanced view of nightlife – that it has a positive role to play in revitalising the city.” But there’s a question mark over where Adams sleeps. Some say New Jersey, others Brooklyn or that he puts his feet up at the office for a few hours. It seems that he’s happy to keep people guessing. “I’m just as flexible as the city. I’ll be in New York,” he told NY1 in November. “The 24-7 city that never sleeps. We have heard the alarm clock. We are up now.”",News/US news,Eric Adams sworn in as mayor of New York City,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/02/eric-adams-sworn-in-as-mayor-of-new-york-city
1/2/2022,"The contrast between the upbeat tone of the prime minister’s new year message and the political cloud hanging over him as he goes into 2022 could not be starker. Boris Johnson said Britain is in an “incomparably better” state in the fight against Covid than it was at the start of 2021; thanks to the scientific research that produced a vaccine in less than a year, that is certainly true. But Johnson begins the new year as an irrevocably weakened political figure, his poll ratings significantly down from a year ago, his authority within his own parliamentary party eroded. Just two years after winning a decisive parliamentary majority of 80, this will be the year that requires him to fight for his survival.  While 2022 will hopefully bring a diminishing of the disruption and harm caused by Covid, it will also see the launch of the independent inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic. Johnson’s dreadful errors of judgment over the last 21 months will be raked over: his decisions to hang back in introducing social restrictions not once, not twice, but three times cost too many people their lives, and still more the hardship of living under harsher social restrictions for longer as a result of his delays. The inquiry may also uncover further revelations about Johnson’s hypocrisy in his approach to enforcing the social restrictions he imposed on the country within his own residence. The Cabinet Office investigation into the Downing Street parties will report and, if it generates evidence that the law was broken, may even lead to a police investigation. Johnson will also continue to face scrutiny over his lack of probity around declaring political donations. The country is facing an acute cost of living crisis that the government has made immeasurably worse through its policies. A decade of tax credit cuts enacted by successive Tory chancellors – which effectively paid for tax cuts for more affluent families – has eroded the incomes of low-paid parents, for some households by thousands of pounds a year. Yet this did not stop Johnson enacting a further tax credit cut of £1,000 a year in October, the biggest overnight benefit cuts for low-income families with children in history. The increase in generosity of the universal credit taper rate the government introduced in November still leaves three-quarters of families on universal credit worse off, and despite the pandemic, unemployment benefits are now at their lowest real rates since 1990. These cuts will hit families living in the constituencies the Conservatives won from Labour in the so-called red wall much harder than those in their heartlands and will make it even harder for families to cope with fast-rising housing, energy and food costs. It is likely that the cost of living crisis – and the lack of government support to help the lower-paid weather the storm – will further damage Johnson in the coming months. The Brexit that Johnson so coveted as a cynical route to the premiership will also continue to throw up difficulties. The key Brexit conundrum remains unsolved: there is no Brexit that involves a complete break with all of the EU’s regulations and institutions that is compatible with both no border in the Irish Sea and no border on the island of Ireland. Given that the UK willingly sacrifices sovereignty in exchange for trade in other trade agreements, it seems extraordinary that this should become the sticking point of principle over which Conservative politicians are willing to undermine the Good Friday agreement. But thanks to the ideologues of the Eurosceptic right, that is where we are. Johnson’s approach thus far has been to pretend this irresolvable dilemma does not exist, misleading the public that the Northern Ireland protocol would involve no customs checks on goods coming from Northern Ireland into the rest of the UK. And the insidious economic impact of Brexit will continue; voters do not need to associate its economic malaise with Brexit itself to hold the government responsible for the state of the economy as we move towards the next election. Voter discontent with the government has translated into a consistentpoll lead for Labour in recent weeks. This creates a window of opportunity for Keir Starmer to position Labour as a government in waiting, one the country can get behind. There have been some important achievements in the first 20 months of Starmer’s leadership. He has begun the journey towards rooting out antisemitism from his party, suspending Jeremy Corbyn from the party after he minimised the findings of the statutory regulator, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, on antisemitism in Labour. He has introduced rule changes that should help ensure future leaders are more appealing to Labour voters. And after a botched reshuffle last May, he has recently promoted promising talent to Labour’s frontbench. What he has not yet succeeded in doing, however, is communicating to voters how Britain would be different under a Starmer premiership. To be fair, this is difficult for any opposition leader to achieve in the first year or two of a new parliament and even harder when there is an ongoing national crisis that has quite rightly dominated the political discourse. But 2022 will be a make-or-break year for Starmer as to whether he can succeed in mustering enthusiasm among voters alongside their growing disenchantment with Johnson. It is far too early to write him off altogether, but we begin 2022 with a glimmer of hope that there may be an end in sight to the corruption, hypocrisy and incompetence of Boris Johnson and the damage his premiership continues to wreak on Britain. That is sufficient to make the new year wishes for good health, wellbeing and prosperity glow with a political optimism that was absent 12 months ago.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on UK politics in 2022 | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/observer-view-on-uk-politics-in-2022

1/2/2022,"There are valid concerns about conventional livestock, but vegans also have blindspots (“No meat please, we’re British: now a third of us approve of vegan diet”, News). Stem-cell meat may feed richer countries some day and less conventional livestock such as snails, mussels and capybara may also help, but dramatic reductions in the impact per head of cattle, chickens, etc, are already possible via changes to feed and additives and regenerative methods. Food security is also crucial. Crops can fail badly but free markets absurdly punish suppliers if surpluses are produced, land is used for short-term gain and there is still no defined responsibility for food security. Failure to restore fish stocks could prove suicidal if crops fail badly because of climate change, pests and diseases.  The whole “eat this, not that” approach is the wrong way round; naive idealism and factory farming apologists are opposite sides of the same counterfeit coin. Better supplies must be the priority, with future consumption based on this.Iain ClimieWhitchurch, Hampshire Going plant-based prevents animals from enduring miserable lives and violent, terrifying deaths. It’s better for the environment and slashes the risk of suffering from cancer, diabetes, heart disease and strokes. Fortunately, ditching meat, eggs and dairy has never been easier. Vegan options are plentiful in supermarkets, restaurants and takeaways. From plant-based eggs to vegan meat, dairy-free cheese, and ice-cream, the choice is huge and growing by the day. Eating vegan is a compassionate choice that stops suffering and can boost your health.Jennifer WhitePeta UK, London N1 Michael Savage’s piece about John Caudwell potentially withdrawing financial support for the Tories because he’s disappointed with Boris Johnson raises the question – should anyone be funding any political party? (“Top Tory donor slams Johnson as new poll shows strong Labour lead”, News) Surely the way to indicate our dislike of the direction a party is going is at the ballot box. The idea that individuals or companies influence politics with money is distasteful. The main parties should receive funding solely from public funds so that they are beyond the influence of lobbyists and the wealthy. Should the wealthy have spare money they could over-pay their taxes, or contribute to deprived areas of society rather than trying to influence power. Government should be to the benefit of all members of society.Robert MorganHarlow, Essex If the individualists are incapable of collectivist engagement then those of us who view this pandemic as a public health issue first and foremost can adopt their libertarian philosophy (“Which philosophy helps us confront the crises that beset us... ‘we first’ or ‘me first’?”, Comment). Therefore, I exercise my right to not teach you, your children or husband or wife or partner who refuses to wear a face mask in class, to not stack the supermarket shelves with the food you want to buy, to not spend my money in sectors you think vital to the economy and beneficial to your consulting role or pension plan or dividend, to not drive your train and any other myriad roles where I serve you.

By donating an equivalent gift aided amount to an aid agency we will, over the year of the survey, have recycled £1,000 of the government’s own money back into overseas aid and so done something to mitigate the effect of its cut in funding last year. If all participants in the survey did the same thing the government would have repaid, through us, a quarter-of-a-billion pounds.

1/2/2022,"The question My teenage daughter has been depressed for 18 months. During the past two years, I have been in the process of separating from her dad and their relationship has deteriorated to the extent that when we move apart she says she no longer wants to see him. She is not attending school and is struggling to engage with learning despite it being an important exam year. I have taken a step back and, together with the school, we have allowed her to only go in when she can, maybe for an hour or two. Her father sees this as giving in and allowing her to be “lazy” and says giving her this freedom means she will just take advantage. According to him, she needs more structure and discipline, and she needs to get used to the fact that pressure is a part of life. It feels as if he can’t acknowledge that she is depressed, despite her GP confirming this to be the case. I can see she has started to respond well to having the pressure taken off.  My daughter and I have always had a good relationship and she confides in me a lot. Her dad and I have very opposing parenting styles, which is partly what led to us splitting up. He lacks the ability to empathise and listen to her. Unless both her parents believe in her, she tells me, she won’t be able get through her depression, so there’s no point in trying. We are due to move apart soon. In the meantime, how can I help her to believe in herself? Philippa’s answer I think what I’m going to say might be very difficult for you to hear. But I hope for the sake of your child you hear me out. You seem to be so driven and burning to be right that you cannot see that there might be another way of looking at this situation. Now, I might have got this wrong, I have only your email to go on and I am reading between the lines, but it feels as though you may be playing a game of “me-right, you-wrong” with her dad. It almost feels to me as though your child might be a pawn in this fight. I know you are desperate to do your best for your child, but I’m fearful that – unintentionally – you may not be. You have got the school and the GP on side. I’m fearful that this is like lining up chess pieces to win a game. If you could try to understand your ex’s fears and concerns for your daughter he might be more willing to listen to yours. Your teenager sounds conflicted. On the one hand she very dramatically doesn’t want to see him again, but on the other, she wants him to believe in her, she needs his good opinion. When your ex moves out of the family home, your daughter will lose her dad in her everyday life and from your letter I don’t see anyone focusing on that. I imagine, to her, it might feel as bad as losing a leg. It might feel like she is being convinced one of her legs, that’s held her up all her life, is no good. A greater part of your world when you are a child is your family, your mum and dad. And in lockdown that world will have got even smaller. Imagine what it does to you when that world splits apart in an unamicable way. It’s not as though she’s an adult and can just choose another house share. A child may unconsciously see themselves as part mum and part dad and if one part or both parts say the other one is bad, well it’s not surprising if it makes a child feel uneasy in themselves. Some kids are more resilient than others, but some are sensitive and when their parents argue or appear to hate each other they experience this as trauma. To a child, the only solution their psyche may come up with when parents are warring is to throw in their lot with just one parent. It’s quite complicated to see each one as a mixture of good and bad and so it’s easier to make one good and the other bad. These processes are largely unconscious and when we cannot process our difficult feelings into words it can be a cause of depression. You and your ex-partner have taken up polarised positions. You both need to exercise some give and take to come to a compromise. Your daughter has thrown in her lot with you. And if you describe him to her as somehow lacking, you are in danger of alienating her from her father. Don’t be in league with her against her dad. Her home being in flux and about to fall apart could be a reason she is too distressed and depressed to go to school, as there is a crisis at home. It is not unknown that when parents war a child may become ill. I’m sorry if this is hard to take in and, as I said, I may be reading the situation wrong, but to make sure your split doesn’t exacerbate your daughter’s depression I urge you to make an appointment for the three of you at the Family Separation Clinic (familyseparationclinic.com). This clinic offers a specialist service to families experiencing separation, in particular where a child is rejecting a relationship with one of their parents. Also, I recommend listening to my BBC Radio 4 documentary about parental alienation called When Parents Split, available online.

1/2/2022,"Toby Helm  Liz Truss In the latter part of 2021, Liz Truss has been everywhere in the media. And as she sets her sights on reaching No 10 one day, we should expect to see and hear much more of her in 2022. Appointed by Boris Johnson as foreign secretary in September, Truss has been frantically upping her profile ever since. Late last year, Russian state media mocked her as “the new Iron lady” after she appeared atop a British tank in Estonia. Then Truss issued a Happy Christmas message to the nation – and the world – via Twitter, posing Queen-like, in front of a giant globe and the union jack. It seems to be working. In a recent ConservativeHome poll of Tory activists, Truss topped the list of potential successors to Johnson, ahead of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. In her new international role, Truss, 46, has been busy playing up her enthusiasm for personal liberty at home and a small state. She also stresses her patriotism and her enthusiasm for Brexit. But it was not always so. Truss was a Liberal Democrat at Oxford University and campaigned against Brexit in 2016, warning it would be bad for freedom and the economy. Now she wants to be ready for a possible 2022 leadership contest in which the votes of pro-Brexit Tory members will be key in determining the final outcome. Wes Streeting While Labour’s progress under Keir Starmer has at times been faltering, the rise of Wes Streeting has been relentless. Streeting, who was brought up in a council flat in Stepney in the east end of London, was promoted in Starmer’s recent reshuffle to be shadow health and social care secretary, at the age of just 38. After one of his first Commons appearances in his new role, in a debate on more Covid restrictions, even Tory MPs noted his ability, marking him out as a potential future leader. Streeting was educated at a London comprehensive school and was one of the first pupils who had received free school meals to reach Cambridge University. He funded his time at university, where he became Student Union president, by working part-time as a shop assistant. He is also a former president of the National Union of Students. Before being elected to parliament as the Labour MP for Ilford North in 2015, Streeting worked in the charitable, voluntary and private sectors, and as a Labour councillor. He was head of education at Stonewall, the charity for LGBT rights, and is a patron of LGBT Labour. Earlier last year, he had to take time out of politics having been diagnosed with kidney cancer from which he is now recovered. Heather Hallett The name Baroness Hallett may mean little to most people outside the upper echelons of the legal establishment, but from early 2022 she will be in the news as much as anyone in public life. Lady Hallett, 71, a former senior appeal court judge, who also served as coroner in the inquest into the July 2005 terror attacks on London’s transport network, has been appointed to chair the official inquiry into the Covid-19 pandemic, which begins in the spring. The fact that hearings will be held in public means she will be firmly in the media spotlight. The draft terms of the inquiry are expected to be published early in the new year, after which Hallett will undertake a public consultation – including with bereaved families and other affected groups – before getting the process under way. Organisations representing families who have lost loved ones from Covid have welcomed the appointment of the respected crossbench peer. But they insist that they will be pressing her to uncover the full extent of mistakes by government and the reasons why it and the NHS were so underprepared for the pandemic. Robin McKie Martin Landray Prof Martin Landray, of Oxford University, is co-founder of the Recovery trial, the world’s largest study aimed at finding potential treatments for Covid. Over 46,000 patients have been recruited to the project whose successes have included the discovery of the benefits of dexamethasone, a cheap steroid drug that has subsequently saved the lives of more than a million severely ill patients. Now Landray is expanding those efforts. First, he and his colleagues stand ready to include potential treatments for flu as part of the Recovery project. In addition, he is set to launch Protas, a not-for-profit organisation which will work with the NHS and others around the world to harness the power of large-scale randomised trials to assess potential treatments for cancer, heart disease and dementia. “We have seen in this pandemic just how important clinical trials such as Recovery are in understanding which of many promising treatments are truly beneficial for patients and which, despite hope and expectation, are not. We now plan to apply the lessons learned from that experience to find new ways to prevent and treat other diseases that place huge burden on patients and the NHS.” Melissa Thorpe Melissa Thorpe has a simple goal for 2022. She wants to put Cornwall on the map – as a space power. She has plans to make the county the first place in Britain to host the launching of a satellite into orbit round the Earth. Later this year a modified 747 jet, run by Virgin Orbit, will take off from Spaceport Cornwall, based at Newquay. It will carry a rocket strapped to its underside and, at a height of 35,000 feet, it will separate from the plane and be fired to propel its satellite cargo into orbit. The probe, Kernow Sat 1, will measure levels of plastic pollution in the ocean. Virgin Orbit has already launched satellites this way – over the Pacific – and has plans to use Spaceport Cornwall as its European base. “Instead of customers having to take their satellites to a rocket pad, Virgin Orbit comes to a site near you to offer a launch,” says Thorpe, a Canadian economist with a background in the aviation industry. At least six other UK spaceports – one in Wales and the rest in Scotland – are set to begin launches over the next few years, with Britain aiming to corner a significant share in the placing of small- to medium-sized satellites into low orbit round the Earth. In the case of Spaceport Cornwall, Thorpe says it is hoped to create about 150 jobs for those working on satellite assembly, programming and data analysis with a further 240 jobs likely to be set up in the supply of goods and providing other services for the Spaceport. Megan McCubbin Zoologist, conservationist and photographer Megan McCubbin has become a regular stalwart on the BBC’s seasonal Watches series, on which she has worked on with her stepfather, Chris Packham, since 2020. She had stepped in to join the programme when Packham’s regular Cape Town-based co-star, Michaela Strachan, was unable to travel to the UK because of Covid travel restrictions. Since then, McCubbin – who is an experienced wildlife photographer and who studied zoology at Liverpool University – has become the youthful face of conservation in the UK after presenting Springwatch, Autumnwatch and Winterwatch on BBC Two in 2020 and 2021. She is now set to return to our screens with Winterwatch 2022, where she will be stationed at the wetland centre at Castle Espie in Northern Ireland. Vanessa Thorpe Freddie de Tommaso It is certainly the era of the overnight, stand-in star in the world of live performance, largely courtesy of the virus that has disabled many performers. The problem is now so widespread among casts that those stepping up into lead roles at short notice are no longer even the official understudies. It is a chance that can sometimes mark the start of a long career, of course, as the life of the late Sally Ann Howes showed. The Truly Scrumptious actor from the musical Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, who died last month aged 91, was originally the replacement for Julie Andrews on stage in My Fair Lady. But tenor Freddie de Tommaso, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was already on the radar of many opera fans when he took over the role of Cavaradossi in Verdi’s Tosca at the Royal Opera House earlier than planned a few weeks ago. Since then, the 28-year-old has consolidated his right to the spotlight. The Observer’s music writer, Fiona Maddocks, was not the only one to suggest the rather tired accolade “the new Pavarotti” might actually be justified. De Tommaso came on halfway through the production when American singer Bryan Hymel, suffering with a cold, could not continue. In doing so, he became not only the first Briton to sing the role at Covent Garden in almost 60 years, when Charles Craig sang the part, but also the youngest ever to do so at the famous venue. De Tommaso was also following in the footsteps of Luciano Pavarotti, who made his own debut there as an understudy in La Boheme in 1963. Liz Kingsman Two of the nation’s favourite small-screen actors, Ruth Wilson and Jodie Comer, are due to make appearances in one-woman shows at the West End’s Harold Pinter theatre this spring – Wilson first in the The Human Voice and then Comer in Prima Facie. And yet perhaps the most interesting speculation surrounds the future of Liz Kingsman, whose own solo effort, which is actually called One Woman Show, is now selling out at London’s Soho theatre. The writer-performer has created an affectionate spoof of the popular new genre of women’s shows inspired, like the triumphant Fleabag, by the personal experience of 21st century womanhood, in all its gory glory and unlikely chaos. Kingsman’s comic parody of the use of the “hot mess” heroine as a dramatic device has been winning plaudits across the board. Monica Ali Readers who have been drawn into the fictional worlds created by Monica Ali, the writer who came to fame with the acclaimed bestseller Brick Lane in 2003, will soon have a new work to seek out. The author’s much-anticipated fifth novel, Love Marriage, is out in February. It tells the story of Yasmin Ghorami, a medic engaged to fellow doctor, Joe Sangster. As their wedding day draws closer and Ghorami’s parents get to know her fiance’s uncompromising, feminist mother, both families are forced to confront old secrets and ancient treacheries. Ali’s heroine also begins to question what the phrase “a love marriage” really means, when set in opposition to the arranged marriages that are still often the norm in south Asian culture. The book, like Brick Lane before it, is also earmarked for a screen treatment, with Ali adapting a script. Simon Tisdall Valérie Pécresse Valérie Pécresse has a fair-to-middling chance of becoming France’s first female president in the spring when she challenges Emmanuel Macron, who is seeking a second term. This prospect came about due to two unexpected developments. First, Éric Zemmour, a racist, Islamophobic TV pundit, threw his hat into the ring. His candidacy looks like splitting the far-right vote that the veteran National Rally (formerly National Front) leader, Marine Le Pen, thought was her own. Second, Pécresse last month became the first woman to lead Les Républicains – the mainstream conservative Gaullist party – after besting hopefuls such as Michel Barnier, the Brexit negotiator. Pécresse, 54, is no ingénue. She is president of the Île de France regional council, which includes Paris, and was a senior minister during Nicolas Sarkozy’s presidency. She will also face Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, the Socialists’ candidate, in the first round. If Pécresse prevails, her most likely run-off opponent is Macron, who currently leads in national opinion polls but whose support is soft. Pécresse, controversially, has moved to the right in order to neutralise Le Pen and Zemmour. Macron’s advisers worry she could also steal centrist voters on whom he depends. Xi Jinping Xi Jinping is often described as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. He may also be the most dangerous. Since becoming president in 2012, Xi, 68, has eliminated most internal opposition within the Communist party, in part through anti-corruption purges. He has cracked down on dissent in traditional and online media and limited personal freedoms. His unoriginal “Thoughts” have been written into the party’s constitution and his “China Dream”, a developmental vision, has led to large-scale economic reforms, centralised control of China’s cutting edge technology sector, and the ambitious Belt and Road global investment project. But it’s Xi aggressive foreign policy stance, more than his domestic authoritarianism, that worries western leaders. He has greatly boosted military spending and is building new nuclear weapons. Having crushed democracy in Hong Kong, Xi threatens Taiwan with invasion, even as he asserts China’s sovereignty over the South China Sea and oversees border clashes with India. At this autumn’s 20th party congress, Xi is expected to win an unprecedented third presidential term. But that will not slow him down. Xi is a man in a hurry, intent on making China the undisputed global No 1 and securing his historical place in the party pantheon. Amy Coney Barrett Amy Coney Barrett’s lifetime appointment to the US supreme court in autumn 2020, on the eve of the presidential election, was celebrated by Donald Trump and his far-right supporters as a watershed moment. Her confirmation gave conservative-minded justices a 6-3 advantage on the court. Democrats found it all the more galling in that Barrett, 49, replaced the highly respected liberal justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in September 2020. In the coming year, the consequences of this shift in power are likely to be sharply felt, most saliently in the case of Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that underpins nationwide abortion rights. Arguments in recent test cases, to be adjudicated by the court in 2022, strongly suggested Barrett will vote to overturn or severely limit abortion rights. Her recent suggestion that women should put their newborn babies out for adoption, rather than terminate unplanned or problematic pregnancies, caused widespread offence. Liberals fear Barrett may also cast regressive votes on other hot-button issues such as same-sex marriage, the climate crisis and voting rights, amid widespread fears that Republicans are planning to steal the 2024 election, as Trump tried to in 2020. Priya Elan Lourdes Leon Madonna’s daughter Lourdes “Lola” Leon has been in the public eye since she was in the womb. So it’s no big surprise to see her tipped to be one of the big models in 2022. Following in the footsteps of Lennon Gallagher, Iris Law and Kaia Gerber, Lourdes – a trained dancer like her famous mother – has already appeared in campaigns for Swarovski, Mugler, Marc Jacobs and Jean Paul Gaultier. Her poses stand out in their precise choreography and her recent shoot for Paper magazine was on-point in its slinky Y2K stylings. However, Leon has been vocal about not piggybacking on Madonna’s fame (in fact she made headlines for her outspoken roasting of Madonna fans when they flooded her Instagram with geeky comments). The 24-year-old, who first graced the catwalk in 2018, told Vogue “people think I’m this talentless rich kid who’s had everything given to her, but I’m not.” She also believes in the importance of standing out from the crowd, or, in the case of TikTok, the algorithm. “I don’t know if it can go back now because of what social media has done to fashion, but I think that’s what it needs: [to be] based on the individual and how they choose to dress and live their lives,” she told Paper magazine. How very 2022. Steven Stokey-Daley Despite the pandemic, a flurry of new British designers have found exposure through social media and celebrity endorsements. Since graduating, Liverpudlian Steven Stokey-Daley, who operates under the business name SS Daley, gained exposure by dressing Harry Styles for his Golden music video. His oversize, billowy shirt and hand-embroidered trousers were showcased on Styles, causing the clothes to sell out immediately. Trained at the University of Westminster, Stokey-Daley once described his work as “micro-subversions”. As well as disrupting menswear through his feminine clothes, there’s a modernity to his sustainable, made-to-order business model too. His underlying aesthetic obsession (the British class system viewed through working-class eyes) remains of perennial interest. Consciously uncoupling from the fashion system (he says he was never into fashion as a youngster; “It’s bullshit,” he said), instead he draws from British culture for inspiration: a mood board he shared with Dazed magazine featured Kate Bush, Princess Diana and old Etonite schoolboys. Saul Nash Virgil Abloh’s death underlined the importance of what the late designer did to streetwear: transforming it into luxury garments and forcing a discussion about cultural expectations and dress codes, in the process. The next generation of designers have weaved Abloh’s philosophy around athleisure into their collections, and none more effectively than Saul Nash. He is a Fashion East (Marine Rose, Dior’ Kim Jones, Grace Wales Bonner) alumni, and Hypebeast magazine called him the “next superstar of sportswear”. Nash combines utility with Abloh’s architectural conceit, which drove all of his designs. During the pandemic, his digital presentations used choreography to express conversations around masculinity, sexuality and weaving in his cultural heritage (raised in London, he has Bajan and Guyanese heritage). This made his collections a talking point above and beyond the clothes. “My work is rooted in metamorphose,” he told Vogue, and we can’t wait to see what he comes up with next. Barry Glendenning and Suzanne Wrack Leah Williamson In many respects, every England woman football player will be a sporting face this year with a home Euros, which kick-off at Old Trafford and conclude at Wembley, likely to intensify the spotlight. For Williamson, though, this summer could be transformative. With more than 100 appearances for Arsenal, their youngest player to reach a century, the ball-playing centre back has been eased into the Lionesses squad and was primarily left on the bench during the 2019 World Cup despite a title-winning season with her club. Now, though, she is arguably no longer the future of the England back line but its present, with new manager Sarina Wiegman having handed her the captaincy for her first two camps in charge (both long-time captain Steph Houghton and Lucy Bronze are out with long-term injuries) as well as a starting berth. Scheduled to return from a hamstring injury in the new year, should the 24-year-old be fit enough she will likely get her first meaningful stab at a senior competitive international at the Euros and have the opportunity to really test the belief of Arsenal fans that she is one of the world’s best at the back by going up against some of the world’s finest forwards. SW Keely Hodgkinson Despite not having Olympic funding at the start of 2021, Hodgkinson wrapped up the year as the surprise leader of a new vanguard of British middle-distance female runners. It was an annus mirabilis for the teenager, who won the European Indoor 800 metres title just four days after her 19th birthday, becoming the youngest British winner of an indoor gold since 1970. It was her first tilt at a major title but even better was to come. A keen swimmer as a child until her father nudged her towards the track, Hodgkinson took Olympic silver at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games in a time of 1min 55.88sec. It was an improvement on that posted in victory by a 34-year-old Kelly Holmes in Athens six years before Hodgkinson was born. It made her the 26th fastest woman in history over two laps of the track. “That record has stood since ’95, is that right?” asked an incredulous Hodgkinson post-race. “And Kelly is a legend of the sport.” Hodgkinson is well on her way to achieving legendary status of her own, having finished the season with victory in the 800m Diamond League final. This year she will go for the track trinity of Commonwealth Games, and World and European Championships glory. BG Phil Foden Comfortably scaling the exalted heights many predicted even when he was a football-obsessed toddler, the so-called “Stockport Iniesta” already has three Premier League titles, an FA Cup and four League Cups to his name. While many pundits insisted the teenage Foden would have been better served spending time on loan away from Manchester City, the benefits of a daily training-ground education from his manager, Pep Guardiola, and the likes of skilled technicians such as David Silva, Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero are now apparent in a commendably patient and humble player who seems a model of high performance and low maintenance. During England’s run to the final of Euro 2020, Foden was used sparingly until a foot injury ruled him out of the final defeat by Italy, but Ahead of 2022’s winter World Cup in Qatar it seems inconceivable that he will not feature prominently in Gareth Southgate’s plans. “Phil can play in five positions up front,” said Guardiola, when asked about the 21-year-old’s strengths. “He can play in both attacking midfield positions in the pockets and he can play in three positions up front.” Southgate’s dilemma is not whether, but how best, to use a young man of his obscene talents. BG Ian Tucker Parag Agrawal Twitter’s new chief executive took over in November from co-founder Jack Dorsey and is already making changes to the organisation and the platform. Two senior executives have departed, and the company has been restructured with the aim of making it speedier to innovate. Observers and shareholders have long argued that the service needs to quickly grapple with some long-running fundamental problems: how to clamp down on misinformation and hate speech (without losing its rumbustious appeal); how to make some money (without bombarding users with ads); and how to attract younger users away from TikTok and Instagram (without alienating the older crowd). Last year, the company added an array of new features such as its subscription Twitter Blue service, paid Superfollows, Spaces live audio rooms and fact checking service Birdwatch. The jury is out on the success or otherwise of these innovations but the additions and iterations are likely to continue – a few days after Agrawal’s appointment, with an eye to revamping its messaging features, the company announced the acquisition of Slack-like app Quill. A different order of acquisition is predicted by one pundit, Scott Gallaway, who has suggested Salesforce should reheat its 2016 takeover attempt of Twitter, although last year he suggested that the platform should buy CNN – and that hasn’t happened YET. Last but not least, another item in Agrawal’s in-tray is Donald Trump’s legal challenge to his January 2021 permanent suspension from the platform. A bigly year is in store. Christel Schaldemose The limbering-up is over: this year legislators will be attempting to land a few punches on the tech heavyweights. In the US, Joe Biden’s new Federal Trade Commission head, Lina Khan, will be trying to curtail Silicon Valley mega-companies with her fresh interpretation of antitrust laws. And Europe has some Danish reinforcements in the form of Christel Schaldemose MEP. In recent years EU efforts have been led by the impressive European commissioner Margrethe Vestager yet her landmark data privacy laws are haphazardly enforced and competition cases have become bogged down in legalese. The EU’s answer is more rules – the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act – to regulate illegal content and improve competition respectively. Schaldemose has been tasked with shaping the former into something which will become law – which has involved wrangling 2,000 amendments. The act aims to crack down on everything from images of abuse to the sale of dangerous products online. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen says the legislation has the potential to be the “global gold standard”. The act should be put before legislators this month, and of course, will also require the agreement of the 27 states and the European Commission. How effective the act is will be determined by the interplay of Schaldemose’s horse-trading skills and the multimillion-dollar leverage of Silicon Valley lobbyists. As Schaldemose told Bloomberg, “We are taking a giant leap forward on regulating platforms, but we’re… not on the moon yet.” Anu Duggal In a recent round-up by Fast Company of 10 of this year’s rumoured tech IPOs – from online credit facilitator Klarna to gaming communication platform Discord – one factor was common to all: none had a female founder. Predictably, tech bros tend to invest in other tech bros. According to Dealroom in 2021, 90% of European venture capital went to male-only founded companies – a proportion unchanged in five years. But this year a new cohort of investors has the funds to initiate some change. The doyenne of this generation is Anu Duggal. In July her New York-based Female Founders Fund announced its third and biggest pot of money so far – $57m – partly financed by Melinda French Gates. Duggal said they hope to invest in 25 companies. “From day one, we have been committed to building the largest, most powerful network of female operators in technology,” she added. In November, a new German venture capital fund, Auxxo, announced it had $15m to invest in companies where at least 20% of the founding shares are held by women. And in the UK, this year Pink Salt Ventures will begin its second round of funding female-led start-ups. Wendy Ide and Barbara Ellen Suzanna Son Wholesomely freckle-faced, with guileless blue eyes, surrounded by novelty doughnuts: Suzanna Son makes an instant impression in Red Rocket, the latest film from Sean Baker (The Florida Project). Mikey, the down-on-his-luck adult movie actor who is the film’s central character, is immediately beguiled. And so is the audience. Son, who makes her acting debut in the film released in March , owes her career to that electrifying first impression – she was spotted by Baker on the street in Los Angeles. He told her he liked her look, but at the time nothing more came of the encounter. Then two years later, he invited her to audition for a low-budget movie following the comic misadventures of a narcissist ex-porn star, which was to be shot under the radar in Texas during the pandemic. She jumped at the chance. Son plays Strawberry, a coquettish highschooler who is bowled over by Mikey’s perma-tanned charm offensive. It’s a terrific performance: sparky, fresh and unaffected. In a film which doesn’t skew towards a particularly flattering view of human nature, she effortlessly captures the sympathy of the audience. She also sings, delivering a memorable rendition of N Sync’s Bye Bye Bye in a key scene. Next up for Son is another role which taps into her musical talent: she is starring in The Idol, a new HBO series set in the music industry which is currently filming. Baker, who praised her “dead-on” instincts, predicts a career path which could mirror that of Oscar-winner Emma Stone. WI Reda Elazouar All three of the central performances in Reggie Yates’s joyous directorial debut Pirates are terrific, but the stand out, in this energetic portrait of young male friendship and London at the turn of the millennium, is Reda Elazouar. With crisp comic timing and infectious humour, he steals every scene. WI Mike Faist Although Tony-award nominated for his Broadway theatre work, Faist was not a familiar face for cinema audiences. The live-wire volatility of his performance as Riff in Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story is set to change that. WI Gabrielle Creevy Welsh actor Gabrielle Creevy, 25, is one to watch in 2022. She burned bright in 2021, playing working-class lesbian teenager Bethan in the second series of semi-autobiographical BBC dramedy In My Skin, written by Kayleigh Llewellyn. In this study of love, dysfunction and survival – Bethan’s mother (Jo Hartley) suffers bipolar disorder, while her father (Rhodri Meilir) is a brutal alcoholic – Creevy brings Bethan to defiant, vulnerable life as she navigates school, family and her sexuality. Raised in a council flat in Port Talbot, Creevy won a Bafta Cymru award in 2019 for In My Skin, returning to her shift in a coffee shop after hearing she’d been nominated. With roles including The Pact (BBC One), she’s set to feature in John Madden’s upcoming war drama Operation Mincemeat alongside Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen. Creevy has also been cast as Maggie in the US television adaptation of Lisa Taddeo’s non-fiction bestseller, Three Women. BE Tahar Rahim Tahar Rahim, 40, a French actor of Algerian heritage, was subtly petrifying in 2021’s BBC One drama series The Serpent as real-life serial killer Charles Sobhraj, who duped, drugged, and murdered western travellers on the 1970s hippy trail. Rahim embodied the stylised menace and thin-skinned resentment of Sobhraj, turning The Serpent into one of the most compulsive and unsettling cult-watches of 2021. A character actor par excellence, Rahim’s career is ripening into one of chameleon-like versatility and uncompromising intensity. He won two Cesar awards for his breakthrough role in Jacques Audiard’s A Prophet (2009), and he’s been Golden Globe and Bafta-nominated for Kevin Macdonald’s 2021 Guantanamo Bay drama The Mauritanian. In 2022, Rahim will appear in Apple TV+’s climate change anthology drama Extrapolations, directed by Scott Z Burns, co-starring Meryl Streep, Marion Cotillard, and Ed Norton.
