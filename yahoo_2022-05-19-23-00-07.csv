5/19/2022,"By Neil Jerome Morales and Karen Lema MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines president-elect Ferdinand Marcos Jr on Wednesday said his country's ties with China will expand and ""shift to a higher gear"" when he takes power, signalling intent to advance outgoing leader Rodrigo Duterte's pro-Beijing agenda. Marcos, who won last week's election by a landslide, said he held ""very substantial"" talks by phone on Wednesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who assured him of support for his ""independent foreign policy"", and agreed to hold more comprehensive discussions. The 64-year-old son and namesake of the notorious former dictator said Xi also acknowledged his late father's role in opening diplomatic relations between China and former U.S. colony the Philippines. ""The way forward is to expand our relationship not only diplomatic, not only trade, but also in culture, even in education, even in knowledge, even in health, to address whatever minor disagreements that we have right now,"" Marcos said in a statement. ""I told him, we must not allow what conflicts or difficulties we have now between our two countries to become historically important."" The Philippines and China have had a rocky relationship in recent years over Beijing's vast territorial claims and conduct of its coast guard and fishing fleet in the South China Sea, through which at least $3.4 trillion of annual trade passes. Many analysts expect Marcos to seek stronger ties with Beijing, but say maintaining close relations with defence ally Washington will be essential in keeping the military and the public onside in a country with historically strong links to the United States. Their phone conversation focused on bilateral ties and regional development, the Chinese embassy in Manila said in a separate statement. Xi said both countries should carry forward their friendship, grasp the general trend and follow through the blueprint for bilateral friendly cooperation, the embassy added. Marcos won the presidency with nearly 59% of the votes last week. He will take office late in June. China was among the first to congratulate Marcos, who was the first win a presidential election by an outright majority since a 1986 revolution that toppled his late father's two-decade dictatorship. Kurt Campbell, the White House coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, last week said the United States would seek early engagement with the Marcos administration, but said there were ""historical considerations"" that could pose challenges. Marcos said Xi had expressed a desire to talking privately. ""We are both looking forward to having further dialogue,"" Marcos said. ""He said both of us should talk, without the others.""

5/19/2022,"A former choir teacher of a local high school is facing criminal charges after court documents say she had an inappropriate relationship with a student. According to a press release from the New Wilmington Police Department, an investigation into 26-year-old Olivia Lois Ortz began after the principal of the Wilmington Area High School received a call from Ortz’s husband, reporting the alleged relationship. As a mandated reporter, the principal reported the allegation to the police. Police say they held interviews with the 17-year-old student involved in the incident, who told officers that they considered Ortz to be a safe adult whom they trusted and confided in. The student also said the relationship allegedly turned into a romantic one that resulted in sexual activity. Officers say that Ortz communicated with the student outside of school verbally, via cellphone and through text-based messaging. Documents say that the student allegedly came to Ortz’s residence after she invited them over while her husband was away on a trip. Officers also say that the student returned to the house at Ortz’s invitation on multiple occasions to comfort her after her husband had discovered their secret relationship. Officers served a search warrant on May 5 and confiscated Ortz’s cell phone and iPad. They believe that the student and teacher began communicating over Spotify after the confiscation and that code words were established to indicate if the continued communication had been discovered. Over 100 messages were sent over Spotify from May 10-11 until the student’s father confiscated their cellphone. Ortz surrendered to police on May 16 and was committed to the Lawrence County Jail. Her bond was set at $150,000. Her preliminary hearing is set for May 25.

5/19/2022,"The aftershocks of Tuesday’s big primaries are still rumbling across Pennsylvania, but one impact is already clear: Republican voters’ choice of Doug Mastriano in the governor’s race is giving the GOP fits. Conversations with Republican strategists, donors and lobbyists in and outside of Pennsylvania in recent days reveal a party seething with anxiety, dissension and score-settling over Mastriano’s nomination. In the run-up to Tuesday night, Republicans openly used words and phrases such as “suicide mission,” “disaster” and “voyage of the Titanic” to convey just what a catastrophe they believed his candidacy will be for their party. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times An adviser to several Republican governors, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said there was wide displeasure with the outcome, calling him unelectable. The Mastriano campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Some in Pennsylvania blame Jeff Yass, a billionaire options trader and the state’s most powerful donor, for sticking with Bill McSwain for governor despite former President Donald Trump’s blistering anti-endorsement. Others point the finger at Lawrence Tabas, the state party chair, for failing to clear the field. Still others say Trump should have stayed out of the race altogether instead of endorsing Mastriano. Tabas did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. An eleventh-hour effort to stop Mastriano failed when both McSwain and Dave White, a self-funding candidate who spent at least $5 million of his own money, refused to drop out and support former Rep. Lou Barletta, whose supporters insisted he was the more viable option. Many Republicans thought that idea was futile and far too late. Several said a serious effort to prevent Mastriano from winning should have begun last summer, while others said Yass and his allies could have dropped McSwain sooner. “Had they kept their powder dry, they could have seen the lay of the land, when Mastriano’s lead was 8-10, and backed Barletta,” said Sam Katz, a former Republican candidate for governor who now backs Josh Shapiro, the Democratic nominee. “Had they spent $5 million in three weeks, they might have forced Trump to make a different choice and changed everything,” Katz said. Mastriano had amassed 44% of the vote as of Thursday morning. Matthew Brouillette, head of Commonwealth Partners, which bankrolled McSwain’s campaign, noted that his organization also backed Carrie DelRosso, who won the lieutenant governor’s race. He said the criticism was coming largely from “consultants and rent-seekers who don’t like us as we disrupt their gravy trains.” Ties to Jan. 6 and QAnon Mastriano’s vulnerabilities are legion, GOP operatives lament. The state senator and retired U.S. Army colonel has taken a hard line on abortion, which he has said should be illegal under all circumstances. He organized buses to Washington for the Jan. 6, 2021, rally in Washington and can be seen on video crossing police lines at the Capitol as the rally became a riot. He has also been a leading advocate of the baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. Mastriano’s name has appeared in documents released by the committee investigating the Capitol riot, and he claims to have been in close personal contact with Trump about their shared drive to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory. In February, the committee demanded “documents and information that are relevant to the select committee’s investigation” in a letter to Mastriano. He has refused to say whom he would appoint as secretary of state, a critical position overseeing election infrastructure and voting. Mastriano has appeared at events linked to QAnon, the amorphous conspiracy theory that alleges there is a secret cabal of elite pedophiles running the federal government and other major U.S. institutions. He also has made statements that veer into Islamophobia. He is likely to be an especially weak candidate in the crowded suburbs around Philadelphia, the state’s most important political battleground. On the other side of the state, the editorial page of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has already all but officially endorsed Shapiro as “the only statewide candidate who did everything the Pennsylvania way.” Operatives in both parties expect Shapiro to blitz Mastriano with advertising portraying him as a dangerous extremist while Mastriano’s shoestring organization struggles to raise money. Even before Mastriano clinched the nomination, Shapiro’s campaign aired an ad highlighting his views on abortion and the 2020 election as well as his ties to Trump, who lost the state to Biden by 80,000 votes. Mastriano gave scant indication during Tuesday’s victory speech that he was ready to shift toward a more palatable general election message. Listing his early priorities as governor, he said, “mandates are gone,” “any jab for job requirements are gone,” critical race theory is “over,” “only biological females can play on biological female teams” and “you can only use the bathroom that your biological anatomy says.” The Mastriano matchup also plays to Shapiro’s carefully cultivated image as a fighter for democracy, though his campaign plans to focus primarily on bread-and-butter economic issues such as jobs, taxes and inflation. As attorney general, Shapiro was directly involved in the Pennsylvania government’s litigation after the 2020 election, and oversaw at least 40 cases of alleged voter fraud — winning every single one. Wait-and-see mode Will national Republicans help Mastriano or shun him? The major players in governor’s races appear to be waiting to see how the race develops before making that determination. Some Republicans believe the national tail winds blowing in their favor might help Mastriano win despite all of his weaknesses, but for now, Democrats are thrilled to be facing him in November. They note that Shapiro performed better than Biden did in Pennsylvania during his reelection race as state attorney general, and expect Shapiro to be flooded with donations from in and outside the state. On Tuesday night, the Republican Governors Association issued a lukewarm statement acknowledging Mastriano’s victory, but suggesting he was on his own for now. “Republican voters in Pennsylvania have chosen Doug Mastriano as their nominee for governor,” Executive Director Dave Rexrode said. “The RGA remains committed to engaging in competitive gubernatorial contests where our support can have an impact.” The statement left room for the possibility that the GOP governors might help Mastriano should the Pennsylvania race be close in the fall. “We make those decisions based on where we think we can be effective,” Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, co-chairman of the governors’ group, said on CNN on Sunday. “Our policy has long been we get involved in races where we think we can win. So, that candidate, whoever gets elected in Pennsylvania, will have to show that they’re going to make it a good race.” © 2022 The New York Times Company",Politics/The New York Times,Republican Panic Grows After Mastriano Wins,https://news.yahoo.com/republican-panic-grows-mastriano-wins-124713550.html
5/19/2022,"By Max Hunder and Tom Balmforth KYIV (Reuters) -A 21-year-old Russian soldier asked a Ukrainian widow to forgive him for the murder of her husband, as a court in Kyiv met for a second hearing on Thursday in the first war crimes trial arising from Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. Vadim Shishimarin, a tank commander, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian, Oleksandr Shelipov, in the northeast Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on Feb. 28. ""I acknowledge my blame ... I ask you to forgive me,"" he told the widow, Kateryna Shelipova, at the hearing on Thursday attended by Reuters. Boyish, dressed in a tracksuit and with his shaven head lowered, Shishimarin cut a forlorn spectacle in a glass booth for defendants. He spoke calmly, but looked frightened. The Kremlin has said it has no information about the trial and that the absence of a diplomatic mission in Ukraine limits its ability to provide legal assistance. The widow told the court she had heard distant shots fired from their yard and that she had called out to her husband the day he was killed. ""I ran over to my husband, he was already dead. Shot in the head. I screamed, I screamed so much,"" she said, speaking in her rural accent. She looked distraught and her voice trembled with emotion. Shelipova told the court she would not object if Shishimarin was released to Russia as part of a prisoner swap to get ""our boys"" out of the port city of Mariupol, a reference to hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers who have given themselves up to Russia. The trial takes place as much of Ukraine is gripped by the fate of its soldiers that it hopes Russia will hand over as part of an exchange. Some Russian voices are calling for them to be put on trial for crimes. Shelipova said her husband had been unarmed and was dressed in civilian clothes. They had a 27-year-old son and two grandchildren together, she added. Ukraine has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civilians during the invasion and said it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia has denied targeting civilians or involvement in war crimes. Shishimarin is accused of firing several shots with an assault rifle at a civilian's head from a car after being ordered to do so. Asked if he had been obliged to follow an order that amounted to a war crime, Shishimarin said ""no"". ""I fired a short burst, three or four bullets,"" he told the court. ""I am from Irkutsk Oblast (a region in Siberia), I have two brothers and two sisters ... I am the eldest,"" he said. Shishimarin could face up to life imprisonment if convicted.

5/19/2022,"Nine Republicans voted against a bill that would help poor families buy baby formula. The bill is a measure that expands on a federal program to help low-income women and children. Separately, 192 Republicans voted no on a bill to staff up the FDA to help manage formula supply. Nine Republicans voted against a bill in Congress that would help lower-income women secure baby formula for their children. Many Republicans crossed party lines to vote for HR 7791, the Access to Baby Formula Act, which passed the House on Wednesday with 414 ""yes"" votes. However, the bill — which comes amid a crisis where parents are struggling to procure baby formula for their children — was voted down by nine Republican lawmakers. The ""no"" votes were cast by GOP Reps. Andy Biggs, Lauren Boebert, Thomas Massie, Clay Higgins, Matt Gaetz, Chip Roy, Paul Gosar, Louie Gohmert, and Marjorie Taylor Greene. The bill now goes to a vote in the Senate. Rep. Jahana Hayes introduced HR 7791 by saying it would help families using benefits under the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program access more baby formula. This supplemental nutrition program for poorer women does limit the kinds of baby formula brands that WIC recipients can purchase, though the bill aims to resolve these limits. The bill also requires that formula manufacturers put in place contingencies to prevent supply disruptions. ""I have heard directly from constituents who are searching for formula to no avail, and we are actively seeing the consequences of an essential service throttled by a monopoly industry during a time of unprecedented supply chain challenges,"" Hayes said in a press release. Rep. Rosa DeLauro introduced a second bill that was voted on in the same session, meant to address the ongoing baby formula crisis in the form of increased funding for the Food and Drug Administration. HR 7790 proposed a $28 million cash infusion to help the FDA address the current formula shortage and prevent future supply chain issues. DeLauro told NBC before the vote that most of the cash in her legislation would go to staffing up the FDA and bolstering its inspection force. According to The Hill, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise urged Republican members to vote no on HR 7790, arguing that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was pushing the bill forward ""in hopes of covering up the administration's ineptitude by throwing additional money at the FDA with no plan to actually fix the problem, all while failing to hold the FDA accountable."" The House vote on both bills came several hours after President Joe Biden invoked the Defense Production Act, using the 1950 law to boost the supply of formula from US manufacturers. The US is still facing staggering issues with baby formula supplies, with the backlog having been induced by pandemic supply chain snags and a recent recall of Abbott products. Brands including Target, Walgreens, and CVS have begun rationing purchase quantities, and nationwide shortages continue to plague parents.   Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,Here are the 9 Republicans who voted against a bill to help poor families buy baby formula amid the ongoing shortage,https://news.yahoo.com/9-republicans-voted-against-bill-065128243.html
5/19/2022,"CHICAGO (AP) — A Chicago mother has been charged with child endangerment after a gun in her second grader's backpack accidentally discharged at school, injuring a 7-year-old classmate, police said Wednesday. The 28-year-old woman appeared in court on Wednesday on three misdemeanor child endangerment counts. A judge ordered her release from Cook County Jail on $1,000 bond. During the hearing, prosecutors alleged that the woman's 8-year-old son found the gun underneath her bed and took it to Walt Disney Magnet School on the city’s North Side on Tuesday. The mother has a valid firearm owners identification card. According to police, the backpack was in the boy's classroom when, just before 10 a.m. on Tuesday, the gun discharged. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that prosecutors said during the hearing that the bullet ricocheted off the floor and grazed the child's abdomen. The child was taken to a hospital in good condition, police said. In an email to parents, the school's principal said the bullet ""caused some debris to ricochet in your child’s classroom, which hit a member of our school community and caused minor scrapes.” The school did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. A teacher then grabbed the backpack and gave it to security officers who found a Glock 19 handgun inside, prosecutors said during the hearing. The woman's attorney, Rodger Clarke, acknowledged that the gun should have been locked up and not just placed under the bed. But, he said, “This wasn't something she planned or something she did on her own volition.” Cook County Judge Michael Hogan was not impressed by that argument. “This may not have been an intentional act, but it is a supremely negligent act,” he said. He continued: “We are inches away, possibly centimeters away, from a very different case and a very different tragedy.”",U.S./Associated Press,"Gun in 8-year-old's backpack goes off at school, mom charged",https://news.yahoo.com/woman-charged-gun-sons-backpack-154537361.html
