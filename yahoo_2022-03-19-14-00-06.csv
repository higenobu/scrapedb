3/19/2022,"Russia's former foreign minister has dismissed the chances of nuclear war, declaring the prospect an ""empty threat"" from Vladimir Putin. Andrei Kozyrev, who served under Putin's predecessor Boris Yeltsin, also suggested the Putin era will soon end in ""disaster"" amid the Ukraine crisis. Putin ramped up his aggression three weeks ago when he put Russia's nuclear forces on high alert following the West's so-called ""unfriendly"" response following his invasion. At the very least, it raised the prospect that he was considering the use of a nuclear weapon, though experts dismissed this as rhetoric. And Kozyrev, speaking to The Economic Asks podcast, said he agreed. ""No it's just a blackmail,"" he said of the nuclear threat. Russia is believed to have 4,477 nuclear warheads. It is one of nine countries which has nuclear weapon capacities. Of the other eight, three are Nato allies - the US, France and the UK - among which there are 5,943 nuclear warheads. Kozyrev continued: ""Those forces which he allegedly ordered... sources are openly saying they don't see anything like that. It's an empty threat but he plays this game. Watch: Russia making ‘no real progress’ - UK government Armed Forces Minister James Heappey has said Russia's invasion of Ukraine is making slow progress but that the latest missile strike in western Ukraine was a cause for concern. ""Those strategic weapons that he ordered on alert [are] suicidal weapons because if he sends a missile to Europe, Nato or the United States, he gets two back and there is no survival for anyone."" Asked how Putin's dictatorship ends, Kozyrev stated: ""In disaster. It's already disaster but he just does not realise that."" He added a coup is possible, saying it is ""very much in Russian tradition"".

For example, it has been reported 230 Russian tanks have been lost in the war, which if correct would be the highest experienced by an army since the Second World War. More pertinently, his war has caused a humanitarian disaster, with hundreds of civilian deaths and millions of people displaced from their homes.

3/19/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said on Thursday that giving Ukraine air defence systems, as requested by Ukraine's president in the U.S. Congress a day earlier, would be a destabilising factor that would not bring peace to the country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged American lawmakers on Wednesday to do more to protect his country from Russia's invasion, pushing for the imposition of a no-fly zone and asking for aircraft and defensive systems. ""Such deliveries ... would be a destabilising factor which will definitely not bring peace to Ukraine,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a news briefing. ""In the long term, they could have much more dangerous consequences,"" she added. The United States and its allies want to avoid NATO being drawn into the Ukraine conflict, but they have supplied Kyiv with military aid since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Moscow calls its offensive in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. Slovakia's Prime Minister Eduard Heger on Sunday said NATO could discuss sending his country's Soviet-made S-300 air defence system to Ukraine.
