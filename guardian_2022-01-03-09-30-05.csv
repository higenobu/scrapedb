1/3/2022,"The Unite union is demanding the government sets clear targets for the use of UK-produced steel in the HS2 rail project, after it emerged that the Department for Transport currently has none in place. Responding to two written questions in parliament posted by Labour MPs in December, the transport minister Andrew Stephenson admitted there is “no formal target” for the use of UK steel in its construction.  Despite cuts to the original plan, HS2 is still a major part of the UK’s £96bn integrated rail plan and will be the largest building project in Europe, requiring millions of tonnes of steel to build the tracks, stations and tunnels. Unite said the UK’s exit from the European Union should have made it easier for the government to ensure that British products were used in infrastructure projects. More than 33,000 people are employed in 1,100 steel businesses across the UK. Questions over HS2’s sourcing came in October after it emerged that the French firm Sendin had supplied the project with more than 2,000 tonnes of steel. At the time HS2 said its contractor had approached all suitable alternative UK suppliers, but none could provide the necessary product in time. HS2 said 97% of all businesses the project has worked with throughout its supply chains were British. “The government must immediately develop clear targets on UK steel usage on publicly funded construction projects,” said the Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham. “In the case of HS2, UK producers should have a paramount place in producing steel for the project. Surely that is economic common sense? This failure of the government’s procurement policies will be challenged by my union. You could not make it up,” Graham said. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “HS2 is a once in a generation investment in the UK’s transport infrastructure and we expect it to have a lasting impact on jobs, skills and businesses here in the UK. “The government and HS2 Ltd have engaged extensively with the British steel industry over the last five years to ensure that it is in the best possible position to compete for contracts.” Last week, the Guardian revealed that the UK steel industry was braced for an immediate slump in trade after the EU and the US reached an agreement to remove tariffs on a quota of steel and aluminium imported from the bloc to the US from 1 January. Tariffs will remain on all UK steel and aluminium exports after the UK government talks failed to secure a matching breakthrough.",News/UK news,Unite demands clear targets for use of UK steel in HS2 project,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/unite-demands-clear-targets-for-use-of-uk-steel-in-hs2-project
1/3/2022,"A motorist was caught driving while distracted nine times in the past four years, new figures reveal, with road safety campaigners calling for repeat offenders to have their licences revoked. The person, who has not been identified, was among 932 British drivers convicted for the offence more than once over that period. Twenty-seven drivers were caught between three and five times, 904 were caught twice and 90,057 were caught once, according to the figures obtained by the PA Media news agency.  The statistics, released by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in response to a freedom of information request, are a snapshot of the number of CU80 offences on driving records on 13 November. A CU80 offence is defined as a “breach of requirements as to control of the vehicle, such as using a mobile phone”, comes with three to six penalty points and must stay on a driving record for four years from the date of the offence. Jason Wakeford, the head of campaigns at road safety charity Brake, said: “It’s alarming to see repeat offenders, who have had ample opportunity to change their behaviour, still on the roads and putting other people at risk. “We believe that drivers who regularly disregard the law should have their licences revoked. This would help save lives, prevent needless injuries, and send a clear signal that driving is a privilege and not a right.” The RAC road safety spokesperson Simon Williams said: “Sadly, these figures demonstrate that far too many drivers are still breaking the law and putting others on the road needlessly at risk. Worryingly, the RAC’s research shows that a quarter of drivers are still making or receiving calls with a handheld phone while driving, and incredibly a small but sizeable proportion even admit to filming videos or playing games at the wheel.” If a driver accrues 12 or more points within three years, they can be disqualified. But courts have discretion to allow offenders to keep driving if they are able to prove extenuating circumstances, including when a ban would cause extreme financial hardship. The DVLA said just 506 of the 90,989 motorists with the CU80 endorsements on their record were disqualified as a result. It has not been revealed whether the person with nine CU80s was among those banned. Under current UK laws, drivers are banned from texting or making a phone call with a handheld device, other than in an emergency. Tougher rules prohibiting people from taking photos or videos, scrolling through playlists or playing games on their phones when driving will be introduced this year.",News/World news,UK motorist caught driving while distracted nine times in four years,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/uk-motorist-caught-driving-while-distracted-nine-times-in-four-years
1/3/2022,"Tens of thousands of vaccine volunteers have been praised for giving up about two million hours of their time to help with the rollout of Covid jabs throughout 2021. A woman who translated crucial health messages into Punjabi to reach more communities is among more than 100,000 people who donated their time to the vaccine effort in the past year.  More than 132m coronavirus jabs were given last year in the largest vaccine campaign in British history. More than 90% of people in the UK over the age of 12 have now had their first dose of a Covid-19 jab and 82.4% have had their second. After the emergence of the Omicron variant triggered an acceleration of the rollout over the festive season, more than 1.6 million people received their booster dose in the final week of 2021, bringing the total number of boosted adults in the UK to nearly 34 million, including three in four eligible adults in England. NHS England said volunteers working alongside healthcare staff had particularly helped during the ramped-up supply of jabs and boosters in December. The health service launched a recruitment drive to speed up the distribution of jabs and so far 17,500 people have registered their interest in paid vaccination roles, NHS England said. A further 48,000 people have registered as steward volunteers through the NHS Volunteer Responders programme in just over a month, of which more than 10,000 have already deployed. Working alongside the NHS, St John Ambulance has seen 17,000 people come forward to do shifts as volunteer vaccinators. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said the success of the vaccination programme was “astounding and a true reflection of the fantastic work of our NHS and its volunteers. I want to thank each and every one of them”. NHS England’s chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, said the efforts of volunteers would “undoubtedly help to save many more lives”. She said: “Alongside NHS staff, our selfless volunteers have worked tirelessly to protect the nation – in football stadiums, shopping centres, Christmas markets and countless other vaccination sites up and down the country. “I want to give my personal thanks to everyone who has given up their time to help us beat record after record – continuing to make the NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme the biggest and most successful in health service history.” Boris Johnson set the target of offering all eligible adults the chance to get their booster jabs by the end of January, but after the emergence of Omicron he brought forward the deadline to the new year. Millions of people queued at about 3,000 vaccination centres, and on 18 December NHS England administered a record 830,000 jabs in a single day. Jaz Kaur Bangerh, from Leeds, has been promoting messages about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in ethnic minority communities, including translating information into Punjabi. “Volunteering for the vaccination programme, I have helped people to fill in forms, guided them to the right place and answered any questions, especially if they were a bit anxious in the early days, when there was a lot of information out there.” John Hardman, who has volunteered at jab sites in the capital including Wembley stadium and the Science Museum, said he “can’t recommend it [volunteering] enough”. “There are lots of opportunities to support locally, even if just for a few sessions.” NHS England said people interested in getting involved can search NHS vaccine team online.",News/World news,Volunteers praised for huge role in giving UK public Covid jabs,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/volunteers-praised-for-huge-role-in-giving-uk-public-covid-jabs
