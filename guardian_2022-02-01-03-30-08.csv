2/1/2022,"Portugal’s ruling Socialists are preparing for a third consecutive term after winning a surprise absolute majority in a snap general election that confounded predictions, pundits and pollsters and saw the far-right become the third-largest group in parliament. The prime minister, António Costa, has pledged to use his unexpectedly large mandate to bring in reforms and investments that will make Portugal “more prosperous, fairer, and more innovative”.  Among the new government’s key priorities will be passing a new budget for 2022 to begin using €45bn in EU Covid recovery funds. Squabbles over Costa’s draft budget at the end of last year triggered Sunday’s general election after the Socialists’ former allies in the Communist party and the Left Bloc joined rightwing parties in rejecting the budget bill after weeks of negotiations. But Costa’s landslide victory means his party no longer has to depend on the partners that made up the so-called geringonça, or improvised solution, that defined his first two terms. “Freed from the shackles of the radical left, the Socialists and António Costa can now implement more moderate and Europe-focused solutions,” the newspaper Publico said in an editorial on Monday. The comparatively rare triumph of European social democracy was hailed by Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, who heads a Socialist-led coalition government across the border. “Portugal has once again backed a social democratic project that combines growth and social justice,” Sánchez said in a congratulatory tweet. Costa’s victory was also welcomed by many left-leaning voters. At a bus stop in Âlcantara, a waterfront neighbourhood in west Lisbon, a 69-year-old voter called Olivia said she hoped the result would bring stability and social progress. “I didn’t expect that the Socialist party would get the majority, but I hope it can be a solution for governing for four more years without disruption,” she said. Olivia added that many far-left voters had decided to back the Socialists to prevent the formation of a minority government of the centre-right Social Democrats (PSD) that would cut deals with the far-right Chega party. The populist, anti-Roma party saw its seat count surge from one to 12 on Sunday night. “It was sad to see many parties lose strength – and to have the far-right as the third party in parliament,” she said. In a fractured political landscape, and after weeks of polls suggesting a tight race between the Socialists and the centre-right Social Democrats (PSD), much of the electorate hadn’t even contemplated the prospect of either party winning an absolute majority. In the end, the Socialists won 41.7% of the vote and a 117 seats in the 230-seat parliament, while the PSD came second with 28% of the vote and 71 seats. Some were nervous at the prospect of a government with an absolute majority – something that has happened in only four elections since 1987. When the results came in late in Sunday night, Costa himself assured reporters that “a majority win is not absolute power; it doesn’t mean governing alone”. Carlos Madeira, who was sitting on a bench in a busy Lisbon street on Monday morning, confessed to mixed feelings. “I wanted the socialist party to win, but not with an absolute majority,” he said. “I think it’s too dangerous to leave it in one person’s hands.” Madeira, who became homeless two years ago after losing his job as a cook at a luxury hotel in the capital, thinks many voters – including himself – opted for the Socialists as a safe bet given their stewardship of the economy, reversal of painful post-crisis austerity measures and efficient Covid vaccination plan. He now hopes the new government will increase wages and lower taxes to boost employment. Meanwhile Chega’s leader, André Ventura, appears to be relishing a fight. “António Costa, I’m coming for you,” he told supporters after the vote. “From now on there won’t be a soft opposition. We’ll assume the role of the real opposition to the Socialists … and restore dignity to this country.” Although Chega’s share of the vote rose from 1.9% in the 2019 general election to 7.2% on Sunday, some wonder what the noisy and pugnacious party will do now that it has consolidated its parliamentary presence. Pedro Rovisco, a taxi driver who voted for the PSD, said: “Chega is the reflection of people being unhappy with the state of affairs, but they will never be in government – they don’t have that ability of course.” Carlos Vilela, 42, who works at a fruit market, offered a similar assessment of Ventura and Chega. “It’s all lies … his talk on immigrants being a burden, criticising those who live off benefits. I don’t even know what he will be doing in parliament.”",News/World news,António Costa pledges to make Portugal ‘fairer’ after surprise poll victory,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/antonio-costa-pledges-to-make-portugal-fairer-after-surprise-poll-victory
2/1/2022,"UK food producers and brewers have warned of shortages of meat, beer and fizzy drinks, as well as higher prices, after the government opted not to renew support for the carbon dioxide industry. Meat processors, brewers, bakers and soft drink producers all use CO2 in making and packaging their goods. It is also required for the humane slaughter of animals including pigs and chickens.  The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said last autumn it had brokered a deal between businesses in the CO2 sector, to ensure supplies of the gas to the food and drink industry, as well as hospitals and nuclear power plants. It came after the government was forced to use taxpayer money to fund a short-term bailout for CF Industries, which accounts for 60% of the UK’s CO2 supplies, to prop up the company and stave off supply chain chaos. CF Fertilisers, which is owned by a private firm in the US, had halted production at two of its plants, Billingham on Teesside and Ince in Cheshire, as a result of rocketing prices of gas required to power its operations. However, the three-month deal came to an end on 31 January, and BEIS said it was now up to the CO2 industry to work together. A spokesperson from the department said: “We welcome industry’s agreement in October to ensure CF Fertilisers on Teesside can continue to operate even during the current period of high global gas prices. It is for the CO2 industry to ensure supplies to UK businesses.” During the three-month deal, customers of CF Fertilisers had agreed to pay a set price for CO2 until at least the end of January. The deal was intended to give the industry time to develop alternative sources of food-grade CO2. The Guardian understands that while some extra production has become available – such as from anaerobic digestion at biomass plants – and there have been extra imports of the gas, this has been limited and food industry remains concerned over the reliability of supply. CF Industries said on Monday that negotiations with its industrial gas customers over pricing agreements were continuing. Industry analysts said continued CO2 availability was reliant on a new deal between CF Industries and UK distributors of the gas, Nippon Gases and Air Liquide. On Friday, the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) sent a letter to the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and the environment secretary, George Eustice, outlining its worries about the impact of further CO2 shortages in the absence of a new industry deal. “It is critical that together we ensure supply can continue and that we build long-term resilience into the production of food-grade CO2,” said Kate Halliwell, the FDF’s chief scientific officer, as she called on ministers to work with industry. Halliwell said that without guaranteed supplies, “this could lead to shortages in the products we find on our supermarket shelves – adding further pressures to families already coping with high food-price inflation”. The British Meat Processors Association said its industry had been assured by government that animal welfare would be a priority, and that supplies to abattoirs would take precedence, along with those to the NHS and the nuclear sector. Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said the sector needed a long-term solution as it struggles to recover from repeated closures during the pandemic. “After a devastating winter period for our pubs and brewers, ongoing supply chain disruption could add to the burden of additional costs or seriously hinder our recovery as a sector,” she said.",News/Business,UK food and drink firms warn of shortages as ‘bailout’ of C02 industry ends,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/31/uk-food-and-drink-firms-warn-of-shortages-bailout-c02-industry-ends-meat-beer
2/1/2022,"George Monbiot makes important points about the role of nature-based solutions (Carbon offsetting is not warding off environmental collapse – it’s accelerating it, 26 January). We need to preserve our natural forests, mangroves, sea grasses and peatlands to slow current heating levels, and we need to restore and expand them to deal with our legacy carbon. But in suggesting that all offsetting is simply greenwashing, he does a disservice to the hundreds of community-based projects that are working to improve lives and conserve natural carbon sinks. The Association for Coastal Ecosystem Services helps people in Kenya protect their mangrove forests and use money from the sale of carbon credits for water, education and health. The forests, the money and the projects belong to them. We do not take money from fossil-fuel companies, but rather from individuals and small corporations that are committed to reducing emissions but still want to compensate for those that they cannot avoid.  This is ethical offsetting and it has an important role to play. Please don’t confuse this with the corporate greenwashing of big oil.Prof Mark HuxhamConvener, Association for Coastal Ecosystem Services  In pointing out the misuse of carbon offsetting by multinationals, George Monbiot only shows one side of the coin. In my 25 years of working to save CO2, I avoided offsets for two reasons: failed offsets, such as forests dying, and future offsets, eg claiming that a flight to New York today is offset by planting trees that take 50 years to absorb the same amount of CO2. But we need a way to fund the drawdown of excess CO2 in the atmosphere (estimated at up to a trillion tonnes). To do this, carbon sequestration activities need a rapid injection of cash, which offsetting can provide. Certification has dealt with offset failures and there are now genuine time-bound offsets available that only count CO2 absorbed in, say, the current year. Whether they pay to replace wood stoves with solar stoves in Africa or to finance British farmers to adopt low-carbon practices, offsets are essential to reach net zero. The question is not whether offsets are good or bad, but which ones are good.Mukti Kumar MitchellDirector, Carbon Savvy  For some time I have felt that there was something amiss about flying off to some distant land for a holiday and salving one’s conscience by paying a carbon offsetting charge. Thank you, George Monbiot, for making it clear why the climate catastrophe will not be solved this way. Planting a few more trees with one hand while destroying forests or drilling for more oil with the other does not pass muster. Those of us of mature years who have created the problem should be first to try to limit our carbon footprints.Barbara FosterWelwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire  Your report (26 January) that at least 100,000 ghost flights could be flown across Europe this winter makes for highly disturbing reading.

2/1/2022,"Peter Johnstone says the “Sam Vimes ‘Boots’ theory of socioeconomic unfairness” was not invented by Terry Pratchett but by Paul Jennings in the Observer in 1954 (Letters, 28 January). The same theory was in fact put forward much earlier – by the character Owen in The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists by Robert Tressell, published in 1914. Owen illustrates it with reference to buying stockings, boots, shoes and underclothes for his family. He says: “This is how the working classes are robbed. Although their incomes are the lowest, they are compelled to buy the most expensive articles – that is, the lowest-priced articles. Everybody knows that good clothes, boots or furniture are really the cheapest in the end, although they cost more money at first; but the working classes can seldom or never afford to buy good things; they have to buy cheap rubbish which is dear at any price.” If you want to know about capitalism and socialism, The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists is still a good guide.Sally GoldsmithSheffield   Neither Terry Pratchett nor Paul Jennings was first with this idea.

For looked-after children with siblings, keeping in regular contact is key, and is encouraged whenever possible.  This aspect of social work practice has come a long way since Ashley was a child.

2/1/2022,"It’s not the version of the report Sue Gray had intended to publish, but her 12-page “update” on more than a dozen Downing Street parties could be described as a damning masterpiece of succinct understatement. Written in the first person against a backdrop of intense anticipation, its language is in line with the work of a veteran civil servant with significant experience examining ethics breaches at government’s highest level.  At points, Gray’s frustration at being asked by Scotland Yard to hold back on what are thought to be the most damning details is apparent. “Unfortunately, this necessarily means that I am extremely limited in what I can say about those events and it is not possible at present to provide a meaningful report,” she writes. Saying she considered whether it would be better to pause her investigation, Gray adds: “Given the widespread public interest in, and concern about, these matters, and to avoid further delay, I am providing an update on the investigation.” The use of the word “update” is seen as a signal by Gray that she does not consider this the final word and expects to submit a full report after police investigations are complete. The Downing Street parties report was expected to be similar to two other investigations into ministers. In 2020 the standards chief Sir Alex Allan examined bullying allegations against Priti Patel, and three years earlier Gray examined allegations against Damien Green. The earlier Gray report led to Green’s sacking as first secretary of state after he admitted lying about pornographic images on his House of Commons computer. While the then cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, was unable to reach a definitive conclusion on separate allegations made by the writer and Tory activist Kate Maltby that Green had behaved improperly towards her, Gray’s finding that Maltby’s account was “plausible” was also highly significant. The word “plausible”, –which Gray is said to have insisted be included in her 2017 report, does not appear in her parties report, but she still manages to convey a damning verdict on some of the behaviour she investigated. “Against the backdrop of the pandemic, when the government was asking citizens to accept far-reaching restrictions on their lives, some of the behaviour surrounding these gatherings is difficult to justify,” she writes. As for the report on Patel, it was its author, Allan, who ended up resigning as Johnson’s ethics adviser after the prime minister refused to sack his home secretary despite the report finding evidence that she had bullied civil servants. Gray is unlikely to be going anywhere, even after taking on the altogether more difficult task of investigating not just her boss, the prime minister, but also Simon Case, the head of the civil service, who stepped down from leading the investigation. Those familiar with Gray are convinced she will not have been daunted. A succession of profiles has seldom failed to mention her time in the 1980s as a “no nonsense” landlady running a pub with her husband outside Newry during the Troubles. The stint was a career break from the civil service, which Gray had joined in the 1970s, before she was lured back to London to work at the Cabinet Office under Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. Higher-profile roles followed under David Cameron, before she was appointed as the director general of the propriety and ethics team in 2012. In Monday’s report, Gray makes her feelings clear about her role in the civil service when she talks in her conclusion about the “whole of the country” rising to the challenge of the pandemic. “Ministers, special advisers and the civil service, of which I am proud to be a part, were a key and dedicated part of that national effort,” she writes.",News/Politics,Gray ‘update’ on parties inquiry is a masterpiece of understatement,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/gray-update-on-parties-inquiry-is-a-masterpiece-of-understatement

2/1/2022,"During the first weeks of the new tennis season, the top players are usually at their most relaxed. As they step forward into the new year after quality time away from competition, they arrive in Australia before the toll of constant travel, countless matches and numerous frustrating losses leaves its mark.  But this was no normal Australian Open. The tournament began in the shadow of unprecedented drama as Novak Djokovic’s visa saga played out for nearly two weeks. His building was surrounded by human rights activists protesting for the thirty-plus refugees detained indefinitely, hundreds of Serbian-Australians and numerous anti-mandate protesters. After many long, dull court hearings expedited at the speed of light, it ended with Djokovic being deported from the country on the eve of the tournament. This had nothing to do with any of the other players, many of whom had not been vaccinated a few months ago but chose to do so in order to compete, yet the vibes across the Australian Open at the beginning of the tournament were off. Djokovic’s deportation loomed large, with players constantly peppered with questions about him. Naomi Osaka summed up the mood as she passed on giving an answer. “Is my opinion going to help anything?” she said. Yet what unfolded over the following two weeks is an affirmation of the sport itself and the moments of joy, levity and hope it brings. From the first rounds of a grand slam tournament when 256 men and women play for the titles, almost every round has the potential for someone to enjoy one of the best days of their life. One of the most poignant stories of the fortnight was Alizé Cornet’s long-awaited moment in the sun. While contesting her 60th consecutive grand slam tournament at 32 years old, Cornet finally reached a quarter-final. In one of the most joyous moments of her life, Cornet used it to shine a light on Jelena Dokic, the interviewer, applauding her strength for being a survivor of abuse. Her compatriot, Gaël Monfils, entered the press room at 1am on Wednesday morning after a tight quarter-final loss to Matteo Berrettini, yet as he talked with two English-speaking journalists he delivered one of he most emotional moments of the event by resolving to fight for the possibility of winning a grand slam title. “All the time in my career, I never made the good decision [on court],” he said. “I’m fine with that. I must say I’m very fine with that, but I believe I can click once. Before I finish, I believe that once I will do it. So, that’s my faith.” The Special Ks continued to rise as Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis won the men’s doubles title. Osaka bounced back, losing in the third round but tackling her career with a greater perspective that she hopes will carry her through the season. Carlos Alcaraz, the next great hope, ploughed on. Two 17 year-old trailblazers emerged in the the juniors, with Angella Okutoyi becoming the first Kenyan player to ever win a junior grand slam match as she reached the third round and Meshkat al-Zahra Safi becoming the first Iranian to win at a junior major. The tournament ended with a variety of lessons and ample perspective. Danielle Collins is only nine months on from a surgery to remove a tennis ball-sized cyst from her uterus due to her endometriosis, yet she marched all the way to the final, taking her chance with a performance of the highest quality. As she won and won, Collins was continually open about her health problems and, at times, the crippling effects they have had on her. Ash Barty had arrived in her home slam as the heavy favourite and in her third Australian Open as the world number one. With all of the pressure that can arise in front of a home crowd, Barty blocked the world out and picked apart her opponents one-by-one to take her first Australian Open title, delivering an all-time great sporting moment before a huge audience. Barty’s victory was watched by a record-breaking average national audience of 3.577 million and, a day later, the men’s final became an instant classic as Rafael Nadal and Daniil Medvedev did battle. Nadal had no reason to expect that he would still be present in the draw by this point in the tournament. Just reaching the final had already been enough for him to react with tears. His preparation for the tournament was a mess, yet his mental fortitude carried him through to one of the most astounding wins of his storied career. Despite the gloom at the beginning of the tournament, what unfolded at Melbourne Park was an extraordinary few weeks and there will probably never be anything like it again. It is a reminder that no player is bigger than the sport, but also that, despite its flaws, tennis has a knack of providing uplifting, human moments from the least celebrated players in the earliest rounds right until the end.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic drama eclipsed by Australian Open’s uplifting finale | Tumaini Carayol,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/31/novak-djokovic-drama-eclipsed-by-australian-opens-uplifting-finale
2/1/2022,"Boris Johnson has announced the appointment of a new Office of the Prime Minister after Sue Gray’s interim report into Downing Street parties called for a major overhaul of Downing Street and questioned the roles of two of his most senior civil servants. Fighting for his political survival in the Commons, Johnson also said he would introduce a new permanent secretary in Downing Street, and would review the civil service and special adviser codes of conduct.  “It is time to sort out what Sue Gray rightly calls the ‘fragmented and complicated’ leadership structures of Downing Street, which she says have not evolved sufficiently to meet the demands of the expansion of No 10, and we will do that, including by creating an Office of the Prime Minister with a permanent secretary to lead No 10,” he said. The Gray report criticised the leadership of the Cabinet Office, which is currently headed by Simon Case, the cabinet secretary and the UK’s most senior civil servant. “There were failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times,” it said. Downing Street staff felt unable to raise complaints about poor behaviour they had witnessed within No 10 and a new route for whistleblowers should be introduced, Gray’s report said. Johnson told MPs he would review the code “so that no one should feel unable to come forward with complaints they may have”. Martin Reynolds’ job as the prime minister’s principal private secretary is also expected to be radically changed, after Gray’s updated report found that he bore “too much responsibility and expectation” to run No 10. The abridged report released on Tuesday does not accuse any civil servants of wrongdoing by name, which has disappointed many of the government’s critics. Sources said that such information would be expected to be included if the full report is released after the conclusion of the Met police inquiry into 14 parties. Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said Gray could not name individual civil servants or politicians who had broken rules because of the impending criminal inquiry by the Met into a number of gatherings. “She can’t conclude whether the rules are broken because she would be prejudging the police inquiry, but she gets as close as she can to saying that these events broke the rules and by implication the PM misled parliament. “She is unable to be definitive in her criticisms of individuals because of the criminal inquiry.” Gray was clear early on in her report that she was not making a judgment on whether any crimes had been committed, saying this was “properly a matter for law enforcement”. As well as describing some of the behaviour during the gatherings as “difficult to justify”, she concludes that some of the gatherings themselves represented “a serious failure to observe … the standards expected of the entire British population at the time”. She also found that some gatherings “should not have been allowed to take place”, although whether this was because they were illegal or because they contravened official guidance is not spelled out. The report contains stinging criticism of the culture at No 10. Gray said: “The excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional workplace at any time.” The conclusion follows allegations of frequent excessive drinking by Downing Street staff to the extent where a wine fridge was bought and staff were dispatched to local supermarkets to fill a suitcase with wine. Any specific action taken against civil servants criticised in any report would be decided by their line managers and the Civil Service Commission. In the case of special advisers, it would be up to the prime minister to decide whether they should stay in post. Those who are not facing any form of disciplinary action but who have been present at illegal events could be offered alternative jobs across the civil service, Whitehall sources have said. The question of which details were to be published and when were complicated by Gray’s decision to refer some of the Downing Street parties to the police. On 25 January, it was announced that the Metropolitan police would investigate allegations of breaches of Covid regulations at “a number of events”. This suggests Gray felt there was sufficient evidence to suggest that some of the events broke Covid-related laws. The inquiry was established to investigate more than 16 different parties and drinks events across Downing Street and Whitehall, and sought to establish who organised and authorised them. Martin ReynoldsBoris Johnson’s principal private secretary, the most senior civil servant in his office, is widely believed to be at the centre of one of the most damning party allegations. He wrote an email inviting up to 100 Downing Street staff to a “bring your own booze” garden party on 20 May 2020. Johnson claimed that he thought this was a work event, but at least two senior aides are said to have warned him not to go because it was against the rules. Reynolds also reportedly attended other gatherings, including Johnson’s surprise birthday party in the Cabinet room in June 2020. Simon CaseThe 43-year-old was appointed in September 2020 by Johnson to be head of the civil service and cabinet secretary, the UK’s top mandarin. A former private secretary to Prince William, he is Sue Gray’s boss and was originally appointed by Johnson to run the inquiry into lockdown parties across Whitehall. He stood down from that role after it emerged that a Christmas quiz was held in his own private office. Dan RosenfieldJohnson’s chief of staff has been accused by many Tory MPs of allowing a culture at No 10 where staff believed it was acceptable to flout the lockdown rules. He took over as chief of staff in January 2021, and is understood to have been aware of, if not actually present at, a number of the gatherings.",News/Politics,Johnson creates Office of the Prime Minister after Sue Gray criticism,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/johnson-creates-office-of-the-prime-minister-after-sue-gray-criticism
2/1/2022,"The latest move in golf’s global power struggle will take place on Tuesday, when the Saudi Arabian business fronted by Greg Norman reveals detailed plans for 10 events – including one in the UK – on the 2022-23 Asian Tour schedule. The UK element of the new series will be perceived as openly hostile given relations between the Saudis and golf’s main tours.  Norman is due to hold a press conference at Royal Greens Golf & Country Club ahead of this week’s Saudi International, which is now sanctioned by the Asian Tour. The DP World and PGA Tours are strongly opposed to Saudi’s plans for the top level game – which they view as a commercial threat – meaning leading players may soon have a choice to make over whether to remain in the current ecosystem or accept vast sums to play within a rival organisation. Ultimately the Saudis have plans for a Super Golf League, comprising 14 events. Information seen by the Guardian shows that LIV Golf Investments, represented by Norman, a former world No 1, and funded by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, is expected to announce their newly-branded International Series, worth up to $2m per event plus inevitably lucrative appearance fees. Under the plan, March will see the first of the new tournaments take place in Thailand. The Centurion Club in Hertfordshire is expected to stage a competition in early June, immediately before the US Open. Other events will be staged in Korea, the Middle East, China and Hong Kong. Key, of course, is whether or not golfers will see the appeal in what is a congested schedule. The DP World and PGA Tours will not make it easy for their members to compete routinely on the Asian Tour, should such dispensation even be granted at all. Bryson DeChambeau, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Shane Lowry, Lee Westwood and Tommy Fleetwood are among those playing in the Saudi International from Thursday.

2/1/2022,"A Dutch publisher has apologised for a book that made headlines around the world by identifying a Jewish notary as the prime suspect for the betrayal of Anne Frank to the Nazis. Ambo Anthos has said that it had decided to suspend further prints of The Betrayal of Anne Frank until there was more work done on the book’s central claims.  In a statement, the publishing house said it now believed it had been carried away by “momentum” around publication of the book and that it should have take a more “critical” stance. HarperCollins, the US publisher which bought the English language rights to the book, were said by Ambo Anthos to have “determined the [book’s] content”. HarperCollins has been contacted for comment. The Betrayal of Anne Frank, by Canadian author Rosemary Sullivan, is based on six years of research gathered by a team led by retired FBI detective Vince Pankoke. The book was published on 18 January with some fanfare, including a CBS 60 Minutes programme. But within 24 hours of publication, historians and researchers had raised doubts about the central theory that Arnold van den Bergh, who died of throat cancer in 1950, had probably led the police to the Frank family’s hiding place above a canal-side warehouse in the Jordaan area of Amsterdam on 4 August 1944. Critics specifically questioned the evidence behind the claim that as a member of the Jewish council in Amsterdam, an administrative body the German authorities forced Jews to establish, Van den Bergh would probably have had access to the places in which Jewish people were hiding. Pieter van Twisk, who was part of the investigating team behind the book, said the claims made in the book had been appropriately caveated and that he was perplexed by the publisher’s statement. The book, a result of a six-year investigation, suggests that Van den Bergh, who acted as notary in the forced sale of works of art to prominent Nazis such as Hermann Göring, had been forced by risks to his own life to use addresses of hiding places as a form of life insurance for his family. Neither he nor his daughter were deported to the Nazi camps. Following the arrest of the family, Anne was sent to Westerbork transit camp, and on to Auschwitz concentration camp before finally ending up in Bergen-Belsen, where she died in February 1945 at the age of 15, possibly from typhus. Her published diary spans the period in hiding between 1942 and her last entry on 1 August 1944.",News/World news,Apology over Dutch book that claimed to identify Anne Frank’s betrayer,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/apology-over-dutch-book-that-claimed-to-identify-anne-franks-betrayer
2/1/2022,"Police have been given extra time to question the Manchester United footballer Mason Greenwood on suspicion of rape and sexual assault. The 20-year-old was arrested on Sunday afternoon after a woman posted images, a video and audio online alleging he had assaulted her.  Greenwood has been held in custody since then and Greater Manchester police (GMP), who have not named the player, said detectives had now been given more time to question the suspect. The footballer, regarded as one of United’s rising young stars, was suspended from playing for or training with the club until further notice after the allegations. He remains on full pay, the Guardian understands. The images and allegations were visible on the woman’s Instagram on Sunday morning but have since been deleted. GMP said in a statement on Monday afternoon: “Detectives have been granted additional time to speak to a man in his 20s who is being held on suspicion of rape and assault of a woman. “Inquiries are ongoing and the victim is being offered specialist support. We remind people to avoid any commentary or sharing of images that could compromise the victim’s right to lifelong anonymity, or risk prejudicing a live investigation with active proceedings.”",News/UK news,Police get more time to question Mason Greenwood over alleged rape,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/31/police-get-more-time-to-question-mason-greenwood
2/1/2022,"In a 2021 study, 57% of UK residents said they wanted to be “more eco-friendly”, and for many people this quest has begun at home. Interest in green home improvements has grown thanks to increased awareness of sustainability and because, having spent a long time in their homes during the pandemic, householders have become more creative with renovations.  Everyone has a part to play in helping the environment – here’s how three people have done this at home … ‘We’re no longer wearing coats in our house’“We could almost see the energy disappearing out of the house and we realised this was having a damaging impact on the environment,” says Matt Lowing. When Lowing and his wife, Valéria, bought a 1930s semi in Tadworth, Surrey, they noticed it had drafts running through the downstairs. “We were shivering all the time and wasting lots of fuel,” he says. “We had very high heating bills, which was a concern but so was the environmental impact. For a while we would have a coal fire running to warm us up but then we realised that was bad for the environment too, so we decided to get some [more energy efficient] triple glazing installed.” The 46-year-old is delighted with the results, which have made his home a more comfortable place to live. “We’re no longer wearing coats in the house, which is nice, and we’ve noticed a significant reduction in our bills,” says Lowing. “The heat isn’t escaping through gaps in doors and old windows. “Also, since having our first child, Raphael, we’ve become more aware of how important sustainability is. We want to carry on making small changes that will hopefully make a difference to the home and the wider planet.” ‘I can see the birds and bees enjoying the garden we’ve created for them’Hanna Hammond lives with her husband, Mark, in the Wiltshire village of Great Somerford. Last year, they decided to transform their garden into an ethical, wildlife-friendly paradise. “There’s lots of wildlife around us and we wanted to make sure our garden was friendly to butterflies, bees, birds and hedgehogs,” she says. She and Mark consulted a gardener, who helped them select plants such as foxgloves and astrantia, which would attract bees, butterflies and birds. “There are lots of geraniums and they’re so prolific and robust that they’re basically thugs, which is great because the bumble bees love them,” she says. “So last summer we had different types of bees and it sounded amazing out there – you could really hear the buzzing.” The 50-year-old’s garden is on a hedgehog highway and she was keen to make it more safe and welcoming for the prickly visitors, particularly because she has six rescue dogs and they would sometimes “terrorise” the hedgehogs. So she has fenced off a part, giving the hedgehogs a safe space. She has also installed hedgehog tunnels in the fencing and left part of the grass to grow wild, so hedgehogs can hide in it. “We’ve also now got some hooligan sparrows that live in the hedging,” she smiles. “Itwas so lovely to look out of the office window and see all the birds and bees enjoying the garden we’ve created for them.” For Hammond, the transformation of the garden was a philosophical, as well as physical, pursuit. “I believe that a garden can either take away from the environment and the animals or it can give to them,” she says. “We prefer to give. The countryside belongs to the animals and not us. We just live here with them.” ‘Insulating the loft was quick and easy to get done’When Saphia Fleury and her husband moved from London to Hull in 2020, they noticed that their winter heating bills at the new home were “colossal” because it was poorly insulated. To address the issue, they decided to get insulation put in their loft, and were surprised how cheap this was – less than £200 – and how simple. “I think people imagine it’s complex, akin to getting a new roof, but it’s really quick and easy to get it done,” she says. “It took an afternoon. They brought in these big rolls of insulation material and just unrolled them across the floor of the loft and then they were done.” Fleury says she wanted to make her house as energy-efficient as she could – “for ourselves and the environment”. She says the simple improvement has made her house warmer and it now doesn’t take so long to heat up. “We find we don’t need to have the heating on at night, thanks to the insulation,” she says. “It’s nice to know that you’re not just burning fuel unnecessarily and that you can save money,” adds Fleury, who also buys appliances that are as energy-efficient as possible and is replacing any spent light bulbs with LED versions. With predictions that gas bills will soar, Fleury is even more delighted she got her loft insulated. “There’s been a very noticeable difference and I really recommend it,” she says. For anyone looking to make their home more environmentally friendly, roof windows from Velux may well hit the spot because the manufacturer has put sustainability at the core of its strategy. In keeping with goal 3 of the UN 2030 sustainable development goals, the Velux Group says it strives to bring “health and wellbeing” to a building’s users. When it comes to sustainability, the durability of a product is key, which is why Velux roof windows are built to last for at least three decades. Additionally, Velux is working on deep emission cuts across its entire value chain. Velux roof windows are made with wood from responsibly managed forests thanks to the company’s forest partners, with replacement trees being planted and biodiversity and wildlife habitats protected.

2/1/2022,"It can be easy to lose track of the main alleged lockdown parties, leaving dos, “wine Fridays” and work meetings being investigated by Sue Gray and by the Metropolitan police. Here is a full rundown of who is looking into what, and the broad details of all the claims we know about.  1) 20 May 2020: ‘BYOB’ in No 10 garden One of the more explosive revelations, after the publication of a leaked email to No 10 staff inviting them, during the first lockdown, to “make the most of the lovely weather” and attend drinks in the garden, adding “BYOB” – “bring your own booze”. The email was sent by Johnson’s principal private secretary, senior civil servant Martin Reynolds. The PM and his wife Carrie attended for a time. Johnson apologised but insisted he only realised in retrospect it might have been a social gathering. 2) 18 June 2020: Cabinet Office gathering for departure of official This is a claim that has not previously seen the light of day. Gray’s report describes it only as “a gathering in the Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall, on the departure of a No 10 private secretary”. No indication whether Johnson was present. 3) 19 June 2020: PM’s surprise birthday The most recent public revelation. Downing Street has accepted that about 30 people, among them the interior designer Lulu Lytle, who is not a member of staff but was renovating Johnson’s flat, gathered to mark Johnson’s birthday in the cabinet room. No 10 say Johnson was there for less than 10 minutes. There was, reportedly, a birthday cake, singing, and picnic food from Marks & Spencer. The Northern Ireland minister, Conor Burns, later memorably defended Johnson, saying the PM had been “ambushed with a cake”. 4) 13 November 2020: No 10 leaving event On the day that Johnson’s former chief aide Dominic Cummings was removed, there is a mention of “a gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of a special adviser”. As Cummings left abruptly, this seems likely to refer to the departure on the same day of Lee Cain, Johnson’s then head of communications. It is not clear whether Johnson attended. 5) 13 November 2020: gathering in Johnson’s flat Sources have reported that on the day Cummings departed, loud music and other party noises came from the No 11 flat occupied by Johnson and his wife Carrie, a known foe of Cummings. Downing Street has denied any rule-breaking, and it is not clear who was there. 6) 17 December 2020: the Christmas quiz An alleged social event took place in the office of the cabinet secretary, Simon Case – who was initially meant to have led the Gray report but stepped down after the claim about his own office. The invite billed it as a “Christmas party”, but government insiders said it was a virtual quiz and Case only passed through the event on the way to his office. Johnson did not attend. 7) 17 December 2020: Cabinet Office leaving event for senior official Kate Josephs, the former Covid taskforce head, has apologised for attending a drinks gathering to mark her leaving the civil service on the same day. She is now chief executive of Sheffield city council, where her future is uncertain. 8) 17 December 2020: No 10 leaving event Another previously unknown gathering mentioned in the report. It says only: “A gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of a No 10 official.” It is not clear who that was, or who attended. 9) 18 December 2020: No 10 Christmas party According to witnesses, dozens of staff gathered for a Christmas party, with cheese and wine passed around, a mock awards ceremony and secret Santa gifts exchanged. This event propelled coverage of the parties after a video emerged of Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s then press secretary, joking about it a few days later. 10) 14 January 2021: No 10 leaving event for officials Another claim emerging for the first time in Gray’s report. It is described thus: “A gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of two No 10 private secretaries.” It is not confirmed who they are, or who attended. 11) 16 April 2021: Downing Street garden/first leaving party One of the most damaging claims – that on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral, where the Queen sat alone, two leaving events were held in No 10. The first, and seemingly less rowdy, was for James Slack, who was the prime minister’s official spokesperson under both Theresa May and Johnson, before becoming Johnson’s director of communications. Johnson was at Chequers that evening. 12) 16 April 2021: Downing Street garden/second leaving party The second of the events, for a government photographer, reportedly began in the basement, with music played by an official. It is believed this is the event for which an official bought a suitcase full of wine from a nearby supermarket. The two events later combined in the garden, where one reveller sat on and broke the swing of Johnson’s infant son, Wilfred. 13) 15 May 2020: gathering in No 10 garden This was the event captured in a now famous photo shown to the Guardian, portraying a series of groups on the No 10 terrace and lawn, among them the Johnsons, Cummings and Reynolds, sitting at a table with wine and a cheese board. The Gray report refers only to “a photograph showing a number of groups in the garden of No 10 Downing Street”, perhaps indicating that she did not hear from witnesses about it. Johnson insisted he believed it was a work event. 14) 27 November 2020: No 10 leaving do For No 10 aide Cleo Watson. Johnson is known to have attended the event, remarking on how crowded the room was before making a short speech and leaving. 15) 10 December 2020: Department for Education Christmas event Gavin Williamson, then education secretary, held drinks in his department for staff. The department’s most senior civil servant, Susan Acland-Hood, said she attended the “work-related” gathering in which people congregated in the canteen for Williamson to “say a few words”. 16) 15 December 2020: No 10 Christmas quiz Johnson hosted the Christmas quiz in Downing Street, and was pictured on a screen reading out questions flanked by staff who wore tinsel and a Santa hat. Some staff joined virtually, but sources said others crowded around desks. 17) 25 November 2020: Treasury ‘impromptu drinks’ The Treasury defended officials holding an “impromptu” drinks party to celebrate Rishi Sunak’s autumn spending review during lockdown. A spokesperson said a “small number” of staff had celebrated around their desks. 18) Before Christmas 2020: defence adviser leaving event The Mirror alleged that the PM gave a speech at a leaving event for his then defence adviser, Capt Steve Higham, in the run-up to Christmas. 19) 14 December 2020: CCHQ Christmas party for Shaun Bailey A picture showed that an event hosted by the campaign for the Conservatives’ London mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, was held in Tory campaign headquarters, with buffet food. Police are looking into the gathering. 20) 16 December 2020: Department for Transport gathering The Mirror said staff of the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, threw a Christmas party at which almost a dozen staff were “boozing and dancing” in a Whitehall office.",News/Politics,Lockdown parties and events: 20 gatherings we know about so far,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/lockdown-parties-and-events-20-gatherings-we-know-about-so-far

2/1/2022,"Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, vowed Russian oligarchs and key supporters of president Vladimir Putin will be targeted by UK sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine, but left Britain’s existing much criticised anti-corruption laws largely untouched. Insisting Putin’s allies will have nowhere to hide their assets if an invasion goes ahead, the Foreign Office, clearly working in lockstep with the US, threatened to seize the wealth of Putin’s inner political circle and business backers.  Truss, giving a statement to MPs, refused to name any individual Russians at risk of being sanctioned, saying the aim was to create the maximum anxiety among Putin’s allies. Labour criticised the package for failing to speed up the long-promised structural measures to tackle money laundering in the UK, including measures first announced by David Cameron in 2014 and 2015. A US official, setting out the Biden administration’s largely identical plans to hit the personal wealth of Putin’s coterie, said: “The individuals we have identified are in or near the inner circles of the Kremlin and play a role in government decision-making or are at a minimum complicit in the Kremlin’s destabilising behaviour.” Russia described the transatlantic measures as extremely alarming and likely to damage the business climate in the UK. The net of those liable to sanctions in the UK is being widened in the event of an invasion by making Russians and companies supportive of Putin liable to travel bans and asset freezes. Previously only individuals regarded as guilty of destabilising the sovereignty of Ukraine could be sanctioned, although the UK can and has sanctioned Russians for human rights abuses and corruption. Currently 180 Russian individuals and 48 entities are subject to UK sanctions, more than half linked to the destabilisation of Ukraine. Truss, due in Moscow for talks in the next fortnight, told MPs the proposals mean the UK will be able to act in lockstep with the US. Truss said: “Whether you support Russia’s aggressive actions against Ukraine, or you’re of wider significance to the Kremlin, we will have the power to sanction you. “Nothing is off the table and there will be nowhere to hide. “This will amount to the toughest sanctions regime against Russia we have had in place yet, and mark the biggest change in our approach since leaving the European Union.” The reference to nothing being off the table was designed to show the government had not abandoned other structural measures. These include reform of Companies House, a register of properties held by overseas citizens and a public register of beneficial ownership in the Overseas Territories, measures that have been repeatedly promised but held back due to opposition from the City of London. Some of the stiffest opposition is coming from Gulf states and not Russia. An economic crime bill containing many of the measures looks likely to be delayed, a move that has infuriated the government’s own anti-corruption tsar, John Penrose. In the Lords on Monday ministers were challenged about their personal links to firms operating in tax shelters. John Heathershaw, co-author of a recent Chatham House report on “Britain’s kleptocracy problem”, said: “The use of sanctions here appears to be as an ad hoc and preventive measure – essentially as a form of deterrence. The reason such measures are necessary is that there is already a great deal of money in the UK from Russia which has been welcomed by UK banks, estate agents, football clubs and companies with minimal checks on the sources of wealth and beneficial ownership. The problems that led to the UK welcoming suspicious Russian wealth are structural British problems.” He added: “Problems arise because of an imbalance of power not between the UK and Russia, but between the public and private sectors in the UK. The National Crime Agency and Serious Fraud Office are outgunned, under-resourced, and see a revolving door of staff going back into the private sector when they’ve made regulations and got to know the loopholes.” President Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described Truss’s package as an “extremely alarming” statement that “undermines investment attractiveness and the United Kingdom’s attractiveness as such”. “It’s not often you see or hear such direct threats to attack a business,” Peskov told reporters. He added that Moscow will “proceed from its own interests when formulating retaliatory measures”. “An attack by one particular country on Russian business of course implies retaliatory measures,” he said. The Russian ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin stressed that the UK is now pursuing an “aggressive line” in Europe regarding Ukraine. He said the exaggeration of the “Russian threat” is being stoked by Britain’s domestic problems. Russia last week expanded its blacklist of EU and members states’ personnel on a no-fly list who Russia said “were personally involved in promoting anti-Russian policy”. But Britain for its part is likely to highlight that its post-Brexit sanctions policy is more agile than the EU, where sanctions requires unanimous support from member states. A US Treasury report ordered by Congress in 2018 identified 210 of Russia’s richest tycoons and allies of Putin for potential sanctions. The list was compiled as a response to alleged Kremlin interference in the 2016 US presidential vote. Russians with a net worth of more than $1bn were included in the list of 96 oligarchs, largely compiled from a US magazine wealth list. 114 others, including senior Kremlin and government officials, as well as CEOs of state companies, were also named.",News/World news,Liz Truss vows ‘nowhere to hide’ for Putin allies if Ukraine invaded,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/liz-truss-vows-nowhere-to-hide-for-putin-allies-if-ukraine-invaded
2/1/2022,"Galina Samsova, who has died aged 84, was a ballerina with a distinctive Russian style, who was acclaimed in the west at a time when few Soviet-trained dancers were performing there. A radiant and musical dancer, Samsova was noted for her soaring jump, her stunningly eloquent and pliable back, her rich port de bras and her acting ability. Once seen she was not forgotten, despite lacking the advantages of a traditional ballerina’s body. Not only was Samsova a great dancer but she was also a generous person, ever ready to help her colleagues and young dancers. She was loved and respected by those she worked with, and in the last three decades was in demand as a judge at international ballet competitions. It was through seeing talented young dancers in competitions that she brought, for example, the Czech Daria Klimentová and Spanish Tamara Rojo to Scottish Ballet, where in the 1990s she served as artistic director, launching their careers in Britain.  As she rarely danced with the most publicised companies, making few appearances with the Royal Ballet (although she did dance Kenneth MacMillan’s Isadora in 1982), Samsova was less of a household name in Britain than she deserved to be. Samsova was permitted to move from Ukraine to the west, initially joining the National Ballet of Canada, in 1960 when she met and married Alexander Ursuliak, a Canadian-Ukrainian teacher who was extending his experience of Russian dance. The marriage eventually ended in divorce. Her arrival just months before the defection of Rudolf Nureyev attracted nothing like the same attention in the media. She had only been of soloist rank at the Kiev Opera Ballet, but quietly she exerted a similar influence, staging short works from the Russian repertoire such as Laurencia. She also mounted the version of the virtuosic Corsaire pas de deux (in Robert Klavin’s staging) in Canada just weeks before Nureyev presented it partnering Margot Fonteyn in London. As the critic James Neufeld noted: “At a time when artistic contact with Russia was virtually impossible, her arrival generated excitement and artistic ferment within the company. Samsova was an electrifying performer, in full command of the Russian strength and athleticism which Canadian dancers had only heard about.” Samsova secured her position as an international star, dancing the title role in Cinderella, choreographed by Vaslav Orlikovsky, for the first international festival of dance in Paris in 1963. Receiving the festival’s gold medal opened doors for Samsova to guest with a range of companies, and she eventually found a “home” at London Festival Ballet (1964-73). Galina Martinova Samtsova (her name was simplified to Samsova in the west) was born in Stalingrad (now Volgograd). On her own initiative, as a child she auditioned for, and was offered a place at, the Kiev Opera Ballet school, where she became a pupil of Natalia Verekundova. But she then had to win her parents’ approval to accept. She graduated into the company in Kiev in 1956, and never severed her links with the Kiev Opera Ballet. She returned to dance in Swan Lake and later to research for the acclaimed production of that ballet she mounted with Sir Peter Wright for the Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet in 1981. At the National Ballet of Canada in the early 60s, she was exposed for the first time to choreography by Antony Tudor (whose dramatic work she enjoyed), George Balanchine and John Cranko, a trio of choreographers whose work she would include in Scottish Ballet’s repertory when she became artistic director there three decades later. After moving to London Festival Ballet, she could be relied on to add glamour and excitement to the ballet’s divertissement and mixed programmes, dancing Le Corsaire and the lyrically acrobatic Spring Waters. She triumphed as an interpretive artist in Swan Lake with her lyricism and pathos; brought femininity, charm and wit to the lively Kitri in Don Quixote (1970); and her performances as Giselle were ethereal and deeply moving. In the 1970s she established New London Ballet with her partner and second husband, André Prokovsky, whom she had met while guesting and brought back to London Festival Ballet. They married in 1972. New London Ballet was a small company designed to tour in Europe and Asia, focusing on creating new ballets. Samsova was delighted by opportunities to work closely with leading choreographers, many of whom invited her to dance elsewhere. As she said: “Some things worked choreographically, some things didn’t … but at least it gave me a chance to … see how I could develop in another way.” For Samsova, Peter Darrell created Desdemona in his Othello (1971) and the mature but still vibrantly passionate courtesan Léa in Chéri (1980). Jack Carter made a powerful 20-minute solo for Samsova as the Delphic Sybil in Pythoness Ascendant (1973) in which she developed into a visionary prophetess of awesome grandeur. Prokovsky drew on his wife’s comic ability in his academic showpiece Vespri (1972), and, later, her dramatic talent in Königsmark, as well as Anna Karenina (both 1979), for Australian Ballet. In the late 70s she began appearing as a guest with Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet, joining the company from 1980 until 1990. Here again, her wide repertoire revealed her versatility, and she had the opportunity to create and dance roles for MacMillan. She also became an inspiring and considerate company teacher, and produced the grand pas from Paquita, and, in 1999, Giselle with David Bintley. After a brief period in 1990 as a caretaker artistic director for Scottish Ballet in the interregnum following Darrell’s death, she was officially appointed to the post in 1991. While there, she built up the company’s academic ballet repertoire and invited Jasper Conran to design new productions of Sleeping Beauty and Swan Lake. She also invited Robert Cohan to choreograph full evening ballets. Eventually, frustrated by funding cuts, in 1997 she resigned. Samsova and Prokovsky divorced in 1981.
