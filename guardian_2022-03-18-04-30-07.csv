3/18/2022,"A pub that was the setting for a novel by Daphne du Maurier has banned hunts from meeting on its land after 100 years of the practice. The Jamaica Inn in Cornwall – immortalised in the 1936 novel of the same name about smuggling – announced the decision after the East Cornwall Hunt invited the Beaufort Hunt to meet there on Saturday, a move the pub called “extremely ill-advised”. Both hunts said the venue on Bodmin Moor, its staff and customers had been targeted by “activists” online. The Jamaica Inn, which was built in 1750 as a coaching inn for travellers, wrote on Facebook that it had never supported hunting but had allowed “hunts to start from the inn because of the 100-year tradition of doing so”. It said: “Last Saturday the local hunt invited the Beaufort Hunt to join their usual modest gathering which the owner sees as extremely ill-advised. Taking this fully into account and the passionate views of some of the inn’s customers, the owner has decided to no longer allow any future hunt at Jamaica Inn.” The inn’s owner, Allen Jackson, said some people had cancelled hotel and restaurant bookings since Saturday because of the association with hunting. He said that after hunts, “hundreds and hundreds of people, seemingly reasonable and rational, were telling us they were anti the hunt.” Jackson told the BBC: “These were not extreme views but reasonable views. We have always lost money because some people won’t come here because of the association with hunts. There are no pluses, all we get is minuses. They never spent any money here – they never came in. “The hunting fraternity want to make it seem we have been browbeaten and bullied into this decision but it is nothing like that whatsoever.” Chris Luffingham, the director of external affairs at the League Against Cruel Sports, said: “We welcome this move by the landlord to ban hunts from his pub – it ties in with the mood of the general public, the vast majority of whom are sick and tired of this cruel and barbaric activity.” He called on “more businesses across the UK to enhance their ethical credentials by breaking all ties to fox hunts”. The Beaufort Hunt, one of the largest and oldest hunts in the UK, said the decision was “a result of activists targeting a rural business and attacking their customer base”. It added: “We hope the hunting community continues to show support for this local business as they have done for many years.” The East Cornwall Hunt said it understood there had been “an orchestrated attempt online to intimidate pub staff” by “anti-hunt fanatics”.",News/UK news,Jamaica Inn pub calls time on 100 years of hunts meeting on its land,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/17/cornish-pub-calls-time-on-100-years-of-hunts-meeting-on-its-land
3/18/2022,"Under the banner of Inclusive Britain, the equalities and levelling up minister, Kemi Badenoch, on Thursday set out a raft of measures (68 in all) aimed at reducing disparities between black and minority ethnic people and the white population. She also committed the government to a new approach to data and language in this area: the term BAME will no longer be used in Whitehall. Instead, more attention will be paid to the specific experiences of different groups. That has raised concerns that broader issues of racism will be overlooked or dismissed. This much was expected, and had been trailed in last year’s report from the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities to which her announcement is the official response. The report earned well-deserved criticism for its Panglossian view of race relations and lack of enthusiasm for the term “institutional racism”. Ms Badenoch’s response marks an improvement on the report itself, although she shares its authors’ determination to take a broadly positive view of multicultural Britain. This week’s news of a grotesquely inappropriate strip search carried out by police on a 15-year-old black girl in an east London school vividly conveys the limitations of this approach. Investigators decided that racism was likely to have been an “influencing factor” in the way the girl was treated, and she remains extremely distressed. While the details of this incident are shocking, its basic features are familiar. There is a wealth of evidence, in both individual cases and statistics, revealing racial disparities in experiences and outcomes across all walks of life – education, health, and the criminal justice system. These have been explored in detail by numerous previous government-ordered reports. Of course, there are good things about multicultural Britain and other factors than race that determine life chances. Class, economic and other inequalities overlap in important ways. But minimising racism – whether societal, institutional or individual – will not make it go away. We need to embed understanding of the way it operates – including in organisations such as the police, or in the Home Office’s handling of the Windrush scandal – and not pretend that this is all in the past. The new emphasis on enforcement and litigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission announced by Ms Badenoch could be constructive, if adequately resourced. Currently, the burden of proving discrimination rests heavily on complainants. Her promise to improve alternative provision, where children excluded from school are taught, is also welcome, along with firmer guidance on exclusions. A new model history curriculum could be a useful tool, though not if it becomes another battle in the divisive “war on woke” being promoted by some ministers. Other measures appear vague and unanchored in existing policy. Local panels to scrutinise police, including the use of force and stop and search, are unlikely to build confidence until well-founded concerns about institutional discrimination have been dealt with. There is no sign of the resources that the NHS will need if it is to reduce health inequalities, or of the poverty-reduction strategy that would underpin any serious move in this direction. Educational inequalities are widening rather than narrowing. Against this backdrop, it is hard to believe that “inclusive Britain” will amount to more than warm words.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Tory anti-racism: warm words and denial | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/17/the-guardian-view-on-tory-anti-racism-warm-words-and-denial
3/18/2022,"The European Space Agency has suspended its €1bn ExoMars mission, a joint project with Russia that was due to launch a robotic rover in September. Member states of the ESA voted on Thursday to cancel the launch due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “The decision was made that this launch cannot happen, given the current circumstances and especially the sanctions that are imposed by our member states,” said agency director general Josef Aschbacher. “This makes it practically impossible, but also politically impossible to have a launch of [the rover] in September.” The Mars rover, named Rosalind Franklin, was assembled in the UK ahead of a planned launch aboard a Russian rocket. After travelling to Mars on a German-built spacecraft, it would have been shepherded to the surface by a Russian lander. Now, instead, the rover will be placed in storage for the foreseeable future. The decision was viewed as inevitable but is a major blow to Europe’s space programme. The next available launch window, based on the alignment of the Earth and Mars, will be 2024, but the technical and political issues may take longer than this to resolve. The Esa has commissioned a feasibility study of how to get ExoMars off the ground without Roscosmos involvement. Working with Nasa is one option and Aschbacher said the US agency had expressed a “strong willingness to support” the mission. Rosalind Franklin is the second stage of the joint European-Russian mission. The first part, a satellite called the Trace Gas Orbiter, was launched in 2016 and is studying the planet’s atmosphere. It was also supposed to act as a telecommunications relay for Rosalind Franklin when the rover arrived. The rover was intended to drill 2m into the surface of Mars to look for signs of life. There are no comparable missions slated in the next decade and the rover should remain viable for several years in storage. However, keeping the mission alive is likely to add significantly to its more than €1bn price tag. The Esa also said on Thursday that five satellite missions expected to be launched by Soyuz had been cancelled after the decision by Roscosmos to withdraw their personnel from Europe’s spaceport in French Guiana. However, Aschbacher said that the situation aboard the International Space Station (ISS) – currently home to four Americans, two Russians, and one German ESA astronaut – remained stable. “Astronauts are working nominally. They are doing well and doing their operations as planned,” he said. Earlier this week, Nasa confirmed that one of its astronauts will still share a ride back from the ISS with two cosmonauts aboard their Soyuz capsule later this month.",News/Science,European Space Agency suspends €1bn Mars mission with Russia ,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/17/european-space-agency-suspends-1bn-mars-mission-with-russia
3/18/2022,"Attacks on hospitals and healthcare workers. Escalating strikes claiming the lives of civilians, including children. A growing humanitarian crisis, with vast numbers forced to flee their homes. A flagrant disregard for human life. These terrible scenes are witnessed not only in Ukraine, where Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion has transfixed the world, but in other wars across the globe that have largely slipped from the public’s attention – in Myanmar, where the military tries to crush resistance to its seizure of power just over a year ago; in Ethiopia, where the prime minister believed he could win a swift victory against the Tigray region’s leaders, but fighting continues 16 months on; in Yemen, riven by conflict since 2014; in Syria, where the war entered its 12th year this week. Ukraine’s war was once in the shadows too: the long-running conflict in the Donbas had been largely forgotten until Russian troops began massing at the country’s borders late last year. In each of these cases, the parallels or connections to what is happening there now go beyond suffering, death and mass displacement. For Syrians in the rebel enclave of Idlib, who saw Russia save Bashar al-Assad, its tactics in Ukraine are painfully recognisable: “Fortify your hospitals with cement blocks; the enemy Putin does not distinguish between civilians, wounded people and fighters,” one medic said. Syrian troops are being recruited to fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. In Ethiopia, too, health workers have been attacked and grotesque violations of the laws of war have become the norm: this week a horrifying video emerged on showing armed men burning a Tigrayan man to death in western Ethiopia. As many as half a million people have died from the violence and hunger caused by the war, researchers said this week. In Yemen, more than 4 million people have been displaced, and escalating violence made January the deadliest month for civilians since 2018. The World Food Programme warned it was already forced to take food from the hungry to feed the starving, and might soon be unable to feed even the starving. Yet Wednesday’s UN funding conference raised less than a third of the $4.2bn desperately needed. In Myanmar, military and security forces have committed systematic and widespread abuses, bombarding populated areas with airstrikes and heavy weapons and deliberately targeting civilians. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, on Monday urged the international community to take “concerted, immediate measures” to halt the spiral of violence. Some supporters of the deposed civilian government hope that the unprecedented sanctions imposed on Russia will help to make the case for further action against Myanmar’s junta. While the EU recently expanded sanctions to a state-owned oil and gas company, the US has been slow to act. Yet others fear that the conflict in Ukraine will drag away the political attention and resources needed to put the generals under pressure. Meanwhile, aid agencies find the multiple conflicts, the disastrous conditions in Afghanistan and what is described as the worst-ever hunger crisis in South Sudan have left them torn between grim choices. More humanitarian funding is needed, alongside political will and diplomatic energy. The victims of these other wars deserve the same level of support and solidarity rightly seen for the people of Ukraine. Those already too often overlooked must not be pushed further into the shadows.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on forgotten wars: we must not neglect conflict’s other victims | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/17/the-guardian-view-on-forgotten-wars-we-must-not-neglect-conflicts-other-victims
3/18/2022,"A Conservative MP has backed calls for dozens of Marks & Spencer stores across Russia to be shut immediately, suggesting Vladimir Putin is funnelling every rouble made in the country into the invasion of Ukraine. Alicia Kearns, who hosted four Ukrainian parliamentarians in the House of Commons on Thursday, said any profits generated would be tainted by the killings and war crimes committed during the conflict. Two weeks ago, M&S stopped supplying its Turkish franchisee’s businesses in Russia, which has 48 shops and 1,200 employees. However the stores remain open and continue to sell their existing stock. Some other chains that operate in Russia by franchise, such as McDonald’s, have been able to close their doors, given the agreements differ between companies. Alyona Shkrum, a Ukrainian MP who met senior UK government figures including the prime minister, Boris Johnson, on Thursday, called for Britain to put more pressure on firms still operating in Russia. “The UK has been very active in leading – they were one of the first countries with a lot of companies to leave, but there are still three big companies who haven’t left,” she said, adding: “Marks & Spencer has not left Russia.” Shkrum said all money generated in Russia “goes just to the army” and added that there had been several reports of invading troops raping Ukrainian women. Another Ukrainian MP, Maria Mezentseva, added: “Everything that is contributed to the Russians is coming back severely with bloody bullets to innocent Ukrainians.” Kearns backed the call for all M&S shops in Russia to close and raised concern about the reports of “sexual violence” committed by soldiers. Referencing the M&S advertising slogan, she said: “This isn’t just any food, it’s blood and rape food.” Speaking to the Guardian, Kearns added: “It is wrong that some British businesses continue to operate, because all they are doing is buttressing Putin’s brutality and funding his war coffers.” M&S said in a statement that it did not operate stores or have any employees in Russia and the franchise licensee held the rights to trade under the firm’s banner in both Ukraine and Russia. A spokesperson added: “We suspended deliveries to our franchise licensee’s Russian business two weeks ago and have no plans to reinstate them. We are actively discussing the future of the business with our franchise licensee.” Chris Bryant, a Labour MP and chair of the parliamentary group on Russia, told the Commons that other multinational companies still doing business in Russia included the fast food chain Subway and the tax advisory firm Baker Tilly. Subway said it had no corporate operations in Russia and that its 450 franchised restaurants in the country were all independently owned and operated. Baker Tilly International said it would “separate member firms in Russia and Belarus from our global network” and not “serve government clients or state-owned enterprises of Russia or Belarus, or sanctioned entities and individuals”. No 10 reiterated its call on businesses to “do nothing that could potentially support Putin’s regime and indeed do everything to put pressure on him to change course”.",News/World news,Tory MP backs calls for Marks & Spencer to shut stores in Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/tory-mp-backs-calls-for-marks-spencer-to-shut-stores-in-russia
3/18/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has vowed to intensify his overhaul of France’s welfare state, tax system and labour market if he wins a second term as president next month, arguing that transforming French society would protect people at a time of crisis when the war in Ukraine marks “a return of tragedy in history”. The 44-year-old centrist leader has risen in the polls since Russia’s invasion and is a clear favourite to win April’s election – which would make him the first French president to win re-election in 20 years. But he has been under pressure from opponents to explain his economic and social policy. “We are at a tipping point where we can make a real difference,” Macron said during a four-hour press conference at a former warehouse in the northern suburbs of Paris, warning of a mix of global crises including Ukraine, the Covid pandemic, climate change and the challenges of self-sufficiency in farming. Macron vowed to step up his changes to the welfare state and the benefits system, raising the pension age and continuing to cut taxes for businesses and households. Brushing aside the potential for widespread street demonstrations, he said people must “work longer” in order to protect France’s generous pensions system. Although Macron has been boosted by his stature on the international scene, voters are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis and pollsters fear abstention could be significant if the election is seen as a foregone conclusion. Macron said that if re-elected he would move swiftly to carry out the pensions overhaul that he had failed to put in place in his current mandate. He would gradually increase the pension age from 62 to 65, bringing it into line with countries such as the UK and Germany, while setting a minimum pension rate at €1,100 a month. He said he had “learned the lessons” from his past difficulties. In 2019, Macron’s proposed pensions overhaul sparked protests that lasted longer than any strike since the wildcat workers’ stoppages of 1968, and the measures were shelved during the pandemic. Macron said he would also radically overhaul the unemployment benefits system to push people back to work. This would include requiring unemployed people to undertake 15 to 20 hours of work or training a week. In another politically risky change, all social benefits – for unemployment, housing or childcare – would be centralised in a single system, affecting up to 20 million people. “It’s quite normal, especially when you consider the state of public coffers, that we work more,” he said. Macron has gained five to six points in opinion polls over the past month, and is well ahead of the far-right Marine Le Pen, who is currently in second place. He is favourite to win the first round on 10 April by a wide margin. But it is not clear which candidate will face him in the final round on 24 April. Le Pen is being trailed in the polls by three candidates: the rightwing challenger Valérie Pécresse, the far-right former TV pundit Éric Zemmour and the hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whose campaign is gaining momentum. Polls show Macron beating all of them. Despite that, Macron remains a divisive figure in France. When he came to power five years ago he was a former banker who had served as economy minister under the left and promised a new kind of “pragmatic” centrist politics that he said would liberalise the economy. He loosened strict labour laws, but his pro-business moves – cutting corporate taxes and transforming the wealth tax into a property tax – swiftly led to him being labelled “president of the rich”, a tag he has struggled to shake off. His reform programme was hit by two major crises. First, the gilets jaunes protest movement over fuel prices that turned into an anti-government revolt. Then the Covid pandemic, which has killed more than 138,000 people in France and exposed strains on the health service. In response, Macron turned to state interventionism and vast public spending. He boasted of “nationalising wages” to keep the country afloat. Macron now faces accusations from critics including Gérard Larcher, the rightwing head of the senate, that he could be re-elected too easily. Larcher said Macron could win re-election “without ever really having been a candidate, without a campaign, without a debate, without a competition between ideas”, leaving questions over his mandate to govern during a second term. Macron angrily brushed aside Larcher’s comments and stood by his record in office. “I promised lower unemployment … despite the crises, we did it,” he said, adding that if re-elected his aim was to wipe out unemployment entirely. He also said France could be one of the first countries to wean itself off fossil fuels, and he wanted to build a “European metaverse” to compete with US tech firms and make Europe more independent. He promised greater protection for children online by increasing regulation of social networks, and a consultation on changes to the education and health systems.",News/World news,Emmanuel Macron vows to step up welfare reforms if re-elected,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/emmanuel-macron-vows-to-step-up-welfare-reforms-if-re-elected
3/18/2022,"Thousands more undergraduates have pulled out of their studies since the start of the academic year, amid suggestions that the pandemic is continuing to take a toll on British universities and students. New figures from the Student Loans Company show that more than 18,000 students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland withdrew from university courses and stopped receiving loans by February this year, an increase of more than 4,000 compared with the same point in 2021, and 3,000 more than in pre-pandemic February 2019. The figures cover full-time and part-time students who have notified the Student Loans Company that they have withdrawn, and excludes those who never started their courses or have been suspended. In England there was a 28% annual increase in withdrawals by the fourth week of February, with the rate increasing as the academic year progressed. Higher education providers in Wales saw a 62% annual increase in withdrawals by late February. The figures come as lecturers and academics said they were seeing higher rates of absence among their students, as many staff and students continued to be affected by Covid. The Department for Education (DfE) cautioned that the SLC’s figures were experimental, open to wide fluctuation, and should be treated with caution. It also noted that the 18,321 withdrawals accounted for less than 1.5% of the more than 1 million undergraduates receiving student finance, based on the SLC’s data for the 2021-22 academic year. Official figures published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) showed that student drop-out rates in 2020-21 were well below those of previous, non-pandemic years. Just 5.3% of UK students who first enrolled in 2019-20 failed to continue their courses in 2020-21, compared with 6.5% or more in each of the previous five years. Michelle Donelan, the minister for higher and further education, said: “I have long argued that when it comes to university, getting on is every bit as important as getting in, and that universities must focus on tackling drop-out rates among students. “That is why it is so greatly welcome to see that for the first time, it is projected over 90% of students will complete a qualification – the highest rate ever recorded.” Based on the 2020-21 continuation rates, the DfE calculates that just 9.4% of full-time first degree entrants in the UK are projected to leave HE with no award. The change was particularly marked in Scotland, where non-continuation rates fell from 7% – above England and Wales – to 4.5% in the space of a year. The Hesa data also showed sharp falls in drop-out rates at some of the worst-affected institutions. The University of Suffolk saw non-continuation rates among school leavers plunge from nearly 25% in 2019 to 13.6% in 2020. Goldsmiths College, University of London, was unusual in seeing its non-continuation rate of young undergraduates continue to rise, from 10% to 11.6%.",News/Education,Thousands of students drop out of university as pandemic takes its toll,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/17/thousands-of-students-drop-out-of-university-as-pandemic-takes-its-toll
3/18/2022,"Ministers have made a U-turn on a pledge to limit the time or earnings on MPs’ second jobs, one of several rule changes promised by Boris Johnson last year in order to stop abuse of the system. The proposed changes were announced after there was a public outcry when the former cabinet minister Owen Paterson was censured for breaching lobbying rules and another, Geoffrey Cox, was found to have been voting by proxy when doing work for law clients in the Caribbean. MPs have objected to some of the proposals which are being considered by the Commons standards committee, including on time limits, declarations of their contracts, and to new rules that would add “respect” as a principle for the MPs’ code of conduct and aim to limit abuse in the chamber. Here are some of the MPs’ views submitted to the committee: Complexity brings errors, which then bring the house into disrepute – contrary to the code’s purpose. Limiting time or limiting income does not improve the honesty and integrity of the system – it just creates more opportunity for errors. The consequences of even the smallest transgression are public and humiliating, both personally and politically. Therefore, it is absolutely worth getting this right. Sadly, this report and consultation I fear leads us in the opposite direction by creating greater complexity, more rules and increased subjectivity. It seems to me that the principal concerns here are about potential conflict of interest and neglect of constituents. Arbitrary limits on time spent on, or reward earned from, outside interests do not necessarily mirror either concern. Time spent as a nurse also has the same impact on time available for constituents as time spent as a hedge fund manager. Again, transparency is the most effective way for constituents to determine whether they find the arrangements of their member of parliament acceptable or not. … The code should be kept as brief as possible and enable MPs to take responsibility for themselves within broad boundaries. The baseline assumption as a new MP seems to be that I am on the scrounge and should be treated like a child and punished at the first opportunity. If we were treated like adults we would be far more likely en masse to act like them. We are not compensated for the huge invasion into our private lives that comes with this job, the security we have to live with, or the abuse we have to tolerate, and that our place of work treats us like young offenders makes the job nearby impossible. The revised system should not disincentivise people who would be an asset to the Commons from applying in the first place, nor encourage those with experience of their field to leave. Equally, any new rules should not reduce the likelihood of those with professional experience seeking to enter the house. Setting an arbitrary time limit on paid and unpaid outside interests would involve the commissioner policing an MP’s personal life and free time. This is not a desirable, nor a practical use of the commissioner’s time, and these matters are almost impossible to police, and could result in vexatious complaints against members. Frankly, I find the politics and personal behaviour of some politicians abhorrent. As an elected representative I have a right to make my opinions about them known, perhaps even a duty to do so. That is why I cannot support your determination to police the comments of MPs in any medium: it might be necessary to express contempt for hateful political positions. The stated intention of this proposal [regarding ‘respect’] is to protect against bullying and harassment in committees and divisions. Clearly, such behaviour would be wholly unacceptable and guarding against it is an entirely worthy aim. However, this proposal has unintended consequences that damage the workings of the house. It is foundational to our parliamentary democracy that we are not subject to investigation and sanction from outside bodies.",News/Politics,‘It’s assumed I am on the scrounge’: MPs’ views on second-job limits,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/17/its-assumed-i-am-on-the-scrounge-mps-views-on-second-job-limits
3/18/2022,"Boris Johnson is understood to be open to accepting an invitation to attend the European Council next week when EU leaders meet to discuss the war in Ukraine, though one has yet to be extended. A Downing Street source said Johnson would be in Brussels next week for a Nato summit, along with the US president, Joe Biden, who will attend the council meeting later that afternoon. They said it remained a possibility for Johnson to attend the council meeting – which would be a major symbolic step post-Brexit. However, the decision on whether to invite Johnson to the EU summit is for the European Council president, Charles Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium. EU sources said that no such invitation had been sent to Downing Street and that this was not expected to change. A spokesperson for Michel said: “No comment.” Officially, Johnson’s spokesperson said his presence at the summit was not confirmed. “At this stage we haven’t confirmed plans for next week with regards to either the council or Nato,” he said. “We expect he will be attending the Nato summit but at this stage we haven’t confirmed anything. Asked specifically about whether he was considering attending the EU summit, the official added: “I’m not going to speculate. I think we’ve seen throughout this crisis in Ukraine, the invasion of Ukraine, that the UK is working extremely closely with European allies on that.” A precedent for a UK minister to attend special meetings in Brussels was set by Liz Truss earlier this month, when the foreign secretary attended a special meeting of the EU foreign affairs council. The US, Canada, and Ukraine were also invited to attend.

3/18/2022,"The parents-in-law of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe have joked that their son’s home needed to be tidied as it was in an “appalling” state, and said they hoped to see their daughter-in-law at the weekend. On BBC Breakfast, John Ratcliffe described his son Richard’s home as “appalling”, to which his wife, Barbara, replied: “It is, but if you can think about it, it was a three-bedroom flat when Nazanin got taken and they’d only got a baby in it. Well, that baby’s grown up.” They said Nazanin, Richard and their daughter, Gabriella, would be staying in accommodation provided by the Foreign Office for a couple of days – their own home is full of campaign material and Gabriella’s toys – before spending time with other family at the weekend. The following Sunday Gabriella would be able to give her mother a Mother’s Day card for the first time in her life, according to Richard Ratcliffe. He said their seven-year-old, who does not remember her mother as a free woman, had all her craft equipment ready to start making it. Three years ago he himself laid a card and 155 bunches of flowers – one for each week his wife had been in prison – outside the Iranian embassy in London. It is a modest ambition for a family forced apart by Nazanin’s wrongful six-year detention in Iran, but Ratcliffe said normal was what the family craved. “We can’t take back the time that’s gone. But we live in the future not the past,” he said. “We’ll take it one day at a time. I think it is going to be the beginning of a new life, a normal life and hopefully a happy family, with all the bumps and all the normal squabbles we had before.” He said the first thing Nazanin had said she wanted him to do for her on her return home was to make her a cup of tea. “So we will do that,” he said, adding that as she drank it, she could supervise a bit of tidying up around their flat. “I think, actually, we were looking at the house and it needs a bit of tidying, so there might be a bit of tidying, perhaps directed by mummy.” Clearly lurking at the back of his mind, however, was awareness that normal life is not a simple thing to recapture after the extraordinary experiences that the family have endured. “We’re both in our own way a bit battered, and that won’t play out today but it will manifest in different ways,” he said. “I’m not dwelling on that now, but it lurks at the back of your mind after six years apart: ‘How long will it take to really get back to normal?’” Gabriella, however, seemed to have clear ideas how to reintroduce her mother to her life. Ratcliffe said she had picked out which toys to take to show her mother when her plane landed, and wanted to play the piano for her and show off her craft equipment. “She wanted to show her mummy the things she can do now that she couldn’t before,” he said. According to Nazanin’s sister-in-law, Rebecca Ratcliffe, Gabriella spent Wednesday night sleeping between her parents in the safe house the family have been taken to for a couple of days to give them a chance to adjust. “It’s difficult for [Gabriella] to comprehend,” Rebecca told ITV. “It’s something she’s wanted for a long time but probably doesn’t know how to cope with. I just heard from Richard that [Gabriella] slept in the bed between them all last night. That’s a really special moment for all three of them.”",News/News,"Tea, toys and tidying as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe reunites with family",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/17/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-reunited-with-family
3/18/2022,"This week, two years after Black Lives Matter protests prompted by the death of George Floyd, and the prime minister’s promise of an urgent examination into the state of racism in the UK, the government has put forward an action plan in response to the controversial Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities (Cred) report. Cred was widely criticised by politicians, journalists, campaigners and the British public for downplaying the prevalence of institutional racism in Britain, to the extent that commission chair Dr Tony Sewell denied there was any evidence of its existence. Not only that, even its commissioners and contributors distanced themselves from its processes, questioned the report’s academic rigour and expressed concern about the tailoring of evidence to conform to a predetermined political narrative. No 10 was alleged to have spent three months rewriting its findings. A working group from the United Nations, an organisation usually defined by diplomatic reserve, went so far as to label the report an attempt to “normalise white supremacy”. Understandably, then, expectations of the response from the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, were low. Matters were scarcely helped when, in her foreword to the action plan, the minister decried “the lazy consensus” around disparity. Perhaps this was the minister attempting to engage compassionately with the 75% of Black and Black British citizens who see discrimination in their everyday lives, whether through their experiences at school, in accessing housing, at work or when engaging with public services and the criminal justice system. In the 97-page plan, the government has committed to revamping the history curriculum for schoolchildren, issuing advice to employers on how to measure and report on ethnicity pay gaps, and clamping down on online racist abuse through new legislation. There are other positive developments, including the recent establishment of the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, which could have real benefits after the disproportionate number of Covid deaths in minority ethnic communities. However, the government could have gone further to improve the parameters by which we assess racial equality, to help achieve more positive outcomes. It would have been a quick win to introduce legislation to make ethnicity pay gap reporting mandatory, as occurred with the gender pay gap in 2017. There is also the problematic issue of the government making progress on the one hand while eroding the rights of minority ethnic communities on the other, not least with a swath of planned restrictive legislation from a combination of the policing, borders and elections bills to an overhaul of the Human Rights Act. In its response to Cred, the plan says: “We do not agree with those who think that lack of opportunity should be seen solely through the prism of ethnic minority disadvantage.” It would seem politically convenient to reduce the struggles of life down to these terms, allowing the government to distract from the need to improve conditions for communities in the UK. I certainly don’t know one member of the minority ethnic working class, including my parents, who would couch their experiences in this language. Our communities are made up of individuals of different ethnicities who all share overlapping commonalities that bind us, including – in addition to class – age, gender, faith and sexual orientation. These identities impact every aspect of our lives in complex ways that move beyond a singular discussion of race. It is on this basis that for more than a decade the Runnymede Trust has been calling for all members of the working class to be offered protections under the Equality Act, regardless of their ethnicity, in acknowledgment of the vulnerabilities that exist across society. There are reasons to be optimistic about the government’s action plan. In much of the offer there is a more conciliatory and considered tone than Cred’s report – which downplayed the impact of racism on inequality and lauded Britain as “a model for other white-majority countries”. Indeed, say it quietly and call me an optimist, but on early review we may even consider the government position a discreet repudiation of some of the more divisive aspects of the Cred report – maybe it is even a calling a truce in the contrived “culture war”, at least in the context of race. In particular, the government response does not appear to make any direct reference to the term “institutional racism”. Cred’s original position on the issue was deeply flawed, with Sewell repeatedly insisting on the record that there was no evidence to support such a concept. I am acutely aware of the timing of the response, in a week in which the Royal Society for Chemistry confirmed that the field has an institutional problem with racism, and that there is only one Black chemistry professor in the entire country. And it’s the same week that a 15-year-old Black girl was reported to have been strip-searched at school by the Metropolitan police without the presence of an appropriate adult, in an incident that the authorities are clear would not have happened had the child been white. And it comes hot on the heels of the revelation that the Cabinet Office reached a six-figure settlement for racial discrimination in a bullying case at the heart of Whitehall, which the former deputy cabinet secretary Dame Helen MacNamara linked to “systemic issues” within our country’s government apparatus. The UK has made great strides towards achieving equality, but as Boris Johnson himself said when launching Cred: “It is no use just saying that we have made huge progress in tackling racism. There is much more that we need to do.” As always, I think of future generations in these moments. We owe it to them to act.

3/18/2022,"An inquiry has been launched after an apparent hoax caller claiming to be the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, was able to get through and speak directly to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace. After Wallace revealed news of the call on Thursday, Priti Patel said something similar had happened to her earlier in the week. Both government ministers expressed solidarity with Ukraine. A defence source told the Reuters news agency Wallace had ordered an immediate inquiry to find out how the apparent impostor was able to speak to him. The incident raises security questions, particularly as Wallace suggested that Russia was behind the effort. The shadow Home Office minister, Holly Lynch, said: “For individuals to be able to fraudulently gain access to two of the most senior government ministers with responsibilities for our national defence is worrying. “There are questions that need answering as to why the basics in due diligence appear not to have happened, especially at a time of heightened security concerns around disinformation and cyberattacks. “An urgent investigation must look into how this happened so the necessary steps can be taken to avoid anymore such incidents.” Wallace is not the first British minister to fall foul of a hoax call. In May 2018, Boris Johnson – then the foreign secretary – talked about international relations and rude poetry with a hoax caller who pretended to be the Armenian prime minister. And, in 2015, it emerged that the authorities had been the target of two hoax calls. In one, an impostor claiming to be the head of GCHQ Robert Hannigan managed to get through to the then prime minister David Cameron on his mobile. In the other, a caller rang GCHQ and managed to obtain Hannigan’s mobile phone number. A government spokesperson said at the time that departments had been told to be more careful and that such incidents were taken seriously. Cameron, however, seemed less disturbed, recounting the story in lighthearted fashion during a pre-election visit to the Liberal Democrat-held marginal seat of Eastleigh in Hampshire. Explaining how he had rumbled the hoax caller, he said: “My BlackBerry went in my pocket, I answered it and it claimed to be a conference call established, which I do very frequently, between the head of GCHQ and some of the staff in my office. A voice came through, a voice I didn’t recognise. The voice said that he was sorry to wake me up which I thought was strange as it was 11am.”",News/Politics,Hoax caller claiming to be Ukrainian PM got through to UK defence secretary,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/17/hoax-caller-ukrainian-pm-denys-shmyhal-uk-ben-wallace-priti-patel
3/18/2022,"Ayoung girl gets run over at the beginning of Suresh Triveni’s Jalsa, a brutal event that brings to mind Paul Haggis’s Crash, and not in a good way. Just like the painfully unsubtle Oscar winner, here a car accident and coincidences throw a group of people from different backgrounds into difficult dilemmas, forcing them to confront tough moral questions. Vidya Balan, who also stars in Triveni’s debut Tumhari Sulu, plays Maya Menon, a tough-as-nails reporter priding herself on her unwavering honesty. Her introduction suggests that the film might be a female-driven character study, as Maya is torn between her work and her disabled son. But Jalsa then changes gears dramatically, revealing that Maya is the driver behind the gruesome hit-and-run. To make matters worse, the young girl is the daughter of Maya’s trusted cook Ruksana (Shefali Shah), who has become an integral part of the family. As Maya hides her terrible secret from Ruksana, the film attempts to make some half-hearted commentary on wealth inequality as it cuts back and forth between swanky apartment condos and grimy working-class dwellings. But the critique is diluted as more characters are integrated into the already overstuffed plot, each representing a particular social stereotype: corrupt cop, obstinate trainee and so on. Like checking off items on a grocery list, Jalsa is more interested in weaving together as many pressing issues as possible, without investing any analytical attention to their causes. It’s a shame, since Jalsa could have been an effective two-hander for Balan and Shah, who are beautifully effective in the rare moments that they get to share the screen. Instead, what we have is a baffling drama that says very little about either inequality or morality.  Jalsa is released on 18 March on Amazon Prime Video.",Arts/Film,Jalsa review – hit-and-run Bollywood drama speeds past social issues,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/17/jalsa-review-hit-and-run-bollywood-drama-speeds-past-social-issues
3/18/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is already more than three weeks old, and the death toll in the bitter conflict is already likely to have exceeded 10,000. But there is also no sign of a decisive military breakthrough on either side, which could have important consequences for what is to come. On the one hand, Russia’s attack on its neighbour has been so poorly coordinated that it has left many military experts baffled. Yet while Ukraine’s defence has been exceptionally determined, it is also clear that it cannot force out the 150,000 invading troops from its territory. “The thing that has surprised onlookers is just how average the Russian military has been and how they have struggled with a complicated military operation,” said Phil Osborn, a former air marshal and chief of British defence intelligence. “If you look at the current position, Russia is struggling to maintain the tempo.” A US estimate released earlier this week suggests as many as 7,000 Russian soldiers have already died in the fighting, a tally partly confirmed by the growing number of death notices of uniformed young men appearing in Russian media. Its forces are estimated by western governments to have lost 10% of their armour. Many Russian soldiers were so poorly briefed they were surprised even to be invading Ukraine, and even more surprised to be shot at once they crossed the border. Special forces “were told it was a three-day excursion”, according to one account. So naively optimistic were Russian forces that some units dashed ahead to try to drive into Kyiv and Kharkiv, only to meet unexpected resistance. Chaotic logistics led to a vast, stalled 40-mile convoy outside Kyiv and fighting vehicles stuck in the early spring mud. But it took less than a week for the Russians to change tack. That was signalled by a cruise missile strike on the government building in the heart of Kharkiv, and has since been played out brutally in Mariupol, once a city of 450,000 people, where the past week has seen Russia bomb a maternity hospital and on Wednesday, a theatre where desperate people had been taking refuge below ground. Ukrainian officials estimated earlier this week that 2,500 civilians had been killed in Mariupol. Yet despite the fearful losses, neither it nor Kharkiv have fallen. Ukraine’s military has also lost between 2,000 and 4,000, according to the US, while the official UN estimate of civilian casualties is 780, a figure certain to rise. The first Russian forces arrived at the towns just north-west of Kyiv on the first day of the invasion, but since then they have become bogged down, failing to progress from Irpin and Bucha just outside the capital. Progress has also been stymied on the east side of the city, and western officials are beginning to question if Russia wants to fight its way through. “I think there is a question as to whether Moscow now intends to try to assault Kyiv or not, and I don’t know the answer to that,” said one on Thursday. Unlike Kharkiv or Mariupol, the capital has not been subject to heavy bombardment from the air or long-range artillery; and with three weeks to prepare the city’s defences any assault would be very costly – for both sides. Nato may not be willing to intervene by imposing a no-fly zone – a stance that has not shifted since fighting started – but western weapons have flooded into the country. On Wednesday night the US said it would send a further 9,000 anti-tank weapons and 800 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, after an appeal by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Congress on Wednesday. That has allowed Ukrainian forces to mount some ambushes of Russian tanks and armoured forces, in which light infantry have used shoulder-mounted anti-tank weapons to thwart the invaders’ advance. But Ukraine has no real answer when Russian forces turn to relentless bombing. Russian forces have also made significant gains in the south of the country, are already enforcing a naval blockade from the Black Sea, and, according to two analysts at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, are beginning to threaten Ukraine’s principal regular army formation, the Joint Forces Operation (JFO), which faces the Donbas region in the east. Sam Cranny-Evans and Sidharth Kaushal said that while Ukraine had held up the Russians in the north, the position of the JFO was “looking increasingly precarious”. Russian forces are continuing to push north from Crimea, to Beryslav along the Dnieper River, while other forces are bypassing Kharkiv and trying to join up with them as they head south. If Russian forces can succeed in encircling the Ukrainian army in the east it might, the authors argue, lead to a defeat of the country, as happened to France in 1940. “The destruction of armies tends to lead to a broader collapse of will that makes sieges unnecessary,” they said. Others argue that the broad strength of the Ukrainian resistance, the size of the country, and the course of the fighting so far demonstrate that Russia is unable to achieve a victory of conquest and occupation. “I think what we’ve learned is that Russia cannot win an outright victory – and that Ukraine cannot expel the Russians either,” said Peter Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser. As the fighting becomes increasingly attritional, peace talks between the two sides have gathered pace in the last 48 hours, with Zelenskiy offering to abandon Ukraine’s quest to join Nato and seek a neutral status along the lines of Sweden or Austria. But, Lord Ricketts argued, that “wouldn’t be nearly enough for Putin to accept, given all the mayhem and suffering that has happened so far”. Given Putin’s political need to secure a significant victory, a more likely scenario, Ricketts said, could be an uneasy halting of combat operations, and an effective repartition of the country in Russia’s favour. “It would be ceasefire on a hold-what-you-have basis, which for Russia would include the ground its forces have flattened and occupied in the south and the east. Given the military situation, I don’t see diplomacy getting to any common ground,” he said.",News/World news,Is an outright Russian military victory in Ukraine possible?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/is-an-outright-russian-military-victory-in-ukraine-possible
