12/28/2021,"An ""unruly"" passenger was taken into FBI custody after an apparent argument over face masks turned ugly on a Delta flight. The incident happened on Flight 2790 from Tampa, Florida, to Atlanta on Dec. 23. ""Situations like these are rare for the vast majority of our customers and Delta has zero tolerance for unruly behavior at our airports and aboard our aircraft,"" the airline said in a statement. Video posted on Twitter by ATL Uncensored shows a woman standing over a fellow passenger, telling him to mask up while her own mask is pulled down below her chin. ""Sit down, Karen"" the man retorts amid a slew of profanities, shouts and insults from both parties. He later holds up a water bottle, saying he is ""eating and drinking,"" when a flight attendant trying to defuse the situation tells the woman to put on her own mask. The federal mask mandate requires passengers to wear face masks on airplanes when they are not eating or drinking. ►'One of the worst displays of unruly behavior': American Airlines bans passenger after flight attendant injured ►Paying the price: 'Unruly' passengers who spit, punched and kicked at airline crew members face hefty fines The woman eventually says she'll put on her mask when the man puts on his. The situation escalates after the man calls the woman a slur. She slaps him in the face. When he says it again, she appears to spit on him, before eventually being taken away. ""This disturbance lead to the injury of fellow passengers and Delta employees,"" according to Atlanta Police who took the woman into custody once the plane landed and handed her over to the FBI, which is handling the case. The Federal Aviation Administration reported 5,114 unruly passenger incidents, as of last month, 73% of which were mask-related. More than 100 reports involved physical assaults.

12/28/2021,"The Oregon father of four who quickly rose to infamy by blurting out “Let’s Go Brandon” during a Christmas Eve call with President Joe Biden is—of course—now fully leaning into his newfound right-wing celebrity status. Jared Schmeck on Monday donned a red MAGA hat and embraced election denialism during an appearance on former Trump strategist Steve Bannon’s insurrectionist podcast. While taking calls from the NORAD “Santa tracker,” the president and First Lady Jill Biden were connected with Schmeck, a 35-year-old ex-cop now working for an electric company. After a fairly pleasant chat featuring the Bidens asking what his children wanted for Christmas, Schmeck ended the call by giddily exclaiming “Let’s Go Brandon,” a popular right-wing euphemism for “Fuck Joe Biden.” Once the moment went viral on social media and sparked outrage, however, Schmeck claimed to a local Oregon newspaper that he meant “no disrespect” and that it was merely a “joke.” At the same time, he said he was “being attacked for utilizing my freedom of speech” and had received some vaguely threatening phone calls. “I understand there is a vulgar meaning to ‘Let’s go, Brandon,’ but I’m not that simple-minded, no matter how I feel about him,” Schmeck told The Oregonian on Christmas Day. “He seems likes he’s a cordial guy. There’s no animosity or anything like that. It was merely just an innocent jest to also express my God-given right to express my frustrations in a joking manner… I love him just like I love any other brother or sister.” Two days after saying lylab to Biden and that there was “no animosity” towards him, Schmeck popped up on War Room Pandemic, the far-right podcast hosted by Bannon, the one-time Breitbart chief recently hit with contempt charges for ignoring a subpoena from the House committee probing the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. As someone who has vowed to take down “the Biden regime,” Bannon is one of the most prominent peddlers of 2020 election lies. Wearing a red “Make America Great Again” baseball cap, Schmeck first said he and his family “had a really good laugh” over his use of the phrase. However, while asserting he said it “in a joking manner,” Schmeck added that it was his chance to “voice my disapproval of this man and his administration.” Reiterating what he’s told other media outlets—that he’s a “Christian man” and he loves “God first and foremost”—Schmeck also claimed that he doesn’t “follow any one man blindly.” At the same time, the Oregon dad took issue with any reports claiming he is not a Donald Trump supporter, though he said he’s not a “Trumper” during his Oregonian interview. “That's absolutely false,” Schmeck told Bannon. “Donald Trump is my president, and he should still be president right now.” Expressing his loyalty to the twice-impeached ex-president, the ex-cop then parroted Trump’s baseless and false claims about last year’s presidential election. “The election was 100 percent stolen,” he declared. “So, I just want to make that clear.” Schmeck then proclaimed that the use of the not-so-inside joke was a way to air a number of common right-wing grievances in one fell swoop. “‘Let’s Go Brandon’ is more than just ‘F Joe Biden.’ ‘Let’s Go Brandon’ encompasses the entirety of our frustration with Joe Biden, the administration, the leftist mob, the cancel culture, the mainstream media,” he insisted. “They’re the ones who made this a thing.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

12/28/2021,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials on Monday cut isolation restrictions for Americans who catch the coronavirus from 10 to five days, and similarly shortened the time that close contacts need to quarantine. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said the guidance is in keeping with growing evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop. The decision also was driven by a recent surge in COVID-19 cases, propelled by the omicron variant. Early research suggests omicron may cause milder illnesses than earlier versions of the coronavirus. But the sheer number of people becoming infected — and therefore having to isolate or quarantine — threatens to crush the ability of hospitals, airlines and other businesses to stay open, experts say. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the country is about to see a lot of omicron cases. ""Not all of those cases are going to be severe. In fact many are going to be asymptomatic,” she told The Associated Press on Monday. “We want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science."" Last week, the agency loosened rules that previously called on health care workers to stay out of work for 10 days if they test positive. The new recommendations said workers could go back to work after seven days if they test negative and don’t have symptoms. And the agency said isolation time could be cut to five days, or even fewer, if there are severe staffing shortages. Now, the CDC is changing the isolation and quarantine guidance for the general public to be even less stringent. The guidance is not a mandate; it's a recommendation to employers and state and local officials. Last week, New York state said it would expand on the CDC's guidance for health-care workers to include employees who have other critical jobs that are facing a severe staffing shortage. It's possible other states will seek to shorten their isolation and quarantine policies, and CDC is trying to get out ahead of the shift. “It would be helpful to have uniform CDC guidance” that others could draw from, rather than a mishmash of policies, Walensky said. The CDC’s guidance on isolation and quarantine has seemed confusing to the public, and the new recommendations are “happening at a time when more people are testing positive for the first time and looking for guidance,” said Lindsay Wiley, an American University public health law expert. Nevertheless, the guidance continues to be complex. ISOLATION The isolation rules are for people who are infected. They are the same for people who are unvaccinated, partly vaccinated, fully vaccinated or boosted. They say: —The clock starts the day you test positive. —An infected person should go into isolations for five days, instead of the previously recommended 10. —At the end of five days, if you have no symptoms, you can return to normal activities but must wear a mask everywhere — even at home around others — for at least five more days. —If you still have symptoms after isolating for five days, stay home until you feel better and then start your five days of wearing a mask at all times. QUARANTINE The quarantine rules are for people who were in close contact with an infected person but not infected themselves. For quarantine, the clock starts the day someone is alerted to they may have been exposed to the virus. Previously, the CDC said people who were not fully vaccinated and who came in close contact with an infected person should stay home for at least 10 days. Now the agency is saying only people who got booster shots can skip quarantine if they wear masks in all settings for at least 10 days. That’s a change. Previously, people who were fully vaccinated — which the CDC has defined as having two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — could be exempt from quarantine. Now, people who got their initial shots but not boosters are in the same situation as those who are partly vaccinated or are not vaccinated at all: They can stop quarantine after five days if they wear masks in all settings for five days afterward. FIVE DAYS Suspending both isolation and quarantine after five days is not without risk. A lot of people get tested when they first feel symptoms, but many Americans get tested for others reasons, like to see if they can visit family or for work. That means a positive test result may not reveal exactly when a person was infected or give a clear picture of when they are most contagious, experts say. When people get infected, the risk of spread drops substantially after five days, but it does not disappear for everyone, said Dr. Aaron Glatt, a New York physician who is a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “If you decrease it to five days, you're still going to small but significant number of people who are contagious,” he said. That's why wearing masks is a critical part of the CDC guidance, Walensky said. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

12/28/2021,"“I have never hated anyone more than Donald Trump!” So wrote the Flat Rock Letter-to-the-Editor writer to this newspaper last spring. Hate is such horrible thing and yet I’ve come to believe it was the root of last year’s presidential election and why we now have Joe Biden as president. Before going further, let me agree with Trump-haters that Donald Trump is a narcissistic, egotistical bully and despite my support for his policies, I’m almost glad he’s out of our everyday life. I didn’t vote for a Sunday school teacher for president; I voted for a businessman, not another empty-promising career politician like we’ve been used to and have now. As I’ve shared, I’m somewhat of a conspiracy theorist and have always been wary of a government still assuring us nearly 60 years later that Lee Harvey Oswald killed President Kennedy. I wondered how could the man responsible for - the greatest economy in my lifetime, the lowest unemployment in a half-century (and lowest black unemployment ever), record stock market highs, stood up to China by imposing tariffs, made America energy independent by turning us into the world’s number one producer of oil and natural gas - lose to one that virtually stayed hidden away in his basement and did no campaigning? The same guy who launched Operation Warp Speed to fast-track Corona virus vaccinations and who Biden criticized then for restricting travel from pandemic infected regions of the world, the same thing he would behest last week for Omicron control. How could American voters watch a sitting vice president brag on video of executing a Ukrainian quid pro quo (to kill an investigation of his son) and then turn around and celebrate Trump’s impeachment for simply suggesting the same? I could go on. I’ve happily stayed out of the political arena since the election but this column has been stewing in my mind and I thank Jussie Smollett for bringing it to print. I remember being outraged the evening Michigan Rep. Rashida Talib was sworn in to Congress (and before Donald Trump ever served a day in the White House). In her comments she recanted telling her son, “We’re gonna impeach the mother---ker.” And liberals were upset with Trump’s verbiage? Then the main stream media – specifically CBS, NBC, ABC, MSNBC and CNN – methodically trashed Trump EVERY day for the next four years. No matter what he did, they criticized him daily. Then came Jussie Smollett, the actor recently convicted of lying about staging a racist, homophobic hate-crime attack on himself. Smollett claimed two white Trump supporters wearing MAGA hats attacked him, called him the “N” word and hung a noose around his neck. I watched Jussie’s Oscar performance for Good Morning America’s Morning Show Host, Robin Roberts, who opened ABC’s prime time arms for the charade. I guess the opportunity to slam Trump (and beat the other networks to the story) was just too juicy to take time to investigate the veracity of his story. Biden blamed homophobic, racist America and promised, “We are with you Jussie!” Vice President Harris called it a “modern day lynching” and media bought it hook, line and sinker. Why? Because they WANTED it to be true. That’s when I realized we don’t have Joe Biden as president because he is a great leader and best for America; we have him because of how much people hated Donald Trump. As mentioned, Trump is surely annoying and his own worst enemy, but that doesn’t change how angry I am after paying $3.35 yesterday at the pump when one year ago on election eve I paid $1.67. And why did Biden shutter the Alaska Pipeline so now we’re back to buying oil from Arab nations that hate us? Are higher oil prices his way of shoving electric cars down our throats? Today, natural gas - up 113%, heating oil - up 60%, new cars - 9%, used cars - 26%, eggs - 12 %, bacon - 20%. Should I go on? Probably not, because I expect your wallet is taking the same hit as mine. Joe now wants to counter the highest inflation in 50 years by spending trillions more for Build Back Better. But don’t worry, it won’t cost you a penny as he’ll make billionaires pay without raising prices, and if you believe that I expect you are as dumb as he thinks you are. But, what do I know.
