4/5/2022,"Several Russian influencers and socialites claim they've been barred from purchasing Chanel goods. One influencer accused the fashion house of ""Russophobia"" for not allowing her to shop at a Dubai outlet. Another socialite said some Russian shoppers have been able to pull strings to get their hands on luxury goods. Several Russian influencers and socialites have claimed that they were barred from purchasing Chanel items and were told that it was the brand's policy not to sell its products to Russian customers. Anna Kalashnikova, a Russian socialite and influencer, posted on her Instagram on Sunday accusing Chanel of ""Russophobia in action."" She claimed that she had not been able to buy a pair of earrings and a bag at a Chanel outlet in Dubai. ""Since I often come to Dubai for Fashion Week, Chanel managers recognized me, approached me, and said: 'We know that you are a celebrity in Russia, we know that you will take your purchases there, so we cannot sell you our brand items,'"" said Kalashnikova in her post. She said that the experience reminded her of how ""Coco Chanel was not only mistress of a Nazi"" but that she was a fascist agent. ""The actions of her legacy, her brand make you think about the biography of Coco Chanel. Supporting fascism and Russophobia is so low,"" Kalashnikova said. Meanwhile, Russian interior designer and influencer Liza Litvin posted an Instagram story — seen by Fortune and the Daily Mail — detailing her similar experience of not being allowed to purchase Chanel items in Dubai. In the post, Litvin claimed she had to sign a document at a Chanel outlet declaring that she did not live in Russia and that she would not wear the bag on Russian soil. ""I went to a Chanel boutique in the Mall of the Emirates. They didn't sell me the bag because (attention!) I am from Russia!"" wrote Litvin in the post, per Fortune. Meanwhile, Ukrainian socialite Snezhanna Georgieva said that some Russian shoppers have managed to find back doors to negotiate the purchasing of Chanel items, per The New York Post. ""I will love it when these brands are back,"" Georgieva said. ""But we know some boutiques that are still open when a regular customer calls them."" Representatives for Chanel did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider. However, the brand's policy appears to fall in line with a European Union ban on the export of luxury items to Russia in the wake of the war in Ukraine. On Friday, pro-Kremlin tabloid Pravda ran a rebuttal to Chanel's stance from Maria Zakharova, a representative from the Russian Foreign Ministry, who accused the brand of supporting Nazism by not selling products to Russian customers. ""We just opened a closet, from which 80-year-old skeletons that had not yet decayed had fallen out,"" read Zakharova's statement on Chanel. ""We are a very patient and forgiving country. We have forgiven everyone for everything, we have turned the page and made way for the future. However, if this way is a ring road, we will break this vicious circle."" Vogue Business reported on March 4 that luxury stores in Russia were seeing a three-fold increase in shoppers, with people ""trying to buy as much as possible while they can still afford it."" Several days later, luxury brands like Burberry, Chanel, Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Prada, and Kering announced the temporary closures of their stores in Russia.

4/5/2022,"Ukrainian resistance to Putin's invasion led him to go ""insane,"" a former Russian oligarch said. Mikhail Khodorkovsky told CNN that Putin expected to be met with ""flowers"" in Ukraine. ""It not only just angered him, I really think it drove him literally insane,"" Khodorkovsky said. An exiled Russian oligarch said Putin went ""insane"" after he anticipated that the people of Ukraine would ""meet him with flowers"" when he invaded the country. ""At first, what he wanted was to change the power in Kyiv, put in his puppet, and was expecting that this would be met with flowers thrown in the streets by Ukrainian people,"" Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former CEO of the Russian oil giant Yukos, told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday. Khodorkovsky — who was once the richest man in Russia, and was imprisoned for nine years on charges of fraud and tax evasion until his release in 2013 — has been an outspoken critic of Putin. He has said his imprisonment was politically motivated. He told Zakaria that when Ukrainians resisted the invasion, Putin went crazy. ""The fact that the people in Kharkiv did not meet him with flowers, it not only just angered him, I really think it drove him literally insane. That's when he started bombing Kharkiv and Kyiv,"" Khodorkovsky said. Khodorkovsky said Putin has three ways out of this crisis: continue to pressure Ukraine, use weapons of mass destruction to force Ukrainians to retreat, or start ""actual"" negotiations. Last month the exiled oligarch said the war in Ukraine would lead to Putin's downfall. ""I'm convinced that Putin hasn't got much time left. Maybe a year, maybe three,"" he told CNN. On Saturday, former Russian Deputy Energy minister Vladimir Milov told CNN's Erin Burnett top officials in the Russian government are ""personally devastated"" by Putin's aggression in Ukraine, adding it was only a matter of months before Putin lost his grasp on power.

4/5/2022,"KALUGA, Russia (Reuters) - Thousands of auto workers have been furloughed and food prices are soaring as Western sanctions pummel the small Russian city of Kaluga and its flagship foreign carmakers, with more sanctions likely to come. The Kaluga region, 190 kilometres (120 miles) southwest of Moscow, says it has attracted more than 1.3 trillion roubles ($15 billion) in investment, mostly foreign, since 2006. But Western sanctions imposed in recent weeks over Russia's invasion of Ukraine have exacerbated lingering component shortages and halted production at two flagship car plants, Germany's Volkswagen and Sweden's Volvo. A third, the PSMA Rus plant that is a joint venture between Stellantis and Mitsubishi and employs 2,000, may halt production soon due to a lack of parts, Stellantis' chief executive said last Thursday. ""It is not clear what will happen. They don't give us any concrete information,"" said Pavel Terpugov, a welder at the PSMA Rus plant. Terpugov said he needs twice as much money to buy groceries than before the sanctions. Analysts have forecast Russian inflation could soar to 24% this year, while the economy may shrink to 2009 levels. The hardships of the Russian people are a far cry from the devastation the war has caused Ukrainians. International outrage spread on Monday over civilian killings in northern Ukraine, where a mass grave was found in Bucha, outside Kyiv. The deaths are likely to galvanise the United States and Europe into additional sanctions against Moscow. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" and the Kremlin categorically denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha. One source of hope for some in Kaluga, with its 325,000 residents, is the West may be reluctant to hurt its own companies. ""Does it make sense to impose sanctions on its own plant and lose money?"" said Valery Uglov, an auto mechanic at the Volkswagen plant. ""Does it make sense to lose the Russian market?"" ""We hope to return to work as soon as possible and everyone will have confidence in the future again,"" Uglov said. Volkswagen, whose factory employs 4,200 people, in early March suspended operations due to the war. A spokeswoman said production remained frozen. Volvo Group, which employs over 600 people to build trucks, also suspended production. Even before the sanctions, Russian car sales had contracted from 2.8 million units from when the Volkswagen factory opened in 2007 to 1.67 million units last year, damaged by both sanctions after the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the COVID-19 pandemic. Some factories cut output last year due to disruptions caused by the pandemic. ""We have had similar furloughs at the factory... but now, of course, the situation is different, more serious,"" said Alexander Netesov, a warehouse foreman at the Volkswagen plant. ""But we are waiting anyway, we are not losing hope,"" he said. In a sign of the squeeze workers are feeling, Netesov said a new Polo car he ordered with a factory discount had increased in price by 20% since his pre-order. Others in the city, which also boasts production by pharmaceutical and food companies as well as Samsung televisions, derive optimism from the fact that almost every crisis that has ravaged the Russian economy over the past two decades has been followed by a boom. ""I hope, we all hope, that in the near future everything will stabilize,"" said Angelina Minnigulova, a marketing executive at Volkswagen dealer KorsGroup, which has seen a fall in demand as car prices soar.

4/5/2022,"A video posted by the former world champion boxer Wladimir Klitschko shows bodies in Bucha, Ukraine. ""They've been shot in the head, with tied hands behind their back,"" he says. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klitschko have both accused Russia of genocide. Wladimir Klitschko, the Ukrainian former world heavyweight champion boxer, called the mass killings of civilians in Bucha, Ukraine, ""genocide"" in a video posted on Twitter on Sunday. Klitschko, who is fighting in Ukraine's capital, posted graphic footage from Bucha, a town on Kyiv's outskirts, showing bodies of people he said were innocent civilians. ""I'm in the city of Bucha, on the outskirts of the capital. What happened here — and everywhere in Ukraine what is happening — this is not a special operation, this is not military objects, this is civilians,"" Klitschko says in the footage. Klitschko then pans to the bodies on the ground. Blood can be seen under them. ""They've been shot in the head, with tied hands behind their back,"" Klitschko continues. ""This is genocide of the Ukrainian population, and that's exactly what the Russian regime, Putin's regime, Russian army, is doing, killing civilians with tied hands behind their back and with a shot in their heads."" You can see the graphic video below: Klitschko's sentiment echoed that of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who in an interview with CBS on Sunday accused Russia of war crimes and genocide. ""Indeed, this is genocide,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The elimination of the whole nation and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have over 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities."" Zelenskyy also posted photos on Telegram on Sunday showing dead bodies in Bucha. ""Mothers of Russian soldiers should see that. See what bastards you've raised. Murderers, looters, butchers,"" he said alongside the photos. Bucha's mayor, Anatoly Fedoruk, said over the weekend that nearly 300 people had been buried in mass graves in the town, according to Agence France-Presse. According to a CNN report, Fedoruk also told Reuters: ""Corpses of executed people still line the Yabluska street in Bucha. Their hands are tied behind their backs with white 'civilian' rags, they were shot in the back of their heads. So you can imagine what kind of lawlessness they perpetrated here.""
