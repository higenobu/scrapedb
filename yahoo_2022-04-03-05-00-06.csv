4/3/2022,"A former Russian official told CNN that Russia's elite will begin to question Putin's leadership. Vladimir Milov said officials are already concerned about Putin's aggression in Ukraine. Milov said officials are monitored and are afraid to communicate with each other about the policies. A former Russian deputy energy minister who is now an adviser to opposition leader Alexy Navalny said Russian President Vladimir Putin's time in office is numbered. Vladimir Milov told CNN's Erin Burnett on Saturday that top officials in the Russian government are ""personally devastated"" by Putin's aggression in Ukraine. ""For the first time ever, we are moving in a backwards direction. We had a lot of difficulties in the 70s, and the 80s, and the 90s, but we were still somewhat opening to the world and the direction was very different,"" Milov said. ""Now Russia is being disconnected from global markets, global financial architecture, technology, logistics, and so on."" Milov said this disconnection isn't something that's happened before and those in positions of power recognize that. ""So, when I say devastated, I mean it,"" Milov said. In a March 18, op-ed in the Journal of Democracy, Milov wrote that Putin's ""days are numbered."" He told Burnett on Saturday, that Putin still maintains a strong grip on power but most likely not for long. ""He can hang on for some time, but few weeks, months, down the road, many more people inside the system will begin questioning what he's doing, ordinary Russians will express discontent with deteriorating economic situation, huge losses in the war. This is something Putin never experienced,"" Milov said. Milov said Russian elites will start questioning the direction of the country and if Putin is the right leader. Right now, however, he said communication between government officials is monitored significantly, possibly even greater than surveillance of opposition. Opponents are afraid to speak up about Putin's policies in Ukraine. ""If like two people, three people, or more will start to discuss that Putin is taking the country in the wrong direction, this is with large certain going to be recorded and reported to Putin,"" Milov said.

4/3/2022,"The U.S. and allies will work together to transfer Soviet-made tanks to Ukrainian forces for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, The New York Times reported Friday. A U.S. official told the Times the tanks will enable Ukraine's military to conduct long-range artillery strikes on Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, suggesting that self-propelled artillery vehicles — which bear some resemblance to tanks — are also being sent. The official was unable to say how many tanks were being sent or which allies would be providing them. Ukrainian troops already know how to operate Soviet-made vehicles. A $300 million military aid package the U.S. announced Friday also includes ""armored off-road vehicles"" for Ukraine's military, NBC News reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been persistent in imploring NATO to help Ukraine neutralize Russia's advantage in the air — whether by implementing a no-fly zone or by sending Ukraine fighter jets — but has also asked for armored ground vehicles. Last week, he asked NATO for ""1 percent"" of the alliance's tanks and aircraft and said Ukrainian forces did not have ""a sufficient number of tanks, other armored vehicles, and ... aircraft"" to ""break the blockade in Mariupol."" Ukraine launched several successful counterattacks that recaptured territory around Kyiv late last month. Zelensky's comments suggest that, armed with additional tanks, Ukrainian forces could carry their counteroffensive even farther.

4/3/2022,"A repeat offender accused of punching, kicking and flinging a Filipino man against a wall during a Manhattan robbery earlier this week has not been charged with assault, according to reports.

Rasheed Osundairo, 30, reportedly attacked his victim at a McDonald’s self-serve kiosk on Seventh Avenue at around 7:40 a.m. on Monday. Security footage shows him fleeing the scene after taking the man’s phone and wallet.

The victim, identified as 53-year-old Melvin Dizon, suffered a severe head injury and was taken to Bellevue Hospital in critical but stable condition.

Speaking to the New York Daily News from his hospital bed, Dizon claimed that no one tried to help him: “I was hoping people were going to help me, but they didn’t… they were just watching and they didn’t get involved. I guess they’re scared.”

The incident marked the second anti-Filipino attack in Manhattan in two days. On Tuesday, the Philippine Consulate General in New York issued a warning for Filipino residents and called on authorities to “do more” to ensure public safety.
 


Osundairo was arrested on Tuesday after an off-duty police officer recognized him on the subway. He was charged with robbery.

Despite reportedly beating up his victim, however, Osundairo has not been charged with assault. The incident is also not being investigated as a hate crime.

Police sources noted that Osundairo has nearly two dozen prior run-ins with the authorities. He was paroled in December 2016 after being sent to prison for an attempted robbery.

In one prior incident, Osundairo allegedly bit the tip of a teenager’s nose off inside a Queens deli and then attempted to eat it. Police said the teenager was trying to defend his mother, who was being hit by Osundairo with a stick.

After Tuesday’s arrest, Osundairo was charged with assault for another incident that occurred on the subway on March 23. He was also charged with criminal possession of stolen property for the items that police found on him during his Tuesday arrest.

Osundairo was reportedly undergoing psychiatric evaluation as of Wednesday. Enjoy this content?

4/3/2022,"As Moscow's forces bog down in Ukraine, many young Russians of draft age are increasingly jittery about the prospect of being sent into combat. Making those fears particularly acute is an annual spring conscription that begins Friday and aims to round up 134,500 men for a one-year tour of military duty. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu pledged at a meeting of the military brass this week that the new recruits won't be sent to front lines or “hot spots.” But the statement was met with skepticism by many in Russia who remember the separatist wars in the southern republic of Chechnya in the 1990s and early 2000s, when thousands of poorly trained young men were killed. “I don't trust them when they say they won't send conscripts into combat. They lie all the time,” said Vladislav, a 22-year-old who is completing his studies and fears he could face the draft immediately after graduation. He asked that his last name not be used, fearing reprisals. All Russian men aged 18-27 must serve one year in the military, but a large share avoid the draft for health reasons or deferments granted to university students. The share of men who avoid the draft is particularly big in Moscow and other major cities. Even as President Vladimir Putin and his officials say that conscripts aren’t involved in what Russian authorities call “the special military operation in Ukraine,” many appeared to have been taken prisoner during its initial days. Videos emerged from Ukraine of captured Russians, some being shown calling their parents, and were put on social media. The mother of one of the prisoners said she recognized her 20-year-old draftee son in a video even though he was shown blindfolded. “I recognized him by his lips, by his chin. You know, I would have recognized him by his fingers,” said the woman, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Lyubov, for security reasons. ""I breastfed him. I raised him.” The Defense Ministry was forced to walk back its statements and acknowledge that some conscripts were sent to Ukraine “by mistake” and were taken prisoner while serving with a supply unit away from the front. There have been allegations that before the invasion, some conscripts were forced to sign military contracts that allowed them to be sent into combat — duty that is normally reserved only for volunteers in the army. Some of the captured soldiers said they were told by their commanding officers that they were going to a military exercise but suddenly found themselves fighting in Ukraine. Lyudmila Narusova, a member of the upper house of the Russian parliament, spoke in early March about an entire company of 100 men who were forced to sign such contracts and were sent into the combat zone — and only four survived. Military officials did not comment on her allegation. Svetlana Agapitova, the human rights commissioner in St. Petersburg, said Wednesday that relatives of seven soldiers had written to her to complain the men had been forced to sign the contract and sent to Ukraine against their will. She said two of them already had been brought back to Russia. In recent years, the Kremlin has emphasized increasing the share of volunteer contract soldiers as it sought to modernize the army and improve its readiness. The force of 1 million now has over 400,000 contract soldiers, including 147,000 in the infantry. If the war drags on, those numbers could be insufficient to sustain the operations. The Kremlin could eventually face a choice: Keep fighting with a limited number of troops and see the offensive stall, or try to replenish the ranks with a broader draft and risk public outrage that could fuel anti-draft sentiment and destabilize the political situation. Such a scenario occurred during the fighting in Chechnya. Dmitry, a 25-year-old IT expert, has a deferment that should keep him out of the draft for medical reasons. But he's still nervous like many others, fearing authorities could abruptly waive some deferments to bolster the military. “I hate the war. I think it's a total disaster,” said Dmitry, who also asked that he not be identified by has last name, fearing reprisals. “I fear that the government could change the rules and I could face the draft. They also were saying for months that they wouldn’t attack Ukraine, so why should I trust what they say about the draft now?” Proposed legislation would facilitate the draft by allowing military recruiters to call up conscripts more easily, but the bill has been put on hold for now. Still, it added to the public’s anxiety. Alexei Tabalov, a lawyer who advises conscripts, said medical panels at recruitment offices often admit youths who should be exempt from service because of illness. Now, he added, their attitudes could grow even tougher. “It's quite probable that doctors may shut their eyes to conscripts' illnesses and declare them fit for military duty,” Tabalov said. In addition to lowering the medical standard for draftees, there are fears that the government could try to impose some sort of martial law that would ban Russian men from leaving the country and, like Ukraine, force them to fight. “We have received a lot of calls from people fearing mobilization,” Tabalov said. “People now are afraid of everything in this situation. No one even thought before about the need to analyze the law on mobilization.” The Kremlin has strongly denied any such plans, and military officials insist the army has enough contract soldiers to serve in Ukraine. Still, many Russians remain skeptical of the officials' denials, given their track record. “What kind of trust could there be if Putin says one day that conscripts will not be sent there ... and then the Defense Ministry recognizes that they were there?” Tabalov asked. An existing law allows for a 21-month alternative civil service in hospitals, nursing homes and other facilities for those who view military duty as incompatible with their beliefs, but military conscription offices often broadly ignore requests for such service. After the war began, Tabalov said his group saw a large increase in inquiries about the alternative service law, which is vaguely phrased and allows military officials to easily turn down applications. “We are worried that in the current militarist mood, military conscription offices can take a tougher attitude and reject appeals for the alternative civil service,” he said. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,War in Ukraine fuels fears among draft-age Russian youths,https://news.yahoo.com/war-ukraine-fuels-fears-among-061506028.html
