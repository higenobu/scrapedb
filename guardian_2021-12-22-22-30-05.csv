12/22/2021,"South Africa has reported new data on Covid cases driven by the Omicron variant that appears to give added impetus to claims the country is seeing a lower severity of disease. “In South Africa, this is the epidemiology: Omicron is behaving in a way that is less severe,” said Prof Cheryl Cohen of the country’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), one of the authors of the new study.  “Compellingly, together our data really suggest a positive story of a reduced severity of Omicron compared to other variants,” she said during a news conference by a group of NICD scientists on Wednesday. Scientists, however, cautioned that the reasons less severe cases were being seen was not fully understood and that South Africa’s experience – with a young population – might not translate into how other countries experience Omicron. In South Africa the median age is 27.6 years in comparison with the UK where it is 40.5 years and Italy – hard hit by the first wave of the pandemic – where it is 47.3. “The lower risk or lower proportions of severe disease we’re seeing in the fourth wave could be due to a number of factors including the level of prior immunity from people who’ve already gotten vaccinated or had natural infection, or it could also be due to the intrinsic virulence of Omicron,” said Dr Waasila Jassat, of the NICD. “But we need more studies to be able to unpack these things,” she said. The question of immunity from vaccination or prior infection was flagged as a potential contributory factor last week by researchers at the University of Cape Town in a symposium of the World Health Organization after work that suggested that some of the body’s defences against Omicron – in particular so-called killer T-cells – may remain robust. While evidence from South Africa about the virulence of the Omicron variant is being studied around the world – including in the UK – the NICD’s Michelle Groome warned that the South African data could not necessarily be extrapolated to other countries with different population profiles. Much of the interest in the past fortnight in South Africa’s experience of Omicron, where the variant was first identified, has been driven by reports from public and private hospitals and health providers that has suggested lower levels of hospitalisation, admission to ICUs and use of oxygen for patients. Against the more optimistic claims that the fourth wave of Covid in South Africa might be less severe, in the past week there has been an uptick, so far small, in hospitalisations and deaths in South Africa’s hospitals. The claims about virulence came as some South African experts were claiming a “sustained drop” of new Covid cases. From nearly 27,000 new cases nationwide on Thursday, the numbers dropped to about 15,424 on Tuesday, although those claims may still be premature and also influenced by other statistical factors. Marta Nunes, a senior researcher at the vaccines and infectious diseases analytics department of the University of Witwatersrand, told Associated Press: “The drop in new cases nationally combined with the sustained drop in new cases seen here in Gauteng province, which for weeks has been the centre of this wave, indicates that we are past the peak.” “It was a short wave … and the good news is that it was not very severe in terms of hospitalisations and deaths,” she said. It was “not unexpected in epidemiology that a very steep increase, like what we saw in November, is followed by a steep decrease”.",News/World news,Data appears to support claims that Omicron is less severe in South Africa,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/data-appears-to-support-claims-that-omicron-is-less-severe-in-south-africa
12/22/2021,"So much new composition seems to make connections between contemporary minimalism and early music. Narrow Sea sees Pulitzer prize-winning composer Shaw create a very American variety of antique minimalism, featuring opera soprano Dawn Upshaw. The ancient folk song Wayfaring Stranger and other Sacred Harp hymns are placed in a disorientating sonic environment, with Gilbert Kalish providing discordant piano and the New York ensemble Sō Percussion switching between Steve Reich-ish marimbas and atmospheric effects on ceramic pots, water bowls and dulcimers.  Robert Ames, founder of the London Contemporary Orchestra, is a crucial connector in modern music, the arranger and conductor linking Jonny Greenwood, Frank Ocean, Little Simz, Jónsi and Actress with contemporary minimalists. His solo debut Change Ringing features six meditative, drone-based pieces, but the highlights are Tympanum and Rounds, where Ames’s slow-motion, multilayered approach gets more microtonal and harmonically complex. Bristol’s intriguing Spindle Ensemble feature composer and pianist Daniel Inzani backed by vibes, violin and cello. Their second LP showcases some compelling Philip Glass-style minimalism but also pushes into Morricone-esque exotica, Japanese-inflected country and western and Satie-ish romanticism. The Bandcamp page of KMRU – a sound artist based between Berlin and Nairobi, AKA Joseph Kamaru – is always worth checking out for ambient textures. Logue, the third of five mini-albums he released this year, is an addictive mix of meditative electronica, slow-motion synth-pop and bucolic field recordings from east Africa. Gazelle Twin’s 2018 album Pastoral was a febrile journey into the heart of middle England, mixing menacing folk chants, thuggish techno and satirical lyrics, with vocalist, composer and producer Elizabeth Bernholz serving as a retro-futurist court jester. Deep England sees her collaborating with the six-piece drone choir NYX to turn the album’s themes into drumless, paganistic a cappella soundscapes, filled with eerie pitch-shifted vocals, mouth percussion, microtonal harmonies and endless layers of reverb. Read the full review. This Japanese singer, songwriter and guitarist is best known for her wonderfully wayward take on bossa nova, but her first collaboration with pianist and composer Taro Umebayashi is a marked change in direction. Beautifully played and sung, it is a soundtrack to an imaginary film; a dreamlike conceptual voyage through the East China Sea; and a piece of orchestral music that slyly references Erik Satie, Philip Glass, Astrud Gilberto and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan while maintaining a unique artistic vision. The latest by this Sacramento duo is a fascinating addition to the burgeoning genre of ambient Americana. It reassembles the defining sonic tropes of American roots music (woozy pedal steel, slurring fiddles, brushed drums and reverb-drenched electric guitar) as disembodied sounds put through an ambient filter. Where so much electronica conjures up concrete brutalism, this suggests huge skies and dust-dry roads; it’s the sound of Harold Budd, Dick Dale and Pat Metheny melting in the Mojave sun. Read the full review. The third proper album by the Manchester duo is a truly immersive voyage – 19 tracks of manipulated field recordings, synth drones, haunted bass lines and barely there breakbeats. The spoken-word tracks have a certain Mancunian swagger but most of the record comprises icy, futuristic instrumentals which seem to distil the most ominous sonic implications of dubstep and drill without using any beats at all. Best known for their punky, London-accented folk music, this LP sees the Walthamstow duo draw from their background in experimental electronica to provide a psychogeographic voyage through the capital. Anglo-Saxon poems are recast as sludge metal; ancient cockney nursery rhymes become sinister pieces of digital minimalism; urban field recordings are turned into terrifying pieces of musique concrète. This is music that draws from 1,000 years of history, fed through a portal into a dystopian future. Promises is a remarkable three-way collaboration that is simultaneously an orchestral suite, a piece of free improvisation and a groundbreaking electronic masterpiece. Yet none of those definitions really do it justice: this is a haunting piece of sound art that slowly seduces you over its 47-minute duration, using drones, frictionless modal jazz improvisations and a constantly mutating baroque harpsichord riff, all the time slowing down your perceptions of time and space.

12/22/2021,"Alan Bennett’s yearly diary excerpt sees the playwright dedicating Rudyard Kipling’s poem A Dead Statesman, in which the narrator proclaims that “all my lies are proved untrue / And I must face the men I slew”, to Boris Johnson. Bennett’s annual chronicling of his life, published on Wednesday by the London Review of Books, moves from his problems getting a haircut in February – his partner Rupert Thomas takes on the task in lockdown and “manages to make me look like a blond Hitler” – to politics.  In March, he criticises how “with his customary foresight and good judgment, one of the first acts of the current prime minister was to hasten to the side of President Trump”, and how the former speaker John Bercow was the one to rule out Trump addressing parliament in 2017. “His reward was to be refused the customary peerage on retirement by the prime minister, who happily doled out peerages to umpteen millionaires, all of them donors to the Tory party. And so we go on,” writes Bennett. By 30 May, Bennett is reduced to simply writing out the whole of Kipling’s poignant A Dead Statesman, noting that it is “a poem for Boris”. “I could not dig: I dared not rob: / Therefore I lied to please the mob. / Now all my lies are proved untrue / And I must face the men I slew. / What tale shall serve me here among / Mine angry and defrauded young?” writes Kipling in the extract from Epitaphs of the War. Reading Rory Stewart’s account of his time in Iraq, Occupational Hazards, causes Bennett to note in September that “it is hard to imagine this man, however briefly, as MP for Penrith and a contender with Boris Johnson, but on this evidence alone he would have been a sounder dealer with our intractabilities and a more honest one”. Bennett also takes time to chronicle his reading habits – in particular Blake Bailey’s Philip Roth biography, which was later dropped by its publisher over allegations of sexual assault. “It’s a fucking big book, which I actually fell over yesterday on my birthday,” he notes in May, also writing about his own unexpected mention in the biography, when he meets Roth at a dinner in the 1960s. Bennett’s own “recollections of the evening are more embarrassing”, he says. “Talking to Jonathan [Miller] beforehand, I had made a poor joke about Portnoy’s Complaint being The Gripes of Roth,” he remembers. “I’m sure I wasn’t the first to pick up on this, but it was new to Jonathan, so when Roth arrived he insisted on telling it to its subject. Maybe he even insisted on me repeating it myself. I’ve no memory of Roth’s response – unamused, I would have thought – but remember my own embarrassment, as fresh now with Roth dead as it was 50 years ago.” The diary is published in the London Review of Books’ 1,001st issue. Mary-Kay Wilmers, who had edited the magazine for almost 30 years, founding it in 1979 along with Karl Miller and Susannah Clapp, stepped down from her role in January. “In the early days I would get cross because Karl Miller tried to take out my jokes, often through not understanding them,” remarked Bennett of the LRB’s history. “He seldom gave a verdict on the piece, so you were never sure you’d come up to scratch.”",Arts/Books,Alan Bennett dedicates Kipling poem A Dead Statesman to Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/22/alan-bennett-dedicates-kipling-poem-a-dead-statesman-to-boris-johnson
12/22/2021,"People with inflammatory bowel disease have 50% more microplastics in their faeces, a study has revealed. Previous research has shown that microplastics can cause intestinal inflammation and other gut problems in laboratory animals, but the research is the first to investigate potential effects on humans. The scientists found 42 microplastic pieces per gram in dried samples from people with IBD and 28 pieces in those from healthy people.  The concentration of microplastics was also higher for those with more severe IBD, suggesting a connection between the two. However, the study does not prove a causal link, and the scientists said further research must be done. It may be that IBD causes people to retain more microplastics in their guts, for example. Microplastic pollution has contaminated the entire planet, from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. People were already known to consume the tiny particles via food and water as well as breathing them in. Microplastics are known to harm wildlife but very little is known about their impact on people’s health, although a study published earlier in December found they damaged human cells in the laboratory. The study, published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, analysed samples from 50 healthy people and 52 people with IBD, but otherwise healthy. The participants were from across China and also completed a questionnaire including information on their dietary and drinking habits in the previous year. As well as the link to IBD, the scientists found that people who tended to drink bottled water or eat takeaway food had about double the concentration of microplastics in their stools. In total, 15 different types of plastic were found among the microplastics. The most common were PET, used on water bottles and food containers and polyamide, which is also found in food packaging. The level of microplastics in the faeces was similar to those in the few previous studies conducted, once differences in methodology are taken into account. One study found infants had more microplastics than adults in their faeces. This may be due to infants chewing plastic items or use of milk bottles which are known to shed millions of microplastics. Diet and environmental factors can trigger or exacerbate IBD, which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. “In recent years, the prevalence of IBD has sharply increased in developing countries in Asia,” said the researchers from Nanjing University in China. “It is estimated that there will be 1.5 million IBD patients in China by 2025 which will cause a serious disease burden.” “This study provides evidence that we are indeed ingesting microplastics,” said Evangelos Danopoulos at Hull York Medical school in the UK, who was not part of the study team. “It is an important study, as it widens the evidence base for human exposures. More data about possible confounding factors is needed to build a causal association to specific human health conditions.”",News/Society,"Microplastics may be linked to inflammatory bowel disease, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/22/microplastics-may-be-linked-to-inflammatory-bowel-disease-study-finds
12/22/2021,"Government advisers have decided against recommending that all five- to 11-year-olds be offered the Covid vaccine, with only the most vulnerable children expected to be eligible immediately, the Guardian understands. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is expected to recommend a limited rollout to clinically vulnerable children on Wednesday, stopping short of suggesting that all primary age children should be vaccinated.  Ministers have been keenly awaiting the advice on primary age vaccinations, with large numbers of children absent throughout the autumn term as the Delta and then Omicron waves spread through the unvaccinated population. It is understood that one complication for a wider rollout of the vaccine among younger children is how best to administer the smaller doses needed. The JCVI recommended in September, just as children returned to school after the summer break, that 12- to 15-year-olds should be given one dose of the vaccine. It recently suggested they should receive a second dose. There was some frustration in government that the JCVI’s experts could not have reached a consensus on vaccinating secondary school children earlier, allowing a rollout to begin during the holidays. Some scientists have been calling for an across-the-board rollout to children to help keep schools open in January and minimise disruption to teaching. Deepti Gurdasani, clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, told the Guardian earlier this month that schooling would “not be feasible” next year without extending the vaccination programme to primary school-age groups. “There’s been no discussion of how we’re going to protect children in January when schools reopen,” she said. “The US has vaccinated 5 million children. The EMA [European Medicines Agency] has approved, FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] has approved, there’s no word from the MHRA [the UK regulator] which is quite stunning.” However, some medical experts have concerns about the legitimacy of vaccinating children – who tend to experience Covid as a very mild illness – in order to protect the wider population. The UK’s caution on vaccinating younger children contrasts with the US, where regulator the FDA recommended jabbing five- to 11-year-olds in late October – though with lower doses than those given to older patients. The JCVI’s announcement, which is expected to be confirmed later on Wednesday, comes as the government wrestles with how best to respond to the rapid increase of Omicron cases. Boris Johnson has said no further restrictions will be imposed before Christmas though he has urged families to take precautions including lateral flow testing and increased ventilation. Contingency plans have been drawn up for stringent curbs to be implemented after Christmas – potentially including limits on social mixing – but no decision has yet been made, and ministers have continued to say they do not yet have adequate data to make a final decision.",News/Society,JCVI set to recommend vaccinating only vulnerable five- to 11-year-olds,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/22/jcvi-set-to-recommend-vaccinating-vulnerable-five--to-11-year-olds
12/22/2021,"The Kremlin has denied using Russia’s gas resources to turn the screw on Europe, after gas in a pipeline to Germany switched direction to flow eastwards for a second day, keeping prices near record highs as midwinter approaches. Flows through the Yamal-Europe pipeline to Germany declined over the weekend before stopping on Tuesday and reversing, data from the network operator Gascade showed.  Gazprom, the Russian state gas firm, said the supply was flowing to Russia instead because of cold weather and high demand there. The front-month wholesale Dutch gas price, the benchmark for European prices, rose more than 20% on Tuesday to close at a record high of €181 per megawatt hour (MWh). The equivalent British gas contract also jumped by about 20% on Tuesday, to hit a new peak at £4.51 per therm, up from around 51p a year ago. Prices dipped on Wednesday but remained high. The price of gas for delivery in Europe next month fell 3% to €175 per MWh, and the British front-month contract eased to £4.17 per therm. Some analysts and European politicians have suggested that Moscow is deliberately suppressing gas deliveries to shore up its political position amid tensions over Ukraine and delays in European certification of another pipeline, Nord Stream 2. The Kremlin denied using such tactics. “There is absolutely no connection [to Nord Stream 2], this is a purely commercial situation,” a spokesperson said. The German power suppliers RWE and Uniper, both among the largest customers of Gazprom, said the state firm was meeting its delivery obligations. Gazprom has previously said it is meeting all long-term contracts with its European customers The pipeline reversal has added to other pressures that have kept gas prices high for much of 2021, with knock-on effects that have included a raft of UK energy suppliers going bust. Underlying factors fuelling the fresh spikes include colder weather and strong power station demand, with some French nuclear plants closed to address safety concerns. Also, wind speeds have been slower than usual in Europe, meaning turbines have generated less electricity than hoped for. Ships carrying liquefied natural gas bound for Asia have been turning around to supply European consumers willing to pay a large premium amid price spikes, the Financial Times reported this week.",News/Business,Kremlin denies restricting gas supplies to Europe for political gain,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/22/kremlin-denies-restricting-gas-supplies-europe-political-gain-pipeline-russia
