5/17/2022,"The UK’s hottest day of the year so far is expected on Tuesday, with spells of sunshine across the country and temperatures forecast to rise to 26 degrees in London offering an early glimpse of summer. The Met Office said the hottest temperatures would be in south-east England as a plume of warm air arrives from the continent, although much of the country will have warm weather. The temperatures are expected to break the record set so far this year of 23.6C recorded in Faversham, Kent on 6 May. Average highs for the south of England in May are 17 degrees, although Met Office spokesperson Ollie Claydon said temperatures in the late-20s were not unusual, especially towards the end of the month. He added the forecast did not constitute a heatwave, which the Met Office defines as three successive days of temperatures above 28 degrees. However, not all regions will see blue skies. A band of rain is passing across Northern Ireland, where temperatures will reach about 14 degrees in Belfast and will become more widespread and heavier across the west and then the north, bringing winds and a cooler feel. In south-east England, the good weather is set to continue on Wednesday, with fresher temperatures and some showers arriving on Thursday, bringing temperatures down to the early 20s over the weekend. Most parts of the UK will have above-average temperatures for May over the week, but blue skies will be broken up with potentially heavy or thundery showers, especially in the north and west.Claydon said the outlook for next week remained “borderline” as high pressure was looking to make its way in to the UK over the weekend, but it was unclear whether it would succeed.Towards the end of May, the Met Office is predicting lots of fine and dry weather, with near-average temperatures and more summery spells in the east and south-east.NHS hot weather advice recommends that people stay cool indoors, stay hydrated, keep out of the sun between 11am and 3pm, apply sunscreen regularly and avoid exercising in the hottest parts of the day.",News/UK news,UK set for hottest day of 2022 so far as temperatures to hit 26C,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/17/uk-set-for-hottest-day-of-2022-so-far-as-temperatures-to-hit-26c
5/17/2022,"When she moved from Melbourne to Sydney, Siobhan O’Sullivan did not consider what it would mean for the way she died. But since being diagnosed with terminal ovarian cancer mid-2020, the 48-year-old thinks about that decision a lot. “To think that if I had have remained in Melbourne, that I could have access to voluntary assisted dying is horrible,” she told the Guardian. “But my support networks are here, my family’s here, so for me to relocate is impractical. I shouldn’t have to do that either.” O’Sullivan is among a chorus of voices hoping their long campaign to legalise voluntary assisted dying comes to a close this week after a debate and vote in the New South Wales upper house. Siobhan O’Sullivan has ovarian cancer and she’s urging the government to pass the voluntary assisted dying bill so people like her don’t have to suffer in their final days. #nswpol pic.twitter.com/pN1KsMhgXj If passed, NSW will become the last state in the country to allow terminally sick people to choose when they die. While opponents of the bill have proposed dozens of amendments, including changes to access for terminally ill people in aged care, supporters and campaigners remain hopeful and willing to work with anyone who still has genuine concerns. But the independent MP for Sydney, Alex Greenwich, who introduced the bill in 2020, said some of the proposals that had been put forward this week were cruel, noting there had already been an extensive debate in the lower house where many of the issues had been dealt with. “All of a sudden we’re seeing amendments to deny access to people to voluntary assisted dying in their home if their home is in aged care … that is cruel and unnecessary,” he said. He and the Labor MLC Adam Searle, who has carriage of the bill in the upper house, said they were confident they had a blocking majority and that there was general consensus to deal with the matter this week. The founder of advocacy group Go Gentle Australia, Andrew Denton, said NSW needed to act to bring the rights of people in the state into line with people living elsewhere. “(This) is the last parliamentary chamber in the last state in Australia to consider legalising voluntary assisted dying,” Denton said. “The people of this state don’t die any differently to other Australians.” He spoke alongside Cathy Barry, who has campaigned for assisted dying after her brother Tom died a slow and painful death from a facial tumour. She wants to see the law pass so that no one else has to go through what he and his family had to. “He died in excruciating pain and it was a prolonged period of terrible suffering,” Barry said. “Just as my brother begged for mercy when he was dying, I’m now begging the members of the upper house of NSW parliament … to vote on and pass that legislation.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Earlier in the day, the deputy leader of the NSW Nationals, Bronnie Taylor, said there was no excuse for deliberately hostile amendments and called for the bill to be passed as is. “The community has spoken on this issue,” Taylor told Nine. “There is no reason to delay it any more.” The bill passed the lower house last year with 53 votes to 36 after dozens of emotive speeches from serving politicians. The bill will need to return to the lower house for a final vote if amendments are accepted, which could happen as early as Wednesday.

5/17/2022,"Inspired by the Crossed comic book series, this enigmatically titled gorefest directed by Rob Jabbaz is perhaps the bleakest cinematic response yet to the pandemic. As a mysterious virus descends upon an overcrowded Taipei filled with crammed apartments and packed subway cars, the infected morph into rabid monsters who are slaves to their basest instincts. Sweeping through the city like a crimson wave, gruesome acts of violence – including stabbings, sexual assaults and cannibalism – are made even more horrifying by their sheer randomness. The dam of civilisation is broken, and the darkness of humanity oozes through the cracks like a festering wound. In the age of “elevated horror” where the roots of dread often function as a metaphor for intangibles – such as emotional trauma – or social issues, it is refreshing when terror takes on a more immediate, visceral form, like someone thrusting the tip of an umbrella into an eye socket. There is a loose narrative thread here as a pair of young lovers struggle to communicate with each other amid the carnage, though their tragic separation serves more as an excuse for the film to revel in increasingly sadistic set pieces with astonishing inventiveness. Unencumbered by a need to explicitly spell out any overarching message (a noble aspiration that nevertheless dampens many modern horror films) The Sadness accentuates gore’s tactile yuckiness, utilising practical effects in a fashion that recalls retro exploitation flicks. A castration sequence sees bits of flesh visibly flying about the screen, a stylistic flourish that is at once tongue-in-cheek and genuinely revolting. The recurring dependence on sexual violence as a shock tactic is, however, a desensitising misstep. Nevertheless the assured command of style situates Jabbaz as an impressive new voice in horror cinema.  The Sadness is available now on Shudder.",Arts/Film,The Sadness review – unapologetically yucky gorefest turns into pandemic allegory,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/17/the-sadness-review-pandemic-allegory-gore
5/17/2022,"Last week, Dr Maya Bass, a family physician, was on a call with the medical director of Trust Women, one of four abortion clinics in Oklahoma. They were scrambling to figure out how to keep their doors open after the leak of a draft opinion signaling the supreme court’s intent to overturn Roe v Wade and the Oklahoma governor’s signing of SB1503 into law, banning abortions in the state after six weeks of pregnancy. “With my colleagues, there’s a lot of anger,” Bass says. “As a medical professional, it’s really hard to spend your life studying to become an expert in a certain area and then have a politician with no medical expertise and not even a uterus take away your power to offer patients safe medical care.” About once a month since 2017, Bass has traveled from her home in Camden, New Jersey, to moonlight at Trust Women Oklahoma City to help mitigate the shortage of abortion providers in the middle of the country. The tiny clinic’s staff had been stretched to its limit since September, when neighboring Texas banned abortions past six weeks of pregnancy, forcing an estimated 6,000 Texans to travel to Oklahoma. But Oklahoma will no longer be a refuge for Texan patients. A near copycat of the Texas law, Oklahoma’s new ban would allow any private citizen to sue any individual – doctors, nurses, pharmacists – who “aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion” after signs of fetal cardiac activity. And in the aftermath of a Roe reversal, Oklahoma is one of 13 states that would immediately ban almost all abortions. “The staff is exhausted,” says Bass. “They’re amazing and resilient and are probably some of the most creative humans I’ve ever met, in that they’ve been figuring out with every new legal hurdle different plans to serve as many people as possible. ‘How can we legally care for patients with a 72-hour waiting period and a six-week ban? How can we pull this off?’” They considered options for fighting back. Perhaps they could best serve patients by offering consultations and pre-screenings in their Oklahoma City clinic, then sending them to their sister clinic in Wichita, Kansas, a two-and-a-half hour drive away, for the abortion procedure itself – but would that somehow put them at risk of being prosecuted for “aiding and abetting” an abortion? Would that implicate the Wichita clinic? Would Oklahoma City staffers be able to serve more patients if they moved to Kansas to practice there? After her call with the medical director, Bass cancelled her next trip, which would have been in June. Trust Women Oklahoma City – which receives some 500 calls a day – has put a temporary hold on new appointments. “Patients were too nervous to schedule with us,” Bass says. “We couldn’t promise we’d actually be able to see them.” The facility is now referring patients to Wichita. Appointments for the Kansas clinic are all currently full. “Pregnancy is hard,” Bass says. “You’re tired and nauseous. People have hyperemesis – they continually vomit. Mental health disorders tend to get worse, especially during an undesired pregnancy. There are so many stories of people coming in being like, ‘I can’t function, I can’t do my job, I’ve taken too many sick days.’” After an abortion, negative pregnancy side effects subside. But trigger laws that require patients to travel out of state to access care force more patients to stay pregnant longer. “That’s an extra four weeks of suffering,” Bass says. “And that is definitely something that will worsen because even if a person has resources, the clinics that exist after Roe falls will see bigger volumes and wait periods.” For doctors around the country, the struggles of patients and providers in Texas and Oklahoma offer a glimpse of what’s to come after the likely fall of Roe. “I feel sad and I feel tired and I feel angry and incredibly motivated,” said Dr Katherine Farris, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic in Raleigh, North Carolina. “It’s stunning and gut-wrenching, but we’re not surprised. We’ve been planning for it.” In so-called sanctuary states like North Carolina, that planning largely revolves around figuring out how already overwhelmed clinics can serve even bigger waves of abortion “refugees”. Even with efforts to bolster staffing, clinics expect increased wait times, which will force more patients to carry pregnancies past the limit for medication abortion, leading to a demand for more second-trimester procedural abortions. “So the people who say they’re so upset by later pregnancy abortions are creating a scenario where more will occur,” Farris says. In a landscape rife with misinformation and stigma, where Googling “how to get an abortion” often turns up misleading ads for anti-abortion “crisis pregnancy centers”, providers are preparing to educate more patients about options for safe and affordable reproductive healthcare. Even if Trust Women Oklahoma City is completely barred from providing abortions in-house, they plan to stay open, offering informational consultations and other reproductive healthcare services. “Our patients need us as resource guides more than ever now,” Bass says. “If someone calls me, it’s not enough for me to say, ‘Here’s a number for the nearest clinic.’ I need to say, ‘Here’s the clinic, here’s the number for an abortion fund in this area if you have money issues, here’s the free hotline for emotional consultations.’ Healthcare providers need to serve our patients now by giving them clear resources, websites with up-to-date information.” Preparing for a post-Roe America also means providers are figuring out how to legally and ethically counsel patients on how to safely self-source and self-manage abortions. In a pre-Roe landscape, before the advent of abortion pills, self-managing posed serious risks of injury or death. But now, “because of medication abortion, there are safe ways to manage at home”, Bass says. “I’m hoping more providers recognize the safety of [self-managed medication abortions] so we can support our patients through that.” Patients may self-manage through other means, such as contacting the loose underground networks of women trained to provide safe at-home abortions outside the law, using devices such as manual vacuum aspirators made from mason jars, or herbal abortifacients, such as pennyroyal tea or black cohosh. “I have friends in the more natural, herbal world talking about going back to the old days of using different herbs,” Farris says. “Other patients will go back to physical attempted inductions. And those will be dangerous.” Even as they plan how best to handle this latest blow to reproductive health, these doctors expect their efforts won’t be enough to stem the devastation of a Roe reversal. Providers are increasingly forced into interactions with patients that feel crude and absurd. “I’ve had patients sitting in front of me sobbing, saying, ‘Please, please, I need you to do this today,’ but they didn’t get their 72-hour consent,” Farris says, referring to time mandated by states between counseling and getting an abortion. “Or their 72-hour consent time isn’t up for five more hours, and I have to say, ‘I’m sorry, I need you to wait five more hours before I hand you your pill in order to be in compliance with the law.’” She says she has to explain to patients that though it breaks her heart, she can’t make exceptions because it would jeopardize her being able to treat thousands of other women who need her care every year. She knows her work will continue to be sought out, likely with increasing desperation and a dire outlook. Research suggests that a total abortion ban would lead to a 21% increase in pregnancy-related deaths. “There is going to be a lot of forced birth. People’s lives are going to be devastated by this. People are going to be emotionally and financially traumatized. People’s futures are going to be derailed,” Farris says. “I will be stunned if people don’t die. And it should not come down to people dying for us to reconsider autonomy.”",News/US news,‘A lot of forced birth’: abortion providers’ predictions for a post-Roe America ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/17/abortion-providers-post-roe-v-wade
5/17/2022,"Violence and arrests will not deter Sudan’s young activists from resisting the military who “stole our revolution”, says one man who faces down the teargas and bullets in a blue and red superhero costume. Featured in a new Guardian documentary, “the ‘Spider-Man’ of Sudan”, who cannot be named for his safety, has become a symbol of protests that began in October. Dressed in his increasingly frayed suit and mask he and other demonstrators confront teargas canisters, water cannon and often live bullets. During the protests his childhood friend was killed by security forces, who have also been accused of sexually assaulting women and hunting down activists. It was as a homage to his friend that he picked up the suit, less as a disguise than as a symbol of both his loss and the account they heard as children, of the spider who protects the Prophet Muhammed and his companion by spinning a web across the mouth of a cave they are hiding in, meaning their enemies pass by without looking in. “Spidey” was among hundreds of thousands of people whose protests in 2019 led to the fall of dictator Omar al-Bashir and the creation of a transitional government, which was itself ousted in a military coup in October 2021. “The military and counter-revolutionary parties, they stole Sudan’s revolution. They are like the former government of 30 years – there’s no difference between them and [Bashir’s] National Congress party,” he said. “They are dictators and they want only control.” Spidey was filmed as he took part in the protests, as well as in his other role as a self-taught scientist who teaches robotics to young children. At a secret meeting of a resistance committee coordinating localised actions around Sudan, Spidey and his fellow activists spoke of how they felt united with Sudanese people in their goal to overthrow the military, regardless of the violence used against them. “The night comes and the night goes, every day is like this,” Spidey said. “With the will of God, we still come out. Until today we continue to try to liberate the country but we have no fear. The people of Sudan, all of them, will continue to face the security forces and their bullets.” At least 95 people have been killed in the protests since October, according to the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, a pro-reform group which has also warned about the increased use of shotguns on the crowds by security forces, causing high numbers of casualties. According to film-maker Phil Cox, Spidey has become a representation of the atmosphere in the country. His distinctive suit seems to energise protesters around him and symbolises the resistance, while his teaching work was galvanised by the 2019 movement, like many other social and cultural activities. “It was pretty amazing what people were doing – digital start-ups, creative collectives – but they’re now under threat and being closed down by the military,” said Cox. After the revolution in 2019 was overturned, he said, many of those young activists became angry and distrustful of people in power, including international negotiators. “They feel the attention has drifted and they’re on their own and they’re absolutely not backing down … they trusted, they tried and they think the international community will let them down again.”",News/Global development,The ‘Spider-Man’ of Sudan: masked activist becomes symbol of resistance,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/17/the-spider-man-of-sudan-masked-activist-becomes-symbol-of-resistance-documentary
5/17/2022,"Growing numbers of refugees are being made homeless, and in many cases destitute, after relationship breakdowns with their Homes for Ukraine hosts in the UK, community organisations have said. Some predict the system could crash entirely after reports of Ukrainian refugees being asked to leave the homes of their sponsors with only one day’s notice, leaving them with no option but to be referred to local authorities as homeless or, if they can afford to, attempt to seek last-minute rented accommodation. Community leaders said such incidents were happening among typically well-meaning hosts who may have failed to anticipate the enormity of the commitment until refugees arrived in their homes, adding to the stress and trauma of the newcomers. Other factors cited include costs, personality and cultural clashes, hosts not setting house rules, misunderstandings and communication problems. Iryna Terlecky, a board member of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, said: “Our community is seeing these cases frequently and our perception is that they’re increasing.” They also report similar issues among those who arrived on the Ukraine family scheme – either caused by space problems or relationship breakdowns. “We are finding that sponsorship relationships are breaking down – in spite of the very clear desire of people to help,” Terlecky said. A 43-year-old Ukrainian woman told the Guardian she was left homeless, terrified and not knowing where to turn after being asked to leave by her Homes for Ukraine hosts after little more than a week. After Russia’s invasion she fled her 22nd-floor flat in Kyiv for Spain but she found it difficult to find work. She met her UK hosts, a couple from Exeter, on Facebook who arranged her flights and documentation. At first, she said, they all got on well and she felt “loved and cared for”. But their dynamic shifted dramatically when she went to visit a man she had met online. Her hosts have accused her of lying. “It’s a terrible feeling,” she said, speaking from emergency council accommodation in a hotel. “You feel really happy, loved and cared for and then you feel like you’ve been thrown from a high-rise building to the ground.” Meanwhile, the Local Government Association said there had been a “concerning increase” in Ukrainian arrivals presenting as homeless, and it urgently called for a rematching process so refugees were not left in limbo. Government sources told the Observer they were working on a “rematching” service. Marta Mulyak, who has hosted several Ukrainian families since the start of the war and is chair of 1st London Plast, a Ukrainian Scout group, said: “A lot of people say, ‘Of course I can give a room to a Ukrainian’. But then bills, cost of food – people maybe don’t think about that until they have come.” Many newly arrived refugees are still experiencing the trauma of having lived in a war zone. Mulyak has seen children fall to the floor after mistaking a loud noise for a bomb. “The Homes for Ukraine scheme has a lot of problems and eventually will lead to a total crash,” she said. Anya Abdulakh, from Families4Peace, a charity helping Ukrainians in north London, said she was recently contacted by a woman who came to the UK with her daughter to live with a woman she met on Facebook. But when they arrived, the host was going through a divorce and it transpired that she was a strict vegetarian who did not want meat in the house – leading to tension. “The situation now is that she [the host] wants her to move as quickly as possible,” she said. Sara Nathan, the co-founder of Refugees at Home, expects the problems with the scheme to “stay quite acute for some time” – especially once placements hit six months, the minimum time hosts must commit to. A Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: “We do not recognise these claims – more than 46,100 people have arrived through both Ukraine schemes and the vast majority of these are settling in well. “There are stringent safeguarding measures in place for the Homes for Ukraine scheme and, according to council data reports, very few of these sponsorships are breaking down. Where they do, councils are able to provide support or find a more suitable sponsor.”",News/UK news,"Homes for Ukraine: refugees being left homeless, UK community groups warn",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/17/homes-for-ukraine-refugees-being-left-homeless-uk
5/17/2022,"Good morning. The white gunman accused of the massacre of 10 Black people at a Buffalo supermarket wrote as far back as November about staging a livestreamed attack on African Americans. He also practised shooting from his car and traveled hours to scout out the store in March, according to diary entries he appears to have posted online. The diary includes tallies of the number of Black people he counted there. It came to light two days after 18-year-old Payton Gendron allegedly opened fire with an AR-15-style rifle at the Tops Friendly Market. He was wearing a helmet camera to livestream the shootings on the internet, authorities said. Meanwhile, a shooting at an Orange county church on Sunday left southern California reeling when a gunman motivated by hate for Taiwanese people fired on congregants who managed to put a stop to the bloodshed. Authorities on Monday identified the suspect, who is accused of killing one person and wounding five others at the Geneva Presbyterian church, as David Chou of Las Vegas. Police said the motive of the shooting was a grievance between Chou, identified as a Chinese immigrant, and the Taiwanese community. What’s happening to Gendron? He surrendered and was arraigned on a murder charge over the weekend. He pleaded not guilty and was jailed under a suicide watch. Federal authorities are contemplating bringing hate crime charges. How about Chou? He is expected to appear in state court today and it was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. A federal hate crime investigation is also ongoing. The satellite and drone imagery from above Bilohorivka tells a tale of folly and destruction. Dozens of Russian tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and trucks lay destroyed, some sinking into the waters of the Donets River by a broken pontoon bridge, pointing to the latest disaster in Russia’s three-month war in Ukraine. The toll of Russia’s attempts to cross the river, part of its costly offensive in the east, is staggering: more than 485 killed and up to 80 vehicles destroyed, according to one estimate, although no numbers of casualties have been confirmed. As Russia continues to hide the scale of its losses in Ukraine, more information has been leaked, angering the families of Russian soldiers and discouraging even previous supporters of the invasion, write Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer. “I look at my government totally different since the war started,” said Tatyana Efremenko, 39, whose son Nikita Efremenko was a conscript on the Moskva missile cruiser when it was sunk in a Ukrainian missile strike one month ago.

More than 260 Ukrainian soldiers, many of them wounded, have finally been evacuated from the besieged Azovstal steel plant, appearing to cede control of the city to Russia after 82 days of bombardment. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 83 of the invasion. The US’s most powerful pro-Israel lobby group is pouring millions of dollars into influencing Democratic congressional primary races to counter growing support for the Palestinian cause within the party, including elections today in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s money is focused on blocking female candidates who, if elected, are likely to align with “the squad” of progressive members of congress who have been critical of Israel. But it is funneled through a group, the United Democracy Project (UDP), that avoids mention of its creation by Aipac and seeks to decide elections by funding campaign messages about issues other than Israel. The UDP has thrown $2.3m into Tuesday’s Democratic primary race for an open congressional seat in Pennsylvania – one of a handful of contests targeted by the group where a leading candidate is overtly sympathetic to the Palestinians. How has the money been spent? The money has mostly been spent in support of a former Republican congressional staffer turned Democrat, Steve Irwin, in an attempt to block a progressive state representative, Summer Lee. As Democrats have denounced the supreme court’s provisional decision to overturn Roe and vowed to defend abortion rights, their efforts at the federal level have largely failed to live up to their rhetoric.

The top Catholic clergyman in the Holy Land has condemned the Israeli police beating of mourners carrying the casket of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh, accusing the authorities of violating human rights and disrespecting the Catholic church. “As children, we are generally taught not to talk to strangers or to stare at other people. And I know that most people are capable of following these norms because that is what I experienced as an adult before my transition.

That is 25 years of global emissions at today’s rate – the world’s scientists agree emissions must fall by half by 2030.

5/17/2022,"Ricky Gardiner, the guitarist who performed classic riffs for albums including David Bowie’s Low and Iggy Pop’s Lust for Life, has died aged 73. Producer Tony Visconti announced the news on social media, saying Gardiner’s wife had informed him. He described Gardiner, who had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, as a “guitar genius”. Born in Edinburgh in 1948, his first major band was the prog rock group Beggars Opera, who formed in 1969. Beginning with Act One the following year, he recorded six albums with the band, who became a cult favourite across Europe, particularly in Germany. He was invited to play guitar on Tony Visconti’s solo album Inventory, and Visconti suggested that he perform on David Bowie’s Low – Bowie then invited him to join the recording sessions at a chateau near Paris, in 1977, later moving to Hansa studios in Berlin. Gardiner played lead guitar on the album’s first half, including the cheerful, whimsical lead line on Sound and Vision, the fanfare-like riff for opening track Speed of Life, and the cosmic solo on Always Crashing in the Same Car. The Bowie recordings brought him into the orbit of another star, Iggy Pop, and he toured with Bowie and Pop for the latter’s album The Idiot, with Bowie on keyboards. On this famously debauched tour, Gardiner preferred to take early morning walks – “If others used [drugs], they must have been discreet. I enjoy the occasional drink but I would be quite happy if alcohol was returned to its rightful place in the laboratory,” he later said. He then played guitar and contributed songwriting on the Bowie-produced Iggy Pop album Lust for Life later in 1977, describing the writing and recording sessions as “a joy”. Among Gardiner’s contributions is a riff regarded to be one of the simplest and greatest of all time: the swaggering three-note motif for The Passenger, which came to him in bucolic surroundings not usually associated with Pop. “The apple trees were in bloom and I was doodling on the guitar as I gazed at the trees,” Gardiner later said. “I was not paying any attention to what I was playing. I was in a light dream enjoying the glorious spring morning. At a certain point my ear caught the chord sequence.” He also co-wrote the songs Success and Neighbourhood Threat, and played drums on the closing jam Fall in Love With Me. “Lust for Life benefited from a lot of spontaneity and was largely recorded as the moon was waxing towards full,” he later explained. “The song Success epitomises this jubilant energy and the album on the whole shows imaginative qualities consistent with this rising lunar energy.” Iggy Pop paid tribute to Gardiner, writing: “Dearest Ricky, lovely, lovely man, shirtless in your coveralls, nicest guy who ever played guitar.” Gardiner became a father and didn’t continue to tour with Bowie and Pop. He set up his own studio and began exploring the possibilities of digital production, occasionally releasing albums with collaborators – including his wife Virginia Scott – such as the ambient project Kumara. In 1995, he released Auschwitz, an instrumental work marking the 50th anniversary of the camp’s liberation that he regarded as his most important solo work.

5/17/2022,"Countries must urgently agree a way of controlling and regulating attempts to geoengineer the climate, and consider whether to set a moratorium on such efforts, as the danger of global heating exceeding the 1.5C threshold increases, the former head of the World Trade Organisation has warned. Pascal Lamy, a former director general of the WTO and a former EU trade commissioner, now president of the Paris Peace Forum, said governments were increasingly likely to explore the possibilities of geoengineering, as efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions have so far been inadequate. “Given where we are, we have to seriously consider the risk of overshooting 1.5C,” said Lamy. “That is a huge risk. All of the ways by which we can alleviate this risk must be evaluated. I think a global effort on geoengineering could work.” At present, there is little to stop a government experimenting with geoengineering. “There should be ways of stopping countries from doing this alone,” Lamy told the Guardian. “We should look at all options, including a moratorium.” But Lamy said the likelihood of an individual billionaire, such as Elon Musk, attempting to geoengineer the climate without government involvement was still remote. “I don’t think that is a danger. I think Elon Musk would need some kind of authority [from governments],” he said. “I don’t think he could try to do it alone. You need government clearance to send up a rocket, even.” Geoengineering would involve trying to change the temperature or climate on Earth through methods such as whitening clouds, or injecting sulphur particles into the atmosphere to reflect more sunlight, or spreading iron in the ocean to absorb carbon dioxide. Ideas such as launching a giant sunshade into space have also been suggested, along with more prosaic options including painting roofs white. None of these possibilities have yet been tried, and some could be dangerous: for instance, spraying sulphur could cause acidification of the seas, cloud whitening could change rainfall patterns and deflecting the sun’s rays could cause crops to fail. But Lamy said the world had to examine such methods, as countries were failing to cut greenhouse gases fast enough. “It is tragic that we have to consider this [geoengineering]. Because we know we are not on the right path to avoid overshooting 1.5C,” he said. Scientists warned this month there was a 50:50 chance of global average temperatures rising to more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels within the next five years. If the earth’s temperatures exceed 1.5C consistently, drastic and in some cases irreversible changes to the climate will follow, including melting of the ice caps, floods, droughts, heatwaves and sea level rises. Some methods of geoengineering could be cheap, Lamy added. “Some could be economically rather cheap, whereas we know that carbon capture and storage is something very costly.” Lamy said the science behind geoengineering required careful investigation, but his concern is directed towards how any such attempts would be governed at an international level. Some forms of weather manipulation have already been tried: for instance, cloud-seeding to provoke rainfall has been used in China. Lamy, as president of the Paris Peace Forum thinktank, is leading a new initiative to establish potential governance structures for geoengineering. He has convened a panel of 16 global experts, called the Global Overshoot Commission. They will consider recommendations on how geoengineering can be governed, both within existing international structures such as the UN, and the potential need for new governance bodies. The commission will produce a report, probably consisting of a series of principles to be observed, that will be presented to governments in 2023, before the Cop28 UN climate summit. It will have no legal standing, but is intended to inform government thinking. As well as geoengineering, the commission will consider ways of helping countries to adapt to the ravages of the climate crisis, the potential for new technologies such as carbon capture and storage, and ways of “repairing” the climate to reduce temperatures after they have breached the 1.5C limit.",News/Environment,"Geoengineering must be regulated if used to cut emissions, says former WTO head",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/17/climate-geoengineering-must-be-regulated-says-former-wto-head

5/17/2022,"Melbourne’s CBD population – and the number of parking tickets – is set to boom under projections by the city’s council, but the peak property industry group has warned that more needs to be done to get people back into offices. The City of Melbourne’s draft 2022-23 budget papers, handed down on Tuesday, reveal expected revenue is forecast to increase by 13% to $538.7m, but the number of businesses operating in the CBD is projected to fall by more than 10%. The CBD’s population is expected to swell to 54,738 – up from 37,112 forecast in last year’s budget. The Property Council of Australia has warned the push to boost city office workers cannot rely on government incentives indefinitely. The number of CBD businesses is forecast to fall, from a projected 9,444 that was contained in last year’s budget, to 8,230 in the next financial year, with business owners struggling amid the city’s lagging office occupancy rate. The Property Council of Australia’s Victorian head, Danni Hunter, said Melbourne’s business sector, city council and state government had to unite to encourage people “to make working in the office the choice they want to make”. “We absolutely have to focus on our office community. That’s the real gap in the increase in the activity we’ve seen in recent months that has been driven by event activation and amazing hospitality incentives like Melbourne Money,” Hunter said. “We have to put a renewed focus on encouraging and incentivising people to come back to the office, and that can’t rely on government incentives for ever.” According to the budget papers, there is “an expected increase in CBD activity and visitation as revenue recovers to post Covid levels” next financial year. As a result, the budget has forecast a 64% increase in revenue – amounting to a $15.9m rise – from parking fines, and a $9m increase in parking fee income. Earlier this month, the council and state opposition had criticised the Andrews government’s state budget for its lack of CBD recovery funding. At 36%, Melbourne’s office occupancy lags behind the rest of Australia, with Sydney slightly ahead at 42%. Adelaide leads the nation at 59%, followed by Brisbane at 51%. After two years of rates relief to ease pressures during the pandemic, council will implement a 1.75 % increase to align with the state government’s cap. Rates revenue alone is forecast to be $345.6m – up 6% from the past financial year. Melbourne’s lord mayor, Sally Capp, said the budget aimed to bring people back to the city. “We’ve designed a budget that delivers on what matters most – making our city cleaner, delivering more events and bringing people back to the city,” Capp said. “We’re investing to grow our economy beyond pre-pandemic levels and create more jobs, more events and more amenities for our residents, traders and visitors.” Hunter said the budget struck the right balance between a “modest rate increase” and investments in city precincts like the $300m Greenline project – which has $40m allocated in the council’s budget – and $25m for “activation” events like festivals. “It’s so critically important for bringing people back into the city,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Hunter said the property council was excited to see momentum building around the Greenline project. Federal Labor has committed to investing $20m into the Greenline project – that will create a 4km promenade along the Yarra River – if it wins the federal election on Saturday. “Greenline is an amazing place-making opportunity for Melbourne – bringing a bit of New York to Melbourne and keeping Melbourne on the global map while making great use of one of our most important assets – the Yarra River,” she said. “It’ll be very important in the post-Covid economy recovery that our focus on projects and precincts is really front and centre.”",News/Australia news,Concerns for businesses despite expected rise in Melbourne CBD’s population ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/concerns-for-businesses-despite-expected-rise-in-melbourne-cbds-population
