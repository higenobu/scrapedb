2/13/2022,"As news of the latest grim White House briefing on Ukraine broke late on Friday evening in Kyiv, the bars and restaurants were as full as on any other Friday night, the atmosphere remained jovial, and anyone without access to a Twitter feed would have struggled to divine any sense of foreboding. While US officials and the Washington journalists briefed by them prophesied a “horrific, bloody” campaign to be launched against Ukraine imminently, nobody except journalists was paying much attention to what, to many in Kyiv, seems like just the latest in a line of apocalyptic briefings.  As the staff at Washington thinktanks wrote of a ruthless campaign to be launched this weekend – one that would deprive Ukraine of power and heating, and take out the top command of the army – the streets of Kyiv, where light snow fell, felt like a parallel reality. Of course, underneath the surface calm, many Ukrainians are making contingency plans, some to fight off an invasion, others to flee for safer places. It is not possible to buy an electricity generator in the city, and many discuss what they would do if the worst does happen. Cellars, metro stations and even strip clubs have been mooted as possible bomb shelters in the event of a Russian air attack. On Saturday, thousands of Ukrainians rallied in central Kyiv for a “unity march”, waving Ukrainian flags and banners reading “We will resist” and “Invaders must die”. However, the crowd of several thousand was small by the standards of a city used to giant protests, and reflects a weariness at the constant, nagging threat of war. “Putin is making a huge mistake if he thinks he will be able to destroy Ukraine,” said Andriy Tyshko, on the march with his infant daughter. Iryna Kuprienko, who was out for a stroll near the protest, said she did not understand the fuss. “We know Putin is capable of doing terrible things but surely even he is not mad enough to try to bomb Kyiv.” As more embassies announced the evacuation of most diplomatic staff and told their citizens they should leave now or be prepared to get stuck, the increasing tension is getting harder to ignore. American citizens in Kyiv received calls on Friday evening from concerned consular staff, telling them to make plans to leave immediately. But for many people here, the idea of a full-fledged invasion remains something outlandish and implausible. Many Ukrainians, up to and including the president, say they are well aware of the risk Russia poses but do not quite believe the American insistence that the threat is imminent. “I’m beginning to get pretty annoyed with this,” said one former Ukrainian MP, who asked not to be named. “I am very pro-western, but the way this invasion news is coming out reminds me of [unverified rumours on] Russian Telegram channels, about unnamed sources and backroom information. “The media hysteria is extremely annoying, and you start to lose trust in your own government, which is just telling us to keep calm.”",News/World news,Ukrainians in Kyiv shrug off threat of Russian invasion ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/13/ukrainians-in-kyiv-shrug-off-threat-of-russian-invasion
2/13/2022,"Cabaret opens with a Nazi getting kicked out of the Kit Kat Klub, a Berlin nightspot catering to the prurient whims of a well-heeled audience in 1931. It ends with the entire club populated by Nazis, as if it were under occupation. In between, the show goes on with minor changes to accommodate a different clientele, and the country, too, slips inexorably into darkness, engulfing characters who are powerless to stop it, even if they’re inclined to do so. It is an utterly bone-chilling movie musical, yet seductive, witty and delightful – an unbearable lightness of being.  The contradictory tensions of Cabaret are managed with such deftness by director Bob Fosse that it remains, 50 years later, a rare film that feels like only one person could have pulled it off. How people continue to live their lives in the face of encroaching authoritarianism and violence is an endlessly renewable and relevant subject for movies, but Fosse choreographs the foreground and background of historic change with as much care as he brings to the song-and-dance at the Kit Kat Klub. “Leave your troubles outside,” beckons Joel Grey’s Master of Ceremonies to the audience in the opening number. Easier said than done. Cherry-picking from multiple sources – chiefly Kander and Ebb’s 1966 Broadway musical and the semi-autobiographical novel on which it was based, Christopher Isherwood’s The Berlin Stories – Fosse heightens the contrast between the libertine spirit of his main characters and the nationalist, antisemitic fervor that was sweeping through Germany at the time. In an all-time great performance, Liza Minnelli is both winning ingenue and devastating tragedienne as Sally Bowles, an American performer at the Kit Kat Klub. Fosse cleverly introduces Minnelli as a background dancer first, suggesting her willingness to conform, to literally fall in line with the crowd. But of course she doesn’t conform or shrink in the spotlight. She’s Liza Minnelli. Sally chooses to live her life moment to moment, with a spontaneous pleasure-seeking instinct that allows her to keep the blinders on. When Sally is off the stage, Minnelli’s performance recalls the vintage work of a young Shirley MacLaine, the star of Fosse’s debut feature, Sweet Charity. Jokes are made constantly about the number of men who have passed through Sally’s bedroom, but she has a bubbly naivety that suggests a born-yesterday innocence. She simply isn’t going to turn her thoughts toward the politics of the country that’s hosting her. Her world is the Kit Kat Klub, a disheveled room at a boarding house and wherever the latest party takes her. Splitting the difference between Isherwood’s gay surrogate and the heterosexual in the Broadway musical, Michael York plays Brian, a bisexual British academic who moves into the room across the hall from Sally, where he intends to teach English for money while working on his doctorate. He doesn’t have a minute to settle in before Sally ropes him into a “prairie oyster” hangover concoction (an egg with Worcestershire sauce) and works quickly and effectively to make him the closest friend she has in town. His sexuality is an obstacle that she’s able to clear – unlike his last three girlfriends – but when the two meet Max (Helmut Griem), a rich baron who likes to play the field, it leads to a bizarre love triangle that complicates their relationship. Inspired by the silent movie star Louise Brooks – both in her sharply cut bangs and her air of mystery – Minnelli commands the screen at all times, but shows tremendous versatility in a range of situations: as the featured performer of Mein Herr; as a Golden Age romcom flibbertigibbet; as a sexual adventurer; and, finally, as a woman who has developed the kind of hangover that can’t be washed away by a prairie oyster. Grey is similarly inspired as the Master of Ceremonies, acting as a kind of bellwether for the chances happening in the country, which has the effect of turning him from silly to sinister as the Kit Kat Klub starts serving a new audience. York can only seem temperamentally stodgy by comparison, but his performance accommodates Minnelli’s while giving the film a crucial moral footing in reality. Fosse’s version of this story restores a subplot from Isherwood’s book about the relationship between Fritz (Fritz Wendel), a German Jew who’s passing as Protestant, and Natalia (Marisa Berenson), a wealthy Jewish heiress who doesn’t know his secret. Fritz and Natalia’s fraught romance feels too tangentially related to Sally and Brian’s to fit snugly into Cabaret as a whole, but it signals Fosse’s seriousness in engaging in the grim truths of the period, even if that results in much more of a bummer musical than the one that played Broadway. And in perhaps the most extraordinary scene in the movie, Fosse pauses to witness a beer garden in rural Bavaria, where the entire crowd, shot from Leni Reifenstahl camera angles, comes together to join a Hitler Youth member in a soul-sickening rendition of Tomorrow Belongs to Me. (Move Cabaret toward the top of the long list of 70s studio movies that could have never been 21st-century studio movies.) There’s a way of understanding the characters in Cabaret, Sally especially, as unforgivably decadent, indulging in wine and song and sex while underestimating or willfully ignoring where the country was going. The baron Max is certainly guilty of that. But one thing Cabaret does well is remind the audience of the very human impulse to “leave the world outside” and escape into fantasy – whether that’s the fantasy of lingerie kick-lines or the fantasy that the Nazi threat can be suppressed by the German government. Sally has no power to stop any of it from happening – and Brian, when he tries, gets beaten on the streets – and so all she can do is keep going to work. History doesn’t pause for her.

2/13/2022,"Is it fair that Mrs Johnson should, courtesy of her sublime nickname, Carrie Antoinette, have become the face of complacent privilege? Whatever her faults, as recently enumerated by Lord Ashcroft, they have yet to include the dispensing of fatuous lifestyle tips for the less fortunate. Her old advisory tweets on single-use plastic were aimed, after all, at everyone less environmentally enlightened than Mrs Johnson, not just at poor people. Regardless of her taste in single-use interiors, parties and cake, Mrs Johnson has yet, publicly, to express the traditional Tory conviction that the struggling should welcome lifestyle advice from the prosperous. True, her husband has previously argued that “if having a baby out of wedlock meant sure-fire destitution on a Victorian scale, young girls might indeed think twice about having a baby”. But as the now married mother-of-two Mrs Johnson sometimes reminds us, it is sexist and retrograde to think she might be as ghastly as her partner.  If she’s not Britain’s Marie Antoinette, her elimination leaves at least two UK energy companies in contention – along with a variety of influencers, politicians and City functionaries urging less fortunate people to, among other things, work harder, freeze bread, put on another layer, ignore fraud, forget the parties enjoyed by their betters and refrain from asking for a pay rise. Not, surely, since the unlamented George Osborne was fomenting hostilities between hard-working “strivers” and undeserving “shirkers”, have the unprivileged enjoyed so much free instruction on their habits and shortcomings and bread-storing practice. Deepening inequality, and the prospect of much more to come, promises, if anything, to reinvigorate a benevolent narrative that, while recognising the difficulties of the afflicted, remains firmly committed to the status quo. “Let them wear socks” was recently, for instance, E.ON’s way of reminding any customers unable to afford heating that they are freezing for the greater good. After a strikingly ungrateful reaction to its distribution of synthetic branded socks, labelled “heating down, CO2 down”, the company said it was “incredibly sorry for how we have made some people feel”. Members of the “Ovo family” of energy suppliers have likewise learned that, in the assessment of hardship, comfortable warmth is becoming the new flatscreen TV. Below a certain income level, is it really needed? If true poverty was regularly declared after the 2008 economic crisis to be incompatible with the presence of a large television, domestic heating was generally allowed to be a necessity. Unless it was just overlooked, being cheaper at the time? Last month, perhaps to avert consumer consideration of the more affordable alternative, an energy windfall tax, some Ovo customers were treated to its “simple and cost-effective ways to keep warm this winter”. If they could neither afford heating nor expect adequate assistance, poorer customers could help themselves with star jumps, doing chores and having “cuddles”. As always in advice to this incurably prodigal class, the need for temperance had to be stressed: the “warming feeling from wine or whisky is temporary, as you’ll soon lose heat from your core and end up feeling even colder”. Such advice, as Robert Tressell mentioned in The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists (1914), has the further benefit of suggesting that the poor, when they imitate the affluent, bring their problems on themselves. “The theories that drunkenness, laziness or inefficiency are the causes of poverty are so many devices invented and fostered by those who are selfishly interested in maintaining the present state of affairs…” Just as older or smaller TVs could once be tolerated in poor households, some heating is still acceptable. But how much? Among her recent hints for aspiring homeowners, which included shunning Netflix and gyms, and roaming Britain for any property unwanted by second-home buyers, the television celebrity Kirstie Allsopp also mentioned heating. Fuel poverty is a nightmare, she said, but “for those who aren’t in fuel poverty, if rising energy bills persuade them to turn their thermostat down to 17C that would be great. I keep my house at 17C.” This miserable recommendation, though it must certainly help people like the Allsopps with two properties to maintain, would not work for everyone. The World Health Organization advises a minimum room temperature of 18C; higher settings for vulnerable groups. And this disregards evidence that women are typically 2.5C too cold in temperatures comfortable for men. As much as Allsopp is to be admired for proposals that could add up to a deposit, if adopted, within less than 40 years, her message had, alas, an inescapable flavour of historical lectures on indigent improvidence. Once Netflix and gym membership are counted as unwarranted luxuries, we are pretty much back in the world of Orwell’s The Road to Wigan Pier, frowning on sugar consumption and movie-going. At the same time, Seebohm Rowntree was arguing for the inclusion in working-class budgets of “sundries”, for instance a radio, alcohol, holidays, presents, football. “Working people are just as human as those with more money. They cannot live just on a ‘fodder basis’. They crave for relaxation and recreation just as the rest of us do.” My tip, for what it’s worth, is never to take budgetary advice from a fashion influencer, energy company, member of the English peerage or a governor of the Bank of England, all the more so when this coincides with a cost of living crisis to which the only solution is structural. That said, it wouldn’t hurt to hear some practical hints from Rishi Sunak. Although vast personal wealth combined with wilful-looking poor-blindness might appear, on the face of it, a clear qualification for Marie Antoinette status, that seems, in the light of his fake discounts and fraud-tolerance, distinctly overgenerous. Sometimes, you can’t help feeling, the fabulously rich are their own worst enemies.

2/13/2022,"It only took six dozen trucks, and a few hundred protesters to bring Canada’s capital to a standstill and close a critical border crossing with the US, throttling the car industry that straddles the line between both countries and relies on a constant flow of trade. On Saturday, Canadian authorities finally began taking action to clear the Ambassador Bridge into the US, the busiest land crossing in North America, which had been blockaded by just over a dozen trucks and smaller vehicles, and a crowd a few hundred strong.  The bridge has been closed for the best part of a week now, and meanwhile downtown Ottawa has been under a form of siege for more than a fortnight, blockaded by crowds gathered under the banner of opposition to Covid regulations. The protest has melded genuine grievances and fears about how the pandemic has upended lives with conspiracy theories and racist extremism, helped by some degree of funding from abroad. A handful of demonstrators have turned up with Trump banners and Confederate flags. The seductively open-ended rallying call for a “freedom convoy” has sparked an unlikely global movement. Around the world other police forces were moving this weekend to clear or block copycat actions. New Zealand police used a sound system playing Barry Manilow songs to tackle a gathering in Wellington, and in France thousands of police fanned out to motorway tollbooths around Paris to stop a “convoi de la liberté” from getting into the city, and used teargas on protesters in the Champs-Élysée. “The right to demonstrate and to have an opinion is a constitutional right guaranteed in our republic and in our democracy the right to block others or stop them from coming and going is not,” said prime minister Jean Castex. “If they block the traffic or try to block the capital we will be very strict.” In North America, authorities are drawing up longer-term plans to tackle truck convoys, whose organisers have floated the idea of trying to barricade events from the Coachella music festival to the Super Bowl, and mooted a convoy from California to Washington DC. The protest in downtown Ottawa that thrust Canada into an unwelcome international spotlight may prove harder to dismantle, and the shockwaves from the last two weeks may prove harder still for the country’s political class to shrug off. The protesters are a tiny minority in a country which has, on the whole, embraced the protection against Covid offered by science. Canada has one of the highest rates of full vaccination anywhere in the world, with more than 80% of people covered. The truckers are also a minority in their profession. The union Teamsters Canada, which represents 15,000 drivers, has also denounced “despicable displays of hate” at the protests, which it said did not represent “the vast majority of our members”. But the trucks form an obstacle that is much harder to move from the freezing streets than the crowds of individual protesters or smaller vehicles that police might have faced in the past. A state of emergency has been declared, residents have launched legal action against protesters and prime minister Justin Trudeau has moved out of his official residence. Police are meant to be trying to choke off the group by keeping food and fuel supplies out of the main protest zone, although they are taking limited action on the ground. A bank has frozen their funds and two sites, GoFundMe and GiveSendGo, shut down their fundraising. But several protesters told the Observer that the rights they were fighting for were worth any financial hit. Rebecca, who did not want to give her last name, lives near the protests and has joined them regularly. She has been on unpaid leave from her government job for months, after a request for a vaccine exemption on religious grounds was rejected. “I am a human rights activist. I don’t think that vaccines should be mandated for people to keep jobs. And that is the primary reason I’m down here,” she said. That sense of a heroic mission, also fuelled for some people by conspiracies such as QAnon, may make these protests far harder to end than demonstrations on behalf of specific political demands. “[They think] ‘We’re here to save you, we’re here to wake up the sleeping masses to the true reality of what’s going on.’ They’ve become heroes in their own story,” said Amarnath Amarasingam, an associate professor at Queen’s University in Ontario who specialises in social movements and extremism. “I don’t think that’s a challenge for security reasons from a terrorism perspective … But I think it does have an impact on how long this goes for because it’s not simply something you can negotiate with and say, ‘OK, the mandates will disappear’ or ‘this will go away, you can go home now.’” The nature of the protests meant they presented an unprecedented policing challenge for authorities, said Scot Wortley, a criminology professor at the University of Toronto. “Perhaps the closest thing we’ve had would be the uprising on 6 January in the US. So to say, ‘Oh, [Ottawa’s police chief] should have followed some kind of rulebook or some kind of strategic plan,’ I think that’s unrealistic,” he said. That insurrection in Washington DC was a reminder of how internet conspiracy theories, harnessed to a political cause, can erupt into mainstream political reality and permanently alter it. There, as in the Canadian protest movement, the crowd included advocates of the extremist QAnon conspiracy theory. In the Ottawa protest’s first days, QAnon’s self-proclaimed “Queen of Canada”, Romana Didulo, burned a Canadian flag outside parliament. She has previously called for the extermination of parents who vaccinate their children. The Canadian protests have given a disturbing platform to a range of other dark fringe views, amplified by genuine concerns. “Nominally protesting against vaccine mandates, the freedom convoy represented a medley of real, imagined and exaggerated issues bound together by a common sense of alienation and grievance,” Daniel Panneton, an online hate researcher, wrote in an editorial for the Globe and Mail. “[It] included a motley array of Western separatists, anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists, antisemites, Islamophobes and other extremists. This wasn’t a surprise to anyone who’d been paying attention: Several of the convoy organisers have a history of white nationalist and racist activism.” Convoy organisers named in a class-action lawsuit by Ottawa residents who say their lives have been unreasonably disrupted include Tamara Lich, who until recently had a role in a separatist party; Pat King, a conspiracy theorist who has shared racist tropes, and Benjamin Dichter, a podcast producer who has been sued for allegedly spreading Islamophobic smears. Even if the few Trump signs and Confederate flags have captured media attention, it is the Canadian flag that has become the symbol of this movement. The red maple leaf is painted on the sides of trucks, tied around people’s necks as capes, embroidered into their hats and carried in children’s tiny hands. And the country has extremists of its own. “Be cautious of amplifying ideas that this is a foreign funded/organised movement. This occupation movement is Canadian, made up of Canadians, organised by Canadians,” the Canadian Anti-Hate Network tweeted last week. Yet while it would be naive to write these protests off as a simply an organic expression of legitimate political grievances, it would also be unwise to view them as entirely politically confected, or driven by foreign forces or cash. Scott, who owns a farm equipment business outside the city and didn’t want to give his last name, said he came to check out the protests with his son. He was sceptical about the decision to paralyse Ottawa, but has concerns about the government vaccine mandates. He disagrees with protesters now, mostly because he says the blockade is distracting attention from their key cause. “I think that there’s an awful lot of Canadians that are very quiet, like myself, on this that probably are more in support,” he said. “[That said] I don’t support them being downtown any more with their trucks,” he said. “I think that, you know, the underlying message has just been discredited and discounted and pushed off to the side.” Leaders around the world faced with protests like the ones in Ottawa are trying to balance the need to combat extremism they are spreading with recognition that their leaders are tapping into very real fears and sadness. Emmanuel Macron called for those taking part in the French convoy to be calm, while saying he “has heard and respects” the discontent caused by the health crisis. “We are all collectively tired of what we have been living through for the last two years. This fatigue shows itself in different ways; in confusion for some, depression for others. And sometimes that fatigue manifests itself in anger.” He added: “We have always maintained the right to protest, democratic pluralism and parliamentary debate.” In New Zealand, a convoy of roughly 1,000 protesters that converged on parliament’s lawn and its surrounding streets on Tuesday had dwindled by Friday to a few hundred people. They claimed they would not leave until the prime minister Jacinda Ardern committed to scrapping vaccine mandates, but as in Canada the vaccine seemed to be serving as a Trojan horse for a range of other grievances. At one point a protester drew a swastika on a statue, and others scrawled “hang em high” on the steps of parliament. Cars were scrawled with various slogans: “We stand with Ottawa” and “drain the swamp”, from the Trump era, among them. The threat of that rhetoric exploding into violence was acknowledged by parliament and the country’s counter-terrorism services in November last year. Associate Professor Grant Duncan, who specialises in politics at Massey University, said legitimate concerns and questions over the mandates were getting lost in the quagmire of conspiracy and abusive language. “It’s particularly perplexing, really, to see that kind of Trump-related rhetoric and QAnon-related rhetoric alongside flags displaying symbols of Maori independence – it’s a jarring juxtaposition,” Duncan said, even if there was good reason to have a debate about the vaccine mandates in a democratic society. In a rare display of unity, not a single politician went out to meet the protesters, which Duncan said showed that both parliament, and the New Zealand population generally, had “almost zero support for this protest … This is a loud minority.” Additional reporting by Eva Corlett in Wellington and Kim Willsher in Paris",News/World news,Freedom convoys: legitimate Covid protest or vehicle for darker beliefs?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/13/freedom-convoys-legitimate-covid-protest-or-vehicle-for-darker-beliefs
2/13/2022,"After the Iraq war and the Great Recession, public trust in government plummeted while the flashpoints of race, religion and education moved to the fore. Barack Obama’s mantra of hope and change left many unsatisfied, if not seething. On election day 2016, Donald Trump lit a match. But the kindling was already there, decades in the making.  Staring at the mess is Jeremy Peters of the New York Times, with Insurgency, his first book. A seasoned national political reporter and MSNBC talking head, Peters chronicles how the party of Lincoln and Reagan morphed into Trump’s own fiefdom. He writes with a keen eye and sharp pen. Beyond that, he listens. He captures the grievance of the Republican base, its devotion to the 45th president and its varied voices. He repeatedly delivers quotable quotes, painstakingly sourced. This is highly readable reporting. At the outset, Peters acknowledges Trump’s grasp of human nature, the media and resentment. Messaging and visuals matter to Trump, as does cementing a bond with his crowds. Fittingly, one chapter is titled “Give Them What They Want …” For many, Trump did so. As president, he kept campaign-trail promises. He reshaped the supreme court, moved the US embassy to Jerusalem and battled Isis. Most of all, he stuck a barbed middle finger at political correctness. His jagged edges thrilled his core as they elicited revulsion elsewhere – just as he wanted. His persona was Melania’s problem, not theirs. Trump rode into the White House on enmity to immigration, the sleeper issue of our times, over which Democrats continue to stumble. Chants of “build that wall” delivered far more votes than “defund the police”. Trump’s mien mattered too, as Peters notes. He was relatable to working Americans. He knew where wokeness was grating, that what passes as orthodoxy in the halls of academe is not applauded by kitchen table or barstool America. “Trump’s Latino Support Was More Widespread Than Thought, Report Finds,” a Times headline announced. It was Bernie Sanders, not Joe Biden, who led among those voters in the Democratic primaries of 2020. Right now, polls show Trump ahead of Biden in that bloc. Biden’s standing has also slipped among younger Black voters. From Peters’ vantage point, Trump’s description of himself as a “popularist” – an unintended malapropism – comes close to the mark. Trump can size up an audience, meet expectations and receive their adulation. For all concerned, it’s a win-win proposition. Peters gets people on the record. Per usual, Steve Bannon is there on the page, where he rates his former boss among the worst presidents with James Buchanan and Millard Filmore. Those two failed to halt the march to civil war. Bannon also likens Trump’s history-making escalator ride to Triumph of the Will, Leni Riefenstahl’s Nazi propaganda film. “That’s Hitler, Bannon thought”, as Trump descended to a bank of cameras and microphones. Peters memorializes those italicized words as another chapter title. Elsewhere, Bannon posits that for Trump it’s all about himself, and he would be pleased to see a Republican successor fail. “Trump doesn’t give a shit,” Bannon says. “He’s not looking to nurture. He’s fucking Donald Trump, the only guy who could do it. As for Trump, he talks to Peters and his observations are frequently dead-on. Most of all, he internalized that Republican success hinged on the white working-class base, a reality to which most other GOP politicians paid lip service. Offering tax cuts to the rich while plundering entitlements didn’t quite cut it. Sure, race and culture were part of Trump’s equation. But so was preserving social security and Medicare. Voters could not be expected to support candidates who took away things they had earned. The priorities of the Republican donor class did not align with those of the swing voters who seized on Trump. In the heartland, corporations definitely aren’t considered “people” – a lesson Mitt Romney failed to learn in 2012. A country club candidate who looked and sounded like a country club candidate might win the nomination but stood to lose in November. George HW Bush, remember, eked out a single term after eight years as vice-president to Ronald Reagan. Peters relates that Trump pushed back hard when Paul Ryan, the former House speaker and Romney’s running mate, suggested curbing government-funded retirement spending. “You tried that four years ago,” Trump told him. “How’d that work out?” For good measure, Trump snapped: “No thank you.” Insurgency also documents the capitulation of those Republicans who stood ready to take on the mob as it swarmed the Capitol on January 6 but then, hours later, voted against certifying the election. Peters tells of Ronny Jackson, a retired navy rear admiral who was White House physician to Trump and Barack Obama. When the glass started to shatter, Jackson removed his tie – so it would be that much more difficult to strangle him. But Jackson’s loyalty to Trump remained. He voted to discount the results, despite all he saw. Now, Jackson demands Biden’s mental fitness be tested. Trump stokes the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. No matter, in Republican ranks at least. Fidelity to Trump and his false claims are “musts” for the foreseeable future. Mike Pence and Mitch McConnell, at odds with Trump this week, are at some political risk. Pence refused to defy his legal mandate and reject electoral college results. He sticks by his decision. Of January 6, deemed “legitimate political discourse” by the Republican National Committee, McConnell bluntly says: “It was a violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to prevent a peaceful transfer of power.” Peters sees the dark clouds.

2/13/2022,"It feels like an inversion of the natural order of things to be on Michael Crick’s doorstep. In almost 40 years as a political reporter Crick has made the kerbside ambush of his subjects, outsize furry microphone to hand, something of a personal art form. During his long stints as political editor of BBC’s Newsnight and as political correspondent at Channel 4 News it was said that there was no more alarming sentence for a government minister than “Michael Crick is waiting for you outside”. For a select few – Jeffrey Archer, Michael Heseltine, Michael Howard – those words have only been eclipsed for anxiety by “Michael Crick is writing your biography”. Crick’s house is a friendly double-fronted Edwardian terrace just off Clapham Common, south London. He bought it with his mother, Pat, 31 years ago, moved in with her for a while when his first marriage ended and since her death in 2010 has lived here with his partner, Lucy Hetherington (daughter of the former Guardian editor Alastair), and their daughter, who is now 15. He greets me grinning and a bit stir-crazy from 10 days of asymptomatic Covid quarantine, the itinerant gumshoe confined to quarters. We sit at opposite ends of a sofa in the bay window of a book-crammed through room. Crick, a boyish 63, is an obsessive collector not just of uncomfortable facts, but of much else besides. He has “just about” (said through gritted teeth) every Manchester United match day programme since the war. He also hoards political toby jugs. A lineup of the latter on his mantelpiece includes, prominently, the subject of his latest book, Nigel Farage, gurning in a spivvy suit and a gangster’s fedora.  He had been thinking of writing a book on Farage for seven or eight years before he got down to it over lockdown. The first bit of digging he did back then was into the details of a letter a teacher once sent to the head of Farage’s school, Dulwich College, when Farage was proposed as a prefect, complaining of the future Ukip leader’s “publicly professed racist and neo-fascist views”. In the course of 300 interviews with Farage’s friends and enemies since then, Crick has pieced together the definitive portrait of a character he describes as “the most significant [British] politician of the century so far…” If that billing sounds, to liberal ears, like a deliberate provocation, Crick makes a powerful case in the nearly 600 pages of One Party After Another. Farage emerges from Crick’s book both as the ultimate chancer – cheating death and political all-comers and wives and Eurocrats – and the instinctive disruptor of our political times, singlehandedly shifting both the focus and manner of debate. Some of Crick’s motivation is always setting the record straight, like a frustrated schoolmaster. “Farage has done his own memoirs twice, a lot of which needed correcting,” he says. And then, of course, he knows a story when he sees one. “He was always guaranteed box office for a news reporter. You would ask five questions, you’d get five great answers.” This was in contrast to some of Crick’s more tongue-tied political subjects over the years, who have rarely been moved to speak even when our intrepid reporter has been chasing them along the pavement. (There are YouTube compilations of Crick’s best gotcha moments. His own favourites, in no particular order, include the moment he trapped Tony Blair in a lift; the time MEP Godfrey Bloom bashed him over the head with a copy of the Ukip manifesto after Crick pointed out it contained no black faces; and his delicious line to the notably taciturn Iain Duncan Smith: “Aren’t you are taking this ‘quiet man’ thing a bit far?”) By contrast, Farage has always been happy to answer what Crick has thrown at him; he sees him as a consummate communicator. “Some, like Heseltine, are great on the platform, but hopeless with people. Farage can do both,” he says. The early reviews of the book have fallen over themselves to praise Crick’s tireless information gathering, his peerless grasp of telling detail, while expressing frustration at his refusal to pass sentence on his subject. “Quite how far-reaching Farage’s legacy will be – how damaging or beneficial, or a combination thereof – it’s far too soon to judge,” Crick writes. “It is too limp of the author not to come to his own conclusion,” Andrew Rawnsley suggested in this paper. Crick rejects the argument that a reporter can ever be too even-handed. Given the weight of evidence, though, is there not a clear case that Farage’s “breaking point” concentration on immigration is destructive and dangerous? “Yes, of course,” he says. Before continuing: “I don’t think Farage is a racist, though there is plenty of evidence that he was a both a racist and an antisemite in his teenage years. And he does, I think, like [his hero] Enoch Powell, pander at times to racists.” On the other hand, he says (there is always another hand), “the issue of cross-Channel migrants, say, is a legitimate issue and for a long time nobody else was mentioning it”. And then: “One good effect of Ukip is that it actually took support away and eventually won the battle with the BNP.” Though he catalogues every dispiriting tactic in Farage’s power-hungry manipulation of populist sentiment, there seems to be a lot he also admires. “I admire his persistence and his energy,” he says. “I don’t admire his pandering to racism, I don’t admire his ruthlessness. He was Stalinist in the way he ran Ukip. But clearly he does have a charm. I’ve had some good laughs with him.” The thread through Crick’s biographies, which began with his meticulous and sometimes gleeful dismantling of the many lies of Archer, is this fascination with extreme contradiction in certain personalities. “I write about charming monsters,” he says. “I think two-thirds of really successful high-achievers are charming monsters. Alex Ferguson [the highly reluctant subject of another Crick book] is a perfect example. When he is charming, he’s a delight, totally thoughtful and considerate. And yet he can be an absolute bastard, utterly ruthless, cut off people who were his friends, exactly as Farage has done. That combination has taken many people to power. I’ve no doubt even Hitler, Stalin and Saddam Hussein had certain charms.” Does he think writers are drawn to explain the attractions of human behaviour they fear or lack in themselves? “I suppose so,” he says. “Are there aspects of me that are like some of these people? Well, in very small ways. I can certainly be very difficult at times.” He hoots with one of his frequent, likable self-deprecatory laughs. “I’m not sure many people would identify any charm.” Another part of the attraction of Farage as a subject, I think, is that it gave him a chance to say “I told you so”. Like anyone with a background outside the south-east of England – Crick did much of his growing up in Manchester – the Brexit referendum result came as little surprise to him. “About three weeks beforehand, I was telling people that Brexit was going to win,” he says. “But I don’t think many of my colleagues at Channel 4 News – or at the BBC – believed it, because they mainly mixed in liberal circles and they didn’t want to know that there were vast numbers of people out there who had serious misgivings about immigration and about Europe.” That kind of wishful myopia, he suggests, is one of the reasons he recently decided to end his 10-year stint at Channel 4 and take up a role at the Daily Mail’s “in depth” Mail+ project, contributing a characteristically entertaining and informed weekly online video report, as well as a Friday column. “I ended up having arguments [at Channel 4],” he says. “Under the then editor [Ben de Pear], I felt the programme was on an anti-government, anti-Brexit crusade. It made it very difficult to do your job. And to me it was wrong. I was brought up in the tradition of David Nicholas, who was editor of ITN when I first joined 40 years ago, and who just turned 91. He used to say, ‘If we get an interview with God, then the first thing the newsdesk has got to do is get on to the devil’s office and give him the right to reply’.” It seems perverse to respond to that perceived partisanship to take up a job at the Mail, the news organisation that arguably has done most to polarise debate before and since the EU referendum. Was one of the attractions giving two fingers to the “liberal establishment”? “No,” he says. “The attraction was it [Mail+] was a new venture. And they came along and offered me this great job.” Good money? “Yes and for two and a half days a week. It’s bloody hard work. For the first time in a long time I don’t have a producer, so I do all the films on my own, but I have a lot of fun and total freedom.” The flexibility also allowed him to devote more time to his book and to indulge his anorak’s passion for constitutional politics by helping to set up an academic unit at Manchester University, which will monitor the selection process of MPs. Crick has been a political animal for as long as he can remember. His parents, both teachers, met when they were both officers at the socialist club at Cambridge University. His father gave up that cause, but his mother, who collected miners’ badges in old age, remained committed. “She died before Corbyn came to prominence, but she would have been a big Corbyn supporter,” Crick says. “Whereas my father’s politics are now much more like mine, more centrist and a bit cynical.” Crick describes Boris Johnson as “easily the worst prime minister in 100 years”. But he also tends to agree with his old man “that if you think the Johnson government is incompetent, then a Jeremy Corbyn government would have been 10 times worse”. Crick’s first book, on Militant tendency, remains the seminal account of how a fringe political force can manoeuvre itself into power. His plan was always to go into politics, but when he was offered a clear run at the safe Labour seat of Bootle in 1990, he declined, acknowledging “it was more fun to be a journalist”. Crick was a scholarship boy at fee-paying Manchester grammar school, where he wrote “the Fifth Column” for the school magazine. Several of his political friendships were formed at Oxford, where he was editor of the student newspaper Cherwell and president of the Oxford Union (as well as gaining a first in politics, philosophy and economics). Hearing him talk about those years is to be reminded of the incestuousness of Westminster. He was a contemporary of former Tory ministers Dominic Grieve, David Willetts, Damian Green and Alan Duncan. As union president, he succeeded Philip May, whose girlfriend, the recently graduated (and “very glam”) Theresa, spoke at his first debate. She was one of three acquaintances who became prime ministers, along with Malcolm Turnbull in Australia, with whom he keeps in touch, and Benazir Bhutto. What does he think about that apparently indestructible conveyor belt to power? He thinks both that it’s inevitable – Oxford has always attracted an intellectual elite – but also that its influence is waning. He has in any case always tried to maintain a scrupulous distance from politicians. “I’ve had a handful of friends who are politicians – I used to go to football matches with Chris Grayling – but the number who’ve been here [to Clapham] in 30 years is probably about three. I’m a bit like Farage in that respect; I regard myself as a sort of anti-establishment person and yet I want to be inside it in a way. I’d never join a gentlemen’s club, but I’m not averse to going to them. I do the old boys’ column for the school magazine.” He gives another of his frequent hoots of self-mockery. “There is,” he insists, “a long tradition of establishment revolutionaries.” Some of the most fascinating material in the new book is Crick’s account of Farage’s formative relationship with his parents: the alcoholic stockbroker father and the mother who was a very enthusiastic nude model for the Women’s Institute in Surrey. If you were to seek similar insights into Crick you would no doubt want to dwell on the two sticking points of his childhood: his inevitable marginalisation within the family after the arrival of triplet sisters and the fact that his parents split up when he was 18. “I carried on living with my father in the holidays; my three sisters went to live with my mother,” he says. His father was “very much more academic” than him and a rugby man rather than a football fan. Part of Crick’s rebellious streak saw him follow his beloved Manchester United, home and away from about the age of 12, hitchhiking alone or on the train; he once tried to have his name changed to George Crick in honour of his hero, George Best. When Rupert Murdoch’s BSkyB tried to take over the club in 1999, he took months off from Newsnight to work on a (successful) rearguard action. There was in his early journalism a powerful sense of moral outrage about him. He was, by the accounts of contemporaries, a natural in the role of the martyred messiah in a school mystery play. I remember covering Jeffrey Archer’s perjury trial for the Observer. However early I arrived in court, Crick, his pencils metaphorically sharpened, would already be in place. You wouldn’t say he has lost his edge since then, but perhaps become more alive to cases for the defence. I remind him of something he said to the Telegraph in 2007 not long after his marriage ended following his admission of an affair. The interviewer wondered if those events made him feel more sympathetic towards Archer? “Yes, I suppose so,” Crick answered at the time. “Indeed, to people in general. Ten years ago, I would have been horrified by the idea that I would have had an affair and I wouldn’t have been very understanding with myself. I am a lot more understanding of people when that happens.” Reading his current book, I sense that empathic impulse has advanced with age? “Well,” he says, “yes. Life is certainly complicated. And Farage is a case where his life has been very complicated. As with the prime minister, his affairs are part of the political story.” (Or as one quoted aide to Farage puts it, less delicately in the book: “He’d shag anything that let him.”) If Crick remains fascinated by recklessness, he also knows that stories never end when the cameras retreat. I’m not surprised to discover he sees all the subjects of his books as lifelong projects. He religiously keeps up with Archer’s novels, for example. When he saw Archer, a man he did more than anyone to incriminate and ultimately incarcerate, recently at a book launch, he couldn’t resist sidling up to say hello. He has long coveted a plan to make a radio documentary about the novelist and his conman father (and Archer’s “unknown” half-sister, a baroness who was married to an American presidential candidate). What did he say? “Well,” Crick recalls, laughing, “I said, ‘I know you and I’ve had our differences, but can I take you out to lunch?’” Archer didn’t say no outright, so Crick believes it will happen. I sense he half-fears, half-relishes the idea that he might find himself in a similar kind of long-term dance with Farage. “I was,” he says, “a bit sad that I had to finish the book in the end.” He felt there were still things to discover, not least perhaps a little more about Farage’s curious relationship with Julian Assange, which Crick examines without ever fathoming. He has no doubt that there will be dramatic future chapters in Farage’s career (he points to a poll he discovered that suggested 54% of Tory party members would favour him as their next leader). That’s the other thing about these charming monsters, however much you expose them to the light – and no one works harder at that illumination than Crick – they don’t simply disappear. They invariably come back for more.  One Party After Another: The Disruptive Life of Nigel Farage by Michael Crick is published by Simon & Schuster (£25).

2/13/2022,"Hayley Flynn has lived in Manchester since 2008 and runs Skyliner Tours, which specialises in walks inspired by the city’s hidden heritage  I’m a fan of relaxed, daytime dining, so Trove in the Ancoats district, sister bakery to the Levenshulme original, is my favourite place for Scandinavian-inspired pastries (pictured), home-brewed chai and bestselling sourdough. The people behind it also run nearby Erst, the natural wine bar and restaurant, focusing on fresh, contemporary food. For dinner, The Spärrows, beyond the arches of Victoria train station, is a homely little place. The house speciality is dumplings and spätzle, a fresh-egg pasta from central Europe. I love their slow-cooked beef goulash Tyrolese. I love wandering the public-realm borderlands around the edges of the city. I take inspiration for my walks from the old Victorian alleyways that are part of our erased-by-time heritage. My favourite forgotten space is Pomona Palace, a former botanical garden just beyond the Castlefield area. People don’t realise there are lots of inspirational open spaces within just 10 minutes of the city centre. The Northern Quarter, between Piccadilly and Victoria railway stations, celebrates 30 years of renaissance this year. The council first commissioned artist-in-residence, Liam Curtin, to create art to trigger organic growth there in 1992. I use that art to tell the story of Manchester’s equivalent of a New York district. The Northern Quarter is now the city’s social hub, centred on traffic-free Stevenson Square. It’s often used as a film set; Dale Street was recently used for filming Morbius, the Spider-Man spin off. I take tours along the Tib Street public art trail with the poem Flags by Lemn Sissay set into the pavement, and the wall murals telling stories of traders from old Smithfield Market. I keep uncovering snapshots of history here, like the mosaic sign on Port Street’s ice-cream parlour. The Northern Quarter is also home to a couple of stalwarts of alternative Manchester: Piccadilly Records and the indoor market at Afflecks. There are some hidden-gem public spaces, such as Parsonage Gardens just off Deansgate, and Peel Park in Salford, one of the UK’s oldest public parks, dating from 1846. In the coming year or two we’ll have the new park at Mayfield, which is uncovering parts of the River Medlock. Heading up Oxford Road, meanwhile, there’s All Saints Park and neighbouring St Augustine’s Church by Manchester Metropolitan University. The Edinburgh Castle in Ancoats is a friendly, cosy pub, but the back room has a great, almost mystic atmosphere – like a Parisian absinthe parlour. It’s my perfect pub. My other favourite is YES on Charles Street, with live music in the Pink Room, bar food by Doner Summer vegan kebabs, a beer garden and roof terrace. It hosts the best alternative karaoke night in the downstairs Karaoke Dungeon. My go-to tune? Jesus He Knows Me from Genesis’s We Can’t Dance album. I really like the newly revamped Kimpton Clocktower Hotel (doubles from £107 B&B), near the Palace Theatre on Oxford Street. The former Refuge Assurance Company building is Grade II-listed, dating back to 1890, and the hotel retains lots of original features. The bar and restaurant, The Refuge, is a beautiful place that doesn’t put on any airs and graces. That sums up Manchester for me: a global city that still feels local for those who live there.",Lifestyle/Travel,A local’s guide to Manchester: from forgotten Victoriana to karaoke dungeons,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/13/a-locals-guide-to-manchester-from-forgotten-victoriana-to-karaoke-dungeons
2/13/2022,"The folk singer Woody Guthrie famously scrawled “This machine kills fascists” on his acoustic guitar. Such dramatic sloganeering is the privilege of youth and a grand illusion; with age comes acceptance that music – art in general – carries no serious threat. Or does it? In the 1980s, the Stasi, East Germany’s much-feared secret police, decided that the best way to fight the creep of capitalism was not with bombs and rockets but with a stealth weapon of unstable potential: poetry. Philip Oltermann’s engrossing The Stasi Poetry Circle recounts a history so outlandish and unlikely that you feel it must be true. The author was inspired to investigate after running his own poetry group for pensioners at a day centre in London’s King’s Cross . How had a brutal spy agency alighted on poetry, “this vaguest of disciplines”, as a tool for training its employees? His research brings him into contact with soldiers and border guards who attended monthly meetings of “writing Chekists” at the Adlershof compound, a place so secret it didn’t even feature on a map of Berlin. Here, they would mull over the finer points of verse while bearing in mind the writer Friedrich Wolf’s stern credo: “The material of our age lies in front of us, hard as iron. Poets are working to forge it into a weapon. The worker has to pick up this weapon.” You can almost hear the sound of pens being chewed.  Overseeing this inky mission was the circle’s leader, Uwe Berger, who, after some searching, believed he had found his star student. Alexander Ruika was a recruit who had followed his colonel father into the Guards Regiment, an elite training ground for Stasi recruits. What separated Ruika from his fellow versifiers was his use of figurative language, the “mastery of metaphor” that Aristotle believed was the mark of genius. Oltermann traces his early successes – a string of awards, publication in prestigious literary magazines – but also hears a dissenting voice in his poems that suggests Ruika was not a model Chekist but “the Hamlet of the Stasi poetry circle”, a soul at war with himself. His ambivalence becomes almost a test case in this account – how to reconcile the free fluidities of poetry with the ideological constrictions of communism. Be prepared for a sting in the tale. Contradiction also animates the story of Berger, the man at the centre of the web. A mediocre poet who won vast acclaim, he had refused to join the Socialist Unity party and yet had accumulated significant influence within the state. A total of 620,000 informers were listed on the Stasi’s books between 1950 and 1989, their role to report on dodgy tendencies and opinions among the populace. The GDR was, in effect, a nation of curtain-twitchers. Berger had been approached to join them as an “informal collaborator” and apparently took to the work with alacrity, turning out a steady flow of lies, half-truths and obfuscations. In 1982, he was rewarded by the Stasi with a silver “brotherhood in arms” medal for his efforts, though in a memoir he wrote after the Berlin Wall came down he makes no mention of it or of his reports. He implied that his work as an informant came to an end once he took over the poetry circle at Adlershof, whereas we now know this posting marked a sinister new chapter in his snitching career. Oltermann’s intention is to understand not merely the mind of the spy but the spied-upon, with a sympathy that makes the book close kin of the German film The Lives of Others. He adduces the Kafkaesque example of Annegret Gollin, a writer arrested and sentenced to prison “on the basis of a single poem that was never published”. An adventurous, independent-minded young woman who liked dancing and hitchhiking – a “tramper” in the suspicious terminology of the Stasi – Gollin was a rebel spirit who felt estranged from the party and the counterculture. Having moved to Zwickau aged 23, she joined two poetry circles where her nonconformist views were soon noted; she was eventually shopped to the Stasi and interrogated over the exact meaning of a poem, Concretia, about the proliferation of concrete high-rises. As Oltermann observes, it was as if she had been caught “building homemade explosives” rather than writing a few lines of verse. After several interviews in which she had to explain her work, Gollin was sentenced to 20 months in prison for “public vilification of an organ of the state”. Her son was packed off to a children’s home. Reading these stories of bureaucratic paranoia inclines you to wonder if the Stasi’s poetry programme wasn’t merely a willed distraction from the reality on its doorstep. After all, how could a nation right on the fault line of the east-west nuclear war zone possibly lose sleep over the smallholdings of poetic endeavour? And yet spying took a stranglehold on East Germany. As the population shrank the numbers of people employed by the Stasi multiplied; in the 1960s, it doubled in size and doubled again in the 1970s. Later, Oltermann focuses upon the career of poet-novelist Gert Neumann, whose books were so cryptic that nobody in the culture ministry could properly understand them: he was “a locksmith by trade and he wrote like one”. Nonetheless he was subjected to close surveillance and harassment that essentially amounted to gaslighting. When the Stasi felt that even this wasn’t enough it recruited his mother to spy on him. (Film idea: The Lives of Mothers.) How Neumann’s story intersects with that of Alexander Ruika is one of the happier episodes in this grippingly well-written book.

2/13/2022,"A blackbird feeding a fledged youngster in early January. Red campions flowering four months early. And the earliest recorded sighting of a rare beetle. Wildlife experts and gardeners are reporting a series of highly unusual early sightings of flora, fauna, insects and birds across Britain, some of them weeks before when they would normally appear, in a further sign that rising global temperatures are having a significant impact on British wildlife.  Spring has been creeping forward steadily for decades. Plants flowered a full month earlier in the UK between 1987 and 2019 than they did prior to 1986, a recent report published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B journal found. But this year, following a relatively mild and dry winter, experts say they have seen anomalies that could be a sign of shifting behavioural patterns in nature due to climate change. “Right now, you’d normally see a few things starting to stir, like snowdrops poking their heads above the soil and coming into flower,” said Jack Wallington, a landscape designer and author based near Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, adding that many developments feel about a month earlier than usual – despite being 300 metres up on an exposed hillside. He has also spotted “buds on trees and shrubs swelling up”, while daffodils are “rocketing”. Meanwhile, several perennials (including Calamagrostis brachytricha, Veronicastrum and Astrantia) are actively growing, which, he said “is probably about a month earlier than I would expect to be seeing them”. At the same time, the Wildlife Trusts are reporting a range of earlier than usual sightings, including barn owls preparing to nest weeks early in Ulster, red campions flowering in January in Montgomeryshire, marsh marigolds flowering weeks early in Gwent and the earliest ever sighting of a black oil beetle in Staffordshire. “We’ve definitely seen some anomalies this year,” said Kathryn Brown, director of climate action at the Wildlife Trusts. While it is too soon to officially measure whether spring is earlier than usual, she said the broader trends are plain to see. “We do know very clearly that spring is coming earlier and earlier every year and that’s due to climate change,” she said. “There’s a whole range of different impacts of that happening.” Meanwhile, as well as recording a blackbird with a fledgling in Bournemouth, the British Trust for Ornithology reported that a great crested grebe had been spotted with young in Fordwich, Kent, in January, describing such a sighting as “remarkable”. Ulf Büntgen, a professor of environmental systems analysis at the University of Cambridge and lead author of a Royal Society report into plant flowering published this month, which used more than 400,000 observations from 1753 onwards, said the timing of first flowering varies from year to year, mainly driven by temperatures. But in the long term, he said, their research shows that a 1.2C rise in temperature brought spring forward by a month. In future, he warned, “ecological mismatch” could have a damaging impact: “If the trends continue like this, that could have more profound effects, severe effects, on the functioning and productivity of ecosystems, because things that depend on each other in terms of timing – insects, plants, other animals – get disrupted.” Lorienne Whittle, citizen science officer at Nature’s Calendar, the Woodland Trust’s reporting project, said earlier springs are becoming “the new normal”; 2019 and 2020 were particularly early. So far this year, she reports sightings of birds nesting, frogspawn and butterflies emerging. Using the “spring index” calculators – first flowering of the horse chestnut and hawthorn and the first sightings of an orange-tip butterfly and swallow – between the early 1900s and now, she said spring has moved forward more than eight days. Juliet Sargeant, a West Sussex-based garden designer and 2016 Chelsea flower show gold medal winner, said she has noticed shrubs coming into leaf earlier. While there had been a general progression towards earlier springs, “this year has been so mild, we’ve had almost no winter to speak of, so far”. But the weather’s unpredictability meant that gardeners had to remain “particularly vigilant” for overnight frost, she added. The Royal Horticultural Society said it had seen soaring visitor numbers to its five gardens as people made the most of the spring-like conditions, with a 90% increase across all of its gardens in the first week of February compared with the same period last year (when they were open but under Covid restrictions). The society’s chief horticulturist, Guy Barter, said Christmas roses, bulbs, crocuses and early flowering shrubs such as camelias are “looking particularly great this year because they haven’t been spoilt by the rain and frost”. Mark McCarthy, manager of the National Climate Information Centre at the Met Office, said that, from a meteorological perspective, spring doesn’t start until 1 March, but that so far this winter had been about a degree warmer than the average, “with a relative absence of notably cold and frosty conditions”.",News/Environment,"Blooming flowers, fledgling birds … the UK’s spring is early – and always will be",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/13/early-spring-changing-behaviour-flora-fauna-climate-change
2/13/2022,"Removing a white face mask as she took the witness stand behind a Plexiglass shield, Sarah Palin likened herself to the biblical David taking on the mighty Goliath of American media, the New York Times newspaper. The 58-year-old’s appearance in a Manhattan courtroom this week was a far cry from her heyday on the campaign trail, whipping up crowds with incendiary rhetoric as a US vice-presidential candidate in 2008.  But in making her pitch to a jury – the only nine voters who matter this time – Palin still had a star power, and reflex for bashing the media, that served as a reminder of how she paved the populist way for Donald Trump. And when the former governor of Alaska was asked whether she might run for office again, she teased a back-to-the-future scenario for the Republican party and America. “The door’s always open,” she told the court. Anyone wondering, “Whatever happened to Sarah Palin?” has not been paying attention to headlines of late. She declared that she would get the coronavirus vaccine “over my dead body”, duly tested positive for Covid-19 and went dining out in New York anyway, flouting public health guidelines. The infection did cause a delay in her defamation trial against the New York Times, which published a 2017 editorial that incorrectly linked Palin to a mass shooting six years earlier (it corrected the editorial the following day but she contends that the correction did not go far enough). Once the trial got under way, Palin told jurors she was “mortified” by the mistake and called the Times “the be-all, end-all, the loud voice in American media”. She said: “It was devastating to read a false accusation that I had anything to do with murder. I felt powerless – that I was up against Goliath. The people were David. I was David.” But she faces an uphill battle against a paper that has not lost a defamation case in more than half a century. She must convince jurors that the Times acted with “actual malice”, meaning that it knew the editorial was false or had reckless disregard for the truth. The court has heard Palin – she and husband Todd divorced in 2020 after 31 years – describe herself as a single mother and grandmother who “holds down the fort” for her family in Alaska when not advising candidates about “the good, bad and ugly” of politics. She also recalled the surprise over her eruption on the national political stage in 2008, saying: “I don’t think they were prepared for me.” That is an understatement. Palin was a wildly improbable choice back then as running mate for Republican John McCain in the contest with Democrat Barack Obama, bidding to become the first Black president, and his running mate, Joe Biden. The ascent of Palin – going outside what had been deemed an acceptable talent pool in terms of experience and judgment – is now seen as a pivotal moment in American political history, opening a Pandora’s box of divisive, nativist, anti-intellectual, celebrity-driven smash-mouth politics. Steve Schmidt, then a senior adviser to the McCain campaign, was the first to float the idea of Palin as running mate. In an interview with the Guardian, Schmidt said his exact words were: “We should take a look at Sarah Palin. I don’t know a lot about her other than she’s the most popular governor in the country with an 87% approval level.” So it was that in August 2008 McCain invited Palin to his ranch in Sedona, Arizona, to consider the bold move. Schmidt recalled: “Mark Salter [another adviser] and I are there with McCain, and McCain says, ‘Come on, boys, let’s go talk to her.’ “I said to him, ‘It’s completely inappropriate for us to be in this meeting. This is a presidential-level decision. Only you can make the determination she’s prepared to take the 35-word oath and become president.’” So Schmidt and Salter did not attend. “The singularly greatest regret of my life,” Schmidt acknowledged this week. “It’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever done.” He is convinced that, had they been in the room, they would have immediately realized how unprepared and unqualified Palin was and done everything in their power to talk McCain out of it. “No one will ever know what the discussion was,” continued Schmidt, a co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. “There were two people in the room: him and her. I’m fairly certain if there was a substantive conversation that I was party to I would’ve chained myself to the back of the bumper to stop her from being announced. “I’ve never encountered a person and I’ve never experienced in my political career someone so abjectly dishonest. You could not get a straight answer on a question on the most basic informational level, which was my initial warning sign about her in the hours after McCain picked her.” McCain’s impulsive and fateful decision – for which he later expressed regret – is chronicled in a new book, Insurgency: How Republicans Lost Their Party and Got Everything They Ever Wanted, by Jeremy Peters. He writes: “McCain turned to his wife, Cindy. ‘John, it’s a gamble,’ she said. “This made McCain’s face light up. ‘Well, I wish you hadn’t said that,’ he said. McCain, an avid craps player, balled up his fist and blew on it, then shook it like he was about to roll a pair of dice. ‘Fuck it,’ he said. ‘Let’s do it.’” The gamble backfired as McCain still lost the election and, in the eyes of critics, tainted his legacy by accelerating the Trumpification of the Republican party. During the campaign Palin’s ignorance became clear as she stumbled over basic questions such as what newspapers and magazines she read. She accused Obama of “palling around with terrorists” and used the term “shuck and jive” to portray him as evasive and dishonest. (She later wrote on Facebook: “For the record, there was nothing remotely racist in my use of the phrase ‘shuck and jive’.”) Peters, a journalist at the New York Times, said in an interview: “She is the tip of the spear for Donald Trump and everything he unleashed in American politics. Like Trump, her appeal to her supporters was as much about who her perceived enemies were and as it was about her herself. “She also had a really intuitive sense of how to go into combat with those enemies, especially the media. She was the canary in the coalmine when it came to doing lasting damage to the reputation of the mainstream media, which had already been taking a beating but had never been made into a real political enemy to the extent it would be under under Trump.” Palin’s loose talk of the media “making things up” and claims that it should “quit lying” foreshadowed Trump’s popularisation of phrases such as “‘enemy of the people” and “fake news”. Peters added: “She also had a real sense for social media and using that to basically say whatever she wanted and get attention that wouldn’t require her to go to the mainstream media, because the mainstream media would then just cover whatever she said on Facebook.” Palin went on to campaign for the Tea Party, a conservative revolt fuelled by rage against elites, distrust in government and racial hostility to Obama. It was another harbinger of the “Make America Great Again” white grievance movement. Palin had a five-year stint as a contributor to the conservative Fox News channel on a reported $1m contract, endorsed Trump for president and, emulating his past career as a reality TV star, made a surprise appearance on The Masked Singer, rapping and dancing in a pink bear costume. Now, should she pull off an unlikely legal victory over his old foe the New York Times – a judgment that could have a chilling effect on freedom of the press – Trump would probably be the first to congratulate her. What he may never grasp is the political debt he owes her. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “Would there be a Donald Trump without Sarah Palin? It’s hard to imagine Trump coming out of nowhere. Sarah Palin paved the way for Donald Trump.” Last year Palin hinted at an Alaska Senate run against Republican moderate Lisa Murkowski. If Trump regains the White House in 2024, she might find another comeback path. Jacobs admitted: “I find it impossible to make predictions about a Republican party that has veered so far to the extreme, so far towards irresponsibility. “This is a party without a measure of itself. It’s a chaotic party that no longer has core principles so yes, I could see Palin ending up in the cabinet if she were able to rehabilitate herself and find a way to become relevant again.”",News/US news,‘She paved the way for Trump’: will Sarah Palin stay in the Republican spotlight?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/13/sarah-palin-republican-party-trump-defamation-trial
2/13/2022,"Labour will put the fight against crime at the heart of its campaign for May’s local elections amid signs that the scandal enveloping Boris Johnson over alleged lockdown-busting gatherings in Downing Street is badly damaging the Tories’ reputation as the party of law and order. The move by Keir Starmer’s party comes as Conservative MPs say they are being told by local councillors and constituency associations that they don’t want the prime minister to go on the campaign trail or appear on party literature before the polls on 5 May because the issue of rule-breaking parties inside No 10 is so toxic.  One Tory MP told the Observer: “My association members told me it would be better if the PM stayed away and that they wanted it to be all about local people campaigning on local issues. They think our only chance of doing OK is to keep those associated with partygate out of sight altogether.” Last week – in a sign that Johnson is seen by Tory strategists as more of an election liability than an asset – the Conservatives put out a party political broadcast that made no mention of him at all, referring only to what it claimed was a list of the government’s achievements, such as the vaccine programme. Labour, however, is determined to remind people of Johnson’s part in the scandal, and highlight the questions that the controversy raises about respect for the law and commitment to tackling crime. The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said there was a clear link between Johnson’s lack of respect for rules in No 10 and his party’s failure to prioritise tackling crime in local areas. “Boris Johnson shows a total lack of respect for the rule of law in Downing Street and a total lack of respect for people who are suffering when the law breaks down in their communities,” Cooper said. “We will be campaigning strongly on crime in the local election campaign because our communities deserve so much better.” Alarmingly for the Conservatives, the latest polling figures from Opinium show Labour is now in the lead on the issue of crime. Thirty-two per cent of people said that they thought Starmer’s party would handle the issue best, against 29% who preferred the Conservatives. No 10 has confirmed that the prime minister, along with about 50 other people, had been sent a questionnaire by the Metropolitan police about parties in Downing Street which they are expected to complete “truthfully” within seven days. Labour says Johnson and his party have also resorted to misrepresenting crime figures to hide their poor record. Earlier this month, the head of the UK Statistics Authority reprimanded the prime minister and the Home Office run by Priti Patel for saying that crime had fallen by 14%, when this excluded the fastest-rising category, fraud and computer crime. Sir David Norgrove said he would be writing to the PM and home secretary to highlight what he called their “misleading” use of statistics. When fraud and computer crime are factored in, the latest official data shows that crime is now 14% higher than before the pandemic, with the rate of cases which result in charges having fallen to a record low of just 6% of reported crimes. Police figures also show that since the end of lockdown last summer, recorded crime has increased significantly, including steep increases in violent offences, which are now 20% higher than in the same period before the pandemic. At the same time, the proportion of cases leading to charges of violence against the person has fallen from 14.6% in 2016 to just 5.4% in 2021. That means prosecutions for only one in 20 violent crimes. Charge rates for robbery have fallen from 12.2% in 2015 to 6.9% in 2021, those for theft have fallen from 8.3% to 4.3%, and those for rape have fallen from 5.9% to just 1.3%. The local elections across England, Wales and Scotland will be a huge electoral test for the Tories and a moment of high risk for Johnson, if he has not by then already been ousted from Downing Street in a confidence vote by his own MPs. Cooper said Labour was determined to show it was the “true party of law and order” by promoting its own policies, including putting neighbourhood “police hubs” back in communities to tackle crime. A newOpinium poll for the Observer shows Labour is now also neck and neck with the Tories when voters are asked which party would be best at running the economy, another area where the Conservatives have traditionally been strong. Some 30% say the Tories would run the economy best, against 29% who say Labour. Overall, based upon on a new methodology used for the first time by Opinium last week, Labour is on 37%, with the Tories on 34%. The Lib Dems are on 11%, Greens on 6%, SNP on 3%, Plaid on 1%, and others on 8%. Opinium says the new methodology gives a more accurate picture of where voters sit. But the company says that the figures do not represent any fall-off in support for Labour – if the old methodology had been used, the headline figures would have put Labour up three points on a fortnight ago on 42% and the Conservatives down two on 32%.",News/Politics,Labour puts crime top of May election agenda to hurt PM,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/13/labour-keir-starmer-may-election-agenda-crime-law-and-order-

The word ‘gentle’ used to set alarm bells off in my head. To me, it was a euphemism for: ‘I don’t actually do much.’ Gentle often meant poor results. I needed products that made bolder statements. But over the years I’ve come to understand that skincare should always be gentle – your skin barrier demands it – but you shouldn’t have to compromise on efficacy. Another thing that would have made me run a mile is the word ‘foam’. Too reminiscent of the paint-stripping stuff I was recommended as an acne-prone teen. Foam, they said, was the ultimate sign of a good cleanse. And if you had breakouts, it was because you just weren’t cleansing enough. Thankfully, these myths have long been debunked. And thank goodness for that because I would have missed out on this cleanser, which, frankly, is a triumph. Yes, it’s gentle and yes it foams, but forget what you once thought. The formulation is fantastic. It cleans brilliantly, leaves no residue and, thanks to the vitamin C, is also brightening.

2/13/2022,"Constabulary powers in the UK derive from the principle of policing by consent. Articulated by the first commissioners of the Metropolitan police in 1829, it is the principle that the power of the police is granted not through the instruments of the state but by the consent of the public. Police derive their legitimacy solely through the approval and respect of the communities they serve. The publication of the Macpherson inquiry report into the Met’s handling of the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1993 was a seminal moment for British policing. It exposed just how far its biggest police force had strayed from the principle of policing by consent and the extent of the appalling levels of institutional racism that had allowed the investigation into a racist murder to be so comprehensively bungled.  The report’s findings should have led to a fundamental reset but, in recent years, the full extent of the institutional prejudices that live on in the Met have revealed themselves. Today, black people are nine times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police, up from five times more likely at the time the report was published in 1999. There have been yet more terrible failings. The rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving Met officer, jokingly dubbed “the rapist” by colleagues. The convictions of officers for sharing images of two murdered black women, Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, and using “degrading and sexist” language about them. The failure of Met officers to take seriously the drugging and murder of men lured, using an online dating platform, by Stephen Port, which a jury found allowed more killings to proceed. The undercover Met officers who lied to women and conducted long-term sexual relationships with them. The misogyny, bullying and sexual harassment revealed in a police watchdog inquiry into Charing Cross police station, dismissed as “banter” by officers. Many were hopeful that Cressida Dick would bring a change in culture at the Met when she was appointed as the first female and openly gay commissioner five years ago. However, Dick has been a poor and defensive leader, putting loyalty to her rank and file – even when there is serious wrongdoing – far above her responsibility to win the consent of the public for policing in London. She has denied there is still institutional racism in the police and dismissed the findings of institutional corruption made by the independent panel that looked into the murder of Daniel Morgan. Rather than engage with the criticism of the police, she has depicted opponents as “armchair critics”. She has failed to grapple with the fact that policing attracts recruits with unsavoury motives who can take the opportunity to abuse power that a police uniform creates. And she has failed to reform a culture in which loyalty to fellow officers is prized above all else, including professional standards. There are insufficient incentives for officers to build positive relations with local communities and whistleblowing is too often career-ending. Little wonder, then, that she has overseen a decline in trust in policing in the capital, particularly among women. Dick’s resignation, announced last week, is therefore long overdue. However, it would be a mistake to think replacing her is sufficient to reform the problems we see in policing, not just in London but across the country. The public inquiry into the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust helped set in train a series of reforms to improve patient safety; policing desperately needs a similar light to be shone on its toxic cultures. There must be a statutory inquiry into the state of policing by public consent in England and Wales.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on the damaged credibility of Britain’s police,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/13/the-observer-view-on-the-damaged-credibility-of-britains-police
2/13/2022,"A British writer, presenter and former model says he is shocked to find himself at the centre of an unprecedented wave of book banning in the US. A Mississippi mayor has told the Madison County Library to remove LGBTQ+ books from its shelves or lose funding. One of the books singled out as an example was The Queer Bible, a collection of LGBTQ+ history essays edited by Jack Guinness. Ridgeland’s Republican mayor, Gene McGee, has refused to release funds to the library until “homosexual materials” are withdrawn.  Tonja Johnson, executive director of the Madison County Library System, said when she told McGee that the library served the whole community, he replied that he only served “the great Lord above”. Guinness discovered his anthology had been caught up in the book ban on Twitter. “I couldn’t quite believe my eyes,” he told the Observer. “When you write a book, you kind of imagine people might read it, but you don’t imagine anyone will ban it. Referring to it as ‘homosexual material’ – that’s the sort of phrase my grandmother would have used to talk about my jeans.” Guinness, once described by GQ magazine as “the coolest man in Britain”, worked as a model after university for fashion labels such as Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci and Dunhill and became a famous face on the capital’s social scene. He was friends with Pixie Geldof, DJ Nick Grimshaw and musician Florence Welch, and used to be Alexa Chung’s flatmate. He soon segued from modelling into work as a presenter and as a writer for Vogue, GQ and the Guardian. Since starting the Queer Bible as a website in 2017, he has been included in Attitude magazine’s trailblazers list of exceptional LGBTQ contributors to the arts. He is also now a member of London mayor Sadiq Khan’s diversity in the public realm commission. The Queer Bible is a book of essays “by queer heroes about their queer heroes”. Contributors include Sir Elton John, Graham Norton, designer Tan France, skier Gus Kenworthy and model Munroe Bergdorf. It is adapted from the website, which showcases LGBTQ+ people and stories. “I identified gaps in my knowledge about figures in queer history. People have had to hide their identity in the past to protect themselves, or stories have been straightwashed to fit into an accepted narrative.” Guinness and other Queer Bible contributors joined crowdfunding efforts to replace the $110,000 (£81,000) withheld by the mayor. The target has now been reached. He says he’s as surprised as anyone to find himself a campaigner. “I never imagined this would happen. I created The Queer Bible selfishly for myself because I wanted to read about queer heroes. Now I’m taking part in a campaign to fight a Mississippi mayor. It’s a surreal place to be and I feel very honoured. What keeps me going is that that this isn’t about me. It’s about using my platform so other people can tell their stories.” The American Library Association has recorded an unprecedented rise in campaigns to ban books in the last year. New legislation introduced in states such as Texas and Oklahoma has made it easier to remove books about black and LGBTQ+ stories on the grounds that “they may cause upset or stress”. Parents are behind many campaigns after getting hands-on experience of curriculum texts during pandemic home schooling. “It’s terrifying to think that one individual, due to their personal beliefs, can withhold texts from an entire community,” said Guinness. “I grew up under section 28, which forbade the promotion of homosexuality in schools. An entire generation grew up without information about their history or any understanding that they were not freaks. “Banning any book is also a slippery slope. In certain countries, LGBTQ+ people do benefit from equal rights but this shows how easy it is for things to slip. There is a shift, an idea of criminalising or deleting certain communities. Today it’s the queer community – tomorrow it could be your community.”",News/World news,"I’ll fight to overturn US ban on my ‘Queer Bible’, says British author ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/13/ill-fight-to-overturn-us-ban-on-my-queer-bible-says-jack-guinness-british-author
2/13/2022,"It would hardly be hyperbole to say that since its founding in 2004, Facebook has taken over the world – counting more than 50% of the global population as its user base. But after years of domination built on advertising revenue, , the company has nearly overnight tried to knock down that empire and build anew. In October 2021, more than 15 years and 2.8 billion users after the then student Mark Zuckerberg launched the social media platform from his college dorm, Facebook announced it had become “Meta” and was refocusing on the company’s virtual reality endeavors.  But can a Silicon Valley wunderkind successfully pull off a world-changing technology for the second time? Experts say that with regulatory concerns, technological setbacks, and branding troubles, the company’s path into the metaverse is not without its roadblocks. The attempt to reorient comes at a time when growth has become a major problem for Meta’s key business, Facebook. In its most recent quarterly results, Meta revealed that Facebook had recorded its first decline in daily active users – a key metric for investors – since it was founded in 2004. The fall from 1.93 billion users between July and September last year to 1.929 billion in the three months to December was driven by declines in Africa and Latin America, although growth dropped in the US too (not for the first time). But the company is also losing young users, who are a key demographic for the advertisers who provide 97% of Meta’s revenue, documents leaked by the company whistleblower Frances Haugen have shown. Meta and its subsidiary Instagram are facing growing competition from the video platform TikTok, analysts at research company Forrester say. “Meta has a Gen Z problem,” said Mike Proulx, a vice-president and research director at Forrester. In response, the company has launched Reels, Meta’s answer to the Chinese-owned platform. But the road to profit is long, said Proulx: “Not only does Meta have to try to win back a declining share of its key Gen Z audience but it must also figure out how to better monetize Reels in the process. Continuing to lift TikTok’s features won’t cut it.” Enhanced regulatory scrutiny of Meta has all but ruled out one solution to its growth problems: buying another large social media platform. Although an enforced split of the business is a long way from happening, a Washington DC-based district judge ruled last month that the US Federal Trade Commission has a “plausible” legal claim against Meta, rooted in the argument that the company has stifled competition by buying up its fledgling rivals Instagram and WhatsApp. Meanwhile, Lina Khan, chair of the FTC, and Jonathan Kanter, head of antitrust at the Department of Justice, have announced a review of merger guidelines – with tech among their areas of concern. Facebook’s recent VR acquisitions are already under review. Rebecca Allensworth, professor of law at Vanderbilt University, said the regulatory outlook for Meta had changed substantially since Facebook bought Instagram for $1bn a decade ago. “First, because the American antitrust agencies are looking at hi-tech mergers generally with a lot more scrutiny now, and because one of those agencies [the FTC] is now in court arguing that Meta in particular used acquisitions anti-competitively.” The forthcoming FTC case and growing regulatory scrutiny do not prevent cash-rich Meta (it has at least $48bn to spend) from attempting to pull off a mega deal, but it underlines that Zuckerberg is operating in a hostile environment. The scrutiny of Meta is not limited to its potential acquisitions. A seemingly endless series of public controversies in recent years guarantees that every part of its expanding operations is under close review. “Zuckerberg and his coterie were able to invent Facebook largely out of the glare of public attention,” said Paul Barrett, deputy director at New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. “Now, his every move will be scrutinized by rivals, potential imitators, and a far more robust tech media corps.” Those controversies include the explosion of misinformation around the 2016 US elections, the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook’s role in the persecution of the Rohingya in Myanmar, and most recently the revelations made by Haugen – including the platform’s grave health effects on young people. In light of such scandals, regulators and users alike will be ready with questions for Meta as it moves into yet another space: will users’ privacy be protected? How will it address hate speech and harassment in the metaverse? Does it have a plan for misinformation? “People will demand to know whether he’ll avoid some of the mistakes that have contributed to the many Facebook/Meta controversies,” Barrett said of Zuckerberg. When Facebook embarked on its initial ascent in the mid-2000s, it had little competition in its way. Apart from MySpace, founded just the year before, there were few other widely known social platforms. Today, Meta enters a crowded industry with established players. Game systems like Roblox and Decentraland already allow users to share worlds with one another. Can Meta – which has already invested $10bn into its metaverse – buy its way into the field? Past examples do not bode well. Apple tried to get into social media with a platform called Ping, which shut down after two years. Google attempted and failed with its own social platform called Google+. Even Meta itself fell short with its latest attempt to expand outside of social media, shutting down its cryptocurrency venture Diem (formerly called Libra) last month after repeated regulatory struggles. “They have tried to diversify revenue streams before, and frankly it did not go very well,” said Ari Lightman, a professor of marketing and digital media at Carnegie Mellon University. “Unfortunately when you get this large, you get kind of pigeonholed and it becomes difficult to move from one place to another.” The headwinds have not stopped Zuckerberg from trying. Besides the huge financial investments into the Metaverse, the company has transformed its branding and employment practices to reflect its new priorities. It has posted thousands of jobs for engineers to build hardware and software for the metaverse, pushing some employees to leave their jobs and apply elsewhere in the company. Meanwhile, it has poached a number of employees from VR projects at competing firms. The dramatic pivot to the metaverse has spooked investors, leading Meta’s stocks to plummet following the recent earnings report. The company lost more than $230bn in market value. But Zuckerberg seems unfazed, even as he seemed to acknowledge the setback. “This fully realized vision is still a ways off,” Zuckerberg said of Meta’s metaverse investments in a call with investors. “And although the direction is clear, our path ahead is not yet perfectly defined. “But I’m pleased with the momentum and the progress that we’ve made so far and I’m confident these are the right investments for us to focus on going forward,” he added.",News/Technology,‘Every move scrutinized’: Facebook’s rocky road to the metaverse,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/13/meta-facebook-metaverse-zuckerberg-future
