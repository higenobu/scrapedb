4/5/2022,"The North Carolina Highway Patrol has released another dashcam video from a traffic stop of Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) when he didn’t have his driver’s license and was speeding, according to the officer on the scene. Cawthorn was cited in October for driving 89 mph in a 65 mph zone after he was pulled over in Buncombe County, according to Queen City News in Charlotte, North Carolina, which petitioned to obtain the video. During the stop, Cawthorn said the car was his, then appeared surprised when the officer told him the vehicle was registered to his father. “It looks like it’s registered to, I guess, your dad,” the officer said after checking. “Is it really?” Cawthorn can be heard saying. It was one of three traffic violations Cawthorn wracked up in five months, according to law enforcement records. Queen City News earlier obtained a dashcam video from when Cawthorn was pulled over in Polk County in January. He was cited then for driving 87 mph in a 70 mph zone. In that dashcam video, Cawthorn can be heard telling the officer: “I’ve got a firearm in the car.” “Where’s your firearm at?” the officer asks. “OK, just keep it up there.” Last month in Cleveland County, Cawthorn was pulled over when his car allegedly drifted over the center line. He was charged with a misdemeanor for driving with a revoked license. It’s not yet clear why his license had been revoked. The unidentified officer in the January video was exceptionally polite, particularly given that Cawthorn was driving a car not registered to him, was driving without a valid license and was speeding. He tells the congressman on the video to be careful when he backs up. One critic on Twitter described the encounter as “peak white privilege.” Cawthorn’s House office told the Queen City News last month that the lawmaker expects “the traffic matters to be resolved quickly, and we remain focused on serving [our] constituents.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

4/5/2022,"Conservatives have asked Elon Musk to restore former President Donald Trump's Twitter account. Musk bought a 9.2% stake in Twitter on Monday, making him the company's largest shareholder. The Tesla CEO had earlier questioned whether Twitter was adhering to the principles of free speech. Conservative figures are urging Elon Musk to allow former President Donald Trump back on Twitter, following Monday's announcement that the Tesla CEO had bought a 9.2% stake in the social media giant. In the days prior to the announcement, Musk had tweeted several times questioning the platform's free speech rules and musing on whether a new social media platform is needed. On March 25, he also tweeted an informal poll asking his followers if Twitter had adhered to the principle that free speech is essential to a ""functioning democracy."" Of the roughly two million respondents to the poll, 70.4% voted no. With Musk becoming Twitter's largest shareholder, requests to reinstate Trump's account — which was permanently suspended on January 9, 2021 — started to surface on Monday evening. ""Great job Elon Musk! Now reinstate President Trump!"" tweeted conservative author Brigitte Gabriel. ""Now that @ElonMusk is Twitter's largest shareholder, it's time to lift the political censorship. Oh… and BRING BACK TRUMP!"" wrote Colorado GOP congresswoman Lauren Boebert. Errol Webber, a Republican America First candidate running for a California House seat, said that the ban reversal should apply to anyone who had been taken off Twitter before. ""Will the new majority shareholder return freedom of speech to Twitter?"" tweeted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who said the act would ""require courage"" because ""the regime is heavily investing in a certain industry and threats will undoubtedly come."" ""Yet the freedom of speech restored will enable us all to defeat them,"" the congresswoman added. Trump's Twitter account was permanently suspended due to the company's concerns over ""the risk of further incitement of violence"" in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riots. The former president has since created his own social media platform, Truth Social, which he has touted to be an alternative to mainstream social media sites. The platform suffered technical difficulties at launch but has begun to accumulate the same amount of traffic as its competitor, conservative social media site Gettr.com. While Musk had not directly addressed the requests as of Monday evening, the Tesla CEO referenced his new Twitter shares again by polling users on whether they wanted a button on the platform to edit their tweets and comments. It is not immediately clear how much control Musk seeks to exercise over the social media platform since the billionaire owns a ""passive"" stake in Twitter — which usually indicates that the investor doesn't intend to take an active role in running the company. However, Musk can still reconsider his position and file to take a more active stance in the company, as Bloomberg reported. Twitter did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
