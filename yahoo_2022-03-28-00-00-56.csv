3/28/2022,"In an essay published Friday on the whistleblower platform Lioness, former Microsoft manager Yasser Elabd alleged that Microsoft fired him after he alerted leadership to a workplace where employees, subcontractors and government operators regularly engaged in bribery. He further alleges that attempts to escalate his concerns resulted in retaliation within Microsoft by managers, and eventual termination from his role. Elabd claims in his essay that he worked for Microsoft between 1998 and 2018, and had oversight into a ""business investment fund "" — essentially a slush fund to ""cement longer-term deals"" in the Mid-East and Africa. But he grew suspicious of unusual payments to seemingly unqualified partners. After examining several independent audits, he discovered what he believes is a common practice: After setting up a large sale to entities in the region, a ""discount"" would be baked in, only for the difference between the full-freight cost and discounted fee to be skimmed off and divided between the deal-makers. “This decision maker on the customer side would send an email to Microsoft requesting a discount, which would be granted, but the end customer would pay the full fee anyway. The amount of the discount would then be distributed among the parties in cahoots: the Microsoft employee(s) involved in the scheme, the partner, and the decision maker at the purchasing entity—often a government official,” Elabd alleged. The former Microsoft manager gave several examples of suspicious transactions and red flags he witnessed over his two decades working for the company abroad. In one audit, Microsoft gave the Saudi Ministry of the Interior a $13.6 million discount which never reached the agency’s doors. In 2015, a Nigerian official complained that the government paid $5.5 million for licenses ""for hardware they did not possess."" In another example, Qatar’s Ministry of Education paid $9.5 million, over a period of seven years, for Microsoft Office and Windows licenses that went unused. Auditors later discovered that employees at that agency didn’t even have access to computers. “We are committed to doing business in a responsible way and always encourage anyone to report anything they see that may violate the law, our policies, or our ethical standards,” Becky Lenaburg, a VP at Microsoft and deputy general counsel for compliance and ethics, wrote in a statement to The Verge. “We believe we’ve previously investigated these allegations, which are many years old, and addressed them. We cooperated with government agencies to resolve any concerns.” Elabd claims his attempts to alert managers resulted in his being shouted at by one manager, iced out of certain deals and told by an executive that he had effectively set himself up to be let go after attempting to involve CEO Satya Nadella. After being terminated, Elabd wrote that he brought his documentation before the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice. He claims the DoJ refused to take up his case. According to Protocol, the SEC dropped the case earlier this month due to a lack of resources. “As I alleged in my complaint to the SEC, Microsoft is violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and continues to do so brazenly. And why wouldn’t they?"" wrote Elabd.

3/28/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Neither war, disease nor inflation are proving capable of preventing American stocks from doing what they’ve almost always done for 13 years: go up. How policy makers devoted to getting inflation under control will view that is becoming a hot topic on Wall Street. Most Read from Bloomberg Low-Priced Omega Speedmaster Prompts Global Swatch Store Chaos Ukraine Update: Biden Says Putin ‘Cannot Remain in Power’ Putin, Xi and the End of the World As We Know It Biden to Propose 20% Tax Aimed at Billionaires, Unrealized Gains Biden Says Putin Can’t Remain in Power After Ukraine War Right now, the 6.6% surge in the S&P 500 ranks -- somehow -- as the biggest rally to coincide with the start of a Federal Reserve rate-hike cycle since World War II, data compiled by Ned Davis Research and Bloomberg show. Fueled by positive economic reports, equities just notched their second straight week of gains, with the S&P 500 recouping half its losses since January. Two distinct views have coalesced around the rally. One, that buoyant markets create headaches for central bankers, representing a failing grade on their efforts to curb inflation and working against that goal by keeping financial conditions loose. Another school holds that as long as things stay peaceful in markets, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has freer rein to administer the type of medicine needed to get the job done. “The last thing Chairman Powell has these days is inflation-fighting credibility,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading. “Ironically, the more resilient financial markets are, the greater opportunity they provide for the chairman to reestablish that credibility.” The S&P 500 has gained in all but two sessions since March 16, when the Fed announced its first rate hike since 2018. On Tuesday, when Powell toughened his stance and said the central bank is prepared to raise rates by a half percentage-point at its next meeting, the equity gauge jumped more than 1%, rounding out its best six-day rally since 2020. Along the way, oil prices climbed back above $110 a barrel and certain segments of the Treasury yield curve inverted -- developments that just weeks ago would have stirred up recession fears and sunk stocks. No such wavering was in evidence this time. Many explanations exist for the equity resilience. Sentiment may have been washed out with professional money managers furiously unwinding risk and retail money finally retreating. At the same time, profit estimates have increased this year, leading some to speculate that stocks may be working as an inflation hedge. Others see a market that is simply glad to see the Fed taking seriously its inflation-fighting task, on grounds that it will yield long-term benefits for the economy. “In reality, the Fed is just figuring out the least bad policy to rectify the terrible mistake it made by letting inflation run this hot,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote. “The good news is that Powell’s got the market wind behind his back -- for now.” In a press conference last week, Powell said policy usually works through financial conditions to reach the real economy. That is, higher borrowing costs and lower asset prices would temper overheated demand, or vice versa. Thanks to the stock rally, however, the Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index has eased even after the Fed’s rate hike. That seems to be at odds of what central bankers aim to achieve. “Bears worry that rising equities undermine Fed efforts to tighten overall financial conditions,” said Huw Roberts, the head of analytics at Quant Insight. “Under this scenario, rising equities sow the seeds of their own downfall by provoking a more hawkish Fed.” Since the rate hike, economically sensitive stocks like producers of commodities and consumer discretionary products have led gains in the market, a sign that equity investors may be endorsing Powell’s view that the Fed will be able to engineer a soft landing in the economy. Bond investors are less sanguine. Inflation expectations have increased as traders bet price pressures will linger way past 2024, a year when the current tightening cycle is expected to end. Inflation breakeven rates on both five-year and 10-year Treasuries climbed to a record. All suggesting the Fed would need to slam the brakes harder to cool inflation, potentially tipping the economy into a recession. A flattering yield curve between two-year and 10-year Treasuries is one reason why Chris Senyek warns against chasing the equity rally. “We’re not buying the bounce, given our views that the geopolitical situation remains extremely fluid, inflation should continue to come in hot, and the growth outlook is weakening,” said the chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research. Whether further equity weakness could force policy makers to rethink their hawkish stance remains to be seen. The Fed rarely raises rates when stocks are in distress. The latest hike followed a stretch of declines where the S&P 500 tumbled almost 10% over three months. Only once since 1990 did a rate hike come when stocks suffered deeper losses than now, in December 2018. Back then, the Fed reversed course seven months later. But the economic backdrop is different now, with inflation running at 7.9%. In 2018, consumer-price gains never exceeded 3%. “Stronger stocks give the Fed more cover, but I think they’re going to be more responsive to what are the price increases coming through, how’s the labor market performing,” said Kara Murphy, chief investment officer of Kestra Holdings. “Then they’re willing to sacrifice stocks if they need to.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Hong Kong’s Completely Avoidable Covid Catastrophe Silicon Valley’s Wealthiest Russian Is Carefully—Very Carefully—Distancing Himself From Putin An iPhone Subscription Would Boost Apple’s Profit Germany Doubles Military Spending, But Can’t Rearm Overnight Private Equity Funds Are Pushing Deeper Into Pro Sports ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Surging Stock Markets Turn a Blind Eye to Fed at Their Own Risk,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/surging-stock-markets-turn-blind-200539271.html

Russia's maritime sector is already grappling with the winding down of other services including ship certification by leading foreign providers - vital for accessing ports and securing insurance - shipping companies pulling out and Western sanctions being imposed on its leading ocean transporter Sovcomflot after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Wartsila, a top global marine and energy equipment maker, has suspended all deliveries and sales to Russia and Belarus due to the war in Ukraine and would take action to ""follow the European Union sanctions framework as it evolves"", a company spokesperson said. ""As part of this, training on using our engines/ship technology for Russian legal entities has been halted, regardless of the nationality of the individuals,"" the spokesperson said. ""Such training can be offered to Russian nationals working for non-Russian legal entities. Training cannot however be offered to individuals, regardless of their nationality, having their residence in Russia."" Two shipping sources said MAN Energy Solutions had also suspended training for using its equipment in Russia. A company spokesperson said it was ""complying 100% with the imposed sanctions"". MAN Energy Solutions said separately in a statement that all existing contracts and orders connected to Russia ""have to be reviewed on a case by case base"". Shipping industry sources say given the complexities of the world's seaborne trade it was unclear how Russian companies would be able to operate with multiple services being withdrawn.

3/28/2022,"By David Randall NEW YORK (Reuters) - Side-by-side declines in U.S. equity and fixed income markets are pushing investors into cash, commodities and dividend-paying stocks as geopolitical uncertainty and worries over a hawkish Federal Reserve rock asset prices. With the first quarter of 2022 winding down, the S&P 500 is down around 5% year-to-date, after falling as much as 12.5% earlier in the year. The ICE BofA Treasury Index, meanwhile, was recently down 5.6% this year, its worst start in history. Investors have traditionally counted on a mix of stocks and bonds to blunt declines in their portfolio, with stocks ideally rising amid economic optimism and bonds strengthening during times of uncertainty. That strategy can go awry, however, and market gyrations stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, soaring commodity prices and the Fed’s hawkish tilt have combined to make it harder to follow the playbook this time around. Though a sharp bounce in stocks has more than halved the S&P 500’s losses for the year-to-date, some investors are wary the rebound may not last and are seeking to cut their exposure. ""We are in a perfect storm right now,"" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management. ""We’ve been in periods of heightened geopolitical risk before but this one feels a little different. The negative outcomes could be much more severe and broad.” Nixon is increasing stakes in agricultural and energy companies, as well as real estate investment trusts (REITs), which have acted as an inflation hedge in the past. Investors moved $13.2 billion to cash and $2.1 billion to gold over the last week, data from BoFA Global research showed. U.S. stocks saw $3.1 billion in outflows, their largest in nine weeks. The firm’s latest survey showed fund managers’ cash positions earlier this month at their highest since March 2020 . George Young, a portfolio manager at Villere & Co, is raising his portfolio’s cash allocation to nearly 15%, well above the typical 3% of assets he normally holds. ""Cash is paying literally nothing and is arguably negative because of inflation, but we're not seeing many things that we want to buy,"" he said. Recent declines have ""been more painful than many prior bouts of volatility"" due to the twin sell-offs in both stocks and bonds, wrote Michael Fredericks, head of income investing for BlackRock’s Multi-Asset Strategies Team, in a note Friday. He is growing more bullish on dividend-paying stocks, which trade at lower forward price to earnings valuations than the broad S&P 500, and are less sensitive to rising interest rates than growth stocks or bonds. Gains have been particularly hard to come by in the bond market, as investors recalibrate their portfolios to a Fed that appears ready to go all-out in its battle against inflation. Yields on the 10-year benchmark U.S. Treasury, which move inversely to bond prices, reached a three-year high of around 2.5% in the past week, with investors now pricing in more than 200 basis points of interest rate tightening this year. [FEDWATCH] With few attractive opportunities in U.S. debt, Anders Persson, head of global fixed income at Nuveen, has recently increased his positions in dollar-denominated emerging market bonds, in part due to the rally in commodity prices. ""There is not a clean play-book for a post-pandemic Fed pivot at the same time you have a war between Ukraine and Russia,"" he said. Investors will be watching U.S. non-farm payroll data next week as they gauge whether the economy is strong enough to handle the Fed's aggressive rate-hike trajectory. To be sure, some investors believe times of overriding pessimism are ideal for buying stocks, an idea supported by ample evidence of defensive position that has accompanied the S&P 500's recent bounce. BoFA Global Research analysts said their contrarian Bull & Bear Indicator recently gave a “buy” signal based on outflows from equity and credit and high levels of cash in investors’ portfolios. Adam Hetts, global head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson, said the largest risk for most investors would be ""overreacting to short-term moves"" and jumping headfirst into commodities or gold as a hedge against inflation. Hetts is steering clients into higher-quality equities with strong cash flows such as dividend stocks, and seeing increased investor interest in hedge fund strategies that can take short positions. ""We're having a historically bad start to the year, but we're trying to ensure that the cure isn't worse than the disease,"" he said.

3/28/2022,"Think 4% was bad? Mortgage rates are shooting up even further. It's rattling a housing market that is barely accustomed to perpetually skyrocketing prices, but at least had a mortgage rate of 3% or even under for much of the pandemic. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage shot up to 4.95% Friday, according to Mortgage News Daily. That's the second dramatic spike this week, after rates hit 4.72% on Tuesday. This week's interest rate spikes come as something of a surprise, as many experts had anticipated a slower appreciation in mortgage rates throughout the year. Friday's average is almost one-and-a-half percentage points higher than rates were at the beginning of the year. The rise could dissuade some potential buyers ahead of the normally busy spring housing season, and buyers were anxious about the state of the market even before factoring in a higher potential mortgage payment. That said, the market has been anything but normal over the past few years, with surplus savings and a desire for more space leading to a booming market throughout all seasons that hasn't slowed since early 2020. While many experts anticipated home price growth would slow this year, for example, the opposite has been true. That housing boom has largely depended on record-low rates, though, and an end to those, combined with record-high housing prices, scarce inventory, and decades-high inflation, might be enough to start cooling the market down. U.S. inventory fell to 729,000 home listings in February, a 25% decrease from a year prior, according to Zillow. But while the low inventory was driving up home prices before, buyers at least had low interest rates to act as a counter-balance. Now, the rise in rates will be significant for many buyers: the average monthly payment for a 30-year, $300,000 loan, for example, would be around $1,601 at 4.95%, compared to $1,339 per month at January's 3.45% average. A couple hundred dollars extra month would break many households' budgets. Then there's the decades-high inflation to deal with, and the fact that rental prices are also sky-high, meaning many potential buyers can't save as much for a home as they would have otherwise. Put together, and pending sales were already falling for the past few months, according to the National Association of Realtors, due mainly to low inventory. Mortgage applications are also down. ""The housing market is cooling very rapidly, and sales are set to fall by 20-to-30% by mid-year,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, estimates in a research note. But nothing is for certain: There are so many prospective buyers and so few homes that those priced out by rising rates may be easily replaced with other housing hopefuls. The increase is a dramatic shift from the past two years, when record low rates helped drive a buying frenzy across the country. Though they have been inching up from the record-low of 2.65% in January 2021, the average was still around 3.17% at the beginning of this year, according to Freddie Mac. Even before the pandemic, rates weren't as high as they are now: 2018 was the last time the average hit 4.94%, and it hasn't surpassed 5% since 2011. That will also put a damper on the refinancing boom of the past two years. Even before today's drop, refinance volume had dropped by more than 50% compared to a year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. There's little good news for home buyers at the moment: given that the Federal Reserve will likely raise its own benchmark rate a few more times this year, chances are mortgage rates will continue to go up.
