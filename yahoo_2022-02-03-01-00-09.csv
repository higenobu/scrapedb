2/3/2022,"Images of unrealistically thin models and celebrities have permeated popular culture for decades, causing severe damage to women's body image and mental health in the process. However, a recent study reveals that a new body ideal may be causing even more harm than the ultra-thin “heroin chic” look that came to prominence in the ‘90s—and we have Kim Kardashian to thank for it. Researchers at York University in Toronto conducted a study to find out how pervasive imagery of the “slim-thick ideal,” which has become popularized in mainstream media by celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Beyoncé, contributes to young women’s dissatisfaction with their body. Described as “a curvier or more full body type” with a “small waist and flat stomach but large butt, breasts and thighs,” the study found that the slim-thick physique is actually more damaging to the way young women feel about their bodies compared to the ultra-thin body type.  “The thin-ideal has long been identified as a threat to women’s body image, and there’s been a call for body image campaigns and the media to showcase a greater diversity of body types,” researcher Sarah McComb tells Yahoo Canada. “However, even though the slim-thick body type touts a larger frame, it is not a healthier alternative to the thin-ideal for media consumers—it was actually more threatening to women’s body image.” McComb and Jennifer Mills, a registered clinical psychologist, surveyed 402 women between the ages of 18 and 25, which are proven to be the heaviest users of Instagram. The participants viewed 13 photos of influencers with different body types: slim-thick, thin and fit. Both McComb and Mills say they were surprised to discover that those who compared themselves to slim-thick-ideal imagery “experienced significantly more weight and appearance dissatisfaction, and less body satisfaction” than those who compared themselves to thin-ideal imagery. While the thin-ideal has long been considered the most desirable body type for women, at least in white-centred mainstream media, this research suggests beauty ideals may be shifting. The study points to the Kardashian-Jenner clan as well as other influencers and celebrities who regularly share these kinds of images with their massive social media followings as the reason for the change.  According to McComb, the slim-thick body type appeals to a greater number of women across ethnic backgrounds, while previous research shows that the thin-ideal has mainly appealed to white women. Unfortunately, the slim-thick body type isn't more attainable than the thin ideal. The study notes that it would likely require plastic surgery or strategic exercises that increase muscle mass on specific body parts to achieve the curvaceous look.  And yet, social media trends from 2021 show just how idealized this body type has become in recent years. According to the study, the hashtags #thick, #thicc, and #slimthick have earned millions of posts on Instagram while the hashtag #slimthicc currently has more than 134 million tags on TikTok. “The media is the most powerful and impactful sociocultural transmitter of beauty ideals in our society,” McComb says. “What types of people and bodies are advertised in the media tells young women what body types are deemed as attractive and which are celebrated, and gives them the impression of what they should be aspiring to."" However most of what we see in the media has been edited, airbrushed and altered—a process with which the Kardashians are notoriously familiar. This leads to imagery that is even more unattainable and can result in people taking dangerous steps to try and achieve the unachievable, especially those who are prone to “physical appearance perfectionism.” Appearance perfectionism, or the act of holding unrealistic goals and expectations for one’s appearance and body, has been associated with many negative body image outcomes, the study explains, including disordered eating symptoms, appearance social anxiety, appearance and body shape dissatisfaction, unhealthy weight control behaviours, low appearance self-esteem, high impression management, high appearance management behaviours and perfectionistic self-presentation. “Internalized pressure to have [a] slim-thick body type can lead to risky body modification practices, such as waist trainers and plastic surgery…that have no benefit to one's health and are solely about appearance,” Mills tells Yahoo Canada. If we want to protect young people from the negative effects of over-consuming these images, Mills says regulations around how social media platforms collect data and “use tricks to hack into our attention span” could become essential. “People should get to choose what they look at,” she says. “The combination of the current business model of social media and the way humans naturally think and feel makes it hard for people to ignore all the images around them. For some vulnerable people, that is going to lead to mental health problems.” Mills also suggests being proactive in monitoring our social media use if we want to try and avoid the harmful impacts of constantly being bombarded with this unrealistic, unattainable imagery. “Set your own limits, take a break from social media and the news,” she recommends. “Be mindful about the effect that your internet and social media use have on how you feel about yourself and your life.” Let us know what you think by commenting below and tweeting @YahooStyleCA!

2/3/2022,"California and Florida are considering revoking a policy that has encouraged homeowners to install rooftop solar panels — causing fear among solar panel owners and installers, and creating divisions in the environmental community. Utility companies in the two states, some sympathetic politicians and even some environmental advocacy groups are taking aim at subsidies to purchase and install solar panels because they say those costs are ultimately passed on to other ratepayers. The crux of the issue is a practice called “net metering,” in which the electricity solar panel owners send back to the grid is removed from their monthly bill. The credits are applied at the same retail rate at which electricity is sold to consumers. That’s a higher rate than the wholesale price at which utilities buy electricity from large-scale producers. For example, if the retail rate is 30 cents per kilowatt hour, the amount a utility would pay a bulk producer — like a commercial wind farm — might be 15 cents per kilowatt hour. The difference covers the costs of building and maintaining the electric grid and the utility’s other overhead costs. (Utilities’ profit margins more typically come from their capital investments.) Net metering encourages homeowners to plunk down the high upfront costs of solar panels, which often cost upwards of $15,000, because they enjoy bigger savings on their electricity bills than they would by selling energy at the lower wholesale price. As more and more solar panels are installed, the burden of paying for the utility’s overhead and grid maintenance costs grows more concentrated on non-solar customers — or, at least, so the utility companies say. In Florida, state Sen. Jennifer Bradley, a Republican, wrote a bill that would switch from utilities paying solar customers the retail price to the wholesale price, with current solar panel owners getting a reprieve for 10 years. The Miami Herald and the nonprofit newsroom Floodlight reported that a lobbyist for Florida Power & Light (FPL), the largest electric utility in the state, wrote the bill and sent the text to Bradley’s office. The measure passed the Senate Regulated Industries Committee in January by a vote of 6-2, but it has many more hurdles to clear before becoming law. Although the Republicans who have weighed in so far on the legislation have supported it, the bill is opposed by some conservatives who favor net metering. “If net metering is eliminated, it will shift rooftop solar into a luxury only affordable for the wealthy,” George Riley, the state director for Conservatives for Clean Energy and the former executive director of the Republican Party of Florida, wrote an op-ed for the website Florida Politics. “That would be a giant step backward, when we should be working to ensure that the free resource of Florida’s sunshine is available for all.” FPL and its allies argue that net metering is unfair to customers who don’t have solar panels. “The annual subsidy paid for by all FPL customers to support rooftop solar is approximately $30 million today. By 2025, that subsidy is expected to nearly triple to more than $80 million,” FPL spokesperson Lisa Paul wrote in an email to Yahoo News. “We do not oppose net metering, we oppose the subsidy received by 0.5% of our customers and paid for by the other 99.5%. We support this legislation that aims to create an equitable playing field for everyone, because left unchecked, current rooftop solar rules in Florida will cost FPL customers even more in the coming years.” (Bradley’s office did not respond to a request for an interview.) FPL also argues that it is making the transition to solar on its own. “Large-scale, universal solar is the fastest, most cost-effective way for us to bring more solar to Florida, while keeping bills low for customers over the long term,” Paul wrote. Of course, it’s in FPL’s financial interest to pay less for rooftop solar, and to maintain a monopoly on power provided to its customers. One reason only 0.5 percent of FPL customers have solar is because Florida was one of just a few states that didn’t allow homeowners to lease solar panels, so that they could pay off the cost in more affordable increments. FPL and other local utilities opposed changing that law. But changing the regulation in 2018 opened the door to a residential solar boom: There were over 35,000 residential solar installations in 2021 in Florida and it is the only state besides California that has had 100 megawatts installed in one quarter. The solar industry predicts that ending net metering will make that progress stall, because it would double the average time it takes to pay back a rooftop solar purchase from the current seven to 10 years. “We’ve seen in some states, notably Hawaii — which did this in 2015 — which essentially cratered the market,” Will Giese, the southeast regional director for the Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA), told Yahoo News. On Oahu, the most populated island in Hawaii, new solar permits dropped by more than one-third from 2015 to 2018 and the number of active solar companies on the island decreased from 300 in 2015 to 98 last year, according to GreenTech Media. In Nevada, the rate of new rooftop solar adoption went down 47 percent in 2017, the year after the state’s public utilities commission raised fixed costs on net-metering customers and reduced the price paid for the solar energy they create. In response to public complaints, the Nevada Legislature reversed the changes, and solar deployment picked up again. The SEIA also disputes the claim that net metering is leading to higher electricity rates for other consumers. “We’ve seen in states with much higher rooftop solar penetration levels, this cost shift is just not a thing,” said Giese. According to a 2016 study by the Brookings Institution, it is actually solar users who are subsidizing other customers because of those avoided costs and the other universal benefits of clean energy, like the health improvements associated with burning less fossil fuels and cleaning up the air. According to a 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center, 52 percent of American homeowners either have installed solar panels or have “given serious thought” to installing them. The most commonly cited reason they gave, cited by 96 percent of those respondents, was “to save money on utility bills.” California, which has 1.3 million home solar arrays, is also considering changes to net metering. The California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) — which is appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who called for spending over $1 billion on tax incentives for developing green energy technologies — has proposed to make the economics of home solar much less attractive. Instead of the retail rate, utilities would pay solar panel owners the “actual avoided cost,” which is a lower amount. Utilities would also collect a “grid participation charge” of $8 per kilowatt of solar-generating capacity that would pay for maintaining the grid. That would cost about $40 to $48 per month for the average residential solar panel owner. “Net metering, as currently constructed in California, due to the extremely high retail rates that we have, is literally the most expensive strategy for promoting clean energy that we have on the table today,” Matthew Freedman, a staff attorney at the Utility Reform Network (TURN), a nonprofit that advocates for the interests of utility ratepayers in California, told Yahoo News. “Retail rates are substantially higher than the cost of new [electricity] generation.” TURN argues that it is more efficient to invest in renewable energy at wholesale prices — for example, by building utility-scale solar farms. “We can get way better bang for the buck,” Freedman said. The consumer advocacy group also believes that non-solar customers are getting taken advantage of, pointing to analyses that show the standard retail Californians pay for electricity is 10 percent higher because utilities are compensating for all the revenue lost from solar panel owners by charging more to everyone. Based on that, Freedman counterintuitively maintains that reducing the cost of solar subsidies is actually essential to combating climate change, because higher electricity costs make consumers less likely to switch from fossil fuels to electric cars, stoves and heating systems. “We proposed significant reforms to the net metering program that are different from those that are contained in the proposed decision, but the general framework that is being proposed is something that we support,” Freedman said. One element of that framework, which Freedman argues will do more to help boost access to solar energy, is shifting some of the savings from ending net metering to upfront subsidies for buying solar panels to low-income households. California’s proposal has drawn criticism from many politicians and activists who are concerned about climate change. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., sent the commission a letter warning that the proposal “may impact the state’s conservation goals as we address climate change.” Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a pro-environment Republican, wrote in a New York Times op-ed that the plan “should be stopped in its tracks” and that the “grid participation charge” is really “a solar tax.” Opponents also say it’s unfair to solar consumers who expected to get the retail rate when they bought solar panels. “This is a bait and switch,” Jamie Court, a strategist for the nonprofit advocacy organization Consumer Watchdog, told the Los Angeles Times. (While the lower rates would apply to all new solar customers, existing solar customers would be allowed to keep the old rate for 15 years.) The proposal’s supporters say that non-solar consumers are already in effect paying for grid maintenance via their electricity bill and solar consumers shouldn’t be exempt from paying their fair share, especially since they tend to skew towards wealthier homeowners. “The current Net Energy Metering program disproportionately hurts lower-income Californians who don’t own homes and can’t afford rooftop solar,” Kathy Fairbanks, a spokesperson for Affordable Clean Energy for All, a coalition that includes Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), the largest utility company in California, wrote in an email to Yahoo News. That position has some support in the environmental advocacy community. The Natural Resources Defense Council, for example, has praised the plan. But most environmental organizations are closer to the solar industry’s viewpoint, which emphasizes that solar panel owners do still pay for grid maintenance because they pay the retail rate for the electricity they use, and also that solar customers the costs of grid maintenance and expansion by reducing the amount of electricity needed to generate. “We support net metering; we support rooftop solar growing in as sustained a way as possible,” Laura Deehan, state director of Environment California, an advocacy group, told Yahoo News. “What was proposed here in California would be the most backward-looking policy imaginable from our perspective. Right now, we’re racing to get to a 100 percent clean-energy future in our state as fast as possible ... and rooftop solar, paired with storage, is one of the best solutions to the current crisis that we’re in.” Deehan also notes that distributing electricity generation across millions of existing homes, rather than building new utility-scale solar in the desert, protects natural areas and makes the grid more resilient to natural disasters, which California is especially susceptible to now because of climate change. Environment California is one of 70 groups that signed a joint letter to Newsom opposing the CPUC’s proposal. “The proposed decision, as it is, has the potential to really decimate the rooftop solar market in California,” Katherine Ramsey, a staff attorney for the Sierra Club's environmental law program, told Yahoo News. Ramsey describes the grid participation charge as “very steep” and the proposed reimbursement rate for the energy exported by solar panel owners as “way too low and [it] way too suddenly drops.” “What we have proposed is a gradual transition: more like a ramp as opposed to a steep cliff,” Ramsey added. “Both consumers and the solar and storage industry need time to adjust.” The reason Ramsey raises the issue of storage is that the current challenge to a more fully solar-fueled energy grid is that solar power isn’t generated during the early evening hours when demand peaks. Freedman contends that shifting subsidies towards storage will therefore be more beneficial, while SEIA counters that utilities could try to manage demand by charging more for power at peak times. In response to an interview request, California Public Utility Commission spokesperson Terrie Prosper sent the following statement via email: “Comments from parties on the Proposed Decision have been received for this extremely important policy matter. We have two new Commissioners, one of whom has not started yet. We will provide more information once a schedule has been determined.” And, Prosper added, “The Proposed Decision is subject to revisions based on comments.” Newsom has said that unspecified changes need to be made to the CPUC’s proposal. On Jan. 11, he said at a press conference, “That draft plan that was recently released, I just had a chance to review, and I’ll say this about the plan: We still have some work to do.” In response to a query from Yahoo News, a Newsom spokesperson wrote in an email, “The Governor continues to closely monitor this issue and believes that more work needs to be done. Ultimately, the California Public Utilities Commission, which is an independent constitutional commission, will make a decision on this matter.”",U.S./Yahoo News,"Florida and California consider changes that could 'decimate the rooftop solar market,' experts say",https://news.yahoo.com/florida-and-california-consider-changes-that-could-decimate-the-rooftop-solar-market-experts-say-100018985.html
2/3/2022,"Elizabeth Buckner said her husband, Clarence, had just won big playing slots at the Horseshoe Casino, and the couple planned to have dinner together at home Sunday. Clarence Buckner had taken a seat at the table when his wife had gone to check the mail, and an armed man grabbed her and walked her back into the home, demanding money from her husband before fatally shooting him, she said. “This wasn’t right,” Buckner said. “He was a giving, loving man.” Police said they believe Buckner was targeted in a robbery at his home on 3300 Rueckert Ave. in Northeast Baltimore. Investigators have not yet made an arrest and the department has not released any suspect information. “He grabbed me and told me ‘you got 20 seconds’,” Elizabeth Buckner recalled in an interview Tuesday. “‘I followed him from the casino, I know he had the money,’” she said the gunman said. Buckner said her husband gave the gunman what he had in his pocket, but they demanded more. Buckner then said her husband managed to distract the gunman and she was able to break free and run to a neighbor’s house. By the time she got to the house, she said she heard a shot. Buckner said her neighbor called 911 and the neighbor urged her to stay. “I said I got to go back and make sure he’s OK,” she said. Buckner went back into the house to find her husband sprawled out on the floor of their living room. “I just kept asking ‘Baby, wake up, say something,’” she said. “He never moved.” Police arrived and whisked her from the home. Buckner said her husband had retired from Baltimore City Public Schools where he had worked as a cafeteria chef, and most recently worked at City Springs Elementary School in East Baltimore. Between them, she said they had 12 children, 25 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, with whom he loved to spend time. Buckner said her husband loved to gamble, and regularly went to Horseshoe on Sundays. He had a habit of postings his winnings on Facebook, she said. He often spent his winnings on jewelry, but also gifts for others. Buckner is one of 36 people killed so far this year. Police said they have made arrests in two of the homicides, but the rest remain open. A week earlier, 51-year-old Cheryl McCormack, was fatally shot in an attempted robbery in the 3900 block of White Ave., also in Northeast Baltimore, while working for a delivery service. Police also continue to investigate the killing of Chesley Patterson, a 44-year-old restaurant general manager killed on Eastern Ave. in Fells Point and James Blue, the husband of a Baltimore Police internal affairs investigator who was killed on Walker Ave. in Northeast waiting for a refrigerator delivery.

2/3/2022,"Retired Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman has sued Donald Trump and several of his allies, including his son Don Jr., over what he describes as a conspiracy to shut him up ahead of his testimony in the former president’s first impeachment trial. In court documents filed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the former head of European affairs for the National Security Council demands “long-overdue accountability” from Trump and his allies, calling them out for trying to “obstruct a constitutional proceeding by intimidating and retaliating against a key witness.” Vindman, who provided scathing testimony about Trump pressuring the Ukrainian president to smear Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential election, was relentlessly bullied by Trump and his allies ahead of the trial. The lawsuit describes it as an “intentional, concerted campaign of unlawful intimidation and retaliation against a sitting Director of the National Security Council and decorated military officer, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, to prevent him from and then punish him for testifying truthfully before Congress during impeachment proceedings against President Trump.” Where Trumpworld Got Their Cues to Attack Vindman’s Loyalty to America In addition to Trump and Giuliani, former White House deputy communications director Julia Hahn and former Trump aide Dan Scavino are singled out in the lawsuit. Fox News host Laura Ingraham, Donald Trump Jr., and Fox News are also named for allegedly helping Trump “inflict maximum damage” by spreading disinformation about Vindman. Vindman stresses in the lawsuit that the bullying campaign against him was no knee-jerk reaction on the part of Trumpworld, but a well-planned conspiracy. The people involved held “meetings to coordinate strategy regarding impeachment witnesses, including Lt. Col. Vindman,” the lawsuit alleges. The alleged conspiracy also involved “preparing, issuing, and using talking points aimed at coordinating and advancing false narratives about Lt. Col. Vindman’s loyalty to the United States; publishing, repeating, and amplifying false claims that Lt. Col. Vindman was a spy for Ukraine and had disparaged the United States to foreign officials; leaking classified information for the purpose of furthering the false disloyalty narrative; falsely accusing Lt. Col. Vindman of lying under oath; publicly removing Lt. Col. Vindman and his brother, who was serving as an attorney for the NSC, from their White House jobs; and attempting to derail Lt. Col. Vindman’s promotion to full Colonel.” Trumpists to Alexander Vindman: ‘Fuck You for Your Service’ The end goal, Vindman alleges, was for him to be portrayed as “disloyal to the United States, engaged in ‘espionage,’ and a politically motivated ‘leftist’ within the military who was insubordinate and even broke the law.” The intimidation campaign had “severe and deeply personal ramifications” for Vindman and “also left a stain on our democracy,” the lawsuit says.
