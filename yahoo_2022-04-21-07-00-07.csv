4/21/2022,"The prominent former editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a highly popular state-run Chinese media outlet, published a commentary on Saturday urging Chinese citizens to “prepare for a military struggle” in the near future.

The commentary, written by journalist Hu Xijin, came after U.S. senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and six other U.S. officials visited Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, last Thursday. The visit was strongly denounced by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, who warned that China is “firmly opposed to any form of official exchange between the U.S. and Taiwan.”

Hu, who resigned from his post at the end of last year after three decades at the newspaper, remains a vocal and influential state media figure with around 460,000 Twitter followers.

Earlier this month, Hu wrote an article for the Global Times stating that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, which China claims as a part of its territory, would be “the most serious provocation by Washington to China on the Taiwan question since the island's then regional leader Lee Teng-hui visited the US in 1996.”

On Twitter, he simultaneously wrote that Pelosi was “playing with fire” and that “there must be serious consequences for her visit.”

In his most recent comments about the highly tense U.S.-China-Taiwan situation, as reported by Newsweek, Hu asserted that there is a “very high probability” that there will “ultimately” be a “direct military confrontation.” He noted there was a ""sense of crisis"" in Taiwan.

""As the situation in the Taiwan Strait deteriorates, we must prepare for a military struggle,"" Hu wrote.

Regardless of who starts the confrontation, Hu added that any kind of “high-intensity military crisis,” even if not war, would be highly consequential.

As to whether the U.S. would aid Taiwan with military support in the event of a Chinese invasion, Sen. Graham declared on Friday during his meeting with President Tsai Ing-Wen that “every option is on the table.”

Tensions have continued to rise between China and Taiwan since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which triggered heightened speculation about the possibility of China invading Taiwan. The U.S. continues to showcase support for Taiwan by sending high-profile envoys to the island nation’s capital.

4/21/2022,"Piers Morgan has been one of Donald Trump’s most vocal advocates in the United Kingdom for years. Those years may now be over. The consistently insufferable British TV host interviewed the former president for his new show Piers Morgan Uncensored, and, judging by a very dramatic teaser Morgan tweeted out on Wednesday, it did not go well.

Vance -- Who Once Called Him an 'Idiot,' 'Noxious,' and 'Reprehensible' -- for Senate in Ohio J.D. Vance Repeatedly Cited Racism as Reason Trump Drew So Much Support in 2016 The tension seems to have arisen from Morgan pressing Trump on his false claims of fraud in the 2020 election. “It was a free and fair election,” Morgan said. “You lost.” “Only a fool would think that,” Trump, face glistening with sweat, replied. “Do you think I’m a fool?” “I do now, yeah.” Trump eventually got up and stormed off the set, though the heavily edited nature of the clip makes it difficult to tell whether he’s cutting the interview short. “Let’s finish up the interview,” he said before standing up. “Turn the camera off. Very dishonest.” Morgan elaborated on the interview in a column for the New York Post. He wrote that Trump was “VERY upset” before the interview started because someone had given him a list of things Morgan had said about him in the past few years, and they weren’t exactly positive. “He was almost foaming at the mouth and kept shaking his head slowly and menacingly at me, like Don Corleone when he felt he’d been disrespected,” Morgan wrote of Trump’s fury over Morgan having criticized his approach to Covid-19 and his fitness for office after the attack on the Capitol. Morgan writes that the only way he was able to calm Trump down was by talking about his recent hole-in-one on the golf course. The interview ultimately lasted for 75 minutes, and everything was copacetic until Morgan started talking about the 2020 election. Morgan claims that as Trump was beginning to storm off he mentioned the hole-in-one again, prompting him to briefly sit back down before getting up and leaving for good. Morgan’s interview with Trump is slated to air Monday, April 25, on Sky News and Fox Nation, Fox News’ streaming service that also features such hard-hitting content as Tucker Carlson’s new deep dive into shirtless, muscle-bound men.

4/21/2022,"(Updated with Hutchins’ family lawyer statement) Long in the spotlight for Alec Baldwin’s fatal shooting of Rust cinematographer Halyna Hutchins last October, the film’s armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed is now declaring a degree of vindication after a vital safety report’s release Wednesday. “After OSHA’s very comprehensive safety investigation involving numerous interviews and review of documents, it has concluded that production willfully failed to follow national gun safety standards, which caused this tragedy,” Reed’s lawyer Jason Bowles told Deadline on Wednesday. “OSHA found that Hannah Gutierrez Reed was not provided adequate time or resources to conduct her job effectively, despite her voiced concerns,” the Albuquerque, New Mexico-based attorney noted. More from Deadline 'Rust' Production Company Fined Nearly $137,000 For ""Willful & Serious"" Safety Violations: ""An Avoidable Loss Of Life Occurred"" 'Rust' Shooting Report From New Mexico Safety Agency Is ""On Track"" For Release This Week OSHA Investigating Accident On 'Tales Of The Walking Dead' In the damning report, Rust Movie Productions LLC and its management were hit with a maximum $136,793 fine by the New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Bureau for its “willful and serious” violation of workplace safety procedures during the filming of the indie Western. “Critically, OSHA also determined that production failed to call Hannah in to perform her armorer duties and inspect the firearm right before its use in the impromptu scene with Baldwin,” Bowles continued in his remarks for his client. “As we have stated before, had anyone from Production called Hannah in back into the church before the scene to consult with her, this tragedy would have been prevented. Hannah has also reached out to OSHA recently in an effort to provide her suggestions for changes and improvement of safety standards on sets to avoid a tragic incident in the future.” With various lawsuit filed over the killing of Hutchins — including a wrongful death action from her family against Baldwin, the Rust producers, Reed and other crew members — the Santa Fe Sheriff’s Office is still investigating what actually occurred at the Bonanza Creek Ranch set on October 21. As of yet, no one has been charged or arrested for the incident by either the cops of the local D.A. As that probe tightened, Reed herself sued Rust armorer/mentor Seth Kenney and his Albuquerque-based PDQ Arm and Prop in January of this year. Focusing on alleged negligence by Kenney seemingly mixing up live and dummy rounds, the filing in the New Mexico courts also claimed that Props Manager Sarah Zachary wanted to cover up any previous accidents. Reiterating the narrative that Reed’s father Thell Reed, an industry veteran father, has been espousing since mid-November last year that Kenney never returned hundreds of rounds of live ammo to him from another movie they worked on together, the January 12-filed suit also implicitly carried forward the “sabotage” theory that the younger armorer’s attorneys have been espousing for months. Hutchins was killed by a live bullet in a prop gun discharged by Baldwin on October 21, 2021 on the set of Rust near the New Mexico town. “I didn’t pull the trigger,” Baldwin insisted to ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos in a December 2 interview. The 30 Rock actor also told Stephanopoulos, “I have been told by people who are in the know, in terms of even inside the state, that it’s highly unlikely that I would be charged with anything criminally.” “The idea that the person holding the gun and causing it to discharge is not responsible is absurd to me,” Matt Hutchins, Halyna’s husband, told Today‘s Hoda Kotb in an interview on February 24. “Watching him I just felt so angry. I was just so angry to see him talk about her death so publicly in such a detailed way and then to not accept any responsibility after having just described killing her.” On March 11, Baldwin had his lawyers file paperwork seeking arbitration against his fellow Rust producers. Long story short, the multiple Emmy winners desires to invoke a provision in his contract that could indemnify him in all current and future lawsuits, as well as see his legal bills paid. Hutchins family lawyer Brian Panish of Los Angeles-based Panish | Shea | Boyle | Ravipudi called Baldwin’s filing and revelations of personal communications with Matt Hutchins to be “shameful.” He added: “The only action that ended the film’s production was Baldwin’s killing of Halyna Hutchins.” Today, Panish complimented OSHA for their findings and hinted at some of his own. “We are pleased that the NM OSHA report has shed some light on the workplace safety issues that plagued Rust and led to the tragic and fatal events of Oct 21, 2021,” the attorney told Deadline. “Our own investigation has found overwhelming evidence of recklessness and negligence on the part of the Rust production team and others.” Best of Deadline 2022 Awards Season Calendar - Dates For The Emmys, Tonys & More Awards Season Red Carpet Photos: Grammys, Oscars, SAG Awards & More Spring Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Sign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

4/21/2022,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota's longest-serving state senator resigned Wednesday as head of a powerful panel that oversees the Legislature's business between sessions, just days after a published report that he had exchanged scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Republican Sen. Ray Holmberg, 79, stepped down from the Legislative Management committee, saying in a statement “recent events and discussions have made it clear to me that the interim governing body of the legislature, Legislative Management, does not need to be any part of that discussion.” Holmberg will remain on the panel, but not as its chairman. “No further comments on this announcement will be forthcoming,” his statement said. He had announced in March he would not seek reelection. The Forum of Fargo reported Friday that Holmberg exchanged 72 text messages in August with Nicholas James Morgan-Derosier as Morgan-Derosier was held in the Grand Forks County Jail. The newspaper cited a jail log it obtained through a records request showing the time and date of the text messages. Morgan-Derosier was held at the time on state child pornography charges. Holmberg first told the Forum that he had read a newspaper story about the charges, then in a later interview said he had not, the Forum reported. He told the Forum that his text messages with Morgan-Derosier were related to “a variety of things,” including patio work Morgan-Derosier did for him. He also said he no longer has the text messages. “They’re just gone,” he said. Holmberg declined to speak with The Associated Press, and in a text referred all questions to his attorney, Mark Friese of Fargo. Friese, a prominent North Dakota criminal defense attorney, said Tuesday that Holmberg hasn’t been charged with any crime, and there is no indication that he will. “I know he was in the senator’s employ,” Friese said of Morgan-Derosier. “The fact that (Holmberg) knew him doesn’t say a lot in my view.” Democratic Party Chairman Patrick Hart had called for Holmberg to step down from Legislative Management and to publicly release the text messages. Holmberg was chairman of the Legislative Management committee four times during his 46-year tenure in the Legislature. The 17-member panel decides committee assignments and choses study topics that often inspire legislation. Holmberg, a retired school counselor, announced in March that he was retiring from the Legislature, a move that came as a surprise to many lawmakers and others at the state Capitol. “At age 79, the stress of a session and a campaign will only exacerbate a weakened ability to concentrate on the matters at hand and effectively recall events,” Holmberg said in a statement at the time. Gov. Doug Burgum, the state's congressional delegation, state lawmakers and others showered Holmberg with accolades at that time. GOP Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner said the only thing Holmberg can be accused of at this point is a lapse of judgement. Wardner said he spoke with Holmberg Wednesday, before Holmberg stepped down as the committee chairman. Wardner would not disclose details of the call. “He sent 72 messages to a bad, bad person,"" Wardner said. ""That's not illegal and until there is more information I think (Holmberg's resignation) is a step in the right direction.” “If there is any evidence of any wrongdoing we will act and we will act quickly,” Wardner said. “Right now, all we have is that it looks bad.” Holmberg also sits on the state's Emergency Commission, which allocates funding and resources in times of an emergency. The commission is comprised of the governor, the secretary of state, the chairmen of the state House and Senate appropriations committees, and the majority leaders of the House and Senate. Wardner said he would not push to have Holmberg removed from that panel at this time. Republican House Majority Leader Chet Pollert, the committee's vice chairman, will head Legislative Management until the session begins in January. Pollert also announced earlier that he is retiring. Pollert said Holmberg's decision to step down as chairman of the committee “was the right thing to do.” “Sen. Holmberg has his things he needs to deal with and we don't want it to be a distraction from the Legislature,” Pollert said. The state charges against Morgan-Derosier have been superseded by federal charges that include possession and distribution of child pornography and travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct. Prosecutors allege Morgan-Derosier possessed several thousand images and videos depicting sexually abused children. He also is accused of taking two children under the age of 10 from Minnesota to his Grand Forks home, with the intent of sexually abusing them. Lawmakers are paid $526 a month and $189 a day during a session or if they meet for a committee hearing. Legislative majority and minority leaders and the chairman of Legislative Management are paid an additional $377 monthly. Holmberg and other committee chairmen also are paid an additional $10 daily during a legislative session and $5 daily for an interim committee meeting. ___ This version corrects the details on legislative leadership pay.",U.S./Associated Press,ND lawmaker quits panel leadership after texts with inmate,https://news.yahoo.com/nd-lawmaker-quits-panel-leadership-175200307.html
4/21/2022,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Wednesday asked people to not buy or use certain dietary supplement products sold with variations of the names 'Artri' or 'Ortiga' as they may contain some potentially harmful ingredients not mentioned on their labels. The agency said its laboratory analyses revealed some of the products contain dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium and methocarbamol, which is a muscle relaxant. The products are marketed to treat arthritis, muscle pain and other conditions and are sold online and in some retail stores, the agency said. The FDA said it found the hidden drug ingredients in Artri Ajo King, Artri King, Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey and Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey Extra Forte products. The FDA in January had first issued a warning about Artri Ajo King, asking consumers not to purchase the product sold for joint pain and arthritis on various websites, including Amazon.com. The agency said it has received reports of adverse events including of liver toxicity and death, associated with the use of Artri King products since the warning. The Artri King products are made by supplements maker NaturaMex. Dexamethasone could cause serious adverse events including infections and elevated sugar levels while diclofenac sodium could lead to heart attack and stroke or gastrointestinal damage, the FDA warned on Wednesday. Methocarbamol may cause dizziness and low blood pressure, it said.

4/21/2022,"A former Virginia school administrator claims she was “forced out” of her job after a “slip of the tongue” during a racial training exercise. Now, she’s suing the school district. The lawsuit filed this month by Emily Mais alleges that white employees in the Albemarle County Public School system were placed in a “no-win” situation when they participated in racial equity training. Mais, a former assistant principal at Agnor-Hurt Elementary School in Charlottesville, claims that she was retaliated against for questioning the “anti-racist” program designed for educators. Four Years After Deadly Rally, Charlottesville Nazis Are Headed to Court In November 2020, Albemarle County public schools introduced a mandatory online class about the district’s anti-racism policy for teachers, according to Mais’ lawsuit. The training was based on Glenn Singleton’s Courageous Conversations about Race, a handbook that provides educators with an understanding about racial equity and the systemic implications of racism. But Mais, who is white, claims in the lawsuit that “instead of training faculty members to embrace students of all races, [the Albemarle County School Board] uses a teacher-training curriculum that promotes racial division and encourages racial harassment.” She also asserts that the district implied that if anyone was opposed to the new training methods they should find a new job. During the last training session in June 2021, the lawsuit says Mais accidentally used the term “colored people” instead of “people of color” while making a comment during the presentation. The suit claims Mais immediately apologized for the derogatory term but was verbally attacked by a teaching aide for her poor word choice. Mais was then asked to attend meetings with the school guidance counselor, an equity specialist, and the district’s superintendent and assistant superintendents. Students Give School Board ‘Wokeness Checker’ an Earful After Anti-Migrant Crusade Mais alleges in the lawsuit that she was specifically targeted because she’d questioned the training exercise, and then accused by colleagues of being racist and needing additional equity training. In September, she said she was pushed to resign “from a job that she loved to preserve her mental health” because of the treatment she’d received from colleagues, according to the lawsuit. As part of her suit, the former assistant principal wants back pay, front pay, and unspecified damages for her “pain and suffering.” Mais’ legal team, Alliance Defending Freedom—a conservative Christian legal advocacy group—did not immediately return The Daily Beast’s request for comment Wednesday. According to the district website and its anti-racism mission, Albemarle County Public Schools is “committed to establishing and sustaining an equitable community…to ​end the predictive value of race and ensure each individual student's and staff's success.” District spokesperson Phil Giaramita told The Daily Beast that the school system adopted its anti-racism policy in 2019. What Happened to All Those Racist Statues We Took Down? “We have a strategic plan that talks about values. …Equity has been an important one,” Giaramita said. “Our racism policy is very consistent in what we say our principles and values are as a school division. …We’re talking about equity of opportunity. Every student should have the same opportunity, an equal opportunity to achieve their highest level. That’s really what the policy is designed to ensure.” Mais’ lawsuit equates the Albemarle anti-racist training to critical race theory and slams the program for not teaching about the concept of colorblindness—which negates cultural diversity—but instead uplifting a “color conscious” curriculum. Despite Mais’ grievances, Albemarle County Public Schools says her legal team has yet to officially serve the lawsuit to the district. Read more at The Daily Beast.

4/21/2022,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — During its 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran embraced the protest cry of “neither East nor West,” rejecting both the U.S. and the Soviet Union, then locked in the Cold War. The phrase to this day hangs over the doors of Iran’s Foreign Ministry. Russia’s war on Ukraine, however, has exposed just how much Tehran has tilted toward Moscow in recent years as the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers stoked decades-old, hard-line anger at America. Members of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard train on Russian surface-to-air missile systems and aircraft. Hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi visited Russian President Vladimir Putin on one of his first trips abroad. The war also exposes deeper fault lines even within Iran’s domestic politics. Among ordinary Iranians, there is a great deal of sympathy for Ukraine, a nation that staged a pro-democracy “Orange Revolution” similar to the “Green Revolution” that shook Iran more than a decade ago but was forcefully put down. Iran’s historic enmity with Russia has combined with a wider feeling among some that backing Moscow betrays the Islamic Republic’s often-stated message that it stands against the world’s major powers. “We have to help oppressed people of Ukraine as we do support people of Palestine and Yemen simply because they are targeted by powers,” said Zohreh Ahmadi, a mother of two in downtown Tehran’s Sarcheshmeh neighborhood. “A bullying power is killing children and women in Ukraine.” Iran's state-controlled television network, whose English-language service Press TV describes itself as “the voice of the voiceless,"" hews close to Russian talking points. It used Moscow's euphemistic term “special operation” to describe the war's early days. Stories referencing the killings of civilians in Bucha by Russian forces include headlines falsely describing it as a “fake attack” or “provocation” on Press TV's website. Part of the Iranian government's anger at Ukraine likely stems from the aftermath of the Guard's 2020 shooting down of an Ukrainian airliner, which killed 176 people on board. Tehran denied for days it shot down the plane before saying troops made a mistake after Iran fired ballistic missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq in response for the killing of a top general. Ukraine’s criticism of Iran grew more direct as time went on. That’s something Tehran’s Friday prayer leader, Kazem Sedighi, mentioned in a March sermon after Russia began its war on Ukraine. “In the case of the airplane, Ukraine misbehaved against us and misused it in support to the U.S.,” Sedighi said. He also engaged in the “whataboutism” common in both Iranian and Russian state media — bringing up a separate topic to charge hypocrisy while deflecting the issue at hand. “Wars claim the lives of innocent people in Yemen and Syria but there is huge propaganda over Ukraine and this is racism,” Sedighi said. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, said his nation opposed “war and destruction” while blaming America for the conflict. He also brought up a longtime suspicion that he shares with Putin — that the U.S., rather than ordinary citizens, fuels what he described as the “color coups” that back democracy. For Khamenei, it is memory of the Green Movement protests that followed Iran's disputed 2009 presidential election that directly challenged the theocracy he leads. Iran's security services used violence and mass arrests to put down the demonstrations. But unrest has re-emerged in recent years over economic issues. For Putin, it is Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution and its later Maidan protest movement that dislodged the Kremlin-leaning politician Viktor Yanukovych. But others from within Iran’s Shiite theocracy have raised concerns about Tehran’s stance on the war. Mohsen Aminzadeh, a former deputy foreign minister under reformist President Mohammad Khatami who was later imprisoned after the disputed 2009 election, went as far as to call Iran’s position “very bad” in a recent interview. “It was possibly the worst, the most passive stance of Iran’s diplomacy since 1979,” Aminzadeh recently told the monthly magazine Ayandeh Negar. On the streets of Tehran recently, 17 people were willing to speak to an Associated Press journalist about the war, with others declining. Of them, 12 supported Ukraine, three reiterated Iran’s official stance and two supported Russia. “I support Ukraine,” said Sajjad, a 26-year-old computer programmer. Like others, he spoke on condition he be identified only by his first name for fear of reprisals. “Russians are killing innocent people for nothing. Why should we remain silent?” A retired Iranian captain, Mehrdad, called Russia’s reasons for the war “ridiculous” and similar to those used by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to launch a bloody eight-year war on Iran in the 1980s. Saddam at the time pointed to supporting Iran’s Arab minority in its oil-rich southwest as a justification for his invasion. “It is stealing Saddam’s reasons for attacking Iran; possible threats by revolutionary Iran and supporting an ethnic group,” said Mehrdad, 75. “By this excuse, every country can attack others — even Russia.” Ali Nemati, a 64-year-old retired teacher, praised Putin as “very brave” for challenging NATO, also a new preoccupation of Iran’s hard-line government under Raisi. However, Iran has been living quietly next to Turkey, which joined NATO in 1952. “Iran should support Russia since it is alone in its fight against imperialism,” Nemati said. However, in its imperial past, Russia fought multiple wars against Persia, which ceded territory to the czar. Russia invaded Iran alongside Britain in World War II to secure oil and trade routes in their war against Germany. After the war, Russia refused to leave, sparking the first global crisis of the newly formed United Nations. That memory hasn't faded. Russia's brief use of an Iranian air base amid the war in Syria, in which both backed embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad, similarly sparked widespread anger. Now, Iran may be feeling like a poker chip in a wider game rather than a player at the geopolitical table. A sudden demand by Russia for sanctions-relief guarantees threw negotiations in Vienna over Iran's tattered nuclear deal into disarray. Russia's demand seems to have eased, while now it appears American sanctions on the Guard remain the last hurdle. Iranians have noticed Russia's gambit. “The point that Putin made a strategic mistake and sent forces to Ukraine and is now drowning in an Ukrainian quagmire cannot be a (logical) reason for Russia to take the deal as hostage,"" the conservative daily newspaper Jomhouri Eslami said in a March editorial. Taxi driver Abbas Najafi suggested Iran stay out of it all together. “It is not our war. It is not our problem,"" he said. ""We are under the U.S. sanctions now and we should not look for more headaches.” ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.",World/Associated Press,"In Iran, Russia's war on Ukraine is a political flash point",https://news.yahoo.com/iran-russias-war-ukraine-political-060417201.html
