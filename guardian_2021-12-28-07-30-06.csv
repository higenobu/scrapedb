12/28/2021,"Jürgen Klopp believes Liverpool can overtake Manchester City in the race for the Premier League title providing his players “defend at the top level” for the rest of the season. Liverpool can reduce the gap on the champions back to three points with victory at injury-hit Leicester on Tuesday, when Klopp will have Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho, Thiago Alcântara and Curtis Jones available following their return from Covid isolation. The game at the King Power Stadium marks the halfway point of Liverpool’s campaign and their manager, while acknowledging the ominous challenge presented by City, is confident his team’s improvement can deliver a second league title in three seasons.  “I think it’s possible, that’s what we should think because that is why we are here, but it is absolutely difficult,” said Klopp on the task of finishing above Pep Guardiola’s side. “The consistency the boys show is incredible but that is the only chance you have. In a league with probably the best team in the world it is really tricky to be ahead of them. So far, at least, we are not completely out of reach. It is not like we have no chance anymore, but of course you know City won’t drop a lot of points so you better not drop a lot of points yourself. “What do we have to do better? First and foremost we have to defend at the top level. On top of that we have improved a lot football-wise: we play some really good stuff and we are more difficult to defend against than we maybe were in the past. Some good steps. Will that be enough? I have no idea. Without being at least as consistent as we have been we have no chance. If we really want to go for a big one then we have to be even more consistent.” Klopp is reluctant to compare Liverpool’s current form to the title-winning campaign of 2020 but admits his squad has improved in certain aspects. “I hope I don’t eat my words but we are more stable than we were in the past,” he said. “We have to stay like this, at least. That is the minimum. We have to play flexible football, direct football, creative football, to defend rock solid and to force things as well in games up until the last second. We had periods in games when we were 2-0 up and the opponent came back. The things we don’t do right we have to learn from, and that is what this group always did. It gives some reason to be optimistic but of course opponents are incredibly strong and even when they are not flying they win the games.” It was four years ago on Monday that Liverpool confirmed the transformative £75m signing of Van Dijk from Southampton. The defender’s return to fitness and form after nine months out with a cruciate ligament injury strengthens Klopp’s belief that his team can defend at the level he considers necessary to win a title. “He’s now back to his best for sure. What helps us a lot and what helps him a lot is that we have options around that we don’t have to push him through the moments when his body is giving a sign that he needs to step aside,” said Klopp. “That’s why the situation is very good. Virgil’s arrival was obviously a big day in our common history and it is a good example for a winter transfer and how it works. “A winter transfer works when you either wanted to sign a player the summer before or the summer after. We wanted Virgil in the summer, for some reasons we couldn’t do the transfer, but then in the winter we tried again and could get it through. It was a very important day, it changed a lot for us. All of a sudden we could defend in a different way. We could make the pitch smaller for the opponent, so that was pretty helpful.” Liverpool have Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané and Naby Keïta available for the Leicester game as well as for Sunday’s visit to Chelsea after their departures for the Africa Cup of Nations were delayed.",Sport/Football,Klopp insists Liverpool’s defending the key to overhauling Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/27/klopp-insists-liverpools-defending-the-key-to-overhauling-manchester-city
12/28/2021,"For much of the evening Ralf Rangnick’s grimace suggested that Manchester United’s manager was suffering from severe toothache. Instead of following the supposed script and pressing a Newcastle United side which has won only one game all season into submission, Rangnick’s disjointed team were frequently pulled apart by Allan Saint-Maximin’s attacking manoeuvres and Joelinton’s midfield excellence. Although Edinson Cavani stepped off the bench to rescue a point for United the period between Saint-Maximin’s seventh minute opener and the Uruguayan’s 71st minute equaliser must have ranked among Rangnick’s least comfortable technical area interludes.  After getting his tactics so right for so long Eddie Howe deserved to see his side register a transformative victory but many among a full house at St James’ Park will have departed believing, however improbably, that relegation can still be avoided. As if Howe did not have sufficient pre-match problems to contend with, he was able to name only eight substitutes, including two goalkeepers, on the home bench with an amalgam of Covid and injuries cited as the reason. In contrast, Rangnick had been more concerned about who to leave out after 25 fully-fit senior United players trained on the eve of what was the club’s first game for more than a fortnight. His eventual starting XI looked formidably strong but swiftly proved more than a little ring rusty. When Raphaël Varane turned in unusually ponderous fashion, he forfeited possession to Sean Longstaff and in a blink of an eye Allan Saint-Maximin had the ball at his feet and was sashaying beyond three makers, Harry Maguire included. For a moment it seemed as if the Frenchman had delayed his shot too long, but instead Saint-Maximin had merely been picking his spot in the top corner. As the ball curved imperiously beyond a helpless David De Gea, Cristiano Ronaldo could not help but look impressed. Tellingly, Howe had directed some gentle criticism at the slightly out of sorts Saint-Maximin last week, and the former Nice winger appeared on a mission to prove a point. It left Maguire, Varane and company struggling to cope with his devastating, and thoroughly destructive, change of pace. Results may have disappointed since Howe succeeded Steve Bruce, but his man management has certainly brought the best out of an apparently re-invented Joelinton. Once again operating at the heart of midfield rather than at centre-forward, the Brazilian delighted in dispossessing a startled Scott McTominay on several occasions. The deeper Joelinton dropped as the game wore on the better he got, in several instances serving as a quasi sweeper, protecting his defence from danger by stealing from the toecaps of opponents, in one instance an advancing Diogo Dalot. Joelinton’s presence as a reborn enforcer also protected Jonjo Shelvey, permitting his fellow midfielder to concentrate on finding gaps in Rangnick’s rearguard. Accordingly De Gea needed to react smartly to divert Shelvey’s 25-yard shot at a moment in the game when Ronaldo’s expression had turned slightly sullen. Alarmingly for the visitors’ manager, there seemed a lack of telepathy between Ronaldo, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford. It hardly helped their cause that Bruno Fernandes was strangely ineffective in a thoroughly overrun midfield in a rather awkward and impractical formation. When Saint-Maximin wrongfooted three visiting defenders and Callum Wilson’s first time shot eluded De Gea’s grasp, St James’ Park erupted in ecstasy. Fortunately for Rangnick, that “goal” was disallowed for offside, but it was clear something was very wrong. It was Howe’s misfortune that it proved one of Wilson’s final acts as, on the brink of half-time, his most reliable goalscorer hobbled off with a nasty looking ankle injury and Jacob Murphy trotted on. As Saint-Maximin morphed into Newcastle’s central striker, Murphy went wide left, and Longstaff shifted into a slightly more advanced midfield role, as Rangnick made a double substitution, introducing Jadon Sancho and Edinson Cavani at the expense of Fred and Greenwood. His side would have been two down early in the second period, though, had Saint-Maximin not proved he is human after all by shooting weakly straight at De Gea after being set up by Emil Krafth’s right wing advance. Howe’s anguished body language emphasised it was the sort of miss that can change games, but Rangnick perhaps thought the same about the chance Sancho’s cut back conjured for Cavani to side foot wide. Ronaldo also volleyed wide – and was arguably lucky to receive merely a yellow card for a wild off the ball swipe of a boot at Ryan Fraser. Cavani eventually raised the tone by peeling away from his marker and meeting Dalot’s cross. Although his initial shot was blocked it deflected kindly for one of the game’s supreme opportunists and, with Martin Dubravka stranded, United were level. When the impressive De Gea saved brilliantly from the substitute Miguel Almiron, Howe knew it was not his night.",Sport/Football,Cavani salvages draw for Manchester United as Newcastle show new fight,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/27/newcastle-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report

In South Africa preparations have begun for a week of mourning the 26 December death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the anti-Apartheid hero described by Bob Geldof as “one of the greatest men of our time” in a piece for the Guardian yesterday. And, despite the spectre of Covid, the Ashes are on for the third Test today, with Australia leading the series 2-0. You can read all about that from people who didn’t have to look up either the current score or whether it to call today’s game a “Test” or a “match” right here from 10.30am. Now, on to the reads. Probably, argues “mask nerd” Aaron Collins. Why? Because while cloth and surgical masks certainly offer protection (especially when people wear them properly), other options can be between five and 10 times better.How does he know? “I embarked on a year-long mission to test, document, and review the best masks I could find. This eventually entailed building a mini aerosol laboratory in my bathroom, with scientific instruments capable of measuring particles 1/50,000th the width of a human hair.” That’s really up to you but reading this dive into data transparency around the crowdfunded Australian vaccine is probably a good first step. How long will it take? You can read the whole thing in about five minutes. It’s worth every second to learn about a local vaccine candidate many have never heard of, but that thousands of Australians put their money into.

It was a test by the Swiss army veterinary service that involved airlifting horses via helicopter.Notable quote: “I couldn’t include the helicopter in the shot, as the cable was too long – almost 30 metres – but I think it gives the photograph a surreal air, just seeing a horse suspended like that,” the photographer said. “It is a very strange image. I think it is improved by not having the context of the helicopter.” For the Waifs, it involved being called onstage to sing with Bob Dylan – well after their after-party had started.Notable quote: “Donna and I stripped off to our undies, cracked open a bottle of vodka and started up with the guys in the band to celebrate the tour’s wrap,” Vikki Thorn says. “We were a few shots in and feeling a little inebriated when Dylan’s stage manager burst through the door, announcing: ‘Stage lights down – Bob’s waiting for you two.’” John Crace shares the astonishing story of his heroin addiction and the friends who pulled him back from the brink.How long does it take to read? About four minutes.Notable quote: “It took time for relationships to mend, for former friends and members of my family to trust that my recovery wasn’t yet another flash in the pan.
