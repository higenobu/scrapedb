3/31/2022,"Vladimir Putin has demanded payment in roubles for Russian gas sold to “unfriendly” countries, setting a deadline of 31 March. It is not clear whether he plans to tear up existing contracts that set the price in euros or dollars, but Germany, which relies on Russia for 40% of its gas supplies, is not taking any chances, warning large industrial gas users that a standoff is possible and rationing is one possible outcome. Here we ask why payment for Russian exports in roubles has become a major issue for the Kremlin, and whether Putin could extend the plan to include exports of oil, grain, fertilisers, coal, metals and other key commodities. In the aftermath of the Russian invasion the value of the rouble fell off a cliff. It fell from about 85 to the euro last year to 110 as the tanks rolled across Ukraine’s borders. Only an intervention by the Russian central bank it stood at 94.1 to the euro. With the rouble trading at such low levels, Russian exports were going to bring in less money to subsidise state services and fund the war than previously expected. A higher valued rouble will not only bring in more cash, it is also a matter of pride that trading nations are prepared to pay for Russian exports in the Russian currency. A larger pool of roubles, generated by the demand from foreign countries and companies for Russian goods, would allow Moscow to challenge the US dominance, via the dollar, of global money markets, although it is not clear why China would support such a plan. Some analysts have also speculated that dollars and euros are less useful to Moscow while sanctions are tightening. For instance, without access to dollars and euros via international exchanges, Russia is also proposing to pay the interest on its euro-denominated debts with roubles. Russia’s list of “unfriendly” countries corresponds to those that have imposed sanctions. Deals with companies and individuals from those countries must be approved by a government commission. The countries include the US, EU member states, the UK, Japan, Canada, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland and Ukraine. Some, including the US and Norway, do not buy Russian gas. In 2020, the EU was Russia’s primary trade partner, accounting for 37.3% of the country’s total trade in goods with the world. Meanwhile, Russia was the EU’s fifth largest trade partner, representing 5.8% of the bloc’s total trade. However, this disguises the important fact that Russian gas is a major feature of those imports, most of which is paid for in dollars, euros or sterling. According to Gazprom, 58% of its sales of natural gas to Europe and other countries as of 27 January were settled in euros. US dollars accounted for about 39% of gross sales and sterling about 3%. Commodities traded worldwide are largely transacted in dollars or euros, which together make up roughly 80% of worldwide currency reserves. In practical terms, while gas imports to the EU from Russia are volatile, they account for up to €800m (£680m) of spending every day. It wasn’t enough for Russia’s central bank to buy roubles to prop up the currency in its darkest hours after the invasion. An effective ban on the central bank using the Swift payments system to access its assets held overseas meant this intervention could not last. The central bank wanted to sell dollar and euro investments to buy roubles, increasing demand and consequently the price, but without access to Swift was unable to continue on a sufficient scale. Another route was found. A directive was slapped on exporters, including commodity producers, forcing them to convert into roubles 80% of the foreign currency they receive on export sales. Now the Kremlin is considering plans for all export sales to be in roubles, exploiting its near monopoly in the essential raw materials in manufacturing processes, from fertilisers to cars. One example is nickel, which car companies use to make catalytic converters. About 40% of the world’s supply of the metal comes from Russia and 90% of Russia’s output goes to the car industry, says Paul Watters, the head of corporate research at S&P Global Ratings. If carmakers are forced to chose between buying nickel in roubles or looking elsewhere for supplies, it is likely politicians, keen to isolate Russia, will tell them to look elsewhere. Watters fears rationing and car factory closures could be the result. If the Kremlin insists current contracts in euros and dollars are changed to roubles, they will be in breach of international protocols. This is not something Gazprom has invoked, even during the cold war when tensions were heightened between the Soviet Union and the west. Germany has said it is prepared to ration energy supplies rather than pay for gas in roubles, which is likely to plunge the EU’s largest economy into recession but deny Russia the extra cash. The Kremlin move is also likely to hasten a switch away from Russian commodities, adding to the country’s already-dramatic economic decline.",News/Business,Why is Vladimir Putin demanding Russian gas is paid for in roubles?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/31/why-is-vladimir-putin-demanding-russian-gas-is-paid-for-in-roubles
3/31/2022,"Almost 500 “ghost flights” a month departed from the UK between October and December 2021, data has revealed. The information, obtained through a freedom of information request by the Guardian, shows Heathrow, Aberdeen, Manchester, Stansted and Norwich were the top five airports for such flights during the period. Ghost flights are defined as those with no passengers, or less than 10% of passenger capacity. The data from the Civil Aviation Authority includes only international flights leaving the UK and not arrivals, or any domestic flights. Flying is one of the most carbon-polluting activities people can undertake, and ghost flights have angered those campaigning for action on the climate crisis. Almost 15,000 ghost flights left the UK between the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 and September 2021, the Guardian revealed in February. The German airline Lufthansa said in January it would have to fly 18,000 “unnecessary” flights by March. Such flights have been blamed on the system at busy airports whereby airlines must normally run 80% of their flights, empty or not, to retain their landing slots. The rule was suspended during the pandemic and reintroduced at 50% in October 2021, but that did not appear to have significantly changed the number of monthly ghost flights. Tim Johnson, of the Aviation Environment Federation, said: “UK airline average occupancy grew significantly in the last six months of 2021, although November’s peak at around 70% is still significantly below the 86% achieved before the pandemic. But this hasn’t altered the number of ultra-low occupancy flights in our skies each month. “If changing market fortunes can’t solve this problem then the government must act to do so,” he said. “Its recent claim earlier that aviation can be net zero by 2050 while accommodating a 70% increase in passenger numbers (from 2018 levels) stretches belief when there are such obvious examples of inefficiency in the current system. Fixing these should be a priority.” The government regulates aviation but no data is made public on the number of ghost flights. Only the airlines know the true number, but have not provided this data when asked by the Guardian. “The public deserves transparency,” said Sarah Olney the Lib Dem MP and transport spokesperson. “They are not getting it from an industry keeping this nefarious practice hush-hush, and ministers have to share the blame for this serious vacuum of accountability. A government review into ghost flights is long overdue.” Alex Sobel, a Labour MP and chair of the net zero all-party parliamentary group, said: “Although international travel has recovered somewhat, and there’s no need to fly empty planes to hubs or for maintenance, airlines don’t seem to have given up their climate-degrading practice of ghost flights.” A parliamentary petition calling for an end to such flights has been signed by 14,000 people. The Department for Transport said: “We acted swiftly [during the pandemic] to prevent empty aircraft needing to fly to retain their slots, however some flights may operate with low passenger numbers for a whole range of reasons, including carrying key workers or vital cargo.” Airlines UK, the trade body for UK-registered airlines, said: “The [CAA] figures reflect two things – refreshed travel restrictions to combat the Omicron variant, leading to flights from destinations like Morocco and the far east bringing UK travellers home. Passenger aircraft have also been widely used as freighters during the pandemic, and even though these flights are carrying essential freight and supplies, including PPE, they would be inaccurately classed as ‘ghost flights’ in this analysis.”",News/Environment,"Ghost flights from UK running at 500 a month, data reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/31/ghost-flights-from-uk-running-at-500-a-month-data-reveals
3/31/2022,"Private jets linked to Russian oligarchs and officials appeared to continue flying into and out of EU and UK airports despite flight bans and sanctions imposed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a Guardian data investigation found. The investigation, in collaboration with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), identified and tracked jets linked to sanctioned businesspeople and officials including Roman Abramovich, Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov, a former Russian deputy prime minister. While some plane movements appeared to comply with airspace bans and sanctions, including asset freezes, others appeared to escape restrictions. Guardian analysis also showed jets linked to Russians under sanctions flew to the United Arab Emirates in greater numbers during the week after the start of the invasion than any other week of 2022. The UAE is popular with Russians as a finance and leisure centre. Jets linked to Shuvalov were tracked flying into and out of EU airports after sanctions were imposed by the bloc on 23 February, the day before Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. His Bombardier Global Express jet, registration LX-ABC, made several flights between Geneva, Munich, Paris, Milan and Helsinki after that date, according to data provided by the flight tracking service Flightradar24. The records do not include details of who was on board the plane, which typically sells for $10m (£7.6m). EU sanctions rules allow those targeted by the restrictions to make payments to meet “basic needs” such as legal fees but do not mention expenses associated with the movements of private planes, such as buying jet fuel. The Uzbekistan-born billionaire Usmanov, a major sponsor of Everton football club and a former 30% shareholder in Arsenal, is linked to two other multimillion-pound jets. Both planes flew out of EU airports after “Russian-owned, Russian-registered or Russian-controlled aircraft” were banned from EU airspace by the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, according to data from ADS-B Exchange, a website that collects live aircraft transponder data. Usmanov’s Airbus A340, the commercial version of which can seat 370 passengers, left Munich on the evening of 28 February and was last recorded descending over Tashkent that night. The jet, which is decorated with distinctive maroon livery, cost between $350m and $500m and is one of the largest private jets in Russia, according to the US Treasury, which said its tail number, M-IABU, stands for “I’m Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov”. The flight took place the day after the EU flight ban was imposed and the same day Usmanov was added to the bloc’s sanctions list. The second jet left Florence in Italy the same day and was also heading towards Uzbekistan when the transponder signal was lost over Turkmenistan. A spokesperson for Usmanov said sanctions against him were based on “incorrect” assumptions about his relationship with the Kremlin, adding that his assets, including private jets, had been transferred to irrevocable trusts long before sanctions were imposed against the billionaire. “[We] deny there was any wrongdoing or attempt to avoid any assets being sanctioned,” the spokesperson said. “Given the fact that the MI-ABU jet you invoked is not owned or controlled by Mr Usmanov, and could only be used by him on lease terms, there is no legal grounds for any ban on it in relation to the individual sanctions imposed against him. “Regarding compliance with the rules of aircraft departures, our detailed legal analysis found no violations. To the best of our knowledge, the departure was made in accordance with the permission of the authorised authority of the country from which the aircraft departed.” The spokesperson did not respond to an inquiry about whether Usmanov was onboard either of the flights. While some of the jets remain out of the reach of authorities despite being linked to oligarchs under sanctions, other aircraft have already been seized or barred from flying.Jets linked to Abramovich have also been active in the weeks since the Ukraine invasion, which has resulted in the Chelsea FC owner being sanctioned by the UK and the EU. One, a Bombardier Global 6000, registration LX-LUX, is now grounded in Latvia, denied permission to leave by the authorities pending confirmation of its ownership by authorities in Luxembourg, where the plane is registered. If it is found to belong to Abramovich, who has been linked to at least three other private jets, it will be considered a frozen asset, Aivis Vincevs, of Latvia’s Civil Aviation Agency, told the news website Re:Baltica. A close associate of Abramovich, Eugene Shvidler, has also had two jets seized by UK authorities, at London Biggin Hill and Farnborough airports. One jet had flown from Biggin Hill to Farnborough on 27 February, according to the Flightradar24 data. The jet also made a transatlantic flight to a small airport outside New York later on 27 February, returning to Farnborough on 4 March. A UK flight ban on Russian aircraft came into effect two days earlier. A spokesperson for Shvidler said there had “never been any breaches” and that he was not a Russian citizen and did not have any ties to the Kremlin. Aircraft that visited the UAE include some of those linked in previous reports to Abramovich and the Ukrainian opposition politician Viktor Medvedchuk, as well as Russian businesspeople Andrey Guryev, Andrey Melnichenko and Oleg Deripaska. The UAE has been described as the “Switzerland of the Persian Gulf” by organisations including Tax Justice Network, owing to its high degree of banking secrecy, suggesting oligarchs barred from other financial centres may have travelled there to organise their financial affairs. A jet reportedly linked to Melnichenko, a billionaire whose superyacht was seized by Italian authorities earlier this month, flew to Dubai on 9 March, according to Flightradar data. The Boeing 737 is currently under investigation in Luxembourg, where it is registered. A spokesperson for Melnichenko said he was an international self-made entrepreneur who had “no relation to the tragic events in Ukraine”. “He has no political affiliations. There is no justification whatsoever for placing him on any sanctions lists.” A spokesperson for Deripaska said sanctions against him were “deeply misguided”. “The decision to sanction Mr Deripaska has nothing to do with justice or law, neither does the freezing of assets belonging to him or his family. Therefore, as he already stated on his Twitter account, it will be for the courts and the police to discover the true origins and beneficiaries of this decision.” Spokespeople for Abramovich, Shuvalov, Medvedchuk and Guryev did not return requests for comment.",News/World news,Jets linked to Russian oligarchs appear to have kept flying despite sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/jets-linked-to-russian-oligarchs-appear-to-have-kept-flying-despite-sanctions
3/31/2022,"The tundra of northern Norway is a long way from the Venice Biennale. Indeed, it is a long way from anywhere, at least viewed through western eyes. To reach the gentle herd of reindeer who are now feeding under the long pale glow of an Arctic sunset, I have ridden for three and a half hours across the snowy wastes, partly in a sled and partly on the back of a snowmobile, pausing halfway at a herders’ hut (no electricity, no water, but nevertheless a cosy refuge). We are somewhere off the road that links the villages of Karasjok and Kautokeino. To the north of us is Hammerfest. North of that, the Barents Sea. Artist Máret Ánne Sara is with her husband, brother and 18-month-old, the child cheerfully bundled up and goggled against the chill and the snow’s bright glare. She is telling me about the yearly passage of these, her brother’s reindeer, from the tundra up to the northern coastal summer lands, 250km away: how the biggest cow will start to move when she’s heavily pregnant, and the whole herd will inexorably, mysteriously make its way north. “It’s the animals who control everything,” she says. “We just follow them and try to keep them safe.” Her brother Jovsset Ante Sara is scattering feed as the soft-haired animals prance and jitter across the snow. That’s not a good sign: reindeer have always been able to eat lichen and moss through the Arctic winters, but the unstable climate is increasingly bringing snow that’s too deep for them to find it, as it has this year. Or, as in 2019, periods of warmth that melt the snow, so that when temperatures drop again, impenetrable layers of ice form, keeping the animals from reaching food. The tundra is changing in other ways, too: as winters get warmer, birchwoods are spreading north by as much as 50 metres a year. “When we have birch forests, the ground changes and the lichen gets pushed out,” says Sara. “If the landscape keeps changing, they won’t have any winter food.” She looks around at the short but sturdy birches. “If you look up historical photos, there are no trees here.” Reindeer herding is one of the traditional livelihoods for Sámi families such as the Saras. The Sámi are an Indigenous people scattered thinly through a vast tract of northern Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia’s Kola peninsula. Their presence long predates the Nordic settlers of these boreal lands, who now outnumber them. Their homeland is called Sápmi in the Sámi languages, nine of which survive, some clinging on to life with just a few hundred speakers. For this year’s Venice Biennale, the Nordic Pavilion will be renamed the Sámi Pavilion, and a long colonised people, divided by borders and living at the sharp end of climate crisis, will take their place as a nation for the first time at the art world’s most prominent global gathering – a gathering that, because of its exhibitions presented in national pavilions, can feel like a kind of art Olympics, always entangled in the geopolitics of the moment. What do reindeer on the tundra have to do with Máret Anne Sara’s art for the Venice Biennale? Everything. For her, reindeer are both the subject and the material of her work; indeed, they are central to life itself. For reindeer-herding families, the animals are not mere livestock. “There’s a different way of thinking and being between an Indigenous perspective and a typical western orientation,” she says. “For us, the reindeer is actually a very close relative. Humans, nature and animals are interdependent and equal. So destroying any part of this is like suicide from our perspective. What’s happening to the reindeer is our story as well.” The director of the Sámi Museum at Karasjok, Jelena Porsanger, had earlier told me how this proximity is even embedded in the northern Sámi language. “To live” – eallit – has the same derivation as the noun “herd” – eallu. It is not a sentimental relationship, though. While I’m on the tundra, a couple of reindeer are quietly and efficiently slaughtered, “for domestic use”, says Sara; and at the herders’ hut, her brother Jovsset slices chunks of dried reindeer meat as a snack. Ande Somby, a Sámi activist, lawyer and artist whom I meet in the city of Alta a few days later, tells me that between the herder and the reindeer there is a kind of contract, “that the reindeer will be given a death of dignity and everything shall be used” – bones, hide, meat, antlers. Somby is in his 60s, of the generation of Norwegian Sámi sent away to boarding school and chastised for speaking his mother tongue. Things are different now, with Sámi parliaments in the Nordic nations giving people a say in cultural, linguistic and educational matters. Somby is a yoiker: practitioner of a haunting, uncanny vocal technique in which the singer embodies, almost becomes, the subject of the yoik, which could be a person, a landscape, a wolf, or indeed a reindeer. Some of Sara’s most powerful art has been made as a means of protest. For years, Jovsset Ante Sara was locked in a legal battle over the government’s policy of culling herds because – it was argued – of overgrazing. Sara denies that overgrazing is an issue, and anyway, she says, “it is very difficult for us to accept that argument, because the government is at the same time inviting big industries into the same area”. A long history of mineral exploitation in Sápmi now also extends to building windfarms on traditional reindeer-herding lands, which spooks the reindeer and affects their traditional migratory patterns. It is complicated: clearly, now more than ever, wind energy is needed to help replace fossil fuels. But the Sámi, as so often, find themselves paying a high price for the high-carbon lifestyles of others. As Jovsset’s case against the forcible slaughter of reindeer rose through the courts, Sara’s confrontational art accompanied it. She erected a pile of 200 bloodied, frozen reindeer heads with the Norwegian flag atop it near the courthouse in Tana. In front of the Norwegian parliament building in Oslo, she made a huge sculpture, a kind of “curtain” of 400 reindeer skulls, each with a bullet hole – a work that formed part of a greater project of documents, talks and debates she called Pile O’Sapmi. Jovsset won every case until, at the last, he was defeated in the Supreme Court in 2017. “It showed how fragile we are, and how our rights are owned, totally, by the state,” says Sara. It was what happens, she says, “when an outside worldview criminalises your traditions and capitalises nature”. It is an irony, perhaps, that the new National Museum of Oslo has acquired that “curtain” of skulls and, when it opens its doors in June, this howl of protest against internal colonialism will be the first thing visitors see. Sara tells me how, some time after the legal defeat when she was at a loss to find a way forward, she was talking to another herder, describing her disappointment and exhaustion. “All of a sudden he said, ‘But now the red calf is coming. And at the first sight of the red calf, everything is forgotten.’” It was a transformational moment. What he meant was that when the new reindeer are born – “the red calves” – they bring joy and a fresh beginning. Sara’s new work takes its cue from this sense of renewal but, like everything in her art, it is shot through with darkness. The losses of calves to legally protected predators such as wolverines and eagles are huge, and her work, which often teeters on the edge of the macabre, will use their mutilated bodies as material. Pauliina Feodoroff is another artist representing Sápmi at the Venice Biennale who has a strong need to find hope in the dark. She is one of the 1,000 or so-strong Skolt Sámi community from close to the Finnish-Russian border, of whom around 300 speak the Skolt Sámi language. Feodoroff learned it in adulthood, “taking back” the tongue, like a number of her generation in their 30s and 40s. Many Skolt Sámi ancestral lands were long ago lost to the hellish, polluting nickel mines of Murmansk. But, says Feodoroff – whose background is in performance and choreography as well as politics and land guardianship – “for myself I want to focus on what is healthy and our need to be kind and gentle to ourselves and others”. Feodoroff is speaking on the edge of the river Näätämö – or Njâuddam in Skolt Sami – north of Finland’s Lake Inari. She offers a greeting to the “grandmother” river and suggests that I introduce myself to the landscape by lying near the riverbank in the snow for a moment – which I do, staring into the heavy white sky and listening to the intense silence, broken only by the caw of a crow and the fussing of a couple of willow tits in the birches. The animistic, nature-based spirituality of the Sámi did not entirely die with the aggressive Christianising process of the 17th century, when Sámi noaidis, or shamans, were tried for witchcraft. Later that day we cross the frozen lake Inari on sleds and enter the pristine, ancient pine forests that circle it – deep woods where the trees stand at a dignified, discreet distance from each other to take in as much of the precious Arctic light as possible. “This is our cultural monument,” says Feodoroff of the forest. “It is our cathedrals, our libraries, our museums.” She has been fighting to preserve these forests, which are threatened by logging for the pulp industry, despite their antiquity, their biodiversity and their dark green, spreading beauty. Part of her work for Venice will be a conceptual project in which she will auction the right to see views of wilderness like this, and use the proceeds to buy and protect the land in a case of art and practical activism combining. When institutional or legal processes have ground to a halt, she says, “art is a space that can cause some kind of freedom of movement”. In the forest we sit round a campfire and listen to Feodoroff’s friend, Anna Morrotaja, one of the Inari Sámi, talking about her people’s traditional singing style the livđe, an art that had virtually disappeared from her community’s culture until she researched ethnomusicological collections in Berlin and elsewhere to find recordings of long-lost family members performing for the benefit of curious anthropologists. Like the yoik, the livđe can involve creating a kind of portrait of a person. Hearing an archive recording of her great-aunt’s livđe for the first time was, then, like a personal encounter. She sings it now, in the dusk and the snow, before the campfire, and it’s an unearthly thing with a rocking rhythm like a spell, but tinged with wit, telling of an energetic woman with “fire in her hemline”. A song sung in the forest seems an enchanting and simple thing, but none of this really is simple. The Sámi were long victims of racism and prejudice. Northern Sámi activist and film-maker Siljá Somby later tells me that it’s still very much there. You can see plenty of hate speech directed at the Sámi on social media. The situation varies from country to country. Sweden has not signed the UN convention on Indigenous peoples, meaning the Swedish Sámi have fewer rights than those in Norway and Finland. For Venice, the Swedish side of Sápmi will be represented by painter Anders Sunna, another member of a reindeer-herding family that has been locked in legal battles for years with the state. Even in Norway and Finland, points out Siljá Somby, the parliaments stop short of giving them what she calls “hard rights” over land or water, only “soft rights” over culture and education. And there are plenty of divisions within the Sámi community itself. Some have little time for the sharpening, over the last 50 years or so, of Sámi political consciousness, and those elected to the Norwegian Sámi parliament have included members of the Progress party, who would see the institution itself abolished. Nor has resistance come naturally to the Sámi, who for centuries adapted themselves to circumstances. Inari Sámi reindeer herder Osmo Seurujärvi, has, like Morrotaja, immersed himself in a language and way of life that his own parents were becoming estranged from, realising that if he did not, the chain would end and his children would lose the culture for ever. “We never resist, we always bend,” he says. “When it comes to nature, that’s the right thing to do. But when it comes to social structures, it’s not always the right thing. It’s always expected that Sámi will give up and not resist. We are not a warrior nation. But we do need to have a say.” Everything is connected: this is what the Sámi tell us. The landscape, nature, the climate, politics, culture, society, the law, art – they are all entangled. Like Indigenous peoples from other parts of the world, the Sámi are at the front line of climate crisis but also the holders of knowledge; of alternative perspectives that could usefully challenge the consumerist, capitalist structures that have proved so destructive. And, as Feodoroff points out, we all rely on the Sámi and their breathtaking, expansive landscapes in more ways than we might at first think. “The forests here are storing carbon for you guys, too,” she says. “If they cease to exist, the consequences will come to your back door.”  The Sámi Pavilion at the Venice Biennale opens on 23 April.

3/31/2022,"The 15th-century chapel at Ayshford stands alone in a small, undulating field next to the Grand Western Canal. It is an unassuming building, facing slightly away from you as though preoccupied with other things, nudged aside by centuries of industrious human activity. In the early 19th century, engineers and labourers built the canal to ferry goods from Taunton to Tiverton. The canal never had a chance to live up to the grandeur of its title, cut short by the coming of the railways. The little village and the tiny stone chapel are now doubly bypassed, as the M5 thunders past, leaving this quiet stretch empty of traffic, bar the odd pottering moorhen or the Formula One flash of a kingfisher. The spring rain is fine and pervasive, so gentle it barely disturbs the pewter-grey surface of the water. We heave open the wooden door and step into the dry silence. The pews are stippled with dusty white splotches: tell-tale signs of bats in the belfry. Julia, whose family now owns the adjacent house and surrounding farm, sits down at the ancient organ and pedals it into life. It wheezes plaintively like a ghostly chorister. In one corner of the chancel is a huge stone tomb dedicated to the brief life of Henry Ayshford, who died in 1666 “aged one yeare and nine mo”. At the other end is another reminder of our mortality: an 18th-century stone carving of a reclining figure, now headless, cradling a skull. I take my phone out to click a picture, but the settings are wrong and I catch my own startled face in a selfie vanitas. The chapel still belongs to the Ayshford family, but is looked after by the wonderfully named Friends of Friendless Churches, a charity whose founders include TS Eliot and John Betjeman. Julia and her family are busy raising funds to repair the bell in time for the Queen’s platinum jubilee. Outside, the early flowers, known as spring ephemerals, have colonised the banks. Primroses, daffodils and violets make the most of their fleeting time before the trees come into leaf and gobble up the light. We walk back along the towpath through the soft rain, buoyed with renewed wonder at our ephemerality. Behind us, the cracked bell waits to be rung.

3/31/2022,"Russia is building up its forces in eastern Ukraine in readiness for a new wave of attacks in the breakaway Donbas region, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has claimed, despite the planned resumption of peace talks on Friday. In an early morning video address on Thursday, Zelenskiy said that Russia’s announcement that it was pulling troops away from cities such as Kyiv and Chernihiv had been forced upon the Kremlin by the fierce resistance of Ukraine’s armed forces. The Ukrainian leader added that his government was instead seeing “a build-up of Russian forces for new strikes on the Donbas and we are preparing for that”. The leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin, said on Wednesday that offensive operations were intensifying. Such a move would be consistent with Moscow’s claim this week about a withdrawal from some areas to focus on “liberating” the breakaway eastern Donbas region, although Zelenskiy said it was “the consequence of our defenders’ work”. The Donbas includes the besieged city of Mariupol where the Russian defence ministry announced a local ceasefire on Thursday to allow civilians to be evacuated, according to Agence France-Presse. Despite the withdrawal claims, Russian forces have continued to bombard the northern city of Chernihiv and parts of the capital Kyiv. Ukrainian military officials said they had seen some Russian units pull out but only because they had suffered heavy losses. The fate of the south-eastern Donbas region, which Russia demands Ukraine cede to the separatists, was a topic of discussion at peace talks held on Tuesday in Istanbul palace. A senior Ukrainian negotiator said on Wednesday night that the talks will resume online on Friday. Zelenskiy said the talks had produced nothing “concrete” while one of his senior aides said the Ukrainian leader could meet Putin “soon”. The head of Ukraine’s negotiating team, Mykhailo Podolyak, said that Moscow was scrutinising proposals submitted by Kyiv in Istanbul which he believed could lead to a presidential peace summit between the pair. However, a Kremlin spokesman downplayed the hopes of an early breakthrough in the peace talks. Ukraine has sought a ceasefire without compromising on territory or sovereignty, though it has proposed adopting a neutral status in exchange for security guarantees. Russia opposes Ukraine joining Nato, the western military alliance, and has cited its potential membership as a reason for the invasion. Zelenskiy also said in his TV address that he talked to Joe Biden for an hour on Wednesday during another “very active diplomatic day”. He said he thanked the US president for a new $1bn humanitarian aid package and an additional $500m in direct budget support. Zelenskiy said: “The support of the United States is vital for us. And now it is especially important to lend a hand to Ukraine, to show all the power of the democratic world.” A possible shift in the military situation in Ukraine came as the head of Britain’s spy services agency claimed that Putin has been misinformed about the extent of Russian military failure in Ukraine because his advisers are too frightened to tell him the damning truth. Sir Jeremy Fleming, in a speech given in Australia on Thursday, said the Russian leader had misjudged the strength of Ukrainian resistance, the western response and the ability of his forces to deliver a rapid victory. Fleming, whose comments were backed up by US and EU officials, said that the failure to achieve a quick victory must be causing discord in the Kremlin. “And even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime.” Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby agreed and said: “It’s [Putin’s] military. It’s his war. He chose it ... the fact that he may not fully understand the degree to which his forces are failing in Ukraine, that’s a little discomforting.” Other key developments include: The Russian defence ministry announced a local ceasefire on Thursday to allow civilians to be evacuated from Ukraine’s besieged port city of Mariupol, according to Agence France-Presse. A humanitarian corridor from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, via the Russian-controlled port of Berdiansk, would be opened from 10am (7am GMT), it said. The Biden administration is considering a plan to release roughly one million barrels of oil a day from US reserves for several months, in order to combatrising fuel prices exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, according Bloomberg. Germany has triggered the first stage of plans to ration power if the standoff with Russia over gas supplies and sanctions is not resolved. Moscow is demanding that payment for energy be made in roubles, but this could undercut western sanctions on Russia and countries are under pressure not to go along with the Kremlin’s plan. The Russian rouble has recovered to its pre-war value despite western sanctions on the country’s exports and financial systems. The currency was trading at 75.5 to one US dollar on Thursday morning, compared with almost 140 at the beginning of March when it crashed with the onest of sanctions. Zelenskiy was due to address Australian parliament on Thursday. Global restrictions on exports of industrial components to Russia have hit car and tank production. A carmaker has shut down and tank production has halted, according to the US. Baikal Electronics, a Russian semiconductor company and computer manufacturer, has been cut off from integrated circuits to support its surveillance, servers, and other domestic communications equipment. Liz Truss, Britain’s foreign secretary, is due to land in India on Thursday to urge Narendra Modi’s government to reduce its strategic dependency on Russia. Her arrival in New Delhi coincides with that of her sparring partner Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, who will be making his first visit since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Major jewellers including American brand Tiffany & Co, Swiss watch and jewellery-maker Chopard, Signet, the largest retailer of diamond jewellery, and Pandora, the world’s largest jeweller, have released statements saying they will stop buying diamonds of Russian origin. The UK has announced new laws targeting the access of Russian oligarchs to “UK aviation and maritime technical services”, according to the Foreign Office.

3/31/2022,"When Mostafa “Moz” Azimitabar received his confirmation of receipt from the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Kurdish refugee knew he could finally start calling himself an artist. Entering his self-portrait into the 2022 Archibald prize a day before deadline on Thursday, he is still slightly overwhelmed that what began as an exercise in psychological survival during six years in detention on Manus Island has developed into an artwork. “I didn’t have any experience of art, [in Iran] I didn’t have any art teacher in my life,” he told Guardian Australia. “But when I got to Manus I deeply just wanted to get away from all the noise and the guards. I found tranquility in paper, coffee and toothbrushes.” Without access to brushes and paints, these were the materials used by Azimitabar when he started making art as a detainee. After almost eight years in detention, including 14 months locked up in two Melbourne hotels after his transfer to Australia, Azimitabar finally secured his freedom in early 2021. He is now suing the Australian government for unlawful imprisonment in the Park and Mantra hotels. While initially delighted to work with real art materials for the first time, he soon reverted back to supermarket-bought coffee and toothbrushes – with the addition of some acrylic paint. “I use coffee because I want [to document] the memories of what I went through for eight years,” said the former detainee. “The coffee and toothbrushes are the small things [that represent] simplicity and resistance. They show I survived, they show I’ve continued.” Also delivering his self-portrait to the Art Gallery of NSW on Thursday was fellow Kurdish Iranian refugee and former Manus Island detainee Farhad Bandesh. During his seven-and-a-half years of incarceration, he received a regular supply of artists’ materials from Ben Quilty, whose portrait of Margaret Olley won the Archibald prize in 2011. But he too was forced to resort to coffee at times; his paints and brushes were confiscated by guards on a number of occasions. Bandesh completed more than 100 artworks while in detention, and since being released in late 2020 has had works exhibited at the Indigenous-run Blak Dot gallery in Melbourne. “The red, yellow and green on my face are the colours of my land [the Kurdistan flag],” he told the Guardian. “The blue is for the ocean I crossed to come to Australia; it says safety and freedom.” The work depicts a joyful-looking Bandesh. “Yes, I am smiling in the portrait,” he said in an artist’s statement. “Because at the same time that I am still holding the pain and trauma of what happened to me under this cruel policy, I am smiling because this is the resistance. They can beat me, insult me, hurt me but I am still strong and with my smile, I fight for my rights and for other innocent refugees.” Both Bandesh and Azimitabar worked on their Archibald entries at the studio of fellow artist, film-maker and refugee advocate Angus McDonald, who is making a documentary about their lives. The pair are also musicians and performed together in the 2021 Refugee Week concert Band Together at Sydney Town Hall in June. Bandesh is also studying viticulture in regional Victoria. The winners of the $100,00 Archibald prize for portraiture, the $50,000 Wynne prize for landscape and sculpture, and the $40,000 Sulman prize for best subject painting, genre painting or mural will be announced on 15 May. The exhibition will remain on show at the Art Gallery of NSW until 28 August and then tour regional NSW and Victoria.",Arts/Art and design,Painted with coffee and toothbrushes: Kurdish refugees enter the Archibald prize,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/31/painted-with-coffee-and-toothbrushes-kurdish-refugees-enter-the-archibald-prize
3/31/2022,"Among the pack of countries vying to act as mediators in the Russia-Ukraine war, Turkey has emerged as the winner, increasing the stature of Turkish diplomacy – even if at this stage the theatrics may be well ahead of any solid outcome. Emmanuel Macron continues his dogged round of phone calls with Vladimir Putin, but it is the Turkish foreign ministry that seems able to bring the Ukrainians and Russians together. It is a curious position. Turkey, a Nato member, continues to supply weapons to Ukraine, while refusing to impose sanctions on Russia, and yet is apparently respected enough by both sides to host Tuesday’s talks. The Turks also have a profound sense of what may be at stake. Speaking at the weekend in Doha, Ibrahim Kalin, the adviser and spokesperson to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spelled it out: “Once this is all over, there will have to be a new security architecture to emerge globally. How that global security architecture will be structured will shape the course of events for decades to come. Every step we take, every move we make to bring an end to this war will have an impact on that new security architecture.” In short, this is a set of peace talks that could have reverberations not just for the combatants, but the world. It would also be wrong to think Turkey does not have its own point of view. Kalin says: “What led to this war needs to be studied carefully. The power disequilibrium that has shaped the international order ever since the end of the cold war over the last three decades has everything to do with the rise of this crisis and eventually the war we are trying to stop now.” Although he said the war was unjustified and unprovoked, he added: “Whatever causes and grievances or security concerns Russia had going to this war have to be heard, not justified. We need to talk to Russia. If everybody burns bridges with Russia who is going to talk to them at the end of the day?” By inference, he was saying the era of American hegemony had to end. The foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, on Saturday said he believed Ukraine’s best interests lay in pursuing a balanced foreign policy. Turkey may even provide a role model of sorts, he suggested, refusing to choose between east and west – something he said Turkey had been forced to do due to its geography. The reality is more complex, and probably more self-serving. After a long period offending many in the region, Turkey – perhaps driven by economic weakness – has been mending fences. Either way, Çavuşoğlu said, “We have to find a face-saving way out or an honourable exit for both sides that they can sell publicly and globally.” The initial Turkey-hosted meeting, between Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, took place earlier this month, on the fringes of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum. It made little progress, even if Kuleba fleshed out the offer for Ukraine to drop its request to join Nato and instead adopt a neutral status in return for security guarantees provided by an unidentified group of countries. Lavrov was clearly not briefed to make serious response. But at the talks on Tuesday in Istanbul, initially slated to last two days, the Ukrainian offer became more explicit, and was delivered in writing. The Ukrainian delegation this time was headed up by the adviser to the president of Ukraine, Mihaylo Podolyak, and the Russian delegation was led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky. Kalin had been instrumental in assembling the cast list. The presence of Roman Abramovich at the talks shows how central the former Chelsea football club owner has become. Podolyak said Ukraine wanted to see China, Russia, the US, France, Turkey, Germany, Canada and Israel as the guarantor states. Their role, akin to the Nato article 5 commitment, would be to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty if threatened. It is a reworking of the Budapest memorandum of 1994. Podolyak claimed “preliminary acceptance came from some countries that we wanted to be guarantor countries”, adding he thought ground existed for a meeting hosted by Turkey, a goal alongside a humanitarian ceasefire the Turkish foreign minister said was achievable. “Nothing very promising so far” was the downbeat account from Moscow on Wednesday. But Turkey is more optimistic and thinks there is a plan capable of gaining traction. Turkey’s next aim is to get Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Putin in the same room in the next fortnight. At the moment it seems unlikely Putin thinks he is losing, or has much to gain from such an encounter. But if Turkey pulls it off, it would be an extraordinary turnaround for Erdoğan, whose autocratic tendencies had threatened to make him an international pariah.",News/World news,Turkey leads pack of countries vying to mediate between Ukraine and Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/turkey-leads-pack-of-countries-vying-to-mediate-between-ukraine-and-russia
3/31/2022,"Zimbabwe’s ruling Zanu-PF party may be facing an uphill struggle to secure a clear victory in elections due next year after a new opposition party made significant gains in byelections last weekend, raising concerns of new political instability and possible violence. The Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), which was only founded in January, won 19 out of 28 parliamentary seats in polls widely regarded as a test run for the 2023 presidential election. In 2018, a fractured opposition came within 1% of forcing President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power following the fall of President Robert Mugabe, into a runoff. The vote was marred by allegations of rigging. The CCC is led by Nelson Chamisa, who described the weekend’s results as a “landslide”. “There is nothing that will stop us from forming the next government … Yes challenges are there. Electoral reforms must be implemented, and we have said those reforms have to be put in place,” Chamisa told reporters in Harare earlier this week. Analysts say the opposition in Zimbabwe has largely unified around Chamisa, putting an end to the worst of the internecine bickering that undermined its previous efforts to win power. The gains made by the CCC at the weekend suggest a tight battle next year, with Mnangagwa likely to be forced into a runoff that he could lose. Though the CCC won most of the urban vote, taking 75 of the contested 122 municipal seats, it failed to make inroads outside towns. Overall turnout was low. Chamisa accused the ruling Zanu-PF of using underhand tactics. Party officials said traditional leaders in rural constituencies intimidated voters by forcing them to register names in a local database before voting. Electoral officials denied the accusations. “Had it not been for rigging and other shenanigans particularly in the countryside we would be talking about [winning] almost 26 out of 28 [constituencies] but … the citizens are clear and have made a bold statement,” Chamisa said. Electoral and ruling party officials denied the allegations. Though campaigning in 2018 was relatively peaceful, the polls were followed by a wave of repression with soldiers shooting civilians in central Harare and hundreds of arbitrary detentions. In campaigning for last weekends by elections, CCC supporters were teargassed or assaulted by police, several were arrested and one killed. The party was forced to obtain court orders to allow rallies to go ahead after authorities claimed there were insufficient police officers to provide security. Independent observer groups such as the Zimbabwe Election Support Network (Zesn) said some candidates’ conduct amounted to vote buying, including giving out food to voters. “The election day was peaceful but with concerns of community coercion,” Zesn said in a statement. In the southern city of Bulawayo, ruling party officials distributed sacks of maize flour before the vote, residents told the Guardian. Human rights organisations have accused the ruling party of encouraging violence. On 26 February, Zimbabwe’s vice-president, Constantino Chiwenga, said the ruling Zanu-PF party would “crush the [opposition] like lice under a stone”. A day later, a gang of unidentified men entered the centre of Kwekwe, a town 200km from Harare and a key constituency, where they attacked CCC supporters on their way to a rally. Around 20 people were injured with bottles, iron bars, spears and bricks. Mboneni Ncube, a 30-year-old man and opposition supporter died after being stabbed. Five suspects have been arrested and charged with murder. Amnesty said the attack appeared to be pre-meditated to intimidate political opposition. After the Covid restrictions were lifted in September, Chamisa began a “meet-the-people” tour. In Masvingo province and other places, Zanu-PF supporters damaged vehicles and beat villagers who came out to support him. On at least one occasion, supporters were forced to publicly denounce him and on 20 October, Chamisa’ was shot at in Manicaland province, Amnesty said. Another opposition supporter died in November after being beaten in Gutu by suspected Zanu-PF supporters. His wife and other relatives were charged with defamation after they accused ruling party members of being responsible. Before the polls,Zanu-PF officials said they were targeting the urban vote. Party spokesperson accused the opposition of “neglect, feckless maladministration, screaming corruption, and putrid decay”. “The electoral jury is out. Come the 2023 … elections, Zanu-PF envisages an electoral tsunami that will drown the foreign spawned opposition”, Mutsvangwa said in a statement broadcast by state-controlled media. In the run-up to the vote, Mnangagwa threatened to suspend the work of all NGOs – even those working to protect millions from malnutrition. Mugabe banned NGOs when he feared defeat in polls, and frequently accused aid agencies of conspiring with the opposition and usually unidentified foreigners. After Mugabe secured victory in the contested and violent election of 2008, he lifted the ban on the aid groups. The current government aim to bring in new laws that will make NGOs disclose their source of funding and ban them from activities deemed “political”. The government say that the measure aims to target “money-laundering and terrorist funding”. “We can do without NGOs. I will remove them from this country, I will chase them away,” Mnangagwa said before the byelections. Some fear a ban on aid agencies would lead to drastic cuts in humanitarian assistance, estimated at $800m a year. Blessing Vava, head of a local democracy and governance group, Crisis Coalition, said Mnangagwa was seeking “to entrench a one-party state and a dictatorship where the government does not want to be accountable”. No opposition has won an election and formed the government in the former British colony since independence in 1980. Chamisa has complained of a flawed voters’ roll and has accused the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) of transferring voters from one constituency to the other without their knowledge. “Yes, we had a landslide, but those issues are still there … Zanu-PF do not believe in a free vote,” Chamisa said.",News/World news,Zanu-PF faces threat from Zimbabwe’s new opposition party,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/zanu-pf-faces-threat-from-zimbabwes-new-opposition-party
