Russia has made many threats, but Sweden and Finland have still moved closer and closer to joining. Russia again tried to warn Finland against joining NATO as the northern European state moves ever closer to joining the alliance. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that Finland joining is ""definitely"" a threat to Russia, The Guardian reported. And Russia's foreign ministry said in a Thursday statement that ""Russia will be forced to take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, in order to stop the threats to its national security arising in this regard."" Russia's comments come after Finland's president and prime minister said in a joint statement on Thursday that they definitely want their country to join NATO, and want the application to be made as soon as possible. Sweden is also expected to apply for membership imminently. Rising public and political support for joining NATO in both countries has been prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia used the possibility that NATO could expand as a justification for invading Ukraine in the first place. Thursday's threats mirror those Russia has been making over the last few weeks, as Sweden and Finland move closer and closer to formally applying. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday that Finland would be welcomed quickly into the alliance. ""Should Finland decide to apply, they would be warmly welcomed into NATO, and the accession process would be smooth and swift,"" he said, according to the BBC.

5/12/2022,"(Note profane language in 17th paragraph) By Jonathan Landay VILKHIVKA, Ukraine (Reuters) - The near-constant crump of shellfire washed over this battered hamlet on Wednesday, testifying to fierce fighting beyond its wind-swept fields between Ukrainian troops pressing a counter-offensive and Russian forces that once occupied the area. While Ukrainian troops drove their foes from Vilkhivka in early April, the narrow lanes remain blighted by shrapnel, shell craters, and downed wires, and lined by houses pulverized into wood splinters and brick chunks. Three Russian portable rocket launchers lay at the intersection of Ukrainian and Moladzhna streets. Carcasses of rotting animals littered verges, yards and an agricultural enterprise and a damaged Ukrainian tank sat near the hulks of two Russian armored vehicles dragged into a makeshift checkpoint. The bloated corpse of a Russian soldier, mouth frozen in a deathly grimace, swollen chest bursting from a grey tunic, still lay moldering outside the fire-blacked shell of the local school that his unit had commandeered for a base. ""I grew up here and went to this school,"" said Andrii Korkin, 48, a contractor who came from the nearby city of Kharkiv to inspect his parents' home. ""I am a Russian speaker. Russian is my native language. I want nothing to do any more with the world of the Russian Federation."" As the lanky father of two spoke, distant bursts of artillery fire and fusillades of multiple rocket launchers echoed across fields that normally would be sown with corn and wheat. Vilkhivka lies less than 30 km (20 miles) south of the Russian border, close to which fighting rages between Ukrainian troops on a counter-offensive launched this month and Russian forces that failed to overrun Kharkiv when Moscow invaded on Feb. 24. The Ukrainian military reported new gains on Wednesday that signaled a possible shift in the course of the war, with troops advancing to within a few kilometers of the frontier, according to a Ukrainian military source. Moscow invaded in what the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise a neighbor that threatened Russia's security. Ukraine and its allies call that a lie, accusing Russia of an unprovoked aggresion that has killed thousands, uprooted millions and destroyed towns and cities. Villagers have only just begun filtering back to Vilkhivka to retrieve furniture and clothing from properties that escaped serious damage or to pick through the rubble of those that did not, salvaging what they can despite the risk from unexploded ordnance. Although Ukrainian soldiers bore the brunt of the fighting that drove the Russians out, Nikolay Riyanko, a grizzled 67-year-old pensioner, said he and other residents lent a hand. On the first night the invaders occupied Vilkhivka, he said, villagers stole a Russian diesel-filled tanker truck, and another loaded with ammunition. He filched a box of six rocket propelled grenades that he eventually gave to Ukrainian troops. “They burned Russian equipment and soldiers with those shells,” he said, recounting his tale before returning to shuttling belongings from his shell-torn home to an old car parked before a crater from a Russian missile. It remains lay close by. Before the fighting erupted, he said, Russian troops concealed themselves in homes. “They were hiding behind the locals,” said Riyanko. “They gathered about 30 people and kept us near one of their positions. There they had a machine gun, a tank, an infantry fighting vehicle.” “They kept us from 6 am to 5 pm so that the Ukrainian military would not shoot,” he continued. Eventually the Russians released the group, and the battle of Vilkhivka began. “Can they really be called real soldiers after that?” he spat. “They are motherfuckers, not military men!” “I sent my wife to the basement of my friend, but I did not have time to hide. We lived for eight days in the basements,” Riyanko recalled. “When the shell hit my house, the debris crushed my head. I got a concussion. I couldn’t hear anything for three days.” Civilian volunteers from Kharkiv eventually arrived to evacuate Riyanko, his wife and other villagers. “Today is the first time I have come back,” he said. “While I sort out the rubble and debris in my house, I'll stay with my neighbors for a while. Their house survived.” (Reporting by Jonathan Landay; Editing by Angus MacSwan)",World/Reuters,Sounds of Ukrainian counter-offensive echo in ruined village near Russia's border,https://news.yahoo.com/sounds-ukrainian-counter-offensive-echo-164149929.html
5/12/2022,"The US says Russia is putting chips from home electronics in tanks due to the effect of sanctions. Russia's military relies heavily on technology made by the US and allies, who have banned exports. The US commerce secretary said Wednesday that sanctions ""cripple"" Russia's ability to fix equipment. Russia is having to use computer chips intended for home appliances to repair its military hardware due to the impact of US sanctions, according to a US official. ""We have reports from Ukrainians that when they find Russian military equipment on the ground, it's filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators,"" commerce secretary Gina Raimondo told the Senate Committee on Appropriations on Wednesday. Raimondo recently met with Ukrainian officials who told her that they found parts from refrigerators and commercial and industrial machines when searching captured or abandoned Russian tanks, The Washington Post reported. Raimondo told the committee that exports of US technology to Russia have fallen by just under 70% as a result of sanctions, the first of which were imposed in late February. Russia's military hardware has long relied on technology made by the US or its allies, but US tech companies are now forbidden from exporting their products to Russia. ""Our approach was to deny Russia technology — technology that would cripple their ability to continue a military operation. And that is exactly what we are doing,"" Raimondo told the committee. The White House said Sunday that US sanctions are stymieing Russian attempts to repair equipment. ""Russia is struggling to replenish its military weapons and equipment. Russia's two major tank plants — Uralvagonzavod Corporation and Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant — have halted work due to lack of foreign components,"" it said. Ukrainian forces have shared abundant evidence that Russia is struggling to equip its forces adequately. Last month, Ukrainian troops paraded what they said was a Russian drone that had been covered in duct tape and fitted with a generic plastic bottle top for a fuel cap. In March, Ukrainian troops found what appeared to be Russian army bandages dating to 1978 discarded on a battlefield. Speaking on Monday, the UK's defense secretary, Ben Wallace, said that wrecked Russian fighter jets were being found by Ukraine with rudimentary GPS receivers ""taped to the dashboards"" because their inbuilt navigation systems are so bad.

5/12/2022,"(Adds context) May 12 (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday that Finland's announcement that it wanted to join NATO was a ""radical change"" in its foreign policy, and that Moscow would respond. ""Russia will be forced to take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, in order to stop threats to its national security arising,"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. Finland's president and prime minister had said earlier that their country must apply to join the U.S.-led Western military alliance ""without delay"", a major policy shift triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""Helsinki must be aware of the responsibility and consequences of such a move,"" Russia's foreign ministry said. Russia opposes the expansion of NATO, which it says is designed to constrain Russia. Prior to invading Ukraine in February, Moscow was demanding binding guarantees from the United States and NATO that the alliance would not admit new members.

5/12/2022,"The Japanese yen shows ""significant value"" as a hedge against a US recession, Goldman Sachs said. Goldman Sachs said part of its bullishness towards the yen is how cheap it is compared with other typical safe-havens. The bank said there's a strong chance of the Bank of Japan intervening to support the yen, given global market volatility. Goldman Sachs believes the Japanese yen is an ideal hedge against the risk of a US recession, which the investment bank believes is a possiblity in the coming two years. In a research note published on Tuesday, Goldman analysts, led by Karen Reichgott Fishman, noted that the yen is trading at ""extremely cheap levels"" and is undervalued aga ins the dollar to the tune of 20-25%. ""In other words, the yen is now trading at historically cheap levels and screens as the cheapest safe haven asset by far—at a time when global recession risk is on the rise,"" Fishman wrote. Fishman said the yen looked especially cheap compared with other traditional safe haven currencies such as the US dollar or the Swiss franc. The yen has been diving against the dollar and reached a 20-year low last week, partly because of the widening gap between US and Japanese interest rates, as the Bank of Japan has left monetary policy unchanged, while the Federal Reserve is in an aggressive tightening cycle to combat inflation running at 40-year highs. The BoJ meanwhile has pledged to cap the country's 10-year government bond yield at 0.25%, while 10-year Treasuries are yielding more than 3% right now, the biggest difference between the two since late 2018. Fishman said the situation has ""opened up significant value"" for the yen as a hedge against what the bank estimates is a 35% chance of a US recession within the next 24 months. ""Our latest work on FX hedges for key risk scenarios shows that the yen screens as the most effective hedge against a 'risk down, US rates down' shock—or a market backdrop consistent with recessionary pricing."" A rising dollar-yen however, is likely to call for intervention, Fishman noted, especially at a time when commodity prices, like energy, skyrocket as a result of foreign sanctions from Russia's war with Ukraine. ""Over the short-term, amidst highly volatile global markets, the yen will likely be influenced by changes in Treasury yields and commodity prices,"" she said. Given Japan's reliance on energy imports in particular, which are priced in dollars, the extreme weakness in the yen means there is a greater chance the central bank will step in to support the currency and avoid an even bigger increase in inflation. ""The combination of cheap valuation, non-trivial risk of intervention, and, most importantly, rising odds of recession to open up paths to dollar-yen downside,"" she said, referring to the potential for the yen to strengthen against the dollar. ""cheap valuation, non-trivial risk of intervention, and, most importantly, rising odds of recession"" will lead to a dollar-yen downside, meaning a greater opportunity to sell the dollar and buy the yen. ""Cheap valuation and rising odds of recession argue for a more constructive view on the Yen over the next year,"" Fishman said.

5/12/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China would prefer to take over neighboring Taiwan without military action but is working to get to a position where its military could prevail even if the United States intervenes, U.S. intelligence chiefs said on Tuesday. China views Taiwan, a democratically governed island, as its ""sacred"" territory and has never renounced the possible use of force to ensure eventual unification. The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its most important international supporter and arms supplier, making it a constant source of tension between Beijing and Washington. ""It's our view that they (the Chinese) are working hard to effectively put themselves into a position in which their military is capable of taking Taiwan over our intervention,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the Senate Armed Services Committee. Haines and Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testifying on worldwide threats to U.S. national security, discussed the lessons China may be taking from the war in Ukraine and the international response to it. Haines said she did not believe the war was likely to accelerate China's plans on Taiwan. Berrier said using the military to achieve its objective was not Beijing's top choice. ""I believe the PRC (People's Republic of China) would rather not do it by force. I think they would rather do this peacefully over time,"" Berrier said. China was learning ""some very interesting lessons"" from the Ukraine conflict including the importance of leadership and small unit tactics, as well as effective training with the right weapons systems and a strong non-commissioned officer force, Berrier said. U.S. officials needed to work with their partners in the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan's leadership, Berrier said, ""to help them understand what this conflict has been, about what lessons they can learn and where they should be focusing their dollars on defense and their training. ""They have a largely conscript force. I don't believe it is where it should be,"" Berrier said of Taiwan.
