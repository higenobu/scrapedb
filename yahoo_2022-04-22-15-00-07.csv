4/22/2022,"Source: Icon Sportswire / Getty A young basketball player and McDonald’s All-American is now hospitalized after being shot multiple times over the weekend in Nevada while at a house party in North Las Vegas. Aaliyah Gayles, 18, is a point guard at Spring Valley High School that’s committed to playing for the University of Southern California after she graduates. Gayles is one of four people — two of whom were minors — that was shot at around 11:15 p.m. after a fight occurred inside the residence, according to police. Sources claim the athlete’s head and torso weren’t targeted, the Las Vegas Review-Journal further detailed. “I know there is some that will say it’s my fault and I take full responsibility for it but please please keep my baby girl in your prayers Las Vegas,” Gayles’ father Dwight tweeted on Sunday night. “I will give everyone that support Aaliyah an update but she’s ok she go make it like always thank you all, true warrior.” I know there is some that will say it's my fault and I take full responsibility for it but please please keep my baby girl in your prayers Las Vegas.

A GoFundMe created to help Aaliyah and her family during the athlete’s “recovery and rehabilitation process” has raised over half of its $25,000 goal. The fundraiser’s description detailed that the 18-year-old arrived at the hospital’s trauma unit “with over 10 shots to her extremities,” and “has already undergone extensive surgeries.” “Aaliyah is one of the strongest, most resilient young people I have ever known,” USC women’s basketball head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said in a statement for PEOPLE. “I have no doubt she will continue to face this unfathomable situation with courage and resolve. We will continue to support her and her parents in every way that we possibly can.” Gayles’ status has improved and she’s expected to recover from her injuries, according to her father. We wish Gayles the best as she embarks on her journey of healing.

4/22/2022,"A prominent Russian TV presenter says Moscow's war in Ukraine will extend to Europe and the world. The Kremlin is already starting to wage a ""de facto"" war against NATO countries, he said. ""Ukrainians alone are no longer enough,"" Vladimir Solovyov said, in a clip posted by The Daily Beast's Julia Davis. A prominent Russian TV presenter said that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is approaching a ""new stage"" in which Moscow will find itself at war with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization — and by extension, the entire world. ""I believe the special military operation is entering a new stage. Ukrainians alone are no longer enough,"" said Vladimir Solovyov, according to the translation of a video clip tweeted on Thursday by The Daily Beast's Julia Davis. In the widely shared clip, Solovyov noted that NATO countries have been supplying weapons to Ukraine. ""We'll see not only NATO weapons being drawn into this, but also their operators,"" he warned while speaking on his show ""Evening with Vladimir Solovyov."" Solovyov, a prominent state media figure and supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has often repeated and amplified the Kremlin's pro-war rhetoric on the state-owned channel Russia-1. In the clip, he noted that Russia was ""starting to wage war against NATO countries."" We'll be grinding up NATO's war machine as well as citizens of NATO countries,"" Solovyov said. ""When this operation concludes, NATO will have to ask itself: 'Do we have what we need to defend ourselves? Do we have the people to defend ourselves?' ""And there will be no mercy. There will be no mercy,"" he added. Echoing Putin's call for the ""de-Nazification"" of Ukraine, Solovyov said: ""Not only will Ukraine have to be denazified, the war against Europe and the world is developing a more specific outline, which means we'll have to act differently, and to act much more harshly."" His comments come as several NATO member states announced they would provide Ukrainian troops with advanced weapons and heavy artillery and training on how to use the equipment. For instance, the US is now sending hundreds of tank-busting ""Switchblade"" drones designed to crash into targets and explode and dozens of long-range artillery systems called howitzers. The UK has also said it would provide 120 armored vehicles and anti-ship missile systems. Solovyov's recent statements on the war align with what some military analysts and Putin critics have predicted: That the Russian leader seeks control of regions beyond Ukraine, particularly Eastern Europe. ""We must understand that, in his head, Putin is at war not with Ukraine,"" exiled Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky told CNN on April 4. ""He's at war with the United States and NATO. He said this more than once.""
