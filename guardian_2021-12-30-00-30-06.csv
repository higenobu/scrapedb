12/30/2021,"It is safe to say that the current Ashes series will not be remembered as a classic of the genre. We follow sport for the contest, and the total lack of one is the reason there is so much consternation from wider English cricket quarters, even as the team tries to apply blinkers to get through two more Tests. There have been plenty of one-sided Ashes series, and most teams struggle away from home, but this has been another level.  When the tiny trophy has been played for in England in modern times, the contests have been closer. There is 2005, of course, the gold standard, but 2009 was also a 2-1 result that came down to the fifth match. The 3-0 scoreline in 2013 looks skewed, but Australia had two wins rained off on the last day, and came close to winning two other matches. The third and fourth Tests in 2015 were wipeouts for the visitors but they did still make the scoreline 3-2. And the 2019 series was a delightfully absurd carnival ride, with Steve Smith at Edgbaston, Ben Stokes at Headingley and Jofra Archer at Lord’s. Australia’s home wins in that period have not been remotely close, but have still had something to recommend them. The 2006/07 whitewash was a champion team roaring back after being stung by defeat. In 2013/14 the thrill of Mitchell Johnson’s lightning summer made another whitewash compelling viewing. Even in 2017/18 we saw Smith operating at the peak of his considerable powers. The current series has had no champion shaping it, just an English team that has failed to compete from the first ball. So in terms of what we’ll remember in years to come, foremost will have to be that final hour of the second day in Melbourne, when Australia had finished collecting a modest lead of 82 runs, then tore England open to the tune of four wickets for 31 runs by stumps. The Melbourne Cricket Ground is a strange beast. In its vastness, it can host 100 people at a Sheffield Shield match and feel like an abandoned city of the future. It can host 20,000 people for a football match and swallow the lot, still feeling empty. The stands are so high, the seats so far back, that during a quiet day of cricket it can sound like little more than a burble. Or it can come to life, stirring like Smaug on top of his gold, and breathe fire. The data analysts at CricViz track a measure of how dangerous certain bowling is, tracking lines and lengths and swing and seam and speed to calculate the average likelihood of that ball taking a wicket. According to them, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins jointly bowled the most threatening opening spell since records began. Cummins has a laconic walk to his mark, legs bowed and gait rolling like has just hitched his horse outside. When he turns, he glides in, the whip of his arm and the work of his wrist angling the ball in towards a right-hander before cutting it away from the bat. The movement isn’t much, but that is his comparative strength. Some bowlers spend their careers beating the edge. Cummins takes it. In contrast, Starc bounds in like a cartoon tiger. He is all limbs and leap, even before the delivery stride. Out of this run he slings the ball down from a low release. This can make his line a lottery, his left-arm angle taking the ball either well wide of off stump or down the leg side. In this series he has spent more time close to the off stump, just wide enough to leave but close enough that players keep being drawn into reaching for it. Ten overs, two wickets, and a thick current of adrenaline buzzing through the place. Starc coming within millimetres of a hat-trick, so nearly completing it against the world’s form player in Joe Root. The noise already wild. And then comes Scott Boland, the local player on debut, first forcing England to employ a nightwatchman, then blasting him out in two balls. A player being bowled is cricket’s most visceral spectator experience. From a distant vantage, a catch behind looks no different to the ball beating the edge. A dismissal leg before wicket looks the same as one not given. When crowds cheer those moments they are cheering an extrapolation of what has happened, not what they know themselves. But when the bails fly, they know. The visual explosion mirrors the raising of voices and hands. And there is the sound, that delicious clunk that can be heard in the most distant seat. That was the moment, the way every person in the ground lit up. Jack Leach left the ball, seeing its line, trying to do the right thing. Instead his choice left him standing still with his bat raised high, front foot forward, not interfering with anyone’s view, underlining just how comprehensively he had been done in. Batting for a final hour was always going to be tough, but the hour became series-sealing drama. We may not be replete with great moments in this series, but that one deserves to last.",Sport/Sport,Magical final hour with Starc and Cummins deserves defining memory of Ashes | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/29/magical-final-hour-with-starc-and-cummins-deserves-defining-memory-of-ashes-australia-cricket-england
12/30/2021,"Iwas born on a farm in northern South Africa. My parents moved nearer to Johannesburg when I was still a baby. They have a photograph of me at maybe six months old, asleep inside my dad’s guitar case. Just picturing it in my mind makes me feel safe. I can hear my dad playing. When I feel overwhelmed, I need something I can listen to on loop. Not just for hours, but for days, sometimes weeks. I think of these tracks as an aural hood. They hold my head together.  This year, I found Uwrongo by Ami Faku, the Afro-soul singer who came to prominence on the 2017 South African version of The Voice. Released in 2020, Uwrongo is actually a Prince Kaybee single, which Barack Obama included on his fabled annual playlist last Christmas and also featuring Black Motion and DJ Shimza. But for me, its staying power is all Faku, one of South Africa’s brightest lights. Uwrongo is a landscape in my mind. The opening beat that rattles like loose rings on the tines of a kalimba. The driving keyboard bassline, the syncopated drums. That splash and spray and sweep that good house DJs wield so well. The guitar that could only be South African. And Faku’s voice, this steady hand. Where you’re from, and what you are, are not always straightforward questions. As a shortcut to account for my own mixedness, I often tell people I’m half-French, half-South African. I feel more French than anything else, but we moved to France when I was 12, and for some people, I’ll probably always be a foreigner there. At the same time, being white and African, for me, means a constant unblinking reckoning with what colonialism and apartheid wrought. Those ills are in my bones just as South Africa’s many languages are in my ears. I learned (some) Afrikaans and isiZulu before I did French. Faku is Xhosa but, like most black (but far fewer white) South Africans, speaks several languages fluently. Before we speak, I want to make sure I understand what she’s singing about. I get in touch with an isiXhosa tutor I follow on Instagram who translates Uwrongo’s lyrics for me – they’re mostly in isiZulu, with some lines in isiXhosa. She gets to the few words I’d understood – uhamba and ekhaya, “go” and “home” – and laughs. “So this is a song about someone who is refusing to get broken up with,” she says. It strikes me as funny that I’ve spent 12 months of the pandemic obsessively listening to the line, “This is not working, go home”. But also, suddenly I am 14 again, in France, a teenager living in a language I’ve newly inhabited. Google tells me we’re exactly 11,884km (7,384 miles) away from “home” by way of the Trans-Sahara Highway. But we could be on the moon. I need music not to be something I have to parse for meaning (with my background and temperament, exegesis is force of habit) but something closer to night swimming. Something into which I can recede from words.“So now I know you’re singing about a breakup,” I say to Faku over Zoom. “Exactly,” she says, laughing. “You are jamming to a breakup song!” Even when listeners don’t understand her lyrics, they respond to the melody, which she qualifies as “very church”, and to the emotion. It’s because the writing comes from a true place, she says. Faku grew up singing in church. Her father, like mine, is a pastor. He and her mother have beautiful, low voices. Did that background shape her approach to music, to being quiet or being full of sound? “It took time for me to understand that there’s a connection there,” she says. She mixed in the other sounds she loved: hip-hop, R&B, Caiphus Semenya’s soft melodies, Brenda Fassie’s high energy. Faku doesn’t write with images in mind. Her process is all feeling. In the studio, she’ll hear melodies in beats that other people won’t detect. She once told an interviewer that she hoped to do an international collaboration singing in isiXhosa. “In South Africa, we have a unique sound,” she says. “I want a child listening to me to be proud of whatever culture they fit in.” Does Faku have a favourite sound? “I’m not technical about it,” she says, “but I am a minimalist.” This, too, she pegs to the pared-down nature of ecclesiastic song, sung in the round. “Do you sing a lot at home?” “Well, I never sang for my family,” she says. “I don’t know. I just didn’t think that …” She trails off. “Coming from Ezinyoka, which is a small township in Port Elizabeth, being an artist or a musician isn’t in our space. It’s not a reality for us. So I’m always low key. But when I’m alone, what I do more than anything is I listen more than I sing. I listen more. I listen more.” I listen back to this part of our interview several times. The repetition is beautiful.",Lifestyle/Life and style,The person who got me through 2021: Ami Faku sang the break-up track I listened to on a loop,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/29/the-person-who-got-me-through-2021-ami-faku-sang-the-break-up-track-i-listened-to-on-a-loop
12/30/2021,"It is clear that the public sector pay gap reported to government remains stubbornly high, at 15.5% versus 9% in the private sector. So where within public services is this happening, and why? In 2018, the first year of compulsory gender pay gap reporting, women working in the public sector earned 86p for every £1 their male counterparts did. In 2021, that dropped to 84p.  The vast majority – 88.7% – of 1,545 public sector organisations reported a median pay gap in favour of men, with 693 paying men at least 20% more than women. Of the 50 organisations with the widest gaps –private or public sector – 18 were multi-academy trusts, which run academy schools. The Learning for Life Partnership, which operates five primary schools in Cheshire East, reported a median pay gap of 77.2%, with women earning on average 23p for every £1 their male colleagues did, while the Pele Trust in Northumberland had a median gap of 72.5%. In all, 80 academies had gaps of 50% or more. The Learning for Life Partnership said the pay gap reflected its predominantly female workforce, not pay inequalities, and that staff were paid according to teaching and local authority pay scales. The health service had some of the biggest pay disparities in the public sector – and again the problem is getting worse. Queen Victoria hospital NHS foundation trust had a 32.1% gap while the clinical commissioning group (CCG) in Coventry and Rugby had the highest gap among CCGs, with a median gap of 35.8%. As a small specialist surgical hospital, Queen Victoria hospital said highly paid medical consultants formed a much higher proportion of its workforce than elsewhere in the NHS. When the figures were submitted, it had more than twice the number of male consultants than female. “This will change as more female consultants are appointed and our current female doctors progress their careers with us into more senior roles,” a spokesperson added. Despite making up three-quarters of NHS staff in England, 34 trusts and CCGs reported median pay gaps of 20% or more and 128 had gaps of 10% or more in favour of men. Only 40 NHS trusts had gaps of 5% or less in either direction. Christina McAnea, the general secretary of the public sector trade union Unison, said: “Bigger pay divides in parts of the NHS are often down to the large number of male highly paid consultants and senior medics on the staff. And senior women are more likely than their male colleagues to downsize their responsibilities and take on lower-paid roles as they approach retirement.” Among police forces, Leicestershire had the biggest gap of 31.6%; among local authorities, Tonbridge & Malling’s gap of 29.5% was the widest. A spokesperson for Tonbridge & Malling borough council said most of its management, including the chief executive, were women, but that “the contracting out of some services … saw many lower-paid men coming off the council payroll, which has made it harder to achieve balance at these levels”. Although 15 councils reported gaps of 20% or more, the overall picture in local government is improving, with the median gap now 3.6%, down from 5.8% in 2017-18. In the civil service, pay gaps have also narrowed, with the average median gap now 8.1%. But some departments have much higher rates, including the Treasury (16.8%), the Department for International Trade (15.9%) and the Ministry of Justice (15.6%). A government spokesperson said the national gender pay gap had fallen significantly, with 1.9 million more women in work than in 2010, and that ministers were due to publish proposals to “advance equality for women at work, increasing opportunity and tackling the issues that are holding women back”. But trade unions want the government to go further. McAnea said: “Reporting the figures shines a spotlight on what still needs to change. But only when employers are required to publish action plans for getting to gap zero will true pay equality be achieved.”",News/World news,Reminded of the gap: why men still get paid more in UK public sector,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/reminded-of-the-gap-why-men-still-get-paid-more-in-uk-public-sector
12/30/2021,"The gender pay gap reported to the government by Britain’s biggest firms is widening, Guardian analysis shows, prompting warnings that women face a bleak and worsening economic picture in 2022. Three years after a new law compelled companies to reveal the difference between male and female wages, data shows that eight out of 10 organisations with more than 250 staff still pay men more than women.  The most recent set of government data shows women are being paid a median hourly rate 10.2% less than their male colleagues, nearly a percentage point higher than the 9.3% gap reported in 2018. The pay gap in the private sector grew from 8% in 2018 to 9% in 2021, while in the public sector it grew from 14.4% to 15.5% Office for National Statistics data – considered to be the gold standard – shows that the full-time gender pay gap in April was 7.9%, down from 9.0% in April 2019, although statisticians say the pandemic could have caused variations. The gender pay gap for all workers, both full- and part-timers, was 15.4% in 2021. But the government data is considered another barometer of progress – or lack thereof – and a vital tool to push companies to take action to improve pay equality. There are growing fears that long-term economic gains made by women could go into reverse if ministers do not act. “The danger we face is not only a widening of the gender pay gap but a more general widening of wealth and income between men and women,” said Sara Reis, head of research and policy at the Women’s Budget Group. “There is a real risk that all the employment gains of the last decades are being put in jeopardy if women continue to be disproportionately impacted by this pandemic.” Reis said that in the next year women across different earning demographics could be hit, with low-paid workers in hospitality and other hard-hit sectors having hours reduced and jobs cut. Women who are able to work from home could see wages stagnate if they are again forced to homeschool children or miss out on opportunities through not being in the office. “There are likely to be different impacts for different groups of women, but they are all fairly bleak – and overall there is a real risk that progress will stagnate or go backwards,” said Reis. According to research from the group, it is too soon to see what impact the end of the furlough scheme will have on women’s employment. But the over-representation of women in industries with some higher Covid job losses, including retail and accommodation, and the fact that twice as many women as men are in the bottom 10% of earners, leaves them more vulnerable in a faltering economy, it states. Gender pay gap figures collected by the government are imperfect: the median hourly pay gap does not address the gap in similar job roles, the quality of the data is patchy and, due to exemptions, some high-level executives including partners and non-employed, typically low-paid workers, are not included in the data. A Government Equality Hub spokesperson said it would put forward new measures to improve equality for women at work in 2022. It added that the national gender pay gap had fallen by about a quarter in the last decade, with 1.9 million more women in work, which it said was a result “of this government enacting legislation for the right to flexible working, shared parental leave and pay – including a new online tool to check eligibility – and doubling free childcare for eligible working parents”. But an Institute for Fiscal Studies report this month found that “the vast majority of the modest convergence in earnings of the past 25 years” could be explained by the closing gap in education levels. Britain’s gender pay gap data-gathering exercise – which was ahead of the curve globally when it launched – risks falling behind other nations, said Jemima Olchawski, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society. Research from the charity found the UK was “unique in its light-touch approach” to asking employers what actions they would take, while other countries required smaller companies to report. Olchawski called on the government to address the cost of unpaid care work, make childcare more accessible and affordable, overhaul shared parental leave and “look at who is getting access to the most powerful and influential positions” to tackle power and wealth inequality between men and women. “This is a moment of risk and a moment of potential,” she said. “The big pieces of work are still to do, but are all achievable. If we don’t address these challenges we’re damaging our productivity and profitably with our economy at a time when we can ill afford it.” A spokesperson for the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which oversees enforcement of gender pay gap reporting, said measures to improve the gender pay gap – such as hiring more women at entry-level – could also increase the gap in the short term. “Clearly we want to see women on a level playing field with men across society, not only in the workplace, but the reason this is taking time is complex,” they said. “Gender pay gap reporting is about transparency, which then drives action. And the effects of that can take time.”",News/World news,"Gender pay gap at UK’s biggest firms is growing, data suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/gender-pay-gap-at-uks-biggest-firms-is-growing-data-suggests
12/30/2021,"For 11 days in May, Fatima Shbair hardly slept. When the most recent rounds of fighting in Gaza broke out between Israelis and Palestinians on 10 May, the 24-year-old freelance photographer said goodbye to her mother and left her home to document the stories of her neighbours in Gaza, as their lives were racked by terror. The conflict featured waves of pre-dawn Israeli air raids and rocket fire from Gazan territory. Palestinians made up the vast majority of more than 250 people killed.  It took a particularly heavy toll on children. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 66 Palestinian children died, as well as two on the Israeli side. Countless more were kept awake all night by explosions; others had to evacuate the buildings they lived in before they were bombed. During the day, Shbair photographed scenes of destruction and chaos. Then at night, she would stay up editing her photos and listening to the news on the radio, which dictated where she went the following day. Short naps and adrenaline kept her going. “At first my mother was calling me every day asking about me, how things were going,” says Shbair. “I asked her not to call me because I was afraid every time she did. I was afraid about [my family]. I didn’t want to hear bad news.” When Israel and Hamas announced a ceasefire on 21 May after 11 days of fighting, Shbair returned home but still ventured out to capture what was going on. On 24 May, she went to Beit Hanoun, a town on the north-east edge of the Gaza Strip. She knew entire neighbourhoods there had been destroyed, but that many residents had managed to get out in time. Shbair wanted to photograph people as they returned to their homes. “Every family was looking at what happened to their house with great sadness,” she remembers. Shbair came across a four-year-old girl, called Raghad, with her father. “She was so shy when I met her. Her dad helped me talk to her.” Together they went to visit the family’s house. “Raghad was walking with me, carrying her teddy bear. We moved from room to room in a house that only had rubble and broken walls.” They arrived in what used to be Raghad’s bedroom. “I asked her about the room she slept in,” she says. “She stood in complete silence as if she was remembering everything.” It was then that Shbair took the award-winning photo of the young girl standing amid rubble in a room with gaping holes in the wall, and looking out at other buildings in a similar state. “This picture sums up the feelings of everyone in the neighbourhood who lost their homes,” she says. Raghad and her family have since relocated to another area of Gaza and are renting a small house, says Shbair. “I went to see Raghad again. She looks like an angel. “She doesn’t speak much and her eyes are filled with sadness. She still remembers everything and misses her old house and friends from the neighbourhood.” Shbair, meanwhile, is on a break from studying journalism at Al-Azhar University in Gaza while she focuses on her photojournalism work. She taught herself photography, posting pictures on social media, where she gained an international following. In 2020, she began to receive assignments from international agencies, including Getty Images, to cover her home town. Shbair says she faces many challenges as a female photojournalist. The worst, she says, are societal views that dictate women who go to dangerous areas and take photos must be “bad”. “When you go to an event,” she says, “you find that everyone stares at you and starts making hurtful comments.” She does not let it affect her too much, though. “Everything around me deserves to be documented,” she says. “I feel a responsibility to make the voices of the people around me heard, and their images visible.” Her portfolio of photos from the 11-day conflict won her this year’s Anja Neidringhaus Courage in Photojournalism award. While the media spotlight has moved on from Gaza since May, Shbair remains and is determined to carry on sharing people’s stories of sadness and hope. “I want people to know about real life here. There is an everyday war. We have a blockade, electricity cuts, no water. “There are so many things people are suffering each day but they find a way to live,” she says. “They just continue.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,"‘She stood in silence, remembering’: photographing Gaza under airstrikes",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/29/photographing-gaza-under-airstrikes

12/30/2021,"The United States has punched through its record for daily coronavirus cases, as the Omicron variant has surpassed Delta in distribution across much of the country amid a massive surge. The seven-day average of US cases exceeded 267,000 on Tuesday, beating its January 2021 record of 251,232, according to a New York Times database. The fast moving Omicron variant now accounts for 59% of new infections, up from 23% a week earlier.  Hospitalizations, too, are rising, though not to the extent of previous surges. Around 71,000 people were being treated as of Monday, fewer than during the peak of the Delta variant, when more than 100,000 people were hospitalized. On Monday, New York had the highest number of people hospitalized with Covid-19 with 5,772 patients, followed by Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, California and Texas. Deaths, too, are increasing, with the daily average of 1,243, less than third of their January 2021 peak. The surge comes as the CDC controversially cut the number of days that infected Americans should remain isolated to five days from 10, and as health authorities report a disturbing rise in pediatric hospitalizations. The CDC said that after isolation, asymptomatic people should wear a mask around others for another five days. Rochelle Walensky, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the new recommendations to reduced the isolation period, “balance what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses”. However, unlike January 2021, an estimated 62% of Americans are now vaccinated and in many cases boosted. The CDC announced Tuesday that more than 1.5m shots had been administered in the previous 24 hours. However, Omicron’s surge has caused disruptions in US economy again. The variant has worsened a labor shortage, caused thousands of flight cancelations, and caused some businesses to once again shut their doors. More pressure, too, has been placed on the stressed US healthcare system. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has placed its emphasis on greater access to testing and in promoting booster shots to the vaccinated and convincing millions of unvaccinated Americans to accept the shot. The CDC reported that as of December 14, roughly 85% of adults ages 18 and over in the United States had received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine but 15% remained unvaccinated.

12/30/2021,"A gunman who killed five people and injured two others in a series of shootings in Denver is believed to have targeted the victims based on previous personal and business dealings and was investigated by police twice in the last two years. Denver police said that Lyndon James McLeod, 47, who was also killed in the deadly rampage on Monday night, knew most of the victims and was “on the radar of law enforcement”.  Matt Clark, the commander of Denver police’s major crimes division, said: “Based on what we know, it does appear that the offender was targeting specific people in this case. The victims were known to the offender.” He is not believed to have known the last person he shot, a hotel clerk, but police said she may have been targeted owing to a dispute with the hotel. Denver’s police chief, Paul Pazen, said McLeod had been investigated in 2020 and early 2021 but that charges had not been filed against him. These investigations “will be part of this ongoing investigation into this violent crime spree”, he said. He said it was too soon to identify a motive for the killings. The shootings, which started at about 5.30pm, took place across several locations in and around the Colorado capital. McLeod exchanged gunfire with police, injuring an officer, and was killed after he was shot by an officer in a busy shopping district in Lakewood, a Denver suburb. According to records from the Colorado secretary of state’s office, McLeod previously owned a business in Denver called Flat Black Ink Corp at an address that is now World Tattoo Studio. The first shooting was at a tattoo shop less than a mile from the address of his former business and four of the victims were shot at two tattoo shops in the Denver area. The first shootings were in central Denver on Broadway, a busy street with bars and restaurants, where he killed two women and injured a man, who, police said, is expected to survive. He then forced his way into a home, which is also a business, and chased its occupants through the building while shooting, but nobody was injured. A man was then shot and killed at a home near Cheesman Park, also in Denver. Police later chased a vehicle believed to be involved in the shootings and an officer exchanged gunfire with McLeod but he got away and went to Lakewood. Shortly before 6pm, Lakewood police received a report of shots fired at the Lucy 13 tattoo shop. Police said that a man, who they identified as Danny Schofield, 38, was killed there. After his car was spotted at the Belmar shopping area, McLeod opened fire at police and officers shot back, after which he ran away, allegedly threatened people in a restaurant, and went to the Hyatt House hotel, where he spoke briefly to a hotel clerk, who has been named as Sarah Steck, 28, and shot her. She was later pronounced dead. Approximately a minute later, a Lakewood police officer, who has not been named, saw him and ordered him to drop his weapon and he shot her in the abdomen. The officer, who is in hospital in a stable condition, then returned fire, shooting McLeod and killing him. A victim of the first shooting was identified by family members as Alicia Cardenas, 44, the owner of Sol Tribe tattoo shop. Alfredo Cardenas told KMGH-TV that she owned her first tattoo shop when she was 19 years old and had worked in the area for 15 to 20 years. “Very gregarious, very friendly, but she was a very determined person,” he said. “She knew where she was going.” He said that she is survived by a 12-year-old child. Her fiance, Daniel Clelland, speaking outside her shop where people have placed candles and flowers, said: “I don’t know why someone would do this.”",News/US news,Denver gunman who killed five in shooting rampage knew victims,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/29/denver-gunman-lyndon-james-mcleod-who-killed-five-in-shooting-rampage-knew-victims
