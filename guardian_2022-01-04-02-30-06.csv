1/4/2022,"One of the UK’s biggest care home operators is calling on the government to lift visiting restrictions after it recorded one Covid death in the last fortnight. Four Seasons Healthcare, which operates 165 care homes, said close to 4,000 residents were living under strict lockdowns because of outbreaks, but the Omicron variant was proving so mild in a well-vaccinated population that limits on seeing family and friends were in “total imbalance” with the risk.  Of 132 deaths among the chain’s residents in the last two weeks, just one was attributed to Covid, but because two or more staff or residents have tested positive in 86 homes, indoor visits are now largely banned. That is in step with government guidelines imposed before Christmas amid uncertainty about the danger of the latest coronavirus variant. “We are depriving people of their right to visitors, which is an absolute outrage,” said Jeremy Richardson, the chief executive of the UK’s third largest care home provider. “The government restrictions at the moment are making it very difficult to give people a quality of life.” He added: “We run care homes. We do not run prisons.” Residents and relatives have been left distraught by the further restrictions. Before Christmas the health secretary, Sajid Javid, announced that in England any care home in outbreak should shut its doors to indoor visitors for up to 28 days after the last positive case, except for people designated as essential care givers or if a resident is at the end of life. Movements out of the care home should also be minimised, Javid said. It has meant thousands of families have only been able to see loved ones through windows or in visiting pods. MHA, one of the largest not-for-profit providers, said on Monday that about of its care homes had had outbreaks that had restricted visiting. The Public Health Agency in Belfast reported that 120 care homes in Northern Ireland currently had outbreaks. The reports suggest care home outbreaks in England are likely to jump sharply, from 250 as of 19 December, in the next UK Health and Security Agency figures. But deaths from Covid in care homes in England, which accommodate 350,000 people, stood at 40 in the week to Christmas Eve, compared with a peak of about 1,800 in a week in January 2021. The latest NHS figures show 95% of care home residents in England have had two vaccine doses and 81% have been boosted. Jenny Morrison, a co-founder of Rights for Residents campaign group, said: “The impact of loneliness and isolation has far outweighed the impact of Covid in the later part of the pandemic, so are we going to continue with these strict visiting policies? It’s completely disproportionate to what we are facing.” Richardson said that since March 2021, 2,320 Four Seasons residents had died from all causes, and only 29 of them (1.25%) from Covid. Over that period the overall death rate has been below the four-year average prior to Covid. Nadra Ahmed, the executive chair of the National Care Association, which represents independent operators, said more than a quarter of her members were facing staffing shortages because of the requirement to isolate for seven days after a positive PCR test. One operator has reported half of its staff off with positive tests or off sick. “The other 50% of staff are exhausting themselves covering the shifts,” she said. Finding agency staff over Christmas was often impossible, and hourly rates had risen as high as £75, she said. Nicola Richards, the chair of the Sheffield Care Association, said PCR test results were taking six days for staff at some local homes, which was “causing huge issues”. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Our priority continues to be the safety of care home residents and staff. We are doing everything we can to support care providers to facilitate safe visits.”",News/Society,UK care home firm says visitor rules in ‘total imbalance’ to Covid risks,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/03/uk-care-home-firm-says-visitor-rules-in-total-imbalance-to-covid-risks
1/4/2022,"When Nadia Popovici spotted a small mole on the back of Brian Hamilton’s neck last October, during an NHL game between the Vancouver Canucks and the Seattle Kraken, she was unsure if the Canucks’ assistant equipment manager was aware it was there. Gaining Hamilton’s attention, she wrote a message on her phone and pressed it against the plexiglass dividing the crowd from the ice.  “The mole on the back of your neck is possibly cancerous,” the 22-year old fan wrote. “Please go see a doctor!” “Mole”, “cancer” and “doctor” were picked out in bright red letters. Popovici later told the Seattle Times that she had volunteered at hospitals, “surrounded with a lot of melanomas”. So when she saw the diameter, raised shape and “irregular border” of the mole on Hamilton’s neck, she knew she had to alert him. Hamilton looked at the message. He later said that he thought: “Well, that’s weird.” He rubbed the back of his neck and continued walking. But later that evening, he asked his partner if she could see the mole. When she said she could, Hamilton consulted a team doctor – who “didn’t like the looks of it either”. Hamilton had the mole removed and tested. It proved to be a type 2 malignant melanoma, a skin cancer that is curable if caught early. Within a week, Hamilton was cancer-free. On Saturday, Hamilton posted a call-out message on the Canucks Twitter page. “I am trying to find a very special person … [who] changed my life,” he wrote. “That evening, 23 October, and the message you showed me on your cellphone will forever be etched into my brain and has made a true life-changing difference for me and my family.” Hamilton added his thanks for the fan who went “to great lengths to get my attention from the stands while I did my job on the Canucks bench. We are looking for this incredible person and we need you to share this with your friends and families to help us find a real-life hero, so I can express my sincerest gratitude.” Within hours, Popovici was found. She had been asleep at home in Tacoma, Washington, after working overnight at a suicide crisis center in Seattle. As a Kraken season ticket-holder, she already planned to attend that night’s game between the Canucks and Kraken. Both teams invited her to meet Hamilton. “It was your effort and your persistence … the way you wrote it on your phone,” Hamilton said during an emotional meeting. “I owe it to this person to get checked, if she went this far. I don’t know her, I don’t know anything about her.” Popovici told Hamilton: “What an amazing way to start my journey to med school. It’s pretty priceless.” During a timeout in Saturday’s game, the Canucks and Kraken announced a $10,000 scholarship for Popovici, towards medical school tuition. Popovici, who sat in the same seat from which she spotted Hamilton’s mole, was overcome with emotion. The Canucks won 5-2. They later tweeted a picture of Hamilton and Popovici taking a selfie together. The caption: “The biggest win tonight.”",Sport/Sport,NHL fan saves life of Canucks staffer after spotting cancerous mole at game,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/03/canucks-kraken-brian-hamilton-cancerous-mole-nadia-popovici
1/4/2022,"Only free and fair elections in which the loser abides by the result stand between each of us and life at the mercy of a despotic regime – one we had no voice in choosing and one that can freely violate all our rights. So everything is at stake in the peaceful transfer of power from a government that has lost its people’s confidence to its victorious successor. It was that peaceful transfer that Trump and his minions sought to obstruct and almost succeeded in overthrowing when Joe Biden was elected president. A year has passed since Trump’s attempted coup and his supporters’ violent storming of the United States Capitol on 6 January 2021, in a nearly successful effort to prevent Congress from certifying Trump’s decisive loss of the election to Biden. Watching the images that day of the seat of US democracy overtaken and defiled, it was impossible not to viscerally feel the grave danger that confronted the republic. In the tumultuous year since, the immediacy of that sensation has waned – and the magnitude of the stakes has receded from memory.  In the rubble of the insurrection, the sheer shock of the moment jarred loose hints of long-lost bipartisanship and national unity and rekindled an appreciation of why a successful coup would have meant the end of all we care about. The House of Representatives expeditiously moved to impeach Trump for his role in fomenting the attack and 57 Senators, including seven Republicans, voted to convict him on 13 February after a masterful presentation led by Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland. After Trump had become the first American president to be impeached twice, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a blistering rebuke of Trump from the Senate floor, justifying his and many other Republicans’ votes to acquit only on the thin reed that, by the time of his Senate trial, Trump was no longer president. Alas, the moment was short-lived. With Trump himself out of office and in exile at Mar-a-Lago, public attention quickly faded, Republicans abandoned their increasingly half-hearted search for accountability, and the leaders of their party began planning their next bite at the poisoned apple of power, an apple they told themselves had been stolen from them despite all evidence to the contrary. Rewriting history and turning reality on its head, Republicans in Congress and their allies in rightwing media began absurdly to describe the deadly insurrection as a “mostly peaceful” protest, described rioters who brutally beat Capitol police as “political prisoners”, and suggested that any violence was attributable to some unidentified group of leftwing “antifa”. To be sure, we have seen the rise of a veritable cottage industry of commentary warning sharply that America remains subject to what some have called a “slow motion insurrection” or that “Trump’s Next Coup Has Already Begun.” Yet the vast majority of Americans have turned their attention back to other concerns – from new and more infectious variants of the Covid-19 virus, to burgeoning inflation and increasingly palpable signs of global warming, to the myriad other problems that bedevil our nation and the world. But for those of us who have continued to investigate the sources and facets of the assault on constitutional democracy, a sobering realization has become unavoidable: our country, and the legal and political institutions that prevent it from descending into despotism, are in even greater peril today than they were at the time of last November’s election. That assault began in the runup to the 2020 election, when Trump and his cultlike followers spread the corrosive view that American elections had become inherently untrustworthy as demographic changes broadened the eligible electorate and thus that any outcome other than victory for Trump would necessarily be the result of fraud and must therefore be rejected by all means necessary. With each passing day, more details about the means Trump’s team devised to undo the results of the November 2020 election have cascaded into public view, even though Republicans in Congress have made concerted efforts to obstruct the work of the special House committee created to uncover the sources of the attempted coup and the ensuing insurrection. The committee was charged to propose legislation to reduce the danger of a repeat performance, but because curing a disease requires diagnosing its cause, Republicans have seized on the committee’s search for causes to claim that its purposes were solely vindictive and not legislative. In the course of designing possible remedies, the committee has uncovered evidence of a conspiracy broader, more far-reaching and better organized than was initially thought. That conspiracy featured deceptive PowerPoint presentations and duplicitous talking points designed to propagate the big lie that Democrats had indeed stolen the election and to lay out a blueprint for “stopping the steal”. Understanding that blueprint requires appreciating the byzantine constitutional structure dating to our founding, a structure in which the presidency is awarded not to the winner of the national popular vote but to the candidate receiving the most “electoral votes”. Those votes are allocated among the states according to a formula slanted toward less densely populated states – states that have tended over time to favor the Republican candidate – with each state’s legislature determining the method for deciding how its electoral votes will be awarded. As Representative Raskin, a leading member of the special House committee, described it to me, the basic plan for Trump to seize power despite his loss of both the popular vote on 3 November and the electoral vote on 14 December had been to pressure various officials to “find” enough nonexistent votes to flip the results of several key states in which the election’s outcome had been the closest. Failing that, the plan was to pressure Vice-President Mike Pence, presiding over the 6 January joint session of Congress required under the constitution to count the certified electoral votes, to reject and return the slates of electoral votes certified by Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania, depriving both candidates of the requisite majority of the electoral votes cast. At that point, the choice of president would fall “immediately” to the US House of Representatives, with each state’s delegation casting a single vote in the resulting “contingent election”. That in turn would have made Trump the president-elect despite having lost the election, because more state delegations in the House were in Republican hands at that point than in the hands of the Democrats. Part of the plot, we are now learning, featured Trump’s invocation of the Insurrection Act to declare something like martial law to put down the chaos and bedlam he and his inner circle would by then have unleashed on the Capitol, all the time blaming Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi for not keeping order, a form of sinister gaslighting the Republicans have deployed ever since 6 January. Talk of that military option led the CIA Director to predict that “we are on the way to a right-wing coup”. But most terrifyingly, we have learned over the past year that the Republican party plans to do it again. Some retired generals are warning that, without decisive action to hold all the wrongdoers to account, we will witness a march to another coup attempt, and one more likely to succeed, if Trump or another demagogue runs and loses. Trump’s Republican party has all but erased or openly embraced the violence of 6 January. And the party faithful have already set out to use state-level elections and legislative processes to better set the table to steal the 2024 election should that be necessary to their return to power. And why wouldn’t they? Those involved in the last attempt have – at least as of today – faced few if any social, political or legal penalties. Only the foot-soldiers, those who physically invaded the Capitol, have faced criminal punishment. And even they have been charged with no offense more serious than corruptly obstructing an official proceeding. As I have elsewhere argued, it would seem more fitting to charge those who organized, funded, and otherwise led the nearly successful overthrow of our government with insurrection or sedition. Indeed, in the topsy-turvy world of Trumpian logic, the political base of the Republican party now appears by a large majority to believe that the real coup and insurrection took place not on 6 January 2021 but on 3 November and 14 December 2020, when Joe Biden and the Democrats supporting him were guilty of a “big steal” of the national election. Students of how democracies fail and tyrannical regimes arise from the dust they leave behind uniformly teach that such groundless myths of wrongful defeat at the hands either of enemies within or of enemies without are invariably part of the demagogue’s narrative and of its hold on popular consciousness. The specter of another coup attempt in 2024-25 may, at first blush, seem counterintuitive. After all, whether Donald Trump or another aspiring despot runs next time as the Republican party’s nominee, that candidate will have no access to the powers of the presidency when the national election occurs. But the corrupt actions that threaten soon to bring our constitutional republic to an ignoble end sadly do not require either an exercise of presidential power or the abdication of presidential duty. They require only that the cult of Trump repopulate with party hacks the bureaucracy of honest vote-counters and nonpartisan election personnel at the state and local levels, and that Trump-backed lawmakers elected to state legislatures rig the voting rules to dilute the influence of all who might oppose a Republican victory. Because these steps are well under way, we face a challenge more daunting than we did even when the powers of the presidency were in Trump’s hands. Nor can we count on the congressional voting integrity measures brilliantly designed with the help of Adam Schiff and Jamie Raskin, the Democratic representatives who led Trump’s two Senate impeachment trials, to save us from what the growing number of Republican state legislatures seem only too eager to do. For one thing, even before the 2022 midterm elections, Democrats control too few seats in the Senate to overcome the antiquated filibuster rules that make enactment of such voting rights measures with fewer than 60 votes an impossibility. For another, the US supreme court, as packed by means of dubious legitimacy by Trump during his presidency, is poised to hold unconstitutional virtually any meaningful voting protection or electoral reform Congress might enact even if that 60-vote obstacle could be carved away in a limited class of cases. Even if something should derail another Trump run at the presidency, the means for another coup exist, and the temptation to seize power, this time cementing it more permanently, will surely tantalize a political party that seems openly hostile to the very premises of democracy. Of particular concern to students of fascism – a governing form that almost always comes wrapped in violence – was the violence woven through the rise of Trumpism to the siege of the Capitol which was, of course, brutally violent. Participants came armed with body armor, firearms, knives, bear mace, Tasers and everything in between. They brought a gallows and chanted that they were going to hang the sitting vice-president. They brutally beat Capitol and DC police officers. Nor was the violence limited to that day. Leading up to the 2020 election, Trump supporters had run a Biden campaign bus off the road in Texas, plotted to kidnap the Democratic governor in Michigan and stirred up brutal attacks across the country. In the period after that election, they physically surrounded and intimidated senators on an airplane and in an airport, calling them “traitors” and promising consequences for their perceived defection from Trump. They showed up at state capitols armed to the teeth and threatening retribution if state legislators did not allocate their electoral votes to Trump, or at least pursue fraudulent “audits” of the election results. Far from being condemned, in the intervening year that sort of violence has been increasingly glorified by the mainstream conservative movement. In recent weeks, a congressman posted a Photoshopped video of himself murdering a Democratic colleague. A Fox News host discussed – to a crowd of radicalized anti-vaxxers – how they might most appropriately assassinate our nation’s chief epidemiologist with a “kill shot” in “an ambush”. Large crowds venerated a juvenile vigilante who shot three people on an American street. The base is being primed for more violence in the run-up and aftermath of the next election. And the Trump-packed supreme court is poised to do its part by gutting what is left of America’s laws against carrying guns anywhere and everywhere – including maybe in courthouses, polling places and the like. It is no accident that the 6 January hotel command center of the group led by Steve Bannon and Roger Stone was christened the “war room”. So what is to be done? We must resist state-level attempts to make voting more difficult. Instead, we must make vote-counting easier and use all legal means at our disposal to challenge publicly and in state and federal courts legislative district maps designed to dilute minority voters’ influence or to amplify the power of incumbency, as well as laws empowering state officeholders to designate presidential electors at odds with their state’s popular election results. We must use boycotts and grassroots political organizing to oppose the replacement of honest with corrupt election officials and the enactment of anti-democratic state laws. We must encourage the 6 January committee to complete its work thoroughly but quickly, including holding public hearings that spotlight the damning details of the plot that nearly succeeded, and making criminal referrals to the Department of Justice of all public officials – from members of Congress to the former president – suspected of such federal crimes as obstructing an official proceeding, aiding and abetting an insurrection or conspiring to commit sedition. We must fight back against suggestions that the justice department’s criminal investigations of the highest-ranking public officials should await any such criminal referrals from the committee. We must redouble our determination to hold criminally accountable, and potentially disqualify from ever again holding public office in the United States, everyone involved in the obscene trashing of constitutional democracy. We must publicly repudiate whatever misguided notions have led the Biden administration’s attorney general, Merrick Garland, to exercise extraordinary restraint in the pursuit of such full accountability, effectively placing the highest officeholders above the law. Above all, we must not let the difficulty of the task ahead turn realism into resignation and sap the energy we will need to bring to this mission. As the distinguished Yale historian Joannne Freeman recently wrote, “Accountability – the belief that political power holders are responsible for their actions and that blatant violations will be addressed – is the lifeblood of democracy. Without it, there can be no trust in government, and without trust, democratic governments have little power.” And when democracy loses its grip as a guiding ideal, despotism fills the void and liberty is lost. This is a battle we must not, cannot, will not lose.

1/4/2022,"The bookmaker William Hill could be fined after it emerged that it submitted incorrect data to the Gambling Commission. The information forced the regulator to tear up its analysis of the impact Covid-19 has had on betting habits.  Responding to concern that successive lockdowns could drive people to bet too much online, the Gambling Commission has published regular updates since March 2020 on how much customers of big firms such as William Hill are losing. But in an update published on 23 December, the regulator said it had discovered that William Hill provided “incorrect datapoints” for the 16 months between March 2020 and September 2021. As a result, the commission said it would have to re-analyse all its data and would not be able to publish correct information until February. The regulator’s statistical bulletins during Covid-19, which rely on submissions from firms with 80% of the UK market, are seen as a key resource for academics and health workers trying to assess how the pandemic affected gambling-related harm. The commission said it was now “reviewing any regulatory consequences of William Hill’s failure to submit accurate data”. The regulator’s powers allow it to suspend or revoke gambling operators’ licence, although in practice it does so only in extreme cases. However, it frequently reaches financial settlements with companies that transgress the terms of their licence to offer gambling services in Great Britain. The risk of a penalty comes as William Hill’s UK operation is in the process of a £2.2bn sale, after London-listed 888 Holdings bought it from the US casino operator Caesars Entertainment. William Hill’s data error means it is one of two major operators braced for the possibility of a financial penalty in early 2022, just as the government is putting the finishing touches to a review of how gambling is regulated, with proposals set to be announced in the spring. The Guardian revealed in November that the online casino SkyVegas, owned by Flutter, had sent “free spin” promotions to thousands of people trying to recover from gambling addiction.

1/4/2022,"School leaders in England are warning of weeks of disruption owing to high levels of staff Covid absences, which could lead to children being sent home to learn remotely. One secondary headteacher said he and 26 of his staff had tested positive for the virus, while others were having to stay at home to look after their own children as nurseries were closed, also because of Covid absences.  As the impact of the spread of Omicron over Christmas becomes apparent in Covid data, heads said it was inevitable that some classes and year groups would be sent home to learn remotely because schools would not have sufficient teachers or supply cover. A number of headteachers and one leading education union have expressed concern about new government advice to combine classes in the event of staff shortages, warning that it risks spreading Covid further and increasing disruption. In an email sent to schools on Sunday, the Department for Education (DfE) advised heads to deal with staff absence by teaching larger groups, but school leaders said this was not a workable long-term solution, with one warning it could lead to something “like a scene out of Mad Max”. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Schools and colleges desperately want to be able to maintain face-to-face teaching on a consistent basis, but the reality is that if large numbers of staff are absent this will cause disruption, which may include having to send home classes or year groups for short periods of time to learn remotely.” Meanwhile, heads are preparing for “difficult conversations” with some parents after the government called for masks to be worn in classrooms, while others are dealing with time-consuming subject access requests and freedom of information requests over vaccination programmes from anti-vaccination groups. Boris Johnson said on Monday he was not happy about calling for masks in classrooms but it was a necessary step. “There’s an increasing body of scientific support for the idea that face masks can contain transmission. I don’t like the idea of having face masks in [the] classroom any more than anybody else does, but we won’t keep them on a day more than is necessary,” he said. With the risk of widespread disruption to schools, Oak National Academy, the national online classroom set up by government when the pandemic first hit, is preparing for increased demand. “Schools and teachers are doing all they can to make sure pupils have a smooth return to the classroom after the holidays,” said Oak’s principal, Matt Hood. “For those children who cannot be in the classroom, Oak National Academy stands ready to support them.” Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said it was “alarming” that the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, was advocating combining classes of pupils to overcome staff shortages. “Collapsing classes will mix groups of pupils and risks providing the conditions for the virus to spread more rapidly, which will result in greater pupil and staff absence,” she said. Ben Davis is the headteacher of St Ambrose Barlow RC high school in Greater Manchester, which opens to pupils again on Thursday with a phased return to allow each year group to be tested for Covid. “I do feel a sense of trepidation,” he said. Masks have been reintroduced into classrooms in his school twice previously on the recommendation of Public Health England because of high infection rates, and Davis had to send a number of year groups home before Christmas owing to staff absence. As the spring term gets under way Davis fears there will be more of the same and is worried about the impact on summer exams. “My expectation is there will be quite a lot of disruption over the next few weeks and we will have year groups working from home.” Glyn Potts, the head of Blessed John Henry Newman RC College in Oldham, has himself tested positive for Covid and will not be in school at the start of term. A further 26 staff have also tested positive and he is waiting to find who will be out of isolation and available for work when pupils begin to return to school on Thursday. “What we are going to get on our return are absences of staff and children and a large number of challenging conversations with parents – those who are for or against masks and vaccinations – all of which distracts and takes time,” he said.",News/Education,Heads warn of weeks of Omicron disruption in English schools,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/03/heads-warn-of-weeks-of-omicron-disruption-in-english-schools
1/4/2022,"With fewer than 60 seconds remaining in regular time of Brisbane Roar’s clash with Melbourne Victory, Natalie Tathem – making her return from a 12-month ACL injury – drove down the right flank before delivering a low cross that Shea Conn­ors, just, reached first to bundle over the goal line. After being 2-0 down at half-time from an own-goal and a fortunate Lynn Williams effort, the Queenslanders were finally on the right side of a late comeback, with a 3-2 lead that soon turned into 4-2 after Norrie added a 96th-minute sealer.  In the aftermath of Conn­ors’s goal, however, as the rest of her teammates moved back into position for kick-off, the lone, diminutive figure of Katrina Gorry hobbled off: spent after putting in a player-of-the-match performance that had not only inspired the Roar to their first win of the season but reminded everyone that, for all the excitement surrounding a new generation of Matildas being brought through by Tony Gustavsson, a potential answer to the national team’s midfield predicament may lie in the re-establishment of the 2014 AFC women’s player of the year. Less than six months after giving birth and fewer than three after writing that she was unsure if she was going to be available for round one, Gorry has quickly re-emerged as one of the Roar’s most important figures during the nascent 2021-22 A-League Women season and, assuming she continues on her current trajectory, one of the best players in the competition. After coming off the bench in her side’s first two games and managing only 45 minutes in the round-three defeat to Victory, Gorry got through 90 minutes in each of the past two rounds. Funnily enough, those two fixtures were the first in which Roar picked up points this season. Despite her limited action and role in the midfield, she ranks eighth in the league for shots on target per 90 minutes among qualified players. On Sunday, the 29-year-old proved integral to Roar’s attempts to advance the ball up the field, served as an important – and stabilising – touchstone for her side in possession, and delivered an equalising goal which not only demonstrated what she is capable of producing with the ball at her feet but also how she’s able to operate without the ball to make all that possible. Gifted extra space to operate in the midfield thanks to Kyra Cooney-Cross’s red card, she slid into a position to the right of Mindy Barbieri to show for a pass from Mariel Hecher, adjusting her alignment so she could receive a ball to feet – itself a rare request in tight areas in Australian football. Her Brazilian teammate found her, and she attacked the space afforded by a retreating Victory back four. Before Emma Robers had a chance to scramble across she let loose with a chipped effort that sailed perfectly over the head of Victory goalkeeper Melissa Maizels. She was mobbed by teammates, but not before a rock-the-baby celebration in the direction of daughter Harper in the AAMI Park stands – a dedication of her first goal since becoming a mother to her new baby. That Gorry’s star turn came in direct competition with Matildas breakout player Cooney-Cross was fitting. Though both arguably perform better further up the field, the pair’s best path to national team minutes under Gustavsson heading into 2023 likely means competing for a deep-lying midfield role. And while Gorry’s performance wasn’t perfect – a lazy turnover in the 30th minute indicative of both some level of rust and a lingering preference to play the ball to a familiar teammate and fellow Matilda Larissa Crummer – she won the battle between the two on Sunday. Both bring their own strengths and weaknesses but, as Gorry has already begun to hint at in her return this season, she holds a rare skill set; a coolness under pressure and the ability to make good decisions rapidly. Such attributes set her apart from her contemporaries and make her considerably more press-resistant than most of Australia’s options in the midfield. When taking into account the Matildas’ issues playing against defences with the ability to prevent transition and force them to break down a low block, her ability to advance play by passing forwards rather than side to side, dribbling between the lines, or simply by taking positions that force a defensive reaction – and, by extension, open up space for others – shapes as a potentially crucial weapon for when the world descends on Australia and New Zealand for the 2023 World Cup. Is it a case of one or the other? Absolutely not. At just 19, Cooney-Cross represents the future of the Matildas and, as she matures and gains more exposure to top-flight football – potentially in a major European league – she can only improve on an already-impressive base. But in an environment of considerable hype over Cooney-Cross, Mary Fowler, Clare Wheeler, and more, do not forget about Gorry. This month’s Asian Cup may prove a bridge too far, but 2023 – a goal she herself has set – looms large.",Sport/Football,The Matildas should not forget about Katrina Gorry ahead of 2023 World Cup | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/the-matildas-should-not-forget-about-katrina-gorry-ahead-of-2023-world-cup
1/4/2022,"Getting caught in the rain is depicted on screen with near-comic frequency. From make-out scenes in Nicholas Sparks film to the drama of Shawshank Redemption and Point Break, stormy skies have long been a marker of heightened emotions, desperate declarations and a willingness to well, get wet. With La Niña weather patterns already making this a particularly wet Australian summer, on the upside, we can plan grand romantic gestures with a little more oomph. But this doesn’t mean our clothes have to suffer. Here’s how to care for your outfit after that dramatic downpour pash.  When you get home after being caught in the rain, assess what you’re wearing and how drenched it is to determine what to do next. Corey Simpson, a communications manager for clothing company Patagonia, says: “Some material may not need any care after being caught in the rain; others, like natural fabrics, may need to be dried.” Garments like coats and jackets that have natural water resistance can just be shaken out or wiped off, while t-shirts, jumpers and pants that have absorbed rainwater will require more attention. Once you’ve taken wet clothes off, it’s best not to leave them sitting in a pile or inside a clothes basket, as this can result in mildew and smells. Damp clothes should be hung on a rack to dry or washed straight away. If you’ve been particularly adventurous (or unlucky) and your clothes are dirty as well as wet, Simpson says to “wipe off chunks of mud and debris” first, “then wash the garment according to the manufacturer’s instructions”. For delicate fabrics like fine wool and silk, a trip to the dry cleaner may be in order to prevent water stains. Simpson says synthetic fabrics coated “with a durable water repellent usually fare best in the rain” but they also require special treatment to maintain their performance. Unfortunately, water repellence doesn’t last forever. It can be affected by dirt, your skin’s natural oils, sunscreen and smoke, so it’s important to keep your raincoat or puffer jacket clean. Simpson says: “Be sure to wash and dry your garment often – this helps remove oils and anything that can hinder the performance of your puffer or raincoat.” Check the care instructions, but most nylon or polyester rain jackets and waterproof shells are machine washable. Use a performance wear-specific cleaner (Simpson recommends Grangers). Proper drying is also important to maintain water-repellent properties. Raincoats should be run through the dryer on medium heat for at least half an hour, he suggests. If care instructions permit, ironing can also improve water-repellent properties, but this should be done over a towel on a very low heat to avoid melting your jacket. For less technical rain garments – like waxed cotton parkas or poly-cotton trench coats – it is best to follow the care instructions on the label. Ironically, some rain-repellent trench coats can be dry clean only. Puffer jackets should be washed with a down-specific detergent, and can take a long time to dry. They should be left to drip dry for between 24 to 48 hours, while being given the occasional fluff to prevent the down from clumping. When almost dry, put the puffer in the dryer on a low heat with some dryer balls to completely break up any remaining clumps. If the water-repellent properties of your outerwear have diminished after a few years of wear, the good news is you can apply a fresh layer. Patagonia recommends the wash-in or spray-on products from Nikwax – which also work on waxed cotton. Getting caught in the rain is the number one reason to waterproof your shoes and sneakers when you first buy them. Jenny Velakoulis, the owner of Evans Leather Repair, says to apply three coats of a waterproofing spray to your leather shoes, then reapply every six months. The same goes for sneakers. Eugene Cheng, the founder of Sneaker Laundry, a maintenance service in Melbourne, says the first and most important step is protection. A waterproofing spray will form a barrier around the sneaker, making it easier to care for. If the rain has already got to your shoes, before drying them out, make sure they’re clean. Use a material-specific shampoo to prevent dirt from drying into the shoe, then place leather shoes somewhere dry, away from heaters and out of direct sunlight to dry off. Once dry, apply a balm to nourish the leather. For sneakers that have been soaked, take out the laces and insoles and leave them outside in the sun. Cheng warns that sneakers can get mouldy if they’re put in closets or left indoors while wet.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Home and dry: what to do with clothes that have been caught in the rain,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/home-and-dry-what-to-do-with-clothes-that-have-been-caught-in-the-rain
1/4/2022,"“Every disruption is a point of potential growth,” says associate professor Terry Bowles of the University of Melbourne. And we have experienced quite a period of disruption. Unprecedented change overwhelmed us in 2020 and 2021. Enduring the Covid pandemic has meant living through drastic adjustments to social and professional environments, an intense restriction of movement and choice, and prolonged bouts of social distancing and isolation.  “What this disruption does is pressure us to make decisions we otherwise wouldn’t make,” Bowles says. Covid has “literally made us step up” to make changes in our lives that are “quite radical”. “Covid, for a lot of people, will be a new opportunity.” Guardian Australia asked readers to share how the pandemic made them rethink their life. Alongside more than 100 reader responses, leading experts on mental health and wellbeing say Covid has transformed people’s sense of self, and the way wellbeing, priorities and identity are being though about. Experiencing major change that makes us reassess our sense of self is “part of normal life”, says Dr Amy Dawel, a clinical psychologist and senior lecturer at the Australian National University’s College of Health and Medicine. “From divorce to a major move, having children or starting a new job – they are usually personal disruptions that make you reassess parts of your life and identity,” Dawel says. What is unusual about the disruption of the past two years, she says, is that it has been “forced upon us” on a mass scale. “There is less autonomy, and a much greater sense of uncertainty.” At first, Australians felt “distant” from and “unaffected” by the Covid pandemic, Bowles says. “Unfortunately, that slowly changed” Now, almost two years on, a widespread social disruption caused by Covid still permeates with “elements of distress at a universal level”. Skewing lives socially, professionally and financially, adapting with Covid “grinds people down to fatigue and distress”, Bowles says. “And it has prompted changes that have altered entire identities.” Such involuntary change and loss of control has a “massive impact” on wellbeing, says Prof Nicolas Cherbuin, head of the Australian National University’s Centre for Research on Ageing, Health and Wellbeing. “When a person has a sense they can control their lives, they tend to flourish more. And what we experienced with Covid was a generalised loss of control. “We were told to go home, to change the way you socialise, change the way you work.” Simultaneously, “the way a person defines themselves” with markers of identity – such as roles in a family, workplace or community group – were upended. Some academics have observed this as “social role disruption”, alongside the more general disruption in society. “This all has a major impact on our agency, and who we think we are,” Cherbuin says. Suddenly, one’s perception of self is very different, Dawel says. “Changing dramatically the context we are living in changes the way we fit in it.” Bowles says that while some adjust quickly, others will need “serious support”. However, amid the disruption has come the potential for personal development. In an attempt to regain agency, Bowles says, “people have been adapting”, albeit at varying rates. A discontent during Covid times has encouraged people to “reflect on what they want out of life, study, retirement”, Bowles says. “People will ask themselves a lot of questions about values. We will ask ourselves why we do things.” Cherbuin calls it a mass redirection of priorities. Many responses from Guardian Australia readers reflected Cherbuin’s observation that people are quitting jobs and reassessing work, “because they realise their work habits are unsustainable”. Various other themes emerged as well. Popularly, realisations about relationships. Some readers wrote of new appreciation for social connections. “I don’t need a lot of stuff to be happy, but I do need connection to people,” one said. Others wrote of “reassessing” whether certain relationships are “worth it”. Many shared the experience of ending a long-term relationship or marriage in the midst of Covid. For one reader, following the end of their marriage, “lockdowns actually gave me pace to process this, reclaim my home and heal”. Cherbuin says that, similarly, lifestyles have been reassessed and “people have taken up new activities”. Many respondents wrote of learning to bake, growing a vegetable garden, starting yoga and and getting into running. For many, during the last years of disruption, personal health became a bigger focus. Studies by the Alcohol and Drug Foundation, for instance, suggest 23% of Australians started to exercise more and 25% fit in more hours sleep. As well, 13.9% of people said they increased alcohol consumption during lockdowns in 2020, while slightly more (14.7%) said they were drinking less. Readers reflected this mix but shared healthier habits, such as reducing alcohol consumption or stopping smoking during Covid, with one respondent writing: “I no longer want to go to events where drinking alcohol is the main activity.” The rethinking of priorities, and the logistical opportunity for white-collar workers in particular to not need to live near their workplaces, prompted the biggest migration from cities to the regions in Australia’s history. Considering relocation, particularly to areas outside the boundaries of a city, was another lifestyle change considered by some readers for whom cities had begun to lose appeal. “I would like to leave Melbourne and live in a more rural environment,” one respondent wrote. “I moved to Melbourne for the music scene and arts culture but now it’s not as important to me as it was before the pandemic.” With lockdowns, disconnection from friends and loved ones and generalised anxiety during the pandemic, psychological distress increased overall. So too did attention to one’s own mental health, and that of others around us. Mental health and wellbeing has emerged as an important priority for readers, with multiple respondents sharing that, during the pandemic, they reached out to mental health professionals for the first time. While self-harm among teenagers increased, the feared increase in suicides in society as a whole did not come to pass as individuals were encouraged to take care of their mental health by everyone from the prime minister to kindergarten classroom teachers. “Covid has given people a reason to say: it is OK to feel not OK,” Dawel says. “It has legitimised seeking help for mental health reasons.” Cherbuin echoes this: “Now, more people are going to see mental health as not just a distant problem some people have. What Covid has done is prompt this broader realisation of what mental health and wellbeing means to anyone and everyone, including myself.” “I think it is one of the really positive things to come out of Covid,” Dawel says. Across every facet of people’s lives, both major and minor changes have been assessed and adopted. Underlying them are important shifts in mindset. One reader, who left her job, ended a long-term relationship, adopted animals and plans to start a company in 2022, writes: “I changed nearly everything.” For Brian Mulquiney, 70, from Queensland’s Gold Coast,“the pandemic created the catalyst to reassess what is important in life”. Bowles says it comes down to a simple explanation: “We have all become closer to death. Out of Covid, the next most obvious thing to think is: what to do with what we have left of a finite life?” While Bowles says Covid has given some people a “platform from which you’d leap when you otherwise wouldn’t”, others will just be “breaking even” and “trying to sustain themselves”. Universally, however, he says Covid has “supercharged” disruptive experiences. “We all went through the changes. Everyone can identify with it.” In the past, world wars have prompted structural changes, such as introducing women to the workforce. Dawel says she is interested to see what sticks post-pandemic, particularly when it comes to people “figuring out who they are, and their perception of how the world works”. Cherbuin thinks it is less likely people will “click back into old ways”. “I think there will be positive health and social consequences in the long term.” From structural changes in the workplace to personal changes to lifestyle and habits, “all these changes have been demonstrated to be possible”, Cherbuin says. “It means that now things that couldn’t be done before can be done.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘What do we do with our finite life?’: how Covid reframed our relationship with ourselves,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/what-do-we-do-with-our-finite-life-how-covid-reframed-our-relationship-with-ourselves
1/4/2022,"Back pain is the most common form of chronic pain, with about 4 million people living with it in Australia. The most effective way to manage chronic back pain is with a multidisciplinary approach, of which exercise is a key component. “Any single treatment in low back pain is never enough by itself,” says Associate Prof Michael Vagg, a pain medicine physician and dean of the faculty of pain medicine at the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists. “But exercise is a fundamental part of recovering from low back pain and managing it if it becomes persistent.”  But people who have suffered from back pain for a long time might feel fearful of moving. Dr Matthew Bagg, a physiotherapist and pain scientist at Curtin University, says the first big challenge for people with chronic back pain is understanding that pain is not an accurate indication of the robustness of their body. “Regardless of how they feel, they are not broken, damaged or falling apart.” “If it hurts to do something, people are likely to do less of it,” Vagg says. But those who remain active tend to have better outcomes in the long term. “Even when we experience back pain, it doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be moving.” “Pain itself isn’t an issue,” agrees Dr Rob Laird, a musculoskeletal physiotherapist. But increasing pain during and after exercise is a red flag, he says. “Exercise should reduce, not increase, pain.” There is limited evidence to suggest that one type of exercise is better than another when it comes to chronic back pain. “The best exercise is one that you will keep doing and enjoy,” Vagg says. Laird says physical activity for chronic back pain should include three domains: strength, mobility, and cardiovascular fitness. Consulting a GP or a physiotherapist before starting an exercise routine for chronic back pain is strongly recommended. But here are some practical tips that can help you stay active. In a study published in October in the Journal of Physiotherapy, Bagg and his colleagues conducted a statistical analysis that combined the results of multiple clinical trials of exercise therapies for people with long-term back pain. They found some evidence suggesting that pilates exercise might have the most significant effects on pain intensity. Pilates classes include a series of exercises that focus on the stability and mobility of the body, particularly the spine, core and pelvic area. It emphasises the “neutral spine position” – the natural curves in our spine that provide stability and mobility for taking on the weight and pressure of our bodies. Pilates exercises also help strengthen legs and gluteal muscles, shoulders and arms. Laird advises strengthening lower limb and gluteal muscles because these are the muscles we use when we bend or move from sitting to standing. “If they are underdone, the back muscles have to work harder.” Because exercising legs and glutes does not involve excessively recruiting back muscles, he says, most people feel safe doing it. Laird suggests beginning with the classic pilates roll down and progressing to single knee squats. To start a roll down, imagine standing against a wall, then think of peeling your spine off the wall one vertebra at a time, beginning by tucking the chin in, rolling the neck and slowly going down to the pelvis. Your knees are slightly bent, and you might feel some pressure in your hamstrings. To come back up, roll the pelvis first, then the spine, one vertebra at a time. Neck and head come up last. The second part of the exercise targets the gluteus maximus. Roll down again one vertebra at a time, place one hand on a chair to balance and lift one foot off the ground. Bend the knee of the standing leg, then push through the heel and come back up. Aim to five to 10 repetitions and change side. Reduced mobility of the spine has a poor impact on back function, Laird says. A simple exercise that can help improve back mobility is the cat-cow stretch. Start in a four-point kneeling position with your hands under your shoulders and knees under your hips. Breathing in, allow your stomach to drop down slowly and tilt your pelvis forward. As you exhale, arch your back up by tucking your tailbone in and pulling your belly button in towards your spine. Laird says brisk walks, cycling or swimming are great ways to include cardiovascular fitness in your training. These are all activities most people with chronic back pain can do, he says. “Cardiovascular fitness is essential. If you are not fit enough to walk around the block easily, you are going to struggle with life in general, and pain is still going to be a real problem.” Laird does not encourage taking up running. “Running is not recommended at the start of a recovery plan but can be used in younger patients towards the middle to end of their recovery plan,” he says. “It’s less useful in older patients – over 60 approximately, although there are always some exceptions – because of the impact loading when there is significant degenerative change already present.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,How to move: with chronic back pain,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/how-to-move-with-chronic-back-pain
1/4/2022,"It’s 4 July 1987: the Go-Betweens are playing the Roskilde festival in Denmark – one of the largest festivals in Europe; the one you want to play. As a B-grade cult band, we are excited. We’ve been on the road for eons, on an endless European tour for our fifth album Tallulah, before veering to the US and Australia. We’re booked to play at 6pm on one of the smaller stages. I wander around the backstage village and share a cookie with another band member. I had bought the cookie from an ingratiating post-punk hippie. My musician mate disappears. I lean against a tent post. Usually I see many variables, yet I’m fixed. I wonder who might rescue me as time stands still. Crew, musicians and caterers walk past me in slomo. Eventually the ritual of making it to the stage takes over. I find my way to our lot which looks like the dining room of a train carriage. I flop beside three band members.  Bob Johnson, our long-serving manager, berates me for looking like a grub. “Look at your T-shirt, it’s covered in stains.” I look down at my mucky white tee and I am Eliza Doolittle picked from the street. The gig is exhilarating. We play with our usual love to a crowd that stretches for ever and who gets us. And after, Chrissie Hynde from the Pretenders walks on to the stage and kisses it because Bob Dylan once stood there. I avoid Geoff Travis from Rough Trade Records – I don’t care that he dropped us for the Smiths; I’m incapable of the cleverness he expects from me. We hang out backstage with the Woodentops and Voice of the Beehive. Fellow Australian band Hoodoo Gurus are on the bill and drive us back to the hotel in Copenhagen. Many musicians are milling in the large, ultramodern foyer of glass, tiles and bulky pot plants. A large staircase descends from the floors above, giving the room a sense of grandeur. Then a commotion. The Hoodoo Gurus’ crew are stuck in the elevator on the first floor. I rush up the stairs, peering in. The Gurus’ tour manager is a large man and he’s struggling. I’m talking him through it when another crew member arrives and we stand, peering in, together. “I want one thing,” says the tour manager trapped in the lift. “Just get her away from me now.” I thought my counselling skills were good but they are not on this day; somehow, they elude me this day. Back in the foyer, Clyde Bramley, bass player with the Gurus, demands that something be done. Where is that firetruck that was called 20 minutes ago? Clyde is maddened. The crew in the lift are disturbed. The foyer is a mass of competing energies – the staff calming, the musicians agitating. Clyde is done. He picks up an enormous pot plant and smashes it to the ground. “Get them some help,” he bawls. With minutes, hurtling down the stairwell, is Michael McMartin, the Gurus’ manager, catching Clyde in a headlock, holding him tight to his chest on the stairs till he calms. Robert Vickers, the Go-Betweens’ bass player, whispers to me: “I know what that feels like?” I ask: “What do you mean?” He replies, face as dead as a dead pan: “The pressure of touring. Late nights, early mornings, hurry up and wait, always trying to do your best, I know how Clyde feels.”",Arts/Music,"The Go-Betweens’ Lindy Morrison: I’ll never forget playing Roskilde, when chaos hit the Hoodoo Gurus",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/04/the-go-betweens-lindy-morrison-ill-never-forget-playing-roskilde-when-chaos-hit-the-hoodoo-gurus
1/4/2022,"While 5 million Australians go hungry each year, an estimated 7.3m tonnes of food is wasted. In Australia, up to 25% of all vegetables produced never leave the farm, often because they are too oddly shaped for the grocery store. All the while, these reject fruits and vegetables – also known as “imperfect produce” – remain perfectly good to eat.  Though the numbers sound overwhelming, a solution may emerge from the world of small-scale startup subscriptions. Subscription shopping exists not just for the makeup-lovers and book-fanatics. Buying a subscription box of imperfect groceries may just be the most convenient way to simultaneously offload your weekly shop for fresh produce and reduce waste. Good & Fugly, a produce subscription service based in greater Sydney, delivers boxes of fresh produce direct from the farm. Each box includes staple ingredients – such as potatoes, onions and leafy greens – as well as a variety of changing seasonal produce. A small box of fruit and veg, feeding two people for up to five days, sells for $39. A larger box, feeding five people for up to five days, sells for $59. Farmer’s Pick, a Melbourne-based service, has found a home for more than 100 tonnes of fresh, oddly bent and sometimes blemished produce. Straight from local farms, the produce varies week-to-week, and subscription options cater to single and family households, with boxes starting at $35. The service also partners with Alex Makes Meals, donating up to seven meals to Victorians facing food insecurity for every box sold. Harris Farm, the family-owned NSW market chain, offers their own imperfect produce service at a discount of up to 50% off on fresh produce through their Imperfect Picks range online. Or, if you want a curated box to save you the trouble of adding to your cart, buy their Imperfect Picks Value Box for $40. Give the strangely-bent carrot or bumpy potato a try and you’ll support local farmers, reduce your contribution to a growing volume of wasted food each year, and you may just find you consume more fresh produce than ever.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Easy wins: imperfect produce – the perfect solution to food waste,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/easy-wins-imperfect-produce-the-perfect-solution-to-food-waste
1/4/2022,"Human bodies have a second line of defence against Covid that offers hope in the global fight against the Omicron variant, Australian researchers say. University of Melbourne research, done in conjunction with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, has found T-cells should be able to tackle the virus.  Omicron has a higher number of mutations than other variants, which means it can sometimes slip past the antibodies produced by vaccination or infection. But if it does enter the body, the T-cells – white blood cells that originate in the marrow – will attack.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The research has just been published in the peer-reviewed journal Viruses. Co-leader of the research, the University of Melbourne’s Matthew McKay, said while it was a preliminary study, it was “positive news”. “Even if Omicron, or some other variant for that matter, can potentially escape antibodies, a robust T-cell response can still be expected to offer protection and help to prevent significant illness,” he said. “These results overall would suggest that broad escape from T-cells is very unlikely. “Based on our data, we anticipate that T-cell responses elicited by vaccines and boosters, for example, will continue to help protect against Omicron, as observed for other variants. We believe this presents some positive news in the global fight against Omicron.” The team studied fragments of Covid’s viral proteins – called epitopes – from patients that had been vaccinated or infected. Among the epitopes that had the Omicron mutation, more than half were predicted to still be visible to T-cells, HKUST research assistant professor and study co-lead Ahmed Abdul Quadeer said. “This further diminishes the chance that Omicron may escape T-cells’ defences,” he said. The paper’s authors warn that T-cell responses alone do not block infection and therefore prevent transmission. However, the T-cell immunity provides hope of a protection against severe disease. Dr Stuart Turville, from the University of New South Wales’ Kirby Institute, has been studying samples from people infected with Omicron. He said T-cells represent a “pretty good backup” in the immune response. That response is multi-factorial, he said, as both T-cells and B-cells (which produce antibodies) develop a “memory” of the virus that attacks the body. “At the beginning, what gives them that memory is the primary encounter,” Turville said. “If you’re lucky, it’s a vaccination; if you’re unlucky, it’s the first time you’re infected.” University of Sydney’s Prof Robert Booy, who is also a director of the Immunisation Coalition, said T-cells were an “important backup” to antibodies because they recognise different parts of viruses to produce a response to entire cells, not just their proteins. Australia has a long history of T-cell research, he said. Prof Peter Doherty – the patron of the Peter Doherty Institute, which has been providing Covid modelling – won the Nobel prize in 1996 for his work on T-cell-mediated immunity. Booy also pointed to world-first work being done at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research on how long-term immunity to Covid works, and the possibilities of a T-cell vaccine. The new University of Melbourne research also adds to existing international work that shows the importance of T-cells. South African researchers have found that T-cells can robustly protect against Omicron after it has evaded antibodies. A small South African study that has not yet been peer-reviewed also suggested T-cells have a role to play.",News/Australia news,"T-cells can fight Omicron when antibodies fail to, Australian researchers say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/t-cells-can-fight-omicron-when-antibodies-fail-to-australian-researchers-say
1/4/2022,"This is not a unique story. I’m trapped in a house with my husband and two teens, and we’re all sick.  My 19-year-old son was the first to go down on Tuesday, 28 December. In the morning he developed stomach cramps, vomiting, a migraine and a high fever. I bought him the last rapid antigen test at the local servo. It came up as positive. And so began our efforts to be included in New South Wales’ latest Covid figures. A week later and we are still not part of that count. I live in northern NSW and last Tuesday was a public holiday. I rang three public hospitals to find out which testing centres were open and learnt that every testing centre was overrun and our chances of getting in were Buckley’s. I was undeterred. My son had severe asthma as a child. Would Omicron trigger his asthma? I’m probably an anxious mother, but I wanted an official diagnosis in case he needed hospital care. I also believe that the state and federal governments need to chart the spread of infection because it’s their job to deliver resources to hospitals and tighten pandemic restrictions to slow infection. I was determined for us to be included in the Covid count. On Tuesday afternoon we drove to the Byron drive-through testing clinic – the security guard said they couldn’t test any more people. We then headed to Ballina only to be turned away. Lismore and Casino’s drive-throughs were also closed. We went home. My son’s temperature was above 38C that night despite the Nurofen and Panadol. The headaches also started for me. At 6am on Wednesday, my feverish son dragged himself out of bed and I drove him back to a drive-through testing clinic. It was almost 20C, but he wore a hoodie, and brought a blanket and box of tissues. By 9am we’d crawled to the front of the drive-through queue. I told the nurse he had a positive RAT and a history of severe asthma. She said his results would be fast-tracked and back in 50 hours. I was surprised that 50 hours was considered fast, but still grateful he was a priority. We drove home from the testing centre and into the twilight zone. The whole family became unwell, and days of high temperatures, strange dreams, headaches, dizziness and exhaustion followed. Since the summer influx of visitors to the northern rivers, one member of my family has received a Covid exposure site alert every second day. It has been like playing dodgem cars with Covid. We got hit. Our region is popular with tourists so they add to rapidly increasing case numbers, but it also has a high percentage of elderly and First Nations residents and a limited number of ICU beds. I hope our health system holds in coming weeks. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet has told journalists: “We will tailor our response to the situation that comes. If evidence changes, we will have targeted restrictions in place.” For seven days, we have been trying to contribute to “the evidence”. Yesterday – 122 hours after being swabbed – my son and I received our positive results so I anticipate we will be in today’s figure, exactly a week after he became sick. My husband and daughter will surely be added to the numbers having also been tested. The questions I keep coming back to now are: is the testing system so slow because labs are under-resourced, and the state government did not plan for a contagious new variant and Christmas travel and celebrations causing a surge in cases? Or are numbers rising so quickly it’s simply impossible for labs to keep up? Should we consider Victoria’s lead and look at allowing people to upload RAT results? What is clear though is the latest numbers being given out by government clearly do not reflect daily infection rates. I’ve come to think of the NSW Covid-19 figures as being like a Hubble space telescope – reporting back what happened light years ago.",Opinion/Opinion,I spent a week trying to be counted as a NSW Covid case – I’ve only just succeeded | Christine Tondorf,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/i-spent-a-week-trying-to-be-counted-as-a-nsw-covid-case-ive-only-just-succeeded
1/4/2022,"Australians in regional areas with severe mental health problems will go without help, after “devastating” changes to the telehealth system, psychiatrists warn. Recent federal government reforms removed a 50% loading for some rural psychiatric services, meaning some types of consultations providers will no longer be able to bulk-bill. They will have to absorb the costs or pass them on to patients.   Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dr Vivienne James, a psychiatrist at Sydney’s Gordon Clinic, says she is “devastated” and her patients will be “distressed” about the changes, which came into effect on 1 January. “It is simply not financially viable for us to continue seeing these patients,” she said. “This will leave many patients distressed and, dare I say it, suicidal, as some of these people are extremely isolated and have little support. They will not be able to pay to see us and will have to be discharged back to their GPs. “Personally, I am devastated by these changes.” Grahame Gee, a credentialed mental health nurse, said it was “unethical” that he and his colleagues were “blindsided” by the changes, which were announced a couple of weeks before Christmas. His patients have complex mental health needs and many also have histories of physical and sexual abuse and intimate partner violence. “Most have limited financial means and struggle to pay gap fees,” he said. “Their recovery depends upon access to this service … I had patients in tears … Others said they would have to cancel their appointments.” On 13 December the federal health department announced $106m to make telehealth a permanent part of primary healthcare. On 16 December it announced changes to the Medical Benefits Scheme, including two new telehealth items, 17 amended items and the scrapping of 128 items, which included item 288 for video psychiatric consultations through GP referrals. Guardian Australia revealed how other changes would affect patients, particularly those with cancer. Assoc Prof Vinay Lakra, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists president, said most of the reforms were welcome, but that fixing some gaps meant others appeared. “People living in a rural area couldn’t afford to see a psychiatrist, but [the rural loading] allowed them to see a psychiatrist without paying a gap. If you’re bulk-billing and that loading is removed, some providers will pass on the cost to the patients and patients might cancel their appointment.” The rural loading was introduced about 10 years ago to encourage the use of telehealth in country Australia, an incentive the health department says is no longer needed. Lakra said that before Covid, the psychiatric community wanted it phased out rather than removed and only phased out if there was another system in place to ensure affordability and accessibility. Covid “hasn’t gone”, he said, and the college wants the MBS item extended for another year. “Twelve months is enough time to prepare a plan … With item 288 there was not enough time,” he said. In a statement, the health department said the new arrangements consolidated telehealth into a single national program, “ensuring universal and equitable access”, and that rural patients will have access to other bulk-billing options.

But according to the statement, there are about 10 times more telephone consultations than there are consultations that attract the loading and more than twice as many video consultations that do not attract the loading. “This is about improving access to video and telephone services provided by GPs, medical specialists and other health professionals that reflect clinical best practice and provides greater flexibility in the healthcare system, depending on the services required,” the statement said. “It is backed by an additional $106m over four years and part of a $308.6m investment by the government to support Australia’s primary care system.”  Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636",News/Australia news,Telehealth changes ‘devastating’ for psychiatry patients in regional areas,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/telehealth-changes-devastating-for-psychiatry-patients-in-regional-areas

Sowing Doubt in Magnetic Fields is a mighty shoegaze epic, with huge synths and guitars draped across a dreamy vocal, echoed to infinity and mixed as if performed from atop a mountain. Across eight albums, Royal Chant have proven they can tackle any style in the wider rock canon – and this more expansive sound is a very welcome juncture. Let’s hope they stay on the mountain awhile. For more: The band’s entire catalogue is worthy of your time. Just dive in. For fans of: Holly Throsby, Antony and the Johnsons, Leonard Cohen Glenn Richards weaves the most delicate melodies on which to drop his weighty lyrical concepts: on love, life, loss and all the other big Ls that have concerned poets for millennia. Augie March has never betrayed a sense of their own time, with ornate arrangements, antiquated language and songs that slowly unfurl as if being pedalled out through a dusty pianola roll. The basic tracks for Clay were recorded in January 2020, before being shelved for all the obvious considerations. Throughout 2021, Richards pieced together the rest of the song, which he confessed had “been pretty much in the ground as far as I was concerned” before he revisited it. The result is a masterful next chapter for one of Australia’s true treasures. For more: Augie March are touring their debut record, Sunset Studies, in March, in celebration of its 20th anniversary. New album Bloodsport & Porn is out now. For fans of: Late Night Sessions, Phoenix, Ty Segall Recorded during the sessions for The Slow Rush and held back due to reasons of taste or timing, it’s not surprising that No Choice slots firmly into the album it was born of: another slice of space-R&B that finds Kevin Parker floating further still into the pop realm, now as much a student of Donna Summer as Donovan. With Parker’s favourite flange setting skipping across the entire track, and guitar solos so fuzzed out they resemble vuvuzelas, this is three-and-a-half minutes of smoked-out bliss. Detractors may point out this is more of the same; fans will love it for this very fact. For more: The Slow Rush deluxe edition is out 18 February. For fans of: Robyn, Doja Cat, Camp Cope Since a very public romantic breakup (at least in indie rock circles), Camp Cope’s Georgia Maq has made no secret of her “historically bad taste”, as she puts it. The song Joe Rogan is not an ode to the divisive bobble-headed podcaster, but a slight on the specific types of men who hero-worship him: who lecture women during first dates; who are turned off by women with opinions; who mansplain perceived inadequacies via lengthy, angry text messages (one of which appears to be captured on the cover art to this single). Music-wise, this is sparkling synth-driven pop, much in the vein of Maq’s solo debut Pleaser, with a sharp message – “there is nothing more dangerous than a man who thinks consent is lame” – and a chorus of friends echoing Maq’s bad taste via a series of voice messages. It’s both fun and frightening. For more: Listen to 2021 single Someone Stranger, with Alice Ivy. For fans of: Treetops, Donovan, MGMT Babe Rainbow deal sun-drenched, lysergic-dripping psychedelia from the back of their touring VW bus, the type of music that casts a bloodshot eye back at the 1960s without ever slipping into parody or pastiche. Smash the Machine goes heavy on the flange and social commentary, bemoaning the ever-whirling machines that seem to be taking bigger bites out of our everyday lives. Like label mates King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, the Byron band are maddeningly prolific; this single follows four quick-fire quality albums. A little more whimsical than the tunes on last year’s Changing Colours, this is the perfect breath of wild sea air to inhale as you enter the new year. For more: Listen to Changing Colours, or 2019’s Today album. For fans of: The Hummingbirds, Jodi Phillis, Love Positions During the late 1980s, Sydney’s the Hummingbirds were part of a pre-grunge movement that saw acts like the Clouds, Ratcat and the Falling Joys brighten the corners of the country with gleeful pop music: breezy but punchy, developed in garages and small pubs. Vocalist Alannah Russack is still peeling off joyous tunes in the same vein, and fans of her familiar sound will instantly fall for Places You Love – the crystalline guitars, the immediate, effortless melody, and her clear, spirited lilt are all in full flight. Like many songs written in the past few years, this one is about perseverance in the face of adversity – with a hefty dose of nostalgia thrown in for good measure. For more: Russack’s album As Memories Pass Each Other will be out soon. For fans of: Flying Nun, the Church, late 80s the Saints Transport Planes is a song of liminal states, which drifts like a daydream transporting you back to the days of 1980s FM radio, with Jeremy Gronow’s voice a dead ringer for Steve Kilbey, a chorus that will stick in your brain for days, perfectly placed backing vocals, references to truckers and Tasmania and transport planes, all driven stick-shift by guitar tones so bright and sunny you need 15+ fluoro zinc to protect you (this is an 80s daydream, remember). For more: Listen to previous single, Island of the Dogs. For fans of: The Sunnyboys, Cheap Trick, Redd Kross Sounding suspiciously vital after 40 years, Hoodoo Gurus’ latest single leaps from the speakers, an immediate power-pop anthem that joins a run of recent one-off singles which suggest that maybe Faulkner and co are gearing up for album number 10 – their first in 12 years. The calls for resilience in the chorus make for a fitting pandemic rallying cry, but this song was actually written pre-Covid (although annexed to a fitting video showing frontline workers struggling with the demands). Hoodoo Gurus are still one of this country’s most underrated gems. For more: Check out recent singles Get Out Of Dodge, and Hung Out to Dry. For fans of: Amy Winehouse, Gin Wigmore, Lanie Lane There’s no shortage of smoky vocalists who have cemented themselves in the post-Amy Winehouse neo soul world; students of Ella Fitzgerald, Etta James and Billie Holiday. Ivy League Records’ latest signee, Wilsn, stands above the pack with You Know Better, which sports a truly jaw-dropping vocal and one hell of a killer chorus, making for the type of rare tune that already sounds like a standard. Horn blasts and propulsion drums help set the mood, but it is the singular talent at the centre of things that makes this more than just another diet-Winehouse offering. For more: Wilsn plays 10 February at the Vanguard, Sydney and 19 February at Lulie Tavern, Melbourne. For fans of: Weddings Parties Anything, Ryan Adams With a voice that has shades of Ryan Adams and Roy Orbison in its pure yearning magic, and a story about a heartbreaking custody disrupt, Ruby (Days Gone By) is both a simple, loving ode to a daughter not seen enough and a dark shot at an embittered ex-lover. The first strums sound unmistakably like To Her Door before the track breaks into its own emotive tale of fractured family life and a protagonist that cannot seem to get out of his own way.

1/4/2022,"Disability groups say the Morrison government’s proposed religious discrimination bill will erode the rights of people with a disability and allow legally protected “hurt and humiliation”. In a submission to the parliamentary joint committee on human rights, more than two dozen disability support organisations have urged the Coalition to abandon the bill in its current form, saying there is widespread concern about its “harmful impacts”.  “We support religious freedom as essential to a thriving democracy, but not at the expense of the rights and freedoms of others,” the group’s submission states. “The religious discrimination bill will encourage prejudice, stigma, denigration, division, and discrimination against people with disability, and undermine all efforts to build and sustain an inclusive Australia.” The organisations – which include peak advocacy groups People With Disability Australia and the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations – raise particular concern about the bill’s controversial statement of belief clause. This part of the proposed legislation says “statements of belief” do not breach discrimination laws, giving legal protection to statements of religious belief or “a belief that the person genuinely considers to relate to the fact of not holding a religious belief”. Examples given in the submission include a person with a disability being told they are suffering a “punishment from God” for their, or their parents’, sins. Or being told they may be “healed” by prayer or by “living virtuously”. Disability advocates say this clause, which would override existing state legislation aimed at protecting people with disability, will result in more discrimination. It warns that a “power imbalance” already exists between people with a disability and the large proportion of disability support services that are faith-based and control the delivery of personal care, housing, community access and emergency relief. “We are concerned the religious discrimination bill will allow people with disability to be demeaned by statements of religious belief that are permitted under this bill, creating an unsafe and harmful environment,” it states. A separate submission from Disability Voices Tasmania says the proposed bill, which was first promised in 2018 and is now in its third iteration, “introduces the right to discriminate in the name of religion”. “People with disability constantly experience ridicule, offensive assumptions, bias, and intimidation. It does not matter whether this arises from hate, prejudice, misguided assumptions, and attitudes towards disability, or because of religious belief – or one person’s interpretation of religious belief,” the group’s chair, Michael Small, said. “What matters is the hurt, humiliation, and long-term impact we experience as a result of it.” Small said the legislation would override the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Act which prohibits conduct that a reasonable person would anticipate would offend, humiliate, intimidate, insult, or ridicule another person on the basis of disability. The proposed overriding of state and territory anti-discrimination laws has also been criticised by equality advocates, who fear protections for the LGBTQ+ community would also be undermined, including state laws banning conversion practices. The Equality Australia chief executive, Anna Brown, told federal parliament’s human rights committee in December that the proposal to override state laws would weaken equal rights. “It’s anathema to our democracy that state laws could be overridden in this way and that these hard-fought-for protections that have existed for decades, in many cases, could be unwound and overridden and undermined by this bill.” The proposed legislation is being scrutinised by two parliamentary inquiries due to report by 4 February – shortly before the scheduled resumption of parliament. The government was unable to pass the legislation in the final sitting of 2021 given deep divisions within the Coalition party room over the bill. Labor is reserving its position on the legislation until the inquiries are completed. But the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has said any new religious discrimination laws should not come at “the expense of discriminating on the basis of other people’s characteristics”.",News/Society,"Coalition’s religious discrimination bill will erode rights of people with disability, advocates say",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/03/coalitions-religious-discrimination-bill-will-erode-rights-of-people-with-disability-advocates-say
1/4/2022,"A positive Covid case has been recorded at the Newmarch House aged care home in Sydney, where 19 people died during an outbreak in 2020, amid growing concern at the strain on the sector’s workforce. As of Monday, there were 1,180 active Covid-19 cases in aged care homes across Australia, with more than 550 each in New South Wales and Victoria.  In the past seven days, the NSW health department has reported the deaths of eight aged care home residents as a result of coronavirus infections acquired inside the facilities. Federal government data suggests a rise in deaths in aged care has coincided with the move by most states to relax restrictions. In 2021 91 people died with Covid in aged care across Australia up to 22 October. By 17 December that figure had more than doubled to 206. At the same time the workforce in NSW, which has experienced record-breaking case numbers, has come under increasing pressure. The Guardian spoke to three aged care workers in the state, all of whom did not wish to be named out of concern for their employment situation. Those in metropolitan areas described a feeling of “desperation” and burnout, with workers in some facilities pulling 16-hour shifts to cover gaps in the workforce and nearby hospitals refusing to take new Covid-positive patients unless “absolutely necessary”. One worker at a regional facility in the state’s north said six staff had quit due to low pay and burnout, leaving them woefully unprepared in the event of an outbreak. “I think we’re going to get Covid in the facility,” they said. “I think we’re going to lose more staff. I think the current staff who are willing to stay are going to burn out and get sick themselves. I think we’re going into a state of disaster. People will die.” On Sunday the operator of Newmarch, Anglicare, notified residents’ families that a staff member had tested positive for the virus after a “community exposure”. Newmarch said another member of staff and a resident had been identified as close contacts, but that no further positive cases had been identified as yet. “Our highest priority is the safety and wellbeing of residents and staff, while providing the best possible care to residents in the home,” Newmarch said in its email to the families. “As a further precaution, PCR testing of [the] staff and residents will take place today.” The case has put the families of residents on high alert, prompting memories of the devastating outbreak in which 37 residents tested positive and 19 died after a staff member worked a shift while infectious in April 2020. At the time it was the deadliest outbreak of the pandemic in Australia. “My heart sank, it really did,” Elizabeth Lane, whose mother is a resident at Newmarch, told the Guardian. “My mum is at the end of life and the idea that there could be another outbreak and I wouldn’t be able to see her or be with her if she passed away, nothing would break my heart more. “I don’t know if people realise the impact of what happened on the residents there, the decline in a lot of the older people. Because of the lockdown and everything that has happened, you go in there and the atmosphere is just so quiet.” Gerard Hayes, the national president of the Health Services Union, said he believed the situation was going to get “dramatically worse” around the country over the next few weeks. “I would usually have an optimistic view that if we apply this or apply that, we can manage through. I don’t have an answer this time,” Hayes said. “This problem manifested itself some time ago [and] we chose to do very little about it. “Both the government and opposition have been talking a big game on aged care until it’s come to now. What are [the] Labor and Liberal [parties] going to do for the people who actually built this country, who put us in a position we are in today? “I need answers – from both sides of government. At the moment all I’m hearing about in the federal sphere is nuclear submarines and bullet trains.” Hayes said the low pay in the industry, with a base rate of $23 an hour, was not enough to attract and keep new workers under normal conditions, let alone during a time of crisis. Paul Sadler, the chief executive of Aged and Community Services Australia, said pay was one of a number of issues that had not been addressed since the royal commission and the first wave of the pandemic. “What we are seeing now is federal and state governments warning all businesses they could be losing 10 to 25% of their staff, to a period of time when they’re Covid-positive and can’t come into work,” Sadler said. “I think our members feel like it’s an impossible situation on a daily basis for the moment. They’re trying to balance the risk; they’re trying to enable residents to have the best life possible; they’re trying to keep out a deadly disease; they’re trying to manage staff rosters when there’s immense pressure on the availability of staff.” “It’s the toughest time aged care services have ever been through.”  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokesperson for the federal health department said it was working closely with states and territories to provide surge workforce support when needed. “As soon as the department is notified of a case in an aged care worker or resident, a case manager will be appointed to support the facility,” the spokesperson said. “This includes facilitating access to commonwealth programs and supports such as PPE and surge workforce. “In addition, surge workforce support continues to be provided to supplement aged care providers’ strategies. This includes access to dedicated nursing staff and support from agency workers, as well as agreements with private hospitals to provide support if states seek to utilise this resource.” The federal government changed guidelines on Saturday to allow employees who are close contacts to return to work earlier from isolation where a lack of staff was having a “high impact” on services. A national cabinet meeting on Wednesday is expected to address the issue of staffing in aged care.",News/Australia news,‘My heart sank’: Covid returns to Newmarch House as aged care sector fears new crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/my-heart-sank-covid-returns-to-newmarch-house-as-aged-care-sector-fears-new-crisis
1/4/2022,"Covid-positive nurses are being recalled to work in hospitals across New South Wales – in breach of state health protocols – as hospital managers resort to desperate measures to staff facilities buckling under the Omicron outbreak. Guardian Australia has been contacted by multiple nurses working across several hospitals in the state who are alarmed at finding themselves working alongside Covid-positive colleagues, as 2,500 health workers are in isolation across NSW.  The public hospitals span three local health districts in NSW and include major Sydney hospitals and smaller regional facilities. All of the nurses say they had received unofficial, verbal advice from their hospitals in recent days that Covid-positive nurses could leave their mandated isolation to work, provided they were asymptomatic and wore personal protective equipment. However, some claimed they saw Covid-positive nurses on wards with obvious symptoms, including coughing and sneezing. At one Sydney hospital, the Covid-positive nurses appeared to be limited to working in Covid wards. However, at other hospitals, nurses said they were treating non-Covid patients and interacting with Covid-negative staff. “God help any non-Covid patient in a hospital right now. They are sitting ducks,” one nurse told Guardian Australia. “It’s like everyone has given up. I’m absolutely devastated. It’s a circus … positive nurses working with healthy staff and non-Covid patients.” Protocols for healthcare workers in NSW have been loosened in recent days, including an exemption announced on New Year’s Eve to allow workers who are close contacts that should be isolating for seven days, to return to work if they are asymptomatic and deemed essential by their employer. However, a NSW Health spokesperson confirmed that Covid-positive nurses do not fall under this exemption. “Healthcare workers in NSW who test positive to Covid-19 are required to isolate at home and are not permitted to return to work until they are released from isolation,” they said. Nurses who expressed concern about allowing Covid-positive colleagues to return to work stressed that the advice was given in an unofficial capacity, as managers were left with few other options to ensure patients could be cared for. The nurses requested their names and employers remain confidential to avoid identifying them. The revelation comes days after Guardian Australia obtained a leaked memo that revealed critically understaffed public hospitals in NSW were planning to fly in nurses from overseas. Desperate attempts also included managers begging local staff to cancel leave and offering $250 daily incentives on top of public holiday penalties. Meanwhile, the western NSW LHD is offering nurses $823 a week on top of their wage to work in the region during January. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, has said the health system “remains strong”, and his health minister, Brad Hazzard, has also defended the system. On Monday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, backed up these comments, insisting Australia’s health system could manage the “very different virus” of the Omicron variant. However, the NSW Nurses and Midwives Association general secretary, Brett Holmes, accused governments of presenting an overly optimistic version of the state of the health system. Holmes said reports of Covid-positive nurses returning to work “shows the level of desperation we’ve got into our health system”. “To try and force potential sick and infectious staff into the hospitals to work, that places everyone at risk.” Holmes told Guardian Australia he was “absolutely opposed” to allowing Covid-positive nurses to return to work before finishing their isolation and testing negative – but noted such a policy had occurred in parts of Europe and the United States during the peaks of their outbreaks. “There has been discussion about this here, because it’s been done overseas, and talk of the idea is no doubt rife amongst desperate managers looking for staff. They might well be preparing for this,” Holmes said. Holmes added the practice risked spreading Covid to vulnerable patients in hospital for unrelated reasons. “We know these types of patients can die with Covid. If nurses [are] knowingly being told to go in there and play a bit of Russian roulette as to whether their PPE is perfect all the time, it’s an extraordinary expectation to work in those circumstances,” Holmes said.
