12/27/2021,"Germans across large parts of the country face a tightening of rules governing both private and public spaces in an effort to slow down a wave of coronavirus infections triggered by the Omicron variant. Gatherings both indoors and outdoors are to be restricted in size from Monday, with leisure facilities – from gyms to swimming pools and nightclubs to cinemas – shutting in several states and restaurants facing earlier closing times.  New-year fireworks displays, typically carried out by private households and held on the majority of German streets, have been cancelled for a second year in a row. Tighter protection measures will apply to those who have so far not taken up the offer to be vaccinated, or those who for medical reasons are not able to do so, but the vaccinated and those who have recovered from Covid-19 will face a new range of limitations. Private gatherings are being restricted in areas which had not already introduced the rule in the run-up to Christmas to a maximum of 10 people, for those who are vaccinated or recovered. In the case of unvaccinated people, up to two other external people per household are allowed to come together. Children under 14 are excluded from the quota. A requirement to wear a medical mask, introduced almost a year ago, remains in place in shops and on public transport, as does the need to show a vaccine certificate in those venues where access is only possible for those who are vaccinated. Policymakers say the plan is to dampen the spread of the far more infectious Omicron variant, and to use the time gained from slowing it down, to deliver booster shots to as many Germans as possible. Just under 71% of Germans have so far received two doses of vaccine, and just under 36% have received a booster jab. Before Christmas, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, set a target for vaccines to have been delivered to 80% of the population by 7 January. But the government admitted on Monday it was behind schedule and would have to extend the deadline to the end of January. Germany’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, has repeatedly said he is closely observing events in the UK and speaking to his counterpart there, where Omicron is thought to be around two to three weeks ahead of where it is in Germany. Omicron has so far been detected in all 16 German states but has not yet got the upper hand over the Delta variant, which remains dominant but is expected to be overtaken in the coming days. Experts say Germany could have up to 700,000 cases a day leading to mass quarantines. Emergency measures have been put in place to allow the army and the federal agency for technical relief to step in and ensure vital services are upheld such as refuse collection and energy provision. Resistance to the protective measures led to new demonstrations on Sunday, most visibly in Berlin and the city of Schweinfurt in Bavaria, where police were attacked as protesters turned violent. More protests are scheduled across the country in the coming days. Politicians have been reluctant to talk of introducing a further nationwide lockdown, hoping instead that the current wave of measures will suffice. Christian Drosten, head virologist at the Charité hospital in Berlin, said it “remained to be seen when and whether” the measures would work. If not, he suggested introducing restrictions that would only allow those who had been boosted with a third injection and therefore had far greater protection than those who were double-jabbed, to enjoy wider freedom. Markus Söder, the leader of Bavaria, led the call by politicians to reduce the length of time for which people had to go into quarantine, to just five days if they were symptom free, arguing that otherwise large parts of German life would be in danger of grounding to a halt as Omicron took hold.",News/World news,Germany toughens Covid restrictions as Omicron variant takes hold,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/27/germany-toughens-covid-restrictions-omicron-variant-takes-hold
12/27/2021,"Officials in the Balearic Islands will seek to limit cruise ships to a maximum of three vessels a day at its largest port, in a deal described as the first of its kind in Spain. Starting in 2022, arrivals at Palma port in Mallorca would be limited when possible to three cruise ships a day, with one of these vessels allowed to be a megacruise liner carrying more than 5,000 people, the regional government said.  Calling the deal “historic”, officials estimated it would result in a 13% drop in cruise ship arrivals at the port – which ranks among the busiest cruise ports in the Mediterranean – compared with 2019. The procession of cruise ships passing through Palma has for years been a source of friction, pitting environmental concerns against the economic benefits of a sector in which as many as eight ships arrive on the same day, disgorging more than 22,000 people into the maze of narrow streets in Palma’s old town. In 2019, when more than 2.6 million cruise ship tourists visited the Balearic Islands, more than 25 organisations joined forces to call for the vessels to be limited to one arrival a day with a maximum of 4,000 tourists. “The megacruise ship tourism arriving in Palma has grown in a way that is unsustainable and undesirable for our city, leading to serious environmental impact and increasing social protest,” they noted in a joint manifesto. “Tourist overcrowding devalues our historical and cultural heritage, converting urban space into a theme park for visitors only and degrading the tourist experience for others.” The regional government said the deal had been more than two years in the making. “It means setting, for the first time, a real limit to the arrival of cruise ship passengers to Palma, something that would not have been possible without the will of the sector,” Iago Negueruela, the regional official in charge of economy and tourism, said. Similar deals have been struck for the ports of Dubrovnik in Croatia and Aalborg in Denmark, Negueruela told the Spanish newspaper El País. “We’re the first to do so in a port as large as Palma.” As cruise ship arrivals were often scheduled months in advance, the new daily limits would include fewer than 20 exemption days in order to honour previously signed contracts, the government said. On these days the limit for cruise ship arrivals would be bumped up to four, though the number of total passengers would be capped at 59,500 per week. The five-year deal was criticised by critics and proponents of cruise ship tourism. Some, such as the Platform Against MegaCruises, said little would seemingly change. “Three cruise ships a day – one of them with a capacity of more than 5,000 passengers – still seems to us a very high figure for what the city can bear,” it said. “The regional government has missed out on the opportunity to make a courageous decision to safeguard residents of the Balearic Islands, their environment, their health and their right to the city.” The competing platform Yes to Cruises described the push to limit the sector as an “error” that could have grave repercussions for an economy, after a 2015 study by the port authority estimated that tourism linked to cruises supported more than 5,500 jobs and contributed €256m in direct and indirect revenues to the region. The spokesperson for the platform, the local tour guide Álex Fraile, suggested this would set a precedent: “Is the next step to restrict the arrival of aircraft at [Mallorca’s] Son Sant Joan airport?” .",News/World news,Palma to limit cruise ships after environmental concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/27/mallorca-port-cruise-ship-limit-palma-spain
12/27/2021,"ABritish cheesemaker who predicted Brexit would cost him hundreds of thousands of pounds in exports has called the UK’s departure from the EU single market a disaster, after losing his entire wholesale and retail business in the bloc over the past year. Simon Spurrell, the co-founder of the Cheshire Cheese Company, said personal advice from a government minister to pursue non-EU markets to compensate for his losses had proved to be “an expensive joke”. “It turns out our greatest competitor on the planet is the UK government because every time they do a fantastic deal, they kick us out of that market – starting with the Brexit deal,” he said.  Spurrell predicted in January that Brexit would cost him £250,000 in sales. “We lost £270,000, so I got one thing right,” he said, describing the post-Brexit EU trade deal as the “biggest disaster that any government has ever negotiated in the history of trade negotiations”. His online retail business was hit immediately after the Brexit negotiator David Frost failed to secure a frictionless trade deal addressing sales to individual customers in the EU. Spurrell said he had lost 20% of sales overnight after discovering he needed to provide a £180 health certificate on each order, including gift packs costing £25 or £30. He said the viability of his online retail had come to a “dead stop”. After he embarked on a personal crusade to draw attention to the plight of UK exporters involving almost 200 media interviews around the world, he was invited to an online meeting with Victoria Prentis, a minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. She suggested that emerging markets could compensate for the Brexit-related hole in the Cheshire Cheese Company’s finances. Spurrell said he had pursued new business in Norway and Canada but post-Brexit trade deals sealed by the government had put barriers in place. “We no longer have any ability to deal with the EU as our three distributors in Germany, France and Italy have said we have become too expensive because of the new checks and paperwork. “And now we’ve also lost Norway since the trade deal, as duty for wholesale is 273%. Then we tried Canada but what the government didn’t tell us is that duty of 244% is applied on any consignment over $20 [£15].” That meant Canadian customers who ordered a gift pack worth £50, including transport fees, were asked to pay £178 extra in duty when the courier arrived at their door, Spurrell said. “As you can imagine, customers were saying: ‘You can take that back, we don’t want it anymore’.” Norwegian duty on a £30 cheese pack amounted to £190 extra, he said. Spurrell is now pursuing the domestic market with greater vigour but says the cost of marketing has gone “through the roof” because all his competitors are having to do the same. “Before we could sell across the EU, now we are all fishing in the same pond. We used to be the biggest online sellers but now we are absolutely bombarded with attacks by all our cheese rivals because they are buying all the ads on Google to try to beat us. These are competitors who would never have bothered us before,” he said. The “sad” thing, Spurrell said, is that it is the small to medium-sized companies such as his, important employers up and down the country, have been hammered by Brexit and other trade deals struck by the government, rather than giant rivals. He noted that the Canadian company Saputo, with a market capital of more than C$14bn (£8.3bn), had done well out of the Norwegian deal as producers of three of the four “premier” cheeses singled out for “significantly reduced tariffs”.",News/Business,Brexit: ‘the biggest disaster any government has ever negotiated’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/27/brexit-the-biggest-disaster-that-any-government-has-ever-negotiated
12/27/2021,"Brendan Rodgers says it is “ridiculous” that Leicester City have to play Manchester City and Liverpool in 48 hours as he battles an ever deepening injury crisis. Ryan Bertrand is the latest Leicester player to become unavailable after he was injured during the warm-up before Sunday’s 6-3 defeat at Manchester City, with Rodgers having to remove him from the substitutes’ list. The Leicester manager had been forced to name Jamie Vardy and Wilfred Ndidi on the bench despite the forward’s tight hamstring and midfielder’s accumulation of minutes.  Rodgers was already without four of his first-choice defence - Jonny Evans, Caglar Soyuncu, Ricardo Pereira and James Justin – after recent injuries, plus forwards Harvey Barnes and Patson Daka. After the loss at the Etihad Stadium against the leaders, Rodgers must gather his depleted resources for the home game against second-placed Liverpool. “It’s a ridiculous schedule,” said Rodgers. “We all know that players aren’t fully recovered for 72 hours after a game, so for us to be playing on a Tuesday against Liverpool it is ridiculous. However, we have to play the game so there will be virtually no physical work, just recovery and then we’ll look at video images and prepare.” Rodgers also pointed to how Liverpool will not have played for seven days – since knocking Leicester out of the Carabao Cup last Wednesday – because their game against Leeds was called off, while City had a clear week before facing them. He said: “This period [off for both teams] clearly is a big advantage and it is just coincidence the context of these two games is probably one of the first weeks Manchester City have had off so they were fresh and ready, and Liverpool haven’t played since our cup game so they’ll be able to bring players back in. That’s what we have to deal with. It’s a huge challenge for us but it’s a challenge we’re up for. We keep fighting and we keep working. “We’ll train a little bit later [on Monday], we’ll have a meal together. It’s a very quick turnaround and to play Manchester City and Liverpool in quick succession is a big challenge, especially with the squads they have. We’ll do what we’ve done in this period – our very best – and that’s what we’re prepared to do on Tuesday.” Vardy and Ndidi may be able to start at Anfield. “Wilf has played a lot of football for us so he hasn’t had a chance to rest,” said Rodgers. “To put him into [the City] game would have been really tough. Hopefully they’ll be fine for Tuesday’s game.” Of Bertrand, Rodgers said: “It looks highly unlikely [for Liverpool], he couldn’t bend his leg. Especially with the quick turnaround he may struggle. Jonny [Evans] will be another three weeks so he’s still out for a period and Harvey [Barnes] isn’t due back until about the 29th.”",Sport/Football,Leicester’s Brendan Rodgers slams ‘ridiculous’ fixture list amid injury crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/27/leicesters-brendan-rodgers-slams-ridiculous-fixture-list-amid-injury-crisis
