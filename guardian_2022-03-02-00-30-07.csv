3/2/2022,"The UK government has said Jaguar Land Rover’s decision to suspend exports to Russia will help to isolate the country’s economy, after Britain’s largest carmaker said it would pause deliveries. JLR is owned by India’s Tata but builds most of its cars in the UK. It said on Monday night it would pause deliveries to Russia because of “trading challenges” related to the “current global context”, without mentioning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine explicitly. The UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said JLR was one of “a rapidly growing number of companies and governments joining the whole international community in isolating Russia, both diplomatically and financially”, in a Twitter post on Tuesday. I welcome Jaguar Land Rover's decision to pause the delivery of vehicles into the Russian market.There is now a rapidly growing number of companies and governments joining the whole international community in isolating Russia, both diplomatically and financially. Carmakers – along with companies across almost every industry – are scrambling to assess their exposure to Russia as the US, EU and UK work together to cut it off from the global economy via sanctions. While the movement of non-military cars or parts has not been blocked, several Russian banks are subject to blocking sanctions which could complicate cross-border trade. The conflict has added yet another difficulty for the global car industry, which has been crippled by disruption over the last two years – to the point that JLR was forced to fly in crucial key fobs in suitcases at the start of pandemic. Production has been held back most notably in recent months by shortages of semiconductor computer chips. Japanese carmaker Toyota suffered a different problem this week, when its production across Japan was halted owing to an alleged cyberattack on a supplier to all of its factories. Toyota is a leader in lean manufacturing to cut costs, meaning it does not have stockpiles of components to fall back on. The supplier, Kojima Industries, said on Tuesday it had found an undisclosed threatening message written in English on one of its systems, Reuters reported. Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, had said on Monday that the government would investigate whether Russia was involved. The Russia conflict has already had serious knock-on effects for carmakers. Germany’s Volkswagen has had to pause production at two German plants for days this week because of shortages of components from Ukraine, while its Skoda brand has also had to limit production for the same reason. Russia is a relatively minor market for UK car plants, whose exports are predominantly aimed at EU countries. It is thought that the UK exports fewer than 10,000 cars a year to Russia out of an annual production on 860,000 in 2021. However, there are Aston Martin, Bentley and Rolls-Royce showrooms in Moscow and St Petersburg, as well as dealers stocking cars from BMW-owned Mini. A JLR spokesman said: “Jaguar Land Rover’s first priority is the wellbeing of our entire workforce and their families, as well as those within our extended network. The current global context also presents us with trading challenges so we are pausing the delivery of vehicles into the Russian market and continually monitoring the situation on behalf of our global customer base.” Other UK factories have so far been less affected. Nissan’s Sunderland factory, the largest single plant in the UK, does not export to Russia. Nissan supplies the Russian market with cars made at its plant in St Petersburg, which is still operating. A Nissan spokesman said: “We continue to monitor events closely and we remain focused on supporting our employees and partners.”",News/Business,UK welcomes Jaguar Land Rover decision to pause Russia exports,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/01/uk-welcomes-jaguar-land-rover-decision-to-pause-russia-exports
3/2/2022,"Jürgen Klopp believes that talk of Liverpool winning the quadruple is crazy, with the manager citing how even Manchester City have not been able to achieve it. Klopp’s team beat Chelsea 11-10 on penalties at Wembley on Sunday to claim the Carabao Cup. With Liverpool six points behind City in the league and still in the FA Cup – Norwich are their visitors for Wednesday’s fifth-round tie – and Champions League, the manager was asked about Liverpool achieving an unprecedented clean sweep of trophies. “No team in the history of English football ever won the quadruple, right? Because it’s really difficult,” Klopp said. “We are not even close to thinking about crazy stuff like that. We have won the Carabao Cup, we are behind City in the league and now we have Norwich in the FA Cup after 120 minutes on Sunday. Even Manchester City with all their quality did not win it. The reality is [that] to win something you have to be focused on the next step and the one after that – that’s what we do. “I don’t see it as a compliment [if people think they can] but it’s better people think we can do good things rather than be useless. I don’t need this kind of compliment – we are close to nothing at the moment. We face a lot of good teams between now and the end of May.

3/2/2022,"For centuries, organists have almost all been male, and the magnificent instruments from which rich and vibrant sound emerges have reflected that. Now a campaign has been launched for adjustable organ benches to be installed to help the growing number of female organists to reach the instrument’s pedals without risking back pain or even toppling forwards. The Society of Women Organists (SWO) says adjustable benches would increase opportunities for women and young people to play. Two-thirds of almost 500 respondents to a recent SWO survey said they did not have an adjustable bench at their usual venue, and almost half said the lack of one had affected their performance. One said: “Benches and the organs themselves being so big make me feel inadequate or not the right sort of person to play the organ sometimes.” Another said organ-playing frequently resulted in backache. Cathedrals and larger churches usually have fully adjustable benches, according to the SWO. But many smaller churches – where female organists are more likely to be found – have a fixed-height bench that is suitable for the average man but too high for the average woman. The average male height in the UK is 5ft 9in, and the average female height is 5ft 3in. Men make up 90% of permanent directors of music and organists in English and Welsh cathedrals. Marion Lees McPherson (5ft 3in), of the Edinburgh Society of Organists, said the lack of adjustable benches had put her off learning the organ as a teenager. She later returned to the instrument, which she has now been playing for 35 years. “The organ world has always been male-dominated and stuck in its ways,” she said. “You have to use your feet when you play, so it’s a huge problem – and especially difficult if you’re asked to play at a wedding or funeral or concert at an unfamiliar venue. “You have to balance on the edge of the bench, and hold on with your core strength to stop you falling flat on the keys. High heels can help. It’s always been something we’ve had to put up with, but we’re hoping to get people to speak out, to say this is unsatisfactory.” Sir Andrew Parmley, the director of the Royal College of Organists, gave his “hearty support” to the campaign, saying it aimed to “ensure equal access to the organ irrespective of a person’s height”. Katelyn Emerson, an international concert organist, said the campaign could “help the organ to become more accessible to and help prevent injuries in players of all heights”. The SWO, which was set up in 2019 and now has 204 members, said fully adjustable benches cost about £1,800 but cheaper solutions were available.",Arts/Music,Bench campaign aims to bring organ-playing within reach of more women,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/01/bench-campaign-aims-to-bring-organ-playing-within-reach-of-more-women

3/2/2022,"A man shot and killed his three daughters and a chaperone before turning the gun on himself at a church in the Sacramento, California, suburbs on Monday, authorities said. Deputies had been called to the church in the Arden-Arcade neighborhood of Sacramento on Monday evening after a church employee had heard gunshots and called 911, said Sgt Rod Grassmann with the Sacramento county sheriff’s office. The deputies found five people dead, Grassmann said, including the gunman and three girls ages nine, 10 and 13. . The shooting had occurred in the main sanctuary area, he said. Later on Monday evening, the Sacramento county sheriff, Scott Jones, said investigators believe that the shooter had been estranged from the children’s mother, who had a restraining order against him. Investigators believe the shooting happened during a supervised visit with the children, Jones added. The fourth victim, an adult, was the chaperone. The shooter’s identity wasn’t immediately released. Officials didn’t know if the family members belonged to the church, which sits on a mostly residential block near a commercial area east of downtown Sacramento. It wasn’t immediately known how many people were at the church or if there were any services or activities at the time of the shooting. Another senseless act of gun violence in America - this time in our backyard. In a church with kids inside. Absolutely devastating. Our hearts go out to the victims, their families and their communities. We are working closely with local law enforcement. “This is an unspeakable tragedy,” said Darrell Steinberg, the Sacramento mayor. “It happens too often, and tonight it happened in our backyard.”",News/US news,Sacramento church shooting: three children among five dead,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/sacramento-church-shooting-children-among-dead
3/2/2022,"The mayor of the western Ukrainian city of Lviv has called on Boris Johnson to seize the villas of Russian oligarchs living in London and to use them to accommodate Ukrainian refugees fleeing Vladimir Putin’s invasion and military onslaught. In an interview with the Guardian, Andriy Sadovyi said the UK and other Nato member countries had to establish an immediate no-fly zone over Ukraine in order to save “millions of lives”. “If it happened we could avoid humanitarian disaster,” he said. The country was facing a “David and Goliath” struggle against one of the world’s most powerful armies, he added, saying: “Ukraine personifies David.” Asked if Ukraine could win, he said: “We have to win. What we have done so far has surprised the world. “It’s already part of victory. Can you imagine the same morale and combat spirit in any other country? We are experiencing historic times for humankind. Putin will go down in history side by side with Hitler and other war criminals.” The city of Lviv, about 40 miles (70km) from the border of Poland, has been flooded with refugees since Russia’s attack on Ukraine six days ago. The Kremlin has not targeted the Unesco-listed city famed for its ornate classical and baroque buildings – or its now-closed civilian airport. Sadovyi said it was only a matter of time before Russia began targeting Lviv, Ukraine’s sixth biggest city. He said: “Putin has not bombed us so far. He’s committing genocide in Kharkiv, Kyiv and elsewhere. But I think his plan is to occupy the whole territory of Ukraine and to recreate the USSR. He’s taken Belarus. Now he wants us.” There are long queues of cars stretching dozens of kilometres of desperate Ukrainians trying to cross into Poland. Sadovyi said Lviv and western Ukraine could accommodate 3 million people displaced from fighting in other parts of the country. “The enemy has entered our land. It’s killing our kids,” he said. He said he had just got off a call with other Ukrainian mayors including Vitali Klitschko in Kyiv and Vadym Boichenko in Mariupol. The eastern port city on the Sea of Azov was encircled and under heavy attack, Sadovyi said. “Its mayor told me 20 minutes ago Russian marines are landing,” he said. Sadovyi was scathing about western leaders and their failure to taken action against Putin before last week’s invasion. “They expressed deep concern. We heard a lot of blah, blah, blah. We need less talk and more action,” he said, adding that EU nations had allowed Russia to modernise its army by paying it “billions and billions” for oil and gas. He added: “Joe Biden was US vice-president when Putin took Crimea. What we need now is for Boris Johnson to start freezing the bank accounts of Russian oligarchs in London and to seize their luxury villas. It would be better to use them to house Ukrainian refugees,” he said. “Johnson needs to call Putin and say: ‘Sorry Volodya, things have changed.’” Other Ukrainians made the same point on Tuesday. At a press conference in Poland, a Ukrainian journalist asked the prime minister why the children of Russian oligarchs were still allowed to live in London at a time when Ukrainian children were sheltering in basements under Kremlin bombardment. Incredibly powerful moment at Boris Johnson’s press conference in Poland pic.twitter.com/QHgWfjjrHv Compared with other Ukrainian cities, life in Lviv is still relatively normal. Air raid sirens sound several times a day. Armed soldiers guard government buildings, with sandbags in place. Molotov cocktail factories have sprung up, following a patriotic appeal by the mayor to make bombs. There is a 10pm curfew. But under the surface, anxiety about the war is everywhere. One mother had pasted a home-made sign in blue crayon on the front and back windows of her car. It said: “Children” in Russian. All non-essential shops are shut and cash is in short supply, with queues outside banks. Supermarkets have run out of some goods. Sadovyi, 52, was a presidential candidate in 2019 and is the former leader of Ukraine’s Self Reliance party. He said he understood Russia well because he had lived in Moscow in the late 1980s while doing Soviet military service. Five years ago, he visited York to do a course on emergency planning, he said. Putin’s decision this week to put Russia’s nuclear forces in a state of high alert raised further questions about his mental health, he said, adding: “Right now he’s trying to blackmail the world.” There were rumours Putin had chosen to invade on 22 February – 22 02 2022 – because of its mystical significance, he said. The mayor continued: “Lviv has always been a safe city. If he decides to bomb Lviv we can compare him to the Taliban. We are talking about world cultural heritage. Any such move would be crazy. “It’s our land. Russia wants to turn us into slaves. By God’s will we will remain a free people.”",News/World news,"Put Ukrainian refugees in oligarchs’ London houses, Lviv mayor says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/put-ukrainian-refugees-in-oligarchs-london-houses-lviv-mayor-says
3/2/2022,"Over his three terms as president of the Philippines from 1965, Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda were able to cream off some $10bn of the nation’s assets through offshore banks. New revelations that a close associate of the dictator was also able to maintain an account with Credit Suisse as late as 2006 therefore comes as no surprise to Manila-born Pio Abad. For a decade the artist has been making work under the title The Collection of Jane Ryan and William Saunders, a reference to the aliases the couple used with the Swiss bank. “It’s funny when a 10-year project becomes news,” says Abad, who is now London-based. “These institutions are very culpable for what happened in the Philippines.” This week the artist, working alongside British jewellery designer Frances Wadsworth Jones, launches the latest iteration of The Collection of Jane Ryan and William Saunders, having digitally recreated the huge stash of gems Imelda Marcos tried to smuggle out of the country in 1986 when, the couple having been deposed, she and her children were exiled to Hawaii. “I’m endlessly trying to get to the granular truth of this history,” Abad says. “It’s rendering these details in high resolution. There’s elections coming soon in the Philippines and Marcos Jr, the son, is currently leading the polls. Historical amnesia is in the air.” The actual jewels were repatriated to Manila, where they’ve sat in the vaults of the central bank. Wadsworth Jones spent three years building the digital replicas from just a couple of photographs made available by Christie’s, the auction house that, in 2016, was approached by the government about selling the hoard. After the authoritarian populist Rodrigo Duterte was elected later that year, the sale fell through. One Cartier tiara has more than 21m surfaces which Wadsworth Jones painstakingly rendered. From the website of the Cultural Center of the Philippines, an arts institution opened by Imelda Marcos herself, people will be able to overlay 3D images of the jewels on to the world, or wear them using a virtual reality app. “It is a gesture of accountability where it doesn’t exist in the real world,” Abad says. “I like to think an exhibition can become a place of restitution, where justice, however small, can be performed.” It is not the first time the artist has shown the copies. The digital files were used originally to create 3D-printed replicas, rendered in a dull white plastic, to show at the Honolulu biennial in 2019. “It was as if this jewellery was returning to the scene of the crime. But maybe as ghosts. They were a desaturated version of the sparkly gems,” Abad says. That work is now in the collection of the Tate. Alongside each bracelet and necklace, a small plaque is displayed noting the market value, and what that could have paid for in terms of national infrastructure or government aid. “A pink diamond for instance could have bought two airports. A suite of bracelets could have provided vaccinations for thousands of kids. We wanted them viewed not for their aesthetic value but in terms of the painful possibilities that have been lost.” Abad has been dogged in his pursuit of the Marcoses and their wanton excess. Over the past 10 years he has recreated Imelda’s dresses; produced a sculpture in the shape of a shell-adorned clock the first lady once owned; and distributed a series of postcards replicating the couple’s vast collection of Old Masters. “Imelda’s imagination was shaped by a western, imperial, Hollywood or Rhode Island vision of glamour and success,” Abad notes. “She’s wearing this guise of sophistication through these baubles, and through the Queen Anne-era silverware she had.” Abad’s parents were both prominent activists against Marcos’s corrupt and brutal regime. “They met as labour organisers. They were really young, late teens, working with farmers and fisherfolk trying to understand their concerns, trying to work with unions. This was in the mid 1970s, the depths of martial law.” On 26 February 1986, they were among the first of the protesters to storm the presidential palace. Abad has a photograph of his mother grinning next to a kitschy painting of Ferdinand Marcos as an Adam-like figure in the Garden of Eden. “This was a very pure moment, as these moments are, before they had to pick up the pieces,” Abad says. He also saw the painting in the flesh. “My first school field trip was to the palace, when the basement had become this ad-hoc museum of all the Marcoses’ stuff. My first museum experience was looking at loot. That’s shaped everything.” In 2012, for his MA show at the Royal Academy, Abad commissioned a copy of the kitschy portrait, versions of which he has shown numerous times since. In 2016 however, after the newly elected Duterte declared that Ferdinand’s body should be moved to Manila’s Heroes’ Cemetery, Abad exhibited the work at a museum in Manila blacked out in paint. “The time for whimsy has long gone,” he says. “The election of Duterte was an incredibly harrowing experience.” For Abad, the election of a man whose “war on drugs” is estimated to have killed tens of thousands of Filipinos was a personal as well as a national disaster. “I lost my mum in 2017,” he explains. “I always thought the nation’s cancer became her own. I now talk of The Collection of Jane Ryan and William Saunders in terms of spectres. Of how the spectre of political violence in my country became intertwined with incredible personal loss.” The Collection of Jane Ryan and William Saunders can be viewed here",Arts/Art and design,‘One diamond could have bought two airports’ – the Filipino recreating Imelda Marcos’s gems stash,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/01/pio-abad-imelda-marcos-jewellery-philippines-stash-gems-plundering-filipino
3/2/2022,"Let me begin this column – loosely themed Men of the Home Front – by observing that only Matt Hancock could opt to relaunch his political career at this precise moment. Yesterday the former health secretary made news landfall with an appearance on a podcast hosted by someone from Dragons’ Den, in which he discussed the prevailing issue of our time: Matt Hancock’s romantic life. Donning the polo neck of contrition – last seen on Dapper Laughs for a Newsnight appearance in 2014 – Hancock explained he had had to break his own coronavirus guidance because he “fell in love”. Of the female aide in question, he explained: “We spent a lot of time together, ironically trying to get me to communicate in a more emotionally intelligent way.” Thank you, Alanis – although, it actually HAS ended up being quite ironic. All that incredible work on his emotional intelligence and Matt still ends up saying it out loud on a day otherwise dominated by grotesque pictures of war and human carnage from Ukraine. Then again, perhaps Matt has quite accidentally performed a valuable public service. He has selflessly redeployed as a pressure valve, providing a useful outlet for all the adult Brits who have been just itching for a chance to stride on to this or that platform and utter the words: “FOR GOD’S SAKE DON’T YOU KNOW THERE’S A WAR ON?” The answer is that yes, of course he does. (We have to keep podcasting though – it’s what separates us from the barbarians.) Indeed, perhaps mindful that this prerecorded appearance might clash unflatteringly with Events, Matt was outside the Russian embassy in London last weekend – a visit recorded somewhat idiosyncratically by his Twitter account. I say “idiosyncratically”, because outside the Russian embassy these days, most people currently photograph what they find there: the graffiti, the crowds, the ever-growing number of signs and banners. Yet the image posted to Matt’s account – perhaps taken by his emotional intelligence coach – showed Matt himself, talking intently to protesters, much in the manner of the Queen Mother visiting the East End during the blitz. Which is hugely emotionally intelligent from a guy who is, after all, just another random member of the public like them. Still, what a difference six weeks makes. In January, Hancock’s decision to stage an early morning swim in the icy Serpentine resulted in people dismissively comparing him to Vladimir Putin. My sadly unrealisable dream is that all this ends in a way in which people dismissively compare Putin to Matt Hancock. Hancock has yet to demand that Nato enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine “because we’ve all fallen in love with the country” – but on this form, who’d rule it out? In any case, there are plenty of other men of the home front who are demanding this act of war against Russia. Just as there are plenty who never stop shouting, yet somehow imagine themselves not listened to. Take George Galloway – please – who’d like you to know he was right again. As he puts it: “Me Farage Hitchens Carlson and Rod Liddle are a pretty broad front of people who think Nato expansion to the borders of #Russia was a pretty bad idea. Maybe pause and think about that?” I know what he means. Me and the three Spider-Men I‘m pointing at are a pretty broad front too. We actually bonded when we divorced our MJs and they turned the Spideykids against us. Meanwhile, Farage himself has performed a 180-degree pivot to demanding things like: “Why is Biden not in Europe taking the lead?”, which is a fairly selective form of rectitude for a man who spent years praising the way Putin operated. Poignantly, Nigel’s obsession with wars never quite runs to understanding which side he’d have been on in them. His ability to form alliances with far-right German parties at the same time as twatting on about Winston Churchill, for instance, indicates a truly remarkable flexibility. I’m sure Nigel’s bitterest regret is that he’s not quite flexible and sprightly enough to rock up at the Ukrainian embassy and offer to fight, as some British guys are now doing. I know you have to say “I admire the bravery”. But reading about one man with no military experience who hadn’t even told his family he was off to Ukraine – he has children – we might instead point to the defence secretary’s caution against this kind of action. Be it online or in real life, the alarm bells toll most heavily when you get the feeling that the person in question finds war – or rather their idea of it – somehow exhilarating. Perhaps it was always like this, and it’s just easier to see now half the world posts their inner monologue. But there seems to be such a fine line between virility and virality. Was the second world war saddled with politicians like Michael Fabricant, who yesterday announced that RAF Brize Norton, which is in Oxfordshire, “is indeed the frontline”? Because really, it isn’t. That’s not the war. War is the bloodied woman in Mariupol holding a pink bobble hat, frozen in the camera’s gaze as a shrapnel-filled small girl dies in the ambulance behind her. War is some hatchet-faced Kremlin general informing military families that the government will pay them 11,000 rubles for their dead sons. That’s £80 quid now, less tomorrow. War is people who this time a week ago were out in Kyiv’s shops, now making molotov cocktails with their children. And yes, war can elevate the most ordinary people to do the most extraordinary things. We want heroes, we need heroes – and Volodymyr Zelenskiy and so many Ukrainians have given us them. What we have less need of is performances on the home front. Chaps, with the best will in the world, this one really isn’t about you.

3/2/2022,"A proposed BBC news report that the government is trying to block concerns an allegation that a named MI5 agent with “dangerous, extremist and misogynist beliefs” used his status to abuse, control and coerce a former partner, the high court has heard. The attorney general, Suella Braverman, is seeking an injunction to prevent the BBC publishing its report, alleging breach of confidence and a breach of the agent’s rights, including his right to life, under the European convention on human rights (ECHR). The BBC contends that publication is in the public interest as the agent poses a threat to other women and that the effect of granting Braverman’s application would amount to “censorship” and give the government editorial control that would be “repugnant” to any media defendant. Due to national security concerns, the case is being held partly in private. In written – partially redacted – submissions, provided for the public part of the hearing on Tuesday, details of the proposed story were set out as follows: “The BBC wants to broadcast a programme about an individual ‘X’. The programme is to include the allegations that X is a dangerous extremist and misogynist who physically and psychologically abused two former partners; that X is also a covert human intelligence source (CHIS) … for the Security Service (‘MI5’); that X told one of these women that he worked for MI5 in order to terrorise and control her; and that MI5 should have known about X’s behaviour and realised that it was inappropriate to use him as a CHIS.” In his written submissions, Adam Wolanski QC, for the BBC, said the woman, known as “Beth”, to whom the agent disclosed his identity as a CHIS, was subjected to “undeniable violent abuse by X”, which she filmed and which he invited the court to view. In his written skeleton argument, Sir James Eadie QC, representing Braverman, said: “Publication of the report would constitute a breach of confidence/false confidence by the BBC. To do so would damage national security and the public interest. It would also create a real and immediate risk of serious or life-threatening harm to X. Those impacts establish the most powerful public interest in restraining the publication. There is no public interest in publication that could be said to override such interests.” He said that the most serious allegations of wrongdoing by X had been investigated by the police and “no criminal action was considered appropriate to be taken”. He also said there were avenues for complaint and investigation set up in domestic law to challenge MI5’s behaviour “precisely to avoid the sort of damage to the public interest that the BBC’s proposed report would produce”. The government is relying on articles 2, 3 and 8 of the ECHR. They relate, respectively, to: right to life; prohibition of torture/inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; and right to respect for private and family life. The BBC is relying on article 10, which confers the right to freedom of expression. Wolanski told the court: “Beth and Ruth, two women who do not know one another, have independently explained their strong and genuine belief that X presents a danger to other women and must be publicly named to prevent future harm. Beth and Ruth have an intimate insight into X’s psyche and behaviour, making them uniquely placed to evaluate the risk that he poses to other women.” In a statement, Ruth said she considered X “dangerous enough to kill a woman”. The hearing, which is expected to last two days, concerns Braverman’s application for an interim injunction preventing the proposed news report being published “until trial or further order”.",News/UK news,"BBC spy report alleges MI5 undercover agent abused women, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/01/bbc-spy-report-alleges-mi5-undercover-agent-abused-women-court-hears
3/2/2022,"UK manufacturers are facing a sharp rise in costs as the Russian invasion of Ukraine undermines the progress made towards fixing global supply chains before the conflict broke out, economists have warned. Factory production jumped in February amid rising domestic demand, fewer raw material shortages and easing global supply chain pressures, according to the latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips). In a sign the worst of the disruption caused by the pandemic could have peaked, companies said the number of delivery delays fell last month to the lowest since November 2020. However, experts said the conflict in Ukraine – which has triggered a surge in oil and gas prices, as well as renewed supply chain disruption – would hit firms across Europe and drag down industrial production over the coming months. Mike Thornton, the head of manufacturing at the accountancy firm RSM, said: “As the Russia-Ukraine conflict unfolds, UK manufacturers should brace for some additional headwinds. The surge in energy prices is the most obvious for heavy industry.” Russia is the world’s largest exporter of natural gas and among the top suppliers of crude oil, commodities such as wheat, and metals including palladium, platinum, gold and aluminium. “The recent shortages of components, such as microchips, could continue and expand into other areas as sanctions and export restrictions limit supply that feed into the wider supply chain,” Thornton added. Soaring energy costs and supply chain disruption caused by Covid have driven inflation to the highest levels in three decades. Analysts had hoped the cost-of-living squeeze would fade as pandemic restrictions are removed, although now warn the Russian invasion and western sanctions will add to inflationary pressures. Although Russia accounts for a relatively small share of the global trade in goods, rising energy prices are expected to further push up factory costs after issues caused by Covid-19. The manufacturing trade body Make UK said about 3,800 firms exported goods to Russia while 1,200 brought in materials, despite only accounting for 0.8% of total UK goods exports and 2.1% of imports. As well as driving up costs for energy intensive companies, western sanctions on Russia could hit the availability of materials used in the aerospace, automotive and electronics industries. The country is a major producer of metals such as titanium, nickel, cobalt and lithium. Make UK said: “Any trade disruptions will be financially unwelcome at a time when many firms are recovering from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the reductions in international trade that followed the UK’s exit from the EU.” According to the latest snapshot from IHS Markit/Cips, factory output and new orders rose last month, reflecting stronger domestic demand, new customer wins, looser Covid restrictions and improved market conditions. The purchasing managers’ index, a gauge of manufacturing output, rose to a three-month high of 58.0 in February, up from 57.3 a month earlier. A reading above 50 separates growth from contraction. Duncan Brock, the group director at Cips, said there had been a welcome boost for manufacturers despite prices for raw materials remaining high and disruption continuing for many firms. “There were certainly several positives for the UK’s manufacturing sector in February as 64% of manufacturing businesses remained optimistic.” Brock added. “However, this success comes with a health warning as the Ukrainian crisis deepens and the potential for higher commodity prices, disruptions to supply and economic pain must be considered by businesses as they try to build resilience into their supply chains in the coming months.”",News/Business,UK manufacturers face higher costs as Ukraine crisis hits supply chains,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/01/uk-manufacturers-face-higher-costs-as-ukraine-crisis-hits-supply-chains
3/2/2022,"The European Film Academy (EFA) has issued a strongly worded condemnation of the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces, though only after prominent Ukrainian director Sergei Loznitsa resigned from the organisation in protest at its initial response to the crisis. In a statement released on 1 March, the EFA said it had “joined the massive global sanctions currently in effect against Russia and fully supports the call of the Ukrainian Film Academy to boycott Russian film. The Academy strongly condemns the war started by Russia – Ukraine’s sovereignty and territory must be respected. Putin’s actions are atrocious and totally unacceptable, and we strongly condemn them.” The statement added: “We are fully aware that several of our members are fighting with arms against the aggressor. The academy will therefore exclude Russian films from this year’s European film awards and we lend our support to each element of the boycott.” The EFA’s statement follows an open letter from Loznitsa, director of In the Fog, Donbass and State Funeral, criticising the organisation for its first reaction. In his letter, published in Screen International, Loznitsa described the EFA’s first statement, issued on Thursday, as “shameful” and “gibberish”, adding: “Is it really possible that you – humanists, human rights and dignity advocates, champions of freedom and democracy, are afraid to call a war a war, to condemn barbarity and voice your protest?” Loznitsa was reacting to a statement by EFA director Matthijs Wouter Knol, in which Knol said that “the current events and daily increase of tension has an impact on film-makers’ lives and health, morale, and creative work”, and that the EFA “will stay alert and [is] in touch with our Ukrainian members … and will support all those affected in the best way we can.” In its second statement, the EFA said: “We acknowledge that this reaction should have come at an earlier point in the past days, but our democratic processes needed to be followed… [but] working quietly behind the scenes, [we] managed to raise funds and put together support structures.”",Arts/Film,European Film Academy denounces Ukraine invasion after Sergei Loznitsa protest,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/01/european-film-academy-ukraine-invasion-russia-putin-sergei-loznitsa-protest
3/2/2022,"A massive, fast-moving cloud of ash hundreds of metres tall and several kilometres wide has swept over southern Paraguay, as storms blew debris from wildfires raging in neighbouring Argentina following two years of severe drought. The colossal bank of smog enveloped Asunción, Paraguay’s capital, late on Monday, shrouding the city and its suburbs in a thick, grey haze with the aroma of burnt vegetation. Forecasters warned residents to stay inside to avoid breathing in the smoky miasma. In the southern district of Ayolas, where fires have been blazing since early January, conditions were so dark that birds went up into the trees to roost, thinking it was night, said Ray Mendoza, a volunteer firefighter. “In a question of minutes the city fell into complete darkness,” Mendoza said. “It’s the first time in 20 to 25 years doing this that I’ve seen something like it.” An index measuring particulate matter in the air shot up from single digits to over 180, close to levels deemed “very unhealthy” by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Striking videos on social media showed the towering wall of dust and soot racing over the Paraná River from the province of Corrientes in northern Argentina – 250 kilometres (155 miles) south of Asunción – and smothering beaches, farms and highways. El fenómeno que afectó hoy a la localidad de Ayolas, Misiones, Central y otros departamentos se lo denomina ""haboob"". Las corrientes descendentes (outflow) procedentes del sistema de tormentas levantó a su paso polvo y otras partículas, como ceniza y hollín.🎥Elpequenhopark2.0 pic.twitter.com/zcQgRqNUoL Motorists were forced to turn on their headlights and pull over as visibility dropped to near-zero and darkness fell in the early afternoon. “Lord Jesus, my God,” one passenger exclaimed. A weather front of cold air from the south acted “like a broom,” explained Eduardo Dose, a Paraguayan hydrologist, scooping up soot from burnt pastures and forests as well as dust from drought-stricken wetlands. Strong winds then channelled the choking cloud up the Paraguay River and directly to the capital. Violent storms are normal for the sub-tropical region, Dose added. “But if we’re going to talk about what causes the fires, there we can talk about climate change.” Massive fires have been raging across Argentina for almost two months. Nearly a million hectares in Corrientes have been burned, an area the size of Puerto Rico or Cyprus. Blazes continue to burn in nine of Argentina’s 23 provinces. Así se desarrolló en fenómeno climatológico en gran parte de Paraguay 🇵🇾 pic.twitter.com/oZQhihyfB7 Scientists point to a once-in-a-century drought – in turn linked to the global climate crisis, the la Niña weather pattern, and rampant deforestation for soybean plantations and cattle ranches in the Amazon and beyond – as lying behind the blazes. Monoculture pine plantations have also served as highly combustible fuel for both accidental and human-made conflagrations. “Scorching summer temperatures, high winds, and dry vegetation have combined to turn parts of South America into a tinderbox,” said NASA in a report with satellite imagery of the fires in Corrientes in mid-February. The fires are decimating irreplaceable wildlife in Argentina’s vast, northeastern wetlands, killing and displacing jaguars, anteaters, capybaras, birds and amphibians. Roughly half of Parque Iberá, an ambitious rewilding project covering about 1,600 square kilometres in the far north of Corrientes close to the Paraguayan border, was lost after lightning struck the dried-out nature reserve. “It is with a heavy heart that I share the devastation that wildfires are causing in the Iberá wetlands,” tweeted Kristine Tompkins, president of Tompkins Conservation, which has created 13 national parks, including Iberá, across Chile and Argentina. With soybean and cattle products representing over a third of Argentina’s exports, the government has been slow to respond. A bill to protect the wetlands was withdrawn from congress by the progressive government of Alberto Fernández in December. Social media influencer Santi Maratea raised almost $1m to buy fire trucks and equipment for volunteer firemen in Corrientes, who are shouldering most the work. Volunteers have also been struggling to put out fires in the district of Ayolas, southern Paraguay, which contributed to the ash cloud. “We’ve had some rain in recent days but it’s not enough to put out all the fires in the area,” said Mendoza.

3/2/2022,"An energy tariff offering fixed prices for a year has sold out within hours of being publicised, after consumers rushed to try to protect themselves from the effects of the war in Ukraine on household bills. E.on’s Next Online V11 tariff promised prices fixed for a year, set at the same level as Ofgem’s new capped rate. Launched in mid-February, and only available to existing E.on customers, the deal had largely gone unnoticed until the MoneySavingExpert founder, Martin Lewis, highlighted the tariff on Monday. Within hours it was pulled from sale by E.on, such was the demand from people desperate to shield themselves from further energy price increases. Dual fuel gas and electricity bills are already set to rise more than 50% to an average of just under £2,000 per household on 1 April after the regulator, Ofgem, increased the cap on unit prices – the maximum suppliers can charge households. However, analysts have warned that the war in Ukraine could lead to a further 50% increase when the cap changes again in October, leaving households facing the prospect of paying £3,000 a year to heat and light their home. “If you’ve been offered this rate as an E.on customer you should bite its hand off and take it, as energy prices are anticipated to go up again later this year. It’s a corker,” said Lewis of the tariff on Monday. The deal was only available to existing Eon customers who paid by direct debit. An E.on spokesperson said: ”In these challenging times, we’re doing our best to offer competitive tariffs for our customers and to have them available for as long as we can. “Our tariffs have to reflect the costs we pay on the global wholesale market and we offer a number of ways we can help customers through these difficult times.” Since the start of the energy crisis last autumn, switching in the energy market has all but ceased as suppliers have collapsed and there has been no incentive for companies to try to attract new customers. Even before the events of last week, households were facing up to the prospect of high energy bills as part of the cost-of-living crisis. On Monday, the Bank of America warned UK households could suffer the biggest annual decline in their living standards since the 1950s.",Lifestyle/Money,Energy bills: E.on’s one-year fix sells out amid cost-of-living fears,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/01/energy-bills-eon-one-year-fix-money-saving-expert-martin-lewis
