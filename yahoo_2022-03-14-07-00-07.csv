3/14/2022,"Former President Barack Obama revealed Sunday afternoon that he’s tested positive for COVID-19 and is experiencing mild symptoms. “I just tested positive for COVID. I’ve had a scratchy throat for a couple days, but am feeling fine otherwise,” he tweeted. “Michelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted, and she has tested negative. It’s a reminder to get vaccinated if you haven’t already, even as cases go down.” Coronavirus cases have plummeted since January, when the Omicron variant raged across the U.S., setting records for infections. Many cities and states have since softened their COVID mitigation measures, ditching mask and vaccine mandates. Even so, more than 1,000 Americans continue to die each day from the virus, and over 30,000 people are currently hospitalized with COVID. Only 65.2 percent of the U.S. population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mask and Vaccine Mandates Are Gone, but COVID Is Still Here Nearly 965,000 Americans have died since the pandemic began in 2020, and nearly 80 million infections have been reported in the U.S. alone, the CDC reports.

3/14/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia has asked China for military equipment since its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, the Financial Times and Washington Post reported on Sunday, citing U.S. officials. U.S. National Security advisor Jake Sullivan will be in Rome on Monday to meet with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi, the White House said earlier. Russia, which calls its action in Ukraine a ""special operation,"" and China have tightened cooperation as they have come under strong Western pressure over human rights and a raft of other issues. Beijing has not condemned Russia's attack and does not call it an invasion, but has urged a negotiated solution. The White House's National Security Council declined to comment. The Washington Post said the unidentified U.S. officials did not state the kind of weaponry that had been requested or how China had responded.

3/14/2022,"Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo claims “some people” have told her that the Biden administration sees Vladimir Putin as “a partner,” not “as the enemy” – and people on social media are fighting mad about that nonsense. “I was on the phone all weekend with various people about this conflict right now,” she said on Sunday’s “Fox and Friends” when asked about Russia’s attack on Ukraine. “What I took away from all of my phone calls is the strategy of this administration has been underwhelming and not enough.” Bartiromo went on to say, “It seems that there is a predetermined outcome here in place, and that is a slow death for Ukraine and President Zelenskyy, as the Russian forces continue to inch closer. With all of these other fatalities that we’re talking about…and some people have told me over the weekend that they feel that at the end of the day this administration does not see Putin as the enemy, they see him as a partner on many issues.” Raising her voice, Bartiromo concluded, “When is this administration going to get serious in telling Vladimir Putin we are done with partnerships?” Reaction to her claim that the Biden administration is playing nice with Putin was deemed laughable by many on social media, considering the bromance that the former president she supposed, Donald Trump, had with President Putin. “This is nuts,” David Corn, the DC bureau chief of Mother Jones, tweeted. “Her man Trump sided with Putin over his own intelligence community. And Trump recently praised his moves in Ukraine as ‘genius.’ A question for medical science: How does her head not explode?” And MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle wrote, ” For every female business journalist watching this downward spiral, it’s like believing in Batman all your life & then one day realizing…he’s actually The Joker.” Here are a handful of others who are calling Bartiromo on the craziness of her comments.",Politics/The Wrap,"Maria Bartiromo Called ‘an Idiot’ for Claiming Biden Administration Sees Putin as ‘a Partner,’ ‘Not an Ememy’",https://news.yahoo.com/maria-bartiromo-called-idiot-claiming-203300505.html
3/14/2022,"Jewel, a longtime friend and business partner of Tony Hsieh, reportedly made multiple to save the tech exec. Hsieh died in a house fire in November 2020 following several months of deteriorating mental health. A new biography said that Jewel visited his home months before his death. Singer-songwriter Jewel made multiple attempts to save former Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh after a harrowing visit to his Park City, Utah home shed light on his rapidly deteriorating mental state prior to his death, according to a new biography. Hsieh's death, which had been ruled an accident from injuries sustained in a house fire, came following months of troubling behavior from the entrepreneur and rapidly declining mental health. Jewel, a longtime friend and business partner of Hsieh, was among those close to him to witness his demise. Video: Mental health experts debunk 10 stress myths Mental-health experts Stephanie Cook and Teresa Leyro debunk 10 myths about stress. They explain why everyone needs stress, including children, and why vacations can't cure burnout. They also talk about different coping methods, such as alcohol use, nail biting, and stress eating — as well as healthier alternatives to avoid their long-term effects. 

Cook is an assistant professor of biostatistics and social and behavioral sciences at the NYU School of Global Public Health. She focuses on the connection between attachment, minority stress, and health among disadvantaged individuals.

10:19 PTSD only affects soldiers and people in war zones According to a forthcoming biography of Hsieh excerpted in the Wall Street Journal — ""Happy at Any Cost, The Revolutionary Vision and Fatal Quest of Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh"" by Kirsten Grind and Katherine Sayre — Jewel visited his mansion in August 2020, where he had been hosting a rotating roster of high-profile guests. When she arrived, she found it in complete disarray, covered in dog feces and wax from hundreds of burning candles left around the house, as sinks and showers ran continuously, according to the report. The singer reportedly found Hsieh in the backyard, emaciated and sitting in a chair in his underwear surrounded by canisters of nitrous oxide, which he had been openly abusing at the time. According to the Journal, he then presented her with a box where he had written a series of unintelligible numbers he said was ""the algorithm for world peace."" Jewel — who had previously worked with Hsieh to develop a mental health program for Zappos employees — learned that Hsieh had also stopped sleeping and claimed he had ""hacked"" the ability to need it. Concerned, she spoke with Hsieh's staff and head of security, who claimed had been following orders to leave the tech exec and his home in its state. ""If he kills himself and everyone else in there from a huge fire, you can't say you weren't warned,"" Jewel told the security officer, according to the biography. The new details come after a December 2020 Forbes report found Jewel had sent Hsieh a letter via FedEx shortly after leaving Park City that August. ""I am going to be blunt,"" she wrote in the letter, which was reviewed by Forbes. ""I need to tell you that I don't think you are well and in your right mind. I think you are taking too many drugs that cause you to disassociate."" She continued: ""The people you are surrounding yourself with are either ignorant or willing to be complicit in you killing yourself."" Hsieh would later die a few months later from injuries sustained in a house fire in Connecticut in November 2020, after he was either trapped or barricaded in the basement. Though his death was ruled an accident, the details around it still remain under investigation.

3/14/2022,"Vladimir Putin, a 20th century tyrant fighting a 21st century war, had been hailed in virtually every corner of the globe as a master tactician and brilliant communicator, a technological and cultural eminence for whom no nation in his sphere of influence can be any sort of match. But after being gobsmacked by Ukraine and the planet at large, it’s becoming apparent that old guys are bad at war, because too much of the world has passed them by. Maybe he’s been too busy reading his own press clippings, but even basic logistics, the very fundamental building block of war, have failed in most embarrassing ways. In the Civil War we praised our generals, but some of the bigger heroes were the ones responsible for delivering freight cars of hay to hungry warhorses. By contrast, the infamous Russian convoy that was supposed to crush Kyiv like a bug, couldn’t even feed or fuel itself — a mistake worthy of the 16th century. And speaking of the past, Putin seems to have fixated on Chechnya, Crimea and Aleppo, sites of Russian barbarism, where he nevertheless controlled the narrative and blunted world criticism. But in the world of communications, six years is forever. Russia had no idea how crisply and immediately the lines would be drawn. In short, the master of propaganda got out-propagandaed. No doubt, some of the heroic and optimistic electronic dispatches coming from Ukraine were, and are, false, but that’s hardly the point. Ukraine set the tone and the narrative early, beating Putin to the punch in a war that in some ways is being fought as much with cellphones as artillery. Putin’s knowledge of technology didn’t seem to account for universally available apps that can allow anyone anywhere to track aircraft or view satellite imagery of the battlefield — an advancement that not only turned the Russian convoy into a laughingstock, but also made sitting ducks of tanks and bolstered Ukrainian morale in the war’s critical early days. Nor did Putin seem to understand that he and the Chinese weren’t the only people on this planet with hacking skills. This is the way aging autocrats think: The fact that other nations don’t hack must mean they don’t know how. It would never occur to an autocrat like Putin that morals, law and decency — not a lack of ability — are what keep the civilized countries of this world from hacking into competing governments and corporations. So when Putin launched his shells, the most immediate effect was the explosion of Russian websites, taken down by those who, until now, had no reason and better manners than to have done so previously. Putin’s lack of counter-hacking has been a mystery to date. This is still possible and perhaps likely. But the delay might indicate that he has suddenly been made to understand that Russia’s own vulnerabilities are far greater than he thought — and his own techies are now spending their time playing defense. Perhaps the most foolish thing Putin did was believe the fake news coming from Fox, Facebook and the entire right-wing drumbeat of lies that he himself helped to create. He believed President Joe Biden to be weak, just as Fox told him, a doddering and mentally slipping old man incapable of putting up a fight. It was assumed Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham would make effective spokespeople, that all they needed to do was tell their audiences that Putin was a good guy and American opinion would coalesce around the Russians. He honestly seems to have believed that he and his American allies had so eroded American civility and resolve that we would react meekly, if at all, to Russian atrocities. But to dismiss the durability of American values, both of the people and the president, was a sloppy mistake. A decade older than Putin, Biden nevertheless showed the characteristic flexibility that gives democracies an advantage over autocracies. Typically, nations sit on their intelligence like a mother hen; this time, we broadcast to the world everything we knew well in advance, exposing plans for false flag operations and other Russian tricks, knocking the despot off his game early. And devastatingly, Putin failed to realize that modern technology could make the ruble worthless, almost like flipping a switch. His renowned “economic fortress” crumbled because he bet stacks of gold bars, a great asset in 1830, could protect him against a day when money is more represented by electrons than doubloons. Of course a cornered savage is a dangerous savage. The world right now could use a little vintage Putin craftiness and doublespeak that will allow him a face-saving exit from the catastrophe of his own creation. But for that to happen he will need to stop living in the past. Tim Rowland is a Herald-Mail columnist.
