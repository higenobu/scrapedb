2/8/2022,"At least 28 people have taken up New Zealand’s euthanasia services since the country legalised the practice three months ago, the news site Stuff has reported. The country’s End of Life Choice Act came into force in November, after years of activism by euthanasia campaigners and being ratified by referendum. Sixty-five per cent of voting-age New Zealanders voted in favour of legalising assisted dying, joining just a handful of countries that allow it.  At the time the process was legalised, New Zealand officials were uncertain how many people would take it up. In written statements, the ministry of health has said “the number of people that may seek assisted dying is expected to be small”. They noted that in comparable overseas locations where assisted dying was legal, it made up between 0.3% and 2% of all deaths. Due to New Zealand’s relatively strict criteria, they also expected almost two-thirds of applications to be turned down. “Based on overseas experiences, the ministry estimates up to 950 people could apply for assisted dying each year, with up to 350 being assisted to die,” they said. In some countries, the number of people taking up euthanasia services started slowly and soared over time. ​​ Figures from Switzerland, for example, have shown that the numbers of people who underwent assisted suicide rose steadily year-on-year, from 187 in 2003 to 965 in 2015. In the Netherlands, which has some of the most liberal euthanasia and assisted suicide laws, they make up 4.4% of the total number of deaths. According to the 2017 Regional Euthanasia Review Committees, there were 6,585 cases of voluntary euthanasia or assisted suicide that year. To be eligible for assisted dying services in New Zealand, patients must meet a series of strict criteria, assessed by two doctors. They must be a New Zealander, over 18 years of age, have a terminal illness likely to end their life within six months, be experiencing “unbearable suffering that cannot be relieved”, be competent to make the decision, and be experiencing advanced stages of irreversible decline in their physical ability. Health practitioners can also opt out of providing the service. Other countries where euthanasia is legal include Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada and Colombia.",News/World news,At least 28 people take advantage of New Zealand assisted dying laws in first three months,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/at-least-28-people-take-advantage-of-new-zealand-assisted-dying-laws-in-first-three-months
2/8/2022,"The Morrison government’s demand that the ABC and SBS add a new layer of accountability has been blasted by Labor as “regulation by stealth” that could lead to a loss of independence. At the same time as the Coalition pledged to restore ABC funding to 2018 levels on Monday, the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, unveiled a plan to impose new reporting conditions on both public broadcasters.  The so-called statements of expectations will be on top of the broadcasters’ already rigorous reporting requirements to parliament. The government will restore ABC funding to 2018 levels, when Malcolm Turnbull imposed an $84m indexation pause, but the pledge will not make up for the $526m cut from the ABC budget since the Coalition came to power. Labor’s media spokesperson, Michelle Rowland, warned the accountability plan is a slippery slope which could lead to a loss of independence; and questioned whether the regulatory frameworks for the ABC and SBS support such a demand. “Make no mistake, minister Fletcher’s ‘statement of expectations’ requiring additional regional reporting is a form of regulation by stealth, and the notion the national broadcasters should comply with this minister’s expectations as a quid pro quo for funding is wholly unacceptable,” Rowland told Guardian Australia. Fletcher has written to the ABC board chair, Ita Buttrose, saying he expects the broadcaster to detail key activities every year including staffing levels and editorial outputs in regional and rural areas, how it spends the news budget and levels of Australian content. The ABC has declined demands to report levels of content separately as the ABC Charter already ensures it meets the requirements for telling Australian stories. “It is my expectation as minister that, for improved transparency, the ABC will report on the following metrics in its future annual reports,” Fletcher said in his letter. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokesperson for the ABC confirmed the board had received the letter. “The minister has written to the chair about the Statement of Expectations,” he said. “The Statement will be considered by the Board in due course.” Labor is planning to ask the government to explain why it believes it has the power to impose the new conditions at Senate estimates next week. “The national broadcasters are key democratic and cultural institutions whose independence is enshrined in legislation, and funding stability is an important guard against political interference,” Rowland said. “It is, therefore, concerning that the minister has issued ‘Statements of Expectations’ that the ABC and SBS undertake a new reporting function, given the minister is not empowered to issue Statements of Expectations to the national broadcasters.

In his letter setting out the scheme Fletcher said he “continues to recognise and respect the ABC’s statutory independence and the legislative requirement that it perform its functions free from government interference or direction”. “Nothing in this letter is to be taken as a direction issued to the ABC by or on behalf of the Government,” he said. Guardian Australia understands apart from specific and limited circumstances the ABC Act is expressly not subject to direction by or on behalf of the government. There is nothing in the act which details the concept of a ministerial statement of expectations. “The decision on whether to provide additional reporting is entirely a matter for the ABC and SBS, who already provide transparency in a range of ways,” Rowland said. “While Labor has no issue with transparency and reporting in principle, we note it may be used as an avenue for political interference in the national broadcasters, in certain circumstances, and we reject this Minister’s governance invention.” The Coalition has cut $526m from the ABC since its first budget, including an “indexation pause” for the past three years which Fletcher denies is a cut. A poll of 1,000 voters conducted by the Australia Institute found that 52% want the $84m cut from the ABC in the last three years to be restored, more than double those who oppose it (25%).",News/Media,"Coalition’s new ABC and SBS accountability measures could weaken independence, Labor warns",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/08/coalitions-new-abc-and-sbs-accountability-measures-could-weaken-independence-labor-warns
2/8/2022,"The beloved Heeler family home from the hit Australian children’s TV series Bluey has been recreated in real life and will be made available to stay in for one weekend. Brisbane, the city which inspired the show’s colourful animated backdrop, is home to the replica of the Heeler’s home, featuring details such as the red letterbox and Bluey’s toys.  The global phenomenon follows the adventures of Bluey – a loveable, inexhaustible six-year-old Blue Heeler dog – who lives with her mum Chilli, dad Bandit and little sister Bingo. Nestled on a quiet, tree-lined street in one of Brisbane’s most picturesque neighbourhoods, the house is a collaboration between Airbnb and BBC studios and took two years to build. Despite the effort involved, it will be available to rent for only one weekend later this month. “The Heeler house is almost a character in its own right,” said Madeleine Jelfs, Bluey senior marketing manager, BBC Studios Australia and New Zealand. “We’ve been amazed at the outpouring of love the fans have shown for this iconic setting, and for all the beautiful Queensland locations the crew have so lovingly included across the three series. “Bringing Bluey’s backdrop to life in such an ingenious and colourful way for our fans has been an absolute delight.” Not just beloved by kids, the house on the show has become a talking point among parents, who have questioned how it is that Bluey’s parents – who work as an airport security guard and an archeologist – could afford the home, which is estimated to cost more than $1m in real life. Last year comedian Zach Mander went so far as to suggest Bluey’s parents had paid for their house through involvement in the drug trade. “The median pay for both these jobs in Australia is $67,000 and $22 an hour respectively,” he said in a video. “There is no way the bank is approving them for a mortgage on a million-plus home. “It seems to me that Bluey’s parents could be up to some nefarious activities.” Staying in the house will be a lot cheaper. This two-night stay, for one family of four, will take place from Friday February 18 to Sunday February 20 and cost AU$20. Airbnb says booking will open 15 February and it will go to whoever gets in first. Guests will spot some familiar features like the red letterbox, bone-shaped chimney and bay window. Inside, the girls’ playroom has a rainbow canopy, kiwi rug and numerous toys – including Bluey’s beloved Chattermax and magic xylophone. Kids can stay overnight in Bluey and Bingo’s bedroom, equipped with two single beds fitted with a stained-glass window feature, hanging lanterns, cloud cushions and, of course, a watermelon rug. “Like many parents with young children, I’ve been captivated by the adventures of Bluey and her family, which bring so much joy and quintessential Aussie humour to audiences across the globe,” said Susan Wheeldon, Airbnb manager for Australia and New Zealand. “There will be nothing quite like waking up in the Heeler house and getting to live and breathe in Bluey’s magical world for one wondrous weekend.” At this stage, there is no plan to make the house a permanent stay on Airbnb but Wheeldon said “never say never”.

2/8/2022,"Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, has welcomed plans to reopen Australia’s border but warned travellers may need a third Covid-19 vaccine dose in order to move freely about the state. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Monday announced the nation would open on 21 February to all visa holders, including tourists, who had received two doses of a vaccine.  The border’s reopening was praised by Andrews, who on Tuesday said it was “good for the economy, good for jobs”. “The fact that being vaccinated remains a requirement … that’s obviously a really, really good outcome and it’s about getting back to normal as best we can be in the midst of a global pandemic,” he told reporters. But international travellers with only two doses of a vaccine could face the prospect of being able to travel into Victoria but not access hospitality, retail and other services. National cabinet is still awaiting advice from Australia’s independent expert group on vaccination, Atagi, on whether it will change the definition of fully vaccinated to mean three doses of a Covid vaccine. Andrews has been lobbying for the change for some time and has already mandated the third dose for workers in health and aged care, disability, emergency services, corrections, quarantine accommodation, food distribution and education. When Morrison was asked on Monday if incoming travellers would ever need three doses to be considered fully vaccinated, even if the definition changed domestically, he replied: “No.” “It will be two [doses]. There are various arguments around the world for three doses. Two doses is what the chief medical officer says is sufficient,” he said. However, Andrews suggested that if the advice from Atagi was to change, so should the federal government’s position. “I’m sure the commonwealth government will reserve the right to change its view based on advice that comes from experts,” he said. “They (Atagi) must be getting very close to making that decision. We’ve got a national cabinet meeting on Thursday. Hopefully we can receive it before then or at that meeting. “All the international evidence, all the advice I get from our team is that three doses is what’s required in order to be as safe as it can be.” Andrews has consistently said if Atagi changes its definition of fully vaccinated, the Victorian government will also extend its vaccinated economy. Currently, people must have proof of two vaccine doses or a valid medical exemption to be able to attend hospitality venues and events in Victoria, as well as some retail, including hairdressers and beauty salons. Asked if the vaccinated economy would applied to international travellers, Andrews replied: “It will apply here in the state of Victoria.” “As far as those who get into the country, and the circumstances in which they get into the country, I think we’ve well established that is a matter for the commonwealth,” he said. Almost 46% of Victorians aged 18 and over have had three doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 93% aged 12 and over have had two doses. Almost 50%of Victorians between five and 11 have had one dose. Victoria’s opposition leader, Matthew Guy, said mandating two vaccine doses was “enough”. “We can’t conduct 2022 like it’s 2020 or 2021. We’ve got to move on,” he said.",News/Australia news,Daniel Andrews at odds with Scott Morrison over third vaccine dose for international travellers,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/daniel-andrews-at-odds-with-scott-morrison-over-third-vaccine-dose-for-international-travellers
