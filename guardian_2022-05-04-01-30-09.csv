5/4/2022,"This was the night the Met Gala brought Marilyn Monroe back from the dead. If any lingering doubts remained about the power of the night as a force in American popular culture, they were silenced when Kim Kardashian stepped on to the red carpet wearing the very dress Monroe wore to sing Happy Birthday to JFK in 1962. Unworn for the intervening 60 years, the dress was fashion as holy relic, fashion as green-screen magic, fashion as skin-to-skin contact between screen goddesses from two very different centuries.Reports of the demise of dressing up have turned out to be greatly exaggerated. The Met Gala is fashion’s biggest night of the year. Returning to the traditional first-Monday-in-May slot on the social calendar for the first time in three years, this year’s party made it abundantly clear that the fashion world is not remotely chastened, dimmed or otherwise humbled by the pandemic. From Katy Perry as a hamburger to Rihanna as the pope, the party has given us the most unforgettable celebrity looks of the past decade, and this year’s event showed no sign of slowing down. Modern party dressing, trailblazed by the Met, is dressing up as fancy dress rather than dressing up as an aspiration to elegance. Fashion’s biggest night of the year is now entirely about looking spectacular, rather than stylish. Kylie Jenner and Nicki Minaj both wore baseball caps: white and worn backwards with a veil to complement Jenner’s Off White wedding dress; in black leather to match the leggings worn by Nicki Minaj. Jessie Buckley, in a Schiaparelli suit, wore a fake moustache. Gigi Hadid wore a burgundy latex bodysuit under a vast puffer jacket. Gucci designer Alessandro Michele and Jared Leto came as identical twins, down to their red satin bow ties and crystal hair barrettes. Irina Shayk wore a black leather biker jacket, and Gwen Stefani chose a lime-green bra top.Chic is dead, and social media has blown good taste out of the water. Much is made of the ultra-exclusive invite list of the Met Gala, where each golden ticket comes at a price of £28,000, but what happens inside the party is entirely beside the point. The real party happens on Instagram, and everyone is invited. Kim Kardashian’s 300 million followers saw her in Marilyn’s dress before her table mates did. “I miss the days when people just wore beautiful clothes,” laments Tom Ford in Anna, Amy Odell’s new biography of Anna Wintour. Wintour, the queen of the Met Gala, oversees the night from a vantage point at the top of the steps outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, acknowledging the crowds with an occasional wave as if from the Buckingham Palace balcony. Ford, who attended Monday-night’s party in classic evening dress complete with white tie and a white carnation buttonhole, complains that the Met has “turned into a costume party … [it] used to be very chic people wearing beautiful clothes going to an exhibition about the 18th century. You didn’t have to look like the 18th century, you didn’t have to dress like a hamburger, you didn’t have to arrive in a van, where you were standing up because you couldn’t sit down because you wore a chandelier.”The Met has blasted an arcane and elitist old world order out of the water. Where once the pecking order at New York’s elite charity events was determined by who had the most dazzling tiara in their family vault, the iconography of the modern Met Gala is entirely democratic. The references are to pop culture. There are hamburgers, as per Ford’s thinly veiled swipe at Katy Perry; Marilyn Monroe, reincarnated by Kim Kardashian, the Statue of Liberty, channelled by Blake Lively in a dress that changed colour from copper to blue as she walked up the steps; the Manhattan skyline, as mapped out in crystals on Alicia Keys’ Ralph Lauren cape. These are references that belong to everyone. But the new world order comes with toxic hierarchies of its own. Beneath the Halloween-adjacent silliness, the pursuit of impossible levels of physical perfection is a deadly serious business. Kim Kardashian revealed that because Monroe’s dress was a historical artefact and could not be altered, she lost 16lbs in three weeks to fit into it. Cara Delevingne, taking the dress code of Gilded Glamour literally, removed the top half of her Dior morning suit on the red carpet to reveal nothing but gold body paint with matching nipple covers. Emily Ratajkowski, similarly, chose vintage Versace, first seen on the catwalk in 1992, made entirely of beads and chains above the waist, without even a wisp of fabric. The approval of the arbiters of good taste has been replaced by social media’s rapacious appetite for bare flesh. This is a new world order, for sure; whether it represents progress is up for debate. But while all around played the red carpet for maximum laughs, one supermodel flew the flag for quietly subversive British style. In a floor-length black gown by Burberry, accessorised with old-school understatement, with sheer black tights, heeled sandals and a red lip, Kate Moss – once the naughtiest girl in fashion, who once scandalised the nation by wearing a Topshop dress to the Met Gala – did what few now dare to do, and wore a little black dress.

5/4/2022,"A teenager said to have lionised Hitler and who allegedly believed he was part of a race war against “totalitarian” liberal democracy has gone on trial accused of preparing to commit a terrorist act. Luke Skelton, 18, is alleged to have carried out “hostile reconnaissance” of Forth Banks police station in Newcastle upon Tyne. Skelton denies preparing to commit acts of terrorism while a college student studying a BTec in information technology. The prosecuting barrister, Nicholas de la Poer QC, told a jury at Teesside crown court on Tuesday there was evidence that Skelton conducted internet research into three police stations in Newcastle, physically going to one where he took photographs. “These were not the snaps of a tourist marvelling at the architecture. The prosecution’s case is that there was a much more sinister purpose to what Luke Skelton was doing that day.” De la Poer said Skelton went because “he had a plan. His plan was to commit terrorist acts.” Skelton travelled the 10 miles from his home in Washington, Tyne and Wear, to carry out “hostile reconnaissance” on the police station, the prosecutor said. He said there was evidence that Skelton believed in an extreme rightwing ideology that was racist, sexist, antisemitic and Islamophobic. Skelton lionised Hitler and approved of the attack by the white supremacist Brenton Tarrant on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in which 51 people were killed, De la Poer said. De la Poer said Skelton was not in the dock for merely holding those views but “as a result of those views, the prosecution say, he decided to act, he began to prepare”. The prosecution said the jury would see copies of notes, messages and a “draft manifesto” prepared by Skelton. One note, it was said, echoed key elements of a manifesto written and sent by Anders Breivik, the far-right Norwegian terrorist who killed 77 people in 2011. “It is clear, we submit, that Luke Skelton regards himself as engaged in a race war,” said the prosecutor. “The note is clearly intended to be read after Luke Skelton has done something. He states that the purpose of the final note is to clarify the reasoning for why I’ve committed these acts to accelerate the coming collapse and racial war. It is expected by Luke Skelton that the war will lead to people dying in their thousands. “The hope, he is expressing, is that his act will be the spark for that war.” Another note written in 2019, the jury heard, showed Skelton’s view was that “21st-century Britain is a totalitarian state and that he harks back to an era where things were better. Namely 1900.” That was a time, De la Poer said, when the racial profile of the country was less diverse, women could not vote and Britain was a powerful empire. Internet searches Skelton is alleged to have made included how to make dynamite and how to make napalm. Skelton was said to have downloaded material that glorified the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Another downloaded video, titled Jewbusters, had footage of Hitler with music from the film Ghostbusters. The jury will hear evidence of threatening messages he sent on the Discord social media platform. In one he posted a link to a drag queen show and said “I got a fucking target”. De la Poer said the prosecution was not arguing Skelton was definitely intending to attack the drag queen. Instead “it was something that he said he was going to do. Then he said he wouldn’t do it as it was something he had said openly on Discord.” Skelton was referred by the safeguarding lead at his college to the Prevent programme, aimed at deradicalising people. The court heard Skelton had eight sessions before he turned 18 and disengaged from the service.

5/4/2022,"The stunning revelation that the US supreme court has privately voted to overturn Roe v Wade immediately thrust one of the most polarizing issues in American life to the forefront of the national political debate, and now abortion rights promises to reshape the dynamics of the coming midterm elections. The draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito and obtained by Politico in a highly unusual and possibly unprecedented leak from the nation’s highest court, would strike down Roe, the landmark supreme court decision that has guaranteed access to abortion for nearly half a century, and a subsequent 1992 decision – Planned Parenthood v Casey – that largely upheld that right. “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” Alito wrote in the draft opinion labeled “first draft”, which was not expected to be finalized for at least several more weeks and could change in its final form. The question of whether abortion should be legal, Alito argues, is best answered by individual states. In a statement on Tuesday, the supreme court confirmed the authenticity of the draft report but cautioned that it “does not represent a decision by the court or the final position of any member on the issues in the case”. Nevertheless, as the revelation reverberated across Washington, protesters gathered in front of the supreme court on Tuesday morning, shouting loudly enough to be heard by the members of Congress arriving for work at the Capitol. From the White House, Joe Biden urged voters to elect political leaders who would act to protect abortion access and reproductive rights, irrespective of the supreme court’s final decision. “If the court does overturn Roe, it will fall on our nation’s elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman’s right to choose,” Biden said in a statement. “And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November. At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law.” Strategists were preparing for a decision that either weakened or reversed Roe, but the leak upended the expected timetable and, potentially, the legislative agenda. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said he would bring legislation to the floor that would codify abortion access in federal law. But the measure is unlikely to garner the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate. A similar measure passed by the Democratic-controlled House last year does not even have the support of all 50 Democratic senators. “A vote on this legislation is not an abstract exercise. This is as urgent and real as it gets,” Schumer said on the Senate floor on Tuesday. “We will vote to protect a woman’s right to choose and every American is going to see which side every senator stands.” In anticipation of such a ruling by the supreme court, Republican-led states have proposed, and in many cases already passed, a cascade of restrictive anti-abortion laws. Conservative activists are pushing a nationwide ban on abortion if Republicans recapture control of Congress in November, as they are favored to do. In a flurry of statements and fundraising emails, Democrats argued that the erosion of reproductive rights was a reason to support them in the November midterms. “Republicans just gutted Roe v Wade, the Constitution’s guarantee of reproductive freedom, and will ban abortion in all 50 states, if they take over Congress,” New York congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, wrote on Twitter. “Only Democrats will protect our freedoms. That is now the central choice in the 2022 election.” Democratic lawmakers and candidates condemned the expected decision, and vowed to protect access to abortion. “As a pro-choice pastor, I’ve always believed that a patient’s room is way too small for a woman, her doctor, and the United States government,” wrote Georgia senator Raphael Warnock, one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election this cycle. “I’ll always fight to protect a woman’s right to choose. And that will never change.” Minnesota senator Tina Smith put it more bluntly: “This is bullshit.” Republicans, while supportive of the draft opinion, largely focused on the leak, expressing outrage over the disclosure that was likely to further undermine faith in the judiciary as an independent branch of government. “Last night’s stunning breach was an attack on the independence of the supreme court,” Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell wrote in a statement. “By every indication, this was yet another escalation in the radical left’s ongoing campaign to bully and intimidate federal judges and substitute mob rule for the rule of law.” Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement that he had ordered the marshal of the court to open an investigation into the source of the leak. “This was a singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the court and the community of public servants who work here,” he said. Gauging public opinion on abortion is notoriously difficult. But polls have consistently found that most Americans want Roe to remain the law of the land, and the vast majority want abortion to remain legal in at least some cases. A decision overturning Roe would be the culmination of a 50-year project by anti-abortion activists to remake the federal courts by using their political clout to pressure Republicans to appoint and confirm reliably conservative majorities. In 2016, Donald Trump sealed his support among conservative justices by vowing to nominate supreme court justices who would overturn Roe. His presidency yielded three conservative justices, all of whom are reportedly in the majority voting to strike down Roe. They also refused to block a novel Texas law that has effectively outlawed abortion in the nation’s second-largest state. While the nation awaits a final opinion, pro-choice activists are urging supporters to keep making their voices heard. “Let’s be clear: this is a draft opinion. It’s outrageous, it’s unprecedented, but it is not final,” Planned Parenthood wrote on Twitter. “Abortion is your right – and it is STILL LEGAL.”",News/US news,Abortion to become key fight in US midterms after stunning court leak,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/03/abortion-midterms-election-scotus-draft-opinion
