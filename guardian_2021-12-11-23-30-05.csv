12/11/2021,"Max Verstappen claimed a vital pole position for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the best possible start to his attempt seal his first Formula One world championship. Beating title rival Lewis Hamilton into second place at the Yas Marina circuit puts him firmly on the front foot for Sunday’s showdown in the season finale.  For Verstappen the pole was first blood in this vital weekend and may well prove crucial to his world championship hopes. Passing and indeed racing itself has been notoriously difficult at Yas Marina in the past. The circuit has been altered this year including the removal of two chicanes to be replaced with faster corners in an attempt to improve overtaking possibilities but how successful they have been remains to be seen. If Verstappen can hold his lead on the short run into and through turn one, he will have every chance of converting it to the victory, while if Hamilton is to take the title he knows he will have to pass his rival on track. Lando Norris was a superb third for McLaren, Red Bull’s Sergio Pérez in fourth and Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz in fifth.  Giles Richards’ full report will follow shortly.",Sport/Sport,"Max Verstappen on pole, Hamilton second, for title-deciding Abu Dhabi GP",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/11/max-verstappen-on-pole-hamilton-second-for-title-deciding-abu-dhabi-gp
12/11/2021,"Forget everything you ever thought you knew about pregnancy: a 26-year-old congressman, who will never be pregnant himself, has helpfully stepped in to explain the process to everyone. A fetus is just like a photograph, according to Madison Cawthorn, a right-wing congressman from North Carolina. During an anti-abortion speech on the House floor last week, Cawthorn proclaimed that having an abortion is like snatching a half-developed photograph of a sunset out of someone’s hand and ripping it to shreds. (You could almost see his brain working as he spoke: a photo develops … an embryo develops … wow, I am very smart!)  I’m afraid it gets worse. Having delivered this torturous analogy, Cawthorn (who has been accused of sexually harassing college classmates and once advised mothers, “if you are raising a young man, please raise them to be a monster”), then switched to religious rhetoric. “Eternal souls woven into earthen vessels sanctified by almighty God and endowed with the miracle of life are denied their birth,” Cawthorn declared grandly. Weirdly, a lot of women weren’t too keen on being described as “earthern vessels,” and Cawthorn’s remarks quickly caused online outrage. Whenever women get upset about their rights being taken away by misogynistic extremists, you can always rely on a Reasonable Man™ to swoop in and explain how everyone’s overreacting. This incident was no exception: Grayson Quay argued in the Week that the women getting angry on the internet had misunderstood the biblical passages to which Cawthorn was alluding. “[I]t seems Cawthorn, a vocal evangelical Christian, was using ‘earthen vessels’ to refer not to the mother’s body, but to the body of the unborn baby,” Quay wrote. Even if that is what Cawthorn was referring to, it’s not much better is it? The separation of church and state is supposed to be a pillar of US democracy: we should all be alarmed by politicians who seem to think they are actually preachers. Cawthorn, after all, isn’t the only high-profile figure who seems to be trying to advance a Christian nationalist agenda. Josh Hawley, a pro-Trump senator from Missouri, has spoken about the need to “take the lordship of Christ, that message, into the public realm and to seek the obedience of the nations – of our nation… to influence our society, and even more than that, to transform our society to reflect the gospel truth and lordship of Jesus Christ.” And then, of course, there’s Michael Flynn, who served as Donald Trump’s first national security adviser in 2017. Last month Flynn made headlines by calling for the establishment of “one religion” in the US. “If we are going to have one nation under God, which we must, we have to have one religion,” Flynn told a crowd in San Antonio. “One nation under God and one religion under God.” I could go on and on: there are endless examples of influential leaders in the US calling for the creation of a “Christ-centered republic” and for the bible to influence policy. But while that rhetoric is alarming, it’s not as alarming as what’s been happening behind the scenes. In 2018 the researcher Frederick Clarkson exposed the existence of a Christian supremacist initiative called Project Blitz, that aimed to flood state legislatures with bills undermining the separation of Church and State. A 116-page strategy manual laid out the plan. 1) They’d smuggle Christianity into policy with covert strategies that gave the appearance they respected religious pluralism. “The playbooks advise legislators to cloak their religious mission in the guise of more secular intentions and they’ve renamed several bills to make them sound more appealing,” Clarkson reported. 2) They’d overwhelm state legislatures with so many bills that trying to fight them would be like a game of “whack-a-mole”. 3) They’d start with less controversial bills, such as those requiring or allowing the display of “In God We Trust” in public schools, and establish small victories first. Then they’d escalate. Clarkson’s reporting on Project Blitz, and the various exposes that followed, forced the project’s organizers into stealth mode, but they haven’t disappeared. Far from it: radicalized Christian nationalism is a growing threat to American democracy, as a relatively small but incredibly organized faction working to turn the country into something resembling a theocracy. Indeed, if the insurrection on 6 January had gone ever so slightly differently, people like Flynn might be turning their dreams of “one nation under God” into a reality at this very moment. After 16 years at the top of German politics, Angela Merkel is taking a well-deserved break. The country may no longer be led by a woman but Olaf Scholz, the new chancellor, has kept his election promise to appoint a gender-balanced cabinet. Germany also now has its first female foreign minister and its first female interior minister. Not a good look for Sanna Marin, 36, who has apologised for her lack of judgement. (Still, you’ve got to admire her stamina!) The proposed register would come into effect January 2022, a year after Poland introduced a near-total ban on abortion. As I wrote in last week’s newsletter, what’s happening in Poland is part of a global trend: countries around the world are escalating attempts to coerce women into having children. As the Independent notes: “The Ghislaine Maxwell trial has revived a meaningless term that needs to be abolished: ‘underage girls’… Call them children, teens, teenage girls or minors, and call the crime committed against them what it is: sexual abuse. Not ‘sex with an underage girl.’” Even camels are forced to adhere to unrealistic beauty standards! “It is likely that all cats have an element of psychopathy as it would have once been helpful for their ancestors in terms of acquiring resources,” a new study declares. If you’re wondering whether your furry friend falls into that cat-egory, there’s an online quiz you can take called the CAT-Tri+. In the meantime, maybe sleep with one eye open.

12/11/2021,"For a double national treasure, one who could justifiably be claimed by two countries, Neil Young is hardly the most enigmatic of musical elder statesmen. Put together, the Canadian-born American’s last two albums (2019’s Colorado and now, Barn) state exactly where, and how, they were made – in a barn, in this longtime Californian’s recently adopted Colorado. Largely recorded live, both albums pair Young with his most charged powerhouse of a backing band, Crazy Horse. Perhaps more significantly, Barn is probably the least frustrating new Young album in some time. These are 10 cogent songs about love and life, about the recent past, the years long gone and our future, delivered with verve, emotion and snarls of six-string authority. Infamously, Young’s one-time label Geffen sued this prolific but bloody-minded artist in 1983 for delivering records that “were not commercial in nature and musically uncharacteristic of Young’s previous records”. Laughably, Barn actually fulfils most of those criteria. This is a Crazy Horse record that is both raucous and highly tuneful, saturated with in-band bonhomie.  “The horse’s gait in the rhythm I feel somehow/ And the melody I play,” Young croons on the album opener, Song of the Seasons. He might be referring to the equine lope that underpins a number of Barn’s tunes, but it’s no leap at all to imagine Young means the other seventysomethings arrayed behind him in the draughty outbuilding, a structure captured on the video for another of Barn’s nuanced and engrossing tracks, Welcome Back. The Horse have shape-shifted a little of late, of course: guitar stalwart Frank “Poncho” Sampedro retired after 2012’s Psychedelic Pill. As on Colorado, his place is filled by Nils Lofgren, who played with Crazy Horse in the early 70s before becoming a pillar of Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band. Lofgren’s presence is key: subtle but undeniable. Naturally, Lofgren turns up his amp for the classic, two-guitar Crazy Horse workouts – the swinging, growling Canerican, say – an autobiographical ballad in which Young pledges his troth to those twin motherlands as the band hit their resonant stride. “Canerican is what I am,” he avows, “all colours is what I am/ Stand by my brother for freedom in this land.” There’s plenty of gnarl on offer on tracks such as the furious Human Race, which imagines the blasted heath of “fires and floods” that gas-guzzling humanity is leaving in its wake. Just as often, though, Lofgren plays honky-tonk piano or accordion, lending Barn a shimmying prettiness that goes beyond the more typical Crazy Horse cordite burn. The fault that seasoned NY&CH fans will find with Barn is the relative dearth of guitar fireworks. The fadeout at the end of Canerican, mid-solo, is a perverse and self-defeating act. But the tilt towards tinkle and wheeze means that bittersweet songs gain in melancholy, as with the harmonica-and-accordion call-and-response on Song of the Seasons. Another key track, Heading West, galumphs along cheerily, Young’s guitar to the fore, recalling his idyllic childhood and his parents’ divorce, retold here as a road trip out west with his mother. The song’s breeziness is underpinned by Lofgren’s insouciant work on keys. At 76, Young is all about embracing change, prompted to some degree by his relationship with actor and environmentalist Daryl Hannah. She’s the subject of the album’s gooey centrepiece, Shape of You (nothing to do with the friskier Ed Sheeran song). Love suffuses a number of these tracks, few more so than the final cut, Don’t Forget Love. Emphasised by Crazy Horse’s falsetto backing vocals, it’s an admonition to lean into one’s better feelings. The crowning glory of this album, though, pairs Young’s tendency to baldly auto-describe with a sense of profound, possibly existential uncertainty. On one level the slow-burning They Might Be Lost finds Young and his other half pacing on the porch waiting for some guys in a truck, maybe to move some of the couple’s gear from one rural redoubt to another. (Young and Hannah recently bought a property in Omemee, Ontario, where he grew up.) This domestic scene finds Young killing time, reminiscing about the old days through “the smoke that I burn”. But the weather is changing. The truck is late. “The boys” might be lost. It’s hard to know. And the past? Who knows about that either. “The jury is out on the old days, you know,” sings Young, “the judgment is soon coming down/ I can’t quite remember what it was that I knew.” This song about not-knowing finds Crazy Horse at their most elegant and consolatory: Young’s warm harmonica and Lofgren’s discreet keys having their own quiet conversation as the rhythm section of Ralph Molina and Billy Talbot bears a steady, unobtrusive witness to Young’s thousand-yard stare.",Arts/Music,"Neil Young and Crazy Horse: Barn review – raucous, tuneful bonhomie",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/11/neil-young-and-crazy-horse-barn-review
12/11/2021,"A former Tory councillor has been convicted of killing his wife by deliberately running over her in his Mercedes at their home in France. David Turtle, 67, was found guilty of murder by a French court and sentenced to 14 years in jail.  The court at Agen in south-west France decided Turtle had deliberately driven his estate car at his wife, Stephanie, after an argument over a television programme. Police found the victim under the Mercedes in March 2017; her chest had been crushed and she had suffered severe internal injuries leading to suffocation, according to an autopsy. Turtle had claimed it was a terrible accident and he had no idea his wife, 50, was in front of or under the car when he drove off. Defence lawyers said the accused loved his wife, had no motive for killing her and there was no proof he had done so. Turtle was taken from the court to jail, but has announced he will appeal against the verdict. However, Maître Matthieu Chirez, representing the victim’s sister Catherine Seymour, told the court: “It’s not possible that he is unable to explain what happened. To say Stephanie Turtle voluntarily lay under the wheels [of the vehicle], knowing that he wanted to drive off, doesn’t make sense.” Chirez said Turtle had changed his version of events in the time since the accident. Experts said Turtle would have had great difficulty running over his wife without enormous acceleration of the car. “And that’s what he did, he ran her over … For those few seconds, that’s the horror he did to her,” Chirez told the court. The public prosecutor Patrick Serra said: “David Turtle could not have been unaware that Stephanie Turtle was in front of the car when he drove over her body.” He said there was no evidence the body had been dragged along by the vehicle. He said the accused had begun to change his story as soon as he had access to the investigation file. “He says: ‘I am the only one who knows what happened’, but this doesn’t mean that he is telling the truth … when he pressed the [accelerator] pedal, he crushed her and he couldn’t ignore the fact that she was in front,” Serra added. Maître Laurent Bruneau, from Turtle’s defence team, argued that while Turtle had killed he wife, he had not done so deliberately and said the case had been built on assuming the accused’s guilt. He said that his client was being tried because of inconsistencies in his version of events and asked: “Can anyone be coherent in such situations, after the death of his wife?” “In losing her he lost everything. Of course he killed her, how can it be said otherwise? But it was an accident. He did not see her, and has always said that.” Major Alain Chauvin, a former police officer who investigated the death, told the court that none of the witnesses questioned in connection with the death believed it was an accident. He said Turtle’s wife could not have got in front of the car without him seeing her. In a blog she kept, Stephanie Turtle mused on whether her husband treasured his new car more than he did her, saying he “mollycoddled” the vehicle and lavished it with near-obsessive attention. Jayne Clarke, 63, a friend who lived nearby, suggested David Turtle, who had not learned French, was unhappy in his new home. “I felt David was anxious, he didn’t want to stay in France any more. I felt that David was withdrawing from the [bed-and-breakfast] project and that his enthusiasm seemed to have diminished,” Carmen said. Catherine Goupil, a clinical psychologist, told the court that Turtle had received 140 letters of support from friends who couldn’t understand how he could be accused of murder. She said the couple had “a rather fusional relationship”. The couple had met in Turkey on a holiday for single people in 1996 and had no children. He had left his job as a Mercedes dealer and resigned as a Conservative councillor in Bournemouth’s Kinson North ward, and Stephanie left the human resources department of Dorset council in 2016, to move to Prayssac to run a bed-and-breakfast. “I loved my wife and I love her even more now than before because my heart is broken after what happened,” he said. “Stephanie was the love of my life. It took me 40 years to find her,” Turtle told the court. After the three-day hearing, Chirez told the Guardian: “David Turtle’s version of events made no sense. It’s perfectly impossible that he didn’t see her or hear her that evening, and so it is clear that he deliberately ran her over and killed her. “The technical investigations confirm this fact, and this is what the jury decided. Stephanie’s family and especially her sister are relieved and will continue to show the same decency they have since this terrible crime happened. She was extremely close to her sister and it is obviously a huge loss for her.” He said he and his colleagues would continue to assist the victim’s family.",News/World news,French court finds UK man guilty of murder for running over his wife,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/11/french-court-finds-uk-man-david-turtle-guilty-of-killing-his-wife
