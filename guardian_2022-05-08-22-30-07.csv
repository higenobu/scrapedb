5/8/2022,"Two stunning volleys from Sam Kerr helped Chelsea to a third consecutive WSL title as the Blues twice came from behind to earn a thrilling 4-2 win over Manchester United. With Arsenal one point behind the title holders, the destination of the WSL trophy swung between north and south London as United pushed Chelsea hard at a packed and sun-drenched Kingsmeadow. The United forward Martha Thomas gave her team the lead that would send the away fans 25 miles to the north-east, where West Ham faced second-placed Arsenal, wild with hope. Chelsea hit back through Erin Cuthbert but the visitors reclaimed the lead before the break through Ella Toone. But Kerr’s double, sandwiching a close-range effort from Guro Reiten, took her season tally to 20 and secured Chelsea a third consecutive title. Emma Hayes had been characteristically dismissive when asked whether she was feeling any pressure going into today’s game. “Look at the cost of inflation, look at the rising costs for people paying the bills, this is far from pressure, this is a joy, I love my job,” she said. The problem was that, in Manchester United, Chelsea were playing a team with a chance of reaching the Champions League for the first time. After an shaky, injury-hit start to the season, their derby rivals Manchester City had clawed their way back into third, with a two-point lead over United in fourth. Marc Skinner’s team needed a win against the holders and for Reading to take points from Manchester City. The United manager, Marc Skinner, had said they were “going to try and win” and his side began exactly as the manager hoped, with an intensity fitting of a team ready to push on and upset things at the top of the table next season. Within three minutes, a well-timed challenge from Jess Carter on the winger Leah Galton spared the home team’s blushes at a sold out and lively Kingsmeadow. Shortly afterwards, a corner from Katie Zelem caused chaos in the Chelsea box before the Blues scrambled the ball clear. In the 13th minute the visiting team took a shock but wholly deserved lead when a free-kick from Zelem was turned in by the head of the forward Martha Thomas to put Arsenal above the Blues. If there is one thing Chelsea have shown this season it is grit, and United’s lead was short lived. A long throw was lashed low past goalkeeper Mary Earps into the corner by Cuthbert. Despite Chelsea equalising, United were dominant in the middle and it wasn’t long before they regained their lead with Toone firing in from Galton’s cross from the left. If there was further evidence needed of Hayes’s ability to turn a game, it came in the second half. Defensive duo Jonna Andersson and Sophie Ingle were swapped for departing Ji So-yun and forward Beth England and Chelsea instantly asserted their authority in midfield. It took just 50 seconds into the second half for Chelsea to draw level and the source was familiar, Kerr blasting a volley into the top corner with all the fury she could muster. Five minutes later and they were back on top of the table, a draw not enough with Arsenal beating West Ham. Ji slipped the ball wide to Pernille Harder on the left and the Danish forward sent a low cross in for Reiten to sidefoot in. Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter! With the stadium rocking and the momentum well and truly swung Chelsea’s way, an audacious goal from Kerr would extend their lead and strengthen their grip on the title. Earp’s pass out was intercepted by Reiten, who headed it forward to Kerr and the Australian striker, 25 yards out and with her back to goal, cushioned the ball on her chest before turning and sending a looping volley into the net. No season can top the 2014 finale, but this went close. Then, Chelsea crumbled, relinquishing a two-point advantage over Birmingham and three-point lead over third-placed Liverpool on the final day. Here, Chelsea dug themselves out of trouble as they have so often during this title charge. Once they had usurped Arsenal at the top of the table there was no way they were stepping down.",Sport/Football,Sam Kerr’s double for Chelsea against Manchester United clinches WSL title ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/08/chelsea-manchester-united-womens-super-league-wsl-match-report
5/8/2022,"Saturday Night Live kicks off the final run of episodes for season 47 by immediately diving into the supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade. In his draft of the majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito argues that abortion is a crime by citing a treatise from 13th century England. The show takes us back a thousand years ago to see the drafting of those original laws. A group of English nobles (Andrew Dismukes, James Austin Johnson and Benedict Cumberbatch) debate among themselves – one of them shoots down making exceptions for rape and incest since “those are the only kinds of sex” – while ignoring the protests of an eavesdropping chambermaid (Cecily Strong). Eventually, they’re joined by a witch (Kate McKinnon) who can see into the future. She relays her visions of progress and gives a rallying cry to women to fight back. Once again proving how utterly incapable it is of tackling momentous political occasions, Saturday Night Live completely phones it in here. The sketch doesn’t even commit to its lame premise: there are only a handful of comparisons between our society and the Dark Ages before we get in a groan-inducing joke about the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial and are subjected to McKinnon’s awful mugging. Her call to action at the end rings especially hollow, but at least she didn’t perform another sad piano ballad. Cumberbatch is the night’s host. The actor admits to being annoyed that all the sketches pitched to him by Lorne and the writers revolve around Dr Strange, rather than his Oscar-nominated turn in The Power of The Dog. Of that nomination, he says, “I didn’t win. I was beat by Will Smith – not physically! Not physically!” He then uses the occasion to wish his mom and his wife a happy Mother’s Day and thank them over some soft piano. There’s almost nothing here in the way of actual jokes. The holiday theme carries into the first sketch, which sees Aidy Bryant receiving Mother’s Day gifts from her family. They’ve all gotten her wooden novelty signs from Home Depot. The sayings on them start out innocuous and treacly – “Mom spelled upside down is WOW!” – before growing increasingly accusatory and personal: “Dear mom, we sucked your teats dry and now you look weird in a bathing suit,” “Were your ears ringing? I was in therapy,” “Having a mother-in-law is like having crabs.” It’s a near carbon copy of a previous sketch from a couple of seasons ago and a case of diminishing returns. The is true of the pre-filmed sketch that comes a little later, in which a teenage daughter argues with her mother and grandmother about her partying. We cut back and forth between the older women’s grandstanding and flashbacks to their own wild youths, which see them drinking hard, popping pills, driving drunk, having casual sex and throwing panties at the stage during a David Bowie concert. The show has used this template several times before, but it never quite works because the reckless behavior on display doesn’t get crazy enough. Before that though, we get one the strangest sketches of the season, in which a focus group tests out new ice cream treats. Two of the members (Cumberbatch and Heidi Gardner) are gruff cowpokes, and their feedback takes the form of long, soul-bearing soliloquies filled with longing, nostalgia, regret and plenty of cowboy poetry. This ultimately begets a romance of Bridges of Madison County/Brokeback Mountain proportions. It all goes on a bit too long, but it gets lots of points for originality and Cumberbatch’s performance (he seems to be taking the piss out of vocal Power of the Dog critic Sam Elliot). At a prison work camp, a group of convicts pass the time while breaking rocks by singing a blues ballad. Cumberbatch’s prisoner earns the suspicion of his fellow inmates when he sings about “snitching to the warden” and “sleeping with the warden’s wife”. There’s no payoff to this setup, but the cast is clearly having fun playing broad, old-timey caricatures and their energy proves infectious. Then on Weekend Update, Michael Che acknowledges how the overturning of Roe v Wade will disproportionately affect poor people: “Most Americans don’t have access to the same resources I do. The average person can’t just text Lorne in the middle of the night, ‘Yo, it happened again.’” Colin Jost welcomes on supreme court justice Amy Coney Barrett (McKinnon) on to discuss the issue. Barrett says she “listened to the case with an open mind and I asked all my question,” and encourages women to just “do your nine and dump”. Landsdown House is a Downton Abbey-style drama. A family of aristocrats is thrown into turmoil when one of their own announces he’s signed up to fight in the front lines of the first world war. His sister’s repeated hysterics see her continually miss the fainting couch in favor of trashing the entire estate (the poor family butler takes the brunt of the damage). This feels like a ripoff of a much funnier Mr Show sketch from 24 years ago. A cinematic commercial for a new reclining toilet from Kohler (“#1 in #2 since 1873”) sees Cumberbatch play a suave disrupter who interrupts a totalitarian toilet training class by dumping out in grand style (he literally uses pages from the rule book as TP). It’s a funny enough idea, but it’s over almost as soon as it begins. An animatronic performance at Chuck E Cheeze gets cancelled due to a technical malfunction, so the manager gets Reflection Denied, a British new wave band from the 80’s, to fill in. Cumberbatch and Bowen Yang perform a (legitimately catchy) queer-themed, ennui-filled song about pizza, prizes and the salad bar (“an untouched place where hope goes to die”). As with most of the sketches tonight, it doesn’t wrap up so much as fizzle out. The show wraps up with a pre-filmed segment in which Chloe Fineman details her role as the show’s official understudy. The setup is an excuse for her to do impersonations of all her fellow women cast members – save Ego Nwodim (who wisely orders her to “Pass”) and Punkie Johnson, who’s her understudy. At one point, she also tries to trick Cumberbatch into helping her land a role in the MCU by pretending to be his Dr. Strange co-star Elizabeth Olsen, only for the real Olsen to show up (Cumberbatch’s dumbfounded proclamation that “The multiverse is real” gets the biggest laugh of the night.) On the whole, this was a middle of the road episode, although it was a notable improvement on last month’s dire output. Cumberbatch, like so many of the hosts this season, displayed impressive comic chops, but wasn’t given much to work with. Meanwhile, SNL failed to mine any humor from the supreme court’s monstrous actions but given how the bad the political comedy on the show has been for the last decade-plus, that should come as no surprise.",Arts/Television & radio,Saturday Night Live: a game Benedict Cumberbatch tries to save a patchy episode,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/08/saturday-night-live-benedict-cumberbatch-host
5/8/2022,"The dancers in Matsena Productions’ Shades of Blue are constantly under siege. Spotlights search the stage, guns are pulled, there’s a perpetual sense of anxiety and relentless pressure. They’re even attacked by the mechanics of the theatre, a curtain that rises only a metre, bodies confined on the ground below; a lighting rig that plummets, flooring the dancers beneath. They are literally oppressed by the structures around them. There’s no obfuscation about the subject matter in this powerful piece by brothers Anthony and Kel Matsena, born in Zimbabwe, raised in Wales. Shades of Blue is an extension of work they made during lockdown in response to police brutality, Black Lives Matter and, no doubt, their own life experience. The cast of nine burst on to the stage with intense energy, projected outwards in a flurry of isolations, pops and freezes (the Matsenas’ background is in hip-hop, but they bring the same raw urgency to more contemporary moves), yet directed inwards it becomes increasingly tormented and destructive. There’s a stop and search scene, orders barked at Kel to follow. He grows ever more frantic in this sinister Simon Says: scrambling, prostrate, head bowed, trying to defuse the situation, terrified of making a “wrong” move. It’s PTSD in the making, traumatic to watch let alone experience and all credit to Kel, who carries the dramatic weight across the work. Shades of Blue shares a double bill with Warrior Queens, from choreographer Julia Cheng’s House of Absolute. Cheng was recently nominated for an Olivier award for her work on the musical Cabaret. This is something different. As the title suggests, six strong women, feet planted wide in the earth, arms swiping and blocking like wise and fierce fighters. More than anything this is a work of flavourful atmosphere, with brilliant live drumming from Chinese percussionist Beibei Wang. There’s something reminiscent of Akram Khan in the sense of ancient roots, mythological figures in rituals of import and portent. The dancers demonstrate speed, articulation and power – Jonadette Carpio particularly stands out – but the work could be further developed. Regardless, these are all talents on the rise.",Arts/Stage,"Matsena Productions / House of Absolute review – intense, raw dance",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/08/matsena-productions-house-of-absolute-review-sadlers-wells-dance
5/8/2022,"Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese have bickered over electricity prices, national security and a federal integrity commission in a the second leaders’ debate of the election campaign. Ahead of early voting opening on Monday, the prime minister appealed for Australians to stick with certainty, while the Labor leader said the country could not afford three more years of the Coalition. Facing questions from a panel of three journalists from the Nine network, the most heated moment of the night was when the two leaders argued about Chinese influence in the region. Morrison was asked to explain his remark that a Chinese base in Solomon Islands would be viewed as a “red line” by the Australian government, to which he said it would be “unwise” to speculate. “It means that was something Australia believes would be completely against our national interest, and we also believe it will be against the Solomon Islands’ national interest,” Morrison said. After Morrison challenged Albanese on why Labor had cut defence spending, Albanese raised the sale of the Port of Darwin to a company linked to the Chinese Communist party. “When I was a minister, we put US marines into Darwin. When you have been a minister, we’ve had the port of Darwin sold to a company connected with the Chinese Communist party. You ticked it off.” Morrison accused Albanese of telling “this lie for some time”, saying the federal government had no authority over the sale of territory assets. The two men then argued, with Morrison accusing Albanese of being unable to stand up to China when the “loudest” pro-Beijing voices came from within the Labor party. “How often has Richard Marles met with the Chinese ambassador in Australia? He is your deputy leader,” Morrison asked? “That is an outrageous slur,” Albanese said. Another fiery moment came when the two disagreed over how Labor’s pledge to transition the electricity grid might affect power prices. Morrison asked how much more Labor would spend on transmission, saying it would be recovered from the consumers and lead to price rises: “That’s how it works.” Albanese said there “is not an energy economist in the country that agrees with you”. After talking about party unity on the issue of net zero by 2050, Albanese accused Morrison of being unable to commit to a higher near-term target because “Barnaby Joyce won’t let you make the target higher”. Morrison said he did not think a higher target than a 26% to 28% cut on 2005 levels by 2035 was good policy, despite the likelihood of reaching that level. “I think it is the wrong policy. I don’t want to put up people’s electricity prices.” The debate kicked off with the two leaders challenged on cost-of-living pressures, asked what they could do about the $5 cost of lettuce. Morrison pointed to the measures announced in the budget, including the cut to fuel excise and tax cuts. “We cannot control all the forces that are coming from overseas, but what we can do, by managing money well, that puts downward pressure on inflation.” Albanese said his party had policies designed to achieve cheaper childcare and cheaper medicines, that were “aimed at growing the economy in a way that doesn’t put additional pressure on inflation”. “The cost of living measures that [Morrison] spoke about are all temporary, they have all the sincerity of a fake tan, they disappear once people have cast their vote and people are then back on their own again.” Both ruled out an extension of the cut to fuel excise, which ends in September. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On industrial relations, Albanese was asked to guarantee that wage prices would outstrip inflation if he formed government, prompting the Labor leader to promise wages would be higher than under the Coalition. “Our objective is to have real wage increases and we have practical plans to do that,” he said. On the economy, Morrison defended the forecast debt in the budget, saying the pandemic had required the government to spend more, and borrow to do so. “In the pandemic we had to lean in and save the economy through jobkeeper, the single largest economic intervention which saved lives, livelihoods and businesses and that expenditure ensured the Australian economy could be where it is today,” Morrison said. When asked how young Australians would pay the debt off, Morrison said they would be in work. “They will have jobs in an economy coming out of this pandemic stronger than any other advanced economy in the world.” Albanese was asked about what Labor was doing for young Australians “dealing with rising rents, out of reach house prices [and] student debt”. “Young people are doing it really tough, no doubt about that,” he said. The Labor leader said he was promising increased investment in social housing and a plan for 10,000 affordable housing units for essential workers. On an integrity commission, the two leaders were asked if they had seen corruption in their parties and what they had done about it. Morrison said he had not seen any corruption in the Liberal party over the past three years, and when asked about New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption findings regarding developer donations said he had no knowledge of the issue. “You are assuming I have some knowledge or awareness or involvement in those issues, which I clearly do not.” But Morrison said he still believed there was a need for a federal integrity commission, pointing to the government’s draft bill that has stalled in the parliament. Albanese acknowledged there had been corruption within NSW Labor, but said “there was a stench” around Canberra that needed to be addressed. “I think overwhelmingly, people go into politics across the spectrum for all the right reasons. They go in to take their view about how they help their fellow Australians in the best way possible. But the truth is, there is a stench around Canberra at the moment.” Morrison then challenged Albanese over the party’s lack of draft legislation for such a commission, which Labor has promised to introduce this year. “Given he is so passionate about this, why haven’t you drafted your own legislation for such a commission? You have had three years. You have two pages. “You’ve been hiding in the bushes.” Albanese said Labor would release legislation this year. “Our democracy is precious ... we need to make sure that Australians can have faith in it and that is why we need to do whatever we can to create institutions and structures that enhance that faith in our political system.” Morrison and Albanese were also asked about the government’s pandemic management, with the prime minister acknowledging he should not have said the vaccine rollout was not a race. “It was a race, Anthony, and we shouldn’t have described it in those terms,” Morrison said. In his closing remarks, Morrison said the choice at the election would “impact significantly on the future of all Australians.” “We are a known quantity, and at a time of great uncertainty, now is not the time to risk things on the unknown. “Labor have no plan, they are unknown, and a small target is always a big risk.” Albanese said Australia had the opportunity for a “better government”. “With a better government, we can be an even better country into the future. And I will say this – there are four words you will never hear from me. words you will never hear from me: ‘That’s not my job.’ I will never say it. “If I get the job, I will do the job each and every day.” Channel Nine’s “viewer verdict” initially had Morrison the winner, then Albanese, before the result came in at a 50-50 tie.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese clash over cost of living and integrity in messy leaders’ debate,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/08/scott-morrison-and-anthony-albanese-clash-over-cost-of-living-and-integrity-in-messy-leaders-debate

5/8/2022,"For the past two years, I have been trying really hard to become an #influencer. I just wanted to #influence people to live their best lives, to find their inner strength and – OK, I wanted free stuff. If you can’t beat it, join it. Capitalism, that is. Since I have 100,000 followers on Instagram who listen to what I say, to whom I often recommend my favourite products and services, why not double-check if the brands want to pay me to do so? I would rather they pay me than someone who isn’t me. What I am saying is: I wanted to do the very easy job of #influencing and get lots of money for it. I assume, since you are reading the Guardian, you are frowning disapprovingly while sucking on an avocado because #influencing is vapid and superficial. But are you really telling me that, if someone offered you £1,000 to take a photo of the aforementioned avocado and post it to Instagram using the hashtag #avocadosrule and tagging @avocado in the post, you wouldn’t be tempted? I made an oath: I would never lie. I would never recommend anything that I didn’t use or want to use myself. And I wouldn’t stop being myself on social media: I would keep posting about social issues. If brands didn’t like that, I wouldn’t work with them. It was time to take my followers and turn them into cash money. I started with a few #gifted skincare products and a gold card to my favourite all-you-can-eat Sunday roast buffet restaurant. Someone offered me £800 to post a photo of myself in a neon green thong, but I’m not sure if that was a brand deal or if that was just … a man. Then an #influencing agency signed me – as an actual #influencer. I was so excited. I laughed when my new agents told me that they would, of course, give me some training – until I realised they weren’t joking. I was taken through the seven apps I needed in order to be a content creator – it turns out that the average photo needs to go through at least three photo-editing apps before it’s worth posting – and I was taught about hashtags and algorithms. Posting in the morning or evening is best: that is when people are on their way to work or relaxing at home. Don’t post at weekends; people aren’t on their phones. You can hide your hashtags in the comments section and they still work. Differentiate between photos of your face, your body, food, beauty and nature. Stick to one colour scheme across your grid. Once you have posted, spend half an hour commenting on people’s comments: Instagram rewards engagement by showing your post to more people. And so on. Then my home was dissected. My dinner plates were all shiny – they should be matt. My table tops were shiny, too – I would need to get special photoshoot backgrounds that look like fancy marble counters on which to pose my food. Now, I constantly notice how shiny everything is: my cutlery, my picture frames, my forehead. It’s all very not #Instagrammable. I have gained so much respect for #influencers. You have to get up early, because morning light is the best. You have to have a tidy – and matt – house. Your food always gets cold, because it takes for ever to curate a photo of it. You have to understand complex and ever-changing social media algorithms. You have to plan ahead and think strategically. It’s a full-time job, not an easy side hustle. I find myself desperately clinging to my job as a comedian and trying to merge the two: to be funny in my #sponcon (sponsored content) so that no one notices the mess in the background, or the fact that it’s dark outside because I slept until 4pm. Of course, beauty standards suck, materialism is the worst and “perfect” social media posts make people feel super-insecure about themselves. But it’s hard for me to blame the women who have found a way to get rich by taking advantage of a beauty- and perfection-obsessed, toxic and capitalist system. Because it’s way harder than it looks.

Rochelle Harri Stop worrying about your individual carbon footprint. Use the time you spent worrying to organise civil society by collectively push for green policy. The idea that you can influence carbon emissions by changing your individual behaviour is a straw man. Modern economy does not supply to demand, but demands cheap supplies and distributes them, creating imagined needs at any cost. Change the system, not yourself. Pjotr Elshout Heat your feet!

Martin Lewis’s tips to keep warm without the central heating can make a massive difference and save you money, too. Ian Glatt, London Replace your gas stove, gas furnace, gas hot water tank, and gas clothes dryer with heat pump equivalents. Higher upfront costs, but significantly lower life cycle costs. And, as the grid goes green, so too does your home. Bill Rau Stop cryptocurrencies. Prof Petra Molthan-Hill Petition your local and national government for assistance with home retrofit costs and install an air-source heat pump, together with improved insulation. Your heat pump will provide heat in winter, cooling in summer and filtered clean air – this results in no need for gas or coal in your home. Judith Brook, British Columbia Stop buying and eating commercial fish and unsustainable farm products. Lotus Boyanton Your carbon footprint doesn’t really matter, and neither does mine. Just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of climate change. Solving this problem is easy. We just need governments with the cojones to do it. YesPrecisely The UK’s carbon emissions are mainly from surface transport and heating, so get an electric car (or stop driving and stop getting deliveries) and get a heat pump. People get very hung up on flying, perhaps as a way of shifting blame to other people who are frequent flyers, but it’s a minor part of our problems. Randomusername222 The individual carbon footprint of an average European is about 10 tonnes of CO2e a year, more than twice the global average. Lifestyle factors affect the precise makeup, but broadly this splits into five equal components of about two tonnes of CO2e a year each. There are therefore five highly effective steps of broadly equal weight ranked in order of relative ease as follows: 1) Switch to a genuine renewable energy supplier for all electricity and heat requirements. Ideally heat is provided by electricity (via a heat pump) as this also avoids other emissions such as fugitive. Avoids two tonnes of CO2e a year. 2) Become vegan. Avoids two tonnes of CO2e a year (assuming avoidance of three portions of meat including one portion of beef a week). 3) Stop flying. Avoids two tonnes of CO2e a year (assuming eight flight hours per annum avoided). 4) Stop driving an internal-combustion-engined car. Avoids two tonnes of CO2e a year (assuming medium-sized car and 8,000 miles per annum). 5) Reduce consumption and waste focusing on clothing, electrical goods, plastic avoidance and food waste avoidance. Potential to avoid two tonnes of CO2e a year, but most difficult to achieve. Consider genuine offsets. The 1.5C pathway requires us all to get to within two tonnes of CO2e a year, so there is scope for some emissions and in future goods and services will become less carbon-intensive. Rolf Stein he answer depends on your current lifestyle (mainly energy consumption) and knowing where your emissions are generated.

Andy Gale The single most effective thing you can do to reduce your carbon is avoid having children (not the easiest choice for many). The next most important action is to stop driving a car. If that’s not possible, drive an electric car. If you don’t drive or fly, the next most important action is to install solar or buy green power. If you have already done that, go vegan. Rebecca Blackburn Support or join a coalition like Just Stop Oil and collectively demand that the UK government stops granting new fossil-fuel licences. If successful, this will be the biggest reduction you will ever make to your carbon footprint. Paul Fawkesley As was pointed out in Rebecca Solnit’s article last year, the term “carbon footprint” was invented by PR company Ogilvy and Mather for BP as a means to shift blame for the climate crisis on to individuals and deflect it from the corporations responsible for promoting an economy completely reliant on fossil fuels. The best thing you can do to reduce your carbon footprint is to blockade an oil refinery, protest on the streets, or chain yourself to the gates of parliament and make a big noise about the corrupt and stinking cartel at the centre of our extractive capitalist economy. Just Stop Oil! Hubeth New To reduce emissions, choosing to have a small family, or forgoing having biological children, is best. If the goal is to mitigate the overall impact of the crisis, on many social and ecological levels. Promoting Fair Start family reforms is the best move. Carter Dillard, University of Denver College of Law My family’s was the national average of approximately 11 tonnes of CO2e in 2006. Being more careful with home heating and cutting out most flying reduced it to eight tonnes the following year. By 2021 the national average had reduced to six tonnes (mainly due to replacing coal with gas-fired electricity plus industry efficiencies) and ours was 3.6 tonnes (two tonnes direct and 1.6 tonnes secondary emissions) helped by a more fuel-efficient, carefully driven car, less mileage, frugal electricity use and being vegetarian. Further significant reductions will require moving car or house heating to 100% renewable electricity, either being very costly. The UK national target set in 2008 is equivalent to five tonnes by 2030 and two tonnes by 2050, so we all have a way to go. We need more ambitious government action but as individuals we can do our bit. Simon Austin Is there one single individual action which will solve the crisis? No. And yet … can we lead healthier lives where we’re in sync with nature and our local – and global – communities? That’s the prize. Greener and cleaner means slower and happier. Dr Noah Birksted-Breen, Oxford Flying Less podcast Reduce what you buy (includes reduce, reuse, repair, rent and recycle). Gets rid of the carbon footprint from extracting raw materials, process plants, packaging, transport, storage and disposal. If it’s clothes, it also stops water being diverted from those that need it to cotton fields. Melanie Boyle It’s easy to looks at the things that are defined – get an electric car, get a heat pump, go vegan, buy less clothes, stop flying, and so on. All are good advice. But I say also, go little. All the little things we consume add up to one big old mess of wasted production, use, and then rubbish. Garden centres full of plastic tubs and plastic labels and plastic garden decorations, and solar lights using the smallest of microchips, but there are tens of thousands of them out there. Precious metals shipped to China, transformed in a factory, using energy to be joined with pretty plastics decorations, then shipped back around the world and into our gardens because they look oh so cute. Only for then to stop working after a year and go in the bin. Of course we can still have nice pointless things, but let’s have better nice pointless things. Long-lasting, well made, repairable, resellable, made from renewable sources. confused23 I no longer shower every day and I don’t think I smell. Saves water and power.

You could even aim to get detained for attending an XR demo.
