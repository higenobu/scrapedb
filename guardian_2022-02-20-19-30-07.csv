2/20/2022,"When is a classical music composition not actually classical? This is the conundrum now at the heart of a heated row over the shortlisted songs for the Grammys, the annual awards that will be handed out in a few weeks’ time to recognise outstanding contributions to music. A number of musicians have collectively expressed their outrage that nominations for the “classical music” awards include recordings they consider anything but classical. Letters of complaint have been sent to the organisers, the Recording Academy, arguing that the tracks in question – by two separate artists, Jon Batiste and Curtis Stewart – have been “mis-categorised”.  Their objections have absolutely nothing to do with quality, but genre, say the musicians. They believe that “mistaken categorisation” jeopardises the credibility of the music industry’s highest honours. Though not disputing the brilliance of the Oscar-winning Batiste, they believe that his track, Batiste: Movement 11’, should not have been nominated for best contemporary classical composition. While they similarly admire the multi-Grammy nominated Stewart, they believe his album, Of Power, should not have been nominated for best classical instrumental solo. Composer Marc Neikrug, a former Grammy nominee, told the Observer that Batiste is a pop musician and that nominating his recording for a classical music award is baffling. “How much sense do you think it makes to a serious novelist when Bob Dylan gets a Nobel prize for literature?”, he said. “It’s not that what Bob Dylan does isn’t magnificent in what it is. But it’s not Nobel literature.” In a letter to the academy he wrote: “As a serious, dedicated composer of what has always been considered ‘classical’ music, I am dismayed. I have spent 60 years studying and labouring at this precise craft. It is unfathomable that an organisation which is supposed to have some inherent knowledge of music would choose to re-categorise an entire segment of our inherited culture.” The Recording Academy represents “all music professionals”, from performers to engineers, all of whom are eligible to vote for the awards. It stages the 64th Grammy awards show on 3 April, recognising the achievements of recordings released in the year until September 2021. Professor Apostolos Paraskevas of Berklee College of Music, Boston, is equally perturbed by the inclusion of Batiste and Stewart. “I’m not going to say that classical music is better than jazz. I love both genres,” he said. “Both of those musicians deserve the recognition for their work. But we cannot compare apples and oranges.” He added: “If you look at the nominees for the best contemporary classical composition, you see amazing musicians who write operas and symphonies. Batiste’s piece is two minutes long, someone playing sequences in the jazz style. If this person gets an award, this is a big slap on our face. It’s a message to everyone that we should give up and just do this.” He, too, has sent a letter to the academy, telling it: “I am a voting member of the Recording Academy and I have seen minor inconsistencies over the years in the results, but nothing in comparison to what is happening this year.” He added: “This jeopardises the credibility of the Grammy awards.” Asgerdur Sigurdardottir, a classical producer and the head of Tonar Music Management, which specialises in classical guitarists, also questioned whether the music of Batiste and Stewart belongs in classical music categories. “My argument is: why should I personally be able to even vote in the gospel category or reggae? I have no expertise in that field, but yet I am able to vote. This also means that people that have no classical expertise are able to vote in the classical fields.” Stewart, who studied at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, has performed as a classical soloist at the Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall, and held chamber music residencies at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He said that he does not need to justify his music’s inclusion in the classical music category but hopes that it “can connect a divide that has hurt and ostracised classical music from a world of listeners for decades”. He added: “My work attempts to draw question marks to categories. I think of myself as a classical musician.” On his classical music blog Slipped Disc, Norman Lebrecht, a British music journalist and author who specialises in issues concerning classical music, wrote that he had received numerous complaints that this year’s Grammys were muddying the classical award sections with non-classical entries. His report sparked a flurry of Facebook comments, with one supporter telling Stewart: “Your musicianship is of the highest calibre however they want to categorise it.” Batiste studied at the world-renowned Juilliard School in New York City. In 2018, he received a Grammy nomination for best American roots performance. In 2021, he won the Oscar for best original score for the Disney/Pixar film Soul, shared with fellow composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Batiste’s record company and the Recording Academy were approached, but declined to comment.",Arts/Music,‘How is this classical music?’ Composers’ fury at Grammys shortlist,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/20/how-is-this-classical-music-composers-fury-at-grammys-shortlist
2/20/2022,"For three decades after the second world war, US scientists and doctors carried out a research programme of striking ambition – and breathtaking moral negligence. They deliberately infected more than 1,000 people, including at least 100 children, with hepatitis, an illness that can trigger chronic liver disease and cancer. Very few of those subjected to this experimentation had much idea of what was being inflicted upon them. Many were poor and uneducated and came from prisons, asylums and orphanages. A disproportionate number were black.  “I know of no series of problematic infectious disease studies that involved a wider array of devalued and stigmatised groups,” Sydney Halpern tells us in this chilling, unsparing account of a mass experiment that violated the rights and health of America’s underprivileged from 1942 to 1972. Subjects included prison inmates, draft objectors who were already derided as “yellowbellies” and adults and minors with intellectual impairments. “The use of such a broad range of marginalised groups is astounding,” adds Halpern, a US sociologist and bioethicist. The fact that this mass violation of human rights continued for so long is perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of this story. How could these decades-long trials have been permitted in a society that believed itself to be untainted by crimes that had typified its Nazi opponents? Halpern is at pains to find rational answers to such questions, but in the end struggles to find coherence in the motives of the scientists involved or to discover any doubts they may have had about the ethics of their behaviour. The nation had allowed the creation of a military-biomedical elite that decided the need to control disease and defend the nation justified actions that clearly led to the early deaths of innocent people. Worse, they were largely supported by a supine, deferential press. Hepatitis is a disease characterised by inflammation of the liver, jaundice, fever and exhaustion and is caused, we now know, by three different virus variants: A, B and C. In some cases, those infected can develop cirrhosis and liver cancer in later life. In 1942, a major outbreak occurred among US soldiers. This was traced to a contaminated batch of yellow fever vaccine whose serum had been derived from hepatitis carriers. Scientists decided to take advantage of these sullied samples and used them to infect men, women and, later on, children in a bid to understand more about hepatitis. These studies were expanded over the decades, with researchers persuading their recruits to directly ingest samples of tainted material. These included milkshakes made from infected human excrement mixed into chocolate milk in a bid to conceal its true contents. “What scientists did was create a pool of hepatitis carriers at risk for slowly simmering, life-threatening liver diseases,” writes Halpern. Just how many died as a direct result of the US hepatitis programme is unclear, so clandestine were its operations. Undoubtedly, there would have been fatalities. Not all these dangers were known when the hepatitis programme began, Halpern acknowledges. Yet even when they did become evident, no one bothered to try to trace those who had developed liver disease or pinpoint those who had died because of scientists’ actions. In the end, the programme was brought down by 1960s activism. Campaigns against the Vietnam war and for minority rights heightened sensitivity to the actions of the authorities and young doctors began to question the programme with increasing vigour. “I moved easily from civil rights to patients’ rights,” one young doctor told Halpern. The programme ended, effectively, in 1972. Halpern’s story is chilling, told with clarity and commendable brevity and, most importantly, is of crucial relevance today. The emergence of Covid-19 galvanised calls for the creation of experiments in which volunteers would be infected with SARS-CoV-2 to help understand how the disease spreads and behaves. Some of these studies continue. But as she warns, the long-term consequences of infection are unknown and are not likely to be fully understood for years. “It is therefore vitally important to understand human experiments with dangerous viruses during a previous emergency.” America’s hepatitis programme has a lot to tell us from that perspective.

2/20/2022,"I have got used to thinking that new theatre arrives in an explosion of form. Yet – obvious but true – sometimes fresh subject matter alone is the vital thing. Straightforward in structure, occasionally too explicit but dynamic in its argumentative twists, Two Billion Beats sets up an urgent thrum. Sonali Bhattacharyya’s two-hander constantly surprises as it spins from bullying to sibling rivalry and the difficulty of not fibbing when speaking up.  A clever schoolgirl with a Hindu background challenges her mother, who reveres Gandhi, with her own preference for BR Ambedkar, spokesman for “untouchables”. Her enthusiasm for the ideals of the most politically radical of the Pankhursts, Sylvia, brings her into confrontation with a teacher inclined to think this prize pupil will go further if she concentrates on studying people with brown faces. When her sister exaggerates a Muslim boy’s bullying, she takes his side. Nimmo Ismail’s absorbing production sets Anoushka Chadha and Safiyya Ingar on a concrete stage, alone apart from a hamster, of whose presence the audience is warned. Moving towards self-determination, they are slangy and fervent and sharp. Their school uniforms hang off them like the unsuitable assumptions they are trying to shuck. They are better than babes: they are unclassifiable. Sian Carter’s first play also unfolds without structural flourishes, but it has at its centre an intricate knot: the concealments of the open-hearted. Three generations of a British Caribbean family are living together. The grandparents are of Windrush vintage; their granddaughter dreams of making her own flight. Sorrow, guilt and social anxiety have turned the death of a son and the illness of a bipolar daughter into unmentioned subjects. Running With Lions turns on the patient warmth – but also the sheer accident – that eventually unlocks their secrecy. Michael Buffong’s production for Talawa, the black touring company of which he is artistic director, leaps over the stiltedness of some over-declamatory dialogue. The family dance together – over-optimistically to Let the Good Times Roll – and bump each other knowingly hip to hip. Ruby Barker – of Bridgerton – has a steady radiance and Wil Johnson beguiles with sinuous mischief. Soutra Gilmour’s design suggests precariousness, high hopes and long voyages: rupture and reconciliation take place on a shifting platform under a dazzling, starry sky. Florian Zeller’s plays have altered the landscape of British theatre. Apparently bourgeois domestic dramas can crack open the stage with distress. A man with dementia is surrounded by scenery that keeps being dismantled. A woman quietly peels mushrooms while bereavement conjures illusions. The mushroom moment was part of Jonathan Kent’s superb production of The Height of the Storm in 2018. Now Kent directs the world premiere of The Forest, in a version by Zeller’s long-time English translator Christopher Hampton. Anna Fleischle’s design is sinister and sleek: glossy parquet; a portrait whose subject unaccountably changes; a mass of stiff bouquets that begin to look like floral tributes. The stage, divided horizontally and vertically, echoes the fractures of the plot, in which unnamed characters – “Man 1”, “The Wife” – step unexplained into each other’s roles, and dream merges with action. The thriller element – did an adulterer hire a contract killer? Is a blood-boltered figure a ghost? What is that Big Dead Beast on a bed? – grips, but too many of the play’s mysteries look like ways of diverting attention from a thinly conventional plot and sketchy characterisation. You may never know where you are, but there’s not much mystery about who you can trust. Toby Stephens has a flair for suggesting the inauthentic, and uses it to the hilt. Gina McKee’s talent runs in the opposite direction: she is not given much to do, but emits honour from every pore. There is a rigid, possibly satirical performance from Silas Carson and a gleamingly macabre turn by Finbar Lynch. Intriguing rather than resonant. Eugène Ionesco’s work plays peek-a-boo with its audiences, waggishly semaphoring its lack of significance. The Chairs (1952) is like Beckett’s Endgame without the pungency. An elderly couple daily repeat the same routine to an invisible audience – a growing number of empty chairs. They await a speaker who will say nothing. They jump to their deaths. Yet what on the page is skinny and over-insistent can on stage be haunting and frisky. Twenty-five years ago, Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan were beautifully comic in a tumbling Complicité production. Now, Omar Elerian impressively stages his own translation. The design by Cécile Trémolières and Naomi Kuyck-Cohen is the perfect tease: four sets of frowsty velvet curtains looped in front of each other; pretence revealing further pretence. Kathryn Hunter, skittering in an orange wig (with dark roots) and scarlet stockings, looks like a marionette – Ionesco was transfixed by puppets – while her extraordinary voice, unearthly yet inward, swoops from piping to guttural. Marcello Magni – Hunter’s husband on and offstage – is casually nimble, deftly snatching chairs from the air and ensuring that his placing of a cup in its saucer is disconcertingly not synchronised with the clinking sound effect. Together they swing an imaginary child and walk from opposite sides of the stage, each carrying half of an unseen window. In a surprise coda, Toby Sedgwick arrives as the expected non-speaking speaker – and blasts Ionesco’s airiness with a brilliantly delivered naturalistic oration. The most vivacious, surprising part of the evening was not written by the Romanian-French dramatist. Still, subverting subversion: what could be more apt for elusive Ionesco?

2/20/2022,"Mothers are being unnecessarily separated from their newborns in some hospitals due to overly-stringent Covid-19 rules, leading birth charities have warned. They say inconsistent policies by some trusts mean parents have been made to isolate away from their babies for longer than national guidance stipulates – either after having Covid or as a contact of a positive case.  The charity Birthrights wrote to one trust in support of a woman whose baby was receiving care on the neonatal unit at London’s University College Hospital. Kate Ellis-Martin was told she couldn’t see her baby for 10 days because her husband had tested positive for Covid-19 upon their arrival for a planned Caesarean section on 31 January. Ellis-Martin said: “I had been double-vaccinated and tested negative but I was still told I couldn’t go to the unit to hold my baby. After the birth I held him for about 20 seconds and then he was taken straight to the unit because he was having problems breathing. “My mum could visit the unit and there was a webcam set up so I could see him from my room but after a couple of days I began to get very distressed.” It was only after being transferred to another hospital, four days after the birth that Ellis-Martin was able to hug her baby for the first time. She says: “We are bonding well but 10 days of separation would have had a really negative impact.” Maria Booker, programmes director at Birthrights, said: “At times we are seeing a focus on infection control at the expense of human rights and psychological safety and our concern is, two years into the pandemic, when are we going to learn that lesson?” After the charity wrote to the trust saying its guidance did not appear to follow the latest national guidance for mothers testing negative, the trust said it would update its policy. Ellis-Martin said she was delighted and relieved at the news. “I’m not surprised it has changed as it was outdated and wrong. I did feel for the midwives because they didn’t write the policy and had a lot of stress to deal with because of it. I wouldn’t want other mums to go through the same thing.” Another woman who wanted to remain anonymous said she was left traumatised after being separated from her baby born at the same hospital in early January. She was admitted in December with pregnancy complications and later caught Covid-19 on the antenatal ward. The woman, who had been triple vaccinated and tested negative before the birth of her baby on day eight of her isolation period said: “After the birth my baby was taken away before I could hold her which was really distressing.” The baby, born prematurely was taken to the neonatal unit and quickly improved. But the mother was prevented from seeing her because trust policy stated the isolation period for inpatients with Covid-19 was 14 days. “I missed the first three days of her life. I don’t understand why there couldn’t have been an opportunity to hold her sooner. We were both negative. “This has been one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. In the end I discharged myself before feeling physically ready so I could visit my baby as an outpatient because the isolation for outpatients was only 10 days.” She said when she eventually went to meet her baby she wasn’t allowed to hold her and was left in shock. During her second visit to the unit she said she “cried hysterically” until staff allowed her contact. “There were staff who were working really hard in difficult circumstances and I understand the hospital needs policies to keep everyone safe. But I felt there was an enormous lack of compassion in the application of their Covid policies which are hugely draconian.” Her frustrations were compounded by the apparent contradiction with guidance for staff who were able to come to work after seven days if they had tested negative. The British Association of Perinatal Medicine strongly supports the view that parents are partners in their baby’s care, not visitors, and recommends the same rules should apply to them as staff working on neonatal units. The charity Bliss said it had been alerted to issues around isolation guidance at other trusts. The chief executive, Carline Lee-Davey, told the Observer: “In recent months we have heard of a number of cases where hospitals have told Covid-positive mothers to isolate for longer than current guidance sets out, with examples of inconsistent rules applied and unclear communication to parents. “Where a baby is admitted to neonatal care, the first priority must be to facilitate as early contact as possible between a baby and their parents, given how important this is to the baby’s health and the family’s bonding and attachment. It is vital rules are communicated clearly to parents, and are in line with latest guidance.” A UCLH trust spokesperson said: “We are very sorry for the distress caused to our two mums at the birth of their babies. This should have been a joyful time of human contact and closeness and our isolation rules did not make this possible. “We know safety needs to be balanced with compassion and we believe our staff have always done their best in very difficult circumstances. We recognise, however, that as an organisation, we have not always got the balance right. “We have now updated our isolation policy for maternity patients in line with national guidelines and we have invited the mums to meet with us so we can understand if any further lessons can be learned.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Mothers and newborns kept apart unnecessarily in hospital due to Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/20/mothers-and-newborns-kept-apart-unnecessarily-in-hospital-due-to-covid
2/20/2022,"If Ken McElroy gets his way, a very unusual feature will soon be added to the wild Caithness landscape at the northern edge of mainland Britain. He plans to re-create a 50ft-high iron age “skyscraper”, known as a broch, one of the most intriguing and mysterious types of building ever constructed in the British Isles. The elaborately built, drystone structures stood several storeys high and were erected only in Scotland, with hundreds being constructed between 600BC and AD100. The identities of the people who built them remain a mystery.  Nor is it understood what purpose lay behind the building of these huge windowless structures, which would have loomed over the local landscape and been visible for miles. Some historians have suggested they were built as refuges for local people seeking shelter from Roman slave ships. However, this idea is controversial and is rejected by other researchers, who argue that they were erected by people who wanted to show off their power and status. Only one relatively intact broch remains in existence today, on the tiny island of Mousa, now uninhabited, in Shetland. McElroy – a director of the Caithness Broch Project – plans to create a completely new version, using traditional techniques, including construction methods such as drystone walling. “Brochs are pinnacles of prehistoric architecture,” he argues. “They were several storeys high but were built without cement, and that is a remarkable achievement on its own. While the rest of Britain was living in low-level roundhouses and the like, these iron-age skyscrapers were being built all around Scotland. “It is also important to note that Caithness has a higher concentration of broch sites than any other area in Scotland – and that makes the region the best place to tell the distinctive story behind these remarkable buildings.” Most brochs have imposing walls that were often three metres thick, and which were double lined with spiral staircases running between their inner and outer lining. They would probably also have had wooden roofs, a central door and other features. “They were incredibly sophisticated structures for their time,” adds McElroy, a self-confessed “broch-bragger” who has been promoting the cause of these strange structures for years. He highlights three key motives for building Scotland’s first new broch in 2,000 years. “We are still in the dark about the reasons for constructing brochs. However, in learning how to build one, we should get a better idea about why they were constructed,” he says. In addition, it is hoped that the construction project will help preserve local skills – in drystone wall building, for example – while it should also create a tourist attraction for Caithness. “The region faces a real problem in terms of the population decline that is predicted for the coming decade. This could reach 20%, and that would have a pretty grim impact. “We need to provide reasons for people to come here, and the broch project should play a key role in boosting tourism and employment,” he adds. McElroy – who co-founded the Caithness Broch Project with fellow archaeologist Iain Maclean – likened the broch scheme to the construction of Guédelon Castle, which is currently taking place near Treigny, France, with the aim of recreating a 13th-century castle using period techniques, dress and materials. “Like Guédelon, the Caithness broch would be a focus of interest while it was being built and also a place to visit once it had been completed.” The first brochs were constructed more than 2,500 years ago at the end of the bronze age and the beginning of the iron age in Britain. “The climate began to get a bit cooler around 900BC and the struggle for resources would have got harder,” says McElroy. “Tribes and bands of people began teaming up, leading to the formation of kingdoms as the iron age went on. “I think brochs reflect these changes in which expanding groups wanted to show off their power, and they did that through constructing these highly sophisticated buildings. They were status symbols.” The Caithness Broch Project began operations several years ago and is now closing in on a construction site that McElroy and his colleagues hope to buy before the end of the year. It is estimated that it will then take at least three or four more years to build the broch with money coming from the Heritage Lottery Fund, crowdfunding and other sources to enable the building of the £1m-£3m structure. The project certainly offers an intriguing vision of the future at the very northern tip of the British mainland. Other efforts being made in the area to provide skilled jobs for the region include the Sutherland spaceport, which is now under construction on the A’ Mhòine peninsula. It hopes to begin launching satellites next year. The juxtaposition of recreating ancient buildings while putting probes into space in these neighbouring remote counties suggests an intriguingly rich mix of attractions for the region. “Rockets and brochs. It just sounds like a lovely combination,” says McElroy. “Who would not be attracted by that?”",News/UK news,New Caithness broch will reach 50 feet and follow plans devised in 600BC,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/20/new-caithness-broch-will-reach-50-feet-and-follow-plans-devised-in-600bc
2/20/2022,"Idon’t normally take much interest in planning applications, appeals and disputes, but one that is local to me piqued my curiosity as it involves a burning issue, literally. This is the application by the waste management company Veolia to build an incinerator not too far from Jane Austen’s house at Chawton. Given that it is in an area of breathtaking countryside and despite objections from Alan Titchmarsh, CPRE Hampshire, the South Downs National Park Authority and Historic England, among others, the authorities appear to be giving it the go-ahead. What particularly caught my eye was the following: “But despite this overwhelming opposition, the report states the proposal will ‘allow residual waste, which cannot be reused or recycled, to be managed at the most reasonable level of the waste hierarchy, diverting it from landfill’.”  Excuse me - the waste hierarchy? I would dearly love to hear an explanation from Veolia or Hampshire county council as to what this means exactly, otherwise I think that the application should be thrown out on the grounds that it contains elements that are an offence against the English language. Now, how do you normally buy your clothes? I imagine physically or online. Oh please, do get up to speed. Read the following breathless press release: “Designer fashion has been merged even further with the metaverse with the world’s first ever Metaverse Fashion Week, which began yesterday. Being accessible to all, fundamentally sustainable and catering easily to the constant churn of new trends is something which the physical world is unable to do: the metaverse is the future.” I wrote last week about the metaverse and the dangers that can befall you while wearing VR headsets or staring at the computer screen. This now adds to the confusion. Do you own the clothes? Do they actually exist? It’s all very confusing. I think I’ll go back to the altogether simpler world of planning applications.  Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist",News/From the Observer,May I have a word about… the planned incinerator near Jane Austen’s house | Jonathan Bouquet,https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/may-i-have-a-word-about
2/20/2022,"Father and daughter chef duo James and Georgia Sommerin are so in sync that they can communicate with one another using only eye contact. So impressive is their serenity while working in the open kitchen of their family-run restaurant in Penarth, Wales – appropriately named Home – that people get “mesmerised” watching them, said James Sommerin, 43. He describes his daughter, 23, as “my right hand”. “We don’t necessarily have to talk to each other,” he said. “It’s literally a look. She knows that I’ve got her back 110% and vice versa.”  Last week, less than six months after opening, the restaurant celebrated a landmark moment when it was awarded its first Michelin star. It was one of three British establishments awarded a first star to be run entirely by family members – not an easy feat in an industry known for its workload and stress levels. Two other restaurants in London – Evelyn’s Table, run by three brothers, and Sollip, run by a husband and wife – were recognised for the first time by this year’s guide. And at a time of turmoil for the industry, all represent rare success stories, having opened since the start of the pandemic. “The pandemic made people realise what was important to them and encouraged them to follow their dreams – and, for many, that was to spend more time with the ones they care about most,” a Michelin spokesperson said, adding that family-run kitchens are often “calmer, quieter places, where everyone works in harmony”. Home, the guide notes, is “staffed almost exclusively by family members”. Their small team of six includes James’s wife, Louise, who leads the front-of-house team, which also includes their daughter Angharad (they also have an 11-year-old daughter, Elin) and Louise’s twin sister Cath. Their “surprise” menu is seasonal and uses locally sourced produce. While this is not Sommerin’s first Michelin star – he previously had one at his former restaurant in Penarth, which was forced to close due to the pandemic, and at the Crown at Whitebrook, where he was head chef – this one feels different. “It’s more special than it ever was before,” he said. “Just purely because it’s us as a unit, there are no other investors, no business partners, no nothing. We are running it solely and it’s such a huge achievement.” It was a worrying time to open a business, in the teeth of the pandemic – at the height of which the family prepared meals for NHS staff – and having gone through “excruciating pain” with the closure of James’s previous business. But they decided to take things slowly with Home, which seats 24. So far it has been a huge success. He couldn’t have done it without Georgia, he said, adding that the star is as much hers as it his. Describing her as one of his best friends, he said “we work exceptionally well together”. They draw inspiration from Spanish father-and-daughter partnership Juan Mari and Elena Arzak, whom they met when they ate at their renowned three-starred restaurant in San Sebastián. “Is she a daddy’s girl? I don’t know. I treat her like a mate to an extent. She’s my daughter, I’m there to protect her, but also I’m there to nurture her as well.” Georgia, who is the restaurant’s sous chef, has earned recognition in her own right. In 2020, aged just 20, she became the youngest competitor on the BBC’s Great British Menu. Now, to be awarded a Michelin star at such a young age, she says, is “like winning an Oscar”: “To be on the map as one of those top-end fine dining restaurants in the UK is amazing.” She first started cooking with her father when she was 13, making Welsh cakes on Saturdays at the Crown. After leaving school at 16, she briefly tried college but decided she would prefer to work with him. “The rest is history really. I never looked back to do anything else.” Her parents live in Penarth, while she now lives in nearby Barry. She loves all areas of cooking but has a soft spot for pastry. “Me and my dad, we split each section equally, so I do a bit of cooking, of sauce and garnish, and then he does a bit and we share the job.” Next, she is hoping for two stars. “It’s just keep doing what we’re doing and pushing forwards.” In London, brothers Luke, Theo and Nathaniel Selby not only won a Michelin star for their work at Evelyn’s Table at the Blue Posts in Chinatown but also got a special award for best young chefs. The brothers, who have been serving food that combines French and Japanese techniques at the 12-seat restaurant since October 2020, have been working in kitchens together for over a decade. Head chef Luke, 31, said they were “all super happy and very emotional”, and he plans to take Theo, 29, and Nathaniel, 27, to celebrate on Sunday – first by visiting Raymond Blanc at Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons in Oxford, where they all used to work, and then with lunch at Alain Roux’s Waterside Inn in Bray. “We close the restaurant on Sunday and Monday so we’re looking forward to being able to celebrate properly together then as a family.” He said the brothers have an “amazing dynamic” and that he couldn’t have done it without them, adding: “We have an amazing synergy in the kitchen. Not only that they’re my brothers, but we’ve also worked together for a very long time.” Their passion for fresh produce started at a young age, when they went foraging with their mother, who is from the Philippines, around Steyning, West Sussex, where they grew up. “She was foraging with us, picking blackberries, fishing, so we had an appreciation of nature, ingredients and produce and where it came from a very early age,” he said. At 18, he left home to train at Le Manoir. Three years later, Theo came, followed by Nathaniel the following year. “That’s where we really started working together. I was the sous chef and they were both commis chefs, so it was an interesting dynamic being their boss and their brother as well.” Now, while Luke is officially in charge, he says they are equals in the kitchen and all create their own dishes. They plan to continue refining and improving their work, and in the long term would like to start their own self-financed venture together. Despite the pandemic, he said the industry had “bounced back” and that they had been overwhelmed with support. “It’s an incredible time. The future’s bright and it’s an amazing industry to be part of.” Three miles away from Evelyn’s Table, husband and wife Woongchul Park, 37, and Bomee Ki, 34, had planned to open their first restaurant, Sollip, in March 2020 after moving to London from South Korea, but due to lockdowns were delayed until August. The opening was, Park said, “the biggest challenge of my life”. Having sold everything in Korea, they moved with their children, aged seven and five, and then had to face the pandemic. When they found out Sollip had been awarded a Michelin star last week, Park was elated but lost for words. Their restaurant, near London Bridge, combines European and French styles with Korean techniques and ingredients, and was described by Michelin as “polished and poised”. He would like to use it to introduce more people to Korean food and culture. “If you go to New York or other global cities, there are so many good Korean restaurants and lots of Korean people and Korean chefs. But here in London there aren’t many.” The couple met in 2010 at Le Cordon Bleu London, where they both trained, but did not become a couple until 2012, getting married the following year. Park puts their success down to Ki’s perfectionism and their ability to share ideas. While he said his standards were high, hers were even higher: “I believe in her 100% as a pastry chef and so there’s nothing really to argue about in the kitchen.”",Lifestyle/Food,Home cooking: the British families who are winning Michelin stars,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/20/home-cooking-the-british-families-who-are-winning-michelin-stars
2/20/2022,"Did you know the UK government had a Flickr account? A fast-moving succession of unexplained photographs create an impression that things involving Tory politicians are happening, at a very high level, and at some speed, but offer no explanation of what they mean. It is perfect – the taxpayer-funded, vanity-engineered photo-diary of a group of globe-trotting lightweights, hopelessly out of their depth, the subject of international ridicule and domestic contempt, making the sort of shapes and faces they imagine appear significant. Arrive in conference room holding document. Wear face mask at railway station. Gesture towards thing. Don helmet near scaffolding. Laugh with peasant. Concerned expression. Hi-vis jacket. Hat. I’m filing this column 36 hours early. I have been able to snap up a holiday abandoned last week by a politician keen to be seen as taking Ukraine seriously, in a PR move already known as the Reverse Raab. (Indeed, it is rumoured that some politicians who weren’t actually on holiday quickly arranged one so they could be seen to return from it.) By the time you read these words they will be five days old and anything could have happened. Madness. Madness. War.  In the past two weeks our horse-heating apology-doormat education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, has argued about his leader’s obvious dishonesty with some small schoolchildren who found out about it on Newsround; the police are suddenly Dickless; and, in an act of heroic hypocrisy, the tonally inconsistent comedian Jimmy Carr was condemned as “deeply disturbing” for his Holocaust material by the prime minister, Boris Piccaninny-Watermelon Muslim-Letterbox Tank-Topped-Bumboys Romanian-Vampires Cocaine-Event Spiritual-Worth Gay-Marriage-Three-Men-and-a-Dog Jimmy-Savile Wallpaper Johnson, who is presumably an expert in the area of monetised, attention-grabbing offence. Newspaper columnist satirists’ attempts to make jokes about current events are like trying to nail eels to a curtain. The curtain is ruined and the eels die. As I begin this column it’s Sunday 13 February and last time I looked at UK government Flickr it was mid-afternoon and Liz Truss was standing with her mouth open in front of a tapestry of some lakes while Sergei Lavrov scratched his head, like an itchy chimp, and who can blame him? Now it’s 6am on Monday and defence secretary Ben Wallace is making a gesture of judgmental evaluation towards a fur-covered microphone, as if accusing someone at the British embassy in Moscow of attempting to mock him by providing it. Was this where he diplomatically brought up appeasing Hitler, in a place that lost 27 million people in the second world war? The irony is, if Wallace was able to get round the table with Putin he would find they have much common ground – a homophobic opposition to gay rights, a fondness for the dark art of the groundless political smear, and early onset baldness – but the UK government Flickr account has instead given the impression that Wallace is talking tough with some furry audio equipment. I scroll back five days to the famous Liz Truss fur hat fiasco. There’s the foreign secretary framed by a wooden doorway, against a backdrop of serious Soviet architecture, looking like a bit-player in the sort of 80s espionage drama where Alexei Sayle would steal the show as a KGB pastry chef; the notorious Red Square fur hat sequence portrays Truss as a contemplative loner cutting her be-hatted swathe through the diplomatic landscape, trailed only, presumably, by her photographer, her makeup person, her stylist, her milliner, some Peta protesters, and one of those men who hold those big circles of silver foil. A day earlier, we see Michael Gove, on a “Levelling Up Visit to Birkenhead and Liverpool”, the latter city one Margaret Thatcher’s government notoriously wanted to put into “managed decline”. There’s a thin blue line between levelling up a red wall seat and simply levelling it. As Gove passes a hair salon, the awkward obscuring of an aide’s grey bonce behind his raised fist makes it look as if the secretary of state for levelling up is addressing a small furry rodent, asleep in his hand. “Nosey Nip gives me all my policy advice. He lives in a tin in my anorak.” On 3 February, transport secretary Grant Shapps and Michael Portillo, the Cuprinol Wood Goblin, are on a bench at Marylebone station laughing uproariously at an immediately discredited railway policy announcement. In all four shots a delighted Portillo models a bright purple blazer, but Shapps’s stylist has given him a bright red blazer for two shots, and a black one for the others. Or perhaps black blazer Shapps is the real Shapps, while red blazer Shapps is Michael Green, Corinne Stockheath or Sebastian Fox, the pseudonymous identities under which Shapps shepherded dodgy get-rich-quick schemes. At Hammersmith academy, on 6 January, stallion-snuggler Zahawi makes menacing claw-like gestures towards a year 7 Newsround viewer soon to become his chief ideological opponent. And on Monday, former culture secretary Sajid Javid visits Willows care home, and calls two elderly Michael Bublé ticket holders, who paid five times over the odds, “chattering middle-class champagne socialists who have no interest in helping the common working man earn a decent living by acting as a middleman”. Lacking context and looking cynically stage-managed, the UK government’s Flickr photographs can be made to tell almost any story, surely a gift to those endlessly creative members of the public who manufacture the satirical memes that delight us daily. Michael Gove is alone on a windswept pier; Steve Barclay stands in front of a projected slide headed “Arp Spoofing”; Liz Truss jogs at speed over Brooklyn Bridge, but cannot outrun the judgment of history. UK government Flickr has given you the tools, internet mischief makers. Now do your work. On the other hand, why bother?

2/20/2022,"Talking to Dr Becky Kennedy today requires flexibility – the kind of flexibility that many of us parents have had to hone pretty well during the pandemic. My five-year-old daughter is off from school with her first bout of Covid, which means I have to take Kennedy’s Zoom call from the bedroom. Kennedy’s own seven-year-old daughter is also at home with a fever and sore throat; luckily her husband has stepped in to help oversee childcare, so she’s got an hour to speak. The slapdash situation feels apt: Kennedy, a clinical psychologist from New York who specialises in parenting, experienced a rapid rise to prominence during the pandemic when young parents suddenly found themselves at home with their children and in desperate need for a hand to guide them through it. Kennedy had never even posted on Instagram when Covid-19 first emerged, but on 28 March 2020, two days after lockdown measures came into force in the UK, she wrote a message to her 200 followers that changed her life. It read: “Most young kids will remember how their family home felt during the coronavirus panic more than anything specific about the virus. Our kids are watching us and learning about how to respond to stress and uncertainty. Let’s wire our kids for resilience, not panic. How? Scroll for some tips.”  The post went viral. Dr Becky (as she is known online) and her company Good Inside now has 1m followers, a hit podcast, a series of paid-for workshops covering everything from potty training to anxious kids, and a legion of devoted followers located everywhere from Jordan to Guatemala via Australia and the UK. This year she has a book out and big plans for a membership platform that she hopes can become, as she puts it, a “Peloton for parents” – a community hub packed with educational tools. Kennedy talks about what she does as becoming a “movement”, an empathic, relationship-centric approach to parenting that is attracting a whole new generation of mums and dads to the cause. It’s not for nothing that Time magazine called her the “Millennial parent whisperer”. “Yeah, I’ve got that tattooed on my arm,” she says laughing from her Manhattan office. “No, no, I definitely do not!” In fact, Kennedy is not big on any kind of labels. Her focus on parenting arose from when she worked on long-term therapy with adults and realised some people were being needlessly diagnosed with disorders for patterns they had wired into their bodies during childhood as they learned to adapt to their family system. Kennedy wondered if we could intervene earlier, so that children could build resilience and learn to adapt not just to their own family system but in the future as adults, too – “Rather than having to unwire and rewire themselves back again in adulthood,” she says. Five months after she’d had her first of three children (a boy, now 10; she also has a boy, aged four), Kennedy opened her private practice aimed at doing just that. During our hour-long chat it is clear why Kennedy is so popular: she’s friendly, funny and speaks with clarity, summing up complex theoretical ideas in relatable terms. She believes in focusing on the parent rather than the child – transforming them into “sturdy leaders” who experience their own growth and healing along the way. The parent is invited to examine how they respond to their child’s tantrums and deep feelings – do they deny them (“Oh, don’t be silly!”), distract them (“Oh, look, a bus!”) or feel guilty? Or do they validate them and discuss them openly and respectfully (“I can see you’re feeling really sad – let’s talk about why.”) Kids aren’t afraid of feelings, she says, but of feeling alone in those feelings. She likes parents to put themselves in the position of their children and imagine how they might feel. She talks about a time she played a short game with her own daughter where the child got to set the rules. Her daughter asked her to change into clothes she didn’t like shortly before Kennedy had to leave the house for work and she realised it made her bristle with resentment – if she felt like that, then why wouldn’t a child? As a child growing up in Westchester County, New York, Kennedy was a perfectionist who thrived on being the good girl, the people pleaser, the high achiever. This pressure to be good is what she believes contributed to a “brief but intense” experience with anorexia as a teenager. She found therapy rewarding and the experience had the added benefit of suggesting a career path: “Understanding people’s stories, unlocking things… Therapy can change the course of people’s lives. I know because it did with mine.” At first, Kennedy studied and applied the behavioural method of parenting favoured by previous generations – changing behaviour using naughty steps and reward charts felt logical and it seemed to get quick results. But she remembers sitting in her office with a set of parents, telling them how to implement a time-out, and thinking: “This feels wrong, I wouldn’t do this with my own kids.” She became suspicious of the whole approach. “The way I think about behaviour now is that it’s the tip of the iceberg,” she says. “It’s important because you need to see the tip to understand what’s underneath. But if I cut off the tip I don’t think anybody would say you’re suddenly safer on your ship – in fact, the waters would now be more dangerous.” A later session, with parents of a 14-year-old boy who was rebelling after years of being sticker-charted into behaving well, confirmed her change of heart. “He basically said: ‘I don’t fucking care about your stickers and you can’t physically move me and put me in a time-out any more. You don’t understand me, you don’t try to understand me, you’ve been more interested in shaping my behaviour than helping me grow up as a human being and now we have nothing.’ I could actually cry thinking about it, but that case showed me that it’s also truly never too late to change.” Kennedy’s Instagram has a wealth of snappy information on it. A typical post might say: “Three Things To Say When Your Child Is Hesitant” or “Common Parenting Myth: If I Take Care Of Myself Rather Than Spend Time With My Children, I’m Selfish.” There are multiple to-camera clips to watch, digestible in a minute or so. In terms of translating deep ideas into social media nuggets for time-starved parents to consume in spare moments, Kennedy seems to have aced the market. But is it possible to come away with meaningful change from such short snippets? Parental advice for previous generations involved consuming huge tomes, such as Dr Benjamin Spock’s 1946 book The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care (527 pages) or 1983’s The Baby Book (783 pages). But then that relied on people actually reading them. I found the accessibility of Kennedy’s advice a great starting place to consider her ideas – and she frequently directs you to her podcasts and workshops if you wish to investigate further. Dr Becky also offers advice that is targeted at the unique problems millennial parents face, reframing some of the stereotypes we’ve become used to hearing in the media: that they’re snowflakes, suffer from a sense of entitlement and are glued to their devices. “Younger parents experience a lot of guilt,” she says, which is not only a problem for building sturdy leaders, but also misplaced: a 2016 study by the University of California, Irvine, found that both mums and dads spend significantly more time with their children than their 1960s counterparts: mums moved up from 54 average daily minutes on child care activities in 1965 to 104 minutes in 2012; dads moved up to 59 minutes from a whopping 16 minutes in the 60s. Kennedy also points to the pressures of social media, which invites comparisons to unrealistic scenes of perfect parenting and offers continuous opportunities for external validation from likes and comments. “It’s so easy to define yourself by the information others give you, rather than from what’s going on inside you,” she says. “And if you apply that to parenting then your child becomes the latest barometer of whether or not you’re a good person. So if they have a meltdown in the playground, you must be a horrible parent because they’re not giving you an Instagram perfect video. Whereas I want parents to think, yes my child is tantrumming, but I feel confident about my intervention.” This notion of internal and external validation applies to children, too, and Kennedy warns against something some of us softer parents might find counterintuitive: over-praising. “We think, great, that will build them up. But if that’s true, the opposite is true too when they hear something less nice.” Instead of saying, “You were amazing at soccer today,” she suggests asking questions (“Who crossed the ball to you when you scored?”) or focusing on how the experience made the child feel (“I could see how happy scoring made you.”) Partly, this comes from her own upbringing: Kennedy has a close relationship with her parents, but wonders if maybe they could have framed their praise in different ways. “I needed more permission to struggle. To not be so good,” she says. Analysing our own upbringings and identifying things that worked or didn’t work is an important part of Kennedy’s approach. I tell her about a vivid memory I have from childhood, of overhearing a conversation about Ronald Reagan “pressing the button” and descending into uncontrollable tears when my parents explained what nuclear war was. My devastation was met with a mixture of bemusement and panicked attempts to reassure me, neither of which, I now realise, were validating the extreme feelings I was having. I ask Kennedy how I might go about telling my own children about the difficult things of our era, such as climate change. “What you’re talking about is how we talk to our kids about hard truths,” she says. There are no set rules. “It’s not like at two you say this and at five you say this. It’s more… Where is my kid now in terms of talking about uncomfortable truths?” She points to the example of a family who might steer their children away from a rough sleeper to avoid talking about homelessness. Or how another parent might argue with their partner, but then say to their child afterwards, “You heard us argue and that probably felt scary, here’s what was going on.” The second child is likely to be more emotionally prepared to talk about bigger things such as climate change because they have built up skills to deal with hard truths. “So there’s not a sex talk, a racism talk, a climate talk… You start them off, tell them you will check in and they can talk about these important topics. This also sets the stage for how you get your teenager to talk to you rather than hide things. Because that doesn’t just happen in adolescence.” A few days later I speak to Carolyn Ismach, 36, a speech and language pathologist from New Jersey with two children: a girl aged five and a son who is three. She had been following a variety of “positive parenting” sites, but found their lack of concrete examples frustrating. Kennedy’s material seemed different: while emphasising a positive approach, it also contained specific steps that Ismach could take out into the real world. “Within a week, I’d pretty much abandoned the other accounts and relied solely on Dr Becky,” she says. Ismach has called on Kennedy’s sleep workshop and her podcasts for advice (“I can’t tell you how many times I’ve listened to the callers and thought, ‘Wow, I could have called in with that exact question, I’m not alone here.’”). And she credits Kennedy’s “Back to School” workshop with helping her daughter adapt to a new school environment after months away. “She walked into her first day back with zero hesitation and, even better, I felt fully confident in myself as a parent.” These stories aren’t uncommon. Yet Kennedy has faced criticism, too, namely that what she’s selling is the unattainable notion that it’s possible to “win” at parenting. To some degree, she says, she can understand where that comes from. “It’s one more way to feel not enough, right? I didn’t listen to the whole podcast, or do the latest workshop. But I think two things can be true: I am doing enough and there is more I could learn.” Still, she thinks her aims have been misrepresented: “I don’t say you can ‘win’ at parenting, in terms of controlling your kids’ behaviour or having picture-perfect moments. If a win exists, then it’s parents having more clarity and internal confidence even in the hard moments.” Regardless of criticisms, it’s hard to disagree that a sea change is happening regarding how parents build relationships with their children. The Observer’s agony aunt Philippa Perry is the author of 2019’s The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read (And Your Children Will Be Glad That You Did), which shares similar ideas to Kennedy’s about establishing a respectful bond between adults and children, and emerged from a similar place. “I wrote my book after decades of seeing patients whose parents were perfectly nice, yet believed it was in their child’s best interests to deny rather than validate their child’s unhappy feelings,” she says. “Parents who did not realise you cannot scold a child out of being sensitive and thought they were doing the best thing when they attempted this.” She adds: “If you can’t create a safe, harmonious home environment where differences of opinion and cultures can be worked through safely, then you might need to self-examine a bit.” If such ideas are set to mark a permanent shift in how we parent, then Kennedy is seizing it. Later this year sees the release of her book Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be. And for her membership scheme she has devised a platform to provide a library of information to a community of like-minded mums and (hopefully) dads, too – her Instagram followers are currently 94% female. She has also just finished training her first cohort of therapists in the Dr Becky method and they will populate the community, too, offering advice and support. But if her fame continues to grow will it put pressure on her own parenting style? She laughs: “I get asked a lot, so are your kids perfect? No! That would be the opposite of my approach. And also, for anyone who needs to hear this – I yell at my kids sometimes, I find myself saying, ‘OK just do this and you can have an M&M,’ I get distracted by my phone when I’m supposed to be playing with them. If knowing that helps knock me off some kind of pedestal then that’s a win for everyone. Because at the end of the day we’re all human and parenting is hard – and that’s true for me, too!” Visit goodinside.com for Dr Becky’s podcast, workshops, and to sign up for her Good Insider newsletter",Lifestyle/Life and style,How Dr Becky Kennedy became Instagram’s favourite ‘parent whisperer’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/20/how-dr-becky-kennedy-became-instagrams-favourite-parent-whisperer-
2/20/2022,"Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, is backing a controversial proposal to strip $200m in education funding from Democratic counties that defied his executive order last year banning mask mandates in schools. DeSantis, who is widely seen as a leading heir to Donald Trump in the Republican party, plans to send the money instead to mostly Republican counties that supported him.  The plan, which some analysts believe is almost certainly unconstitutional, was part of a budget bill that passed the Republican-dominated Florida house on Wednesday. It was immediately attacked by teachers unions, school districts and education advocates, who say the penalties will strip further resources from classrooms in a state already in the bottom four of per-student spending nationally. “This is retaliation by legislators and the governor,” said Jabari Hosey, president of the advocacy group Families for Safe Schools and a parent of school-age children in Brevard county. “We are down over 150 teachers in Brevard right now. We need more social workers, there’s a performance gap because of Covid that is still present in our community. We need more funds, more opportunities, more instructors. “To retaliate and to attack the public school system they are supposed to be promoting is very sad. Frankly, it’s embarrassing.” Under the proposal by the Republican state congressman Randy Fine, school districts in the 12 Florida counties that implemented mask mandates last summer in defiance of DeSantis’s executive order will forfeit amounts based on their size. Brevard, where Hosey’s children attend school, and which Fine represents, would forgo $4.5m. Two-thirds of the money would come from south Florida, which votes overwhelmingly Democratic in local, state and national elections. Miami-Dade, the nation’s fourth largest district with 357,000 students, would lose $72m; Broward, the sixth largest with 270,000 students, would forfeit about $32m; and Palm Beach, the 10th largest with 193,000 would give up $28m. Of the others, Alachua, Duval, Hillsborough, Indian River, Leon, Orange, Sarasota and Volusia counties, all but three backed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election in Florida, which was won by Donald Trump. “Following the law is not optional. These school districts broke the law, and they were broken for nothing,” a visibly angry Fine told fellow legislators on Wednesday. He insisted during a turbulent session of the Florida house appropriations committee last week that the state would cut the salaries of administrators earning more than $100,000 and not “reduce funding for any direct educational service or resource that impacts the education of kindergarten through grade 12 students”. He conceded, however, that the policy was intentionally punitive to counties who refused to fall in line with the governor. “It is intended to reward the 55 school districts, the overwhelming majority of which followed our state law and respected the rights of parents over the past year,” he said. Initially, DeSantis, a fierce critic of mask and vaccine mandates, declared himself against the proposal. “My view would be let’s not do that,” he said in an appearance in Jacksonville on Friday, telling reporters he instead preferred to let parents sue school districts individually if they felt children were harmed by “forced masking”. By Tuesday, however, the governor backtracked, supporting Fine’s initiative and parents’ rights to file lawsuits. “They should get compensated for academic, social and emotional problems caused by these policies,” he said in a tweet. Having passed the Florida house, the $105bn budget that includes the redistribution of education funds must now be reconciled in the state senate, which also has a Republican majority. If DeSantis eventually signs it into law, it is likely to face legal challenges. Hosey’s group points out that every Florida county with mandates dropped them as soon as the original executive order became law in November, following a lengthy legal back and forth with districts who insisted they followed advice on masking from the Biden administration and federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Additionally, they say, the fines target the salaries of school district administrators who only implemented the mask policies, not the school board members who set them. John J Sullivan, director of legislative affairs for Broward county public schools, told the Guardian in a statement that students would be directly affected by the withholding of funds. “We are disappointed in the governor’s reversal. We hope the senate will not agree to penalize administrators who have worked tirelessly to meet the unprecedented challenges caused by the pandemic, always focused on the health and safety of students and teachers,” he said. “This penalty would have a negative impact on the services the district is able to provide to our students.” Administrators in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties have issued similar statements, and educators’ unions have condemned the plan. “We have 165 vacancies and a lot of it has to do with the salaries we can offer to teachers. So that money would mean a lot to our school district and it’s a shame that someone would do that. It’s totally punitive and politically motivated,” Wendy Doromal, president of the Orange county classroom teachers association told WMFE radio.",News/US news,Florida governor: school districts that defied no-mask mandate to lose $200m ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/20/florida-ron-desantis-schools-mask-mandates-funding-covid
2/20/2022,"One in five nearly-new cars are now selling at more than their brand-new equivalents, as disruption to supply chains continues to push used cars to record values. The closure of forecourts because of Covid and an ongoing shortage of semiconductors are the main forces behind a major mismatch of supply and demand, which has been worsening over the last few months. The average price of a used car on Auto Trader’s marketplace has increased 29% over the last year, according to its latest figures. Average prices are up more than £4,200 in just six months.  The bizarre spectacle of nearly-new cars selling for more than their brand-new price has been fuelled by buyers having to join long waiting lists for new cars, prompting them to head to the secondhand market. Nearly-new cars are those up to a year old. Among those selling above their brand-new price are models of the Smart Forfour, the Toyota RAV4 and the Volkswagen Tiguan. It comes with the entire used-car market seeing record prices. Of the 10 models that saw the least price growth since the start of last February, only the bottom three models actually saw a drop in price on Auto Trader’s site. The average price for a car on its site is more than £20,000 and has increased for 93 consecutive weeks. Ian Plummer, Auto Trader’s commercial director, said that there was little prospect of a swift “bubble-bursting moment” that would see second-hand prices return to lower levels. “In terms of new cars, we estimate that probably about a million and a half cars fewer were sold in the two years of 2020 and 2021,” he said. “I think the market will still be half a million or so shorter than it would ordinarily be this year. On top of that, more generally, there is a huge appetite for car ownership. “Supply and demand are simultaneously swinging quite dramatically away from each other. I’m sure this will narrow over time, but it doesn’t feel like there’s going to be radical changes in either metric very quickly.” The number of used cars exceeding the price of their brand-new versions is not limited to the UK. Manufacturers, including Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota, have all recently said that they are still struggling to deal with the impact of the semiconductor shortage hitting production targets.",News/Business,One in five secondhand cars in UK cost more than new models,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/20/one-in-five-secondhand-cars-in-uk-cost-more-than-new-models

2/20/2022,"Standing in the hospital room where she gave birth to her first child, Rosemonde Bertin looked around in despair. The roof had collapsed, trees grew through the floor and a rusting, enamelled bedpan lay half concealed by ferns. “I had my baby here,” Bertin said. “He was born in 1972.” That was shortly before everyone on Salomon atoll was forcibly deported by the British to Mauritius and Seychelles.  Beside the hospital stood St Bridget’s chapel. Creepers and roots penetrated the walls; decaying coconuts littered the floor. Two coloured glass panes remained in one window but the roof had disappeared. Orange and black, coconut crabs lurked in crevices. “My church is abandoned,” wailed Bertin, 67. “I was baptised here. I made my first communion here. All the families came to church every Sunday.” On a previous occasion, escorted by British officials on a “heritage” visit, she had not been able to explore her former community. This time she had returned on a Mauritian-chartered cruise ship. “Now I feel I can show you around,” she said. A torrential downpour, frequent in the afternoons once the equatorial sun heats the seas around the Chagos Islands, required 10 minutes’ shelter under the trees Down a sodden track through overgrown coconut palms, Bertin led the way to the island’s cemetery. Predatory frigate birds drifted overhead. Graves were covered in moss with few legible inscriptions. Rusting iron rails surrounded a few tombs. The temporary return of exiled Chagossians, however, was not the only narrative being played out during the five-day visit this week. Mauritian officials planted their national flag on Salomon, Peros Banhos atoll and even a sandbank that emerged on a low spring tide at Blenheim reef on the northernmost edge of the archipelago. The national anthem was sung and a statement broadcast by the prime minister, Pravind Jugnauth, celebrating Mauritian sovereignty. A metal plaque, recording that the islands are inalienably part of Mauritius, was cemented into place. As the Bleu De Nîmes, hired by Mauritius for its first formal expedition to the archipelago, sailed away, Britain’s control over what it terms British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) appeared significantly weakened. The formal challenge to UK sovereignty was initially met by Whitehall evasion: the presence of a foreign survey vessel in territorial waters explained as cooperation with a “scientific survey”. But the distrust lurking behind diplomatic niceties was evident in the presence of a British fisheries protection vessel, Grampian Frontier, which shadowed the Bleu De Nîmes, keeping a constant distance. In the face of Mauritian allegations of “crimes against humanity”, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) eventually reasserted UK sovereignty and pointed to grants made to Chagossian exiles. It also denied interfering with the cruise ship’s wifi, which mysteriously failed. But the legal balance shifted decisively in favour of Mauritian arguments for sovereignty after decisions at the international court of justice, the UN general assembly and the international tribunal of the law of the sea (Itlos) in 2019 and last year. The UK was found to have unlawfully separated the Chagos Islands from Mauritius before it granted independence in 1968. This week’s visit was the logical consequence of Mauritius seeking to enforce that internationally ratified authority. The government in Port Louis is now contemplating further legal action to enforce the Itlos ruling. The Mauritian ambassador to the United Nations, Jagdish Koonjul, led the expedition. It had accomplished four objectives, he said. “We completed the survey on Blenheim reef [for a forthcoming ITLOS hearing]. We brought Chagossians back to the islands where they were born. “We were able to exercise our sovereignty, raising the flag of Mauritius as we were travelling through the northernmost part of our territory. And we have [explained] to the world [through the media] all the lies and deceits hidden for so long by certain powers.” The UK justifies its refusal to hand back the territory to Mauritius by pointing out that the initial ICJ judgment, on which other decisions relied, was advisory not binding. Back in Salomon and Peros Banhos, wandering through derelict homes, it is difficult to understand why the UK should have abandoned such strategic settlements. The Chagossians’ ancestors may have been transported as enslaved people from Africa by the first, French, colonial overseers, but their freed descendants had established thriving communities that survived by trading coconut oil. Neighbouring Maldives now hosts a lucrative tourist industry. The Americans, who rent a strategic military base from the UK on another island, Diego Garcia, supported the mass deportations in the early 1970s. The main rationale for evacuation, however, was the consequence of a 1960 UN resolution on the right of self-determination: the UK realised it could only establish a new colony, the British Indian Ocean Territory, if no one lived there. Ever since, the plight of the exiled Chagossians has been the emotional battleground over which legitimacy of ownership has been fought. They UK, by forcibly deporting them, denying them UK citizenship, preventing them from returning, and insulting them in FCO memorandums (where they were dismissed as “Men Fridays”), has repeatedly forfeited international sympathy. The media battle this week to persuade the world that Britain is the retreating colonial power and Mauritius is claiming its rightful inheritance is the latest round in a long international campaign. The incongruity of Chagossian exiles returning on a large cruise ship, replete with Jacuzzis and a deck-top bar, may have diluted the Mauritian message of colonial expropriation (and it certainly provoked criticism from the Chagossian diaspora in Crawley, Sussex.) But a vessel that size, carrying tenders for surveying a large reef, was required. It had originally been intended to accommodate the Mauritian prime minister. Four hundred miles out from the Seychelles – cutting through the deep sea’s heavy swell in an area regularly swept by cyclones – the need for a robust, ocean-going ship was easy to appreciate.",News/World news,Chagossian exiles celebrate emotional return as UK tries to justify control,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/chagossian-exiles-celebrate-emotional-return-as-uk-tries-to-justify-control
2/20/2022,"The “creeping tendrils of the Kremlin” have been allowed to wrap themselves around the UK and turn London into a global money laundering capital, Keir Starmer has said, as he accused successive Conservative governments of failing to act on the threat. In an excoriating attack on the government’s stance on Russian influence within Britain, the Labour leader said that the UK needed to get “our own house in order” as it unites with the west to confront Vladimir Putin.  The warning comes as new figures obtained by the Observer show nearly 30,000 properties in England and Wales including mansions owned by the Russian elite are registered to companies and individuals based in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Most of the owners are unknown after delays in a government pledge to end secret offshore ownership of property. Writing in the Observer, Starmer says greater transparency, more powerful counter-espionage measures and new anti-corruption laws are required to combat money laundering in the UK. He said that Putin deployed illicit money and influence “as a judo move that turns the openness and freedom of western democracies into weaknesses”. “Over almost 12 years of Tory government, the creeping tendrils of the Kremlin have been allowed to wrap themselves around the UK,” he writes. “A cottage industry has been created that directly and indirectly does the bidding of those linked to Putin.” He said a new report by the anti-corruption organisation Transparency International had revealed how £1.5bn of UK property has been snapped up by Russians accused of corruption or linked to the Kremlin. “They are not buying here for the weather: they see us as a soft touch, where they can hide cash with few questions asked,” he writes. New figures in a separate analysis obtained by the Observer show the BVI is a main low-tax offshore jurisdiction for companies and individuals owning property in the UK. The analysis by the Centre for Public Data, a UK non-profit organisation, of the most recent property data reveals 21,496 property titles in England and Wales are registered to companies in the BVI and another 7,898 are registered to individuals. The BVI does not disclose company owners and many of the individuals who are property title holders are nominees acting for offshore trusts. Experts have established that a number of these properties, including some of the country’s most expensive homes, are linked to Russian billionaires. Anna Powell-Smith, the director of the Centre for Public Data, said: “These figures show the extraordinary role the British Virgin Islands plays in the UK property market. “It is over five years since the government promised to clean up the UK property market by publishing the true owners behind secretive offshore companies. The legislation is ready, but progress has stalled.” The BVI has committed to introducing a public register of company ownership by next year, but the exact details are yet to be confirmed after officials said some individuals should still be entitled to privacy. It was reported by the publication EUobserver this month that the BVI is expected to be added this week by the EU to a “grey list” of tax havens. Ministers are under mounting pressure amid claims that lax anti-corruption measures have allowed suspected illicit funds into Britain. The Observer reported last month that the government was being urged to suspend its tier 1 investor visa scheme, the “golden visa”, over concerns that the super-rich from Russia and other countries had been fast-tracked for UK residency without proper checks. The home secretary, Priti Patel, announced last week the scheme was being scrapped with immediate effect as part of a “renewed crackdown on illicit finance and fraud”. The tier 1 investor visa programme allowed people with at least £2m in investment funds and a UK bank account to apply for residency rights. The speed of their application for indefinite leave to remain was dictated by how much money they had to invest. In the year to September 2021, 798 investor visas were issued, 82 of them to Russians. David Davis, the former cabinet minister, said: “I think we have at least 700 Russian multimillionaires in the country. We have been too slack.” Of the golden visas, he added: “It seems to me that the natural next step is to review all the ones that have been given already with a view to ensuring that the source of the wealth that has allowed them to come here is acceptable to the United Kingdom.” Ministers say they will implement a package of measures to help combat financial crime. A government spokesperson said: “The government will establish a new beneficial ownership register of overseas entities that own UK property, in order to combat money laundering and achieve greater transparency in the UK property market.”",News/World news,Starmer: Russians hide cash in ‘soft touch’ UK,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/starmer-russians-hide-cash-in-soft-touch-uk
2/20/2022,"Louis Theroux’s Forbidden America: Extreme and Online (BBC Two) | iPlayerSeverance Apple TV+The Promise (BBC Four) | iPlayerGemma Collins: Self-Harm and Me Channel 4 | All 4 Should the openly bigoted be given the mainstream platform they crave? That was the ethical stink bomb permeating the opener of BBC Two’s three-part documentary series Louis Theroux’s Forbidden America, the first part of which dealt with the internet-based US far right (the other episodes will focus on rap and pornography). It raised the question: does this really need to be shown?  For sure, the people Theroux meets bask in the negative attention: at times, the parade of needy chancers make reality TV hopefuls look positively Amish. There’s Nick Fuentes, who runs an America First convention, who thinks that white people are bullied, and women shouldn’t vote. And livestreamer Baked Alaska, whose followers spit prejudice in disguised voices. Another streamer, Beardson Beardly, turns up wearing a Louis Theroux T-shirt, his eyes gleaming at his own meta-audacity. Challenged about an alleged Nazi salute, Beardson erupts, and later trashes Theroux on his show, yelling feebly: “You’re a piece of shit and I don’t like you!” Oh Beardson, don’t leave us this way. A big tell is the misogyny: one of the few women featured explains to Theroux how she was threatened with anal rape. Elsewhere, the documentary crystallises how savvy this relatively new breed consider themselves to be. In a bubbling online swamp of agitators, “incels”, gamers and “irony bros”, it’s a new level of evolved bigotry: the same racism, sexism and homophobia, but delivered with a snicker, a wink, a Get Out Of Hate-Speech Jail Free card. They film Theroux filming them. They talk about “majority white” but coyly deny white nationalism. Solemn avowals are made about “not supporting slavery”, as if it’s a valid option they’ve graciously declined. The result is a glimpse of the dark underbelly of Online Bigot USA, except of course it’s also happening everywhere else. Theroux drops the faux-naive act he started his career with, emerging as a stronger, more direct documentarian. Far from sanitising unsavoury mindsets, he holds them up to scrutiny, albeit, his rightwing subjects would claim, with a big pair of “pretentious liberal journalist!” tongs. Should such programmes be made? I’d say so: not looking at something doesn’t make it go away. The new nine-part Apple TV+ offering Severance, set in a near-dystopian future, co-created and co-written by Dan Erickson (The Good Fight; Blue Bloods) and co-directed by Ben Stiller, seems to ask: how much should work own us? Adam Scott plays Mark, a corporate suit at mysterious data outfit Lumen Industries, a white corridored warren that instils instant Black Mirror-style unease. Mark and his co-workers, including John Turturro and Zach Cherry, have willingly submitted to a controversial implant that divides memories of work and home, meaning they (when they’re “Innies” at the office) remember nothing of home, and (as “Outies”) remember nothing of work when they’re at home. The outside world seems bleak (Mark is widowed), while the Lumen bosses, including Patricia Arquette and Tramell Tillman, are menacingly clinical. As a new Innie, played by Britt Lower, rebels (“Am I livestock?”), a former co-worker warns Mark about Lumen. Watching the first two available episodes, I pondered: is Severance an existential cogitation on work-life balance, with a side note on separation of self? I also thought, jeez, guys, I’m not immortal, get on with it. Severance proceeds at the kind of pace at which you might need to stick a hot fork in your thigh to stay alert. In a remarkable cast (Christopher Walken shows up later), Turturro is underemployed, while Arquette gives a performance so dry it leaves dandruff. Nor is it funny, unless mechanically blank passes for black humour. Still, I appreciate the imaginative reach, the attempt at something different. Peeking ahead a few episodes, twists and shocks seem to be – finally – deigning to arrive. Over on BBC Four, the television gods give us another reason to commit to subtitles with French six-part thriller The Promise. Created by Gaëlle Bellan and former Spiral showrunner Anne Landois, directed by Laure de Butler, it’s an elegantly macabre tale about children going missing over two time zones and has been a big hit in France. Detective Pierre Castaing (Olivier Marchal) is obsessively convinced that the seedy Serge Fouquet (Guy Lecluyse) is the culprit in a missing-girl case. Twenty years later, Castaing’s daughter, Sarah (Sofia Essaïdi), now also a detective, returns to investigate another child’s disappearance. Could Fouquet be responsible, and why does Sarah’s onetime love (Robinson Stévenin) keep falling under suspicion? Set in the densely forested Landes region, The Promise takes full metaphorical advantage of the elements, starting with the wild storm ripping though trees and sky as the first small girl disappears. From there, the plot spins out like a sticky cobweb, keeping you speculating until (almost) the end. Heading a sterling cast, Essaïdi is sometimes still, other times as volatile as her character’s father. The Promise becomes not just about the crimes, but also about how deep into the thickets of loyalty you can wander before you realise you have to give up, turn back and follow the breadcrumbs back to reality. Gemma Collins (AKA “GC”) is a sparky reality diva, formerly of The Only Way Is Essex. In Channel 4 documentary Gemma Collins: Self-Harm and Me, made in conjunction with the mental health charity Mind, she reveals a different side of herself. She started cutting herself at 13, and continued self-harming for 20 years. Her parents discovered her covered in blood, as did her now-fiance. Now Collins wants to have children, and she’s afraid the impulse will return. Talking to those around her, and visiting the self-harm charity Harmless, Collins seems determined to shed light on this issue, which, according to NHS figures cited in the documentary, affects one in 15 people in their lifetime, and one in six 16- to 24-year-olds. The programme could have committed to a deeper, more analytical dive, but Collins is commendably reflective, saying that even after she stopped cutting, she self-harmed in other ways, such as weight and relationships. And social media? At one point she reads out brutal online reactions to her self-harming (“I heard she cut her arm and gravy came out”). “It don’t bother me,” she snaps, but just for a second, her eyes flash with something sadder than anger.
