2/8/2022,"A Venezuelan woman was shot and wounded and her nine-month-old baby was killed in her arms when Trinidad and Tobago’s coast guard opened fire on the boat carrying migrants fleeing their home country. In a statement posted on Facebook, the coast guard said its personnel had opened fire “in self-defence” on Saturday after “aggressive manoeuvres” by the migrant craft when it was intercepted as it entered Trinidadian waters late on Saturday.  “The ramming effort by the suspect vessel which was larger than the ship’s boat caused the crew to fear for their lives and in self-defence they fired at the engines of the suspect vessel in an attempt to bring it to a stop,” the statement said. When crewmen boarded the vessel, they found a group of migrants who had been hiding, including “one adult female who was holding an infant and who she indicated was bleeding … Regrettably, the infant was found unresponsive,” the statement said. The mother was taken to a hospital for treatment, according to the statement. “I expressed my deepest sympathy on my own behalf and of all the people of Trinidad and Tobago with respect to the unfortunate loss of life of the baby,” the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Keith Rowley, said in his own statement. Human rights activists have called for a thorough investigation of the incident. “Opening fire on fleeing migrants and asylum seekers that have identified themselves as such would be an atrocity,” said Geoff Ramsey, director for Venezuela at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), a thinktank. “This needs a thorough investigation into not only the circumstances around the child’s death but also a migration system that apparently allows the use of deadly force and routinely violates Venezuelans’ right to seek asylum.” Venezuela, despite boasting the world’s largest proven oil reserves, is mired in social, economic, and political crises, with hyperinflation rampant and shortages in food, energy, and medication a daily reality for the population of 28 million. President Nicolás Maduro has been accused of crimes against humanity by the international criminal court, as he continues to withstand a challenge to his legitimacy from opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who is recognised by the US, Britain, and dozens of others as Venezuela’s rightful leader. Maduro has not commented publicly on the infant’s tragic death, though Guaidó tweeted that the “unjustified” killing “hurts our soul as a country”. “No migrant child should ever die, whether traveling with their parents or alone. No mother wants to put the lives of her children at risk on a small ship in the deep sea, unless she has no other option,” said Jean Gough, UNICEF Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean. “Two in three Venezuelans on the move are women and children. This tragic event is a stark reminder that they are the most vulnerable among the vulnerable. They deserve special attention, protection and safety – anywhere and anytime.” Trinidad and Tobago, which sits about 60 miles (96 km) off the coast of Venezuela, has become a destination for roughly 25,000 migrants, usually arriving on rickety and overloaded fishing boats, part of a wider exodus that has seen nearly six million Venezuelans flee. Since 2018, over 100 Venezuelans have died while attempting to make the crossing. Many arrive to neighbouring Colombia and other Latin American countries on foot. Venezuelans are also arriving to the US border in record numbers, with US border authorities reporting 24,819 attempted crossings in December, up 206 from the previous year. Venezuelan migrants often face some backlash in their destination countries – despite generally welcoming messaging from governments – but Trinidad and Tobago has come under particular criticism for its draconian policies and practices.",News/World news,Infant killed after coast guard opens fire on boat carrying Venezuelan migrants ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/venezuela-immigrants-killed-trinidad-tobago-coast-guard
2/8/2022,"A trucker-led protest against vaccine mandates in Canada has raised several million dollars on a Christian crowdfunding site after being removed from GoFundMe, sparking debate over how online platforms moderate campaigns. GoFundMe blocked fundraising for the “Freedom Convoy” over the weekend, after the mayor of Ottowa declared a state of emergency over a week-long protest led by truck drivers over Covid-19 restrictions.  The protest began in response to requirements that cross-border truckers between US and Canada be fully vaccinated. By Saturday, Ottawa police had reported about 5,000 protesters and at least 300 counter protesters in the city’s streets with trucks blocking the street and shooting off fireworks. In response, GoFundMe stated that the “previously peaceful demonstration has become an occupation” and revoked more than $8m protesting truckers had raised on the crowdfunding platform. GoFundMe said on Saturday the group had violated its terms of service, and that the platform automatically refunded those who had donated to the cause. In response, the protestors migrated their fundraising to GiveSendGo, a self-proclaimed Christian crowdfunding site that in the past has hosted fundraisers for far-right groups including members of the Proud Boys and participants in the 6 January Capitol riots. GoFundMe’s decision to block fundraising for the group has drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle, with some condemning tech platforms for allowing potentially fringe groups to fundraise while Republicans claim anti-conservative bias. Republican attorney general Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia urged residents on Friday to report GoFundme if they had been “victimized by a deceptive act or practice” and Donald Trump Jr. tweeted that “All GOP Attorney Generals” should follow suit. Four other states over the weekend promised to investigate GoFundMe, including Florida, Louisiana, Ohio and Texas. Ohio attorney general Dave Yost told the Washington Post he is looking into GoFundMe’s policies on refunds and suspensions of campaigns. “What are you going to do next time when it’s not as visible a thing and you decide to pull out of a fundraiser for your own purposes?” Yost said, adding that the automatic refund “shouldn’t just be a result of public pressure, that should be the way they do business.” Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, also a Republican, said his office has “assembled a team to investigate” potential wrongdoing. On Twitter he called GoFundMe a “BLM-backing company” that “went woke,” referring to the Black Lives Matter movement.",Global,GoFundMe draws criticism after pulling funding of Ottawa protests,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/feb/07/gofundme-criticism-pulling-funding-ottawa-protests
2/8/2022,"Protesters against Covid vaccine mandates for truckers have defied government calls for them to end an 10-day occupation of Canada’s capital, a day after the city’s mayor declared a state of emergency and promised to “get the city back”. Ottawa police have described the protest as a “siege” on the city, where hundreds of trucks and cars have blockaded the downtown areas. On Sunday, Mayor Jim Watson warned that officials were “losing this battle”, and a civil class-action lawsuit was filed against protesters over the incessant horn blasting and disruption to daily life.  But on Monday morning a 10am deadline outlined in the class action suit – which asked protesters to leave of their own volition or face damages of nearly C$10m (US$7.9m) – came and went with no sign that an end to the protest was at hand. Dozens of big-rig trucks, RVs and pickups remained parked in front of Parliament Hill and nearby streets, and protesters showed no signs of leaving. Ron, a highway rescue worker from a small community in rural British Columbia, was taking shelter at a disused bus stop. (Services have been suspended because buses are unable to reach the city centre.) “I came here for my grandbabies,” he said, arguing that Canadians had been robbed of making medical choices. “I don’t want them live under the thumb of the government.” Canada has one of the world’s highest rates of vaccination against Covid-19, (some 85% of the country’s truckers are vaccinated) and public health measures have been broadly supported. But Ron teared up describing an elderly neighbour who died two days after being vaccinated. A doctor said she had died of a rapid onset of cancer, but Ron said that he didn’t believe him. The “freedom convoy” began in the final week of January as a demonstration against vaccine mandates but has morphed into protest against broader public health measures – and as a rallying point for conspiracy theorists and opponents of the government of Justin Trudeau. Swastikas, Confederate flags and QAnon symbols have all been seen at the protests. Hundreds of signs hung from the front gates of parliament, accusing the government of stripping away Canada’s freedoms and demanding that people “wake up”. With temperatures hovering below freezing, protesters warmed up around small fires. One homemade sign on a protester’s car appeared to equate the vaccine mandate with the Nazi persecution of the Jews. A red-haired man who did not give his name said he had travelled from Alberta – more than 3,000km away – to join the protest. He said that staying on might “financially break” him, but argued that a “slippery slope” of worse outcomes would await if vaccines mandates were allowed to remain in force. “They’re calling us xenophobes but how could xenophobes be uniting the world?” he said. The protests have drawn considerable support from US groups opposing Covid-19 restrictions and prominent Republican figures including Ted Cruz, Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump, who has called Trudeau, a “far-left lunatic” who had “destroyed Canada with insane Covid mandates”. Gerald Butts, a former senior adviser to Trudeau, tweeted: “For some senior American politicians, patriotism means renting a mob to put a G7 capital under siege.” Many small businesses in the downtown core of the city remained shuttered on Monday, with owners preferring to shut down than risk altercations with the protesters – who often refuse to wear masks inside. Anger was growing among local residents at the failure of the police and city officials to disperse the protest, amid reports that truckers and their supporters had harassed or threatened locals. Alexa Reedman, who was out walking her dog not far from the protest, had no patience with the protesters. “They should just leave. Now.” She described an atmosphere of constant stress over the past week. “You just don’t feel comfortable – you don’t feel 100% safe any more. It was initially called a protest, but when people use the word ‘occupation’ that really resonates – it does feel like an occupation. You just can’t live normally,” she said. After residents of a nearby apartment block argued with truckers on Sunday night over the constant barrage of airhorns, two protesters allegedly started a fire in the building’s lobby and taped the doors shut. Ottawa police said on Monday that its arson unit was investigating. But the convoy has also won supporters: thousands of people came to the protest site on Saturday. The convoy has also gained millions of dollars in crowdfunding support, currently being gathered by a Christian crowdfunding site called GiveSendGo, after the original GoFundMe which amassed more than $10m was cancelled. Last week, Ottawa police said the crowdfunding had attracted “significant” support from the US. In the few days since the new crowdfunding page was launched, supporters have sent in nearly $5m. On Monday, GiveSendGo tweeted “money for what you’re passionate about. We won’t stop you like others will!” Directly in front of parliament, the driver of a semi-tractor parked in the road was sounding his horn and revving his engine, sending out plumes of black exhaust. Emblazoned on the side of the vehicle was the slogan: “God-given IMMUNITY works best.” An elderly man in a face mask walked past, holding a sign saying: “Truckers go home.”",News/World news,Ottawa protesters defy growing calls to end occupation of capital,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/ottawa-protesters-defy-deadline-end-occupation-capital
2/8/2022,"The Morrison government will seek to protect gay students from expulsion without protecting trans students at the same time, a senior minister has revealed. On Monday Morrison recommitted to bringing an amendment to prevent children being expelled “because of their sexuality”, but the latest government amendments fall short of protecting students on gender identity.  The finance minister and Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, confirmed on Tuesday that “the proposal is to repeal the exemption as it relates to sexual orientation, [but] it doesn’t go further than that”. Birmingham told Radio National the Australian Law Reform Commission would continue to examine the issue of discrimination on the basis of gender identity, meaning a delay of at least a further 12 months after the religious discrimination bill passes. Birmingham said the Sex Discrimination Act amendment for same-sex attracted students would be “a positive step forward” and protections for trans students would “still be subject to a relatively quick” review. Birmingham said he wanted to see “as much discrimination removed as possible while respecting” the ability of schools of faith to set their own ethos. The incomplete protections appear to breach both a commitment Morrison made to Anthony Albanese in writing on 1 December to prevent “any form of discrimination against a student on the basis of sexuality or gender identity” and to a group of four Liberal MPs who negotiated for the religious exemption to the Sex Discrimination Act to be removed. The move seeks to head off conservative Christian ire at the deal to protect students and prevent what assistant attorney general, Amanda Stoker, has described as “unintended consequences” of schools being unable to maintain standards of behaviour by discriminating against gender non-conforming students. The religious discrimination bill is set to return to parliament on Tuesday and the prime minister is pushing for a vote that will probably require Labor support to pass, given divisions in the Liberal party over the bill. On Friday Labor MPs and senators on two committees joined the government in calling for the bill to pass after a series of minor and technical changes, but is yet to finalise its position, citing the need to scrutinise amendments. In December, Morrison wrote to Labor promising the government would “move an amendment to remove the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act which were included in 2013 which limited the protections provided under this Act,” a reference to the ability of schools to discriminate on the grounds of sexuality and gender. The Coalition faces fierce internal resistance to the bill, with the member for Bass, Bridget Archer, telling Guardian Australia on Friday she can’t support it in its current form, and senator Andrew Bragg seeking protections for teachers and removal of the controversial statements of belief clause. Although Liberal MP Angie Bell has said removal of the religious exemption to the SDA would be enough to win her vote, it is unclear whether excluding trans students will imperil a deal with her and three other MPs, Fiona Martin, Katie Allen and Dave Sharma. Sharma has also expressed concerns about teachers, while Allen has investigated amending the statement of belief clause so it doesn’t override state laws. Trent Zimmerman and Warren Entsch have both reserved their position. Entsch told Guardian Australia he “never believed the bill should have been there in the first place”. On Monday Morrison told reporters the Sex Discrimination Act changes “go well together” with the religious discrimination bill “which I intend to become an Act in the near future”, signalling a vote as early as Tuesday in the lower house. “It’s a very important bill,” he said. “It’s a bill that means that a Sikh family can go and rent an apartment and not be discriminated against.” Morrison said the bill would also ensure “people can speak their beliefs” in society or in the workplace. “My hope … is that it is a bill that will bring Australians together around this issue.” On Monday Albanese said his position was that people “shouldn’t be discriminated against on the basis of their faith, or their gender, or their sexuality, or their race”. “But legislation has to be workable,” he told The Conversation. “And the test is – can you ensure that you’re supporting non-discrimination without discriminating against another group? That’s the test here that we’ve said all along we would apply. “But I do not believe that anyone should be discriminated against on the basis of their faith.”",News/Australia news,"Religious discrimination bill will not protect trans students from expulsion, Simon Birmingham confirms",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/religious-discrimination-bill-will-not-protect-trans-students-from-expulsion-simon-birmingham-confirms

2/8/2022,"This Cup of Nations was played under a shadow from the moment eight supporters died outside Olembe Stadium a fortnight ago. There is no excusing what happened at a venue surrounded by vast spaces and the depressing sense remains that its causes will be swept under the carpet. After driving back to Yaoundé the following day and speaking with Romaric, who had been in the ground and encountered people who had been caught up in the crush as he left, the horror of what had occurred started to become clear. A subsequent visit to the emergency hospital brought some harrowing testimonies; these are, sadly, the words and images that linger. NA  The Olembe tragedy, understandably and inevitably, will dominate reflections on the tournament. I was in Bafoussam when it occurred but returned to Yaoundé the following day. Talking to two survivors and the doctor who had treated them, the remarkable Diana Bikele, in a hospital ward the following day was humbling and horrifying. Our initial report was written with a sense of sorrow; later, as we understood the scale of the incompetence that had led to the disaster, came anger. JW Ivory Coast 2-2 Sierra Leone Sierra Leone had not competed at a Cup of Nations since 1996 and what was, on the face of things, a rag-tag squad seemingly with little chance of making waves in Cameroon. But a smart, spirited side held Algeria and then shocked an Ivory Coast side packed with top-level experience. They equalised once through an explosive finish from Musa Kamara, who plays in the local top flight, and squared things again with the last kick after a disastrous error from Badra Sangara, the Ivorian keeper. Alhaji Kamara capitalised and the Leone Stars had earned their luck. NA Ghana 2-3 Comoros The format doesn’t deserve good games in the group stage but, mystifyingly, it produced two classics at the end: Ivory Coast’s win against Algeria and Comoros’s victory against a Ghana side who, at last – down to 10 men, 2-0 down and facing elimination – found some fight. After they had levelled the scores, though, a well-organised Comoros side who attacked well on the break found an 84th-minute winner through Ahmed Mogni to secure the Coelacanths’ passage to the last 16 at their first Cup of Nations. JW Sadio Mané Just imagine the weight Sadio Mané was bearing as he walked up to take the tournament’s decisive penalty: he had missed from the spot earlier on, had previous for fluffing his lines in shoot-outs for Senegal, and was now relied upon to bring them their first-ever Afcon. His conversion was emphatic, the celebrations and post-match comments emotional, and it was easy to feel joy for one of the most likeable players among the world’s leading lights. Like Senegal, Mané had grown into the competition after a slow start; his quality was key in helping them to surge clear in knockout games. NA Sadio Mané Vincent Aboubakar’s achievement in scoring eight of the 100 goals in the tournament (8% in a 24-team tournament is some kind of footballing equivalent of Charles Bannerman, who scored 67.35% of Australia’s runs in the first ever Test innings), but by the time he stepped up to take the decisive penalty, this had clearly been Mané’s tournament. He scored three goals, made two more and, in a Senegal team often largely functional, offered a measure of flair. And, having missed a penalty in normal time, when it came to it he had the nerve to smash home the decisive kick in the shoot-out. JW Youssouf M’Changama v Cameroon Had tragic events outside the stadium not overshadowed everything that night, a keeper-less Comoros’ display against Cameroon would have made for a heartwarming evening of tournament football. The islanders’ goal will not be lost to history, though: Youssouf M’Changama had no right to find the top corner when lining up a free-kick from so far out that the hosts had not even constructed a wall, but his execution was breathtaking. Whip, power and placement gave Andre Onana no chance even though his view was unimpeded. NA Gabadinho Mhango v Morocco Malawi had never reached the last 16 and were massive underdogs against a very good Morocco. Seven minutes in, though, Gabadinho Mhango drifted in from the right and, seeing the keeper Yassine Bounou off his line, whipped a shot over him. Bounou got a fingertip to it, which perhaps fractionally detracted from the aesthetic, but in terms of vision and execution, this was brilliant. JW A visit to the Minawao refugee camp, in Cameroon’s troubled far north, brought reflection on how football can help to empower and foster hope of a better future. The girls’ team in Minawao all fled across the border with Nigeria to seek safety from Boko Haram when they were extremely young. They have experienced horrors but the striking thing, in one of the earth’s bleaker corners, was their collective spirit and optimism. Human beings’ resilience never ceases to amaze, even though it should never have to be called upon like this. The team’s appetite to train, play and learn five days a week was infectious: it is a shame, though, that they still lack the kit – especially footwear – to do so comfortably. NA Burkina Faso’s players watched the coup unfolding in their homeland on the television in their hotel before the quarter-final against Tunisia. Their coach Kamou Malo spoke of being “very emotional” and his intention to “dedicate this win to our people who are being tested by current events”. That the win really had made a difference was obvious by the scenes from Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso as the curfews that had been imposed by the military were broken by thousands pouring out on the streets in spontaneous celebration. A reminder, beyond all the nonsense, of the power football still retains. That, and meeting colleagues and friends from across the world you only see every two years which, after all the Covid restrictions, perhaps meant more this time (helped by Yaoundé’s many excellent restaurants). JW Fun though it was, the quality of this tournament felt like a drop-off from the previous two editions. There are some force majeure explanations for that, including Covid-19 disruptions that scuppered several sides’ best plans early and a lack of preparation time for key players. Many games moved along sluggishly although it would have helped if the pitches facilitated slick, fast-paced football. The surface in Douala was borderline dangerous, contributing to that Sierra Leone leveller against Ivory Coast, and was presumably the reason a quarter-final and a semi-final were moved from an expensive, almost brand-new venue. Things were not that much better in Yaounde, the Olembe pitch cutting up noticeably in the final week; Cameroon has had the time and money to sort this out and the fact it did not was a huge disservice to the continent’s best players. NA Where do you start? The Cup of Nations has developed a reputation for two things – disorganisation and negative football – and both were features of Cameroon 2021. Press facilities, understandably, concern nobody but journalists, but they are significant for two reasons: they are emblematic of wider issues and, if the idea is for the tournament to project the African game to the world, they have to be better than this. In Douala and the Admadou Ahidjo in Yaoundé, this was as bad as anything since Angola 2010: no desks, no power, baffling and counterproductive bureaucracy. The negativity on the pitch is not so much about defensiveness as about spoiling – feigning injury, wasting time, breaking the rhythm, pressuring referees: Egypt were the kings, but they were not alone. JW Mohamed Abou Gabal (Egypt); Achraf Hakimi (Morocco), Omar Colley (Gambia), Mohamed Abdelmonem (Egypt), Nouhou Tolo (Cameroon); Ibrahim Sangaré (Ivory Coast), Idrissa Gueye (Senegal), Blati Toure (Burkina Faso); Sadio Mané (Senegal), Vincent Aboubakar (Cameroon), Iban Edú (Equatorial Guinea). NA Gabal; Hakimi, Edmond Tapsoba (Burkina Faso), Colley, Saliou Ciss (Senegal); Sangaré, Gueye, Mohamed Elneny (Egypt); Sofiane Boufal (Morocco), Aboubakar, Mané. JW The climactic closing stages of the final did little to excite two journalists in the row in front of me, who appeared to be on a date. They had spent the evening watching music videos on YouTube through shared headphones – perhaps forgivable given the on-pitch fare – and, as the players prepared for penalties, could be seen transfixed by Enrique Iglesias’s “Hero”. Credit where it is due: the crooner was put on pause when the spot-kicks began and, judging by their reaction when Senegal won, such a long and attritional night had caused no lasting damage to their relationship. NA Three times on the 5hr 30min journey from Yaoundé to Douala for the last-16 game between Egypt and Ivory Coast, we were flagged down by orange-clad road-safety patrols. Twice they found spurious reasons to fine us. For the journey back, though, our driver, Big Syl, had a secret weapon: a sailor’s hat that it looked like he’d picked up in a cheap fancy-dress shop. But it worked: every time we approached a patrol, Syl donned the hat and sped up; each time we were waved through.

2/8/2022,"Six million people are waiting for non-urgent surgery and hospital treatment in England. NHS England has been formulating an “elective recovery plan” – delayed by the onset of Omicron – to get waiting times closer to the 18-week maximum enshrined in the NHS constitution.  It is the government and NHS’s joint plan to tackle the unprecedented 6 million-strong backlog of people awaiting non-urgent hospital treatment, mainly surgery, in England. It was originally due to be published in early December. However, its launch was delayed by the emergence that month of the Omicron variant of Covid and behind-the-scenes wrangling between ministers and NHS England over how demanding the targets imposed on hospitals – to clear the backlog and in particular to eradicate waits of up to two years for care – should be. NHS England has been in charge and will launch the plan this week, possibly on Tuesday. Sir James Mackey, the chief executive of Northumbria NHS trust, has played a leading role in formulating the plan and suggesting changes to help hospitals provide quicker care. He is widely admired in the NHS and Whitehall as an original thinker and someone whose trust has managed to keep more elective care going, despite the turmoil of Covid, than many others. A number of initiatives intended to get back to most patients waiting no longer than the supposed 18-week maximum enshrined in the NHS constitution. For example, hospitals will stop inviting many patients for at least some of the checks and follow-up appointments that have been standard for years, in an attempt to free up doctors and nurses so they can spend more time in operating theatres and less time in clinics. Mackey believes many such appointments are “pointless” and tie up consultants unnecessarily. He wants to see change “on an industrial scale”. Yes, the plan will break new ground for the NHS by giving patients the right to have their operation at a hospital many miles from their home, if it has spare capacity. The NHS will also be expected to help patients overcome the challenges involved, such as transport. But hospital bosses stress privately that the sheer size of the backlog, lack of staff and practical difficulties involved for patients mean that few are likely to select to have their operation this way. There will be an expansion of the separation between “hot” and “cold” sites that some NHS trusts have used during the pandemic to maintain as much planned care as possible. While “hot” sites have treated Covid patients, huge efforts have gone into keeping “cold” sites – usually smaller hospitals that do not have an A&E – free of the disease so that cancer surgery, heart operations, hip and knee replacements and other types of surgery can still go ahead. Trusts such as Wolverhampton, Northumbria and University College London hospital have all done that, enabling important surgery to go ahead.",News/Society,The NHS elective recovery plan: how it aims to clear the surgery backlog,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/07/the-nhs-elective-recovery-plan-how-it-aims-to-clear-the-surgery-backlog
2/8/2022,"Bruno Guimarães barely had time to settle into his seat at St James’ Park and survey the sea of unfamiliar faces in front of him before the conversation turned to global domination. “We’re going to be a big power in world football,” said Newcastle’s new £33.3m Brazil midfielder. “The owners were very up front that, this season, the idea is to stay in the Premier League but the main objective in the years to come is to be in the Champions League and, eventually, to win the Champions League.”  Some of those present may have looked a little doubtful but his optimism seemed infectious and it was not long before the 24-year-old was asked whether he regarded Newcastle as potentially a bigger club than Arsenal. “Definitely,” said the former Lyon player, who was heavily courted by Arsenal. “It’s already a club with a great tradition, a big history. I have no doubts about my decision to come here. I believe in everything the owners told me about their project.” If the diamonds adorning his watch caught the eye, his answers, transmitted through an interpreter, betrayed no sign of brashness. Granted, the player Eddie Howe hopes to build his side around appeared confident but there was also a certain modesty and a refreshing politeness. After beginning by apologising, unnecessarily and in fairly decent English, for his lack of fluency in the language, Guimarães explained his attachment to the No 39 shirt he hopes to wear for the first time when Everton visit Tyneside for Tuesdays relegation six-pointer. “My dad was a taxi driver for 20 years and No 39 was his taxi number,” he said. “So when I signed for my first professional club, Athletico Paranaense, he asked me to take his number for my shirt. It sustained my family when I was growing up and we won four league titles at Paranaense so it has also proved lucky for me on the pitch. I take it everywhere with me.” An only child, Guimarães is close to his parents and, along with his girlfriend, they were on the private jet that brought him to Newcastle last week. “My family are everything,” he said. “I carry them with me everywhere. I have my mum and dad’s names tattooed on me.” Newcastle need to build on their dismal record of two Premier League wins this season but the new boy appears undaunted by this challenge. Indeed, consultation with compatriots playing in England indicates Newcastle have been underachieving. “Thiago Silva, Gabriel Jesus and Alex Telles have told me how difficult it is to play at Newcastle, given how passionate the fans are,” he said. “Their words meant I didn’t really have to think twice about coming here.” Newcastle have spent more than £90m on five January signings and Guimarães will be seen as the principal catalyst, speeding the transition from a cagey counterattacking team to a more front-foot, possession-based side. Happily a manager further bolstered by Dan Ashworth’s impending relocation from Brighton as technical director seems on a similar philosophical wavelength to his marquee signing. “I’ve always been inspired by two Spanish players, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi,” Guimarães said, before explaining that playing futsal while growing up in Rio de Janeiro accelerated a purist streak shared with Howe. “I owe a lot to futsal. It’s the small space, you have to think quicker than others. With futsal your close control is so important and that’s something you’re going to see a lot in my games. I’m really happy with the legacy futsal gave me.” Similarly life at Lyon provided some vital toughening up for a man proud to follow in the footsteps of Mirandinha, the first Brazilian to play professionally in England when he joined Newcastle in 1987. “There’s similarities between the Premier League and Ligue 1,” Guimarães said. “Ligue 1’s very physical, there’s a lot of contact so French football really prepared me for the physical battle ahead.” Newcastle’s pursuit of Guimarães was aided by the presence of Cláudio Caçapa on Lyon’s coaching staff. From 2007 to 2009 the Brazilian made 29 largely nondescript, defensive midfield performances at St James’ Park. “I spoke a lot to him about coming here and he helped me in my decision.”",Sport/Football,‘A big power in world football’ – Bruno Guimarães sets out Newcastle aims | Louise Taylor,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/big-power-world-football-bruno-guimaraes-newcastle
2/8/2022,"Boris Johnson has been accused of a “shameful spinning” of key pledges on cancer care in an attempt to distract from the NHS’s record 6 million-strong backlog of people on waiting lists. The prime minister used a visit to a cancer centre in Kent to unveil plans for what were portrayed as two new care standards that would ensure people in England with the disease get diagnosed more quickly.  But opposition parties condemned the move as a “pathetic rehashing of old pledges” and a cynical attempt to try to persuade the media to reduce their focus on a row between the government and NHS chiefs over how quickly hospitals can be expected to treat the hundreds of thousands of patients who have been waiting between one and two years for surgery. The spat overshadowed and forced the postponement of Monday’s launch of the long-awaited “elective recovery plan”, which was due to set out the government’s plans to tackle the backlog. NHS England is now expected to finally publish the plan – which was originally due in early December – on Tuesday. However, it quickly emerged that Johnson’s pledge that 75% of people who develop cancer will be diagnosed early by 2028 matched an objective first announced by NHS England in its long-term plan in January 2019, when Theresa May was still in Downing Street. The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, pointed out that a second promise – that 75% of suspected cancer patients will be told if they have the disease or not within 28 days of being urgently referred by a GP – was an NHS standard that was already in place. “This is an existing target that was introduced in April and has never been met,” Streeting said. NHS England figures covering April to November 2021 show the 75% target was not met during those eight months, and that in November just 71.3% of people displaying potential symptoms of cancer were told within 28 days that they had or did not have it. Johnson also said that by March next year the NHS would have reduced the backlog of cancer patients who have been waiting more than two months for cancer treatment to pre-pandemic levels. But in a Commons debate on the elective recovery plan, Streeting told MPs that the NHS had pledged to give cancer patients their “first definitive treatment” within 62 days back in late 2009, when Labour was in power. The target had not been hit since 2015, he said, adding: “Isn’t this another example of the Conservatives lowering standards for patients because they consistently fail to meet them?” Streeting said: “The prime minister announced what he called two ‘tough new cancer targets.’ One is a reannouncement and the other is actually weaker than the existing target. The Conservatives are lowering standards for patients because they failed to meet them.” Macmillan Cancer Support also noted that the claimed new target was nothing of the sort. “It’s welcome to see a focus on clearing the backlog of people waiting more than two months to start cancer treatment, but this is a target that’s been promised previously and repeatedly missed,” said Eve Byrne, the charity’s director of advocacy. Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ health spokesperson, accused Johnson of playing politics with cancer. About 360,000 Britons a year are diagnosed with cancer, and it kills 155,000. “This pathetic rehashing of old pledges for the unprecedented challenge we face is an insult to the millions of frightened cancer patients and their families,” Cooper said. “Johnson needs to understand that there are lives on the line right now – and that’s bigger than saving his job. Spinning something as vital as how quickly someone is diagnosed with cancer is shameful. Cancer is a terrible disease, not a PR opportunity for a desperate and embattled prime minister.” Michelle Mitchell, Cancer Research UK’s chief executive, said that for years cancer patients had not been getting care they are supposedly entitled to within set timeframes. “We’re happy to hear the prime minister is doubling down on cancer targets. But our current targets have been missed for years, and getting back to pre-pandemic levels simply isn’t good enough,” she said. Mitchell urged Sajid Javid, the health secretary, to make addressing what she called major shortages in the cancer workforce that were hampering the NHS’s ability to diagnose and treat people quickly the top priority of his newly declared “war on cancer”. The elective recovery plan will commit hospitals to make treatment of the 307,000 patients who have been waiting for a year and 18,600 who have been forced to wait two years a priority. They will also be expected to give 10% more patients elective care – mainly surgery such as joint replacements and cataract removals – in 2022-23 than they did before Covid struck in March 2020. Doctors’ leaders have said the backlog-busting plan will falter unless it is accompanied by a strategy to end the endemic understaffing across the NHS. “Simply put, any promises or unrealistic targets for returning to pre-pandemic levels of activity will fall flat without the staff to do the work”, said Dr Vishal Sharma, the chair of the British Medical Association’s consultants committee. Dr Dolin Bhagawati, the vice-chair of the Doctors’ Association UK, said: “The NHS is broken through years of underspend even before Covid hit. Any plan that does not provide realistically for staff recruitment and retention is simply worthless and not worth the paper it’s printed on. Talking about putting an MRI scanner in a novel place, for example, may grab headlines but frankly is a chocolate fireguard in front of an inferno.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson accused of ‘shameful spinning’ of cancer care targets,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/boris-johnson-accused-of-shameful-spinning-of-cancer-care-targets
2/8/2022,"Good morning. Federal parliament resumes today, with the controversial religious discrimination bill on the agenda. We’ll be keeping a close eye on the bushfires threatening homes in Western Australia and following the latest news on the Neighbours saga. Taxpayers have been paying more than $10,000 a month for George Christensen’s “e-material” in the same period that he racked up an $85,000 Facebook advertising bill for issues including “vaccine discrimination” and a conspiracy theory about the “unelected global elite”. Government records show Christensen claimed $12,641 for e-material in the second quarter of last year, jumping to $33,500 in the third quarter as the controversial Queensland MP began ramping up his campaign against vaccine mandates.  Voters are less angry about the Morrison government’s handling of the pandemic than they were a fortnight ago, but a majority of respondents disagree with the current definition of “fully vaccinated”, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. Morrison confirmed Australia’s international border would be reopened from 21 February for double vaccinated tourists and travellers – but 57% of poll respondents think the definition of fully vaccinated needs to be three jabs, not two. The border announcement provoked mixed emotions for those in Australia who have been separated from family or missed funerals in recent months but has been welcomed by the tourism industry. The UK will send 350 troops to Poland amid concerns the Ukraine crisis could spill over into eastern Europe. The bilateral move – meaning it takes place outside Nato’s structures – comes a few days after the US announced it would send in 1,700 paratroop reinforcements into Poland. French president Emmanuel Macron has warned against expecting “miracles” ahead of his talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow, as other world leaders met in a flurry of diplomatic activity. Joe Biden hosted Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, in Washington DC and a European delegation was in Kyiv. A recent trip by the Guardian to Russia found a hive of barely hidden military activity, with the latest reports stating troops and weapons are leaving their bases for forward staging posts in Kursk and Voronezh. Electric cars could recharge Australia’s automotive industry, a new report suggests. With sections of Australia’s old car factories still intact and components being made locally, Australia has a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to carve out a spot in the global automotive supply chain, according to the Rebuilding Vehicle Manufacturing in Australia report. A new consumer guide cuts through the “greenwash” of energy providers, ranking 48 Australian energy retailers based on climate criteria including: providing renewable energy, ending coal use by 2030 and halting fossil fuel expansion. A soundproofed torture chamber believed to have been used by a narcotics gang should remind cocaine users of the consequences of their habits, a Dutch public prosecutor has said. Protesters against Covid vaccine mandates for truckers have defied government calls for them to end an 11-day occupation of Canada’s capital, a day after Ottawa’s mayor declared a state of emergency and promised to “get the city back”. Boris Johnson’s new communications director has said Johnson is “not a complete clown”, as he revealed that the UK prime minister initiated a defiant rendition of Gloria Gaynor’s I Will Survive when the pair met last week. Israel will launch an inquiry into the alleged police use of Pegasus spyware against a wide range of public figures including politicians, businessmen, officials and activists. “We did our dance set to seated guests whose attention was mostly fixed on Princess Diana – as was ours. She was the most attentive person in the room, sitting forward across the banister, clapping and beaming her support. She kind of glowed,” says Kate Ceberano, recounting her most memorable gig as singer in funk band I’m Talking. But it wasn’t just Diana that had Ceberano’s attention at the Rocking With the Royals gig in 1985. “Michael Hutchence was luminous like a sun god – I always sat in the wings when we opened for INXS, transfixed by his presence and the romance of their sound,” she recalls. A former political staffer who was sexually assaulted by an Australian parliamentarian’s chief of staff in the early 2000s says it’s time to speak up and demand action from political leaders. “[Allegations of sexual assault, sexual harassment and bullying], both recent and historical, need to be investigated and, where substantiated, acted upon. In some cases, that may mean that the perpetrators lose their jobs. In others, it may also mean that they need to be dealt with by the courts. What cannot be allowed to happen is what has happened up until now – for these people to be protected and, in many cases, promoted, while only their victims have to face the devastating consequences of their behaviour.” The La Niña weather has brought humid conditions to many parts of the country, and with it, mildew. Thankfully there are plenty of ways to prevent mildew, including mould-resistant fabrics and proper storage. There are also plenty of options to bring a garment back from the brink after the rot has set in, according to Alice Payne, an associate professor of fashion at Queensland University of Technology. “A hot wash with some bleach” or spot treatment with lemon juice or hydrogen peroxide and drying the garment in the sun are among some of Payne’s suggestions. With a federal election just months away, all eyes are turning to the leader of the opposition party, Anthony Albanese, with the question: will he be our next prime minister? In today’s Full Story, Laura Murphy-Oates speaks to political editor Katharine Murphy about Albanese’s rise through Labor’s political ranks and the party’s strategy to win the election.

If that team plays the same way but results suddenly dry up, that’s bad. The underlying condition is largely the same, but that was obscured by the contrasting outcomes being delivered. A major review is needed, but only now that World Cup qualification looks unlikely.” The Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai has given her first interview to an independent media organisation since she alleged on Weibo that a senior Chinese official had coerced her into sex, saying it was an “enormous misunderstanding”, and announcing that she was retiring from tennis. The Sydney Morning Herald says there is growing pressure for Scott Morrison to act on his election promise to deliver a federal anti-corruption watchdog, despite just 10 days for parliament to meet before a potential May election. With a date set for international borders to reopen, there are calls by Sydney business leaders for the government to lift the ban on international cruises to revive the billion-dollar industry, reports the Daily Telegraph.

2/8/2022,"Monkeys that survived a devastating hurricane in Puerto Rico were prematurely aged by the experience, a study has found. Scientists say the findings suggest that an increase in extreme weather around the world may have negative biological consequences for the humans and animals affected.  The scientists said the rhesus macaques that lived through Hurricane Maria in 2017 appeared to have aged by about two years more than expected, equivalent to seven or eight years of human life. “Studying the impact of exposure to adversity is depressing stuff. You’re showing … these have negative impacts at multiple levels, and here at the molecular level … that’s long term,” said Noah Snyder-Mackler, a professor at the Center for Evolution and Medicine of Arizona State University, and one of the authors of the paper, published in the journal PNAS. Snyder-Mackler and colleagues had been collecting blood samples from the free-ranging rhesus macaques in the conservation centre at Cayo Santiago island, near Puerto Rico, since 2014. Rhesus macaques are the most studied monkey in science because they are biologically quite similar to humans. After Hurricane Maria hit, the blood samples collected as much as a year later showed significant changes to the monkeys’ immune systems. By using genomic sequencing technology, the researchers found that up to 4% of the monkeys’ genes were showing changes. There was a decrease in the genes associated with properly folding proteins so they can carry out their functions seamlessly, something seen naturally as monkeys and humans age. There was also an increase in the genes associated with inflammatory responses. This is also commonly seen as primates age, with chronic inflammation sometimes leading to cardiovascular disease and some cancers. “I think that it resonates when we say, oh, something molecular is actually changing in our cells,” said Marina Watowich, a graduate student in the SMack Lab at the University of Washington, and the lead author of the paper. “And that’s going to have long-term effects.” Watowich said it was important to note that the study looked at the average changes in the macaque population, meaning not all the monkeys were sampled every year, and some fared much better than others. “This is not like an all or nothing, like every single animal was negatively impacted after the storm,” Watowich said. “There was actually quite a lot of variation. And so that’s what we’re getting into next is who’s doing well after these events and who’s not doing well, and how can we make everyone like those ones who weren’t really affected?”",News/Science,Signs of premature ageing found in monkeys after hurricane,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/07/signs-of-premature-ageing-found-in-monkeys-after-hurricane
2/8/2022,"You can’t accuse Jackie Weaver of not seizing the opportunity when a meeting of Handforth parish council, Cheshire, that she chaired via Zoom a year ago this week, became a viral sensation. She has since written a book, launched a podcast, and starred in The Archers. Live comedy was only a matter of time – and so it comes to pass with Comedians’ Council, which casts Weaver as chair and three standups as disputatious councillors fielding parochial questions from the crowd. I encountered the event as part of the streaming platform NextUp’s coverage of the Leicester comedy festival, which runs in the east Midlands and online this month.  You won’t find the biggest names on NextUp’s livestreams – but this collection of up-and-comers and bubbling-unders offers a choice cross-section of UK comedy, particularly for those of us feeling festival-starved by Covid. The opening event First Night Funnies mainlined variety, with a character act, a Gen Z newcomer and a sketch double-act alongside dependable Live at the Apollo vet Nathan Caton. As Caton pointed out, this mixed-bill event at a “pizza shop in Leicester” was a far cry from the BBC’s bright lights. But it set the ball rolling, with likable material from Anna Magliano about a teenage trip to a sexual health clinic, sub-Flight of the Conchords spoof R&B from Good Kids (AKA Kieran Ahern and Tom Dowling) – and Caton on being locked-down with his recently acquired girlfriend. On Saturday night, Jessica Fostekew also talked Covid cohabitation, in her case with a six-year-old son. With strong, no-nonsense material about parenting in London, and discovering her queerness in her 30s, Fostekew’s set was the standout on a bill that also featured giggling bundle of musical nonsense Katie Pritchard, and Richard Stott riffing on his Poland syndrome, which led him to have surgery so that he had two fingers replaced with toes on one hand. Like Stott’s, Jamie MacDonald’s set Reasonably Adjusted zeroes in on his disability, taking its cue from a poll in which blindness was voted “the worst thing that could ever happen to you”. In front of a small and tentative crowd, but with jokes that deserved a bigger, louder one, the Glaswegian doesn’t suggest life without vision is any bowl of cherries – see his gag about feeling “like a municipal pinball” on bin day, when everyone leaves their wheelie bins on the pavement. But, ranging from his school years, via the Disability Discrimination Act of 1995, which changed his life, to a droll gag about “disabled appropriation” in the present day, he offers an upbeat if unsentimental take on visual impairment. If I’d known in advance the format for Weaver’s show, I’d have submitted my own question for the council’s consideration. “Is it a comedy festival when you watch it all from your own front room?” Instead, the two-and-a-half participating comics (Suzi Ruffell arrives late) ad-lib to the likes of “should you wear Crocs over the age of eight?” and “how big a dog is too big?” The council-meeting conceit is stretched very thin, but Weaver makes up in spirit, and occasional humour, what she lacks in slick presentational skills. (Awkward pauses abound.) By the end, the arbitrariness of the questions has defeated Sunil Patel, and it’s only Paul Sinha’s quick wit and Ruffell’s eagerness to make amends that keep the show afloat. If this is a TV show in utero – and with Weaver’s recent record, you wouldn’t bet against it – it may need a little more development. Leicester comedy festival runs until 20 February.",Arts/Stage,Leicester comedy festival review – Jackie Weaver whips the Comedians’ Council into line,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/07/leicester-comedy-festival-review-jackie-weaver-whips-the-comedians-council-into-line
2/8/2022,"If the thought of fractions or differential equations makes you break you out in a cold sweat, you are not alone. Maths anxiety – a negative emotional reaction to mathematics – is a global phenomenon, hampering maths achievement regardless of where people live, research has found. It’s not only a child’s own maths anxiety that affects their performance but that of their peers: the largest and most culturally diverse study to date shows that in about half of countries, including England, the average level of maths anxiety within the same school or classroom predicts individual students’ maths achievement, independently of their own anxiety levels.  “Having found that the emotional state of one’s peer group may have an effect on children’s maths achievement, it is important for teachers, parents and policymakers to not only be mindful of a child’s own ability or emotional state, but the context in which they’re studying,” said Dr Nathan Lau, of the University of Western Ontario, who led the research. Many people experience some degree of discomfort when confronted with a mathematical problem, ranging from mild tension to intense dread. Some people also experience physical symptoms such as a racing heart, sweating or feeling sick. Besides avoiding everyday situations involving numbers, people with such feelings may hold back from applying for promotions or pursuing careers in related subjects such as science, technology or engineering. To better understand the contextual factors underpinning maths anxiety, Lau and colleagues analysed data from 1,175,515 students who participated in three large international studies of achievement. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that students in countries with higher levels of maths anxiety tend to achieve lower maths grades. The strongest predictor of maths anxiety was how competent students perceived their maths teacher to be: those with less confidence in their teacher tended to feel more anxious. Being set large amounts of maths homework, and parental involvement in homework, also contributed to anxiety to a lesser degree. In about half of countries, it wasn’t only the child’s own level of maths anxiety that predicted their achievement but that of their peers. One factor appeared to be the cultural acceptance of uncertain situations. “It seems like the more rigid or less accepting of uncertainty [a culture is], the lower this peer group effect is,” Lau said. “We can’t really say if there’s a causal relationship, but one hypothesis is that teachers have a more organised way of teaching their materials [in such countries]. Possibly, children with maths anxiety prefer there to be fewer surprises, such as being called on to stand up and work out a question on a blackboard.” Prof Margaret Brown, the president of the Maths Anxiety Trust, said: “It shows for the first time that maths anxiety is not just an individual phenomenon which affects maths attainment, but it also strongly correlates with other contextual factors like the pupils’ confidence in their teacher, teachers’ own confidence in their maths, and the amount of homework and parental involvement in completing it. “It is also significant that maths anxiety varies across different countries. England’s results suggest that our secondary students are among the most seriously affected by maths anxiety, and that the effect of factors from both the school and home environment are particularly strong in England. This provides strong evidence that maths attainment in England could be improved by changing our mathematics curriculum, teaching styles and our examination system so that they cause less stress on students, teachers and parents.” Prof Denes Szucs, the deputy director of the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Neuroscience in Education, said: “This study confirms some of the things we already knew about maths anxiety, but using a giant sample.” His team recently interviewed 1,700 UK schoolchildren and found that a perception of maths being more difficult than other subjects often contributed to the problem. Teachers also played a role, with anxious children often reporting being confused by different teaching methods. “The big question is what to do about it,” Szucs said. On an individual level, he recommended trying to disentangle feelings of anxiety from ability. “Our UK research showed that most children who are maths anxious are not actually low achievers, they just feel anxious about maths. Possibly they picked it up from their family or school, but it is not necessarily a justified anxiety.” Mathematics anxiety is officially defined as “a feeling of tension and anxiety that interferes with the manipulation of numbers and the solving of mathematical problems in a wide variety of ordinary life and academic situations”. Extreme maths anxiety is thought to affect 2-6% of UK secondary school pupils, although estimates vary, with another study suggesting that a third of UK apprentices experience “noticeable” maths anxiety, while 19% have a tendency to be anxious but may not show such clear signs. Females tend to express more anxiety about maths than males, although studies have suggested this gender gap does not develop until adolescence. It is separate to dyscalculia, a specific and persistent cognitive difficulty in understanding numbers, although sometimes the two conditions overlap. Maths anxiety does not necessarily correlate with ability: A 2018 study found that 77% of children with high maths anxiety were normal to high achievers on curriculum maths tests. However, it can limit performance in certain situations and contexts. One possibility is that the worries and intrusive thoughts associated with maths anxiety disrupt or compete for cognitive resources that are needed to solve mathematical problems.",News/Education,Teachers and too much homework contribute to maths anxiety – study,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/07/teachers-and-too-much-homework-contribute-to-maths-anxiety-study
2/8/2022,"Headteachers have cast doubt on the government’s efforts to ensure fairness for pupils sitting their GCSEs and A-levels in England this summer, warning that deprived pupils in areas severely affected by Covid will be at an unfair disadvantage as exams return. The warning came as exam boards published advance information about some of the content due to come up in the summer exams, to help teachers and pupils focus their revision. School leaders warned, however, that the information had come too late and would do little to mitigate widely varying levels of Covid disruption in schools across the country.  “It’s very late in the day,” said Caroline Derbyshire, the chair of the Headteachers’ Roundtable and CEO of the Saffron academy trust in Essex, adding: “The extent to which students have been affected is quite different across different parts of the country, which makes it impossible to ensure fairness.” There are also warnings that tens of thousands of pupils could lose out on top grades compared with last year’s results, as the government attempts to rein in grade inflation over the past two years and begin a glided return to pre-pandemic grading. This summer is a transition year, when examiners will be asked to be more generous when setting grade boundaries to provide a safety net for students who might otherwise just miss out on a higher grade, but there will be significantly fewer top grades when results are published in August. On Monday, pupils and teachers were given access to long-awaited details of topics, themes and skills likely to be assessed during the exams. Advance information has been provided for the majority of GCSE and A-level subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. It does not provide exact questions that will appear in exams, however, and is one of a range of measures intended to recognise the impact of the pandemic on learning. Mike Walters, the chair of the Kent Association of Head Teachers, said pupils and staff were glad to have some advance notice of topics, but warned: “The extent to which this really mitigates, when there’s been such different levels of disruption for children in different areas of the country, is questionable.” Glyn Potts, the head of Newman RC College in Oldham, said areas such as the north-west and north-east of England had been more severely affected by Covid over a sustained period than other areas, with high levels of absence among staff and pupils. “I welcome anything that addresses lost learning, particularly for disadvantaged students, but this doesn’t actually do it. I think exams are the fairest approach, but this doesn’t seem to be fair to those students for whom challenges before Covid were then amplified during the pandemic.” Some heads complained there were inconsistencies in the advance content made available by different boards in different subjects, and that some were more useful than others. “Overall I think young people deserved better than this, especially at such a late stage,” said Ben Davis, the headteacher at St Ambrose Barlow RC high school in Greater Manchester. Analysis by the Liberal Democrats suggests about 90,000 pupils could miss out on top grades in their GCSEs and A-levels because of the government’s planned changes. Summer exams are due to go ahead this year after two years of cancellations owing to the pandemic. The teacher-assessed grades that were used instead led to record results for students. The exams regulator, Ofqual, has said it wants to get back to normal grading, but over a two-year period. According to Liberal Democrat analysis, planned changes for this summer could mean that almost 25,000 GCSE pupils miss out on grades 7, 8 or 9, and 66,000 A-level students miss out on As or A*s, compared with under the grading system last year. This year’s results are still expected to be higher than 2019. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said: “Students taking exams this year have had their entire course affected by the pandemic, from the start through to the finish. Lowering grades this year is arbitrary, senseless and heartless when the pandemic is still ongoing. “Our children have worked as hard as they can in incredibly difficult circumstances and their grades should reflect their hard work, instead of being artificially reduced by a thoughtless government.” In addition to the advance information published by exam boards on Monday, the government has introduced adaptations include a choice of topics in some GCSEs such as English literature and history, and support materials such as formulae sheets in maths. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “Exams are the best and fairest form of assessment, and we firmly intend for them to take place this summer, giving students a fair chance to show what they know.”",News/Education,"Return of exams unfair for pupils in deprived areas of England, say heads",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/07/guidance-on-gcse-and-a-level-exams-published-amid-grade-concerns
2/8/2022,"Senior political figures, from Keir Starmer to Sajid Javid, have criticised negative briefings that suggest Carrie Johnson is partly to blame for the troubles of her husband’s premiership. MPs came to the defence of the prime minister’s wife after the publication of extracts from a new book by the Conservative peer Michael Ashcroft which suggested her “behaviour is preventing [Boris Johnson] from leading Britain as effectively as the voters deserve”.  In response, a spokesperson for Carrie Johnson issued a statement saying she “plays no role in government” and had been targeted by enemies of the prime minister in a “brutal briefing campaign”. Boris Johnson’s leadership is hanging by a thread after scandals over No 10 parties – some of which were also attended by Carrie Johnson – and the funding of the No 11 flat refurbishment, which was her project with the celebrity designer Lulu Lytle. But Javid, who Carrie Johnson worked for in the past as an adviser, described some of the attacks on her as sexist and misogynistic. “This whole focus on Carrie Johnson in some of these reports, I think it’s very undignified and very unfair,” said the health secretary. Starmer said people should not be dragged “into the gutter”. The Labour leader said: “I approach politics on the basis that we should treat people with respect. We can profoundly disagree but we should treat people with respect. And I would take exactly that approach with Carrie Johnson. “Obviously, respect differences of opinion, but I do not go along with the idea that we should drag everybody into the gutter.” The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, also waded in, saying: “I don’t think it’s fair or right at all, and I’ll tell you why. I just think as a general rule, a politician’s partner – any politician, any party – should be off limits. “It’s the politician that has chosen to have a public life … I think this whole focus on Carrie Johnson in some of these reports, I think it’s very undignified and very unfair.” Sources have previously told the Guardian that the prime minister’s wife had on occasions tried to have her say on policy issues, particularly on the environment. Former Downing Street insiders said they felt Carrie could make her husband change his mind, sometimes overnight, on an issue they thought was already agreed. The prime minister would also tell aides that if he did not take a particular course of action, it would anger his wife. They also reported Johnson receiving scores of messages from her during the working day – and her repeatedly calling his staff, insisting the prime minister be hauled out of meetings to talk to her. Paul Goodman, the editor of the ConservativeHome website, which is owned by Ashcroft, said on Monday that the idea that the prime minister’s wife had partly prevented Johnson from leading effectively was his “impression of the consensus view in Westminster, at least among ministers, MPs and spads”. However, he also agreed with Carrie Johnson’s defenders that the ultimate responsibility lay with the prime minister. “Whether the charge is true or not, it deflects from the main point. Which is that the prime minister himself, not his spouse, bears responsibility for his decisions,” he wrote. “It would be unfair to blame others for them, even his politically engaged wife. After all, he chooses who he divorces, marries and has children with.”",News/UK news,Senior Tory and Labour figures speak out over media focus on Carrie Johnson ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/07/senior-tory-and-labour-figures-speak-out-over-media-focus-on-carrie-johnson

And I have cut out the picaninnie, watermelon and letterbox gags. Harri: I guess I’d better take the knee then. So I suppose I ought to ask. Are you going to be in the job long? Johnson: (singing) I will survive! … I’ve got all my love to give. Harri: Well I’d be careful about what you do with all that love, if I were you. It’s got you into a lot of scrapes in the past. I’ve warned you before about being sexually incontinent. Not that being sexually incontinent is a bad thing, of course! Johnson: Chance would be a fine thing! I can’t move these days without a couple of plods following me. Do you remember the good old days at the GLA when I could slip off on my bike for some pole-dancing with Jennifer? Harri: Try and concentrate. Back to my original question. How long do you think you’re going to be in Downing Street? Johnson: Why? Harri: It’s complicated … It’s like this. I’m still on the board of the PR company, Hawthorn Advisors, and I only agreed to come over to No 10 as I was told it was basically a holiday job. At worst, something that could take up a six-month sabbatical. Johnson: I see… Harri: The thing is, I’m only here for the laughs. Everyone knows you’re a goner. So I had assumed you did too… Johnson: Er … no. Harri: Right then. I’d better spell it out. Most of the country hates you. The only reason you’re still prime minister is because the Tory MPs are too stupid to work out who to replace you with. So I just thought it would be a bit of a laugh to take on the most impossible communications job going. Then when it all went tits up, I could go back to Hawthorn at double the salary. Johnson: Could we at least pretend that you’re in it for the long term? Harri: You mean, announce that I’m leaving Hawthorn for good even if I miraculously end up back there before the end of the summer? Johnson: Yes! That’s exactly the sort of thing I had in mind. Harri: It’ll cost you. I’ve got my reputation to think of. Can’t be seen to be taking a hopeless cause too seriously. Johnson: I’m sure Lord Brownlow can oblige. But why am I paying you all this money? Harri: Because I’m the only one stupid enough to take the job. Right? That’s sorted. OK so let’s try and do something about your image. Do you think you could get rid of the Toddler haircut? You’re beginning to look like a crumpled Donald Trump. Johnson: Certainly not. The public love it… Harri: Do they now? Not what I’ve heard. Well, we’ve certainly got to wean you off the cake and booze. How is your drinking these days? Johnson: Much better. I now spill most of it. Harri: That’s a start, I suppose. We need to persuade the country that everyone in No 10 isn’t simply coming in to have parties and get pissed… Johnson: Then what will everyone in here be doing? Harri: I dunno. I haven’t worked that bit out yet. I’m more of an image guy. Do the staff in No 10 have to do anything? It might actually be better if they just did nothing. Johnson: Good thought, Guto. I’ll check in with Steve Barclay on that one. Now, how are we going to reconcile the fact that only a few weeks ago you were saying I was completely lacking in morality and that I should offer a grovelling apology for having been out of my head for most of lockdown. Harri: Oh, I don’t think we need to get too bogged down in that level of detail. Thinking about it now, I might have overreacted a little. Besides which, it would be very off brand for you to apologise for anything. We need to play to your strengths. What is it that everyone knows about you? Johnson: That I’m a stud. With … how many children is it now? Harri: Park that thought. What else? Johnson: Er… Harri: It’s that you’re a liar, stupid. I mean, sir. Your USP is that you are pathologically unable to tell the truth. So we need you to double down on the lies. Keep denying you were at parties when everyone knows you were. Keep up the Savile lies on Starmer. Then everyone will be reassured you’ve got your mojo back. Johnson: If you’re sure. Harri: I am. Trust me. The thing is that I know you’re not a complete clown… Johnson: That’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me… Harri: But the public doesn’t. They think you’re a total clown. So we have to show you have the integrity to demonstrate you’re prepared to sack anyone to hang on to your job. Even if it is only for a few weeks longer. Johnson: Gotcha. Which just leaves Brexit? Harri: So when are you going to admit you are an opportunistic chancer who never believed in leaving the EU? Johnson: I’m sure I did… Harri: You didn’t! I was with you when you were London mayor and back then you were an internationalist and pro the EU and the single market. Johnson: I’m sure I never said all that. In any case, it’s all water under the bridge. I’m now going to appoint a minister to promote the benefits of Brexit… Harri: Please don’t… Johnson: Why not? Harri: Because there aren’t any! It will be a disaster for Wales. But I guess we don’t really have to talk about Brexit as nothing much is going to happen before you go… Johnson: Go where? Harri: Don’t start all that again. Since you’ve got no morals, I’m sure I can manage not to have any too for a few months. Brexit is brilliant! There, I said it. Johnson: Tremendous… Harri: Now, I’ve done you a favour. Perhaps you could do me one. Would you be prepared to have another look at Huawei. They really aren’t that bad… Johnson: I’ll think about it… Harri: In the meantime, would you like a new handset? I can get you one with unlimited roaming for nothing. And the camera is fab. Johnson: Something tells me you’re going to be right at home here.

2/8/2022,"A researcher in Venice has found evidence revealing that Marco Polo had a daughter out of wedlock. Agnese is believed to have been born between 1295, the year the merchant and explorer returned to Venice after more than two decades travelling through Asia, and 1298, the year he was imprisoned in Genoa for his involvement in a naval conflict between the two cities.  Polo, who wrote a book about his travels that went on to become one of the world’s first bestsellers, was in jail for a year before returning to Venice and marrying Donata Badoer, with whom he had three other daughters. Marcello Bolognari, a PhD student at Ca’ Foscari University in Venice, said there were “hints of Agnese’s existence” in other Polo family documents, but her last will, recently discovered in Venice’s state archive, provides strong evidence that the explorer was her father. The document, written on 7 July 1319, shows that Agnese, who died in her early 20s, had entrusted her father, Polo, to deliver her will and testament to the priest, Pietro Pagano, at the church of San Felice in Venice’s San Giovanni Grisostomo neighbourhood. “We know for sure he had three daughters and this document reflects that most probably he had another daughter from a previous relationship,” said Bolognari. “We don’t know if he had been married before his second marriage or if the child was born from an affair.” The fact that Agnese had entrusted Polo with her will was proof that he knew of her existence and that the pair had a “strong and trusting relationship”, added Bolognari. Agnese did not name her mother in her will, which Bolognari said could have been a sign that her mother had died. He said Agnese’s will depicted “an intimate and affectionate family life”. She was married with two young children. Polo had three daughters with Badoer – Fantina, Bellela and Moreta. He died in 1324, aged 69.",News/World news,"Marco Polo had previously unknown daughter before marriage, will suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/marco-polo-had-previously-unknown-daughter-prior-to-marriage-will-suggests
2/8/2022,"Warner Bros is being sued by co-financiers Village Roadshow over the hybrid release of the sci-fi sequel The Matrix Resurrections. As with all of Warner’s 2021 titles, the fourth Matrix film was released on the big screen and the company’s streaming service, HBO Max, as a response to the pandemic. A complaint put forward by Village Roadshow claims that the decision destroyed any box office chances in December.  The Matrix Resurrections, which reunited stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, made just $37m in the US and has just crossed $153m worldwide. The budget is believed to be around $190m. The Matrix Reloaded, the highest-performing of the franchise, made more than $740m in 2003. “WB’s strategy not only ensured that The Matrix Resurrections would be a bust at the box office, but it also inflicted serious harm to the entire Matrix franchise,” the suit claims. “There can be no doubt that the abysmal theatrical box office sales figures from The Matrix Resurrections dilute the value of this tent pole franchise as a film’s lack of profitability generally prevents studios from investing in additional sequels and derivative films in the near term.” Reviews for The Matrix Resurrections were mixed on release, with the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw calling it “a heavy-footed reboot which doesn’t offer a compelling reason for its existence”. The film was originally scheduled to be released in April 2022 but was moved to the end of 2021, a decision that the complaint alleges was intended to “create a desperately needed wave of year-end HBO Max premium subscriptions”. Two weeks ago, Warners revealed that HBO Max had gained more than 5 million US subscribers in 2021, up 35% over the past 24 months. Village Roadshow is claiming breach of contract and alleging that Warners is also “devising various schemes” to deprive them of rights to follow-ups to other co-owned films such as sequels to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Edge of Tomorrow. The company has invested more than $4.5bn in a partnership that has lasted for more than 20 years. “This is a frivolous attempt by Village Roadshow to avoid their contractual commitment to participate in the arbitration that we commenced against them last week,” the studio said in response. “We have no doubt that this case will be resolved in our favor.” The suit follows a fractious year in Hollywood as studios released tentpole films on streaming services at the same time as in cinemas as Covid continued to affect audience turnout. Last July, Scarlett Johansson hit Disney with a lawsuit after her standalone Marvel adventure Black Widow went to Disney+ on the same day as its theatrical release, a move she claimed affected box office sales. The studio settled with her in October. Warner’s decision to put its 2021 slate on HBO Max at the same time caused ire among film-makers that have worked with them, including Christopher Nolan and Denis Villeneuve. The studio’s 2022 films will mostly be launched theatrical-only with some possible exceptions.",Arts/Film,Warner Bros sued over ‘abysmal’ Matrix Resurrections release,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/warner-bros-sued-over-abysmal-matrix-resurrections-release
2/8/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has warned against expecting “miracles” in his talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow aimed at fending off a Russian attack on Ukraine. The French president had been upbeat about the chances of finding a compromise over European security that would persuade Putin not to order an invasion but, on arrival in Moscow on Monday, Macron sought to play down expectations.  “We can prevent some things in the short term,” he said in Moscow, but added: “I don’t think there are short-term victories. “I don’t believe in spontaneous miracles. There is lots of tensions, nervousness,” Macron added. Before the high-stakes meeting, ​Moscow had​ also​ sought to temper expectations.​​“The situation is too complex to expect decisive breakthroughs in the course of one meeting​,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.​ ​“​In recent days there has been nothing new on the topic of security guarantees for Russia, our western interlocutors prefer not to mention this topic.​” Macron’s meeting with Putin was part of a frenetic day of diplomacy under the shadow of a possible new war in Europe. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, was meeting Joe Biden at the White House and the country’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was in Kyiv, assuring the Ukrainian government of support. Meanwhile, the US and the EU held talks in Washington on how to keep energy supplies flowing to Europe if Russia turned off the flow of natural gas. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, led the European delegation to Washington to discuss emergency energy supplies to the continent if the pipeline running through Ukraine was severed. “We are living by understanding the most dangerous moment for the security in Europe after the end of the cold war,” Borrell said, giving a new estimate of the Russian military buildup. “Nobody masses 140,000 heavily armed soldiers on the border of a country, at the same time [as questioning] the independence to this country in a way that certainly represents a strong threat,” Borrell said, adding that the Russian troops were not there “to have tea”. He said that European gas prices were already six to 10 times higher than a year ago, adding urgency to the need to diversify energy sources. “When Russia halted gas supplies over a dispute with Ukraine in 2009, people died from the cold. And when energy supplies fail, economies falter,” the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. “We’re determined to prevent that from happening and to mitigate the impact on energy supplies and prices should Russia choose to cut natural gas supplies to Europe more than it already has.” The US and EU are trying to secure short-notice deliveries of liquified natural gas (LNG) and agreements to pool reserves in the face of limits on the supply for the east, as well as LNG supply and infrastructure constraints that make it very hard to make up the shortfall. “It’s clear that from the general nature of the comments from secretary Blinken and high commissioner Burrell that they’re still scrambling in terms of their response to this situation,” said Duncan Wood, vice-president for strategy and new initiatives and the Wilson Center thinktank. In their White House meeting, Biden and Scholz were expected to discuss the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which has been built but not yet opened. At the start of the talks, Biden said the two countries were “working in lockstep … to further deter Russian aggression in Europe, and to address the challenges posed by China and promote stability to vote in the western Balkans.” While the US has been adamant the pipeline would not open if Russia carries out an attack, the German government has been less clear, with Scholz appealing for “strategic ambiguity”. Washington, meanwhile, has been opaque on whether it would seek to stop Nord Stream 2 from functioning even if Putin withdrew his troops. “If we are in the happy situation where there is not a Russian invasion and we are able to move along the diplomatic path, we will continue to engage in conversations with Germany and our European partners about this issue more broadly,” a senior US administration official said before the summit meeting.",News/World news,Macron warns don’t expect ‘miracles’ in talks with Putin over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/macron-warns-dont-expect-miracles-in-talks-with-putin-over-ukraine
2/8/2022,"The NHS has some catching up to do. With 6 million people in England currently on waiting lists, and another 1.5 million in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the mismatch between demand and supply in the health system is one of the most serious problems facing the country. This means it is also one of the biggest challenges for ministers, who know that NHS delays, and the problems including deaths that these cause, will be a huge issue – perhaps the single biggest issue – in the next general election. So it is no wonder that the government is trying to force NHS England’s bosses to fix the problem quickly. Publication of a recovery plan for elective (non-emergency) hospital treatment has already been delayed once. Over the weekend it emerged that a sticking point in negotiations is the deadline that will be imposed for reducing waiting times. Waits of more than two years will have been dealt with by the end of March. But ministers’ demand that waits of more than one year should also be eliminated by March 2024 has met with resistance. That is because the length of time that a person has been waiting is not an indication of their level of need. And if people who have been waiting for a long time for non-urgent treatment are prioritised, then those who are more ill but have been slower to come forward will suffer.  The extent of the delays is nothing short of a scandal. Being told that you may have cancer is highly distressing; the two-week maximum waiting time for patients in these circumstances to see an oncologist exists for a reason. For half-a-million people in England to have waited longer than this, as new research suggests that they have done over the past year, is a sign of a brewing crisis. So are lengthy queues for operations such as hip replacements, which have left thousands of people who ought to have been fitted with new joints trapped in pain and disability. But the NHS is right to push back against unrealistic commitments. Political expediency must not be allowed to trump clinical judgments. And ministers must be prevented from passing the buck, and blame for departmental mistakes, to the NHS. The pandemic has dramatically worsened conditions on the ground, putting unprecedented pressure on primary care and hospitals. But the problems of under-resourcing and lack of long-term planning predate Covid. A health and social care workforce strategy was promised in 2019, as an adjunct to a long-term plan that placed staffing front and centre. But the work done in this area by Dido Harding at NHS Improvement was feeble, and the plan is yet to arrive. An amendment to the health and care bill proposed by Jeremy Hunt, who chairs the health select committee, would have increased transparency by requiring regular updates on vacancies and training places – but the government voted it down in November. Labour should maximise pressure on this point and others, both in the House of Lords and when the bill returns to the Commons. The truth is that Tory resistance to forward planning, as well as insufficient spending, lies at the heart of the NHS’s difficulties. With 100,000 job vacancies, and worrying reports about burnout among staff, Sajid Javid and his colleagues should be listening carefully to health bosses. Instead, they combine a high-handed approach to NHS management with over-enthusiasm for big business – as was illustrated by Mr Javid’s recent decision to force through a deal with the private sector despite warnings about costs. Overall, the conduct of the government suggests that the problems of most interest to it are not those facing the NHS. They are the problems facing ministers and their party.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on repairing the NHS: ministers are the problem | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-repairing-the-nhs-ministers-are-the-problem
2/8/2022,"In the 1992 sci-fi dystopia Snow Crash, the author Neal Stephenson imagined a bleak 21st century where the collapse of the global economy had seen governments fall and their power replaced by a few giant businesses. The book is notable for prescience, anticipating the adoption of what was then seen as outlandish technologies like the wireless internet, cryptocurrencies and smartphones, as well as the rise of the gig economy. But it is the book’s prophetic vision of “the metaverse” that has revived interest in the work. That is because Stephenson described the online virtual reality experience that almost every tech giant today wishes to commercially exploit. Last October, Microsoft announced that users of its Teams online meetings app would be able to turn themselves into avatars – the term Stephenson popularised in Snow Crash – to encourage users into virtual interaction. Days later Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder, rebranded his company as Meta, with a focus on the potential for virtual worlds.  Mr Zuckerberg wants to convince the world that he has found new ways to make money – a quest that has become more urgent since last week it was revealed that the company’s user base may not just have plateaued but is starting to decline. This is in part because many Apple iPhone owners choose to opt out of being tracked by applications like Facebook and younger people prefer to spend time on the Chinese-owned social media network TikTok. Facebook users’ engagement provides the personal data used to target advertising. Mr Zuckerberg’s Meta rebrand is meant to signal that he will improve his firm’s targeting and measurement techniques – and extract more revenue from its users. However, the metaverse may not be the future. The corporate version of social media has been blamed, with some justification, for rotting democracy from within. Because Facebook, Twitter and YouTube loom so large in the public imagination, there exists a “blind spot”, suggests computer scientist Ethan Zuckerman, for alternative models. Yet they are here. Tim Berners-Lee, the web’s inventor, wants to wrest power back from big tech and put people in control of their personal data. Other decentralised platforms – such as Mastodon – make it possible to create online communities with different rules. Progressive Twitter users in India switched in 2019 to mstdn.social after a supporter was suspended. However, the biggest decentralised social network is Gab, which serves de-platformed rightwing extremists. There are also social media platforms built around cryptocurrency/blockchain capitalism, which currently has a prohibitively large carbon footprint. Contributors to such sites are typically rewarded with tokens, theoretically enabling high-quality content to be rewarded. However, this model has its downsides: notably that voting power is proportional to currency holdings. When Steemit, one of the original crypto-sites, was bought out, its new owner used his market power to move it his own blockchain system – precipitating a walkout by users. Mr Zuckerman’s wish is for “lots more social networks” that are explicitly governed by the communities who are working with them and offer tools that give more control over what is seen and how it is seen. He thinks that a period of fertile creativity may produce a new, more cooperative form of social media. One hopes he is right.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on social media’s metaverse: it may remain science fiction | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-social-medias-metaverse-it-may-remain-science-fiction
2/8/2022,"One detail within the hike in energy bills hasn’t received enough attention. While the surge in wholesale gas prices is, by a wide margin, the biggest driver, let’s not overlook the contribution from the cost of clearing up the mess of 29 corporate failures in the sector. Those costs also fall on customers. The infuriating element is charges for lost credit balances – in other words, money taken from customers via direct debit that should have been in place when a supplier failed. In practice, sums have been missing in many instances. Some companies, it seems, have played fast and loose with their working capital arrangements.  Customers of the failed companies do not lose a penny when they are transferred to a new supplier via Ofgem’s “supplier of last resort” mechanism, it should be said. Instead, the missing balances are replaced, as it were, via charges on everybody’s bills. In effect, we all pay for the missing millions. How much are we talking about? So far, not much: only £2.45 per customer (or about £54m in aggregate) was included within the £68 “supplier of last resort levy” that formed part of last week’s near-£700 hike in the price cap. The bulk of the levy covered new suppliers’ weightier costs of buying energy for customers who arrived unexpectedly. But the full extent of the missing balances is still to emerge as numbers are reconciled with administrators’ reports and so on. By the end of the process, we could be talking about serious sums. Chris O’Shea, chief executive of Centrica, owner of British Gas, estimated last October that almost £400m of customer credit had gone. But that was at a point when only 15 rivals had failed. The figure, almost certainly, will be higher now. If these were banks collapsing without customers’ deposits, argued O’Shea, it would be “a national scandal”. Spot on. It’s not as if Ofgem was unaware of the danger. In March last year – so a few months before gas prices surged – the regulator announced it was “concerned that some suppliers may use customers’ surplus credit balances to fund otherwise unsustainable business practices”. That concern was well founded: the predictable car crash happened. MPs on the business and energy select committee could usefully try to force more transparency when Ofgem chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, is one of their witnesses on Tuesday. A few questions: what’s a fair estimate of the missing balances? Is there any hope of recovering any? Why did Ofgem not insist on hard ring-fencing rules years ago? And why will it take until spring to design proper protections? Whatever you do, don’t appoint an insider as your next chief executive, advised Elliott Advisors. Taylor Wimpey has ignored the instruction from the supposedly fearsome New York activist hedge fund. Jennie Daly, currently operations director, will succeed long-serving Pete Redfern, becoming the first woman to lead a major UK housebuilder. In the circumstances, Elliott’s reaction was almost gentle. It said it expects to see Taylor Wimpey “take the necessary steps to deliver improved value for shareholders”, which could be said of almost any company at any time. It now sees the appointment of new non-executive directors as “critical to this process”. Elliott’s restraint is sensible. Boards propose chief executives and there’s no mileage in disputing the principle, especially when you’re merely a “top five” shareholder and decline to say how much you actually control. Besides, Daly, despite her low profile, may turn out to have ideas that Elliott likes. The demand that it had absolutely had to be outsider was always odd if Elliott had nobody particular in mind. Certainly one name touted by others, Dave Jenkinson, was a non-starter. As deputy to £75m boss Jeff Fairburn at Persimmon, he collected £40m a few years ago from the same wildly over-the-top incentive scheme. Taylor Wimpey, underperformer or not, didn’t need that cure. Alan Cook’s position as chairman of LV= has been untenable for a while. The moment came last December when he failed to get sufficient backing from members of the mutual insurer for a takeover by private equity firm Bain Capital. A boardroom clear-out, which swept away half its members on Monday, was inevitable. The survivor is chief executive Mark Hartigan, presumably because somebody has to run the shop while talks take place with fellow mutual Royal London on an alternative deal. If the new negotiations don’t work out, however, incoming chair Seamus Creedon would be well advised to rethink his loyalty to Hartigan – the Bain fiasco was as much his as it was Cook’s.",News/Business,Who pays for lost credit balances at failed energy companies?

2/8/2022,"Ralf Rangnick does not believe Manchester United require an overhaul in the summer window to compete for the title next season despite being 19 points behind Manchester City with 16 games left to play of this campaign. United’s position means it will realistically be a decade at least since they were last league champions. And with the team knocked out of the FA Cup by Middlesbrough on Friday, which follows being eliminated from the Carabao Cup, their trophy drought is set to stretch to six years unless an unlikely Champions League triumph is achieved.  Given all of this Rangnick was asked if the squad required major surgery to challenge for a 21st title next season. “I don’t think so. Overall, the development of the team and its performances the last couple of weeks have improved,” the 63-year-old said. “There are two points of criticism that we have to face regarding the Middlesbrough defeat. One: we wasted too many clear-cut chances – we had 22 shots inside the box, 10 were massive opportunities, and we should easily have been 3-0 up at half-time. It should have been 6-1 or 6-2 by the end. “And the other one is 10 seconds before we conceded, it was a perfect counter-pressing situation inside their half, we took time away from them but not the ball and eight seconds later we were outnumbered in our box. Those are the two things I fault the team with. But we invested a week into the gameplan and many of the things we worked on were shown against Middlesbrough.” The interim manager will include Jesse Lingard and Edinson Cavani in United’s squad for the trip to Burnley on Tuesday after they were granted extra time off and missed the Middlesbrough defeat. Cavani was excused because of jet lag after playing for Uruguay while Rangnick stated Lingard had asked not to be considered in order to clear his head after not being allowed a loan move in January. Lingard, though, subsequently claimed on Twitter that it was the club who wanted him to take the break. Asked if the striker and midfielder will travel to Turf Moor, Rangnick said: “They’re both available and will be part of the squad. Both are top professionals and have been training well. “With regard to Jesse, I have a very good relationship with him, he knows I would have been willing to let him go [on loan] at least until the issue with Mason [Greenwood] came up. He [Lingard] mentioned some personal issues [why he wanted a break]. There are no problems whatsoever between myself and Jesse and vice versa.”",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick says Manchester United can compete for league title next season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/ralf-rangnick-says-manchester-united-can-compete-for-league-title-next-season
2/8/2022,"A tourist from Arizona won $229,000 on a Las Vegas slot machine but walked away unaware of his windfall, due to an error in the machine. It took nearly three weeks for gaming board agents to track him down and enrich him.  On 8 January, Robert Taylor hit a jackpot on a slot machine at the Treasure Island Hotel & Casino on the Vegas strip. But the “slot machine experienced a malfunction that prevented Mr Taylor and casino personnel from realizing that a progressive jackpot had been won”, the Nevada Gaming Control Board said. “By the time an extensive review of the slot machine and the communications technology was completed, confirming the jackpot had been won, Mr Taylor had returned home to Arizona.” The casino struggled to identify its lucky patron. The gaming board launched an extensive investigation that included a review of hours of surveillance footage across numerous properties; witness interviews; a study of electronic purchase records; and analysis of ride-share data obtained by the Nevada Transportation Authority. Eventually, the investigation was able to identify Taylor as the lucky casino patron. He was notified on 28 January, nearly three weeks after his win. “The Nevada Gaming Control Board is charged with the strict regulation of the gaming industry, the protection of the gaming public, and ensuring that the industry benefits the state of Nevada,” said James Taylor, chief of enforcement for the board. “I commend the agents of the enforcement division … for ensuring that the public trust in the gaming industry remains strong by spending countless hours over two weeks to ensure that a patron is awarded winnings owed to him. “I’d also like to thank the Nevada Transportation Authority for their assistance in confirming the identity of the patron. This has been a great example of government working together for the benefit of the public.” Robert Taylor will return to Las Vegas to collect his $229,368.52 jackpot, according to gaming officials. The Nevada gambling industry has recovered since the start of the pandemic. In a report released last month, the state gaming board revealed that casinos “won” – or earned – a record $13.4bn in 2021, compared to $12bn in 2019. “This represents an all-time record for gaming win, beating the previous record set during calendar 2007 which totaled $12.8bn,” board analyst Michael Lawton said. He attributed the success to vaccine rollouts which have reduced capacity limits in casinos, as well as strong gambling demand due to “healthy consumer savings as a result of stimulus payments and the sustained rebound of leisure travel”.",News/US news,"Las Vegas casino tracks down tourist who won $229,000 without knowing",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/las-vegas-tourist-jackpot-winner-slot-machine
2/8/2022,"MPs from all sides angrily rounded on Boris Johnson and accused him of whipping up political poison after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, was set upon by protesters who accused him of protecting the paedophile Jimmy Savile. Johnson provoked widespread fury last week when he suggested Starmer had protected Savile during his time as director of public prosecutions. The comments drew criticism from two former Tory chief whips and prompted the resignation of a long-serving aide.  On Monday, Starmer and the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, had to be bundled into a police car after anti-vax protesters surrounded him near parliament with shouts of “traitor” and “Jimmy Savile”. One witness said a protester carried a hangman’s noose prop, which another protester had joked was for Starmer. Lammy said it was “no surprise the conspiracy theorist thugs who harassed Keir Starmer and I repeated slurs we heard from Boris Johnson last week at the dispatch box. Intimidation, harassment and lies have no place in our democracy. And they won’t ever stop me doing my job.”The former chief whip Julian Smith was among at least seven Tory MPs to criticise Johnson as he described the events as appalling. “It is really important for our democracy and for his security that the false Savile slurs made against him are withdrawn in full,” he tweeted. Calls for an apology also came from Sir Roger Gale, Anthony Mangnall and Tobias Ellwood – Tory MPs who have sent letters of no confidence in Johnson – as well as Stephen Hammond, who has expressed significant concerns about the prime minister. Tory MP Rob Largan also said it was time to defuse the situation. “Words matter. What we say and how we say it echoes out far beyond parliament. It can have serious real world consequences. Elected representatives have a responsibility to lower the temperature of debate, not add fuel to the fire.” Johnson said the behaviour “directed at the leader of the opposition tonight is absolutely disgraceful” but stopped short of apologising for his remarks. “All forms of harassment of our elected representatives are completely unacceptable. I thank the police for responding swiftly,” he said. Labour sources were furious at the incident, though Starmer was unharmed and escorted back to his office within minutes. “Boris Johnson and his cabinet chose to lie down with the dogs – and now the whole lot of them are covered in fleas,” one Labour source said. The row over Johnson’s Savile comments has been cited by a number of Tory MPs who have submitted letters of no confidence in the prime minister, 54 of which must be sent to trigger a vote of no confidence in him. During an exchange in the House of Commons last Monday, Johnson said Starmer was “a former director of public prosecutions, who spent more time prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile”. Starmer did not take the decision personally but had apologised for institutional failings after Savile’s abuse was revealed.Munira Mirza, one of Johnson’s closest aides who headed the No 10 policy unit, quit on Thursday after urging Johnson to retract the comments. Cabinet ministers have also expressed unease at the remarks, including the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, during a national press conference, saying “I wouldn’t have said it”. Other cabinet ministers have defended the remarks – including the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, who called it part of the “cut and thrust” of politics. The incident on Monday night prompted renewed anger from MPs. Labour’s Chris Bryant tweeted that Johnson’s comments were directly responsible for circulating links between Starmer and Savile, which had originally appeared on far-right websites. “This is appalling. People were shouting all sorts at Keir, including ‘Jimmy Savile’. This is what happens when a prime minister descends into the gutter and recycles lies from hard-right conspiracy theorists. Political poison has an effect. Johnson has no moral compass,” he wrote.The shadow minister, Yasmin Qureshi, said: “The PM enabled and actively encouraged this.” Liam Byrne, the MP and former mayoral candidate, said: “The best of this country will always defeat the worst. But now we see clearly the kind of behaviour Boris Johnson is prepared to incite.”The Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, also blamed Johnson for amplifying false claims. “This is what happens when fake news is amplified and given credibility by people who should know better. Solidarity with Keir Starmer and David Lammy. Thank you to the Met officers for their swift intervention.” The health secretary, Sajid Javid, had earlier said it was time to “move on” from the row over Johnson’s Savile comments. “I think we should draw a line under this issue and try to move on because the prime minister has come forward and clarified his remarks.” Johnson is expected to reshuffle his team on Tuesday, including a shake-up of the whips’ office that could see the chief, Mark Spencer, sacked. Chris Pincher, a housing minister and ally of the prime minister, is tipped to replace him. The prime minister will also continue the overhaul of his back office team, after recruiting Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister, as his chief of staff, and Guto Harri, his former spokesperson, as his new director of comms. Henry Newman, the deputy chief of staff, and an ally of Carrie Johnson, is also leaving No 10 to return to a job in Michael Gove’s team. Barclay addressed No 10 staff on Monday saying he wanted to create a “mutually supportive” environment after difficult recent weeks and assuring them his doors is “always open”. He will now divide his time between No 10 and the Cabinet Office, with some of his portfolio distributed to other ministers. Harri was also present at the staff meeting, after drawing criticism from Labour over his previous job for a lobbying firm and a media interview in which he recounted Johnson appearing to make light of his troubles by singing: “I will survive”. Labour called for more scrutiny of Harri’s past work for the lobbying firm, saying: “We can’t have the revolving door from lobbying to government see potential national security issues arise. We need full transparency from Guto Harri about all contact he had with government in his former role as a lobbyist and who his clients were.” Scotland Yard said two arrests were made following clashes between police and protesters on the Victoria Embankment after Starmer was taken to safety. A Met police statement said: “Shortly after 5.10pm on Monday, 7 February, a man who had been surrounded by a group of protesters near to New Scotland Yard, was taken away from the scene by a police car. “A man and a woman were arrested at the scene for assault of an emergency worker after a traffic cone was thrown at a police officer. They have been taken into custody.”",News/UK news,MPs blame Boris Johnson’s ‘poison’ after protesters mob Keir Starmer,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/police-rescue-keir-starmer-after-protesters-surround-him-near-parliament
2/8/2022,"The military train lurched into the rail depot at Kursk on a recent afternoon, carrying more snow-dusted main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and other heavy weapons to within a few hours’ drive by car of the Ukrainian border. At the depot, the flatbed railcars parked between heavy containers carrying chemical products, leaving them visible only from a small pedestrian footbridge overhead. There, military police with red armbands kept watch as locals looked on curiously at the latest arrivals in Russia’s vast military buildup.  A recent trip by the Guardian to the Voronezh and Kursk regions in Russia found a hive of barely hidden military activity as Russian troops continued to position themselves for a potential assault on Ukraine, with the latest reports stating that personnel are being transferred and troops are leaving larger depots for forward staging areas just miles from the border. As fears grew in the west of a possible Russian military incursion, world leaders on Monday met in a flurry of diplomatic activity: Emmanuel Macron headed to Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin, Joe Biden hosted the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Washington DC and a European delegation was in Kyiv. In the UK, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, announced a further 350 troops to Poland as 1,700 US paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne also arrived in the Nato member amid concerns the Ukraine crisis could spill over. On the ground in Kursk and Voronezh, which each sit about 100 miles from the border with Ukraine, the heightened Russian military activity has become increasingly impossible to ignore. As jets roared overhead last week during a military training exercise, locals in Shilovo, a district of Voronezh, were stunned to see a Pantsir air defence missile system emerge into a snowy field right next to the local primary school. (The western military district announced that it was just a training exercise.) In the nearby suburb of Maslovka, months of offloading of tanks, artillery and other equipment at a railway station has put local residents on edge. “My wife came back from her errands yelling about tanks, tanks, tanks,” said Oleg Romanenko, a mechanic and metal shop worker who lives near a main street in Maslovka, named for the 206th Rifle Division that fought in the second world war. “It is hard to walk outside your home and see this and not think a war could happen. Everyone has thought about it, at least.” Videos have begun surfacing of trains carrying Russian troops toward the front, and flight data suggests that troops from Siberia are also being airlifted towards Ukraine. Near the Kursk rail depot, air force officers cycled through a nearby spa hotel, while national guard military convoys seen as potential follow-on forces have been spotted driving through nearby towns as they make their way toward the border. Nonetheless, most of the activity points to the grand scope of Russia’s buildup, where an estimated half of the country’s battalion tactical groups has been moved to staging grounds within striking distance of Ukraine, sometimes just dozens of kilometres away from the border. US officials think that Russia has 70% of the necessary military equipment already positioned in order to launch an attack. “All of our red flags or checkboxes have been ticked in the past couple of weeks,” said a researcher from the open-source Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT), which has tracked Russian military deployments towards Ukraine. Those include the 200th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade, which departed its base above the Arctic Circle last month and which may have been the unit whose arrival was observed by the Guardian. The CIT researcher said their red flags include the movement of airborne troops and national guard troops, and the recent movement of equipment from a large military encampment in the town of Yelnya – he called it an “Oh crap” moment. “The evidence we have strongly suggests that literally every large ground formation of the Russian armed forces is involved in this,” the researcher said. “That’s literally unprecedented,” at least since the Soviet Union, they added. Despite the warning signs, some locals in Maslovka still view the buildup with an air of disregard. Videos of tanks and other weaponry arriving at the railway began to emerge in March and since then many have been convinced that the movement of heavy weaponry is just a defensive posture or a ploy in a high-stakes negotiation with the west. “We’ve got used to it here,” said Marina, a pensioner who was waiting at a bus stop off of the main street. She declined to give a surname. “[Troops] arrive and then in a few days they are gone again. Sometimes you see a few men in uniform. But we generally don’t [interfere], don’t ask questions. These are these kinds of times.” Security has certainly tightened since spring, when a Sky News crew managed to walk on to a new base in the Voronezh region being established for the arriving troops. Now, roads to large encampments in the area have been blocked off, locals said. And CIT researchers said that Russian railways had made it more difficult to track train data, increasing the importance of social media video uploaded to platforms like TikTok. Several people in Maslovka said there had been informal warnings not to speak with media or outsiders about the buildup or movements of military vehicles. At a local grocery store, a shopkeeper shrugged when asked about the tanks that would have been parked 50 metres from her door a few days earlier. “I don’t know anything about that,” she said pointedly and moved into the back of the store. The neighbouring region of Kursk, which until recently had seen relatively little military activity, now had “a massive influx of vehicles and personnel,” wrote Konrad Muzyka in an examination of satellite photography of the region taken earlier this month. Videos taken from social media on Monday showed more tanks being transported south of Kursk by rail toward the border. Analysts said that an attack from this area could threaten the city of Kharkiv just across the border or could continue on to either cut off Ukrainian troops in the east or toward the capital of Kyiv. Kursk is historically associated with one of the largest and bloodiest tank battles of the second world war and some locals said it was unthinkable to imagine being on the frontline of a new conflict. “Everyone is interconnected, especially because of our family ties across the border,” said Larisa Kholtobina, the director of a local museum that focuses on preserving the memory of children who fought in the second world war. “There has been this [difficult] period … But we hope that things calm down.” “It’s just a few hundred kilometres from here” to the border, an assistant added. “We try not to think about it but we know that a war would touch us here too.”",News/World news,"‘Tanks, tanks, tanks’: Russians on the military buildup at Ukraine’s border",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/we-dont-ask-questions-locals-fear-russias-military-buildup-on-ukraine-border
2/8/2022,"After confirming the appointment of Paul Collingwood as interim head coach on Monday England’s extensive post-Ashes overhaul turns next to the playing staff, with an injection of fresh blood expected when the squad for the three-match tour of the West Indies is named on Tuesday. Collingwood, who took charge of England’s squad for their T20 series in the Caribbean last month, takes over on a temporary basis from Chris Silverwood, who was sacked last week following England’s dismal 4-0 defeat in the Ashes.  That chastening experience has brought a slew of changes. Besides Silverwood the batting coach, Graham Thorpe, and England team director, Ashley Giles, also departed – though Joe Root has remained as captain and Collingwood, an assistant coach under the previous regime, will also provide some continuity. The new broom may now be set to sweep through those on the pitch, with Collingwood pronouncing the series that begins in Antigua on 8 March an opportunity to “reset and rebuild”. England’s selection panel – understood to feature Collingwood, Giles’s temporary replacement, Andrew Strauss, and the head scout, James Taylor, with input expected from Root and his vice-captain, Ben Stokes – will meet on Tuesday with much to discuss. Ben Foakes, jettisoned after England’s tour of India last year, is likely to get another chance to stake a claim for the wicketkeeper’s gloves given Jos Buttler’s struggles in the red-ball game, while Durham’s left-handed opener Alex Lees could win promotion to the full squad after captaining the Lions in Australia. Joe Clarke and Josh Bohannon are vying to come into a batting unit that failed to reach 300 in 10 Ashes innings, while the Lancashire seamer Saqib Mahmood could make the transition to the Test squad after impressing for England’s white-ball sides and spinner Matt Parkinson is in contention to bolster the bowling ranks. “I am genuinely excited to be leading the Test team for the tour of the Caribbean. I can’t wait to get started,” Collingwood said. “Having a challenging Test series against the West Indies straight off the back of the Ashes disappointment gives us a chance to reset and rebuild. “Playing Test matches for England is the highest accolade in the game. My objective is to give players clarity, direction and encouragement for them to start building something special. “I have spoken to Joe Root and Ben Stokes, and both are excited and passionate to take the team forward in this new cycle. Although they know it won’t be easy, they have the desire and bravery to do things differently to ensure the team can prosper.

2/8/2022,"My friend Michael Wilson, who has died aged 79, was a linguist who used his skills to enable British ornithologists to access works unavailable in English. Mike and I grew up in Somerset villages separated by the Mendip Hills. Our mutual passion for birds absorbed our time and energy in our teenage years. He excelled at identifying bird calls as he walked the Somerset levels. If he heard an unfamiliar call or song he would doggedly wait, listen, search and commit it to memory.  At 15 our bikes took us to search for a little bittern in some reedbeds beside the A38. We stayed in a truck drivers’ lodge in a dormitory room full of snoring men, to be on site at first light for the best chance to see the elusive bird. Mike was wonderful company, considerate, thoughtful and a prolific note-taker. After O-levels at the Blue school, Wells, in the long hot summer of 1959 we hitched to Scotland with an old Army bivouac to see the first successful nesting of an osprey at Loch Garten. We joined the watch rota set up by the RSPB to look out for egg thieves and record the birds’ feeding behaviour. Mike was the first to eat part of a trout dropped by an incoming bird that we recovered from below the nest. Supervising, Peter Conder, later the RSPB chief executive, fried it up in a pan. Such bonding sealed a lifelong friendship. In the 1970s Mike joined my family’s holidays in the birding hotspots of Cley, Dungeness and the Isles of Scilly. Born in the hamlet of Keward, near Wells, Mike was the son of Violet Hutchinson and Walter Wilson, a dealer in vintage cars who did electrical work for EMI in Wookey. At the Blue school, he was drawn to languages and studied German and Russian at Edinburgh University in 1963. That led to posts teaching English in Minsk and Voronezh, where he got to know many Russian ornithologists. While teaching at Sherborne school and at Hedley Walter school, Brentwood, Mike joined an editorial team under Stanley Cramp, the chief editor of The Birds of the Western Palearctic (BWP), volunteering to translate bird literature from German and Russian. In 1980 he became a full-time team member in the Alexander Library of the Edward Grey Institute, Oxford, to research, write and edit BWP volumes 3-9. It was a joy in 2019 to see Mike receive the Janet Kear Union Medal from the British Ornithologists’ Union in recognition of his distinguished service to ornithology. He is survived by his sister, Penny.",News/Environment,Michael Wilson obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/07/michael-wilson-obituary
2/8/2022,"The United States’ Internal Revenue Service will no longer use third-party facial recognition technology on millions of Americans who use the agency’s website to pay taxes or access documents. The IRS said on Monday it would transition away from using the identity verification company ID.me in the coming weeks and develop a new authentication system that does not use facial recognition. The announcement comes hours after US lawmakers asked the IRS to “halt its plans” to use the technology.  “The IRS takes taxpayer privacy and security seriously, and we understand the concerns that have been raised,” said the IRS commissioner, Chuck Rettig. “Everyone should feel comfortable with how their personal information is secured and we are quickly pursuing short-term options that do not involve facial recognition.” Citing privacy and security concerns, Democratic lawmakers on Monday had said they were “deeply concerned” about the IRS’s deal with ID.me, the face-recognition company that promises to verify taxpayers’ identities with a selfie. “Millions of Americans use the IRS website annually for a variety of vital functions, and, as a result, each of them will be forced to trust a private contractor with some of their most sensitive data,” the lawmakers, Ted Lieu, Anna Eshoo, Pramila Jayapal and Yvette Clarke, said in a letter. “We urge the IRS to halt this plan and consult with a wide variety of stakeholders before deciding on an alternative.” The lawmakers demanded that the agency pause its plans until it addresses concerns raised by Congress and consults with stakeholders in the civil rights and civil liberties communities. Digital rights groups warned using facial recognition systems for identity verification when filing taxes raises myriad privacy and discrimination issues. Studies have shown both technologies ID.me uses in its identity fraud and verification processes – face-matching and facial recognition systems – often misidentify Black and brown faces. The use of such technologies also creates a massive database of information that can be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks or shared with other government entities. Among the personal data the company is collecting are users’ images, “inferred citizenship” based on passport information, voiceprints, location data, addresses, social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, passport-card numbers and more. ID.me said it only shares this user information with government entities in response to a subpoena or other legal request or in the case of an identity theft investigation. “If they switch to another company, a lot of the issues will be the same,” said Caitlin George, Fight for the Future campaign director. “The number of problems just outweigh the benefits. And that’s why we don’t think it should be used at all.” Lieu said that the IRS had failed to justify why it needs to give a third-party contractor access to the biometric data of millions of Americans. “I could do banking transactions right now, without having to have facial recognition. Why does the IRS need to have facial recognition to allow Americans to simply use their portal?”",News/US news,IRS cancels plan to use facial recognition on millions of taxpayers,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/us-lawmakers-urge-irs-halt-plan-facial-recognition-millions-taxpayers
2/8/2022,"My friend Stephen Trudgill, who has died aged 74, was an emeritus fellow of Robinson College, Cambridge, whose work often focused on the interaction of nature with people. Unfortunately Steve died just before the release of his book, Why Conserve Nature?, which examines the varied meanings of nature, climate change, ecological science and nature in literature and art. It should be published shortly.  Described by one friend as a “hippy contrarian”, he pursued certain key themes throughout his career. These he characterised as the “personal meanings of nature, especially the therapeutic aspects in wilderness, nature reserves and gardens, as well as the psychological importance of nature to our wellbeing”. He had a generous and kind nature that was appreciated by generations of students and dons, as well as his neighbours (of which I was one) in the Cambridgeshire village of Hinxton. His slightly stooped frame was a familiar sight in the gardens of Robinson College – he was chair of its gardens committee – and he was often seen checking the footpaths around Hinxton, where he served on the parish council for 23 years. Steve was born in Norwich, where his father, John, was a publisher and artist, and his mother, Hettie (nee Gooch), worked in the Jarrold & Sons department store. After Thorpe grammar school he went to Bristol University, where he had wanted to study botany as well as geography and geology but – because the timetable precluded it – reluctantly took sociology as his third subject. After graduation in 1968, he gained his PhD on the geomorphology of Aldabra Atoll in the Indian Ocean, where he spent several months in 1972. His lecturing began at the University of Strathclyde, before he moved to the University of Sheffield, where he taught soils, biogeography and geomorphology for 20 years. Steve then joined Robinson College in 1996, becoming its first resident geography director of studies and making geography one of the college’s best established subjects. It was at Robinson that his reluctantly undertaken sociology studies proved their worth as he expanded his interest from physical geography to the psychological and social aspects of environmental perception and environmental management. These elements all came together in his course on the social engagement of nature. Outside his university work, Steve was especially proud of the time he spent as a member of the executive committee of the Field Studies Council, helping young people access the countryside. He had a restless curiosity that was reflected not only in his professional life but in many other interests, including as a gardener, birdwatcher, opera lover and amateur artist.

2/8/2022,"The wait for Britain’s first gold medal at these Winter Olympics goes on, but Team GB has become a surprise success off the snow and ice after its opening ceremony kit became a sensation on Weibo, the most widely used social media platform in China.  Reaction to the British team, who wore a Ben Sherman duffle coat and Chelsea boots during the ceremony, reached No 8 on the Weibo Hot Topic section, with the Olympics and the start of the Chinese lunar new year the most popular. Footage of their entrance to the Bird’s Nest stadium has been viewed more than 500,000 times. Such has been the reaction the British embassy has been asked by their followers in China to run a competition to win the kit. Many Weibo users spoke approvingly of the stylishness of the attire, although others wondered whether the athletes felt cold in temperatures that dipped well below freezing. “Everyone else was wearing a down jacket, only Team GB wearing a coat,” said one comment. “This is so English. But really, are you guys not cold?” said another. One user likened the coat to the Hogwarts school uniform. Meanwhile, Team GB have revealed they took equipment to build separate gyms in their three training bases in China – including six Olympic lifting areas, kettlebells, Watt bikes and ski Ergs – as part of a plan to mitigate Covid risk. No British athlete has tested positive for Covid in Beijing, something that would require them facing a spell in a quarantine hotel until they cleared two negative tests over two days.

2/8/2022,"Britain has agreed to send a further 350 troops to Poland, in a move intended to demonstrate that the two countries stand together amid concerns that the Ukraine crisis could spill over into eastern Europe. The deployment was agreed bilaterally – meaning it takes place outside Nato’s structures – and comes a few days after the US announced it would send in 1,700 paratroop reinforcements into Poland.  Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, standing next to his Polish counterpart in London, said the aim was to send a “strong signal” to Russia that the UK and Poland “stand side by side” as Moscow moves up to 30,000 troops to neighbouring Belarus. Mariusz Błaszczak, the Polish defence minister, said he wanted the deployment to take place “as soon as possible” and that he intended the troops would be based “east of the Vistula river”, which runs through the heart of the country. Poland borders both Ukraine and Belarus to the east. Russia has begun sending thousands of troops into Belarus for military exercises this month, which the US and the UK fears could be used as the basis for an invasion of Ukraine – or they may end up being permanently stationed in the country. It is part of wider buildup of an estimated 130,000 Russian troops near Ukraine’s borders. Over the weekend US officials warned that Russia had assembled around 70% of the force needed to attempt an invasion of its smaller neighbour. Labour said it welcomed the deployment, but said “UK leadership has been missing from the top-level diplomacy required” because Boris Johnson has been fighting to survive as prime minister. The party called on ministers to reverse a planned reduction of about 9,500 in the target size of the UK armed forces. “With threats increasing and growing Russian aggression, ministers must halt their plans to cut the army,” the shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said. Britain already has 250 soldiers in Poland, 150 of whom are part of an existing Nato multinational protection force, and 100 of whom are engineers helping Warsaw to strengthen its borders with Belarus. Details about which forces would be sent out were not initially available, a sign that the agreement had been hastily put together and signed off at a meeting between Wallace and Błaszczak at the Ministry of Defence in London. But a few hours after the agreement was announced, the MoD said 350 Royal Marines would fly out to Poland “in the coming days”. British sources indicated the extra forces would not amount to a permanent deployment in Poland. But the UK has already signalled it is willing to base extra forces in eastern Europe, offering to double its commitment to Estonia, where 900 British forces lead a Nato battlegroup. The fact that the agreement was brokered directly between the two countries suggests that Warsaw is anxious about the growing Russian presence in Belarus, which Nato says includes Iskander missiles with a range of up to 500km (300 miles), and S-400 air defence systems. The first US troops, paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne, from the recently announced deployment arrived in Poland over the weekend. Another 4,500 US forces are already in the country as part of Nato and bilateral missions. Further decisions on long-term deployments in eastern Europe are expected to be discussed at a meeting of Nato defence ministers on 16-17 February. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s general secretary, said at a press conference in Brussels with Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda: “We are considering more longer-term adjustments to our posture, our presence in the eastern part of the alliance. No final decision has been made on that, but there is a process now going on within Nato.”",News/Politics,UK to send troops to Poland amid concern about Russian buildup ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/uk-to-send-troops-to-poland-amid-concern-about-russian-buildup
2/8/2022,"For Luke Garrard, it was all about creating a moment, a rush of joy, something to remember for ever and, given the odds against his Boreham Wood team in the FA Cup fourth round at Bournemouth on Sunday, the manager would have taken anything – and especially a goal. Garrard got that and what a story it was for the captain, Mark Ricketts, at 37 years young, when he threaded home a low sidefoot on 38 minutes to give the National League side the lead. Ricketts had not trained from Tuesday to Friday and he did the bare minimum on Saturday as he nursed an injury that needed an injection last Monday.  “Mark was still feeling it after the session on Saturday,” Garrard says. “I said: ‘I don’t care. You’re walking us out at Bournemouth. I don’t care if it’s 15 minutes or 20 minutes. You deserve that.’” Garrard wanted the moment for his players, particularly the stalwarts such as Ricketts; for the fans; for the chairman, Danny Hunter, who has done everything since his takeover in 1999 and, yes, for himself. Why not? “When we scored the first goal, I would probably have taken a 5-1 loss … just to have a moment,” Garrard says. Garrard and everybody connected to the club ended up with so much more and the scenes after the final whistle, when little Boreham Wood had hung on to win 1-0 and set up a fifth-round tie at Everton, featured plenty of people taking leave of their senses. At 11pm the previous night, Garrard had received a FaceTime call from a member of the club’s staff who was already in Bournemouth at a hotel. “There were 30 or 40 fans [outside the hotel] and they were singing my name … incredible,” he says. After 17 years at Boreham Wood, initially as a player and as the manager since October 2015, his bond with the support is unbreakable. Garrard was in tears at full time, partly because he had his wife and two young sons at the stadium, along with other family members and friends. He stayed back at first to allow the players to celebrate in front of the away end but, a little later, he had his moment alone with them. There was a touch of the Jürgen Klopps about his fist pump and their cheers. Boreham Wood, whose players are full-time professionals, have earned roughly £240,000 in prize money from the Cup run. They collected £110,000 in TV money from the Bournemouth tie and, when their shares of gate receipts are factored in, it is believed they have made about £500,000 – with more to come at Everton, particularly if it is televised. “This will fill a small void in a big black hole,” Garrard says, as he reflects on the impact of the pandemic on the club. “But I’ll tell you now that the chairman would pay half a million to have a moment like this. Because he’s saying that he’s coming towards the later stages of his life. “Money is money. He says it to me every time. Don’t worry about the money. He never puts pressure on me to go on a Cup run. But to create those moments …” Garrard is asked whether he shared a moment with Hunter after the match. “I’ve made a fat man happy,” he says, smiling. “And that’s not me … I sound so rude. He says it in his interviews. ‘You make a fat man happy.’” He can be familiar with Hunter, he can poke fun, because they are so tight. “It’s not a chairman-manager relationship. He calls me his sixth son. I just love the man. “There is a pandemic but he paid everyone at the club 100%. He gave everyone £100 a week to pay for their [online] food shopping so they wouldn’t have to go to the supermarkets and risk bringing Covid back to their homes. I was getting unbelievable steak every week. He remortgaged his house [in March 2020 to put the money into the club].” Garrard was impressed by the Bournemouth manager, Scott Parker, who came into the dressing room to congratulate them. “I have to say: ‘Who does that?’” Garrard says. “For him to have that about him after a defeat is incredible.” He has asked Parker whether he can shadow him in training for four or five days at some point. So now for Everton. Now for Frank Lampard and his assistant manager, Ashley Cole. “I’m an Arsenal man so to see Ashley Cole … I probably won’t know how to put two words together,” Garrard says. “Frank Lampard is an England legend, a Chelsea legend. But I’ll be asking him the same thing I did with Scott Parker. ‘Can I come in and shadow you?’ He’s unbelievable. Hopefully he keeps the score under 10. “My players deserve this. They deserve to walk out at Goodison and hear the [Z Cars] music. The hair on the back of my neck has just gone up thinking about the music.” The Boreham Wood story has got all the ingredients for a film so perhaps the nearby Elstree Studios should give it some thought. “That’s nice,” Garrard says. “I’ll have Brad Pitt. He can play me.”",Sport/Football,‘My players deserve this’: Boreham Wood turn focus to Lampard’s Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/07/boreham-wood-lampard-everton-fa-cup-bournemouth
2/8/2022,"The Today programme presenter Justin Webb has been partially rebuked by the BBC after he suggested students were lying when they accused a university professor of transphobia. Introducing Radio 4’s newspaper review last October, Webb said: “And quite a lot of coverage still of Kathleen Stock, the academic from Sussex University who’s been abused by students who accuse her, falsely, of transphobia. She says her union has now effectively ended her career. It’s published a statement of support, not for her but for those who are abusing her.”  Four listeners complained to the BBC that Webb’s use of “falsely” was inaccurate and betrayed a personal opinion. Three also complained of inaccuracy and apparent bias in describing the students who had been protesting against Stock as “abusing her”. Stock left her position as a philosophy professor at the University of Sussex at the end of last year after protests over her views on gender identification and transgender rights. She said she had no choice but to resign after protests from students and opposition from fellow academics. The BBC’s editorial complaints unit ruled that Webb was not sufficiently accurate when he suggested the accusation of transphobia against Stock had been disproved. This was because the “validity or otherwise of the accusation of transphobia are the heart of the controversy”. However, the BBC rejected listener complaints that Webb or the Today programme staff breached impartiality rules by expressing their personal opinions on a controversial subject. Instead, they said the word “falsely” was used by the presenter because he was introducing a summary of a Spectator article by Julie Bindel that was supportive of Stock and criticised “extreme transgender ideology”. The BBC complaints unit also ruled Webb’s description of the student protesters as abusive was accurate because some of the language they had used was “incontestably abusive, irrespective of the merits of the arguments”. Among those who filed complaints to the BBC was Freddy McConnell, a transgender journalist who recently lost his legal battle to register as his child’s father. The public broadcaster has increasingly struggled with how to cover transgender issues, with editorial clashes between staff in the newsroom as well as rolling criticism on social media of specific articles. Last year the BBC withdrew from a diversity scheme run by the LGBT charity Stonewall that provided guidelines on running an inclusive workplace. Executives said that although it did not believe membership of the scheme compromised its impartiality, the perception that it could do so was causing problems for the BBC.

2/8/2022,"It seems a lifetime ago now that Camilla Parker Bowles was a scarlet woman, a mistress so reviled some felt she would never be accepted by the public. This week it was announced that she will become Queen consort when her husband becomes king, in what felt like the final reward for years of being a Good Wife; the kind who supportively, unselfishly and discreetly enables her husband to become the best version of himself. As an anonymous royal source told the Daily Mail approvingly, Camilla saw her job as doing whatever she was asked to do: “You don’t try to shape the role to your advantage. It’s about duty and service.” And if it’s taken three solid decades of self-effacement to transform her from hate figure to national treasure – well, nobody said being a Good Wife was easy, or indeed fun. Carrie Johnson has certainly found it hard going, judging by a new biography from the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft in which her critics portray her as the wrong kind of wife entirely; too meddlesome, too “woke”, too insistent on her husband changing the odd nappy, and altogether too unlike her predecessor, Marina Wheeler, who made his life run so smoothly that he didn’t have to worry about anything (and was duly rewarded for her efforts by being repeatedly cheated on). Poor Boris needs “mothering”, we’re told, not someone nagging him about net zero. Setting aside the fact that portraying the prime minister as a needy manchild does him no favours, the trouble with this reductive nonsense is that as an explanation for his current misfortunes, it simply doesn’t wash.  Wheeler was not some surrendered wife content with reverently rearranging her husband’s sock drawer, but a leading QC and committed Brexiter who argued trenchantly in the run-up to the referendum for curtailing the influence of the European court of justice, and was widely credited with persuading her wobbling husband to back Brexit. (Wifely influence can be surprisingly acceptable in Tory circles, so long as it’s in the “right” direction.) Carrie Johnson, meanwhile, may well have been guilty of using the network she once developed as a special adviser to steer her husband’s government in her preferred direction, but she has become a lightning rod for unfair criticism and downright misogyny. Downing Street can be a lonely place for spouses, but perhaps particularly one dealing in quick succession with the near-death of her husband, two births, a miscarriage and rumours that he might be pining for the last wife, all while trying to find her footing on a very public tightrope. It’s too easy to blame every controversial decision, intragovernment tension or inexplicable U-turn on her whispering in the prime ministerial ear, when all too often the problem is his own ideological slipperiness and strategic preference for chaos. Just as it did in the days of Camilla being pitted against Diana, setting two wives against each other conveniently obscures the role of the man stood between them. All successful marriages are partnerships, and in politics that’s perhaps unusually true. David Cameron would have been a different man without Samantha shaking up some of his assumptions; Theresa May drew confidence from rock-steady Philip. But it is prime ministers who set the direction of their governments and the culture inside Downing Street. Johnson’s hatred of personal confrontation, learned in childhood, leaves him wanting to be all things to all people. While this fuzziness is electoral catnip – who else could have persuaded so many starkly different groups of voters in 2019 that he was simultaneously on all their sides? – it is no recipe for clear leadership internally. Those who have worked for him describe a secretive man, who in an argument leaves both sides with the impression he agrees with them before reneging on one the minute he leaves the room. As prime minister, he is forced daily into making hard choices that reveal either his true convictions or strange lack of them, while the glib half-truths to which he resorts when cornered are quickly exposed. None of that is his wife’s fault. The strengths and weaknesses Johnson exhibits as prime minister are the same strengths and weaknesses evident throughout his career. And to the extent that Carrie has power over his decisions, it can only be the power he allows her to have. Like blaming a mistress for the breakup of a marriage, blaming a wife for a politician’s failures obscures the fact that he’s the one who made a vow to the country – and the one ultimately responsible for sticking to it.

2/8/2022,"There is a long and inglorious history in racing of individual bodies or businesses opting for short-term gain ahead of the broader interests of the sport. But even so the Jockey Club’s decision to sign a five-year deal with the gaming giant Playtech, which was announced last week, feels like a new low. The result, according to Playtech’s casino director, James Frendo, will be “a full range of exceptional and exciting cross-product content”. Or the Jockey Club flogging Playtech some racing-themed wrapping paper for software that mechanically grinds a fixed percentage of turnover from its users, depending on your point of view.  And of all the moments to jump into bed with a gaming company, they have done it now, just before a government White Paper with proposals for reform of the gambling laws which could have a profound impact on the sport’s revenue stream from betting. The ideas that have been floated to reduce gambling-related harm include a blanket ban on advertising, “affordability” checks before customers are allowed to deposit or gamble, which would require punters to hand over extensive banking and financial details to a new regulator, and a monthly cap on gambling “spend” of as little as £100. Where the policy-makers eventually decide to draw the lines remains to be seen, but it has often been compared to a choice between regulating gambling like alcohol or, much more strictly, like tobacco. Racing can cope with the former but it would on a long, slow slide towards oblivion if the government opts for the latter. The fundamental differences between betting, where the odds are fluid and punters can win, and gaming, where the fixed margin is unbeatable, were appreciated and understood by legislation until the 2005 Gambling Act blurred the distinction. The big off-course firms – which had built their brands on betting – were delighted, and they spent the next 15 years raking in billions from gaming machines in “betting” shops until the maximum stake was finally cut from £100 to £2 in April 2019.

This led to what is now a fairly standard business model across the industry. First, use big racing and sporting events, such as the Jockey Club’s crown jewel at Cheltenham next month, to sign up new accounts. Next, use profiling to weed out anyone who promises to be “uneconomic” – they can tell within three bets, apparently. And then push as many of the remainder as possible towards the gaming side of the business, via “free” spins and so on. It is grubby and cynical, and also highly effective. It deters punters from betting on racing – what’s the point if they restrict you the instant you have a decent win? – and, perhaps of most concern, pushes potential problem gamblers towards casinos and slots, where the rapid-fire spin rate could be seen as addictive by design. No one is suggesting that betting, on racing or anything else, is entirely safe for all gamblers, and that needs regulating too. But the problem-gambling rate associated with slots and gaming products is significantly higher. As the Gambling Commission pointed out in 2020, “activities that permit high-frequency participation are more likely to be associated with harm and more readily facilitate problematic behaviour, such as loss-chasing”. The best outcome for racing from the latest review of the gambling laws would be alcohol-style regulation for betting and a tobacco-style regime for gaming. That would require, for instance, complete separation between the betting and gaming sides of a firm’s operation, including separate licences and sites as well as a blanket ban on cross-promotion. The penalty for any breach would be suspension or loss of the firm’s gaming licence, which would help to focus the compliance department’s attention on the importance of sticking to the rules. Nor is there any obvious reason why the real-world £2 maximum spin on the slots should not apply online, too. To reach that point, or somewhere close to it, racing needs to argue for as much regulatory blue water as possible between betting and gaming, and ideally to do so with one voice. Few events demonstrate the difference between betting and its drab, soulless distant cousin quite like Cheltenham, where everything from the backdrop to the wild uncertainty and intensity of the competition adds to the experience. And yet the Jockey Club is willing to hawk the Festival’s name and reputation to a gaming company in return for … well, probably rather more than 30 pieces of silver, but a miserable, unworthy sum all the same. That is the same Jockey Club, let’s not forget, which operates under a Royal Charter that requires it to act for “the long-term good of British racing”. Charlie Boss, the Jockey Club’s chief commercial officer, said last week that “we did some very serious due diligence into the player safety capabilities [at Playtech] and what they offer there”. That they were willing to consider a deal in the first place, however, suggests they either get the difference between betting and gaming but do not think it really matters, or they do not understand it all. It is 10-11 each of two on which would be the deeper cause for concern.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Jockey Club’s Playtech deal feels like a new low,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/07/talking-horses-horse-racing-jockey-clubs-playtech-deal-new-low
2/8/2022,"The discovery of a soundproofed torture chamber believed to have been used by a narcotics gang should remind recreational cocaine users of the consequences of their habits, a Dutch public prosecutor has said. Koos Plooij told a court in Amsterdam that the violence of the drug trade was a “repulsive, but apparently unavoidable” result of the widespread use of illegal drugs in the Netherlands and its neighbouring countries.  “The question is how many people are willing to admit that there is indeed a connection between their cocaine use – whether it is to party, deal with work stress or suppress psychological problems – and the underworld that is happy to answer demand but according to its own rules: corrupting, undermining, tough, sparing nothing and nobody,” Plooij said. The comments were made at the latest hearing in the case of 11 suspects, including an alleged ringleader known as Roger “Piet Costa” P, who are accused of planning to murder rivals at an apparent torture site in Wouwse Plantage in Brabant. Two years ago, police officers, acting on intercepted messages, discovered seven shipping containers in Wouwse Plantage in Brabant, six of which were allegedly used as cells containing handcuffs and legcuffs. In the seventh container was a refashioned dentist’s chair, with straps for tying arms and legs, finger clamps, scalpels, claw hammers, pliers, loppers, pruning shears, gas burners, tie wraps and duct tape. The container was sound proofed. Officers also found a freezer large enough to hold more than one person and a mortar mixing tub which was allegedly going to be used for waterboarding victims. The court heard that a second site in Rotterdam was the operating base for an “arrest team” whose task was to pick up their intended targets and take them to the site in Wouwse Plantage. Prosecutors provided the court with an intercepted message from the suspect known as Piet Costa in which he wrote, “There are a few now and I hope I get the chance to torture them”. A second man, who is terminally ill and not currently on trial, allegedly wrote: “If they don’t cooperate, right in the knee”. The court heard that the wives and children of the alleged gang’s rivals were also in danger of being targeted and “detained under the most barbaric conditions”. In both sites, officer found stolen police uniforms, bulletproof vests and blue flashing lights. Prosecutors called for a 12-year jail sentence for Roger P, known as Piet Costa, who is already facing a jail sentence of 17 years and nine months sentence over a separate conviction. He has been described as a major figure in the drug world. The prosecution said there was nothing to substantiate the claims made by one of the suspects that they believed the containers were being set up for the purposes of growing hemp.

2/8/2022,"Pupils who were sent home to learn remotely during lockdown may no longer feel the same need to turn up for school, according to an Ofsted report, which also cites parents requesting online lessons for their children during term-time holidays. The report comes after an investigation into low attendance in schools, which found the switch to online lessons had “negatively affected” some secondary school pupils’ perceptions of the need to be in school and could be contributing to high absence rates.  Some parents who felt their children had learned well using remote lessons wanted to continue, while others whose children have a history of poor attendance used “possible Covid” as an excuse for absence, sometimes resulting in 10 days off school without a confirmatory PCR test. Others had apparently misunderstood the role of online lessons. “Some parents think that remote education can be provided for non-Covid-related circumstances, such as being on holiday, which leaders have to explain is not the case,” the report says. According to the latest government statistics, attendance in state-funded schools fell to 87.4% on 20 January, with 415,000 pupils off for Covid-related reasons. Pre-pandemic, the overall absence rate in 2018-19 was 4.7%. The report, published by the schools watchdog on Monday, confirmed that the most common reason for higher than normal absences was pupils having Covid, but parents’ and pupils’ anxieties were also having an impact, as well as the shift in attitudes to school among some young people. It also found that some parents were keeping children home unnecessarily after a contact with someone who tests positive for Covid, “finding it hard to move on from the ‘bubble-isolation mentality’”. The report, Securing Good Attendance and Tackling Persistent Absence, follows a call last year by the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, for a close examination into low attendance rates in schools in England. “It appears that the provision of remote education during national lockdowns has negatively affected some pupils’ perceptions of the need to be in school, particularly in secondary schools,” the report states. “There is a sense from some pupils, as one leader explained, that ‘you weren’t fussed when we weren’t in school all that time in lockdown and we did our work at home, so why does it matter so much now?’” it went on. Many schools have continued to make lessons available online because of continuing high Covid rates with many pupils still off sick and isolating. Some pupils have told teachers, however, they would prefer to work at home and can’t understand why they can’t work remotely rather than coming into school. The report says: “Where one pupil has Covid-19 and is receiving remote education, this can affect other pupils’ perceptions: ‘My mate’s home, learning online, so the provision must be there, so why can’t I have it too?’, as one leader put it.” Ofsted said some absences were linked to families who feel they have not had a holiday in a long time, with some taking a previously cancelled holiday during term time, though some schools reported fewer term time holidays. Among other influences, one school leader said some families were affected by reports of rising Covid rates in their local area and kept their children off school as a result. Ofsted’s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said: “There’s no doubt that schools continue to face some very tricky challenges around pupil attendance. But it is clear that leaders who have previously improved pupil attendance have managed to maintain good levels this term by applying the same principle of ‘listen, understand, empathise and support – but do not tolerate [absences]’.”",News/Education,"Pupils in England reluctant to return to school after lockdown, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/07/pupils-in-england-reluctant-to-return-to-school-after-lockdown-says-report
2/8/2022,"The supermarket chain Asda has committed to making its cheapest food ranges more widely available, after the anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe raised concerns that low-income shoppers were facing price increases because they could no longer get hold of them. The retailer said it had taken onboard Monroe’s comments and would stock its full Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges in all 581 food stores and online, increasing the number of customers who have access to the products.  Some of the deals, which include 1kg bags of rice for 45p and tins of chopped tomatoes for 28p, had been taken off the website and removed from some stores as the supermarket streamlined its offer. But last month Monroe pointed out that some shoppers were in effect facing triple-digit inflation because they were no longer able to buy products from these ranges and had to buy more expensive basics. In one example she gave of an unnamed retailer, the cheapest 1kg bags of rice had been removed from the shelves, and the next alternative was a 500g pack costing £1, which worked out at a 344% increase. She added that in her local Asda, the cheapest bag of pasta was no longer a 29p bag from the Smart Price range but an own-brand version costing 70p – a 141% price rise. Asda said 150 value-range products were stocked in 300 stores currently, and by 1 March it would introduce all 200 of them across its outlets. This week it increased the number available online by 100 to 187, and it will add more by the end of the month. Meg Farren, Asda’s chief customer officer, said: “We want to help our customers’ budgets stretch further and have taken onboard the comments about the availability of our Smart Price range made by Jack Monroe. We are taking steps to put our full Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges in store and online to make these products as accessible as possible.” The rising cost of energy bills and food is putting household budgets under pressure, and Monroe raised concerns that headline inflation figures do not capture the impact on those with the least money to spend. She has set up her own index to track the cost of essentials, which she said would “document the disappearance of the budget lines and the insidiously creeping prices of the most basic versions of essential items at the supermarket”. After she launched the campaign last month, the Office for National Statistics said it accepted that every person had their own inflation rate and it would do more to capture the impact of price increases on different income groups. Monroe welcomed the move, tweeting: “Delighted to be able to tell you that the @ONS have just announced that they are going to be changing the way they collect and report on the cost of food prices and inflation to take into consideration a wider range of income levels and household circumstances.”",News/Business,Asda makes cheapest food pledge after pressure from Jack Monroe,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/07/asda-to-make-cheapest-food-ranges-more-widely-available-jack-monroe
2/8/2022,"My mother, Frances Seeley, who has died aged 85 after a stroke, was a primary school teacher who was involved in training staff across Coventry in the Standard Attainment Tests (SATs). The daughter of Florence (nee Weaver) and Oliver Smith, Frances was born in Uckfield, East Sussex, where her parents were in service. During the second world war, her father was away from home with the army for five years and was awarded the Military Medal. The family moved to Coventry, where Frances spent the night of the blitz under a staircase at home, as her baby brother, Robert, had chicken pox and and the family could not get to their shelter.  Her father was demobbed in 1946, but her mother died within a year of his return. Frances passed the 11-plus exam and attended Stoke Park grammar school for girls. The family finances were strained, and, though intellectually able, Frances had to start work. She got a job in the dye house at the textile manufacturer Courtaulds in the city, where her facility to pipette liquids to an amazing degree of accuracy was much admired. In 1958 she married Peter Seeley, who worked at the Morris car factory. As well as bringing up their two children, Frances was endlessly patient and thoughtful in the care of her mother-in-law, who lived with us from 1967 until her death in 1985. In 1968 Frances fulfilled her ambition of training as a teacher, at the Canley College of Education (later merged with the University of Warwick). She chose art and craft as a specialism and was especially keen on pottery and weaving. Her first permanent teaching post was in 1971 at Hollyfast primary school in Coventry, followed in 1977 by Hearsall primary – a school with a much more diverse catchment, where she enjoyed working with children of many cultures, faiths and ethnicities. For many years Frances led the school’s annual camp for children – many of whom had never been away from home. With the introduction of the new Standard Attainment Tests (SATs) from 1989, Frances took the opportunity to put herself forward for this work. She thought that if teachers were going to have to implement the new system, it was better that they heard about it and were trained in it by someone who had real experience in those roles. On retirement in 1994 Frances took up the role of churchwarden for All Saints, Allesley, where she had worshipped for more than 40 years. She was instrumental in bringing about the creation of a woodland burial site alongside the church. She was involved in charitable activities, as a member of St John Ambulance, raising funds for Leukaemia Research and running charity events for the church. Peter died in 2018. After her stroke in 2019, Frances moved to live first with her son – my brother, Chris - and then with me in Nottingham. Frances is survived by Chris and me, and four grandchildren.",News/From the Guardian,Frances Seeley obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2022/feb/07/frances-seeley-obituary
2/8/2022,"The former owner of Norton Motorcycles faces up to two years in prison after pleading guilty to illegally investing millions of pounds of people’s retirement savings into his own businesses. Stuart Garner, who acquired the classic marque in 2008 and was feted by a series of UK government ministers including the MP Stephen Barclay, the prime minister’s new chief of staff since Saturday, admitted three offences at Derby magistrates court on Monday.  Garner will be sentenced at the end of the month, when he faces a maximum of two years in prison or an unlimited fine. The admission comes after pension holders had been complaining for years that the businessman had repeatedly ignored their requests to return their retirement savings. It also follows a 2020 Guardian and ITV News investigation that showed how more than 200 “ordinary working people” had had their entire pension pots invested into Norton shares. The motorcycle company slumped into administration in January 2020, leaving the pension fund holders owed about £14m. In June 2020, Garner was ordered to pay the money back after the Pensions Ombudsman ruled he acted “dishonestly”. It is understood the pension holders are still waiting for any of their funds to be returned. On Monday, the court heard that the offences related to three Norton pension schemes, Dominator 2012, Commando 2012 and Donington MC, which had a combined total of 227 members. The investments into Norton breached technical pensions laws preventing more than 5% of an occupational scheme’s value from being invested into assets connected to the employer’s company. Nicola Parish, executive director of frontline regulation at the Pensions Regulator, said: “As a trustee, Stuart Garner failed to comply with restrictions on investments which are designed to protect the funds of pension schemes. Trustees have a vital role in protecting the benefits of members and we will take action where that responsibility is abused.” While the Norton schemes were occupational pension funds, which are usually set up for the benefit of a company’s employees, most of the pension savings were originally invested into Norton during 2012 and 2013 by people with no connection to the motorcycle firm. They were later shown to be victims of a so-called “pensions liberation” fraud, a type of scam when savers are tricked into switching their retirement funds out of established schemes. The case resulted in its promoter, Simon Colfer, being convicted of fraud in 2018 for the way in which he had sold the schemes. Garner has always said he had no knowledge of Colfer’s fraud. Two further Garner associates involved in setting up the Norton pensions schemes – Andrew Meeson and Peter Bradley – were also convicted of a separate tax fraud in 2013, when they reclaimed £5m of tax rebates from fictitious pension contributions. Court documents from that trial state that £990,000 of the proceeds of the tax fraud were loaned to Garner, which he used to originally acquire the Norton brand in 2008. Garner was not implicated in any wrongdoing in the tax fraud case. He did not respond to invitations to comment on Monday.",News/UK news,Ex-owner of Norton Motorcycles faces jail over breaches of pensions rules,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/07/ex-owner-of-norton-motorcycles-faces-jail-over-breaches-of-pensions-rules

You don’t need me to point out the flaws in her arithmetic; that vital work has already been done, not least by young people. We all know that clashes between generations are the stupidest internecine conflicts humanity has ever been able to dream up. The only thing keeping them alive are these regular bulletins from the “things young people should stop buying if they want to afford homes” gazette.  It started in 2016, when an Australian demographer, Bernard Salt, criticised millennials for going to “hipster cafes”; by the following year, this had been distilled down to the quintessential hipster item, the avocado. If only they would forego their fruit/vegetable on toast, they would be able to save for a deposit. Though it started in Australia, this line, like a lie, had got halfway round the world before the truth – that it would take hundreds of years before your daily avocado savings would amount to a house – had got its pants on. Just as any coffee, so long as it was milky and Italian in genesis, came to stand in for “privileged metropolitan”, so the avocado effortlessly swelled to represent “any young person, without any defined range – so, for practical purposes, any person younger than me”. If you had coffee and avocado, that made you a privileged young person, and, therefore, in the world of food symbolism, beneath contempt, politically irrelevant. It didn’t make a whole load of sense, but it made more sense than going after their Netflix subscriptions. It’s a platform you would be as, if not more, likely to associate with the middle-aged, so it just reinforces, surely inadvertently, the underlying message that what the middle-aged have as their birthright, the young will never deserve.

It would be difficult to entertain a more idiotic vision. Florence had no coordination between public expenditure and urban improvement. Taxation staggered from one need to the next. Churches and rich patrons were the prime movers behind all major architectural commissions. Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci deserted Florence for more promising venues. The Medici began to put their hands into the public till even under the 15th-century republic. Any conception of the public good was rudimentary. The political upper class swiftly made its peace with the overmighty Medici in the 16th century. Enough said.Lauro MartinesLondon   Levelling up isn’t just about a new bus route or train line, it’s about rebuilding the foundations of this country’s prosperity. At the heart of levelling up should be the reform of our education system. We need to teach creativity, which helps people solve problems. We need to value engineers and tradespeople such as electricians, plumbers and gas fitters, so we need more focus on those skills at ages of 16-plus. It’s ironic that the person in charge of levelling up is the one who took England’s education system back to learning by rote and destroyed what would really make a difference.Michael SandersLondon  One of the projects that will apparently receive funding in the white paper on levelling up (Report, 2 February) is money for the electrification of the Midland mainline north from Bedford to Sheffield. Some 15 years ago, I was a member of South Yorkshire Passenger Transport and I can remember councillors welcoming the news that the rail line up to Sheffield was to be electrified. Since then, this announcement has been trotted out a number of times, with a lengthy hiatus when we were promised an extension to the city from the proposed HS2 route to Leeds instead. Work is finally beginning on electrifying the line from Bedford to Market Harborough. Yet again, we are faced with a recycled project with recycled funds, the eventual completion of which stretches further and further into the future.Sylvia DunkleySheffield  Lisa Nandy is right to point to the vacuum at the heart of the levelling-up plans. Tagged on to the prosperous south-east, the Isle of Wight has been underfunded for decades in terms of money per pupil. We have had a gutful of education change and boast such a mosaic of secondary provision that it lacks coherence. Local housing is well beyond the means of residents thanks to second homes and holiday lets cornering the market. Our ferry links remain among the most expensive in the world. We are deprived of subsidies enjoyed by other coastal crossings. This has led to higher prices and less frequent crossings, which have affected social mobility and trade. We don’t need more of the same tired policies.

Those of us who have written to our local Conservative MPs about our distress at partygate and the flouting of rules seem to all have received replies with common phrases indicating that action is being taken to improve the operation at No 10. Not one word of contrition or recognition of the prime minister’s individual failings and personal responsibility.  In almost every conversation I have these days, both young and old share shock at the nonsense going on in parliament, and anxieties about the economic crisis, the rising cost of living and how they are going to manage. While this prime minister and his government bluster on, it is the rest of us who will experience the slow bleed of increasing prices, increased taxes, real incomes falling, further diminished public services and the removal of a safety net to catch us when we fall. All this government offers are sticking plasters when what we really need is major surgery.Peter RiddleWirksworth, Derbyshire  Nesrine Malik emphasises the need for the survival of some sort of credible Conservative party. Those of us who have never voted Conservative, and never will, should be hoping that the downfall of Boris Johnson does not leave behind a vacuum that a new Nigel Farage (or indeed the old one) will be only too happy to fill.
