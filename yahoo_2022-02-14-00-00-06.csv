Trump told Fox & Friends that his book has sold more than 300,000 copies, despite supply-chain delays. Former President Donald Trump said his presidency was a ""glamorous"" and ""romantic period"" while discussing sales of his recently published picture-book memoir ""Our Journey Together"" on Fox & Friends on Saturday. The former president said he believed the book was selling well because during his presidency, ""our country was thriving. We were just beating everybody."" ""They viewed it as a romantic period, I think, and I think that's really why it's doing so well because there is a lot of romance to the book,"" Trump said on Fox & Friends. —Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 12, 2022 Trump said that this was despite ""all of the vicious hoaxes"" during his presidency, including the Mueller probe and his two impeachments. ""Despite all of that, they view it as a very glamorous time because our country was doing so well, and we were respected. Putin respected us, and President Xi of China respected us. Kim Jong-un respected us. They all did. I tell you, Iran really respected us,"" Trump said. ""People viewed it as a very beautiful and maybe romantic time in a sense, despite all of the nonsense by the other side, the radical left,"" he said. Speaking on Fox & Friends, Trump claimed his book had sold about 300,000 copies since being published in November, despite delays from supply-chain issues. Trump has reportedly earned $20 million from the book, which sells for $74.99 for an unsigned copy or $229.99 for a signed copy. The book, which features photographs from Trump's presidency and campaign along with tweet-like captions written by him, has been largely panned by critics. A review by book critic Ron Charles in The Washington Post said the book ""captures Trump's wandering mind and self-sabotaging bitterness.""

2/14/2022,"The common cold can be caused by over 200 types of viruses, but it's most often the result of rhinovirus, experts say. Once exposed to a cold virus, your body relies on its natural ability to fight it off, and certain key factors can influence just how well your immune system does the job. In particular, studies have shown that how much sleep you get can greatly help or hinder your immune function. Clocking the right amount of rest gives you a fighting chance against colds, while skimping on sleep can leave your body susceptible to sickness. Read on to learn how much sleep makes you three times more likely to develop cold symptoms, and to find out why good ""sleep efficiency"" is just as important. RELATED: If This Body Part Hurts You at Night, See Your Doctor. According to a 2009 study published in JAMA Internal Network, your chances of developing a cold triple if you regularly clock under seven hours of sleep per night. After controlling for ""pre-challenge virus-specific antibody titers, demographics, season of the year, body mass, socioeconomic status, psychological variables, or health practices,"" the team found that ""participants with less than seven hours of sleep were 2.94 times more likely to develop a cold [when exposed to rhinovirus] than those with eight hours or more of sleep,"" wrote the researchers. The team says their findings can be explained with the help of past research, which has linked the poor sleep to lower immune function, due to ""reduced natural killer cell activity, suppressed interleukin-2 production, and increased levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines."" RELATED: If You Dream About This, Call Your Doctor Immediately. Sleep efficiency is the percentage of time spent asleep while in bed, and it's another way to measure one's quantity and quality of sleep. Experts from the Hypersomnia Foundation write that one's sleep efficiency ""is calculated by dividing the amount of time spent asleep (in minutes) by the total amount of time in bed (in minutes). A normal sleep efficiency is considered to be 85 percent or higher,"" they note. As it turns out, sleep efficiency is even more important than overall hours spent sleeping, say the JAMA researchers. ""Participants with less than 92 percent efficiency were 5.50 times more likely to develop a cold than those with 98 percent or more efficiency,"" the team wrote. ""Poorer sleep efficiency and shorter sleep duration in the weeks preceding exposure to a rhinovirus were associated with lower resistance to illness,"" they add. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), getting less than seven hours of sleep per night is associated with higher risk of several chronic illnesses. In fact, the health authority says that those who report short sleep duration (defined as under seven hours) are more likely to experience heart attack, heart disease, stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, arthritis, depression, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes when compared to individuals who report sufficient sleep (defined as seven hours or more per night). Ultimately, the heightened health risks associated with frequent poor sleep can have serious implications. A 2010 study in the journal Sleep, which reviewed data from 1,382,999 individuals across 16 studies, determined that those who slept for less than seven hours per night suffered ""an increased risk of death from all causes.""

While the side effects of poor sleep are well documented, the CDC says that 35 percent of the American population still fails to get adequate rest, clocking under seven hours of sleep per night. ""The percentage [of people getting insufficient sleep] varies considerably by state, from less than 30 percent in Colorado, South Dakota, and Minnesota to more than 40 percent in Kentucky and Hawaii,"" explains the health authority. ""The highest percentages [of people with inadequate sleep] were in the southeastern United States and in states along the Appalachian Mountains. The lowest percentages were in the Great Plains states."" Age also appears to play a role, says the CDC: those over 65 are less likely to report insufficient sleep than those under 65. According to the Sleep Foundation, the symptoms of insufficient sleep include slowed thinking, reduced attention span, poor memory, low energy, poor or risky decision-making, mood changes, and more. Speak with your doctor now if you notice these signs of sleep deprivation to determine whether it's affecting your health, and how to get a better night's rest.

2/14/2022,"Colombia has taken a step toward recovering a long-lost Spanish wreck and its fabled riches, but it may be a rough ride as Spain and native Bolivians have also staked claims to the booty. Maritime experts consider the wreck of the San Jose to be the ""holy grail"" of Spanish colonial shipwrecks. Long the daydream of treasure hunters worldwide, the wreck of the San Jose galleon was first located off Columbia's coast in 2015, but has been left untouched as the government determines rules for its recovery. Colombia was a colony of Spain when the San Jose was sunk, and gold from across South America, especially modern-day Peru and Bolivia, was stored in the fort of its coastal city, Cartagena, before being shipped back to Europe. The Colombian government considers the booty a ""national treasure"" and wants it to be displayed in a future museum to be built in Cartagena. According to a presidential decree released Thursday, companies or individuals interested in excavating the ship will have to sign a ""contract"" with the state and submit a detailed inventory of their finds to the government as well as plans for handling the goods. The uber-loot, which experts estimate to include at least 200 tons of gold, silver and emeralds, will be a point of pride for Colombia, Vice President and top diplomat Marta Lucia Ramirez said in a statement. The treasure could be worth billions of dollars if ever recovered. ""The sums of wealth are invaluable, and the responsibility of the protégés has already been extracted, contributing to the history of Colombia, the Caribbean and the world,"" she said. Long the daydream of treasure hunters worldwide, the San Jose galleon was sunk by the British Navy on the night of June 7, 1708, off Cartagena de Indias. The San Jose was at the time carrying gold, silver and precious stones which were to be delivered from the Spanish colonies in Latin America to the court of King Philip V. Only a few of the San Jose's 600-member crew survived the wreck. ""It makes it very touchy because one is not supposed to intervene in war graves,"" Justin Leidwanger, an archaeologist at Stanford University who studies ancient shipwrecks, told Live Science in 2015. ""Can you pluck treasure off the seabed without disturbing a war grave? I doubt you can. But these are the sort of discussions that will be had."" At the end of 2015, then-Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos announced the discovery of the exact location of the wreck, which was confirmed by the ship's unique bronze cannons with dolphin engravings. Colombia has said it will cost about $70 million to carry out a full salvage operation on the wreckage, which is at a depth of between 2,000 and 3,200 feet. Spain says the wreck is its own, as a ship of state; and an indigenous group in Bolivia, the Qhara Qhara, says the treasure belongs to them, since their ancestors were forced to mine it from what was in the 1500s the world's largest silver mine.
