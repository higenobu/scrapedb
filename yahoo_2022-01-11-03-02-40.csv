1/11/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve has managed to do something that’s rarely seen in the U.S. these days: Get members of the Democratic and Republican parties to agree.

And while they generally welcomed the Fed’s pivot toward a tighter monetary stance and expect price pressures to ease this year, they sounded doubtful that inflation will decelerate as much as central bankers are forecasting. They saw it remaining well above monetary policy makers’ 2% target. Among those chiming in at the three-day virtual conference that winds up on Sunday: Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and ex-White House chief economist Jason Furman -- both Democrats -- and noted monetary economist John Taylor and former Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Glenn Hubbard, who served in Republican administrations. To be sure, not all economists -- especially some on the left -- are raising alarms about the inflation threat and the Fed’s delayed response to it. Nobel Prize laureate Joseph Stiglitz, who was chief White House economist for Democratic President Bill Clinton, called for caution by the central bank. He argued that higher interest rates wouldn’t solve the supply snafus and global shortages that have helped push up inflation. In addition, labor-force participation remains well short of what it could be. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is likely to be pressed about what he intends to do to stem inflation when he appears Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee for a hearing on his nomination by President Joe Biden for another four-year term. Powell, a Republican, won favor from Biden and some other Democrats for his emphasis on the importance of the Fed achieving maximum employment that is broad-based and inclusive. Faster Pace Data due out on Wednesday will probably show that consumer prices rose 7% in December from a year earlier, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That would top November’s 6.8% annual rise and be the largest increase since 1982. Here are some of the points on inflation and the Fed made by a number of well-known economists in panels at the AEA conference: Furman, a Harvard University professor, said he expects inflation to remain elevated this year, with a mean forecast of 3.2% for the core personal consumption expenditures price index. That’s above the median 2.7% forecast of Fed policy makers at their Dec. 14-15 meeting. Meanwhile, Furman saw a 15% chance that inflation will come in higher this year than last. He also averred that the three nominees that Biden is reportedly considering for the central bank’s board “are considerably more dovish than anyone who’s been on the Fed” for a long time. Taylor, whose monetary-policy rule has been a guidepost for central banks worldwide for years, said the Fed is “way behind” the curve. Depending on the assumptions made, he suggested the federal funds rate should be anywhere from 3% to 6%, not the near-zero percent level now targeted by the central bank. Noting that yields on Treasury securities jumped last week, the Stanford University professor predicted seeing “more of that down the road.” Summers, a Harvard University professor and paid contributor to Bloomberg, also foresees Treasury yields rising further. “As the reality of the need for balancing supply and demand becomes clear, interest rates will rise substantially over the next year and a half,” he said. Summers got into a spirited back-and-forth with Stiglitz at the conference, arguing that the Columbia University professor was placing too much emphasis on supply-chain kinks for the run-up in prices. Gregory Mankiw, who was chief White House economist for Republican President George W. Bush, said “a lot” of the increase in inflation could be blamed on temporary dislocations in supply. “We also have a very tight labor market and you’re starting to see it in wage growth,” he said. The Harvard professor, who is now a self-described political independent because of opposition to former President Donald Trump, said that although inflation isn’t going to stay at 7%, he’d be “surprised” if it falls back to 2% very quickly. Former Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder said he still counts himself as a member of “Team Transitory” in the debate over inflation. But Blinder, who served in the White House under Clinton and now teaches at Princeton University, has said it could take some time for “bottleneck inflation” to ease. Fed policy makers have been slow to recognize the bubbling price pressures in their forecasts, he’s added. The soft landing that Powell and his central bank colleagues are trying to engineer for the economy “will require the Fed to be both lucky and smart,” Hubbard told the conference. Pointing to inflationary pressures from rising rents and home prices and increasing wages, the Columbia University professor doubted whether the three quarter-percentage-point rate increases Fed policy makers have penciled in for this year will be enough.

1/11/2022,"Mortgage rates were on the rise once more in the first week of 2022. In the week ending 6th January, 30-year fixed rates increased by 11 basis points to 3.22%. 30-year fixed rates had risen by 6 basis points in the week prior. As a result, 30-year fixed rates held above the 3% mark for an 8th consecutive week. Compared to this time last year, 30-year fixed rates were up by 55 basis points. 30-year fixed rates were still down by 172 basis points, however, since November 2018’s last peak of 4.94%. It was a relatively busy first half of the week on the U.S economic calendar. Key stats included ISM Manufacturing PMI and finalized Markit survey private sector PMIs. On the labor market front, JOLT’s job openings and ADP nonfarm payrolls also drew interest. The stats were skewed to the negative, with the private sector seeing slower growth in December. In spite of the fall in the PMIs, the numbers were not weak enough to raise any red flags. JOLT’s job openings for November had also disappointed ahead of the ADP nonfarm employment change figures on Wednesday, which impressed. In December, nonfarm payrolls jumped by 800,000 according to the ADP. Economists had forecast a more modest 400k rise. While the stats drew plenty of interest, it was the FOMC meeting minutes that drive yields northwards. A more hawkish than anticipated set of minutes that pointed to a more aggressive removal of policy support drove mortgage rates northwards. The weekly average rates for new mortgages as of 6th January were quoted by Freddie Mac to be: 30-year fixed rates increased by 11 basis points to 3.22% in the week. This time last year, rates had stood at 2.67%. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.7 points. 15-year fixed rose by 10 basis points to 2.43% in the week. Rates were up by 26 basis points from 2.17% a year ago. The average fee fell from 0.7 points to 0.6 points. 5-year fixed rates remained unchanged at 2.41%. Rates were down by 30 basis points from 2.71% a year ago. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.5 points. According to Freddie Mac, Mortgage rates increased during the first week of 2022 to the highest level since May 2020 and are up more than half a percent since January 2021. With higher inflation, promising economic growth, and a tight labor market, we expect that rates will continue to rise. The impact of higher rates on purchase demand remains modest so far given the current first-time homebuyer growth. For the week ending 31st December, the rates were: Average interest rates for 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances rose from 3.31% to 3.33%. Points increased from 0.38 to 0.48 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates backed by FHA increased from 3.39% to 3.40%. Points increased from 0.37 to 0.42 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year rates for jumbo loan balances decreased from 3.35% to 3.31%. Points rose from 0.34 to 0.38 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Weekly figures released by the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that the Market Composite Index, which is a measure of mortgage loan application volume, declined by 2.7% from 2-weeks earlier. The Index had slipped by 0.6% in the week ending 17th December. The Refinance Index declined by 2% from 2-weeks ago and was 40% lower than the same week one year ago. The index had risen by 2% in the week ending 17th December. In the week ending 31st December, the refinance share of mortgage activity rose from 63.9% to 65.4%. The share had increased from 63.3% to 65.2% in the week ending 17th December. According to the MBA, Mortgage rates continued to creep higher over the past 2-weeks, as markets maintained an optimistic view of the economy. The 30-year fixed rate increased by 6 basis points to its highest level since April 2021. Higher rates at the end of 2021 caused refinance activity to decline. Refinance demand continues to dwindle as many borrowers refinanced in 2020 and in early 2021. At that time mortgage rates were around 40 basis points lower. The purchase market also finished the year on a slower note. The final week was the weakest since October 2021. While average loan sizes were lower, home price appreciation remains at very high levels. Despite supply and affordability challenges, 2021 was a record year for purchase originations. MBA expects 2022 to be even stronger with total purchase activity reaching $1.74tn. It’s a quieter week ahead on the U.S economic data front. The markets will need to wait until Wednesday for December inflation figures that will be one of the key stats of the week. Following the more hawkish than anticipated FOMC meeting minutes from last week, another pickup in inflationary pressure would likely be a green light for a March rate hike. On the monetary policy front, FED Chair Powell is due to give testimony on Tuesday, which could also move the dial. From elsewhere, inflation numbers from China will also draw interest on Wednesday. Away from the economic calendar, expect COVID-19 news updates to remain a key driver, however.
