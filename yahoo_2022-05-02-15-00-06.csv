5/2/2022,"By Josh Smith SEOUL (Reuters) - Beijing is concerned about the tense situation on the Korean peninsula, China's Korean affairs envoy said as he arrived for talks in Seoul this week, adding that both the symptoms and root cause of tensions needed to be addressed. Amid stalled denuclearisation talks, North Korea has conducted a flurry of weapons tests this year, from hypersonic missiles to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). North Korea had not conducted an ICBM or nuclear weapons test since 2017. Officials in Seoul and Washington say there are signs of preparations for a new nuclear test. The ""legitimate and reasonable concerns of all parties"" need to be acknowledged for there to be a political settlement, Liu Xiaoming, Special Representative of the Chinese Government on Korean Peninsula Affairs, told reporters at Seoul's airport late on Sunday. ""We call on all parties to stay cool-headed and exercise restraint, and we disapprove (of) actions by any party that could escalate tension,"" he said in a summary of his remarks on Twitter. In his first visit to South Korea since taking office in April 2021, Liu is due to meet his South Korean counterpart, nuclear envoy Noh Kyu-duk, on Tuesday. He may also meet representatives of South Korean President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol, who takes office on May 10, Yonhap news agency reported. The United States has pushed for more United Nations sanctions on the North. But China and Russia have signalled opposition, arguing that sanctions should be eased to jumpstart talks and provide humanitarian relief to the impoverished North. The issues on the peninsula can be resolved politically and China will continue to play a ""positive role,"" Liu said. However, the key to resolving the issues is in the hands of North Korea and the United States, he added.

5/2/2022,"A Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles leader was forcibly removed by campus police from a mayoral debate Sunday night at Cal State Los Angeles. Melina Abdullah — a professor at Cal State L.A. and former chair of the school's pan-African studies department — told The Times she was carried out of the room by police officers because she did not have a ticket to the event. Protests about the exclusion of certain candidates from the stage preceded the event, and attendance had been closely monitored, with only a small audience of 40 to 50 people allowed inside the auditorium. Videos shared on Twitter showed police officers dragging Abdullah outside the auditorium. ""Debates should be public ... especially at a public university,"" Abdullah said via text, noting that students, faculty and the public weren't allowed inside ""a near-empty theater."" The university released a statement: ""One person was removed from the debate, arrested, and released at the scene. There were no other arrests. Cal State LA's Department of Public Safety has no comment. The university will provide a statement after a fuller review of the incident."" Abdullah, however, said that police ""were attempting to arrest me"" but did not arrest her at the scene and told her they would be reaching out to her later. Just minutes before the debate, a couple sitting on the back were escorted/dragged off by campus police officers as the women chanted ""This is public university!"" pic.twitter.com/0pnJxuDRB1 — Jeong Park 박종찬 (@JeongPark52) May 2, 2022 Activists have dogged the major candidates in recent months and briefly disrupted a mayoral forum focused on Asian American Pacific Islander issues that was held Saturday in Little Tokyo. Sunday's debate went off without interruption, but Abdullah and at least one other person were forcibly removed from the audience minutes before it was set to begin. Cal State L.A. police did not respond to requests for comment. Protesters did not say what they were calling for but chanted ""Shame on you"" and ""This is a public university"" as candidates looked on. Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of Cal State L.A.’s Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs, which co-sponsored the debate, was seen pacing near the stage as he was informed about 20 minutes before it began that people without passes had entered the area. A Times reporter saw Sonenshein ask campus police officers what options they would have in removing protesters. ""I should have been able to watch the mayoral debate that was happening on my own campus,"" Abdullah said to The Times in a written statement. ""I’m still processing the fact that Raphe Sonenshein, someone who called himself a friend, who I’ve known well since I was in graduate school, called the police and had me forcibly and brutally removed."" Abdullah added: ""I’m processing that as I was yelling for help, that I was being hurt and called for Karen Bass and Kevin De León … two people who have been very close for more than 20 years, they said nothing, not even a simple 'Please put her down,' nor did any other candidate. It’s both hurtful and outrageous."" Sonenshein declined to comment. Agustin Rojas Navarro, 20, a sophomore political science student, said the crowd ran to the other side of the auditorium as Abdullah was being removed, creating a huddle around her to protect her. Navarro said he was disappointed to see Abdullah removed and criticized the restricted nature of the debate. ""I was really interested in this debate, and I was so disappointed at my school for not having a representative here,"" Navarro said. The debate is one of the last major events for the mayoral candidates to make their case before mail-in ballots go out for the June 7 primary. After the debate ended, candidates made statements similar to those they have given about previous disruptions. ""I wish there hadn't been that exchange at the beginning. But by the same token, I think it's really important that everybody is respected,"" said Mike Feuer, L.A. city attorney. ""That includes all the viewers, the candidates and the people of Los Angeles who are entitled to have a debate that isn't interrupted."" City Councilman Kevin de León said everyone has a right to express their views, but they should do it in a ""constructive"" way. ""I think the debate was civil and well-organized,"" said Peter Ragone, spokesman for mayoral candidate Rick Caruso. Abdullah contributed $1,000 to the Bass campaign in December, according to campaign records. Last month, she donated $214 to mayoral candidate Gina Viola, who was not invited to Sunday's debate.

5/2/2022,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — A massive drought-starved reservoir on the Colorado River has become so depleted that Las Vegas now is pumping water from deeper within Lake Mead where other states downstream don't have access. The Southern Nevada Water Authority announced this week that its Low Lake Level Pumping Station is operational, and released photos of the uppermost intake visible at 1,050 feet (320 meters) above sea level at the lake behind Hoover Dam. “While this emphasizes the seriousness of the drought conditions, we have been preparing for this for more than a decade,” said Bronson Mack, water authority spokesman. The low-level intake allows Las Vegas “to maintain access to its primary water supply in Lake Mead, even if water levels continue to decline due to ongoing drought and climate change conditions,” he said. The move to begin using what had been seen as an in-case-we-need-it hedge against taps running dry comes as water managers in several states that rely on the Colorado River take new steps to conserve water amid what has become perpetual drought. “We don’t have enough water supplies right now to meet normal demand. The water is not there,” Metropolitan Water District of Southern California spokesperson Rebecca Kimitch said this week. The agency told some 6 million people in sprawling Los Angeles, Ventura and San Bernardino counties to cut their outdoor watering to one day a week, effective June 1, or face stiff fines. The surface level of another massive Colorado River reservoir, Lake Powell, dipped below a critical threshold in March — raising concerns about whether Glen Canyon Dam can continue generating power for some 5 million customers across the U.S. West. Lake Mead and Lake Powell upstream are the largest human-made reservoirs in the U.S., part of a system that provides water to more than 40 million people, tribes, agriculture and industry in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming and across the southern border in Mexico. In Arizona, falling Colorado River levels have prompted an emphasis on conservation and raised fears of reduced water deliveries to desert areas that include metro Phoenix, Tucson, tribal lands and farms. At Lake Mead, the new pumps are fed by an intake drilled nearer to the bottom of the lake and completed in 2020 to ensure the ability to continue to draw water for Las Vegas, its casinos, suburbs and 2.4 million residents and 40 million tourists per year. The “third straw”  draws drinking water at 895 feet (272.8 meters) above sea level — below a point at which water would not be released downstream from Hoover Dam. Together, the pipeline and pump projects cost more than $1.3 billion. Drilling began in 2014, amid projections that the lake level would continue to fall due to drought. Increasingly dry conditions in the region are now attributed to long-term climate change. Lake Mead, between Nevada and Arizona, reached its high-water mark in July 1983, at 1,225 feet (373.4 meters) above sea level. On Friday, the level was 1,055 feet (321.6 meters) — about 30% full. Some of the steepest cliffs bordering the lake show 170 feet (51.8 meters) of white mineral “bathtub ring.” “Without the third intake, Southern Nevada would be shutting its doors,” said Pat Mulroy, former longtime chief of the Las Vegas-based water authority, who is now a consultant. “That’s pretty obvious, since the first straw is out of the water.” A mid-level pipeline also can draw water from 1,000 feet (304.8 meters). The authority maintains that the Las Vegas water supply is not immediately threatened. It points to water conservation efforts that it says since 2002 have cut regional consumption of Colorado River water by 26% while the area population has increased 49%.",U.S./Associated Press,Vegas water intake now visible at drought-stricken Lake Mead,https://news.yahoo.com/vegas-water-intake-now-visible-161537369.html
