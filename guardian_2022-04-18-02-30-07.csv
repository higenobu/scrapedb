4/18/2022,"The baby clothing and maternity wear retailer JoJo Maman Bébé – whose high-profile customers include the Duchess of Cambridge – has been snapped up by the high street company Next and a group of investment firms. Laura Tenison, who started the business in 1993 from her flatshare kitchen table and turned it into one of the UK’s leading mother and baby retailers, said the new owners had “exciting plans to expand and grow the brand much faster than we ever could, giving us the opportunity to open in new markets”. However, as part of the deal she will leave the business. Next has taken on 44% of the firm’s shares, with the other 56% acquired by investment companies managed or advised by the hedge fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management. The shares were acquired from existing JoJo shareholders including Tenison. In addition to its websites, JoJo Maman Bébé has 87 retail outlets and employs more than 950 people in the UK. The company told staff that the new owners “are keen to keep our stores where they are trading profitably”, adding that going forward “there may be opportunities for more stores [and] new international websites”. The value of the deal has not been disclosed, and it is not known how much Tenison received for her controlling stake in the business. Tenison started the business after a serious car accident while living in France left her laid up in hospital. In interviews she has said her ward-mate was a young mother with two small children, who kept herself entertained by ordering from mail order catalogues. “[Living in rural France] I couldn’t help noticing how well-dressed the children in France were. You’d see them out walking along the beach with their grandparents whatever the weather, with their great waterproof overalls and fishermans’ jackets on, picking things out of the sand,” she told an interviewer in 2020. Having been thus inspired, in 1993 she began the JoJo business from her flatshare in London, with her “warehouse” her parents’ shed in south Wales. The Duchess of Cambridge was pictured several times wearing a white maternity coat from the brand and is also said to have bought a number of items for her daughter, Princess Charlotte. Commenting on the deal, Tenison said: “Growing JoJo from a kitchen table startup to being the UK’s leading specialist boutique mother and baby brand has been my priority for the past 30 years. I’m exceptionally proud of our achievements, and excited by the opportunities this new partnership will offer to the brand’s future.” She told staff that it was important to Next and the other firms “that we retain the brand identity, values and talent, while permitting JoJo to benefit from the economies of scale of their bigger umbrella … Next and DK believe, as we do, that our stores hold a great value to the overall … business.” She added that it would keep its own dedicated website. Gwynn Milligan, who joined JoJo Maman Bébé in 2017 as commercial director, has taken over as chief executive, and the other directors will be staying in their posts. Next said the business would retain its management autonomy and creative independence. Next will also make a £16.3m investment in the brand, funded from its own cash resources. Simon Wolfson, Next’s chief executive, said: “We are excited to see what can be achieved through the combination of JoJo’s exceptional product with Next’s infrastructure and Davidson Kempner as our investment partner.”",News/Business,Next and group of investment firms buy JoJo Maman Bébé,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/17/next-and-group-of-investment-firms-buy-jojo-maman-bebe
4/18/2022,"Boris Johnson has said his long-awaited visit to India this week will focus on “the things that really matter” to the people of both countries, primarily jobs and growth. Although Tory MPs have been talking up Johnson’s role as a leader of the international pro-Ukraine coalition, an advance government briefing about the visit did not mention the war – which has not led to India loosening its close links with Russia. India abstained last month in the United Nations vote condemning the Russian invasion, and the two countries continue to trade with each other. Johnson said on Sunday: “As we face threats to our peace and prosperity from autocratic states, it is vital that democracies and friends stick together. India, as a major economic power and the world’s largest democracy, is a highly valued strategic partner for the UK in these uncertain times. “My visit to India will deliver on the things that really matter to the people of both our nations – from job creation and economic growth to energy security and defence.” Johnson was originally due to visit India in January last year, but that trip was cancelled as the second wave of the coronavirus swept the UK, propelled by the Alpha variant. No 10 tried to reschedule the visit to last April, but that flight was cancelled too, at relatively short notice, after India was struck by its own Covid emergency, triggered by the Delta variant. Johnson was reluctant to postpone, and there were allegations that the government delayed putting India on its travel red list for longer than it should have because Johnson did not want to jeopardise the visit. His visit this week will start on Thursday in Gujarat. No 10 said this would be the first time a British prime minister has visited the state, which is an ancestral home to about half the British-Indian population in the UK. From there, Johnson will visit New Delhi for talks on Friday with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi. Their meeting will cover the UK-India free trade agreement that is currently being negotiated, which it is claimed could boost trade between the two countries by £28bn by 2035, as well as the defence partnership. The UK’s integrated defence and security review, published last year, identified ties with India as a priority relationship, as part of the UK’s tilt to the Indo-Pacific. Johnson is also expected to announce new investment deals, as well as collaborations covering science, health and technology.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson says India visit will focus on jobs and economic growth,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/17/boris-johnson-india-visit-jobs-economic-growth-narendra-modi
4/18/2022,"Acontroversial decision by London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, to allow the demolition of a flagship Marks & Spencer store on London’s Oxford Street is one of the highest-profile instances so far of what is certain to become a wider debate about embodied carbon. This crucial term, which refers to the carbon emissions of a building over its lifetime, urgently needs to be brought into wider circulation. In the UK, buildings are estimated to be responsible for 23% of all emissions. With its millions of Victorian and Edwardian terraces, the UK has some of the oldest housing stock in the world. So the idea of a “throwaway building culture”, as Will Hurst of the Architects’ Journal describes our contemporary attitude to construction, takes some getting used to. But developers, particularly of large-scale projects, routinely look for a blank slate on which to place a new edifice. Demolition is part of what the construction industry does. Emissions calculations are more complicated than in other sectors because of the role played by time. Arguments over the Marks & Spencer decision, and other proposed demolitions such as that of the fire-damaged Assembly Rooms in Derby, arise because short-term and long-term impacts have to be weighed along with other considerations. In environmental terms, the question comes down to whether the benefits of a new, energy-efficient building will offset the emissions of a demolition and construction project. Recycling, refurbishing and retrofitting are the way forward, and architects and engineers have come up with some ingenious solutions. One block of flats in Copenhagen reused the brick walls of a brewery by cutting them into panels. But such innovative examples of reuse aside, Lord Deben, chairman of the UK’s Climate Change Committee, was right to say last year that “we have to learn to make do and mend” as an alternative to pulling down buildings as a matter of course. Such a shift poses particular challenges in the dysfunctional UK, where property price inflation and rent extraction have, to a damaging extent, taken the place of economically productive activity. While the government has promised a new focus on embodied carbon, any shift in the approach taken by the construction industry will require economic incentives. Vague notions of corporate social responsibility will not cut it. Whole-life carbon assessments should form part of every planning process, with decision-makers empowered to reject schemes that do not meet strict standards. Changing the law to remove the tax advantage of new-builds over refurbishments is one obvious step. The size of this undertaking should not be underestimated. But nothing about the struggle against global heating is easy. Like his support for the Silvertown tunnel, Mr Khan’s refusal to prevent the Marks & Spencer scheme sends a worrying signal. The challenge is to make such decisions, and the economic and political conditions that enable them, a thing of the past as quickly as possible.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the future of buildings: make do and mend | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/17/the-guardian-view-on-the-future-of-buildings-make-do-and-mend
4/18/2022,"Developers who are refusing to contribute to the fund set up to fix dangerous cladding will be warned this week they could be blocked from selling new homes. The levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, will explicitly threaten retaliation, citing powers in the building safety bill that would stop uncooperative developers getting planning permission. It is understood that Galliard Homes will be one of the major developers singled out as a potential target for the punitive measures, although other companies are also expected to be named by Gove. Earlier this month Gove, who was tasked by No 10 with addressing the cladding scandal – which has seen thousands of leaseholders face crippling bills for the removal of dangerous cladding – signed an agreement with 35 developers, who collectively agreed to contribute £2bn towards fixing buildings they had a role in constructing. But some developers did not sign up to this supposedly voluntary agreement, and Gove will this week ratchet up the pressure by reminding them that if they continue to refuse, they risk harsh sanctions under legislation about to become law. The building safety bill was introduced to create a new regulatory framework for building safety after the Grenfell Tower fire. But as it was going through its final stages in the House of Lords Gove introduced amendments that would give him the power to stop firms that have failed to sign his cladding pledge from selling homes. Under the bill, which is back in the Commons this week and set to become law very soon, these firms could be blocked from obtaining planning permission, or prevented from getting building control signoff. Ministers believe that even the threat of these sanctions could be enough to deter investors. According to an internal document about the strategy seen by the Sunday Times, officials are arguing that it would be “irresponsible” not to warn prospective consumers of the potential risks. Galliard is one of at least nine large developers that has yet to sign the Gove pledge. They are expected to be given just a few weeks more to comply. Galliard said at the weekend that it had acted quickly on cladding but that, before signing the pledge, it required “certainty” from the government and “a clear and succinct plan for developers, the government, the supply chain and insurers to all work together to find an equitable solution”. Under the Gove plan, in addition to the £2bn from developers to fix their own buildings, the industry will commit a further £3bn for the removal of unsafe cladding though an expansion of the building safety levy, a charge on new residential buildings. In a separate development, it has emerged that Gove is expected to include legislation in the Queen’s speech proposing to change the way developers are expected to fund affordable housing. Under the current system, local authorities can impose section 106 agreements (named after section 106 of the 1990 Planning Act) on developers telling them that, as a condition of getting permission, they must construct a certain number of affordable homes. Gove wants to abandon these arrangements and instead force developers to contribute to an infrastructure fund that could be used by councils. In a recent white paper, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities argued that a new approach was needed because the current system “enables some developers to benefit disproportionately and unfairly from the land they develop”.",News/Business,Firms who refuse to fund cladding repairs could face trading ban,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/17/firms-who-refuse-to-fund-cladding-repairs-could-face-trading-ban
4/18/2022,"Women in the poorest areas of England are dying earlier than the average female in almost every comparable country in the world, according to a damning analysis of life expectancy data that MPs and leading health experts have called “shocking”, “devastating” and “unacceptable”. Millions of women living in the most deprived areas of England can expect to live 78.7 years, almost eight years shorter than those living in England’s wealthiest areas, the Health Foundation has discovered. It is worse than the average life expectancy for women in every single one of the world’s OECD countries except Mexico. The stark analysis, seen by the Guardian, also reveals that the average life expectancy for all women across England and the UK is lower than the global OECD average. The UK ranks 25th out of 38 OECD countries when it comes to the number of years a woman can expect to live. Ministers have repeatedly promised to tackle decades of gender inequality and pledged to “reset the dial” on women’s health as part of their levelling-up agenda. But experts say the findings show the government has a “mountain to climb”, with a “fundamental shift” in policy urgently needed to enable women to enjoy longer, healthier lives. “The government has committed to addressing stalling life expectancy and this has been described as a core part of the levelling up agenda,” said Jo Bibby, the director of health at the Health Foundation. “However, it has so far failed to acknowledge the mountain it needs to climb to bring life chances in the UK in line with other comparable countries.” Women living in the 10% most deprived parts of England have a lower life expectancy than the average woman in countries such as Colombia (79.8 years), Latvia (79.7 years) and Hungary (79.6 years), according to the new study. Globally, only Mexico has a lower overall life expectancy (77.9 years) than women in the poorest parts of England. The analysis also exposes the true scale of health inequalities in England. Life expectancy for women in the poorest areas is well below the UK average of 83.1, the England average of 83.2, and the OECD average of 83.4, the analysis shows. Some of the most deprived areas in England include the local authority areas of Blackpool, Knowsley, Middlesbrough and Liverpool. The least deprived areas include Hart, Hampshire, Chiltern and Rutland. The gap in life expectancy between women in the richest and poorest areas is 7.7 years. Women in the 10% least deprived areas in England live on average 86.4 years – higher than the overall life expectancy for women in any OECD country, except Japan, which has the highest level for all OECD countries at 87.3 years. “When OECD countries are ranked by life expectancy, the UK comes in 25th – a somewhat disappointing showing for the world’s fifth-largest economy,” said Bibby. “However, an even more concerning picture emerges when we look at the gap between the rich and poor. The stark reality … is that the poorest can expect to live shorter and less healthy lives than their richer counterparts.” England is not an OECD member, like the UK, but the Health Foundation compared life expectancy for 2018 in England – as well as the UK – to other OECD countries. It did not examine Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland. The cost of living crisis is likely to further widen the gap between rich and poor, experts say. The pandemic has already hit the finances of millions of families and rising prices will force growing numbers to choose between going without essentials that are vital to living healthy lives – such as heating and food – or going into debt. Clare Bambra, a professor of public health at Newcastle University, who was not involved in the analysis, said it highlighted the “vast scale” of health inequalities in England, which were “likely to worsen through the very real health threats posed by the rising cost of living”. Hannah Davies, the health inequalities lead at the Northern Health Science Alliance, who was also not involved with the research, described the findings as “shocking”. She added: “Inequalities between the richest and poorest in England are morally and economically unacceptable and the devastating impact they’re having on the poorest women is shown here clearly. If the government is to achieve its healthy life expectancy goals it cannot ignore deprivation in the UK and must invest in helping those worst affected by the cost of living crisis through significant, funded support.” Bibby said the government must focus on providing secure jobs, adequate incomes, decent housing and quality education to improve women’s health in the poorest areas, otherwise levelling up “will remain little more than a slogan”. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, said the “shocking figures” showed women were being failed by the government. “Everywhere you look the Tories are letting women down, whether it’s their inability to confront the cost of living crisis, their broken promise to deliver a women’s health strategy or their failure to tackle the entrenched structural inequalities in healthcare that are putting black, Asian and minority ethnic women at risk,” she added.

4/18/2022,"My cousin Charles Weatherley Wall, who has died aged 91 of a chest infection, was a lifelong philanthropist, and the eponymous founder of the Wall Trust, a charity that supports exceptionally talented students in the performing arts who, without financial aid, might not be able to realise their potential. He was born in Liverpool to Vera (nee Potter) and Bob (Robert) Wall, whose marriage in 1921 had linked two prominent Tate & Lyle families. In 1919 Charles’s grandfather Col RF Wall had returned from Gallipoli to be put in charge of the sugar refinery in London, while Charles Potter was the head of the Liverpool works, where Bob was to become assistant manager. Vera served as a nurse during the two world wars. Following Shrewsbury school, which he supported in later life, Charles spent his national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps. He subsequently trained as a chartered accountant with Cooper Brothers (now PWC) and then Deloitte. Later on he had several financial directorships in industry, forming his own firm, Wall & Co, and was latterly a partner at FW Stephens. I remember the day in 1985 when he took early retirement from that company. Arriving for lunch with a wider-than-ever smile, he told me that rather than leaving only a posthumous legacy for dance, drama or music, he had just set up a living legacy for talented youngsters. He spent 30 years as chairman of the Wall Trust. Now, 35 years on, more than 300 Wall scholars have benefited from that decision. Charles took a close interest in each scholar, from holding auditions and monitoring their annual progress through college to attending their professional performances. I recall warmly that if Wall Trust alumni were on tour in my home town he would delight in asking me to meet them. Most Wall scholars have gone on to fulfil their dreams, including actors Daniel Mays, O-T Fagbenle and Bertie Carvel; dancers Thomas Edwards, Stephen Murray and Hannah O’Brien; musicians Ruby Hughes (soprano), Lara Melda (piano), Yevgeny Sudbin (piano) and Clara Andrada (flute). Sir Kenneth Branagh is the current patron of the trust. Predeceased by his brother, Graham, in 2020, Charles had no close family.

4/18/2022,"Nicola Sturgeon has been reported to police after footage showed her appearing to break Scotland’s Covid laws on face masks. A video posted on social media showed the first minister not wearing a mask during a local election campaign visit to a barber’s in East Kilbride, south Lanarkshire, on Saturday. In the mobile phone video Sturgeon, who became first minister in 2014, is seen without a face covering as she speaks to customers and pats the head of a man in a barber’s chair while mimicking the sound of electric clippers. However, in another video posted on her official Twitter account from the same event, she can be seen wearing a tartan face mask as she shaves a man’s beard. Restrictions in Scotland mean it is a legal requirement to wear a face covering in most indoor public places, including shops, public transport and hairdressers. The rules will become guidance on Monday, though they will recommend that people continue to wear masks when appropriate. Sturgeon apologised in December 2020 when she breached Covid rules by taking off her face mask at a funeral wake, describing it as a “stupid mistake”. Voters will go to the polls to elect their local councils in May. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: “We can confirm that we have received a complaint, which is currently being assessed.” An SNP spokesperson said: “The first minister was invited into the barbers during an outdoor visit on the street. Within a few seconds, she realised she hadn’t put her mask back on and immediately put it on.” The Scottish Conservatives’ health spokesperson, Dr Sandesh Gulhane, said the incident showed that Sturgeon was a hypocrite. “The video clearly shows Nicola Sturgeon isn’t practising what she preaches on face masks.

4/18/2022,"A 64-year-old woman has been convicted of aggravated trespass after taking part in a Just Stop Oil protest at a fuel site in Essex last week. Catherine Maclean, of Hurstpierpoint in West Sussex, became the first person to be convicted over involvement in the recent wave of fuel site blockades after admitting the offence at Chelmsford magistrates court on Saturday, Essex police said. She was charged over the incident at an oil terminal in Thurrock on Wednesday. Assistant chief constable Rachel Nolan said: “Sadly, Ms Maclean’s actions means she now has a criminal record. “No one – least of all my officers – wants to see this happen but it is a timely reminder that if you come to Essex to engage in trespass, even though you may see it as protest, you will be arrested, you will be charged and that is likely to lead to a criminal conviction. “We are not anti-protest in any way. Individuals have a protected right to protest but these incidents have unfortunately crossed into criminality and we have been left with no other option but to act and seek authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service to charge people.” Just Stop Oil have been behind organised blockades of fuel terminals in south-east England and the Midlands since 1 April in an attempt to force the government to cut reliance on fossil fuels. The protests in Essex on 13 April focused on the Purfleet oil terminal, the Inter terminal in Grays and the Navigator terminal in Thurrock. The group said it hoped the blockades would “significantly impact fuel availability at petrol pumps across the south-east”. James Skeet, 34, of Drayton Street, Manchester, and Stephanie Aylett, 27, of High Oaks, St Albans, also appeared alongside Maclean during her hearing on Saturday. Both activists denied a charge of aggravated trespass and breach of bail conditions, Essex police said. They were remanded and will appear back at Chelmsford magistrates court next week. So far, 23 people have been charged in connection with the disruption around Thurrock since the beginning of April, Essex police said, and the force has made 461 arrests. The protests in Essex came in the week that campaigners caused rush-hour chaos in west London by clambering on to an oil tanker and forcing the closure of a major roundabout leading to the start of the M4. Four activists glued themselves to the top of an Eddie Stobart fuel tanker at the junction, which feeds traffic from west London on and off the motorway. Off the side of the articulated lorry they had draped flags reading: “Just Stop Oil.” Initially, cars were able to pass the occupied tanker on lanes either side, with many drivers hurling abuse at the protesters. Hours earlier, police raided an anarchist meeting space in east London. The Network for Police Monitoring tweeted that the raid was “attempting to crack down on @XRebellionUK [Extinction Rebellion] and @JustStop_Oil”.
