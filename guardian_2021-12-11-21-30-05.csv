12/11/2021,"Over the past 30 years, I have read and heard David Baddiel’s thoughts on many subjects, including sex, masturbation, religion, antisemitism, football fandom, football hooliganism, his mother’s sex life and his father’s dementia. “I am quite unfiltered,” he agrees, “mainly because I am almost psychotically comfortable in my own skin.” But today I have found the one subject that makes him squirm. How much time does he spend on social media a day? “Oh, um, too much,” he says, his usual candour suddenly gone. What’s his daily screen time according to his phone? “It says four hours, which is a bit frightening.”  I’ve been up to five, I admit. “OK, I’ve been up to five, too, I cut it down a bit now,” he says with a relieved laugh. “I always think, ‘But that’s not fair, you mean I’ve just had [the phone] open!’, like I’m arguing with my phone. You find any justification to do what you want to do. Fuck knows how much time I’ve wasted on Twitter.” He might not be able to quantify the hours, but he can do the wordcount: since 2009, he has sent 65,000 tweets. We are in Baddiel’s book-stuffed house on the edge of Hampstead Heath in London, and his appearance is rumpled yet cerebral, like a well-worn loafer. Also living in the house with Baddiel is his daughter, Dolly, 20, who is studying for a BA in theatre dance with classical ballet specialism, his 17-year-old son, Ezra, who is studying music, and his wife, the writer Morwenna Banks. All around us are souvenirs from Baddiel’s career, which has made him a semi-ubiquitous, Zelig-like figure in Britain over the past four decades: a photo from when he was on early 1990s swotty-but-also-rock’n’roll comedy show The Mary Whitehouse Experience, with Rob Newman, Hugh Dennis and Steve Punt; many more of him with Frank Skinner, from his years as a TV football bloke and with whom, along with the Lightning Seeds, he wrote the England team’s unofficial but undeniable anthem, Three Lions; stacks of his successful children’s books, and last year’s surprise publishing success, Jews Don’t Count, his polemic against modern antisemitism. It is an almost parodic image of happy creativity, a household in which everyone is free to pursue their passions. Yet Baddiel, 57, has spent an unbearable-to-think-about amount of time in it bent over his phone – not writing more books, not admiring his views of the heath, not hanging out with his family, but talking to and arguing with strangers. He is – like millions of others – addicted to social media. Twitter, in his case, and he tweets regularly to his 780,000 followers about everything from news events to the time he accidentally set his glasses on fire in a microwave. But why? “We are living in a very narcissistic time, and what’s the most narcissistic thing you can do? Always have an audience, and that’s what social media gives you,” he says. I tell him that I think of Twitter as being to the 21st century what cocaine was to the 1990s: too many celebrities and media figures are on it, it makes you anxious and angry, but you worry if you quit you’ll miss out on what the in crowd are saying. “That’s true, but it’s also more than that: Twitter, for example, pretends it’s a marketplace of ideas, but it’s not. It’s a marketplace of identities, and you broadcast your identity via political opinion, and the only way you can claim that identity is to be the loudest and the angriest, and to do it in opposition to everyone who thinks differently from you,” he says. He talks in fast, thoughtful paragraphs and I feel as if he’d be happy for us to have a conversation just about anything, as long as I kept up my end and talked about it in an interesting way. He knows that many people roll their eyes about social media, and it’s a snobbery he has little time for. “It’s ridiculous to be high-minded and say it’s not real life when it’s clearly having massive effects on society. It drives a way of thinking, a lot of political agendas and what goes in the newspapers. It’s not a fringe discourse – it’s at the nexus of power,” he says. People who dismiss social media as an irrelevancy, he says, are like people in the 1950s who thought television was a frivolous fad. After all, a book almost entirely about Twitter, Patricia Lockwood’s No One Is Talking About This, was shortlisted for the Booker prize this year. Baddiel thinks a lot about social media. He recently finished touring his live show, Trolls: Not the Dolls, in which he looked at how abusive discourse is being normalised online (the Guardian gave it four stars). Now he has made a sober BBC documentary, David Baddiel: Social Media, Anger and Us, which was born out of a wider interest (he wanted to know how social media is changing the world) and a personal ambition (he hoped making the show would shame him into quitting Twitter. Spoiler: it does, but only very, very temporarily). The documentary has two real strengths: the first is that Baddiel is neither John Cleese nor a Silicon Valley proselytiser, so he doesn’t take either of the usual, simplified stances. “Usually you get, ‘This is just snowflakes tweeting what they had for breakfast’, or ‘This is disempowered people finally getting a chance to speak.’ I don’t think either is necessarily true. The truth is always more complex,” he says. This is where the documentary’s other strength comes in: its contributors. The always interesting philosopher and computer scientist Jaron Lanier is especially good, pointing out the overlap between countries that have seen a rise in populism in the past decade and countries that have Facebook, and I enjoyed commentator Ayishat Akanbi’s description of social media as the place “where the formerly bullied feel justified to bully”. But the one who really goes beyond the generalities to the personal is Baddiel’s daughter, Dolly. Ifirst met Baddiel about 15 years ago through a mutual friend. After that, we would occasionally bump into one another, but the majority of our interactions were – predictably – over social media. A couple of years ago he asked if we could meet for coffee. He wanted to talk because he knew I’d been anorexic as a teenager and his then teenage daughter, Dolly, was in hospital for anorexia, and he was frantic with worry. I didn’t help much; he found my determined optimism about Dolly a little hard to take when it all felt so hopeless to him. But she did, thankfully, recover, and she is in the documentary talking about the part social media played in the development of her illness. It’s the first time she and her father have talked publicly about her anorexia. I ask Baddiel why he never spoke about Dolly’s illness before, given that he talks about everything else. “My process in life is, if something is difficult to talk about, then I will talk about it. But this was Dolly’s thing, not mine, and it was so dangerous while it was going on that I thought, ‘I cannot disturb this in any way that might be counterproductive to her getting better,’” he says. Also, unlike his father’s dementia, which he often tweets about, and his late mother’s infidelity, which he made a live show about in 2016, the brilliant My Family: Not the Sitcom, he couldn’t see a funny side to it. When he asked Dolly if she’d like to be in his documentary, it wasn’t, he says, because he was thinking about her eating disorder. “I thought, I need to speak to a young person who has grown up with social media and I know she’ll have stuff to say about that. It was only when she started talking about the anorexia that I thought, ‘Ah. Of course.’” As he’s recalling this, the front door slams shut: Dolly is home from college. She and her father greet and tease one another – her lateness, his chattiness – with the ease of people profoundly comfortable with one another. But she tells him that she’ll talk to me more easily without him there, so he leaves us alone. Dolly first got into social media in her second year of secondary school. “I think it was Instagram first, where you’d see photos of the popular girls going to parties. Then it was Tumblr and there was already a strong identity politics thing coming through on that. It was the prime social justice warrior era there. So I had these two instances of young people claiming these very different kinds of identity online,” she says. In the documentary, Dolly talks about her generation’s fascination with identity: “We’re so desperate to put ourselves in a box, in terms of sexuality, gender, race, class. I think it feels nice to feel like you have a solid identity when you actually don’t. But attaching yourself to a movement is an easy way to run away from self-hatred.” Did she feel as if she had an identity before she became ill? “It’s hard to say because – and I think this is where the problem lies – you’re not supposed to have a fully realised identity at 13, 14. But I think social media has exacerbated this need to have an identity, because otherwise you won’t be seen and you won’t have a tribe, basically. I think it’s especially damaging when it comes to young and vulnerable people; they’ll see something that slightly aligns with them and they’ll click into it because it provides them with a sense of safety.” Young people are not the only ones who establish their identity online. Baddiel’s Twitter biography is, simply, “Jew”. “That was supposed to be a joke, because the identity is complicated – I’m an atheist, non-Zionist Jew,” Baddiel later says when I point this out. “But people don’t want complicated identities, especially on social media, maybe because it makes them seem nebulous.” And while the identity may have started as a joke, it has arguably become the reality. When researchers in the documentary look up what words appear most often in the abusive tweets sent to him, the main one is “Jewish”. This, more than “comedian” or “football fan”, is how people – at least on Twitter – now primarily see him. Dolly did have a bit of an online identity at 14. She was into David Bowie, so posted a lot about him, and about her love of dance. “I always had something I was obsessed with, and that’s partly because I’m quite an obsessive person,” she says. She had told people when she was younger she wouldn’t develop anorexia, having seen others do so. “But once I was in it, I was chasing it to no end. It’s not just about the eating disorder, but also that subconscious desire to carry out a role in a certain identity. No one goes into it wanting to be anorexic, but that identity part is very insidious, and it can happen without you realising,” she says. Dolly had struggled with some issues before, such as anxiety. But when she was 15, the anorexia bit into her deeply, and soon after that she was diagnosed. This is when social media became a problem, but, while her father is addicted to Twitter, it was Instagram that hooked Dolly. “After I was diagnosed, I entered that online eating disorder recovery space,” she says. Eating disorder recovery is very big on Instagram. A decade or so ago, there were panics over “pro-ana” and “ana-inspo” sites, where people with anorexia egged one another on to lose more weight, and posted photos to display, with pride, their sick bodies. These have largely been shut down by regulators and are replaced with eating disorder recovery accounts. This might seem like a positive shift, but anorexia is generally a competitive sickness and too often “eating disorder recovery” is just an anorexic humblebrag, in which people post proud photos of their frail limbs and nasogastric feeding tubes. “We weren’t allowed phones in hospital, but when I’d come out I’d struggle a lot and look at all this eating disorder content online and become all-consumed with the journeys of strangers,” she says. One day, she texted her father to ask if he’d send her a photo he took of her right after she was discharged from hospital. Unbeknown to him, she wanted to post it along with one taken before she was admitted. “There are a lot of ‘before and after’ photos on anorexia recovery sites, but it was just performative, and I think that’s so applicable to other things about identity stuff online. I wasn’t better, I was just trying to portray a narrative that I’d seen online, the idea that there’s a neat beginning and end to an eating disorder, and it’s not like that. It’s just fake,” she says. Dolly is now in recovery. I ask her how she thinks social media affected her eating disorder. “It didn’t cause it. It annoys me when people blame anorexia on diet culture, because it runs so much deeper and is totally individual. Feeling lost comes from something deeper than social media, but once you are in that mindset and are vulnerable, social media exacerbates it,” she says. Yet, if social media had no good sides, it wouldn’t attract billions of users. Like Baddiel, I use Twitter way too much, and, also like him, I enjoy it because I’ve made new friends on it, stayed in touch with old friends and I’ve read thousands of interesting articles I otherwise wouldn’t have seen. It’s also destroyed my ability to concentrate, caused me overwhelming anxiety, and twice forced me to call the police when I was sent death threats on it. A part of me suspects that one day people will see social media like alcohol: fun in doses, but not to be chugged on all day, and not good for kids. A bigger part suspects that this particular horse has long since bolted. I ask Baddiel if he knew Dolly was so deep into Instagram while she was ill. “Not really, because she became much more secretive. She is not naturally someone who lies, but that is what the disease does.” He gets material and – to a certain extent – enjoyment from the combativeness of social media, but for his daughter it was extremely damaging. Partly this is because he is an adult and she was a child; he was healthy and she was sick and vulnerable; he’s “psychotically comfortable” in his skin, and she very much was not; he’s a public figure and she’s a private citizen. But it’s also because they’re different people. Related, but different. Social media isn’t one thing or the other. You can think it’s important, and also be ashamed of how much time you spend on it. The truth is always more complex. Baddiel knows he wastes too much time on social media, and his family is bewildered by his addiction. “I think, ‘OK, I’ve written a paragraph of my book, so I can reward myself [with Twitter].’ But you’re going to a place of reward that may punish you,” he says. So – I ask again – why? He hardly needs the publicity. Why bother fighting with strangers online? “I don’t do it as much as I used to,” he says, a teeny bit defensively. “But I think, ‘I’m a comedian, I have to respond.’ In standup, I’ve been heckled many times, and I know what it’s like to have abusive men, mainly, shout at me, and I know how to marshal the room against them with comedy, and it feels like it’s the same process on Twitter. But what you don’t get in comedy is 2,000 people telling you to die.” You don’t, but you also don’t have thousands of people instantly telling you how funny you are. Social media hits a very human sweet spot, being two parts narcissism to one part masochism. And sometimes, that balance tips. In the late 90s, when Baddiel was hosting Fantasy Football League with Skinner, he did impressions of the footballer Jason Lee, in which he blacked up. He has since apologised, but many people, especially on Twitter, regularly use it as an excuse to discredit him when he talks about antisemitism. “For people who get a thrill from anger, apologies make no difference. There’s a notion now online that shouting itself has a kind of nobility, that it’s the voice of the disenfranchised,” he says. If Baddiel wasn’t on social media, this embarrassment from his past would have been largely forgotten. Because he is, it has become part of his identity and, online, identities stick. Nonetheless, it hasn’t put him off Twitter. At the end of the documentary, Baddiel comes off Twitter for a few weeks and, almost immediately, he finds that he is sleeping better, feels happier and has improved concentration. Yet, despite all these benefits, he returns to the site. “Partly because of my job of being a performer, and also because I’m frightened of being excluded from the conversation,” he says, and I suspect it’s at least 75% the latter and 25% the former. I, too, am still on Twitter for those same reasons, but also for another: it can be lonely working from home. I miss being in an office surrounded by friendly colleagues. Having Twitter open all day initially felt a bit like that, but since the start of the pandemic, when emotions became even more fevered than usual, it’s felt more like trying to work in a very angry train station at rush hour. So now I rely on a different site for company: WhatsApp, with its small groups of people who are actually my friends. They are at least as funny as strangers on Twitter, and a lot less likely to publicly shame me. According to my phone, I spend just over an hour a day on WhatsApp and 12 minutes a day on Twitter. I can live with that. For a while, following Instagram accounts about anorexia provided Dolly with comfort: her friends from school had no way of understanding what she was going through, and here was a group with whom she could feel kinship. “But even though I was still not in a good way, I made a decision to stop following all these recovery accounts,” she says. She is still on social media, because it’s fun, she says. “I need time to do mindless things, and social media is the perfect vessel for that.” What does she look at online now? She thinks for a few seconds: “Cat content.”  David Baddiel: Social Media, Anger and Us will be shown on 13 December on BBC Two at 9pm.

12/11/2021,"Born in Bristol in 1984, Jayde Adams is a comedian, actor and presenter known for her bombastic storytelling, extrovert aesthetics and operatic abilities. Her debut standup show – written in the wake of her sister’s death from a brain tumour – was nominated for the Edinburgh newcomer award in 2016. This preceded zeitgeist-skewering shows such as The Ballad of Kylie Jenner’s Old Face, as well as a fruitful TV career as a host for Crazy Delicious and Snackmasters, a guest on panel shows such as 8 Out of 10 Cats and a starring role in this year’s acclaimed comedy Alma’s Not Normal. Adams is an ambassador for the charity Brain Tumour Support .  This photograph was taken in Devon Cliffs, a caravan site where working-class people who couldn’t afford to go on planes would take their kids for a holiday. My sister and I would be forced to compete in freestyle disco dancing together. I wasn’t terrible at it, but I was fat. Mum shoved me in skintight Lycra because she didn’t want me to feel different: she wanted to protect my self-esteem, which I had a lot of. My sister, however – slim, athletic, the perfect disco dancer – didn’t have much confidence. So we weren’t that successful, apart from this one time. We danced in these costumes and did so well a tunnel of people were waiting for us when we finished, applauding and going: “Oh my God! You’re amazing!” That was huge for me. I was always lagging behind. On top of that, I was a real people-pleaser who didn’t forge relationships that had any depth. I was desperate for friends, and people would take advantage of that. Jenna was two years older, really popular, and pulled me out of a lot of bad situations. We were a bit like Phil and Grant. One time, a lad at school smacked me in the stomach with a hockey stick. My sister found out, came charging through the corridors and beat seven bells out of him. She used to fight all my battles – so much so that when she died, I didn’t know who or what I was. In 2005, Jenna had a grand mal seizure out of the blue. I was in the second year of a drama degree at what was then the University of Glamorgan. I noticed that my brother Kane had phoned me 17 times – he never, ever calls. When I got through to him he told me Jenna had collapsed in a fit. It happened in the car with my dad and he had to carry her into the hospital. Lucky, it was that daughter; he’d have had to drag me in by my ankles. When Jenna had a biopsy they took out 52% of the brain tumour. It was a major trauma, so she was different afterwards: she used to repeat herself and do things like put her phone in the fridge. A lot of people in her life couldn’t handle the shift and took a step away. Jenna was quite lonely when she died. The last conversation I had with her, she was crying about one of her mates not telling her that she’d got engaged. She ended up living for six more years – she got married, which was important. She didn’t do loads in her life so she got to have that special day; we had the ceremony in the same church we had her funeral in. I’d never tried standup, but when Jenna was ill I started to become aware that I could do it. After her surgery, I was in the hospital with my family, who were all looking really sad while Jenna was in bed. When they popped out to speak to the doctor, Jenna grabbed my hand – quite aggressively, I’ll be honest – and said: “Can you start making everyone laugh? They’re all looking at me like I’m about to die and it’s doing my nut in.” So that’s what I did. I started making jokes. And I haven’t stopped since. Jenna’s funeral was the best standup gig I’ve done in my life. During her eulogy, I made the whole church laugh. It helped that our vicar kept getting Jenna’s name mixed up with mine. She told a congregation of 400 people that Jayde had died and that I was “leaving Jenna and Kane, Mum and Dad”. I turned around and went: “What the fuck is going on?” It brought the house down. I was an absolute mess for about three years after her death. In the end I did drag Shakespeare around Spain. I wasn’t sure what I was doing and felt a bit lost. For a while I thought I could be Adele. I used to do an impression of her when I was performing with the drag queens; thankfully, I found my own shtick. When Lynne [Parker, who runs comedy competition Funny Women] messaged me in 2014 asking me to enter, I decided to go for it – and I won. Then two years later, I went to Edinburgh to do a show about how I found my voice after losing my big sister. Looking back, I wasn’t ready – too many people do standup about their trauma right after it’s happened. When reviewers rock up with their iPads fresh from university, and give you a two-star review for your pain, it does floor you. It wasn’t all bad, though. For the first time it felt as if I’d owned the story of my sister. Everyone was so preoccupied with their own grief that no one ever asked me how I was. So I just did a bloody show where I got to say it. After the fringe, I got booked to do a run at Soho theatre. My parents came to my penultimate gig, but hadn’t told me. That night I did my set in a completely different way; it’s as if Jenna was telling me they were there. At the end of the show, I do this bit about how Jenna was always known as the singer of the family, and how I didn’t know I could sing opera until after she had died. At her wedding, she sang Martine McCutcheon’s Perfect Moment. My parents would disagree with me here – but it wasn’t great. In the show, I do an impression of Jenna. And then I sing Puccini’s O Mio Babbino Caro, and describe how when I sang it to my mum for the first time, she pauses then said: “Your sister was always such a good singer.” After Mum saw me tell that story live, she was livid: “I never said that, Jayde!” I was like, “You bloody well did.” There’s this thing about dead people. This idea that they are special. That they are angels. Especially when they die early – their memory turns them into some sort of noble creature. But Jenna really was, to me. She never gave me any problems – even when I told the boy she was going out with that we shared knickers. She never manipulated me. She just used to sit back and watch me entertain her. If Jenna was alive now, I’m not sure how she would cope with my new world. I don’t think people really understand working-class families. People are so raw and real, and I’ve had to skim off my sides to be able to fit in. You get media-trained and learn how to play the game. That was OK for me – I was always the sister who was a chameleon and could adapt to any social situation. Jenna, meanwhile, never needed to fit in: she was the most alluring person in any room. She couldn’t pretend to be anything other than what she was. Which was an absolute firecracker.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Flashback – Jayde Adams and her late sister, Jenna: ‘I started making jokes at her bedside, and I haven’t stopped since’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/11/flashback-jayde-adams-and-her-late-sister-jenna-i-started-making-jokes-at-her-bedside-and-i-havent-stopped-since
12/11/2021,"On Sunday, Clapton Community FC will become the first seventh-tier side to compete in the third round of the Women’s FA Cup when they travel south to play Plymouth Argyle. By beating Hounslow 3-1 on penalties, the Greater London Premier League club became the first to beat a side from four tiers higher in the competition.  But instead of being rewarded for their success or handed the funds to further support the London club’s impressive development, Clapton have found themselves out of pocket. The huge discrepancy in prize money dished out to teams competing in the men’s and women’s FA Cups means they will earn just £1,250 should they win, contrasting starkly with the £82,000 offered to men’s teams at the same stage. “We’re reaping the benefits of the Women’s Super League being successful,” says Alice Nutman, the club’s captain. “But if you have that success at the top, it means that is going to have a knock-on impact, lower down. We’re going to see increased numbers of girls and young people playing football, and if we don’t have investment at that stage, if we don’t have viable options for them to go into the game, then investing in the top is pointless. Top-down development, trickle-down economics, we know they don’t work, and the same is true in football.” Nutman adds: “We’re not asking for equal pay. That’s a myth. We’re asking for investment in grassroots and we’re asking for spaces in which women and non-binary people are able to play football, which currently do not exist. “Unfortunately, when the FA is the body that banned women’s football for a 50-year period, you then need to do things to reverse that and, at the moment, that’s not happening. For anyone tier three and below that money makes a huge difference. “It means that you’re not living hand to mouth each month. We struggle to pay for our training pitch. That’s the reality of playing grassroots football in this country as a woman.” Set up in 2018 by fans and players unhappy with the direction of Clapton FC, Clapton Community FC is fan-owned and pioneering a different way of doing things. For supporters who have fallen out of love with the commercialism of the game, clubs such as Clapton offer something different and Nutman believes breaking the mould is what women’s football should try to do more often. “That’s the next step for women’s football, to not try and fit the same model. We’re not able to fit the same model because we didn’t play for such a long period of time [due to the ban]. So it’s about how can we get to the same level of eliteness and the same level of engagement in a better way.” Having the ideological engagement in what the club are doing has been vital during their extraordinary FA Cup run. A broad and active fanbase believes in Clapton’s success off the pitch as much as on it. “The positives of us being a fan-owned club means that lots of [the financial difficulties caused by FA Cup progress] have been hidden from the players,” Nutman says. “There’s been lots of squirrelling away behind the scenes in order to get the cheapest possible transport, in order to get some accommodation. That’s organised by people who own and have a hand in the club. Teams who are higher up are in very similar situations, they also don’t have the funding from the FA that is going to make this possible.” In order to meet the soaring costs, not helped by being drawn away in each round, Clapton launched a crowdfunding appeal which exceeded the £3,000 target in two days and is now more than £4,000. “We’re so very, very grateful for everyone,” says Sophia Axelsson, who plays and also leads on financial strategy for the women’s first team. “But it’s also come at a very, very tricky time for us because we’ve also started a fundraiser to build changing rooms at our ground, which we don’t have. Had we been the men, we would have been able to build these changing rooms already with the success that we’ve had. But because we’re women, we have to do fundraisers for literally everything that we do within the club.” Against Hounslow, with the score at 0-0 at the break, belief suddenly filtered through the team. “We didn’t know, before we played the game, that it would be the first time a team had ever done it,” Nutman says. “And I’m glad we didn’t, because that would have added to how nervous we were feeling. “In a similar way to going into this weekend against Plymouth, it looks like something that shouldn’t happen. It looks like something that we shouldn’t be capable of. But the FA Cup means we’re playing 90 minutes, anything could happen. That’s why football is so glorious.” Should they beat Plymouth, the fourth round could see them drawn against a WSL side. “The thought of getting through is us being able to live out the dreams that we had when we were 20 years younger than we are now. Most of the squad are in our 30s,” says Nutman. Axelsson adds: “I would lie if I said that some of our players hadn’t already dreamt about it. Having a home tie against Arsenal and having their team bus rock up at our community changing rooms in Walthamstow would be pretty incredible. “We’d love to continue this journey that we’re on, this adventure, we’re making memories for life. We’re very proud of where we’ve gotten so far. If we could go even further that would just mean the world.”",Sport/Football,Pioneers Clapton tap into fans to beat rivals and bridge women’s money gap | Suzanne Wrack,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/11/pioneers-clapton-tap-into-fans-to-beat-rivals-bridge-womens-money-gap-womens-fa-cup
12/11/2021,"Formula One has sometimes failed to fire the imagination in recent years, but the duel between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen has gripped fans across the world and evoked the sport’s most compelling rivalries. While the drivers have fought on the track across 21 races before Sunday’s showdown in Abu Dhabi, the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, and his Red Bull counterpart, Christian Horner, have acted as figureheads for their respective teams. When they speak it is not only for the drivers but the pit crews, engineers and mechanics, designers and hundreds of factory staff.  Horner is the longest-serving principal in F1, in charge at Red Bull since 2005. Wolff has been with Mercedes since 2013. Both are well established and accomplished figures, but some of their exchanges this season have been a little undignified. Horner called his rival a “control freak”, leading the Austrian to venture that the Englishman was a “windbag who always wants to be on camera”. “The more Toto gets wound up, the more fun it becomes,” Horner fired back, an idea Wolff assessed as “worrying”. “Sometimes I was carried away when I heard comments that annoyed me,” Wolff admitted last week. These outbursts have set the tone for an increasingly acrimonious contest. Verstappen said on Thursday his view of Hamilton had changed, and “not in a positive way”. It is clear Wolff and Horner now share that feeling about each other. “I have no issue with Toto,” Horner told Donald McRae in October – nothing personal, it appeared. By the time the teams arrived in the Middle East for this weekend’s high-stakes decider in Abu Dhabi, that neutrality had evaporated. “We’re both competitive,” Horner said on Friday. “I have respect for Mercedes, I have respect for Toto, but it doesn’t mean I have to like him.” Both men have instinctively backed their drivers on racing incidents that remain open to interpretation. As the season has unfolded there have been flashes of anger and claims of injustice from either side. If there was a single moment when the mood darkened it was the accident at Silverstone in July when Verstappen slammed into the barriers at Copse. The Dutchman was taken to hospital while Hamilton streaked away to victory. Horner insisted Hamilton’s 10-second penalty for that incident, when he clipped Verstappen’s rear left tyre heading into that flat-out corner, was insufficient. His sense of outrage was manifold: accusing Hamilton of “dirty driving”, he complained of Verstappen’s life being placed in danger, along with the team losing a badly damaged engine and car. “I don’t think I have to apologise for anything,” Hamilton countered, while Wolff, before the next race in Hungary, said Horner had been “below the belt” in his criticism of Hamilton. The tension – and danger – was ratcheted up further when Verstappen and Hamilton crashed again at Monza in September, the shaken seven-times champion saying the halo on his cockpit had saved his life after the Red Bull bounced on top of the Mercedes in a chicane. “We don’t want a situation where … someone gets really hurt,” Wolff said. The heat has risen steadily and Horner suggested Wolff was experiencing a new kind of pressure. “He came into the sport with Mercedes in 2013 and the structure was already in place,” Horner told McRae. “He’s never experienced anything other than winning. So it’s a different type of pressure now. It’s tough.” Will Horner regret those words given the ruthlessness with which Hamilton – and Wolff – have roared back? During Friday’s media duties Horner produced the necessary lines about the season’s “amazing journey” and the excitement of a winner-takes-all race. But compared with Wolff, he looked tired and flat, no doubt privately annoyed at seeing Verstappen’s lead reduced to nothing. Wolff, meanwhile, looked genuinely relaxed, insisting he had not expected to be in contention for the drivers’ title after Verstappen won in Mexico. “Marvellous,” was how he described forcing a winner-takes-all decider. “We have only to gain.” Wolff aimed to defuse tension – and perhaps take the sting out of questions – by shaking hands with Horner. “Good luck. May the best man and the best team win,” he smiled from behind his facemask, leaving little doubt as to who he thought was the best team. “It’s been intense between the two of us,” Horner said. “It’ll be intense next year, and the year after,” adding he was not planning to invite Wolff on holiday. Wolff pondered the idea briefly before coldly replying: “I don’t know if it would be so much fun.” The pre-race mood appears civil, yet guarded. It remains to be seen whether Wolff and Horner will be shaking each other by the hand or by the throat in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.",Sport/Sport,Wolff and Horner’s rivalry is just as fierce as Hamilton v Verstappen | Luke McLaughlin,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/11/formula-one-wolff-horner-mercedes-red-bull-rivalry
12/11/2021,"The Treasury has been forced to defend officials holding an “impromptu” drinks party to celebrate Rishi Sunak’s autumn spending review during lockdown, it has emerged. A spokesperson insisted it was a “small number” of staff who celebrated around their desks, despite reports put the number closer to two dozen civil servants at the event.  A team of officials working on the chancellor’s spending review announcement stayed after hours for the party on 25 November 2020, the Times reported. Government sources said the drinks were not planned but the civil servants involved bought beer and wine from a nearby supermarket. A Treasury spokesperson told the Guardian: “A number of HMT staff came into the office to work on the spending review 2020. We have been made aware that a small number of staff had impromptu drinks around their desks after the event. “The Treasury did not organise an in-person departmental party last Christmas.” It is understood that Sunak was not at the event and was not aware of it taking place at the time. During the November lockdown non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues were closed as well as pubs, bars and restaurants. People were told to stay at home except for limited reasons including work if it could not be done from home. The latest controversy comes as Downing Street and prime minister Boris Johnson face criticism over allegations of Covid rule-breaking parties held in the run-up to last Christmas. The prime minister’s now director of communications Jack Doyle is reported to have addressed staff and handed out awards at a No 10 Christmas party last year that is currently under investigation. Doyle, who was then deputy director of communications at Downing Street, is believed to have addressed up to 50 people and presented awards to the press office at the gathering on 18 December 2020. The prime minister has announced an internal investigation led by the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, would look into reports of the event. The investigation was later widened to include another festive celebration and a reported staff leaving do. Downing Street said it has cancelled plans to hold a Christmas party this year. Mr Johnson’s former aide Dominic Cummings tweeted on Friday that there are “lots” of photos of parties in No 10 that will “inevitably get out”. Reports of government officials allegedly breaking lockdown restrictions while the rest of the country could not see friends and family last Christmas has seen Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour move ahead in opinion polls.",News/Politics,Treasury defends ‘impromptu’ drinks party after Sunak’s autumn budget,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/11/treasury-defends-impromptu-drinks-party-after-rishi-sunak-autumn-budget
12/11/2021,"Don’t be fooled by the supreme court’s nominal hedging on its endorsement of SB8, the Texas abortion ban that deputizes private citizens to sue anyone who assists in an abortion after six weeks’ gestation. In a ruling on Friday, the court held that a lawsuit by Texas abortion providers could go forward – but only on narrow grounds. Only those state officials responsible for licensing medical providers may be sued, the court ordered – no one else involved in the state’s practical maintenance of SB8 is liable. The ruling said, for instance, that the providers could not sue court clerks, those bureaucrats tasked with actually docketing the lawsuits that would enforce SB8. For providers, it seems that the best possible outcome for the suit now is that they may be able to secure an injunction preventing medical providers from being delicensed. These perplexing limits placed by the court on which parties can be sued to challenge SB8 ensures that though the suit against the law will be at least partly allowed to go forward, it will be largely toothless.  In the meantime, SB8 will remain law. Women in Texas are effectively banned from securing a legal abortion in the state, even though the still-standing Roe v Wade decision says that they have a right to one. It’s likely that SB8 will remain in effect at least for the duration of Roe’s lifetime – meaning that Texas women will not be able to obtain legal abortions after six weeks for the foreseeable future. Many of the initial media responses to the court’s opinion emphasized that since the suit was allowed to go forward, on technical grounds, the ruling was a narrow win for the abortion providers. But in reality Friday was a massive win for the rightwing Texas government, and for anti-choice forces nationwide. That SB8 has been allowed to take effect – now for the second time – by the supreme court reflects the justices’ eagerness to gut abortion rights. The fact of the matter is that the court is already set to overturn Roe and allow states to ban abortion outright. That much was clear to anyone who listened to last week’s oral arguments in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health, a case surrounding the constitutionality of a 15-week ban in Mississippi, which devolved into grim misogynist spectacle as the Republican appointees held court on the supposed ease of giving infants up for adoption and their own robust comfort with overturning long-settled precedent. That ruling is scheduled to come down in late May or early June. When it does, a slim majority of states are expected to ban abortion, either immediately or very soon thereafter. That means that soon SB8 – and the copycat bills that it has inspired in states like Florida and Arkansas – won’t be necessary for the anti-choice lobby to achieve their aims. Instead of concocting an elaborate enforcement process in which rogue anti-woman vigilantes enforce their abortion bans, the states will be able to enforce their bans themselves. SB8, then, and the supreme court’s embrace of it, can be understood not only as a harbinger of the justices’ deep contempt for the abortion right, but also of their childish impatience to exert this contempt upon American women. They can’t even wait six months. They want to ban abortion right now. In pursuit of this goal, the supreme court has proven itself willing to undermine its own capacity to oversee state laws, to enforce federal supremacy, and to protect constitutional rights. The anti-choice substance of the court’s decision in SB8 was not surprising; its embrace of Texas’s tactics perhaps was. Aside from its direct attempt to undermine women’s rights, SB8 also took aim at judicial authority. By banning abortion long before viability, the law flouted the supreme court’s precedents in Roe and Planned Parenthood v Casey. But that much a slew of vehemently anti-choice justices would probably forgive: all six of the Republican appointees clearly believe that Roe was wrongly decided, and at least five of them (all but Roberts, who seems more trepidatious) appear eager to overturn it. But in its novel enforcement mechanism, SB8 sought specifically to evade judicial review – not just to give the court an opportunity to overturn its own precedent, but to make it so that within Texas borders supreme court precedent didn’t matter. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor compared SB8 to the views of John C Calhoun – a nineteenth-century pro-slavery campaigner who argued that states have the right to nullify federal laws that they do not like. America fought its civil war in no small part over this question. By first allowing the SB8 to go into effect, in September, and then by gutting the lawsuit against it this Friday, the supreme court has, shockingly, endorsed a scheme to undermine its own power, and granted a state the ability to evade federal precedent. Nullification, it seems, is back in style. For years, court watchers have wondered whether the justices’ institutionalist instincts would overcome their misogynist ones: if the Court had to choose between maintaining its own power and legitimacy, and overturning Roe, which would it choose? Now, it seems, we have our answer.
