3/4/2022,"The federal Liberal division has staged a limited intervention in the affairs of its troubled NSW division to install candidates in just three seats held by sitting members. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, and the former federal Liberal president, Chris McDiven, have been appointed to a committee that has a limited remit to take over the party for 72 hours and deal with the preselections for the three sitting members. They are the environment minister, Sussan Ley, in Farrer, the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, in Mitchell and the MP for North Sydney, Trent Zimmerman, a key figure in the moderate faction. All three had faced uncertain futures if branch votes were held to determine the candidates. The remaining seats where preselections are yet to be held are being left for the NSW division to determine with the May federal election looming. There now appears to be a willingness to hold truncated preselections in seats where more than one candidate has nominated before 25 March – the deadline set by the federal executive. Friday’s compromise gives Morrison the result he wanted – it saves his ministers – but leaves most of the contentious preselections for the NSW division to sort out. These include Hughes, Dobell, Parramatta, Greenway and, probably, Eden Monaro. Only one person, Lincoln Parker, has nominated as a candidate in Warringah currently held by independent Zali Steggall. Sources said the federal executive was reluctant to adopt a plan put on Thursday night – apparently by the prime minister’s office – for the federal executive to dissolve the Liberal party’s largest branch and appoint McDiven as an administrator for two weeks in order to administratively appoint all remaining candidates. That course of action would almost certainly have led to more legal action in the NSW supreme court. A plan by the right to parachute former Young Liberal president and nephew of the editor-in-chief of the Australian, Alex Dore, into the seat of Hughes was causing the most angst. But there was also great discontent in Warringah where factional heavyweights had proposed to overlook the only nominated candidate, Parker, and instead appoint disabilities campaigner David Brady who is a nominee for Senate. Those proposals now face an uncertain future. “I guess it’s a win for the moderates because Trent is now able to get out and campaign in North Sydney and we are a bit worried about that seat,” said one moderate who was not authorised to speak openly. “The right have also lost some of their leverage because they had the numbers in Farrer and maybe in Mitchell.” The compromise forestalls any legal challenges which could have been launched by disaffected rank and file members furious that the party had tried to avoid new rules aimed at introducing more democracy into the party through branch member plebiscites. The far more limited intervention by the federal executive is an acknowledgment of the likely dispiriting effect on depriving the rank and file of their say. However, the NSW state executive still needs to pass motions aimed at shortening the timetables and introducing televised town halls to preselect the remaining federal candidates. These require 90% support by the 25-member executive which has so far proven difficult to achieve. Some expressed concern that the federal executive’s decision just “kicked the can down the road”. The NSW president, Philip Ruddock, said he was now working towards achieving the preselection process by the 25 March deadline set by the federal executive.",News/Australia news,Federal intervention in NSW Liberal party secures future of Coalition ministers and sitting MP ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/federal-intervention-in-nsw-liberal-party-secures-future-of-coalition-ministers-and-sitting-mp
3/4/2022,"California governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a court program that would force unhoused people with severe mental illnesses and addiction disorders into treatment. The moves comes in response to a worsening humanitarian crisis of people living on the streets, but has raised concerns from disability rights and civil liberties advocates. The plan would create a “Care Court” requiring people with serious mental health challenges, such as schizophrenia, to accept treatment while also mandating that counties provide services, Newsom said Thursday when announcing the program. If people don’t follow through with forced treatment, they could be placed into conservatorships, a form of court-appointed guardianship that strips people of their rights to make basic decisions about their lives and care. The homelessness crisis has become the top issue in political races across the state, as there are growing encampments and more visible signs of people struggling with mental illness on the streets. Some officials have responded with sweeps of tent communities and new policies prohibiting camping in certain locations individuals from sleeping outside. The announcement also follows intense scrutiny of California’s conservatorship system surrounding the case of pop star Britney Spears, who spent nearly 14 years under a court-appointed guardianship that she said was abusive and controlling. Depending on legislation – the court program would create a mental health branch in counties’ civil courtrooms and counties could face sanctions if they don’t provide services. California Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary Mark Ghaly called it a new “framework” to respond to “one of the most heartbreaking, heart-wrenching and yet curable challenges that we face in our communities and on our streets”. Ghaly estimated that 7,000 to 12,000 people in California could be eligible. People who are arrested or facing charges could be diverted from the criminal justice system into the Care Court, officials said. Relatives, first responders and others could also refer people to the program, which would not just be for the unhoused. “The really important part of the Care Court model is that the court has responsibility not just to oversee and ensure that the individual is participating in the treatment plan, but that government partners, counties and others, are prioritizing this population.” As of January 2020, more than 150,000 people are considered to be homeless in California. Officials have not unveiled details about the timeline or funding. But the announcement quickly raised alarms among advocates for the unhoused and people with disabilities, who have long opposed involuntary care. Some argue it is ineffective and can violate people’s constitutional rights. Others said it is counterproductive to use the courts as the response to the homelessness crisis. “Subjecting unhoused people to forced treatment is extremely draconian, and it would take us back to the bad old days of confinement, coercive treatment and other deprivations of rights targeting people with disabilities,” said Eve Garrow, policy analyst and advocate at the ACLU of Southern California. “It’s morally wrong.” The problem, Garrow said, was that existing voluntary programs were not adequately accessible or effective for “people living on the streets where they have to endure extreme deprivation, exposure to violence and the daily trauma of law enforcement harassment, all of which contribute to and exacerbate mental health disabilities”. Conservatorships are meant for elderly people and those with grave disabilities who the courts deem unable to take care of themselves, but the Spears case shone a light on how guardianships can erode individuals’ most basic rights – and how hard it can be to terminate the arrangements. Jasmine E Harris, a University of Pennsylvania law professor and disability rights expert, said Newsom’s announcement mirrored trends across the country, including a growing movement of families who have pushed for involuntary treatment in response to the opioid crisis. But studies have suggested that coercive treatment is often ineffective and that housing and other services are the most appropriate response to unhoused people in crisis, Harris said. She also noted that federal disability rights regulations dictate that services should be delivered in the “least restrictive environment” possible.“Community-based services and treatment, when they are meaningful, will almost always be superior to a restrictive setting where the individual loses all agency,” Harris said. “If you expand the authority for individuals to be hauled into court or to be stripped of their rights, it’s a really slippery slope.” Garrow noted a 2011 study on involuntary treatment and homelessness, which found that forced care had no significant difference in outcomes compared to standard care. A 2014 psychiatric epidemiology review also concluded that empirical evidence did not support coercive treatment. Asked whether the Care Court program would expand the use of conservatorships for unhoused people, HHS spokesperson Sami Gallegos said in an email that the program would seek to “divert individuals in need away from the pathway to conservatorships” by focusing on “community-based placements with robust services, including housing”. Individuals would be referred to conservatorships if the court process fails and “if no suitable alternatives to conservatorship are available”. Harris said the lack of investment in community-based alternatives often created a Catch 22: “Even if you say conservatorship is ‘the nuclear option’, if you don’t have any other options available, the nuclear option becomes the only option.” Newsom told the San Francisco Chronicle that there was no more time to debate people’s civil rights when communities were faced with “people with their clothes off defecating and urinating in the middle of the streets, screaming and talking to themselves”. “I’m increasingly outraged by what’s going on in the streets,” he said. “I’m disgusted with it.” While there are growing concerns about escalating gun violence and homicide rates, advocates argue that the unhoused are themselves victimized at disproportionately high rates. Ananya Roy, director of the UCLA Luskin Institute on Inequality and Democracy, said the court proposal was concerning and was part of a trend in California of criminalizing the unhoused. “There is seemingly a lot of compassion for the unhoused,” Roy said, “but that is coupled with a deliberate and enforced state of stripping the unhoused of rights in the name of saving them and doing good.”",News/US news,California proposal would force unhoused people into treatment,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/03/california-proposal-forced-unhoused-treatment
3/4/2022,"Labour have won the byelection in Birmingham Erdington. Paulette Hamilton will become the city’s first black MP, beating the Conservative candidate Robert Alden. The byelection was triggered by the sudden death in January of the Labour MP Jack Dromey, who had held the seat since 2010. Labour were the favourites to win, having held the constituency since it was created in 1974, but the Conservatives increased their vote share in recent years and there were jitters a low turnout could produce a surprise result. Turnout was an expectedly low 27%, with a total of 17,016 ballots cast, fewer than the 17,720 votes Dromey alone received in 2019. Dromey, who was married to the former Labour cabinet minister Harriet Harman, held the seat with a majority of 3,601 in 2019 when the Conservatives made significant gains in the region, including taking the former Labour stronghold Birmingham Northfield. Hamilton, a 59-year-old former nurse and mother-of-five, is the cabinet member for health and social care on Labour-controlled Birmingham city council and has lived in the seat for 35 years. After a smooth running campaign, on the eve of the vote comments made by Hamilton in 2015 at an event called “The Ballot or the Bullet – Does your vote count?” emerged, in which she said: “I’m not sure we will get what we really deserve in this country using the vote. “But I don’t know if we are a strong enough group to get what we want to get if we have an uprising … I am very torn.” Labour said the comments were “misrepresented and taken out of context as part of a deliberate attempt by the Conservatives and their allies to hijack a democratic election … These attacks on a black woman seeking to become the city’s first black MP are deeply disturbing.” Alden has fought the seat for the past four general elections, and is leader of the Tory group on the city council.",News/UK news,Birmingham Erdington byelection winner is Labour’s Paulette Hamilton,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/04/birmingham-erdington-byelection-winner-is-labours-paulette-hamilton
