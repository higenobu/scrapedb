12/13/2021,"Source: Courtesy of @ebereillustrate / @ebereillustrate A medical student and illustrator from Nigeria sparked a wide conversation about the lack of diversity in medical industry textbooks from an eye-catching illustration posted to his social media account. 25-year-old Chidiebere Ibe, a first-time student at Kyiv Medical University, drew an image of a pregnant Black woman’s womb– a diagram that is rarely seen in the medical industry. Ibe’s stunning illustration quickly went viral with many people noting how most, if not all medical diagrams, appear to depict white women. Ibe’s drawing has since sparked an outpour of support from social media users and has amassed over 95,000 likes on Instagram– something the young medical student said he “never expected.” “The whole purpose was to keep talking about what I’m passionate about –– equity in healthcare — and also to show the beauty of Black people,” Ibe told the HuffPost UK. “We don’t only need more representation like this — we need more people willing to create representation like this.” Black social media users have been pouring into the medical illustrator’s comment section expressing their gratitude for the inclusive image. One Instagram user commented: “I’ve literally never seen anything like this! Keep doing what you’re doing! You should make a textbook! Too much? A reference book! A pamphlet! Whatever it is, this should be produced. I’m nowhere near the medical field, but I’m an educator who loves information soooo…I’d buy it!” Another social media goer chimed in; “This is amazingly beautiful! Thank you for sharing! As a Wombman and a Holistic Doula, I would love to share your illustration with all of my clients! Do you offer prints for sale?” While supermodel Noami Campbell simply wrote: “Thank You”. The passionate illustrator, who hails from Ebonyi State, Nigeria, taught himself how to draw during the Coronavirus lockdown period. Artnet News reported that Ibe is currently the chief medical illustrator and creative director at the Journal of Global Neurosurgery. He dreams of becoming a pediatric neurosurgeon someday and hopes that his illustrations can be used to save lives. “Textbooks are essential to medical training,” Ibe wrote on his YouTube channel. They walk medical trainees through conditions they will encounter during their practice. The skin is an important organ that protects us and can signal when something is wrong in our body. Yet, most medical illustrations are on the Caucasian skin. This lack of diversity has important implications for medical trainees and their future patients because many conditions and signs look different based on the patient’s skin color.” RELATED CONTENT: National Birth Equity Collaborative Pens Open Letter To Vice President Kamala Harris Ibe also told Artnet News that the lack of diversity in the medical illustration world could potentially lead to a misdiagnosis or insufficient treatment plan for Black people. Ibe noted that “the lack of understanding of how diseases can appear for Black patients can lead to “mortality, childbirth pains,” and “communication problems.” According to the Association of Medical Illustrators, there are 2,000 trained medical illustrators in the world, many of whom are white and male. A study conducted by the University of Wollongong in Australia found that out of more than 6000 medical images found across 17 anatomy textbooks published between 2008 and 2013, only 36 percent of the bodies depicted were female– a majority being White. 3 percent of the drawings depicted disabled bodies and only 2 percent captured elderly people.    A post shared by Chidiebere Ibe (@ebereillustrate) “Historically [medical illustrations] have always featured white able-bodied male figures and still do in the present day,” Ni-Ka Ford, diversity committee chair for the Association of Medical Illustrators told CNN. “Bias towards one body type in medical illustration marginalizes everyone else.” Ibe has created a GoFundMe to help with his education fees and to hopefully bring more awareness to the lack of diversity and equity within the health care industry.

12/13/2021,"The largest and most devastating of the four tornadoes that ripped into Kentucky overnight Saturday tore through hundreds of miles and multiple states. The storm originated in Arkansas, according to Kentucky Division of Emergency Management director Michael Dossett, and touched down in Missouri and Tennessee before making its way into the Bluegrass State, where it ripped through the western half of the state before finally weakening in central Kentucky. At least 70 people were likely killed, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said, and that number could climb higher to 100 or more casualties. Live updates from Kentucky: Get the latest news on tornado damage in the state here In Kentucky, it struck Mayfield directly before moving northeast through Benton, Princeton and Beaver Dam before weakening in Breckinridge County. Its path stretched more than 220 miles, Beshear said at a 5 a.m. press conference covering the devastation. Mayfield was hit hard. More than 100 people were working at a candle manufacturing plant during the storm, Beshear said, and a roof collapse at the facility resulted in ""mass casualties."" Bowling Green, the home of Western Kentucky University, also saw extensive damage — the school canceled commencement ceremonies scheduled for Saturday in the aftermath of the storm. Three other tornadoes were reported in Kentucky overnight, though those storms are believed to have been smaller than the one that hit Mayfield. All four tornadoes touched down in Western Kentucky. Even counties that weren't hit by tornadoes were impacted by storms. More than 12,300 Louisville Gas & Electric customers were without power as of 8:30 p.m., according to LG&E's power map. For the category of the biggest tornado, the National Weather Service office in Paducah tweeted Saturday it would likely ""take some time to make a determination on intensity / rating."" But the weather service said damage appeared to be consistent with an F3 tornado capable of producing winds as strong as 206 mph. The Paducah office also said an aerial assessment of damage appeared to show an ""historic long track tornado"" that was at least three-quarters of a mile wide in Kentucky as it went from southwest of Cayce in Fulton County to at least Beaver Dam in Ohio County. The storm traveled over 220 miles from Arkansas into Kentucky. Mayfield is south of Paducah, a town in Western Kentucky with an estimated population of about 25,000 people. Mayfield, with a population of about 10,000, is in Graves County, which borders Tennessee. ""This has been one of the toughest nights in Kentucky history, and some areas have been hit in ways that are hard to put into words,"" Beshear said.
