2/24/2022,"Restoring parliament without a full decant of MPs could take up to 76 years, while the bill for repairs would stretch to £22bn, a new report by the body set up to investigate how the project should be handled has found. MPs, peers and senior parliamentary officials are still split on the best way to proceed with extensive works to the Victorian building given safety concerns about crumbling masonry, the lack of protection against flooding and decades-old electrical wiring.  Under the most recent plan, MPs were expected to move to Richmond House, the former home of the Department of Health, while the Palace of Westminster – with a floor plate the size of 16 football pitches and containing 1,100 rooms, 100 staircases and 3 miles of passageways – is being restored. However, the idea was abandoned last year. Alternatives were drawn up and presented to the House of Commons Commission, which were released on Wednesday. The cheapest plan involved a full decant of the Palace of Westminster, for between 12 and 20 years, with the work costing in the region of £7bn to £13bn. With MPs elsewhere for much of the time, the report estimated the works would take between 19 and 28 years. If MPs maintained a “continued presence” in the palace, where “all essential and highly desirable functions could be accommodated but in more condensed space”, the report found that the work would cost more and take longer. In one scenario, business would remain within the Commons chamber “until such a point is reached whereby all operations are transferred to another space within the Palace of Westminster (assumed to be the House of Lords chamber), to allow the rest of the work to proceed”. It estimated this would increase restoration costs to between £9.5bn and £18.5bn, taking 26 to 43 years. And in a third possible scenario, which would cost the most and take the longest, business would remain within the chamber “throughout the entirety of the restoration and renewal programme of works” with “no transfer”. It is estimated this would cost between £11bn and £22bn and take in the region of 46 to 76 years. This was conditional on recess being extended to scrap the three-week return for MPs between their summer and party conference breaks, so that there was no parliamentary business for four months, from mid-July to mid-October. The figures do not take into account inflation, meaning the true cost over several decades would likely be billions more expensive, given compound interest. The report was not well received by the Commons Commission, and led to it voting last month to bring the sponsor body for the works in-house. One of the plans being considered by senior Commons officials is to use boats to deliver materials and remove detritus via the River Thames. This would help minimise disruption around Westminster, but also make it harder for MPs, peers and their staff to operate as normal on the current site. Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the union Prospect, said a full decant was “the only credible plan”, and would be cheaper, quicker and safer. He added: “We cannot allow the faux emotional attachments of some to get in the way of the restoration off the house being achieved safely, expeditiously and in a way that recognises the concerns of staff and achieves value for money for the taxpayer. “I am sure that will be fully supported by the new minister for civil service efficiency. To come to any other conclusion would be perverse.”",News/Politics,"Parliament renovation could take 76 years and cost £22bn, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/23/parliament-renovation-could-take-76-years-and-cost-22bn-report-says
2/24/2022,"The EU has approved asset freezes and travel bans on various Russian people and entities in response to Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognise the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. The list of those targeted has not been officially confirmed, but here are five of the most prominent names the Guardian has seen on a draft list.  Russia’s minister of defence has overseen the military buildup on Ukraine’s borders and would manage the war effort if Russia chooses to launch a wider invasion. He is a rare member of Putin’s inner circle who did not serve in KGB, military or intelligence circles. He served as minister for emergency situations from 1991 to 2012, before being appointed defence minister by Putin with the task of modernising the Russian military. Alongside Putin’s senior aides, Shoigu has been involved in key decisions, such as the annexation of Crimea, because of his oversight of the military and the aggressive GRU intelligence agency. He also has direct access to Putin, including during their regular hunting and fishing trips together in Siberia. Shoigu is from Tuva, a Buddhist republic in Siberia that borders Mongolia. The St Petersburg-based businessman has been dubbed “Putin’s chef” because of the restaurants and catering businesses where he made his fortune in the 1990s. Since then his business interests have expanded into government contracts and other endeavours, allegedly including a troll factory, a private military company, and global influence operations that have landed him on numerous sanctions lists. According to the US Treasury Department, Prigozhin is the Russian financier of the Internet Research Agency, a network of websites and paid trolls that allegedly tried to influence the 2016 US presidential election in favour of Donald Trump. Prigozhin is “also believed to be the financier behind [the] private military company Wagner, a designated Russian Ministry of Defence proxy force,” the Treasury department said. The company’s alleged activities in Ukraine, Syria, Sudan and Libya have “generated insecurity and incited violence against innocent civilians”, the Treasury Department said. Igor Shuvalov is a Russian politician and businessman who is being sanctioned as the head of Vnesheconombank (VEB), the Russian financial institution that is a key source of funding for the Kremlin’s priority projects. Those have included the Sochi Olympics, among others. Shuvalov was previously a first deputy prime minister in both Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin’s cabinets before he left government and was appointed chairman of VEB in 2018. He was previously one of the most senior liberal figures in government until they were largely ousted in favour of Putin’s security hawks as his dominant advisers. Shuvalov, who was seen as a close Putin ally nearly a decade ago, has owned property in London and was targeted for his wealth by the jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who demanded a police investigation. As tensions over Ukraine reached fever pitch last week, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova issued a “request to the mass disinformation outlets of the USA and Britain – Bloomberg, the New York Times, the Sun etc – announce the schedule of our ‘invasions’ for the coming year. I’d like to plan my vacation.” It was a typically mocking response from the chief spokesperson of Russia’s diplomatic service. Zakharova is a career diplomat but isn’t very diplomatic. She has described a previous US ambassador as “incompetent”, said D-Day’s significance should not be exaggerated on the 75th anniversary of the landings, and joked about sending a journalist asking about human rights abuses in Chechyna to the region. A graduate of the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations, who speaks English and Chinese, she is feted in Russian state media for her combative style, evident in her torrent of Facebook posts attacking western governments. The EU has called her “a central figure of government propaganda”. ​​Margarita Simonyan was just 25 when she was chosen to be the first editor of Russia Today, the state channel broadcasting in English and other languages, later described by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, as an agency of “lying propaganda”. Now known simply as RT, it has offered its small number of viewers in the UK guests from Jeremy Corbyn to Nigel Farage, conspiracy theories and baseless claims about “genocide” in Ukraine. Simonyan, now editor-in-chief of the RT network, is said to have a direct line to the Kremlin on her desk and was given an award by Putin for “objectivity” after the annexation of Crimea. She greeted reports of her imminent addition to sanctions lists with mockery. “Maria Zakharova and I took out our handkerchiefs,” she said, adding it was time to have “a little cry”.",News/World news,From ‘Putin’s chef’ to the RT editor: names expected to appear on EU sanctions list,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/from-putins-chef-to-the-rt-editor-names-expected-to-appear-on-eu-sanctions-list
2/24/2022,"The Rugby Football Union is banking on supporters to self-police and stay away from Twickenham on Saturday if they have a confirmed case of Covid-19, or any symptoms, with no plans to check vaccine passes with restrictions in England to be lifted on Thursday.  The match on Saturday will be the first major international sporting event in England since restrictions were lifted with more than 80,000 supporters due at Twickenham. It will also be the first Six Nations match at Twickenham at full capacity since the same fixture two years ago, which took place just days before the UK was plunged into its first lockdown and with England’s subsequent trip to Italy already postponed. Any fears around the fixture on Saturday will be heightened by the fact that England’s victory against South Africa in November – the last Test to take place at Twickenham – was initially highlighted as a possible epicentre for the UK’s Omicron outbreak and subsequent rise in cases. During the autumn, the RFU conducted spot-checks for Covid vaccine passes – which all spectators were required to have – but from Thursday, the government has decreed that anyone with a confirmed case of Covid-19 in England is no longer legally required to self-isolate. The government continues to advise that anyone with a positive case stays at home but in the absence of a legal requirement, that advice could effectively be ignored. An RFU spokesperson said: “With the lifting of government restrictions, we will not be carrying out mandatory NHS covid pass checks. However, we expect anyone with a confirmed case of covid or with covid symptoms to protect others and not attend the game.” The RFU’s guidance for supporters also includes wearing a cloth face covering at all times as well as following good hygiene practices at all times in line with the latest government and public health guidance. Supporters with symptoms, or a positive covid case, will be able to sell their tickets via the RFU’s exchange programme until 5pm on Friday. Meanwhile, the England squad will still be subject to existing Covid protocols for the remainder of the competition despite the lifting of restrictions. During the championship the Six Nations organisers are responsible for introducing uniform protocols and given different competing countries have different levels of restrictions it is not seen as viable to relax the measures imposed on Eddie Jones’s squad.",Sport/Sport,"Stay away from Twickenham if you have Covid symptoms, pleads RFU",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/23/stay-away-from-twickenham-if-you-have-covid-symptoms-pleads-rfu
2/24/2022,"Boris Johnson has told ministers he is determined to give his full version of the Downing Street parties scandal in public, including his belief that there is a co-ordinated campaign to oust him. The prime minister has told cabinet allies he believes the police will clear him of any legal wrongdoing, the Guardian has been told. He is said to be frustrated that he is constrained by the criminal investigation and intends to set the record straight when it finishes.  The prime minister has repeatedly told journalists in interviews he will have “something meaningful to say about this” when the Met investigation ends. It comes as Whitehall sources said multiple staffers had filled in Metropolitan police questionnaires stating only “no comment” in answer to questions posed as part of Operation Hillman, the inquiry into a dozen alleged events in breach of lockdown rules. There is growing nervousness among Downing Street staff that they will be handed fines while Johnson escapes without a fixed penalty notice (FPN). Some privately confessed to having little faith in the police investigation and said colleagues were likely to simply write “no comment” on the Metropolitan police questionnaire to avoid admitting guilt. Not all can afford expensive private legal advice as Johnson is expected to have received and are instead relying on pro bono help. The prime minister returned his Met questionnaire last week – one of more than 80 questionnaires reportedly set to staff members and aides. The Met has confirmed the number is more than 50. Johnson received external legal advice before submitting the questionnaire, a blank version of which was leaked on Tuesday. It revealed questions were asked under police caution, making Johnson the first prime minister to have been questioned under caution. A fresh batch of questionnaires were issued by Scotland Yard this week, suggesting Operation Hillman could continue into March. Whitehall insiders said they fear the Met investigation’s conclusions could come close to the May local elections, potentially in the “purdah” period. They warned this may further prolong the period before Sue Gray’s report into the parties was published in full. As well as asking the recipient to confirm their attendance at a specific event, the leaked questionnaire shows receipients were asked: “What was the purpose of your participation in that gathering?” and “Did you interact with, or undertake any activity with, other persons present at the gathering? If yes, please provide details.” Recipients were offered the opportunity to give a “lawful exception” or “reasonable excuse” for attending. The Met investigation into 12 social events, several of them attended by the prime minister, was triggered by evidence uncovered by the senior civil servant Sue Gray. Johnson’s allies are convinced he has a justification for attending events that took place at No 10, which is his home as well as his workplace. He initially denied reports that parties had been held in Downing Street, telling MPs: “All guidance was followed completely.” Many MPs and ministers have privately expressed the view that Johnson would likely to face – and potentially lose – a vote of no confidence if he were to receive a fixed penalty notice for breaching the rules. But with the prime minister’s fate currently in limbo, one cabinet minister said on Tuesday that they believed enough doubt had been sowed among MPs to ensure the prime minister’s position was safe, particularly given the conflict in Ukraine. The minister said they believed there were now no more than 30 letters of no confidence submitted to the chair of the 1922 committee, Graham Brady, with 54 needed to trigger a vote of MPs. A leading MP critical of Johnson said they believed rebels had lost their moment. “We have been poorly organised in the last few weeks, there’s no question,” they said. The MP, who has submitted a letter of no confidence, said they remained confident that at least 54 MPs would submit letters should Johnson be fined. “But Downing Street’s operation has succeeded in moving the goalposts,” they said. “Now colleagues are only prepared to move if there is a criminal offence. A month ago, it was if Sue Gray’s report was sufficiently damning. Now even some of my most critical colleagues are prepared to say in the WhatsApp group that it’s no longer an issue of concern for constituents.”",News/Politics,Johnson tells ministers he wants to give his side of story over parties ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/23/johnson-parties-met-investigation
2/24/2022,"The new chief executive of Barclays, CS Venkatakrishnan, will know what shareholders want from him: decent profits and fewer run-ins with regulators. Predecessor, Jes Staley, made progress on the former front but failed on the latter: he somehow survived a hefty fine for trying to unmask a whistleblower but was felled by the continuing regulatory probe into his characterisation of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Wednesday’s full-year report represented a promising inheritance for Venkatakrishnan. Pre-tax profits for 2021 hit a record £8.4bn and demonstrated that, for big banks at least, the pandemic is over. A total of £653m of credit impairments were written back. Meanwhile, return on tangible equity – a better measure of a bank’s financial performance – was 13.4%, the best in years, and every division achieved the desired double digits. Capital ratios were comfortably above target. At 6p, the dividend is almost back to pre-Covid levels and there was a spare £1bn to spray at buying back shares.  On the requirement to avoid excitement, Venkatakrishnan sounds the part. He ducked for cover when invited to comment on Staley’s £22m-worth of frozen share awards and he signalled zero change of strategic direction – hardly surprising since he helped design the original plan. So plain sailing? Well, no. The stock market clearly still worries that Barclays will find new ways to disappoint, which is not an unreasonable view on past evidence. The deficit in the credibility ledger is a share price that, even after Wednesday’s 3% gain, stands well below book value; 196p plays 292p. Even NatWest, half-owned by the state, has a narrower discount these days. Put another way, Barclays’ “transatlantic” model of combining plain-vanilla UK retail and business lending with high-thrills Wall Street investment banking is still not universally trusted. Purely domestic banks just look more predictable. Staley, to be fair, made a better case for diversity in earnings and geography than his own predecessor-but-one, Bob Diamond, ever did. But Venkatakrishnan is the chief executive who will have to seal the deal. Interest rates are rising, which is a helpful backdrop for lenders, and Barclays’ investment bank has been redesigned to make it less of a naked bet on bond-trading volumes. The definition of a par score for Venkatakrishnan would be several years in a row of double-digit returns on equity. Easier said than done, but he has the chance to be the boring boss Barclays has been seeking for two decades. Lawrence Stroll’s fan club should have listened harder when he said his intended “transformation” of Aston Martin Lagonda would take four to five years to perform. High hopes drove the shares as high as £21 soon after the rescue of the luxury carmaker in late-2020, but the price is now back roughly where it started at £10. There were few unexpected horrors within the £76.5m of operating losses for 2021, or £214m at the pre-tax level, but the gap between the two figures points to the major worry. Aston Martin, even in refinanced form, is still leaking substantial sums in interest payments on its borrowings. Net debt was £892m at the end of December and, worst of all, the company is still suffering the pauper’s interest rates agreed by old management in the dark days when corporate survival was in doubt. The aim is to achieve positive cashflow in 2023, which is probably the earliest that borrowing terms could be negotiated. The £2.5m-a-pop Valkyrie “hypercar” is built for speed; the corporate self-help programme wasn’t. As we inspect those long lists of Russian companies on the UK stock market and wonder how they all got here, here’s a tale from the archives that helps to explain. Back in 2006, there was a serious debate in Westminster as to whether Gazprom, Russia’s state-controlled energy giant, should be allowed to buy Centrica, owner of British Gas and a company that, as now, owns a significant stake in the UK’s fleet of nuclear power stations. Gazprom kicked things off in February of that year when one of its senior executives said a bid was being “analysed and investigated”. Centrica’s shares shot up 25% in a day. Even come April, the story had legs. The FT reported that “Tony Blair [prime minister at the time] has ruled out any possibility that UK ministers might actively seek to block a future bid by Russia’s Gazprom for Centrica.” The priority, apparently, was to liberalise European energy markets and face down “economic nationalism”. In the event, of course, a bid never materialised – for which we can give thanks. The political naivety was extraordinary.",News/Business,Barclays CEO needs profits and fewer run-ins with regulators | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/feb/23/barclays-ceo-needs-profits-and-fewer-run-ins-with-regulators
2/24/2022,"Describing the manner in which Britain has been cravenly complicit in the laundering of Russian oligarchs’ wealth, one expert witness told the foreign affairs select committee in 2018: “We have had a welcome mat out to money – it has been financial investment as opposed to industrial investment over the past 20 years. We have had a regulatory stance that welcomed that money.” After accumulating a huge body of similar evidence, the MPs produced a report entitled “Moscow’s Gold: Russian Corruption in the UK”. Published in the wake of the novichok poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, it starkly concluded that President Vladimir Putin and his allies hid and laundered corrupt assets in London, drawing upon them when required. Nothing of any substance was done. A subsequent “Russia Report” of 2020, published by the intelligence and security committee, judged that oligarchs had become a corrupting force in British public life, using their money to make connections and exert undue influence. Again, the government response has been to delay and prevaricate.  As Vladimir Putin’s troops menace eastern Ukraine, and the world contemplates the possibility of a catastrophic war on European soil, the foot-dragging is inexcusable. Last week’s decision to shut down the so-called golden visa route for super-rich investors was welcome. But the exposure of the beneficiaries of dirty money already invested in Britain, and sweeping sanctions, should be a central part of any strategy to make Mr Putin realise the price of his aggression. “Londongrad” – a damning nickname which has been around for well over a decade – must finally be dismantled as a hub of Russian soft power and a safe conduit for Kremlin cronyism. The foot-dragging tells its own, unedifying story. Turning a blind eye to the dubious provenance of fabulous wealth, Britain has allowed Russian money to oil the wheels of politics, commerce and philanthropy, and make one of the world’s richest cities even richer. The anti-corruption organisation, Transparency International, estimates that more than £5bn of property bought in the UK has been acquired with wealth of suspicious provenance, one fifth of it from Russia. Functioning as an army of discreet butlers, a network of well-paid enablers have grown rich themselves by ensuring a congenial and accommodating financial environment. Since Boris Johnson became prime minister, the Conservative party has received at least £2m from donors with Russian links. It has benefited from the considerable generosity of figures such as Lubov Chernukin, now a British citizen and the wife of a former finance minister under Vladimir Putin; Ms Chernukin’s donations led to dinner with Theresa May and a game of tennis with Boris Johnson and David Cameron. The broader question of the timing, content and final scope of sanctions on the Putin regime is complex. Boris Johnson miscalculated in starting so small in his statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday. But there is a case for holding some measures in reserve as leverage, to be used in eleventh hour diplomatic efforts to dissuade Mr Putin from all-out invasion. In the event of further military aggression from Russia, European nations dependent on Russian energy have an invidious decision to make regarding how much pain they are willing to inflict on their own economies. The decision by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to freeze Nord Stream 2 was a welcome early show of commitment on that front, as was a new tranche of sanctions unveiled in Brussels. Calling time on “Londongrad” should be an easy call to make. On Wednesday, in prime minister’s questions, Sir Keir Starmer demanded an end to an “era of oligarch impunity” in Britain. It is past time for this to happen.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Ukraine crisis: calling time on Londongrad | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-ukraine-crisis-calling-time-on-londongrad
2/24/2022,"Like all great children’s storytellers or illustrators, the Polish-born artist Jan Pieńkowski instinctively understood that fear is an unavoidable and necessary part of childhood – and that how a child’s emotions are contained and held is crucial when it comes to an individual’s learning to operate in the world. Pieńkowski, who died on Saturday, used fear to great effect in his works: one of his early books with the writer Joan Aiken, with whom he had already collaborated on her story A Necklace of Raindrops, was a collection of central and eastern European fairy tales with many fantastical and terrifying elements, not least in his pictures of Baba Yaga, the witch who lives in a house that stands on chicken legs and flies about in her pestle and mortar – a character who was also a scary presence at Little Bulb’s children’s Christmas show, Wolf Witch Giant Fairy, at the Royal Opera House, London, last year. Pieńkowski was no stranger to fear – real, terrible fear. As a child in rural Poland, the son of a country squire, his existence had at first been idyllic and, from a 21st-century, post-industrial perspective, almost impossibly distant (the farm grew its own flax for cloth, which would be handspun before being woven). The coachman’s wife would tell him scary witch stories and then stop on a cliffhanger – only continuing when he’d drunk a hated cupful of boiled milk. But then came the war. The family moved to Warsaw. Frightening stories became frightening reality. He witnessed awful things in the city: “I have blotted out the screams. The noise has been obliterated,” he told Kirsty Young on Desert Island Discs in 2009. But as an adult he could never bear “shrill noises”, or screaming or people stampeding.  The “safe fear” contained in children’s stories was still something to be cherished and, his case, created. After the family moved to the UK, and Pieńkowski had studied classics and English at Cambridge, he turned again to his first love of drawing. Meg and Mog, the bestselling books he made with Helen Nicoll, were, admittedly, not very frightening, with their splendidly hapless witch heroine and her endless failed spells. But Haunted House, his wildly inventive 1979 pop-up book, really was, with its yellow-eyed cats peeping malevolently from roof-spaces, its haunted four-poster beds, and its skeletons in, literally, cupboards. There was also a great deal of humour: an octopus doing the washing up, a UFO lurking outside the window, and a crocodile in the bath. Funny and frightening were not so far apart – just as in, say, the dark pleasures of Heinrich Hoffmann’s Shock-headed Peter, in which Little Suck-a-Thumb has his offending digit cut off by a shears-wielding tailor, or indeed Edward Gorey’s various alphabets (though some parents may regard “A is for Amy who fell down the stairs, B is for Basil assaulted by bears” to be rather more of an adult than a child-appropriate pleasure). “What was nice about being frightened,” he told Young, “was that I was in a safe place. When you’re in bed and your father or mother is reading you a story you can be as petrified as you like – because you know you are safe.”",Opinion/Opinion,"The Guardian view on Jan Pieńkowski: funny, frightening, brilliant | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/23/the-guardian-view-on-jan-pienkowski-funny-frightening-brilliant
2/24/2022,"Two men have been charged with sending offensive or menacing messages to Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader. Greater Manchester police said Stuart Kelly, 53, from Halifax, and Michael McGrath, 71, from Sheffield, were charged with sending an offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing message to a woman in Tameside, Greater Manchester.  Kelly was charged over telephone calls made on 15 October last year to Rayner – the police statement identified her only as female and aged 42. McGrath was charged in connection with an email sent to Rayner on 16 October. Both were bailed ahead of an appearance at Westminster magistrates’ court on 17 March. Rayner, who is the MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, is a shadow Cabinet Office minister and shadow secretary of state for the future of work.

At the time the force said it was the fourth arrest, with one man previously having been charged and given a suspended prison sentence. A spokesman for Rayner said last month: “We are working with the police to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes are brought to justice and Angela would like to thank the police for their work during these investigations. “Abuse and threats of this nature don’t just have an impact on Angela but also on her family, her children and her staff, who are on the receiving end of these communications.”",News/Politics,Two charged over offensive messages sent to Angela Rayner,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/23/two-charged-over-offensive-messages-sent-to-angela-rayner
2/24/2022,"The actor Anna Karen, who has died in a house fire aged 85, was already appearing in a TV sitcom, Wild, Wild Women, as one of the workers in a millinery sweatshop, in 1969 when she was cast in another, in the role for which she is best remembered – Olive Rudge in the bawdy but hugely popular On the Buses. The writing team of Ronald Wolfe and Ronald Chesney, who created both programmes, conceived Olive as the dowdy, put-upon wife of the idle Arthur (played by Michael Robbins). They would appear alongside Reg Varney as Olive’s brother, the bus driver Stan Butler, Bob Grant as his conductor, Jack, Stephen Lewis as their boss, Inspector “Blakey” Blake, and Doris Hare as Olive and Stan’s domineering mother. (Hare was the original choice for the role but was out of the country when the programme began, so was replaced for the first series by Cicely Courtneidge.)  Halfway through the run of Wild, Wild Women, Karen fell ill with flu, but continued filming. “Ronald Chesney and Ronald Wolfe happened to be at rehearsals,” she told the journalist Richard Webber. “I felt and looked dreadful, but they said I was ideal for Olive. “The writers wanted her to look a mess, so I didn’t wear make-up, wore a wig that made my head look flat and had padding around my stomach to look plump. I based her on someone I knew in South Africa who was always desperate for men. She was terribly insecure, which applied to Olive, too.” The humour was based around Olive’s inability to cook and mentions of her husband’s “operation” as she weathered a barrage of misogynistic jokes from him. Her suggestions of an “early night” were invariably rebuffed. Although panned by the critics, On the Buses was an instant success, attracting up to 16 million viewers and running for seven series and 74 episodes, and ending in 1973 with Olive and Arthur’s divorce. There were also three spin-off films, On the Buses, which was the biggest British box office hit of 1971, Mutiny On the Buses (1972) and Holiday On the Buses (1973). Curiously, the part of Olive was transferred to another workplace sitcom, The Rag Trade (1977-78), when Chesney and Wolfe revived their 1960s hit about a modern-day sweatshop, Fenner’s Fashions, with Peter Jones and Miriam Karlin reprising their roles as Harold Fenner, the boss, and Paddy Fleming, the “militant” shop steward. Later, Karen appeared in the soap EastEnders as Aunt Sal – Sallie Martin – sister of Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) and aunt to Grant and Phil Mitchell (Ross Kemp and Steve McFadden), on and off from 1996 to 2017, usually turning up at family weddings and parties. Karen was born in Durban, South Africa. From deciding at the age of six that she wanted to be a vet, she switched her ambitions to acting after seeing the 1944 film National Velvet. She trained for three years at the South African National Theatre before moving to Britain when she was 16 with her mother and sister following the death of her father. When her family continued on their travels, Karen enrolled at Lamda in London to train as an actor. To fund herself through drama school, she performed as a striptease artist at the Panama Club and other London venues. “It was here I learned more about stage timings and entertaining a live audience than anyone can teach you at drama school,” she said. “I absorbed everything and even went on tour with brothers Syd and Max Harrison with their pantomime stage act.” She and other strippers had to adopt names from “the continent” and Karen – born Ana Caren Krege – changed hers to Anna Karen to sound Scandinavian. She then lived for four years in Italy, where her then husband was training to be an opera singer. She returned to Britain when the marriage broke up, rode elephants in a Christmas circus and appeared in the 1960 naturist film Nudist Memories. Karen worked with Syd and Max Harrison again in the film comedy The Sandwich Man (1966), starring Michael Bentine, and had a bit part as a neighbour in the director Ken Loach’s first feature film, Poor Cow (1967). Then, she was cast in the film comedy Carry On Camping (1969) as one of the finishing school “girls” seen in a catfight with Windsor and in the keep-fit scene. This led to a lifelong friendship with Windsor – Karen played Maude alongside her in Wild, Wild Women. She also had a small role in Carry On Loving (1970), minus Windsor, as a newlywed who has a plate of jelly pushed down the front of her dress. Fame from On the Buses brought Karen a starring role in the TV sitcom Troubles and Strife (1985-86) as the gin-swilling church caretaker Rosita Pearlman, a power behind the throne at St Anselm’s parish church. She also played the RatCave receptionist, Maureen McConkey, in Roland Rat: The Series (1986). On stage, she starred in national tours of the Ray Cooney farce Not Now Darling (1974), the Nell Dunn play Steaming (1984) and the Michael Frayn comedy Noises Off (1991), as well as appearing in many summer seasons and pantomimes, and directing Theatre in Education productions at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East. In 1967, Karen married the actor Terry Duggan, who worked with her many times on screen and stage; he died in 2008.
