2/26/2022,"Humpback whales have been removed from the threatened species list after a significant increase in numbers in the 60 years since they were first protected, but green groups warn populations could decline again as oceans warm. Global heating is predicted to have a significant impact on krill populations in Antarctica, a major feeding ground for humpback whales. The Australian environment minister, Sussan Ley, said removing the humpback whale from the threatened species list was “a recognition of the success of the outstanding conservation efforts that are in place”. International protections against whaling and domestic protections to preserve the species remain in place, Ley said. The number of humpback whales in Australian waters has grown from just 1,500 at the height of the commercial whaling industry to an estimated 40,000, Ley said. “Australia is a world leader in whale conservation, and we will continue to work through the International Whaling Commission to promote whale conservation and maintain the global moratorium on commercial whaling,” she said. “Our removal of the humpback from the threatened species list is based on science and sends a clear signal about what can be achieved through coordinated action. It is a message of hope for the welfare of a number of species.” Commercial whaling in the southern ocean in the 19th and early 20th century pushed many whale species, particularly the humpback and southern right, to the brink of extinction. More than 30,000 humpback whales were killed by whalers operating in Australia and New Zealand before local whaling operations ceased taking the species in 1963. They received international protection in 1965 in recognition of a dramatic decline in global numbers. The last commercial whaling station in Australia, the Cheynes Beach Whaling Company in Western Australia, closed in 1978 and Australia adopted an anti-whaling policy in 1979. Alexia Wellbelove, a senior campaign manager for Humane Society International, said while whale numbers had shown a “remarkable recovery” in the 60 years they received worldwide protection, the decision to delist the marine mammals “may prove to be short-sighted in the face of looming climate impacts”. “We are so appreciative of the concerted efforts undertaken to recover humpback whale populations, we would hate to see those efforts wasted by jumping the gun and removing the whale’s threatened status,” Wellbelove said. A 2019 study on the impact of historic whaling and future climate change on baleen whales – which includes humpbacks – in the southern ocean said that whole of ecosystem modelling, which linked krill levels to ocean temperature and declining sea ice, predicted “concerning” population declines and even some local extinctions by 2100. Another study in 2020 warned that rapid environmental change caused by the climate crisis appeared to be affecting breeding rates, with a significant decline in the number of humpback whale calves born in a major summer feeding ground for the whales in the northern hemisphere. Whales are also impacted by rising levels of plastics and other pollution in the ocean. They get entangled in fishing gear, swallow plastic, and are affected by ship strikes and noise disturbance. Wellbelove said she hoped to see “ongoing monitoring of humpback whale populations and swift restoration of their threatened status should the data indicate it is required”. Ley said the Australian government was investing in a long-term monitoring program.",News/Environment,Humpback whales removed from Australia’s threatened species list but feeding grounds still at risk,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/26/humpback-whales-removed-from-australias-threatened-species-list-but-feeding-grounds-still-at-risk
2/26/2022,"African countries are being forced to spend billions of dollars a year coping with the effects of the climate crisis, which is diverting potential investment from schools and hospitals and threatens to drive countries into ever deeper poverty. Dealing with extreme weather is costing close to 6% of GDP in Ethiopia alone, equating to a spend of more than $1 repairing climate damage for every $20 of national income, according to research by the thinktank Power Shift Africa. The warning comes just before the major new scientific report from the global authority on climate science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This report, the second part of the IPCC’s comprehensive summary of global climate science, will set out the consequences of climate breakdown across the world, looking at the floods, droughts, heatwaves and storms that are affecting food systems, water supplies and infrastructure. As global temperatures have risen in recent decades, and as the impact of extreme weather has become more apparent around the world, efforts to make infrastructure and communities more resilient have largely stalled. Africa will be one of the worst-hit regions, despite having done least to cause the climate crisis. According to the Power Shift Africa study, titled Adapt or Die: An analysis of African climate adaptation strategies, African countries will spend an average of 4% of GDP on adapting to climate breakdown. These countries include some of the world’s poorest people, whose responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions is many times less than those of people in developed countries, or in large emerging economies such as China. Sierra Leone will have to spend $90m a year on adapting to the climate crisis, though its citizens are responsible for about 0.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year each, while US citizens generate about 80 times more. Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, said: “This report shows the deep injustice of the climate emergency. Some of the poorest countries in the world are having to use scarce resources to adapt to a crisis not of their making. Despite only having tiny carbon footprints compared with those of the rich world, these African countries are suffering from droughts, storms and floods which are putting already stretched public finances under strain and limiting their ability to tackle other problems.” He called for more funding from developed countries, which promised at the Cop26 UN climate summit to double the money available to help poor countries adapt to the climate crisis. Rich countries promised in 2009 to provide $100bn a year to help poor countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the effects of climate breakdown. But so far they have fallen short of that target, and most of the funds that have been provided have gone to projects to cut emissions, such as windfarms and solar panels, rather than efforts to help countries adapt. The study examined national adaptation plans submitted to the UN by seven African countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, South Sudan and Togo. South Sudan, which is the world’s second poorest country, was hit by floods last year that displaced 850,000 people, and led to outbreaks of water-borne diseases. The country is to spend $376m a year on adaptation, about 3.1% of its GDP. Chukwumerije Okereke, director of the centre for climate change and development at the Alex Ekwueme Federal University in Nigeria, said rich countries must respond to the findings, and to the IPCC report. “It is both irresponsible and immoral for those that are the chief cause of climate change to look on while Africa, which has contributed next to nothing to climate change, continues to bear a disproportionate share of the impact,” he said. “The time for warm words is long gone. We need urgent, scaled-up, long-term support from the world-leading climate polluters.”",News/Environment,African countries spending billions to cope with climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/26/african-countries-spending-billions-to-cope-with-climate-crisis
2/26/2022,"Councils across England are urging householders to set up a direct debit payment for their council tax so that they can automatically receive the government’s £150 energy rebate in April. The payment is designed to help offset some of the huge rise in gas and electricity costs due to take effect the same month and will be paid to those living in properties in council tax bands A-D. About 80% of households qualify for help, but while the money will be paid straight into the bank accounts of those who have a direct debit set up with their local council, anyone paying by any other means will need to make a claim. The Local Government Association said this meant the payments would take longer as councils would need to first contact the households and then make pre-payment checks before giving the rebate. It said in some parts of the country, thousands of households were not set up to receive the payment automatically. Hull city council, for example, has estimated that it does not have bank details for 60,000 households, while Dartford council has reported that 15,000 households do not pay by direct debit. Shaun Davies, the chair of the LGA’s resources board, said: “This year will be tougher than most, particularly for those on lower incomes, so it is good that the government is stepping in to provide financial support to help ease these pressures.” He added: “You can still get the money if you don’t have a direct debit set up, but it could take longer as your council will have to contact you and then you’ll have to make a claim.” Charities have expressed concern that the way the payments will be distributed means those most in need could miss out. When the policy was first announced, Citizens Advice said it was “a complicated lottery that means support is not targeted at people who really need it”, and called on the government to use the benefits system to deliver the money.",Lifestyle/Money,People in England told to pay council tax by direct debit to get £150 rebate,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/26/energy-bills-council-tax-direct-debit-rebate-gas-electricity-prices
2/26/2022,"Australia plans to join its allies in personally sanctioning Vladimir Putin and the Russian foreign affairs minister over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine – but says it will not expel Russian diplomats from the country at this stage. The government flagged the move amid growing fears of an all-out Russian assault on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and as Russia used its veto power to block a UN security council resolution deploring the invasion. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said she was taking advice from her department on expanding sanctions to include the Russian president, who would be “personally responsible for the deaths and the suffering of innocent Ukrainians”. Payne said while sanctioning a country’s leader was an exceptional step, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was “an exceptional situation”. Addressing reporters in Sydney on Saturday, she said Putin had “lied, deceived, fabricated and shown no interest in genuine dialogue”. “Vladimir Putin has unparalleled personal power over his country and he has chosen to go to war against a neighbour that posed no threat to Russia, because he wants to reverse history and take away the freedom and the democracy that the Ukranian people chose for themselves,” Payne said. “It is clear that the only way to exact a cost for those actions is to ensure that he, himself, shares some of that cost and some of the pain that he is inflicting on everyone else around him in Ukraine.” Payne foreshadowed the action as she noted announcements by the UK, the US, the EU and Canada that they would personally sanction Putin and Russia’s foreign affairs minister, Sergei Lavrov. She was “seeking advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to enable Australia to take similar steps”. Putin and Lavrov were not included when the Australian government announced on Wednesday the first round of sanctions on eight of the 12 permanent members of the Russian security council. Putin chairs that body. On Saturday, Payne said the government would also be imposing sanctions on eight Russian oligarchs who are seen as close to Putin, 339 members of Russia’s parliament “who are the political facilitators of this action”, and key figures in Belarusian government who aided the invasion. Australia’s trade and economic relationship with Russia is very limited, leading some experts to say Australian sanctions are largely symbolic. But Payne on Saturday stressed the importance of the international community showing unity “to ensure that Russia faces a high cost for what is a completely unprovoked and unjustified attack on its neighbour”. The Australian government has been critical of Beijing’s response, including its decision to fully open up to Russian wheat exports, which had previously been subject to health-related restrictions. But Australia’s partner in the Quad grouping, India, has been exploring ways to set up a rupee payment mechanism for trade with Russia to soften the blow on New Delhi of western sanctions, according to a Reuters report. India joined China and the UAE in abstaining from Friday’s vote on the UN security council resolution that criticised Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia was the sole vote against the resolution – in what some observers said was a sign of Moscow’s isolation - but given its veto power was able to block its passage. Asked whether she was concerned about India’s stance, and would encourage it to take a stronger position, Payne said every country would “make its own decisions about how it deals with these issues”. “It is, however, Australia’s clear view that we should call out illegal war and coercion and aggression for what they are,” she said. Payne noted that India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, had appealed to Putin for immediate cessation of violence. The minister said she had indicated several times that the option of expelling Russian diplomats from Australia remained “a live option”, but it was important to maintain a direct line of communication with the Russian government. “It is not something that we are considering currently,” she said. “It remains an option but not something we are proceeding with at this point.” The head of Dfat has spoken directly with the Russian ambassador, Alexey Pavlovsky, to express Australia’s position. Pavlovsky gave a lengthy press conference last month in which he denied the buildup of Russian troops near the border with Ukraine was a sign of aggression, and said Russia was acting rationally in raising its concerns about the expansion of Nato. Putin had wanted a guarantee that Ukraine would never join Nato. On Friday, the Russian embassy in Canberra defended the military operation to “demilitarise” Ukraine, saying the move was to “defend our country from those who have taken Ukraine hostage and have been trying to use it against Russia and our people”. It has previously said sanctions would have no effect. But both sides of Australian politics have denounced Putin’s actions as an “unprovoked” and “shameful act of aggression” contrary to international law. Amid estimates from the UN refugee agency that 100,000 people have already fled their homes, Payne described the humanitarian situation in Ukraine as “serious” and “likely to escalate”. She said the Australian government would be “ready to provide humanitarian assistance as the situation in Ukraine and in surrounding countries becomes clearer”, without detailing any specifics. Payne confirmed on Saturday that she would meet “in due course” with the new Chinese ambassador to Australia, amid ongoing diplomatic tensions between the two countries and with the federal election looming in May. “I will meet with him and we’ll have discussions,” she said. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Friday played down the significance of a gesture from the ambassador, Xiao Qian, who said China and Australia should “meet each other halfway” and “look into the future”. Morrison said the 14 points on the list of grievances issued by the Chinese embassy in 2020 were “not for negotiating”. The prime minister also said it was “inexplicable” and “completely unacceptable” for the Chinese government to ease trade restrictions on Russia at a time when other countries were ratcheting up sanctions for the invasion.",News/Australia news,Australia plans to join allies in personally sanctioning Putin and says expulsion of Russian diplomats a ‘live option’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/26/australia-russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-sergei-lavrov

The image, taken after the Chinese government had brutally cracked down on pro-democracy protests, has become a symbol of defiance in the face of authoritarianism, and was named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential of all time. “Amazingly brave Ukrainian tries to stop a Russian military convoy by blocking the vehicles with his body just like the ‘Tank Man’ in Tiananmen Square,” Henry Langston, a freelance journalist, tweeted. In the clip someone can be heard gasping as a truck appears to swerve around the man in the road. One of the vehicles veers off the side of the road in order to get past. It is unclear where the video was filmed. More than 10 vehicles are in the convoy, many of which appear to have a “Z” painted on the side.
