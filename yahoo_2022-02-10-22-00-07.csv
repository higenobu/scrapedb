2/10/2022,"New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman unveiled the name and title of her book on former President Donald Trump on Thursday, and Axios, which says Haberman's Confidence Man will be ""the book Trump fears most,"" got a sneak peak at some of her discoveries. Trump, for instance, reportedly has told people he has kept in contact with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un since leaving office. But the most eye-catching scoop involves clogged toilets. Whiile Trump was in office, White House residence staff would occasionally discover wads of printed paper clogging a toilet and believed Trump had tried to flush it down, Axios reports, citing Haberman's book. Trump was, at times, fixated on toilets that wouldn't flush, as The Washington Post's Philip Bump noted. Axios calls Trump's reputed toilet-clogging ""a vivid new dimension to his lapses in preserving government documents,"" a polite nod to the 15 boxes of papers the National Archives had to retrieve from Mar-a-Lago last month to put Trump in compliance with the Presidential Records Act, his possible mishandling of classified documents, and his habit of ripping up papers after reading them, among other long-reported compliance issues. Top White House officials were so ""deeply concerned"" about Trump's handling of sensitive national security material that one of this chiefs of staff, John Kelly, ""tried to stop classified documents from being taken out of the Oval Office and brought up to the residence because he was concerned about what Mr. Trump may do with them and how that may jeopardize national security,"" the Times reported Wednesday. Former Trump aide Omarosa Manigault Newman wrote in her 2018 Trump White House book, Unhinged, that she saw Trump ""put a note in his mouth"" in the Oval Office ""appeared to be chewing and swallowing the paper,"" a shocking action for a famous ""germaphobe.""

2/10/2022,"Struggling U.S. skier Mikaela Shiffrin is cutting out interviews at the Beijing Winter Olympics. After disqualifications in the giant slalom and slalom generated controversial TV coverage that included a raw interview with NBC, the two-time gold medalist issued a statement through a U.S. Olympic spokesperson on Thursday (per Reuters): “Mikaela (nor her mother/coach Eileen) will not be doing any media for the foreseeable future. Thank you for respecting her/their space right now.” NBC’s cameras trained on the crestfallen Shiffrin after she shockingly missed a gate early in the slalom on Wednesday. Then she said in a heart-wrenching interview with the network that her performance “makes me second-guess the last 15 years. ... Just processing a lot for sure, and I feel really bad.” The coverage received widespread criticism for focusing so intently on Shiffrin’s disappointment. Some viewers compared it with the harsh spotlight on gymnast Simone Biles, whose mental health concerns prompted her to drop out of some events at last year’s Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Shiffrin fielded questions from reporters for 45 minutes after her elimination in the slalom, according to NBC. Apparently, that was enough for her. She’s set to compete Friday in the Super-G, the U.S. ski team announced. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

2/10/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Reporters covering the Pentagon and U.S. military are protesting what they say is a refusal to allow access to the approximately 3,000 U.S. troops being deployed in Europe in response to rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Pentagon reporters say they have been denied opportunities to interview or embed with the newly arriving troops, who are being sent to Poland, Romania and Germany as a gesture of reassurance to NATO allies in the face of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine, which is not a NATO ally. The journalists say such blanket restrictions are rare during peacetime and unusual even in active warzones. Russia has amassed some 100,000 troops on the borders of Ukraine, some for joint military exercises in Belarus, but insists it has no intentions of invading Ukraine. President Joe Biden has ordered additional U.S. troops deployed to Poland, Romania and Germany. Poland borders both Russia and Ukraine, while Romania borders Ukraine. There are no plans to send U.S. combat troops to Ukraine. The Pentagon Press Association, representing nearly 100 journalists who cover the Department of Defense, says the Biden administration has essentially banned access to the newly deployed rank-and-file soldiers in Europe. The group appealed to the Biden administration in a letter Wednesday addressed to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and national security adviser Jake Sullivan. The letter describes the denial of media access as “contrary to the basic principle of press freedom,” and asks the Biden administration to reverse course. ""It is a disservice to an American public in whose name these troops are deploying abroad, and it runs counter to President Biden’s pledges of transparency,"" the letter states. “The public in a democratic society deserves independent media coverage of their sons and daughters in uniform, and that cannot be provided today without first-hand, on-the-ground reporting of troop activities in Europe.” Associated Press national security writer Robert Burns is the association's president. “Restricting access to U.S. troops in Europe during a period of intense global interest is a disservice to the public, who rely on independent journalists to report what is actually happening on the ground,” AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said in a statement. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby on Wednesday said decisions about limitations on coverage are part of a broader U.S. government strategy for managing the Ukraine crisis on the “geo-political stage” in search of a diplomatic solution. “Any decision to provide media access to our troops, whether it’s in an operational environment or a training environment, is a decision that we take seriously,” Kirby said. “We’re just not at a point now where we are able to provide that kind of access.” Kirby noted that it's a sensitive moment diplomatically as the U.S. and its allies try to prevent a Russian invasion. “We believe there is still time and space for diplomacy,” he said. “We still believe that there’s headspace with Mr. Putin that can be operated inside. We still believe that he hasn’t made a final decision” to invade Ukraine. ___ Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,Reporters: US military blocking access to troops in Europe,https://news.yahoo.com/reporters-us-military-blocking-access-224447896.html
2/10/2022,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO's secretary general warned on Thursday of a ""dangerous moment"" for Europe as Russia builds up troops near Ukraine and holds joint military drills in Belarus, but reiterated an offer of talks with Moscow. Jens Stoltenberg, speaking alongside British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, said he had sent a letter to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov offering to discuss more transparency around exercises, as well as nuclear arms control. ""This is a dangerous moment for European security,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference with Johnson. ""The number of Russian forces is going up. The warning time for a possible attack is going down."" ""NATO is not a threat to Russia, but we must be prepared for the worst while remaining strongly committed to finding a political solution,"" Stoltenberg said. He said Russia must choose between a diplomatic solution to the crisis over Ukraine or face economic sanctions from the West and an increased military presence of NATO forces in the alliance's eastern countries. ""Russia has a choice: they can either choose a diplomatic solution - and we're ready to sit down - but if they choose confrontation, they will pay a higher price,"" he said. ""There will be economic sanctions. There will be an increased NATO military presence in the eastern part of the alliance, and the UK is really an important part of that.""
