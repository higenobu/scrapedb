5/12/2022,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) published a press release on Monday detailing a brief that he and 84 legislators filed to the Supreme Court that calls for an end to discrimination against Asian American college applicants.

Cruz spearheaded the brief with Korean American Congresswoman Michelle Steel (R, CA-48), who has consistently denounced elite higher education institutions’ admission policies that factor in an applicant’s race to promote campus diversity.

Cruz and Steel rallied the support of 13 Republican Senators, including Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Rand Paul (R-KY), and 70 Republican House Representatives. Steel’s fellow Korean American California representative Young Kim (R, CA-29) was also on the list of signees.

The filing lists “Students for fair admissions” (petitioners) versus the “President and fellows of Harvard College” (respondents) and also the “Students for fair admissions” (petitioners) versus the “University of North Carolina et. al.” (respondents).

The brief begins with the purpose of intent, which states that all members of the Senate and House were committed to the principle of equality under law “as guaranteed” by the 14th Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin among other things.

Legislators argued that “no American should be denied educational opportunities because of race,” citing the rejection of Asian American applicants due to their race by Harvard and the University of North Carolina as unconstitutional.

The brief went on to label Asian Americans as victims of discrimination, arguing that race-conscious admissions single out Asian American applicants.

“Race-conscious admissions decisions inflict a heavy toll on Asian-American students. Treating them differently because of their race is a stark departure from equal protection decisions issued early on by this Court, which guarded Asian immigrants from racial prejudice. And the burdens imposed on petitioner illustrate a wider trend. Asian-Americans are increasingly victimized by discriminatory practices.”

The brief also included a petition to overrule Grutter v. Bollinger, the 2003 landmark case in which a white law school applicant, Barbara Grutter, was denied admissions from Michigan Law despite her impressive qualifications, including a 3.8 undergraduate GPA and LSAT score of 161.

The Michigan Law School responded by saying that the race of an applicant was taken into consideration in making its decision to not admit her because it serves a “compelling interest in achieving diversity among its student body.”

The Supreme Court ruled that a university may adopt “narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.”

The very justification of “racial balancing,” GOP representatives argued, is “an aim that is unconstitutional on its face,” with the Grutter case being a “constitutional outlier.”

They added that race-conscious college admissions, laws and policies should only “survive judicial scrutiny” if “necessary to remedy the effects of an institution’s past discrimination.”

The brief also raised the question of why the protections that originated from the Brown v. Board of Education case should not extend to higher education.

“No one has convincingly explained why dividing schoolchildren by race is unconstitutional while dividing young adults by race is permissible.”

The presence of Asian Americans in the GOP has been on the rise, with the New York state GOP announcing its new Asian American caucus earlier this year and Asian American districts having been found to favor GOP candidates.

If Grutter v. Bollinger is overruled, it might be seen as a big victory for the GOP in demonstrating their support to Asian Americans.

A GOP victory would also mark an end to affirmative action policies that work to increase the enrollment and representation of underrepresented, primarily Black and Hispanic, students.

5/12/2022,"The UK's Advertising Standards Authority has banned Adidas' sports bra ads featuring bare breasts. Some complainants told the ASA that the ads ""objectified women"" and reduced them to body parts. Adidas had released the ads to highlight the diversity of breasts and promote its sports bra range. The UK has banned a series of adverts for Adidas sports bras that featured bare breasts. In complaints to the UK's Advertising Standards Authority, some people said that the adverts objectified and sexualized women and were inappropriate for children. Adidas released the ad campaign in February, which included both social-media posts and posters featuring images of a variety of exposed breasts, in some cases with the nipples blurred out. The campaign was released to highlight the uniqueness and diversity of breasts and promote the 72 sizes included in Adidas' sports bra range, the company said. The posters were accompanied by text reading: ""The reasons we didn't make just one new sports bra."" Posts on Instagram and Twitter had longer captions with a similar sentiment. But the campaign sparked controversy online, with some social-media users describing the image as ""distasteful"" and ""explicit."" The ASA said it received 24 complaints about the campaign. Some said that the ads may have been ""harmful and offensive"" because they ""objectified women by sexualizing them and reducing them to body parts,"" per the ASA. Complainants also questioned whether the posters, which were displayed in public places, were appropriate for children. Some social-media users have lauded Adidas for the campaign, however, commenting on the Instagram post with heart and clapping emojis. ""Thank you for showing more brown breasts than the average health textbook!"" one comment reads. ""Although we did not consider that the way the women were portrayed was sexually explicit or objectified them, we considered that the depiction of naked breasts was likely to be seen as explicit nudity,"" the ASA said Wednesday. ""We noted the breasts were the main focus in the ads, and there was less emphasis on the bras themselves, which were only referred to in the accompanying text."" The ASA said that that because the posters contained explicit nudity and were displayed in places where they were likely to be seen by children, they were ""inappropriately targeted, and were likely to cause widespread offence."" The tweet featuring the image was ""not in keeping with their usual content"" and was therefore ""likely to cause widespread offence,"" the ASA said. ""The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of,"" the ASA said. ""We told Adidas UK Ltd to ensure their ads did not cause offence and were targeted responsibly."" Adidas told Insider: ""The gallery creative was designed to show just how diverse breasts are, featuring different shapes and sizes that highlight why tailored support is paramount."" ""It is important to note that the ASA ruling was related to this creative being used in an untargeted fashion rather than the creative itself and the message, which we stand proudly behind,"" the company added. The ASA said that Adidas UK had released the images to ""reflect and celebrate different shapes and sizes, illustrate diversity, and demonstrate why tailored support bras were important"" and hasn't considered the ads as sexual. Adidas told the ASA that it had submitted the ads to the Committees of Advertising Practice, who had said the images weren't sexual but that the use of nudity brought risk. As a result, Adidas didn't place the ads near schools or religious venues, it said.
