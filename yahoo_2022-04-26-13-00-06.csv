4/26/2022,"Video released Monday shows what authorities said was a suspect walking down a Northern California street with a baby carrier after allegedly kidnapping a 3-month-old boy from his family's apartment. The suspect allegedly entered the home just north of downtown San Jose shortly after 1 p.m. and left with Brandon Cuellar, San Jose police spokesman Sgt. Christian Camarillo told reporters. The boy's grandmother was watching the infant while his mother was at work, Camarillo said. The grandmother had returned home from a trip to the grocery store with Brandon and taken him into the apartment, Camarillo said. She left the boy for approximately two minutes to get groceries from the car, Camarillo said. ""In that short amount of time, someone entered the apartment"" and left with the child, Camarillo said. ""Today, someone is walking around with a 3-month-old baby they did not have yesterday,"" he added. The boy's family did not recognize the man, who was captured on surveillance camera carrying what authorities described as a baby carrier with a white blanket over it. Camarillo said it wasn't clear if the man brought the carrier or if it belonged to the family. Brandon was wearing a white long-sleeve onesie with dinosaurs on it, the department said. Camarillo said members of an FBI child abduction team are assisting in the search for the boy.",U.S./NBC News,"3-month-old kidnapped as grandmother unloaded groceries in California, police say",https://news.yahoo.com/3-month-old-kidnapped-grandmother-030209670.html
4/26/2022,"About 15,000 Russian troops have died in the invasion of Ukraine, per UK's defense secretary. Roughly the same number of Soviet soldiers died during the nine-year war in Afghanistan. At least 2,665 civilians have been killed in Ukraine to date, according to the UN's OHCHR. In nearly nine weeks, Russia lost as many troops during its invasion of Ukraine as it did in the nine years of the Soviet War in Afghanistan. ""It is our assessment that approximately 15,000 Russian personnel have been killed during their offensive,"" Ben Wallace, UK's Secretary of State for Defense said in a statement released by the British embassy in Washington on Monday. He also estimated that approximately a quarter of the battalion tactical groups were ""not combat effective."" The Soviet War in Afghanistan lasted from 1979 to 1989. Many scholars partially attributed the Soviet Union's 1991 collapse to the military failure in the war. About 14,500 Soviet soldiers died then — along with 90,000 Mujahideen soldiers, 18,000 Afghan soldiers, and approximately one million civilians, The Atlantic reported in 2014. Wallace similarly pointed to a ""failure of the Russian Ministry of Defence command and control at all levels."" He also singled out Russia's equipment losses, including the Moskva warship, which sank on April 14 after a Ukrainian missile attack. ""Last week Russia admitted that the Slava-class cruiser Moskva has sunk – the second key naval asset that they have lost since invading – significantly weakening their ability to bring their maritime assets to bear from the Black Sea,"" he said in his remarks, delivered to the House of Commons on Ukraine. ""Russia has so far failed in nearly every one of its objectives,"" he added. Since Vladimir Putin waged war on Ukraine on February 24, at least 2,665 civilians have been killed in Ukraine, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on Monday, which says the actual number is likely much higher. The UK Secretary of State for Defence also estimated that more than 2,000 Russian armored vehicles were totaled or seized, including ""at least 530 tanks, 530 Armoured Personnel Carriers and 560 Infantry Fighting Vehicles."" They estimate that the country has also lost at least 60 helicopters and fighter jets. Wallace said Ukraine has ""endured indiscriminate bombardment, war crimes, and overwhelming military aggression."" ""But they have stood firm, galvanized the international community, and beaten back the army of Russia in the North and the North-East,"" he added.

4/26/2022,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — At home, two-term Republican Sen. John Boozman is known as an unassuming figure who talks almost in a whisper and is more comfortable chatting about policy or the University of Arkansas Razorbacks' football record than giving fiery speeches. But you wouldn't know that if you turned on the television lately. “John Boozman has always stood up to the gun-grabbing liberals of Washington,"" a local sheriff says in one Boozman ad. In another, fellow Republican Sen. Tom Cotton hails Boozman as “our conservative fighter."" Boozman promises to finish building the wall along the U.S. border with Mexico that Donald Trump promised. The sharper tone is Boozman's effort to deal with an awkward problem as he seeks reelection in a Republican stronghold that Trump won overwhelmingly two years ago: Conservative voters are restive with Trump out of power, and GOP candidates are expected to sound bristling mad about it. Boozman said the ads are not inconsistent with his low-key style and that he is just focusing on concerns he is hearing from voters. “These are the things that are on people's minds, so what we're trying to do is address those issues and help them understand we're at the forefront of working hard to get something done,"" Boozman said. “I'm not an individual that screams and hollers. I'm an individual that gets to work and gets results."" But ferocity just does not come naturally to Boozman. His more combative friends are rallying to help with that. “He doesn’t draw attention to himself,"" Republican strategist Bill Vickery said of the 71-year-old eye doctor and former Razorbacks football player. “He sort of lets his record speak for himself."" In GOP-led states, even Republicans with seemingly safe seats are trying to ward off any perceptions they are insufficiently loyal to the former president. Such concerns already led Trump to withdraw his endorsement of Mo Brooks in Alabama's Senate race, and have driven him to back an effort to unseat Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in that state's primary. Boozman has received Trump's endorsement along with the backing of top Republican figures in Arkansas. That includes Sarah Sanders, the party’s likely nominee for governor who was as Trump’s press secretary. Boozman also has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association and National Right to Life. His chief rival in the May 24 primary is Jake Bequette, a former NFL and Razorbacks player who served in the Army and has appeared frequently on Fox News. Bequette's fundraising has paled in comparison to Boozman's, but he is backed by a super political action committee supported by shipping executive Richard Uihlein. “I think in this political environment, the people of Arkansas and America First patriots around the country, they want conservative warriors,” Bequette said. Boozman's other GOP challengers include Jan Morgan, a former TV reporter and conservative activist who has appeared at the state Capitol frequently to push for bans on vaccine mandates and for looser gun laws. Both have regularly assailed Boozman as a RINO — Republican In Name Only — even though the incumbent voted more than 91% of the time with Trump, according to the website FiveThirtyEight. Boozman has voted with President Joe Biden 34% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight's tally, and his challengers say that is too often. One of the main areas of attack is Boozman's decision to not challenge Biden's victory in the 2020 election, despite Trump's lies that the election was stolen. Boozman's rivals have also criticized the senator for saying Trump bore “some responsibility"" for the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. Boozman voted to acquit Trump during impeachment proceedings. Boozman said he does not think Trump bears direct responsibility for the riot, and he has called the House committee investigating Jan. 6 a “partisan charade.” Boozman said he remains committed to Trump and would support him for president in 2024. “I do know if he was president now, we would be in a much better position than having President Biden,"" Boozman said. With hardly any public polling available, there are few signs indicating trouble for Boozman. The incumbent has been outraising his rivals and blanketing the state with ads, including the one featuring Cotton, a potential White House candidate in 2024. Two super PACs supporting Boozman have recently begun airing TV ads. Boozman has focused on farming and veterans issues during his time in the Senate, topics that do not lend themselves to viral videos or incendiary speeches but are crucial in this predominantly rural state. He is in line to lead the powerful Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee should the GOP win control of the Senate this fall. Boozman compared his approach to that of the football coaches he said influenced him the most in school. “They didn't just scream and holler. They put game plans in place and worked toward a common goal to get things done versus just screaming about it,"" Boozman said.",Politics/Associated Press,Ads from soft-spoken Arkansas Sen.
