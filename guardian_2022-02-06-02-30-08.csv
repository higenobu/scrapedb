2/6/2022,"Grand statements can look dangerously premature with a relegation fight ahead but Goodison Park already feels like a different place under Frank Lampard. The new Everton manager enjoyed a dream start, and the biggest win of any managerial debut in the club’s history, as Brentford were easily swept aside in the FA Cup fourth round. A performance of character and enterprise brought Everton into the fifth round and Lampard into the embrace of an appreciative crowd. Four different goalscorers – Yerry Mina, Richarlison, Mason Holgate and Andros Townsend – helped Everton to their biggest win of the season against Thomas Frank’s team, who only fleetingly threatened to disturb the script.  Lampard received a tumultuous reception when introduced to the Goodison crowd before kick-off. A banner was draped over the front of the upper Gwladys Street End that read ‘Best of luck Frank’. Another, featuring Howard Kendall, the trophies won during his reign and ‘Nothing but the best, our motto is our standard’ provided a little reminder of what is expected of any Everton manager. Premier League survival, however, is the immediate priority for the club’s sixth permanent manager in under six years. The former Chelsea and Derby manager oversaw the warmup, something that David Moyes did when he first arrived at Goodison, while new first-team coach Ashley Cole took a place high up in the Main Stand to survey the match itself. It was a competitive, physical contest from the outset with both sides struggling to create clear-cut opportunities, although the improvement in Everton’s desire for the ball and willingness to take the game to Brentford was immediate. Incisive runs from Demarai Gray and Anthony Gordon were a prominent feature of the hosts’ first-half display. Lampard suffered an early setback when Ben Godfrey, who started on the left of a back three, pulled up with a serious looking injury. His replacement, Mina, made his mark in emphatic style 17 minutes later. Everton’s initial threat came from distance with Gordon curling a left-footed shot just over David Raya’s crossbar and André Gomes’s 25-yard drive forcing the goalkeeper to tip over. Raya was making his first appearance since sustaining a knee injury against Leicester in October. It was also four months since Everton last scored a game’s opening goal. That sorry statistic was rectified from the corner that came via Gomes’s effort. Gray delivered an inswinger with pace and Mina, despite nearly having his shirt pulled off his back, planted an unstoppable header past Raya for the first goal of the Lampard era. Goodison was vibrant but Brentford responded with their first genuine spell of pressure in the tie. A flowing move ended in Sergi Canós sweeping an instinctive shot towards the top corner but Jordan Pickford reacted with a fine stop. Richarlison and Gray both missed awkward chances to extend Everton’s advantage before a half-time interval in which new signings Dele Alli and Donny van de Beek were also introduced to the home crowd. The two midfielders are ineligible for the FA Cup but will be in contention for Tuesday’s critical Premier League visit to Newcastle. Everton should arrive at St James’ Park with confidence renewed. Richarlison gave Lampard’s new team the comfort of a two-goal lead within minutes of the restart. Played in behind Pontus Jansson by a perfectly weighted chip from Allan, the Brazil international beat the advancing Raya with a composed finish under pressure. Brentford reacted well once again, although sparking into life only after conceding a goal brought little consolation to Frank and their sizeable away support. Ivan Toney instigated a feud with Pickford all afternoon but was on the receiving end when felled by the England goalkeeper as he raced on to Christian Nørgaard’s incisive pass into the Everton penalty area. Michael Oliver pointed to the spot and, as in Brentford’s 1-0 win over Rafael Benítez’s sorry team in November, Toney confidently beat Pickford with a cooly-taken penalty. At other points this season Everton and their uncertain defence may have folded under pressure. Not this time. Holgate restored the hosts’ two-goal cushion when glancing in at close range after Mina had headed on another dangerous corner from Gray. The corner arrived after Gordon dispossessed Mads Bech Sørensen to create a chance out of nothing for Gomes. Just the kind of spirit and tenacity that Lampard craves, and has been lacking. In stoppage time substitute Townsend sealed an impressive victory with a low finish into the bottom corner after a flowing one-touch move. Goodison felt like a different place.",Sport/Football,Everton overwhelm Brentford in FA Cup to give Frank Lampard dream start,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/everton-brentford-fa-cup-match-report
2/6/2022,"For many students and alumni of historically Black colleges and universities, the wave of bomb threats on the campuses feel like history repeating itself.  “I was caught off-guard because we’re in 2022 and still facing the same problems as our grandparents and their grandparents,” said Marian Turner, an international studies major at Spelman College in Atlanta, referring to a time before the gains of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. “It just really brings to light everything that’s happening, because we’re actually experiencing it.” Turner remembers checking her email two hours before a 9 am class on Tuesday , the day Spelman and a dozen other historically black colleges, or HBCUs, received bomb threats, the second such wave targeting the schools in a month. It would have been her first day of in-person classes since the Omicron variant delayed a return to campus. She was glad campus was empty at the time of the threat, but still felt outrage, fear and even defiance. So she decided to go on campus, but ended up leaving to avoid putting herself in danger. Instead, she attended class virtually. The threats at dozens of the nation’s 100 HBCUs – colleges that have produced a who’s who of leaders, promoted a sense of purpose, and provided a sanctuary from racism and discrimination in higher education – have shaken Black communities across the country. The institutions have played a powerful role, dating back to the end of slavery and Reconstruction, and are viewed by many as a symbol of Black achievement and cultural pride. The FBI is investigating the hoax bomb threats as racially motivated hate crimes. No explosive devices have been found on the campuses, but the threats have forced the cancellation of thousands of classes and spurred campus lockdowns. Six juveniles have been identified as persons of interest in the investigation, according to NBC News. “It’s just another day of seeing us get disrespected. As Black students, or just Black people in general, we continue to try to break barriers and find our voices in society,” Turner said. “We’re already a minority, but it’s like we take a step forward and these people who are against us bring us back. I shouldn’t have to live in fear when I’m just going to get an education.” HBCUs have a long legacy of educating some of the nation’s most prominent Black Americans, from the Rev Martin Luther King, a graduate of Morehouse College in Atlanta, to vice-president Kamala Harris, a graduate of Howard University in Washington. The UNCF, an education organization that supports HBCUs, states that the colleges make up only 3% of US colleges but produce more than 20% of all Black graduates, demonstrating their importance in both higher education and American society. “These schools are remarkable for their resilience, fortitude and dedication to community, and serve a mission of inclusion and opportunity,” said Damon Hewitt, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, in a statement. Millicent Springs-Campbell is a graduate of Howard who lives in Atlanta. She visited her alma mater two months ago with her daughter, who was recently accepted to the university. She said initially she felt anxiety for students and faculty because Howard’s school grounds are not gated. That quickly turned to anger. “I think it was targeted to threaten the actual legacy of HBCUs,” Springs-Campbell said. “I liken it to when Black churches are threatened. It’s more than just a threat to the physical buildings, but what they stand for.” Despite the threats, she still wants her daughter to attend Howard, if she chooses. “I wouldn’t want one cowardly act by whoever is behind it to persuade her decision in going to the best institution for her.” Howard and Spelman enjoy more notoriety than many other HBCUs due to high-profile alumni and their location in major US cities. But other schools that normally fly under the national radar were also threatened. Rahman Johnson teaches mass communications at Edward Waters University, a HBCU in Jacksonville, Florida, with just over 1,000 students. Johnson received his bachelor’s degree from there, as did his late grandmother. He’s also a doctoral candidate at Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi, which also received a bomb threat. He took the dual intimidation personally. “It felt like a gut punch,” Johnson said. “I felt as though I was back living in the time of my grandmother. And while I don’t have the hindrances of her being a Black girl growing up in the south at that time, I felt that we’re in it again.” Johnson said he got a call before 5am alerting him to the threats, but wanted to keep his habit of working out, so he prepared to visit the gym, purposely wearing an Edward Waters University tank top. He said he felt a tinge of worry, but the desire to be an example of courage for his students led him to keep the shirt on. “If someone happened to see me, I did not want my students to even think that I would shrink, or that we should shrink. I am part of the fabric of America, and we cannot allow bigotry or hate from those who don’t understand us or have the intelligence to articulate how they feel, to push us into a corner.” The Rev Janette Wilson, the national executive director of Push for Excellence, founded by the Rev Jesse Jackson, says she sees the bomb threats as part of a “storm of hatred” sweeping the country – a continued reaction to progress made since the civil rights movement. “When you look at the states where the bomb threats occurred, these are southern states, where the states’ rights agenda is being pushed at the highest level, where the criminal justice system hasn’t come into the 20th century,” said Wilson. “There’s a desire to create a level of fear on those campuses and discourage students from attending HBCUs, where most of our Black doctors, lawyers, engineers, computer scientists and business people graduated, and even our outstanding athletes historically attended.” PUSH provides scholarships to students attending HBCUs. She believes the threats seek to create fear and discourage Black students from organizing and mobilizing their voting power. “If these students on these campuses decide to register and vote where they attend school, they will change the character and culture of state legislatures that deny them reductions of student loan debt, changes in tuition and access to the ballot in those states. We will change the south, and therefore, change America,” she said. Johnson agrees, adding that the threats have only made his commitment to his students, and being part of the HBCU legacy, stronger. “I hope my generation has done the work to empower them, to let them know they’re supported,” he said.",News/World news,HBCU bomb threats: ‘I shouldn’t have to live in fear when I’m going to get an education’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/05/hbcu-bomb-threats-fear-education-hate-crimes
2/6/2022,"Hartlepool’s big day out may have ended in defeat but this was an occasion those who made the journey to south London will never forget. An inspired performance from Michael Olise that saw the Crystal Palace forward set up Marc Guéhi’s opening goal before coming up with a brilliant solo effort of his own proved enough to end the resistance of Graeme Lee’s brave side. Yet despite a convincing display from the hosts, it was still the 5,000 visiting supporters whose voices could be heard at the final whistle.  The presence of Olise and Eberechi Eze in the Palace starting lineup would be enough to give any defence a headache, and Hartlepool’s five-man defence must have known they were in for a long afternoon when the former glided past David Ferguson in the third minute before being brought down. Olise, the hero of Palace’s win over Millwall in the last round, picked himself up to deliver a pinpoint cross that Guéhi gleefully turned past Ben Killip. Conceding such an early goal was never likely to spoil the party in the away end. Having been on the brink of extinction in 2017 after being relegated to the National League, reaching this stage of the competition has capped a fairytale few months after they beat Torquay in the play-offs back in June. A flowing move almost straight after conceding that ended with right-back Jamie Sterry finding left-back Ferguson at the far post was an indication that Hartlepool were certainly not here to make up the numbers after dumping out Championship side Blackpool in the previous round. After his error against Millwall, Jack Butland looked relieved to see the ball spin behind the post when it slipped out of hands. Despite Hartlepool’s win over Palace in the third round when the two sides met in 1993, the hosts offered to subsidise coach travel for nearly 5,000 supporters who packed out the away end with their blue and white flags. Having paid just £12.50 for the 277-mile trip from the north-east, there seemed to have been plenty left over for refreshments as they roared their team forward. One passage of play involving a series of passes along the defensive line prompted an outbreak of Olés, although attempting to keep possession proved to be their downfall for Palace’s second goal. Joel Ward was quick to react to Killip’s goal kick and Conor Gallagher’s pass still gave Olise plenty to do. But after taking out Timi Odusina with a sublime first touch, the 20-year-old arrowed his finish into the corner for his fourth goal since joining from Reading in the summer. Palace have only reached the fifth round once since losing the final to Manchester United in dramatic circumstances in 2016, and look well equipped for another decent run this time around. They could have made certain of their progress early in the second half had one of Olise, Jean-Philippe Mateta or Jeffrey Schlupp found the net early in the second half, with Killip also responsible for keeping his side in it. An emergency in the away end that required medical staff from both clubs to sprint across the pitch caused a short delay as a supporter received treatment. Thankfully the players were able to resume around six minutes later. Hartlepool responded by creating their first opportunity for some time, only for Butland to deny Luke Molyneux. Had Sterry’s effort that whistled just past the Palace goalkeeper’s post with seven minutes still to play been on target, there could even have been a grandstand finish. Tayo Adaramola was also inches away from scoring, seconds after coming on for his debut on a day that he too will always remember.",Sport/Football,Guéhi and Olise push Crystal Palace past Hartlepool and their partying fans,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/crystal-palace-hartlepool-fa-cup-match-report
2/6/2022,"Ghislaine Maxwell’s legal arguments involving the juror who might not have disclosed childhood sexual abuse during jury selection should be public, prosecutors said in a letter Friday. “The government respectfully submits that the defendant has not justified her sealing request and, accordingly, the defense motion and its exhibits should be publicly docketed,” they told Manhattan federal court judge Alison Nathan.  A jury on 29 December found Maxwell guilty of sex trafficking and related counts for facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor girls, some as young as 14. Epstein, himself a convicted sex offender, was apprehended in July 2019 for sex trafficking teen girls; he killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell about one month later, while awaiting trial. Days after Maxwell was convicted, Juror 50, later identified as Scotty David, gave interviews where he publicly claimed to have been sexually abused as a child. David reportedly stated that he told other panelists about this abuse – helping them see things from a victim’s point of view. David’s statements about prior abuse spurred questions because potential jurors completed questionnaires as part of the selection process – which directly enquired about sexual abuse. One of these questions was: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” David reportedly maintained that he did not recall the question on abuse but stated he had answered every question honestly. Following David’s interviews, the prosecution asked Nathan to investigate his statements; Maxwell’s lawyers quickly requested a hearing and new trial. Maxwell’s team filed detailed arguments for a new trial under seal. They even filed their argument for sealing under wraps, but Nathan said on 26 January that it must be filed publicly. Maxwell’s lawyers did so on 1 February, saying that unsealing these detailed arguments “will provide a roadmap of the defense’s examination of Juror 50 and will allow him to plan out and tailor his responses, or even potentially spoliate evidence,” giving him an “improper preview” of their position. They also said that Maxwell “does not seek to seal the motion indefinitely” and “seeks only a temporary sealing to protect the integrity of any fact-finding process ordered by the court”. Prosecutors said Maxwell’s concerns about an “improper preview” were unfounded, contending that her arguments contain “some of the relevant case law and information about statements reportedly made by Juror 50 in the news media”. Maxwell’s lawyers could always redact sensitive material, they also noted. “There can be no need to hide from public view a discussion of public materials,” prosecutors said.",News/US news,"Ghislaine Maxwell retrial arguments must be public, prosecutors tell judge",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/05/ghislaine-maxwell-lawyers-retrial-prosecutors
2/6/2022,"Due to African Cup of Nations duty for Algeria, Riyad Mahrez was last sighted in Manchester City colours on New Year’s Day when he scored for a fourth consecutive game. Today, he extended the run, via two finishes in a second-half display that sparkled and which allowed City to kill off Fulham. Before the break this had been an invigorating clash between Pep Guardiola’s team, who top the Premier League, and Marco Silva’s Championship leaders. The latter scored first and though trailing at half-time they were barely behind in the possession percentages, in what had been a controlled display of passing reminiscent of their hosts.  Two years ago the score was 4-0 to City in the same fixture in the same round. Then, eight minutes were required for Bernardo Silva to start the festivities. Today Jack Grealish might have done the same 30 seconds in after Kevin De Bruyne slid the ball left and the No 10 advanced and shot – weakly – into Paulo Gazzaniga’s hands. This is what City do on a serial basis: start like hares whose speed dizzies and overruns the opponent. Yet Fulham did precisely the same moments later with an opener that exposed the vulnerability of Guardiola’s side to the counter. Harry Wilson launched a raid along Fulham’s right that took him in behind and with no defender nearby he could stroke over the ball for Fabio Carvalho to enjoy a tap-in, Kyle Walker and John Stones marooned on either side of the midfielder. Cut to a nonplussed Guardiola slumped in his seat. Then, cut back to the play as City equalised instantly. This had an air of pinball about it, as Phil Foden’s glide into Fulham’s area was followed by Grealish, Joâo Cancelo, and Mahrez all taking touches as possession ricocheted around before Ilkay Gündogan forced home. A frantic opening had a third goal in eight minutes when De Bruyne lifted in a corner from the left and Stones out-jumped Tim Ream to head home. If this was the order as might be expected restored, Silva’s unit did not fall into the role of upstarts reminded of their place. Instead, they played keep-ball, Ream, Joe Bryan, Nathaniel Chalobah and Tosin Adarabioyo all involved in one sequence as the west Londoners sought to construct from the back. The Cottagers composure was reflected in the possession count as the half hour passed. City were ahead, 52.4 to 47.6: a tiny margin considering their status as ball-retention experts supreme. Fulham’s passing could be as quick, too, as their hosts: Chalobah, Carvalho and Aleksandar Mitrovic combined in a rat-a-tat move that ended in the latter taking aim. The centre-forward missed but the visitors’ potency had Guardiola prowling the technical area. His team were in a contest, though the head still said that City might pull away, and, when Grealish, who switched from No 9 to wide left with Foden, danced into the area and let fly, before Cancelo also took aim as a long 45 minutes for Fulham began. Grealish’s twinkle-toes next claimed a penalty, his surge towards Gazzaniga’s goal too dangerous for Bryan to resist a challenge that scythed him down. Mahrez smacked the spot-kick in and City were in cruise-mode. Next, home smiles widened further when De Bruyne, in classic scheming fashion, raced onto a loose Harrison Reed pass, looked up and squared to Mahrez, whose finish made it 4-1. The Algerian was taken off around 13 minutes from the end, Guardiola greeting him with a warm hug. He deserved this – and the breather – as did City to progress to the fifth round. They have won the FA Cup once under Guardiola: this may be their year, again.",Sport/Football,Riyad Mahrez doubles up as Manchester City sweep Fulham aside in FA Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/manchester-city-fulham-fa-cup-match-report
2/6/2022,"Oil giants BP and Shell are on course to make a combined profit of almost £40bn this year from the rocketing price of petrol and gas, fuelling calls for a windfall tax on energy firms to ease the cost of living crisis. Before BP’s annual results this week, anti-poverty campaigners described the profits of oil producers as “obscene” and demanded the government take action to tax their surplus cash to support poorer families hit by rising energy bills.  MPs and unions said a large proportion of the industry’s profits were an unjustified windfall and the government should move quickly to impose a tax before the companies distribute them to shareholders. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change minister, said the oil and gas industry’s “booming” profits meant it was legitimate to impose a surcharge that would prevent millions of families from suffering hardship. A windfall tax is supported by the Tory MP and former energy minister Chris Skidmore, who called it “the right way to go”, and the TUC, which said it was needed to prevent the growth of food banks and the prospect of fuel poverty for millions of people. BP, which extracts oil in the North Sea, Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, is this week expected to announce annual pre-tax profits in 2021 of more than £12bn, before signalling that it is on course to make a £15.5bn profit in 2022. Last week Shell reported annual profits of £14.3bn, which analysts believe will grow to £23.6bn by the end of its financial year in June. A report for the left-of-centre thinktank Common Wealth found that Shell and BP have channelled £147bn to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks over the past decade, with rival North Sea producers and the big six energy suppliers contributing another £47bn. Last week the government announced a package of measures to offset rising energy bills, saying it would give all council taxpayers in England with band A to D homes a £150 rebate. It also said it would provide a £200 loan in October to be repaid in instalments over the next two years. The move followed a decision by the energy regulator Ofgem to increase the annual energy price cap by £693 to almost £2,000 a year, to allow suppliers to pass on the rising cost of gas and electricity. Oil and gas prices have surged since the global economy began to recover from the pandemic. Strong demand in Asia for gas and the row between Vladimir Putin and European leaders of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline have heightened fears of a global gas shortage. A cold winter in 2020 also depleted supplies, leaving stocks low as temperatures dropped in the northern hemisphere in 2021. Gas prices increased ninefold from a year earlier in the run-up to Christmas and remain five times higher than the level in January 2020. Oil prices have jumped from below $40 a barrel in the first lockdown to more than $80 a barrel. Several oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices continuing to rise above $100 a barrel this year, pushing oil company profits even higher. BP is expected to use its stronger cashflows to hand a larger dividend to shareholders and buyback shares to improve its value on the stock market. Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said in response to calls for a windfall tax: “I’m not convinced that windfall taxes, popular though as they seem, will help us with supply, nor is it going to help us with demand.” Shell said it was in dialogue with the British government to find ways to alleviate the energy crisis. Rishi Sunak rejected calls for a windfall tax last week, saying it would deny the sector the funds it needs in the switch to low-carbon sources of energy. The chancellor also said oil firms already contribute to the exchequer by paying a higher rate of corporation tax. Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said investments by BP and Shell in green technologies was “tiny” and only added to calls for them to face a higher tax rate. “It’s hard not to paint big energy companies as villains when they and their shareholders are profiting from the rising prices that are making life miserable for many hardworking people.” “Both businesses have made huge pledges but the proportion of spend they apportion to green projects is still woefully tiny. Such a gesture would take the sting out of their current good fortune, while benefiting both shareholders and the general public.” Tessa Khan, an international climate change and human rights lawyer and founder of campaign group Uplift, said it was “obscene” Shell’s shareholders were getting rich at a time when people face “real hardship”. “In 2020, not only did Shell not pay any tax in the UK, the only country in which it operates where it didn’t, Shell picked up nearly £100m from taxpayers in rebates. Yet, even now, the chancellor is refusing to step in and try and claw some back with a windfall tax.”",News/Business,£40bn profits for BP and Shell fuel calls for windfall tax on energy firms,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/05/40bn-profits-for-bp-and-shell-fuel-calls-for-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms
2/6/2022,"Despite all the carnage, leaks and resignation letters currently oozing out of No 10, Rishi Sunak somehow remains clean. Not popular exactly – not even that nice, given the soaring energy bills to come in the spring. Yet he’s still starchily authoritative, like a pharmacist. In the last two years, I’ve hoarded my Rishi rations (the pandemic self-employment grants the government gave qualifying freelancers) and pondered his lean, debt-assassin appeal. Every time I see him on TV I say out loud: “Rishi! You’re such a good boy! Yes – a GOOD BOY!” I convince myself he doesn’t want to be PM. I think he wants to be chancellor for ever. He literally just wants to do maths homework, all day, every day.  He married a billionaire because she’s into maths too – like, numbers with lots of zeros at the end – and maths is the glue that holds a relationship together. He will never cheat on you or, if he does, it’ll be with a very hi-tech calculator. No, what am I talking about? Rishi can do complex arithmetic in his head. At the risk of leaning into racial stereotypes, he is literally every boy I was at school with: clever, clean-cut, ambitious, on-message, well brought up, serious and nice. He also reminds me of every global one-percenter who ever messaged my rich, clever, petite, exotic, beautiful alpha friend Maya on Hinge: “Hi, I work in global cyber security, just spent three weeks talking corporate responsibility at a retreat in Mexico, really great conversations, looking good Maya, love the photos, let’s connect and find some synergy.” There’s been a huge rise in online agony aunts and advice columns during the pandemic, with the ace novelist Marian Keyes launching a new one this month with Tara Flynn called Now You’re Asking via podcast with the BBC. You can never have too much advice and I’ll add Marian’s to my current big fave, Philippa Perry’s column in the Observer. The classics of course were the American columnists E Jean Carroll and Irma Kurtz, who will always be the best, while my saltier formative Gen X voices of guidance were the brilliant Karen Krizanovich in Sky magazine in the 90s and the Mrs Mills etiquette column in the Times. I was recently invited to audition as a potential agony aunt. I pitched the idea of Aunt Agony, the best kind of aunt being a spinster who has no nieces or nephews, serves her tea hot and her praise lukewarm, works a nice line in funky earrings and jazzy tops, delivers realtalk with a hint of menace and whose every answer, to every question, is: “He’s trash, they’re all trash, it’s nothing to do with you, drop it and run like hell.” I’m appalled that there’s a new bestseller out called The Power of Fun, along with a whole movement based on the idea of a “funtervention”. Yes, like an intervention for an addict: an unpleasant and humiliating sudden ambush by your nearest and dearest, who confront you with your misery addiction. Can we please drop the idea that happiness is a human right? Why do we have to enjoy ourselves all the time doing banal activities such as taking deep breaths and doing things for other people? We’re two-thirds of the way into a pandemic and we’re supposed to be trying to be happy? We should all just praise the gods that we’re not dead.

2/6/2022,"The Trojan Horse Affair | Serial Productions/New York Times Fake Psychic | BBC Sounds  I, An Actor, a Podcast | Acast The last time most of us heard a podcast series from reporter Brian Reed, he was working his diffident, determined way around the life of Alabama horologist John B McLemore for the fantastic, award-winning S-Town. Now he’s back, alongside rookie journalist Hamza Syed, unpicking … the education of children in Birmingham schools. That’s Birmingham, UK, by the way. Syed is from there. An ex-doctor turned investigative reporter, in 2018 he approached Reed with an idea. Syed’s very first investigation: The Trojan Horse Affair. For those who don’t remember, here’s a recap. In 2014, the then education secretary Michael Gove commissioned a report from a counter-terrorism expert into a few Birmingham schools with majority Muslim pupils. He wanted to know whether the heads and governors were “radicalising” the pupils by introducing extreme Islamic ideas. As a result of the report, teachers and governors were sacked and previously outstanding schools were taken into special measures. Citizenship lessons were inserted into the national curriculum, and the still controversial inform-on-a-potential-terrorist Prevent programme was created. The whole affair had huge ramifications, especially for young Muslims. The trigger for the whole hoo-ha was an anonymous letter, sent to Birmingham council, which detailed the supposed methods that the supposed radicalisers were using for “Operation Trojan Horse”. Step one: get on to the governors’ board – that sort of thing. Though it seemed to be well informed, many people now assume that the letter was bogus. Syed had one question: who wrote it? A simple question. Always the best way to start a journalistic journey. And surely Serial Productions, the non plus ultra of podcast brands, will deliver a revelatory, gripping listen. Well yes, sort of. Here are the positives. Novice Syed – emotional, funny, articulate – is an immensely charismatic presenter and brilliant on what the Trojan Horse affair has meant to Muslims who want to succeed in the UK without disavowing their cultural backgrounds. Reed, great as usual, balances precise, truthful reporting with personal, funny asides. Plus, the pair do appear to discover who wrote the letter and why. Their pursuit of truth leads them to local government, to national government, back to schools and, eventually, to Australia (Serial clearly has a bigger budget than most podcasts). But. This series is loooong, about eight hours over eight episodes. It’s also frustrating. Perhaps this isn’t a surprise. Anyone who has tried to deal with local councils, even in just a “why is this bill so high and what is it for?” capacity, knows how hard it is to pin down anyone to accept responsibility for anything. So to discover, say, who was in a particular meeting, and what was said, takes endless hours and mammoth patience. With this story, the shutters come down very swiftly from anyone official and, despite freedom-of-information requests, many stay down. The final episode involves a dentist, Achmad Da Costa, who, for various reasons, also wants the Trojan Horse to be properly exposed. Da Costa has several words of wisdom, including “on the side of truth is time”. Perhaps he’s right, though whether the truth will bring consequences is quite another thing. The British establishment has a habit of mischaracterising those it deems to be outsiders, whether Irish Catholics, working-class football supporters, the Windrush generation or Muslim youth. It also has a habit of suppressing its own past misdemeanours, as all those communities know. Often, it takes years for the truth to be revealed, and even longer for any consequences. I hope that something concrete will come from this dogged podcast, but I won’t be holding my breath. Another podcast that lands with the weight of its maker’s previous success is Fake Psychic. From journalist Vicky Baker, who made Fake Heiress, about Anna Delvey, this new series is funny, both ha ha and peculiar. It’s a detailed retelling of another fraudster’s life: that of M Lamar Keene, a US psychic who wrote a book about how he and other mediums used to trick their audiences. As it’s a BBC podcast, there are drama inserts (I wonder when this awful trend will stop?), but these are saved by the fabulously outre performance of Edward Hogg as Lamar. The problem with Fake Psychic is that it’s quite interesting but not madly. A four-parter, rather than a six-parter. Still, it’s frothy enough, and there’s weirdness here too. Did you know that even today, the US has several spiritualist camps, like spooky Butlin’s, where the public pay and psychics commune with their dead relatives? Such camps are regarded as religious! And more silliness from good old Nigel Planer, who has revisited Nicholas Craig, the exquisitely observed pompous old thesp of his book I, An Actor. His new show, I, An Actor, a Podcast, is yet more harrumphing about other actors’ careers, plus ego-driven daftery, and I am enjoying it greatly.",Arts/Television & radio,"The week in audio: The Trojan Horse Affair; Fake Psychic; I, An Actor, a Podcast",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/05/the-trojan-horse-affair-podcast-brian-reed-review-serial-fake-psychic-i-an-actor-nigel-planer-nicholas-craig
2/6/2022,"Quite a few people thought Ireland would beat champions Wales. They were wrong. Ireland absolutely obliterated them. But even that is not quite right. What makes this win so impressive was the dexterity of it, the effortless command of fingers and angles, which made us almost not notice the physicality of which they have long been purveyors. If 29-7 does not sound quite an obliteration, the truth is that 50 points would have not flattered the Irish. Four tries, though, three of them scored in the third quarter, represent a full house of points, so “job done”, that old catchphrase of champions, applies here regardless. If Ireland were not favourites for the title, they could not have done much more for their prospects than dismantle the champions like this. Wales are used to being underrated despite a record this century better than anyone’s, but they are without a host of points of reference. It showed. They looked lost by the end. They were not the only ones at the start.  This is a familiar Ireland team, all the more so given 11 of them play for the same province, but here they launched a new star from the west. Even connoisseurs of rugby outside Galway would be forgiven for needing to read up about Mack Hansen this week. The Aussie-born son of an Irish mother pitched up a few months ago to honour his new contract with Connacht, and here he became a fully fledged Ireland international. A minute in, he was away down the left as if he had played with this crack outfit for years. Ireland could not quite finish his chip and chase, but they scored from the line-out anyway. The try was scored by Bundee Aki, who finished after a perfect cut-out pass by, well, this bloke Hansen again, but the blur of hands and bristling muscles in the build-up were multiple. Ireland have long favoured what is known as the Sexton loop, Johnny loving the licence to lurk behind the front line and pick his moment, but now any number of players are given licence to spring each other through gaps. Tadhg Furlong, for example, is a tighthead prop. At one point he put Sexton through a gap with the deftness of a man half his size. It is difficult to overstate the absurdity of the mere idea of a tighthead doing things like that last century. Do not go thinking he was shirking his other duties either. The man scrummaged and bulldozed as much as ever. But let us not pick on Furlong. Ireland, all of them, were a blur of moving parts. If Josh Adams had hoped for a loosener for his first match in that most demanding of roles in the outside centre, he was not to be obliged. Wales, though, rolled with the punches, their light but oh-so-hard back row to the fore, just enough to spike Ireland’s guns at the point of execution on more than a few occasions. Such is Wales’s list of absentees, damage limitation was a respectable ambition against Ireland in this mood. Sexton scuffed his first two penalties at goal but landed a third. Rarely has a fly-half booted the ball off for half-time with more enthusiasm than Dan Biggar did. A 10-0 deficit felt a steal. That impression only deepened after the break. A good team makes their dominance tell where it counts. Turns out Ireland are a good team. Again, they came out of the blocks at high speed; again they scored early, but this time thrice. The first two were finished by Andrew Conway. His finish of the first was remarkable, an outstretched arm somehow reaching the line, the second formulaic, but the approach play to both was considered and bewitching, featuring virtually everyone. There was Furlong as the pivot, twice in the build-up to Conway’s second. Conway might have had a third-quarter hat-trick, but the imperious Garry Ringrose chose to go himself, this time after some improvisational counterattacking featuring the loosehead prop, Andrew Porter, and winger Hansen. Ireland were painfully dominant - and now, 29-0 up on the hour, every stat attested to that reality. Easier to eulogise Ireland; not so easy to find anything positive for Wales.Taine Basham’s growing reputation was sort of enhanced in adversity. His intercept try with five minutes to go was the ugliest try of the day, but reward the flanker was well worth. Adams had his moment in attack in the first half, albeit down the wing, but his yellow card for a weird body check on Sexton helped those bewitching runners score Ireland’s third. No, this was Ireland’s day, a marker laid down every bit as persuasive as their victory over the All Blacks in November. Now they go to Paris, home of the official favourites. They also beat the All Blacks in the autumn.
