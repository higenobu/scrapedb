3/28/2022,"By turning up to the 2022 Oscars sans-shirt, Timothée Chalamet gave the red carpet its biggest fashion moment. Not since Jennifer Lopez wore that Versace dress to the Grammys has bare décolletage warranted so much discussion. The look attracted everything from breathless devotion to derision and (accurate) comparisons to the L Word character Shane McCutcheon. However, it cannot be chalked up as a win for menswear, since the actor’s cropped jacket, overlaid with shiny lace, was from Louis Vuitton’s 2022 spring womenswear collection. men should apologize for not being timothée chalamet #oscar pic.twitter.com/9OgVQuM2Vk kristen stewart and timothee competing for Best Shane McCutcheon This is all of your faults https://t.co/DwnFwtpt6R The similarity between Chalamet and best actress nominee Kristen Stewart – who wore a shirt, but barely – was also difficult to miss. In my opinion they will switch outfits mid-ceremony pic.twitter.com/5836xw2nLv Chalamet’s chest was not entirely bare – he did have a large, diamond-encrusted panther head dangling against it. In this respect, his look shared something with the far more tightly buttoned, powder blue outfit worn by Australian best supporting actor nominee Kodi Smit-McPhee, who wore a diamond-encrusted choker in place of a tie. I kind of don't hate it. It doesn't hurt that Kodi Smit-McPhee is built like an armature and has the vibe of a gentle alien who came to earth to go to art school. pic.twitter.com/5wjF3TxtrP All three outfits, alongside Wesley Snipes’ almost-medieval satin shorts, reflected a broader turn towards gender-neutral red carpet fashion. But all it really takes to make a suit stand out is to pick one in a colour other than black, which is exactly what Simu Liu, Diane Warren and Scott Evans did. good evening to simu liu’s tailor only pic.twitter.com/y7v0viqVLJ The alternative – going all black including the shirt – may have been popular among attendees but did not seem quite as daring to observers. the amount of black shirts with black tuxedos ... pic.twitter.com/9HhyWqu6WL Meanwhile, the white shirt’s greatest defender wore hers with a sparkling skirt. zendaya is breathtakingly gorgeous, wow pic.twitter.com/qVKfhdoxLj",Arts/Film,Chest in show: Timothée Chalamet gives 2022’s Oscar red carpet its biggest fashion moment,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/chest-in-show-timothee-chalamet-gives-2022s-oscar-red-carpet-its-biggest-fashion-moment
3/28/2022,"One week into its invasion of Ukraine, Russia massed a 40-mile mechanised column in order to mount an overwhelming attack on Kyiv from the north. But the convoy of armoured vehicles and supply trucks ground to a halt within days, and the offensive failed, in significant part because of a series of night ambushes carried out by a team of 30 Ukrainian special forces and drone operators on quad bikes, according to a Ukrainian commander. The drone operators were drawn from an air reconnaissance unit, Aerorozvidka, which began eight years ago as a group of volunteer IT specialists and hobbyists designing their own machines and has evolved into an essential element in Ukraine’s successful David-and-Goliath resistance. However, while Ukraine’s western backers have supplied thousands of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles and other military equipment, Aerorozvidka has been forced to resort to crowdfunding and a network of personal contacts in order to keep going, by getting hold of components such as advanced modems and thermal imaging cameras, in the face of export controls that prohibit them being sent to Ukraine. The unit’s commander, Lt Col Yaroslav Honchar, gave an account of the ambush near the town of Ivankiv that helped stop the vast, lumbering Russian offensive in its tracks. He said the Ukrainian fighters on quad bikes were able to approach the advancing Russian column at night by riding through the forest on either side of the road leading south towards Kyiv from the direction of Chernobyl. The Ukrainian soldiers were equipped with night vision goggles, sniper rifles, remotely detonated mines, drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras and others capable of dropping small 1.5kg bombs. “This one little unit in the night destroyed two or three vehicles at the head of this convoy, and after that it was stuck. They stayed there two more nights, and [destroyed] many vehicles,” Honchar said. The Russians broke the column into smaller units to try to make headway towards the Ukrainian capital, but the same assault team was able to mount an attack on its supply depot, he claimed, crippling the Russians’ capacity to advance. “The first echelon of the Russian force was stuck without heat, without oil, without bombs and without gas. And it all happened because of the work of 30 people,” Honchar said. The Aerorozvidka unit also claims to have helped defeat a Russian airborne attack on Hostomel airport, just north-west of Kyiv, in the first day of the war, using drones to locate, target and shell about 200 Russian paratroopers concealed at one end of the airfield. “That contributed largely to the fact that they could not use this airfield for further development of their attack,” Lt Taras, one of Honchar’s aides, said. Not all the details of these claims could be independently verified, but US defence officials have said that Ukrainian attacks contributed to the halting of the armoured column around Ivankiv. The huge amount of aerial combat footage published by the Ukrainians underlines the importance of drones to their resistance. The unit was started by young university-educated Ukrainians who had been part of the 2014 Maidan uprising and volunteered to use their technical skills in the resistance against the first Russian invasion in Crimea and the Donbas region. Its founder, Volodymyr Kochetkov-Sukach, was an investment banker who was killed in action in 2015 in Donbas – a reminder of the high risks involved. The Russians can latch on to the drone’s electronic signature and quickly strike with mortars, so the Aerorozvidka teams have to launch and run. Honchar is an ex-soldier turned IT marketing consultant, who returned to the army after the first Russian invasion. Taras was a management consultant, who specialised in fundraising for the unit and only joined full-time as a combatant in February. In its early days, the unit used commercial surveillance drones, but its team of engineers, software designers and drone enthusiasts later developed their own designs. They built a range of surveillance drones, as well as large 1.5-metre eight-rotor machines capable of dropping bombs and rocket-propelled anti-tank grenades, and created a system called Delta, a network of sensors along the frontlines that fed into a digital map so commanders could see enemy movements as they happened. It now uses the Starlink satellite system, supplied by Elon Musk, to feed live data to Ukrainian artillery units, allowing them to zero in on Russian targets. The unit was disbanded in 2019 by the then defence minister, but it was hastily revived in October last year as the Russian invasion threat loomed. The ability to maintain an aerial view of Russian movements has been critical to the success of Ukraine’s guerrilla-style tactics. But Aerorozvidka’s efforts to expand, and to replace lost equipment, have been hindered by a limited supply of drones and components, and efforts to secure them through defence ministry procurement have produced little, partly because they are a recent addition to the armed forces and still considered outsiders. Furthermore, some of the advanced modems and thermal-imaging cameras made in the US and Canada are subject to export controls, so they have resorted to crowdfunding and asking a global network of friends and supporters to find them on eBay or other websites. Marina Borozna, who was an economics student at university with Taras, is exploring ways of buying what the unit needs and finding routes to get the supplies across the border. “I know there are people who want to help them fight, people who want to do a bit more than the humanitarian aid,” Borozna said. “If you want to address the root cause of this human suffering, you’ve got to defeat the Russian invasion. Aerorozvidka makes a huge difference and they need our support.” Her partner, Klaus Hentrich, a molecular biologist in Cambridge, is also helping the effort, drawing on his experience as a conscript in the German army. “I was in an artillery reconnaissance unit myself, so I immediately realised the outsized impact that Aerorozvidka has. They effectively give eyes to their artillery,” Hentrich said. “Where we can make a difference is to rally international support, be it financial contributions, help to get harder-to-find technical components or donations of common civilian drones.” The unit is also looking at ways to overcome Russian jamming, part of the electronic warfare being waged in Ukraine in parallel to the bombs, shells and missiles. At present, Aerorozvidka typically waits for the Russians turn off their jamming equipment to launch their own drones, and then it sends up its machines at the same time. The unit then concentrates its firepower on the electronic warfare vehicles. Honchar describes these technological battles, and Aerorozvidka’s way of fighting, as the future of warfare, in which swarms of small teams networked together by mutual trust and advanced communications can overwhelm a bigger and more heavily armed adversary. “We are like a hive of bees,” he said. “One bee is nothing, but if you are faced with a thousand, it can defeat a big force. We are like bees, but we work at night.”",News/World news,The drone operators who halted Russian convoy headed for Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/the-drone-operators-who-halted-the-russian-armoured-vehicles-heading-for-kyiv
3/28/2022,"Coda has been named this year’s best picture at an Oscars ceremony that featured an unusual confrontation between Will Smith and Chris Rock. The Apple TV+ drama, bought from 2021’s Sundance film festival for a record-breaking $25m, became the first film from a streamer to win the award. It’s a remake of French film La Famille Bélier, focusing on the only hearing member of a deaf family. “Thank you to the Academy for letting us make history,” said producer Philippe Rousselet. Producer Patrick Wachsberger thanked the Academy for “recognising a movie of love and family in this difficult time”. Troy Kotsur also won best supporting actor for his role in the film, making him the second deaf actor to bring home an Oscar, joining his co-star Marlee Matlin who won for Children of a Lesser God in 1987. “I really want to thank all of the wonderful deaf theatre stages where I was allowed and given the opportunity to develop my craft as an actor,” he said in an emotive speech. “This is dedicated to the deaf community, the Coda community and the disabled community. This is our moment.” Sian Heder, Coda’s writer-director, also won best adapted screenplay becoming the first woman to bring home the award by herself since Emma Thompson in 1995. Coda has become the first best picture winner with less than four nominations since 1932’s Grand Hotel. Will Smith had the night’s most viral moment with Chris Rock after the comedian made a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith’s shaved head, saying he was looking forward to GI Jane 2. Pinkett Smith, who revealed last year that she has alopecia, was unamused and an angered Smith then came on to the stage and appeared to slap Rock before the sound muted and footage later showed that Rock said “Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me” before Smith shouted: “Get my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth.” Rock tried to defuse the situation by saying it “was a GI Jane joke” before Smith repeated his warning. Scott Feinberg of the Hollywood Reporter tweeted that Smith was then calmed by Denzel Washington and Tyler Perry during the commercial break as he appeared to wipe tears from his eyes. Smith later secured his first Oscar, winning best actor for playing the father of Venus and Serena Williams in King Richard. “Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family,” he said tearfully. “I know to do what we do, you gotta be able to take abuse, you gotta be able to take people talk crazy about you, in this business, you gotta have people disrespecting you and you gotta smile and pretend that it’s okay.” He then recalled advice just given to him by fellow nominee Washington: “At your highest moment, be careful that’s when the devil comes for you.” He continued: “I wanna apologise to the Academy, I wanna apologise to all my fellow nominees … art imitates life. I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams, but love will make you do crazy things.” “Will Smith said it all, let’s have peace and love and quiet,” Anthony Hopkins said later onstage. The award for best director went to Jane Campion for queer psychodrama The Power of the Dog, the only win for a film that had led the pack with the most nominations. Campion is only the third female director to ever win the Oscar for best director, following in the footsteps of Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker and Chloé Zhao last year for Nomadland. She thanked the film’s “actors I’m moved to call my friends” and called the win “a lifetime honour”. Jessica Chastain was named best actress for televangelist biopic The Eyes of Tammy Faye, her third nomination and first win. The actor spoke of recent times of “trauma and isolation” and how suicide has affected many, including herself. She paid tribute to LGBTQ+ youth who “feel out of place with their peers” and face “discriminatory and bigoted legislation that is sweeping our country”. “At times like this I’m reminded of Tammy,” she said and her “radical acts of love”. She said to all those feeling alone: “I just want you to know that you are unconditionally loved for the uniqueness that is you.” The film also won the only other award it was nominated for, best hair and makeup. Ariana DeBose was named best supporting actress for her performance in Steven Spielberg’s remake of West Side Story. She became the first openly queer woman of colour and only the second Latina to ever win an Oscar. She joins her West Side Story co-star Rita Moreno, who also won for playing the character of Anita in 1962. “For anyone who has ever questioned your identity … there is indeed a place for us,” DeBose said while paying tribute to Moreno as a “divine inspiration who paved the way for tons of Anitas”. Kenneth Branagh picked up best original screenplay for his semi-autobiographical drama Belfast. “It’s a great tribute to an amazing city,” he said of the award, his first win from eight nominations. There was outcry last month when it was announced that eight craft awards would be announced before the ceremony and then edited into the broadcast later. These were dominated by Dune, which won for Hans Zimmer’s original score as well as for editing, sound and production design. The film later won cinematography and visual effects too, making it the night’s most awarded with six wins. Drive My Car, which was the first Japanese film nominated for best picture, was named best international feature film. Encanto beat out competition from Flee and The Mitchells vs the Machines to win best animated film. Questlove’s Summer of Soul was named best documentary. This year also saw the introduction of two Twitter-voted special awards for fans. The fan favourite film was won by Zack Snyder’s Netflix zombie thriller Army of the Dead while the all-time most cheer-worthy moment was won by Zack Snyder’s Justice League for the scene where Ezra Miller’s The Flash enters speed force. Last year’s best actor nominee Riz Ahmed also became the first Muslim and first person of Asian descent to win live action short for The Long Goodbye. “This is for everyone who feels like they don’t belong,” he said in his speech. “Anyone who feels like they’re stuck in no man’s land. You’re not alone.” British two-time Oscar-winner Jenny Beavan also won for her costume work on Cruella. The ceremony was hosted by Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes. “We’re gonna have a great night tonight and for you people in Florida, we’re gonna have a gay night tonight,” said Sykes to applause, in reference to the state’s controversial “don’t say gay” bill which seeks to ban teaching of sexual identity and gender orientation in early-grade education as well as in “a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students”. Sykes also made a jab at voter suppression by presenting a shredded Texas voter registration form. The night was kicked off with an extravagant performance by Beyoncé, singing her Oscar-nominated song from King Richard in the tennis courts of Compton. But the award for best original song went to Billie Eilish and her brother, Finneas, for their Bond song No Time to Die. The ceremony was also by the war in Ukraine with stars including Jason Mamoa, Jamie Lee Curtis, Benedict Cumberbatch and Samuel L Jackson all wearing ribbons or badges. “To see children buried under the rubble of theaters, to see pregnant women being injured in maternity wards, I just, you know, it beggars belief that it is happening,” Cumberbatch said on the red carpet. “One cannot help but be in awe of those who find strength to keep fighting in unimaginable darkness,” the Ukrainian-born Mila Kunis said in her introduction to a performance by Reba McEntire. It was then followed by messaging that asked for a moment of silence and a plea for help. “We ask you to support Ukraine in any way that you are able,” the screen read. Schumer had previously expressed a desire for the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to appear while Sean Penn said he would smelt his Oscars if this didn’t happen. Sykes was asked about this idea on the red carpet. “You know, in Hollywood, we can get a little full of ourselves and we think that what we’re doing is all so important,” she said to Variety. “I understand that, yeah, what we do reaches a lot people and we can persuade a lot of people, but it’s also [respectful] to just know your lane. You know what I’m saying? Know your lane.” Schumer did use a moment near the end of the night to improvise a reminder that there is “a genocide going on in Ukraine and women are losing all their rights ... and trans people”. Last year’s Academy awards were led by wins for Nomadland and its director, Zhao, and star, Frances McDormand.
