12/27/2021,"Police have formally apologised to the family of the former footballer Dalian Atkinson after an officer who kicked and fired an electric stun gun at him was convicted over his death, the Guardian has learned. In June PC Benjamin Monk, of the West Mercia force, became the first officer in more than three decades to be convicted of manslaughter during the course of his duties.  The jury heard that he fired a stun gun into Atkinson for 33 seconds – six times longer than is standard – and then kicked him twice in the head, leaving a boot imprint on his forehead and blood on the officer’s laces. Police had been called in August 2016 to an early morning disturbance as Atkinson had a mental health crisis in the street outside his father’s house in Telford, Shropshire. Some, including the Atkinson family, see the case as a British version of the US police killing of George Floyd. The family say the apology after five years was overdue. A new chief constable, Pippa Mills, took over the West Mercia force in September. In her letter of apology, Mills wrote: “A police uniform does not grant officers immunity to behave unlawfully or to abuse their powers. Ben Monk’s conduct was in direct contradiction to the standards and behaviour of the policing service, and understandably undermined public confidence.” The letter accepts that Monk used unreasonable force, with the kicks to Atkinson’s head contributing to his death. It also accepts that Atkinson’s right to life, protected under the European convention on human rights, was breached. Mills acknowledged that the death was “devastating” for the family, and added: “I cannot imagine the immense pain you have felt and how the significant delays with the trial have also added to your burden of grief. You have demonstrated great strength and dignity throughout the past five years.” The letter followed negotiations between the family’s lawyers and police solicitors, with one area of contention being compensation after the guilty verdict. The chief constable pledged to learn lessons from the death, and ended by saying: “I am deeply sorry for the devastating impact the actions of a West Mercia officer has caused you and I extend my deepest condolences.” The letter makes no mention of whether Monk should have been an officer at the time. During his sentencing, it emerged that Monk had been found guilty by a police discipline tribunal of gross misconduct in 2010, but had been allowed to stay in the force. After his manslaughter conviction and eight-year jail sentence, Monk, 43, was dismissed from the force. Kate Maynard, the solicitor for Atkinson’s family, said: “Over five years after Dalian Atkinson died of horrific injuries caused by a serving police officer, this official apology to the family is welcomed and overdue. “The chief constable’s acknowledgment that a police uniform does not grant immunity is especially pertinent in a year that has seen other terrible examples of deadly police violence. It is hoped that this will serve as a deterrent, and also embolden those who seek police accountability.” West Mercia police declined to comment.",News/UK news,Police formally apologise over Dalian Atkinson death after officer’s conviction ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/26/police-formally-apologise-over-dalian-atkinson-death-after-officers-conviction
12/27/2021,"My entire experience of Auckland changed when I got a boat. It was the perfect antidote to a professional DJ lifestyle, where getting up at 5am to be on the water become immeasurably preferable to coming home at 5am from work. On trips out I began sticking my head underwater with such vigour that I somehow turned it into a whole new profession. It didn’t happen straight away, of course. My 40-year-old, 14-foot beige fibreglass boat with a semi-reliable two-stroke engine, named Brown Thunder, only had so much range, and my real goal lay much farther offshore, tantalisingly out of reach. A place where tales of clear blue tropical water and huge fish swirled around a group of uninhabited islands, teasing me from the pages of marine magazines or the crusty lips of old salty sea-mates.  I don’t mind sharing the Mokohinau Islands with you because getting to them is not an easy trip. They’re just shy of 40km out to sea, with no shelter in between, with calm weather windows fleeting. A bit of wind against tide can quickly make an uncomfortable trip turn dangerous. Of course, this only adds to the intrigue. From launch the islands aren’t visible but trusting a compass bearing the horizon gradually throws up a lump of land that splits into three on approach. It’s precisely this remoteness that makes the islands so special to me. The Auckland isthmus is lapped by different oceans. On the Pacific side, the Hauraki Gulf is described as the city’s jewel in the crown. It’s an expanse of water filled with more than 50 islands and an incredible diversity of life. More than 20% of all the world’s seabirds can be found here; five of these birds breed no where else on Earth. And out along one boundary lies the Mokohinau Islands, the location a true convergence zone where the rich gulf waters merge with a distinct eastern current. In summer this warm conveyor belt brings a stunning range of tropical visitors. I have found myself in the water here with tuna, marlin, mako sharks, bronze whalers, manta rays, sunfish, false killer whales, real killer whales, pilot whales and even a massive spine-tailed devil ray. As an active freediver I have been humbled in huge vortex clouds of blue mao mao, giant schools of trevally, acres of kahawai and, of course, New Zealand’s legendary monster yellowtail kingfish. They are an internationally renowned sportfish and New Zealand happens to hold 23 of the 24 world records relating to them. I was even lucky enough to once win the national Kingfish Cup, spearing a specimen of 34kg – all at this magical place fishers affectionately call “the Mokes” but I like to refer to as Jurassic Park. The rock formations that rise out of the water differ to the mainland so much that visitors I bring here describe it feeling more like Thailand than Aotearoa. On the right tide I can fit my boat through an archway into a lagoon in the middle of one island, half expecting Leonardo DiCaprio to leap out and stab a shark, à la The Beach. The islands weren’t always uninhabited: alongside their rich Māori history it’s still possible to go ashore and view a once-occupied lighthouse with a troubled past. One lighthouse keeper ran out of food so attached urgent notes to a model boat he made from tin and aimed for the coast. Miraculously, supplies were sent out just nine days later. Another keeper wasn’t so lucky and the extreme isolation drove him to take his own life. My journey to these islands also changed me in ways I couldn’t have imagined. I had been saving for a house deposit but when my very good friend’s breast cancer got the better of her I decided to live in the moment as she had so valiantly, and spent my savings on a bigger boat. While not a financially astute action I finally had the ability to get to the Mokes, and I honoured this impulse by naming my boat after her. The first trips were everything I had hoped for and I started to make videos of the experience because I wanted to show others the unseen magic we have on our doorstep. This led directly to me developing my own television fishing/travel series now five seasons deep and playing in more than 85 countries as a National Geographic title. It developed in me a strong belief in finding ways to connect people to the ocean, to give them a reason to care about what’s going on in and around it. I owe those islands for opening this whole new chapter and helping me discover in myself the things that are truly important in life.

12/27/2021,"One touch took Aymeric Laporte out of the game, sending him sliding into no-man’s land. A second took James Maddison past Rúben Dias, last season’s Footballer of the Year, with conspicuous ease. Then came an exchange of passes with Kelechi Iheanacho and an assured finish. Then there was the weaving run that took him past a series of defenders before Iheanacho released Ademola Lookman to score Leicester’s second goal. Then came his second long-range shot, whipped with menace, that Ederson tipped on to the bar. This one fell obligingly for Iheanacho to tap in the rebound. In 10 minutes, Maddison had conjured a comeback out of nothing. For nothing, too: Leicester’s three-goal salvo may have inspired Manchester City to score two more. But it was a virtuoso display of quality, showcasing a flair player’s full armoury: shooting from distance, mesmeric dribbling, delicate touches and incisive passes.  A venue where City win so often and by such margins lends itself more to doomed heroics by goalkeepers than attacking midfielders. Perhaps not since Kevin De Bruyne’s Gerrard-esque tour de force when Tottenham controversially eliminated City from the 2019 Champions League has one done so much in vain. Until yesterday, Conor Gallagher may have produced the finest performance by a visiting player at the Etihad this season. Then Maddison proved a point while earning Leicester none. While a porous defence sieved six, he opened up the league leaders at will. As Leicester’s fortunes have got worse, his have improved. Their December has bordered on the disastrous at times. They have exited the Europa League and the Carabao Cup, entered the Europa Conference League, despite Brendan Rodgers claiming he did not know what it is, lost a host of players and all realistic chance of Champions League football. A club who spent 567 days in the top four in the last two seasons, albeit without finishing there, are now 13 points behind fourth-placed Arsenal. But in the last five weeks, Maddison has mustered six goals and five assists. From the mediocrity of a largely barren 2021, he has rediscovered magnificence. He has been the forgotten man of England’s raft of creators, rarely even mentioned in dispatches by Gareth Southgate now. His friend Jack Grealish became the £100m man. But Grealish, paying the price for a night out, went unused, a spectator as Maddison outshone even De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gündogan, terrifically as each played. Perhaps he had justified Pep Guardiola’s pre-match assessment. The City manager’s praise can be football’s deadliest weapon and, when he called Leicester “exceptional” this week, it threatened to be a savage sequel. Marcelo Bielsa, the man Guardiola has deemed the best manager in the world, lost 7-0 here. Leicester were four down after 25 minutes. Fifteen months after Leicester’s 5-2 demolition of City, four after they won the Community Shield, came perhaps Rodgers’s worst first half since Liverpool traipsed in 5-0 down to Stoke in Steven Gerrard’s final game. But Leicester had the quality and wherewithal to come back from the brink of humiliation. They nevertheless departed with a worse defensive record this season than Watford. Circumstances contribute, injuries occurred at the wrong time but perhaps the weakest rearguard Rodgers has fielded were eviscerated, confused and confounded, compounding their problems by conceding penalties. Without five sidelined defenders, including their three best centre-backs, he also deemed Wilfred Ndidi unfit to feature. Leicester’s makeshift back four consisted of a midfielder (Marc Albrighton), an odd-job man (Daniel Amartey), a bad signing (Jannik Vestergaard), and a 20-year-old (Luke Thomas). It was a recipe for goals. Guardiola bemused them by giving them no one to mark. City’s formation consisted of a back four, a holding midfielder, three attacking midfielders and two high, wide wingers. Amartey and Vestergaard stood horribly exposed, knowing the enemy was coming, but not who or when or how as a rotating cast of elusive technicians suddenly materialised. City demonstrated the depth of their talent. Fernandinho became the 14th Manchester City player to assist a goal in the this season. Often the creator in chief, De Bruyne is not on that list, but he is one of eight to have been varying types of false – or occasionally genuine – nines. A match of a solitary defensive midfielder – the pensionable Fernandinho – was made for their attacking counterparts in both teams. And then Leicester rendered Maddison’s efforts irrelevant with the most mundane of failings. They conceded twice from corners. The prospect of perhaps the greatest Premier League comeback disappeared but memories of Maddison’s brilliance should remain.",Sport/Football,James Maddison puts in performance for the ages despite Leicester’s defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/26/james-maddison-puts-in-performance-for-the-ages-despite-leicesters-defeat
12/27/2021,"“For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me” – Gospel of Matthew 25:35. “One girl who had suffered fuel burns on the boat as she travelled across the Channel was neglected for two days, leaving her with scars for life, it was found” – Guardian report on the treatment of detained asylum seekers in Kent, 16 December.  For Christians, the Christmas narrative offers an annual reminder of the ethical duty to offer hospitality to the stranger. The straitened circumstances of the birth of Jesus in a Bethlehem stable, and the holy family’s subsequent flight from Herod into Egypt, both identify Christ with the predicament of all who are vulnerable, exiled and in need. For non-believers – most of us these days – there is always the reference point of international law. Two thousand years after Jesus lived, the Judeo-Christian commitment to the outsider – to what the Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas called the face of the other “in its nudity and defencelessness” – found legal expression in the form of the refugee convention of 1951. Sadly, in increasingly insular, inward-looking times, faith in that seems to be dwindling too. The convention became an integral part of the postwar era, originally offering rights of asylum to millions of displaced people in Europe. The horrors of totalitarianism, two world wars and the Holocaust irrevocably shaped the hearts and minds of those who lived through them and sought to learn from the experience. The right to seek and be given refuge in a safe country formed part of a new liberal architecture of universal rights. But 70 years on, proliferating barriers and fences along European borders testify to a harsher mood. As a notion of “Fortress Europe” is normalised, the inviolable right to claim asylum – to make one’s case and be properly heard – is no longer uncontested. The direction of travel became starkly apparent during the recent crisis on Poland’s eastern border with Belarus, when thousands of migrants from the Middle East were repelled with water cannon and batons. Forced to freeze in a small strip of wooded no man’s land, at least 21 people died. Hundreds of others have been secretly sheltered by courageous Polish families, who risk prosecution for assisting illegal immigration. Primary responsibility for these appalling scenes naturally lies with the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, whose decision to open up a putative route into the EU played politics with desperate people’s lives. But instead of responding from the moral high ground, Europe battened down the hatches. In October, Poland’s nationalist government passed legislation authorising the “pushback” of asylum seekers, brazenly flouting the Geneva conventions. The European Commission has itself put forward proposals to allow countries to suspend protections for asylum seekers during similar emergencies. Greece and Spain, which have accused Turkey and Morocco respectively of Lukashenko-style tactics, will have taken note. From Croatia to the Greek islands, unacknowledged pushbacks of asylum seekers are commonplace; 12 EU member states have formally requested that the rules governing movement across borders (the Schengen borders code) be updated to allow the financing of physical barriers to keep migrants out. Outside the EU, Britain is also treating international norms as optional. The government’s nationality and borders bill seeks to criminalise asylum seekers crossing the Channel and remove arrivals to third-country processing centres, both measures in apparent contravention of the 1951 convention. It is scarcely surprising that Agnès Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International, should recently warn: “We are [taking away] bit by bit all the rule-of-law system infrastructure that’s been built over the last decades.” The moral retreat is taking place only six years after Angela Merkel said “we can manage this”, as a million Syrian refugees sought sanctuary from civil war. At the time, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, was widely condemned over the erection of a border fence to keep the refugees out. “We have only just torn down walls in Europe; we should not be putting them up,” observed a European Commission spokesperson. But that was then. The exploitation of the 2015 crisis by the populist right now haunts the imagination of mainstream European leaders, while the ongoing failure to agree a common system of refugee quotas has further shifted the policy dial in a draconian direction. Modish concepts such as “hybrid warfare”, and the language of breaking the “business models” of people smugglers, are legitimising indifference to the plight of vulnerable people. The certain prospect of rising levels of migration, as a result of global heating, is likely to up the ante still further. During the standoff with Mr Lukashenko, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, advised a German newspaper: “It is clear that if we are not able to keep thousands of immigrants at bay now … if we do not resolutely protect and defend our borders, hundreds of millions from Africa and the Middle East will try to get to Europe.” The price of this hardening of hearts is inevitably paid by the hungry, the thirsty, the cold and the exiled. To adapt Voltaire, in Britain and across Europe, irregular migrants are being treated with performative cruelty to discourage the others. Earlier this month in Kent, the chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, condemned as intolerable the conditions in which hundreds of newly arrived asylum seekers were being held. They were unfit, he commented, “even for a small number of people”. Among those detained on the south coast was a 16-year-old girl suffering from fuel burns, who was left untreated for two days. The seams of her damp jeans became embedded in the wounds, leaving permanent scars. This is, clearly, a minor episode in comparison with the drowning of 27 people during a small boat crossing in November. But it is indicative of times in which the urgent humanitarian insight that underpinned the refugee convention is being lost. Of course, work must be done to establish safe, legal routes, and solutions must be found to deal with the reality of economic migration in an unequal world. But when directly confronted with the suffering of the vulnerable stranger, the only ethical response is to offer food, drink, warmth and compassion – and to listen to their story. Having learned this lesson seven decades ago, 21st-century Europe is in danger of forgetting it all over again.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on compassion for the stranger: not found in Fortress Europe | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/26/the-guardian-view-on-compassion-for-the-stranger-not-found-in-fortress-europe
