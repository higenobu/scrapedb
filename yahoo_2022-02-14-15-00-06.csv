2/14/2022,"People have been comparing Arnold Schwarzenegger to a Greek god ever since the '70s, when he dominated the Mr. Olympia physique competition year after year and became one of the most famous bodybuilders in the world before moving onto acting. The Terminator star's latest role, as the lightning god Zeus, makes it official. Schwarzenegger had already teased his casting in BMW's new ad campaign in a short sketch where a barista struggles to pronounce his name right, and now you can see the full commercial, which c0-stars Salma Hayek as Zeus' wife, the goddess Hera. The Super Bowl commercial sees the king and queen of the gods (decked out in full sword-and-sandal couture) decide that the time has come for them to retire, and so they move from Mount Olympus to somewhere a little more prosaic: Palm Springs. However, it's not all golf and walking their pet Pegasus for Schwarzenegger's Zeus, who finds himself having to use his lightning powers over and over again to help their new friends and neighbors with their finickety appliances, to increasing amounts of frustration. Sensing he could do with a ""pick-me-up,"" Hayek's Hera treats Zeus to a new car: the BMW iX, ""the ultimate electric driving machine"" which won't require any jumpstarts from a lightning bolt. The TV spot closes on Zeus and Hera taking a leisurely drive through Palm Springs, singing along to 'Electric Avenue' by Eddy Grant. Anyone who knows a single thing about ancient Greek mythology will be able to tell you that Zeus and Hera were not the sort of couple to comfortably retire together—infidelity, illegitimate children and blood-drenched vengeance were more their thing—but it's still pretty neat to see Schwarzenegger and Hayek playing the mythological figures on screen, albeit briefly.
