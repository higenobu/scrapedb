1/17/2022,"After a slew of close loyalists followed Dominic Cummings out the door in November 2020, Boris Johnson had a tough task appointing a new chief of staff and director of communications. He opted to promote his well-connected press secretary, Jack Doyle, and hire an outsider, Dan Rosenfield. Sarah Sands, a former editor of the Evening Standard and Radio 4’s Today programme and Peter Dominiczak, a former political editor of the Daily Telegraph, were said to have turned the jobs down.  Now, with both Rosenfield and Doyle rumoured to be on their way out, Johnson is facing a dilemma of persuading former loyalists to return or an experienced professional to take a risk on his – currently chaotic – reign in Downing Street. Both jobs would ordinarily be coveted by ambitious professionals, but Whitehall sources say there is significant reluctance to take on the roles – not least because any new office holders would be likely to have their own lockdown activities under immediate scrutiny. Conservative MPs have been clamouring for Johnson to appoint a party man or woman, with a deep understanding of the Tories and campaigning experience. In other words they are expecting someone with a deep understanding of rightwing politics who can push the party in that direction. The other delicate matter is the prime minister’s wife, Carrie Johnson. An experienced PR professional herself who ran communications for Conservative campaign headquarters, she has very specific ideas about how the operation should be run, and clashed with the former director of communications Lee Cain, who rejected the chief of staff role and resigned. There are also other options for ambitious Conservative campaigners and communicators. “Boris will be gone soon,” one senior Tory official observed. “Any big guns who want to work in No 10 will be hitching their horse to Rishi’s team.” Sir Edward Lister A former chief of staff and one of Johnson’s veteran loyalists. Johnson is reported to have asked Lister to return to No 10 several times since his departure in January last year. Lister himself has been caught in multiple conflict-of-interest stories and would most likely take some significant convincing to return. David Canzini A former head of campaigns for the Conservatives who now works alongside the elections guru Sir Lynton Crosby, Canzini is the name on many Tory MPs’ lips – though he is believed to think of it as a poisoned chalice. “Canzini’s not Einstein but he’s practical; he works hard; he understands the Tory party,” one former cabinet minister said. “He was on Boris’s campaign, so he’s trusted.” Meg Powell-Chandler A senior No 10 staffer with comms experiences whose stock is high in Downing Street, Powell-Chandler is one of the “musketeers” of Michael Gove loyalists inside No 10 in senior roles, the others being Henry Cook and Henry Newman, under the deputy chief of staff, Simone Finn. All four are also close to Carrie Johnson. Any could be bumped up to one of the top jobs. Paul Stephenson Stephenson was one of the key figures in Vote Leave, and securing him for No 10 would be a coup for Johnson. A former political adviser, Stephenson co-founded the advisory firm Hanbury Strategy and would take some tempting to leave for a volatile Downing Street. Lynn Davidson The Sun’s former Whitehall editor was special adviser to Penny Mordaunt at the Ministry of Defence and then moved to the private sector, returning to lead Alok Sharma’s communications for Cop26. Whitehall sources say she impressed in the role. Jess Glover A director general of the Cabinet Office, Glover is being tipped by the Sunday Times as Reynolds’ replacement. Others tipped for promotion: Oliver Dowden’s spad, Lucy Noakes, the No 10 press officer Sophie True.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson faces recruitment dilemma amid Downing Street chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/17/boris-johnson-faces-recruitment-dilemma-amid-downing-street-chaos
1/17/2022,"There is so much that could go wrong even between Monday morning and Saturday that it feels reckless to suggest it, but it is increasingly likely that the Clarence House Chase at Ascot this weekend could be that rarest of races over jumps: a season-defining, perhaps even an era-defining, contest which will unfold with something other than Cleeve Hill at Cheltenham as the backdrop.  Shishkin and Energumene, the outstanding two-mile chasers in the UK and Ireland respectively, both stood their ground for Saturday’s Grade One at the five-day stage on Monday morning. First Flow, last year’s winner and something of an Ascot specialist, remains a potential runner too and if all three go to post, we could well see the best jumps race outside the Festival since Moscow Flyer beat Azertyuiop and Well Chief in the 2004 Tingle Creek. As was also the case at Sandown 18 years ago, Shishkin and Energumene will be meeting for the first time if they line up on Saturday, but unlike the main protagonists in 2004 – who took the Arkle Trophy in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively – they are both eight-year-old, second-season chasers. Energumene was scratched from last season’s Arkle just a few days before the Festival, and bitterly disappointing though that was at the time, a 10-month delay has only increased the anticipation. Bookmakers – and, presumably, punters – seem fairly confident that Shishkin will emerge in front when the two horses finally meet. Nicky Henderson’s chaser is chalked up at a top price of 8-15 for Saturday’s race with Energumene – who would be racing outside Ireland for the first time - on 9-4. In the Champion Chase betting, meanwhile, Shishkin is 11-10 to follow up his Arkle win at the Festival in March, with Energumene on 5-2.

On the ratings, though, there is almost nothing between them. The much-respected Timeform operation has Shishkin 1lb in front of Energumene, but Energumene dispatched his three rivals in a Grade One novice at Punchestown in April with every bit as much authority as Shishkin showed at Grade Two level at Kempton last month. Neither horse has ever been extended over fences and it is impossible to say which of them might find the decisive finishing kick if they land over the last side-by-side. Ascot will hope to welcome around 10,000 racegoers on Saturday but this promises to be one of those races that many times more will make a point of watching live, wherever they are and whatever they happen to be doing. In the age of the smartphone, of course, that no longer means having to find a betting shop if you are out and about on a Saturday afternoon. Back in 2004, somewhat bizarrely, I ended up watching Moscow Flyer win the Tingle Creek in a bookies at Brighton Marina, standing next to the man who happened to run it: the notorious – and subsequently jailed – former punter, John “Jock” McCracken. The surroundings will feel a little less intimidating at Ascot on Saturday, but the race itself, hopefully, will live just as long in the memory.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Energumene and Shishkin can stage a race for the ages | Greg Wood,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/talking-horses-energumene-and-shishkin-can-stage-a-race-for-the-ages
1/17/2022,"Thaddeus and Nanci, the subjects of Laura Plancarte’s intimate documentary, make for an idiosyncratic couple. While the bubbly Nanci has a natural, charismatic openness, Thaddeus is much more elusive and reserved. Still, their differences run deeper than a matter of contrasting personalities. Thaddeus, born into the Northern Cheyenne tribe, was removed from his Native American community at a young age. Meanwhile, Nanci, who is white, grew up on a Lakota reservation. Despite the differences in their backgrounds, what Nanci and Thaddeus do share – apart from their love for each other – is a difficult childhood, marred by domestic abuse and financial precariousness – the same stories of disenfranchisement that ripple through generations of Native Americans living in Montana. Conversations that Thaddeus and Nanci have with their friends and neighbours make free mention of suicide and addiction, spoken with a tragic matter-of-factness.  These intergenerational traumas form a wedge between the pair as they prepare for their wedding. Thaddeus wants Nanci to adhere to the traditional roles of a Northern Cheyenne woman; this means leaving all the household domestic responsibilities to her. On the other hand, Nanci, who has a PhD and works at a university, feels sorely burdened by these expectations. Still, while Thaddeus’s attitude is outdated, the film as well as Nanci don’t make simple judgment calls – both acknowledge that such mindsets stem from an innate need to cling to one’s disappearing heritage. While several of Plancarte’s stylistic choices are at times odd, including an on-the-nose inclusion of Ben Rogers’s Cowboys and Indians tune, the film is a heartfelt ode to the resilience of love that can triumph over differences.

1/17/2022,"The world’s 20 top performing hedge fund managers earned a record $65.4bn ($48bn) profit for their clients in 2021 after bets placed on rising stock markets paid off. The biggest winner was TCI, the fund run by British billionaire Sir Chris Hohn, which made a gain of $9.5bn last year, according to the annual rankings by LCH Investments.  TCI, which manages about $44bn of assets and is known in the City and on Wall Street as one of the most aggressive activist investors, made a gain of 23.3% in 2021. TCI, which stands for the Children’s Investment fund, has made total gains of $36.5bn since it was set up in 2003. Hohn, a philanthropist and climate crisis activist, paid himself $152m last year, less than a third of the $475m he received the previous year. He has pumped more than £4bn into his personal children’s charity and in recent years has taken on a second cause: the climate crisis, promising to use TCI’s $44bn of investments to “force change on companies who refuse to take their environmental emissions seriously”. Hohn is the single biggest individual donor to Extinction Rebellion (XR), which has staged high-profile climate protests around the world. “Humanity is aggressively destroying the world with climate change and there is an urgent need for us all to wake up to this fact,” he said when he was revealed as XR’s main funder. The top 20 hedge funds returned 10.5% on average, making total gains of $65.4bn, up from $63.5bn and the most since LCH started collating the data in 2010. “The net profit generated by the top 20 managers for investors was the highest ever,” Rick Sopher, the chair of LCH said. “While hedge funds have not been the best performers of the past decade, they may become more useful if the market environment changes, which it inevitably will,” he added. “Equity markets have been soaring and bond markets are precarious, so the risks of traditional equity and bond investors losing money in the future are high and rising.” The second-best performing fund was Citadel, a US fund run by Ken Griffin, the world’s 54th wealthiest person with an estimated personal fortune of $27.5bn. Last year, Citadel made $8.2bn, a 26% return. In 2019 Griffin bought a Grade II* Georgian mansion within sight of Buckingham Palace for almost £100m. He purchased 3 Carlton Gardens, which overlooks the Mall and St James’s Park in central London, for £95m. He owns string of luxury properties across the world, including the most expensive ever sold in New York, Chicago and Miami. Last year he bought a four-level penthouse at the top of Chicago’s No 9 Walton apartment complex for $58.8m. When it is fitted out the apartment will feature a private pool and several balconies. Griffin mostly lives and works in Chicago, where Citadel is based, and also owns a condominium that occupies the whole of the 37th floor of the city’s Waldorf Astoria hotel.",News/Business,Extinction Rebellion donor leads world’s top-performing hedge fund,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/17/billionaire-philanthropist-leads-worlds-top-performing-hedge-funds
1/17/2022,"The new German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, sought to reassure a nervous Ukraine that she will not allow Germany to compromise on the basic principles of Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty when she meets the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow for the first time on Tuesday. Baerbock, a member of the Green party, said on a visit to Kyiv she was ready for serious dialogue with Russia about mutual security, but was not willing to backtrack “on basic principles such as territorial inviolability, the free choice of alliances and the renunciation of the threat of violence”.  She said Moscow, which has massed troops on Ukraine’s borders, would suffer if it launched an attack. “Each further aggressive act will have a high price for Russia, economically, strategically, politically,” she told a news conference with her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba. “Diplomacy is the only way.” Her visit is being watched warily by European, UK and US administrations for signs that Germany may revert to its traditional role of seeking independent dialogue with Russia in preference to firmness. Baerbock is seen as part of younger generation of German politicians strongly committed to projecting human rights in foreign policy and determined to take Germany away from its historic willingness to compromise with Moscow, but the SPD-led German chancellery is thought less inclined to break with the policy of the former German chancellor Angela Merkel. It will be deeply frustrating for some other western states if Germany continues to act as a drag anchor as Europe and the US have been making strenuous efforts to present a united front inside Nato. Her visit comes after three high-level diplomatic meetings last week ended with Russian troops still on Ukraine’s borders, but no definitive sign whether Putin would risk a military incursion or instead start talks with the US about arms control in Europe, a more limited agenda than his call for a redrawing of the security architecture of Europe. Parts of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Luhansk and Donetsk have been controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014. Despite the Minsk peace plan negotiated under Franco-German mediation, the conflict continues and the terms for elections in the regions are disputed. Baerbock said in Kyiv she would explore in Moscow if there could be a return to the four-way Normandy format negotiations with Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France that have been on hold for a long time. There has been talk the US may join the talks to restore some energy into them. “I want to find out on the ground whether there is a willingness to find solutions through diplomatic channels – above all, to breathe life into the Normandy process again and finally make progress in implementing the Minsk agreements,” she said. “The most effective lever we have to back Ukraine is the unanimous commitment of the EU, the G7 and Nato that any further aggression would come at a high price for the Russian regime […] And we mean that very seriously,” she said. “No country has the right to dictate to other countries which direction they may take, which relationships they may have and which alliances they may enter into. Ukraine’s sovereignty can and will never be subject of negotiations.” She rejected calls for Germany to supply arms to Ukraine, citing a “historical responsibility” for Germany not to export weapons to conflict zones, but said Berlin was willing to provide technical expertise to help Ukraine defend itself from cyber-attack. Andrij Melnyk, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, said earlier in comments to the dpa press agency he found the ban “very frustrating and bitter […] the world is currently facing the greatest danger of a huge war in the middle of Europe, the worst since 1945.” The debate in Europe on Russia and Ukraine is playing out on three levels: the continued political viability of the Nord Stream pipeline from Russia to Germany given Europe’s gas shortages; whether Germany should relax its ban on sending weapons to Ukraine; and finally, the extent of the economic sanctions that should be placed on Russia if it did invade Ukraine. Baerbock is aware that Joe Biden last week fought off a Republican attempt in the Senate to slap sanctions back on Nord Stream 2, which bypasses Ukraine, largely because he wanted to stay in harness with Germany. If there is no reciprocation from Germany, the Biden team will have to review its strategy. The pipeline is complete but cannot be used since German and EU regulators have yet to decide if it breaches either German or EU competition laws. The delay allows the German coalition government to avoid an internal split on the issue, but it is clear the SPD want it to go ahead while the Greens, who are in charge of the foreign and climate change ministries, do not. Yuriy Vitrenko, the head of the Ukrainian energy company Naftogaz, has claimed Germany would have economic advantages if Nord Stream 2 made it the most important distribution point for Russian gas but the whole point of the pipeline was for Putin to punish Ukraine for choosing Europe over Moscow. “After we signed the Association Agreement with the EU, Russia decided to build Nord Stream 2. So that we lose revenue from gas transportation. If Germany benefits economically from Russia’s punishment of Ukraine – do you call that fair?” he asked. The claim by the new German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, that the project is purely commercial is not shared in Poland, France or the UK. Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, said Europe needed to be less dependent on Russian energy. “Our economies must not depend on the geopolitical considerations of Russia, Ukraine or other parts of the world,” he said. Baerbock, who at one point referred to the Russian regime, as opposed to the government, in her Kyiv press conference also repeated a German offer to help Ukraine develop hydrogen technology as an alternative to gas.",News/World news,"Russia would pay ‘high price’ for attack on Ukraine, says German minister",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/russia-ukraine-attack-german-minister-annalena-baerbock

It was Wang’s first win on tour since last year’s French Open, where she beat Su-Wei Hsieh in the first round before losing to Gauff in the second.  Gauff saved four match points from 5-0 down on Monday, but that was the only good news in a match in which the American made 38 unforced errors. “It’s just learning when do I play my best tennis, and today wasn’t the best tennis,” the 17-year-old Gauff.
