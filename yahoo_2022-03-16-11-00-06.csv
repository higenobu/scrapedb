3/16/2022,"The Republican National Committee is suing its own email vendor, Salesforce, in a last-ditch effort to stop it from turning over extensive internal data to the Jan. 6 select committee, Axios has learned. Driving the news: The RNC is seeking an emergency injunction to block the software giant from complying with a subpoena from the panel investigating the Capitol riot by a 10am ET Wednesday deadline. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free Why it matters: Absent an injunction, the committee would gain access to extensive data on RNC and Trump campaign fundraising practices. It's seeking that information as part of an investigation into the use of false claims about 2020 election fraud to raise money for Trump-aligned political efforts. The subpoenaed records include extensive information on who at the RNC sent its fundraising emails, who received them and how effective they were at raising money in the wake of the 2020 election. Details: The subpoena seeks RNC and Trump campaign fundraising data gleaned from its use of Salesforce email marketing software. The RNC is also amending a lawsuit filed last week against the committee to include Salesforce as a defendant. Axios reviewed copies of both the amended complaint and the injunction motion. Between the lines: The RNC says Salesforce made initial assurances it would not turn over that data while its lawsuit against the committee was pending. But one day after Axios reported on the lawsuit, Salesforce told the RNC it was legally obligated to produce the requested records and would do so regardless of the litigation, the amended complaint says. What they're saying: The RNC has ""asked the court to expedite consideration of the case,” chief counsel Justin Riemer told Axios in an emailed statement. It's added Salesforce to the lawsuit, he said, ""in order to protect the constitutional rights of the Republican Party and its millions of supporters."" ""Even though the court has yet to weigh in, the Select Committee demands that Salesforce immediately turn over the private data of millions of Americans and the RNC’s political strategy, which lie at the heart of our lawsuit."" A Salesforce spokesperson declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Jan. 6 committee also declined to comment. Don’t forget: The RNC has been alleging that the Jan. 6 Committee is not properly structured and therefore lacks subpoena power at all. Experts told Axios last week that courts have traditionally been reluctant to limit Congress' investigative powers, but that an RNC victory in the case — which also alleges First and Fourth Amendment violations — is not out of the question.

3/16/2022,"The besieged city of Mariupol is suffering such a devastating toll that street cleaners are collecting the bodies of civilians killed during the Russian onslaught, the city's deputy mayor has said. The city, situated in the south-west of Ukraine, has found itself at the centre of the invasion, with 2,500 residents reportedly killed as a result of the Russian invasion. ""We can't bury [the victims] in private graves, as those are outside the city and the perimeter is controlled by Russian troops,"" Mariupol's deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC. Heavy Russian shelling has prevented any mass evacuation from the besieged port city, despite efforts to open safe routes for civilians to escape through. Promised ceasefires have been routinely broken by Russian troops. On Sunday, the city council said the civilian death toll had reached 2,100. By Monday, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said that figure had risen to 2,500. Orlov said he could not give a total for dead civilians buried in mass graves, but that 67 bodies were at one site. ""Some we can't identify but some had documents,"" he said, and then went on to reveal that the situation was so dire street cleaners and road repair teams were having to collect bodies in the streets because municipal services have collapsed. He added: ""Some people were killed during those collections. We've had no electricity, or heating, sanitation, water, food for 11 days."" Orlov said that thousands of residents are hiding in cellars beneath the city, and some are burying family members privately in courtyards or gardens. In a video message on Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the families of the 79 children killed in the war “had been destroyed’’. Watch: Drone footage shows destruction to the city of Mariupol Zelensky emphasized the plight of Mariupol, a port city of 430,000, which is surrounded by Russian troops. “They are bombing it 24 hours a day, launching missiles"" he said. Recalling the destruction of a maternity hospital in the city last Wednesday, he said: “It is hatred. They kill children. They destroy maternity hospitals. They destroy hospitals, why? So Ukraine has no more children.” On Monday it was announced that a pregnant woman who had been pictured clasping her bloodstained stomach as paramedics carried her through the wreckage of the hospital after the bomb attack, had died. According to the Associated Press news agency, the woman was rushed to another hospital where doctors worked to keep her alive. Realising she was losing her baby, medics said she cried out to them:, “Kill me now!”. Surgeon Timur Marin said the woman's pelvis had been crushed and her hip detached. Medics delivered the baby via cesarean section, but it showed “no signs of life,” the surgeon said. After a further 30 minutes of resuscitation attempts Marin said medics had to give up. “Both died,"" he said. On Saturday, Ukraine's foreign ministry said that Russian military had shelled a mosque in Mariupol where over 80 adults and children were sheltering. Russian president Vladimir Putin initially said that his invasion of Ukraine would not target any civilians, but the offensive has since bombed multiple towns and cities, resulting in a massive refugee crisis. Foreign officials have said that Russia is targeting civilians to try and ""break morale."" On Monday, a Ukrainian woman living in Kent said “all we can do is hope” after not hearing from her family in Mariupol for 12 days. Last week, Yuliya Campbell, 36, from Kent said it was “torture” not knowing if her family were OK. Mrs Campbell, who was born and grew up in the southern Ukrainian city, said her family members are thought to be among tens of thousands of civilians trapped in the city.",World/Yahoo News UK,Street cleaners collect dead bodies in Ukraine after thousands killed by Russian troops,https://news.yahoo.com/street-cleaners-collect-dead-bodies-ukraine-thousands-killed-150437702.html
